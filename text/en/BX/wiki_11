<doc id="662787" wikidata="Q3607962" url="?curid=662787" title="Elliptic partial differential equation">
<text>In mathematics, an elliptic partial differential equation is a type of partial differential equation (PDE). In mathematical modeling, elliptic PDEs are frequently used to model steady states, unlike parabolic PDE and hyperbolic PDE which generally model phenomena that change in time. They are also important in pure mathematics, where they are fundamental to various fields of research such as differential geometry and optimal transport.

==Definition==
Elliptic differential equations appear in many different contexts and levels of generality. 

First consider a second-order linear PDE in two variables, written in the form
formula_1
where , , , , , , and are functions of and , using subscript notation for the partial derivatives. The PDE is called elliptic if
formula_2
with this naming convention inspired by the equation for a planar ellipse. Equations with formula_3 are termed parabolic while those with formula_4 are hyperbolic.

For a general linear second-order PDE, the &quot;unknown&quot; function can be a function of any number of independent variables; the equation is of the form
formula_5
where , , and are functions defined on the domain subject to the symmetry . This equation is called elliptic if, when is viewed as a function on the domain valued in the space of symmetric matrices, all of the eigenvalues are greater than some set positive number. Equivalently, this means that there is a positive number such that
formula_6
for any point in the domain and any real numbers .

The simplest example of a second-order linear elliptic PDE is the Laplace equation, in which is zero if and is one otherwise, and where . The Poisson equation is a slightly more general second-order linear elliptic PDE, in which is not required to vanish. For both of these equations, the ellipticity constant can be taken to be .

The terminology &quot;elliptic partial differential equation&quot; is not used consistently throughout the literature. What is called &quot;elliptic&quot; by some authors is called &quot;strictly elliptic&quot; or &quot;uniformly elliptic&quot; by others.
===Nonlinear and higher-order equations===
Ellipticity can also be formulated for much more general classes of equations. For the most general second-order PDE, which is of the form
:formula_7
for some given function , ellipticity is defined by linearizing the equation and applying the above linear definition. Since linearization is done at a particular function , this means that ellipticity of a nonlinear second-order PDE depends not only on the equation itself but also on the solutions under consideration. For example, in the simplest kind of Monge–Ampère equation, the determinant of the hessian matrix of a function is prescribed:
:formula_8
As follows from Jacobi&#x27;s formula for the derivative of a determinant, this equation is elliptic if is a positive function and solutions satisfy the constraint of being uniformly convex.

There are also higher-order elliptic PDE, the simplest example being the fourth-order biharmonic equation. Even more generally, there is an important class of &quot;elliptic systems&quot; which consist of coupled partial differential equations for multiple &#x27;unknown&#x27; functions. For example, the Cauchy–Riemann equations from complex analysis can be viewed as a first-order elliptic system for a pair of two-variable functions.

Moreover, the class of elliptic PDE (of any order, including systems) is subject to various notions of weak solutions, i.e., reformulating the above equations in such a way that allows for solutions to have various irregularities (e.g. non-differentiability, singularities or discontinuities) while still adhering to the laws of physics. Additionally, these type of solutions are also important in variational calculus, where the direct method often produces weak solutions of elliptic systems of Euler equations.

==Canonical form==
Consider a second-order elliptic partial differential equation
:formula_9
for a two-variable function . This equation is linear in the &quot;leading-order terms&quot; but allows nonlinear expressions involving the function values and their first derivatives; this is sometimes called a quasilinear equation.

A &quot;canonical form&quot; asks for a transformation and of the domain so that, when is viewed as a function of and , the above equation takes the form
:formula_10
for some new function . The existence of such a transformation can be established &quot;locally&quot; if , , and are real-analytic functions and, with more elaborate work, even if they are only continuously differentiable. Locality means that the necessary coordinate transformations may fail to be defined on the entire domain of , although they can be established in some small region surrounding any particular point of the domain.

Formally establishing the existence of such transformations uses the existence of solutions to the Beltrami equation. From the perspective of differential geometry, the existence of a canonical form is equivalent to the existence of isothermal coordinates for the associated Riemannian metric
:formula_11
on the domain. (The ellipticity condition for the PDE, namely the positivity of the function , is what ensures that either this tensor or its negation is indeed a Riemannian metric.) Generally, for second-order quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations for functions of &quot;more&quot; than two variables, a canonical form does not exist. This corresponds to the fact that, although isothermal coordinates generally exist for Riemannian metrics in two dimensions, they only exist for very particular Riemannian metrics in higher dimensions.

===Characteristics and regularity===
For the general second-order linear PDE, characteristics are defined as the null directions for the associated tensor
:formula_12
called the principal symbol. Using the technology of the wave front set, characteristics are significant in understanding how irregular points of propagate to the solution of the PDE. Informally, the wave front set of a function consists of the points of non-smoothness, in addition to the directions in frequency space causing the lack of smoothness. It is a fundamental fact that the application of a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients can only have the effect of removing points from the wave front set. However, all points of the original wave front set (and possibly more) are recovered by adding back in the (real) characteristic directions of the operator.

In the case of a linear &quot;elliptic&quot; operator with smooth coefficients, the principal symbol is a Riemannian metric and there are no real characteristic directions. According to the previous paragraph, it follows that the wave front set of a solution coincides exactly with that of . This sets up a basic &quot;regularity theorem&quot;, which says that if is smooth (so that its wave front set is empty) then the solution is smooth as well. More generally, the points where fails to be smooth coincide with the points where is not smooth. This &quot;regularity&quot; phenomena is in sharp contrast with, for example, hyperbolic PDE in which discontinuities can form even when all the coefficients of an equation are smooth.

Solutions of elliptic PDEs are naturally associated with time-independent solutions of parabolic PDEs or hyperbolic PDEs. For example, a time-independent solution of the heat equation solves Laplace&#x27;s equation. That is, if parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs are associated with modeling dynamical systems then the solutions of elliptic PDEs are associated with steady states. Informally, this is reflective of the above regularity theorem, as steady states are generally smoothed out versions of truly dynamical solutions. However, PDE used in modeling are often nonlinear and the above regularity theorem only applies to &quot;linear&quot; elliptic equations; moreover, the regularity theory for nonlinear elliptic equations is much more subtle, with solutions not always being smooth.

<text>The Battle of Honkaniemi was fought between Finnish and Soviet forces on 26 February 1940. This battle was notable for being fought by tanks, the only time they were used en masse in combat by Finnish forces in the Winter War.

The commander of the Finnish II Corps, General Harald Öhquist, had attached the Jaeger Battalion 3 and the 4th company of the Armoured Battalion to the 23rd Division.

The 23rd was responsible for the area around Lake Näykkijärvi, just to the southeast of Viipuri, the second largest town in Finland. Also, the 3rd Battalion of the 67th Infantry Regiment that was on loan to the 5th division arrived as well, giving the reinforcement that the commander of the 23rd Division, Colonel Voldemar Oinonen, needed to launch an attack against the Soviets. At 10:15 pm, the commander of the Jaeger Battalion 3, Captain I. Kunnas and Lieutenant O. Heinonen of the 4th Armoured Company received orders to attack.

==Plan==
The original plan had involved six infantry battalions, four artillery battalions and the 4th Armoured Company. However, due to the haste to get the plan up and running, the planners missed important aspects of the battle, therefore reducing the overall number of units to four infantry battalions, two artillery battalions and the all important 4th Tank Company.

==Assault==
On the nights of 25 and 26 February, members of the Jaeger Battalion were carried by truck to Heponotko, which was about three km away from a depot in Honkaniemi (now Lebedevka). They then skied to the start point at 4:00 am. The tank company arrived around 30 minutes later after a 50 km march. That journey, however, cost them more than they would have liked. Since the conditions of the weather and roads were equally bad, the tank company lost five of their 13 Vickers 6-Ton tanks, mostly due to engine failure.

Seeing this as a major blow to their offensive capabilities, Captain Kunnas split his remaining tanks between the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Jaeger Companies. Six tanks were to support the Jaegers while two were to help the 1st secure the left flank. It was decided that the attack would commence at 5:00 am, but communication with the artillery battalions failed; so it was decided that they would try again at 6:15 am.

When communications with the artillery battalions were restored, the time had come to attack. However another setback had occurred. During the preliminary artillery barrage, some of the shells landed at the start point, resulting in 30 Finns being killed or wounded. The attack had to be postponed by another hour.

===Beginning===
After the initial bombardment by two artillery battalions (the 1st Battalions of the 5th and 21st Artillery Regiments), the attack commenced. Nevertheless, the Finns had had another set-back, another two tanks had been lost to technical failure, thereby reducing the total Finnish Tanks to only six for the entire battle. Even after all these set-backs, there were more to come. The 1st Jaeger Battalion had advanced some 200 meters before having to halt under heavy fire from the Red Army. The 1st Jaeger Company which was covering the left flank, advanced towards the railroad only to be unable to cross it. The 2nd and 3rd Jaeger Companies, which were the main attack force, had advanced to 200 meters southwest of the railroad, but had to be stopped.

===Tank backup===
The 4th Armoured Company had one of the worst days ever. One of its tanks got stuck in a ditch; the turret was damaged in the process and it had to retreat back to the starting point. The remaining five tanks were lost in a more honourable way, &quot;being targeted by T-26s, T-28s and 45 mm anti-tank guns&quot;.

The platoon commander&#x27;s tank, Lt.V. Mikkola&#x27;s, advanced the farthest, almost 500 meters, almost into the Soviet lines. Only two Finnish tanks were able to destroy other Soviet tanks, the tank of Corporal E. Seppälä, which had kept on fighting after being immobilized, had taken out two Soviet tanks before the crew had to abandon their vehicle. The other tank was commanded by 2nd Lt. J. Virniö, which had destroyed one tank before being damaged.

===Finnish retreat===
Captain Kunnas received orders at 10:00 pm that he was to abort the attack and retreat. The Finns&#x27; first tank battle met with an unsuccessful end. The entire tank battle had been fought with inexperienced crews and almost no radio communication. In order to save money, the tanks had been bought from the UK without guns, optics and radios, and some even without the driver&#x27;s seat. Due to the lack of vital equipment, communication between tanks was impossible and the tanks had to act upon their own judgement.

==Aftermath==
The battle caused the deaths of one NCO while injuring two officers and two NCOs; three privates were reported missing in action. Even though the Soviets had a huge advantage over the Finns in numbers and weapons, the Finnish troopers pressed home the attack.

On 27 February 1940 the remaining eight tanks of the 4th Tank Company were ordered to move to the Rautalampi area for anti-tank duties.

According to Russian sources during the day of 26 February, six Finnish tanks were destroyed in two separate engagements. No losses to their own tanks were recorded. The journal of the 35th Armored Brigade states: &quot;Two Vickers tanks with infantry backup advanced to the right flank of [the] 245th Infantry Regiment. Both enemy tanks were destroyed in the following battle. Four Vickers tanks moved to their help, but were destroyed by three T-26 tanks of companies commanders on [a] recon mission.&quot;

<doc id="662793" wikidata="Q1081001" url="?curid=662793" title="Velvia">
<text>Velvia is a brand of daylight-balanced color reversal film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. The original incarnation of the film was called &quot;Velvia for Professionals&quot;, known as RVP, a classification code meaning &quot;Reversal/Velvia/Professional series&quot;. It is known for its extremely high level of color saturation and image quality.

Velvia (RVP) was introduced in 1990. It has brighter and generally more accurate color reproduction (though many see its high color saturation as unrealistic), finer grain, twice the speed, and a more convenient process (E-6). Kodachrome 25 fell out of popularity a few years after Velvia was introduced (in part because of Kodak&#x27;s lack of interest in promoting their film); Kodachrome 64 and 200 followed more slowly. Kodachrome 25 had previously been considered the film to which all other films had been compared, and cannot fairly be compared to Velvia, as Kodachrome is an entirely different process, in which the image is produced with &quot;color clouds&quot; more so than grain.

Velvia has the highest resolving power of any slide film. A 35 mm Velvia slide can resolve up to 160 lines per mm.

==Appearance==
Velvia has very saturated colors under daylight, high contrast, and exceptional sharpness. These characteristics make it the slide film of choice for many nature photographers.

==Speeds==
===Velvia (RVP)===
The original Velvia (RVP) was an ISO 50 film. In practice, many photographers used an exposure index (EI) of 40 or 32 to increase exposure slightly (one or two thirds of a stop respectively) in order to yield less saturated colors and more shadow detail. It was discontinued in 2005.

===Velvia 50===
Velvia 50 (RVP50) was reintroduced, on the new film base, in 2007 after announcements under the provisional name Velvia II. The original Velvia (RVP) had been discontinued because of difficulties in obtaining some of the raw materials needed to make the emulsion. Fuji R&amp;D created a new emulsion which substituted different materials in its manufacture yet retained the appearance of the classic Velvia.

===Velvia 100===
Velvia 100 (RVP 100) is about as saturated as the original version (RVP) but was designed to more accurate in color reproduction. It used the new &quot;Super-fine Sigma-crystal&quot; technology which ended the need for larger grain size to achieve greater film speed. The newer speed also has finer grain (an RMS granularity value of 8), and uses the color correction layers found in Provia 100F. The Advanced DIR Technology releases developer inhibitors release compounds that regulate interlayer and edge effects yielding dramatic improvements in color reproduction. Velvia 100 (RVP 100) was introduced in 2005, to replace the discontinued original Velvia (RVP). The color rendition of Velvia 100 was designed to record all colors even more accurately. Reciprocity failure was reduced for long exposures and dye stability extended. Fujichrome F transparency films held color accuracy for years of archival color stability, while Kodachrome films faded in less than 20 minutes of accrued projection. Fujichrome films went up to 18 hours without fade. Fade is defined by a color shift of at least 10% in any color layer. All Fujichrome product layers faded at the same rate, which means the image could fade 10% but could not color shift. 10% fade was determined to be the effect noticeable by viewers of the images.

On July 6, 2021, Fujifilm announced the discontinuation of Velvia 100 within the United States, effective immediately. The chemical phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1) (PIP (3:1)) (CASRN 68937-41-7), the use of which is banned under the EPA&#x27;s Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), is present in minuscule quantities within the layers of the film. While Fujifilm believes the trace amount is not harmful to the environment, they opted to discontinue the film within the United States out of dedication to sustainability and compliance with the regulation. Their statement does not make it clear if the film will continue to be sold in other markets.

===Velvia 100F===
Velvia 100F (RVP 100F) offers saturated colors, better color fidelity and higher contrast. It was introduced in 2002 and discontinued in 2012 in most formats and markets, and is now only sold as sheet film (4x5&quot; and 8x10&quot;) in Japan only. Velvia 100F is less saturated than RVP50 and is accurate in color rendition with the exception of yellow. It exaggerates this color, especially when there is a slight yellowish cast in the scene. On film, this will be a deeper and more noticeable yellow. Skin color was rendered better.

==Long exposure problems==
The original Velvia (RVP) suffered much more from reciprocity failure than most other films. Exposing the film for as little as 16 seconds produced a color shift, typically to purple or green, depending on shooting conditions. Anything over four seconds requires the use of magenta color correction filters if correct color balance is required, exposures of 64 seconds and longer are &quot;not recommended&quot; by Fuji.

Velvia 100 (RVP 100) is much better with long exposures: no reciprocity failure compensation is required for exposures shorter than 1 minute.

==Velvia in cinematography==
Velvia film stock was available through 2006 and was used for many commercials, but rarely for feature films. Its main use in movies was for shooting stock landscape shots and special-effects background plates. One example is the 1998 film &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, which took place largely within a painting. After being discontinued, the closest replacement for the original Velvia film stock was Eterna Vivid 160, which produced roughly the same color effect while being more easily processed. Since 2013 Fujifilm has ended production of all motion picture film.

Since 2006, Velvia 50 D (also sold as &quot;Cinevia&quot;) is available in Super 8 via three independent companies, &quot;Pro8mm&quot; in the US, and &quot;GK Film&quot; and &quot;Wittner Kinotechnik&quot; in Europe. However, demand for it is higher than those companies together are currently capable of properly supplying. Spectra Film and Video has also been loading Fuji Velvia into Super 8 cartridges and for 16 mm. They recently modified the Kodak-supplied cartridges to ensure a smoother transport of Velvia film through the cartridge.

<doc id="662802" wikidata="Q12407683" url="?curid=662802" title="Severndroog Castle">
<text>Severndroog Castle is a folly designed by architect Richard Jupp, with the first stone laid on 2 April 1784.

While commonly referred to as a castle due to its turrets, it was built as a folly, as can be discerned by its small size and because it has never functioned as a castle. It is situated in Castle Wood, on Shooter&#x27;s Hill in south-east London in the Royal Borough of Greenwich.

It was built to commemorate Commodore Sir William James who, in April 1755, attacked and destroyed the island fortress of Suvarnadurg (then rendered in English: &quot;Severndroog&quot;) of the Maratha Empire on the western coast of India, between Mumbai and Goa. James died in 1783 and the folly was built as a memorial to him by his widow, Lady James of Eltham.

Designated a Grade II* listed building in 1954, the Gothic-style castle is 63 feet (19 m) high and triangular in section, with a hexagonal turret at each corner. From its elevated position, it offers views across London, with features in seven different counties visible on a clear day.

==History==

Sir William James captured the Suvarnadurg fort (Golden fort) on western coast of India on 12 April 1755, this victory and later other triumphs led to change his rank to director in the East India company. 

The tower was used by General William Roy in his trigonometric survey linking the nearby Royal Greenwich Observatory with the Paris Observatory; a 36-inch (0.91 m) theodolite (now in London&#x27;s Science Museum) was temporarily installed on its roof. This Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) led to the formation of the Ordnance Survey. In 1848, the Royal Engineers used the castle for their survey of London.

Following Lady James&#x27; death in 1798, the building passed through the hands of various landowners, including John Blades, a former Sheriff of London, a Mr Barlow (ship owner) who built nearby Castle Wood House, and Thomas Jackson (a railway and docks contractor of Eltham Park). On 18 August 1845, the tower was visited by diarist William Copeland Astbury, who recorded the tower, layout, ownership and condition. In 1922, the tower was purchased by London County Council and it became a local visitor attraction with a ground-floor tearoom serving refreshments. In 1986, when the GLC was abolished, responsibility for Severndroog passed to Greenwich Council.

===Restoration===
In 1988, the local council could no longer afford the building&#x27;s upkeep and it was boarded up. In 2002, a community group, the Severndroog Castle Building Preservation Trust, was established. In 2004, it featured in the BBC TV series &quot;Restoration&quot; (presented by Griff Rhys Jones, Ptolemy Dean and Marianne Suhr) to gain publicity and support to restore the building and open it to the public.

In July 2013 work began on renovating the castle, funded by a £595,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant, and it was officially reopened to the public on 20 July 2014. The castle is open to public visitors and can be hired, wholly or in part, for private functions.

The Green Chain Walk and Capital Ring long-distance paths go through &quot;Eltham Common&quot; and &quot;Castle Wood&quot; and past the castle between Shooter&#x27;s Hill and Eltham.

<doc id="662803" wikidata="Q5183148" url="?curid=662803" title="Crazy English">
<text>Crazy English () is a brand name related to a non-traditional method learning English in mainland China conceived by Li Yang. Li believes that the traditional way of learning English in China is ineffective. Li Yang&#x27;s method places heavy emphasis on practicing English orally. His method can be described with the slogan &quot;By shouting out loud, you learn.&quot; In many ways it remains similar to the traditional pedagogic practices of Chinese education in that it still relies on repetition and recitation. Members of the school administration in China often disapprove of the method because they believe it goes against the traditional Chinese values of modesty and restraint.

== History ==
By 2008, for over a decade China had been gripped by the “English Fever” phenomenon as the country increasingly associated English language skills with success in the business world. Though China states that it has the largest number, 300 million, of English speakers in the world, the number of people who translate their reading and writing skills to spoken word decreases substantially. This issue with students not being comfortable or confident in speaking English opened the door for Li Yang&#x27;s Crazy English method of teaching.

Yang, like many others, struggled with speaking in English. In preparation for his TEM 4 English exam, Yang found that while practicing English he would often time find himself shouting English passages and class exercises aloud; this made him more confident. After only four months of using his new method of studying Yang placed second in his class on the exam.

After graduating Yang started to work as an electrical engineer but also taught English in his spare time using his method of teaching English as a “shouted language”. He later quit his job in 1994 to start his own English teaching company “Li Yang English Promotion Studio&quot; to promote his technique&quot; which he named “Crazy English”. In the following years, Yang&#x27;s method would gain popularity beginning after Ouyang Weijian, the leader of an elementary school asked Yang to teach for a crowd of about five thousand people, Weijian would later go on to join Yang&#x27;s company as his business manager.

One major contribution to Crazy English&#x27;s rise to fame was director Zhang Yuan&#x27;s 1999 documentary Fengkuang Yingyu (“Crazy English”) which gained Crazy English attention, especially in the Western world. Crazy English popularity continued to grow causing more than 20 million people to sign up for a course. Eventually the Chinese government recognized Crazy English as a legitimate teaching method by allowing Yang to teach in Beijing, to teach soldiers on top of the Great Wall of China, as well as conduct Intensive Training Camps to prepare for the 2008 Olympics. Today “Li Yang English Promotion Studio&quot; is a multimillion-dollar business that employs over 150 people with Yang still at the helm as director and principal speaker.

== Etymology ==
The name “Crazy English” comes from the fact that Yang&#x27;s methods are so different from traditional Chinese classroom norms of being restrained. Crazy English goes against these traditions as the method utilizes physical and mental engagement. The word “crazy” is not meant to imply insanity but for Yang&#x27;s belief that everything in life should be done wholeheartedly with passion and abandon. &quot;Crazy stands for the single-minded pursuit of dreams. Crazy stands for the total devotion to your work. Crazy stands for the passion of commitment to reach the goal,&quot; says the course&#x27;s guidebook.

== Methodology ==
Li Yang&#x27;s unconventional method of teaching English includes screaming popular and random English phrases at a rapid pace and occasionally, involves hand movements in patterns that reflect the word&#x27;s pronunciation. In a survey on Crazy English students identified Li Yang&#x27;s technique as one which does not include grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing, or listening comprehension. In 2003, Li in an interview with Kripal Singh said, “[Chinese students] have no problem writing, they have no problem reading. That’s why I trigger their power of speaking.”

Since Crazy English highlights various aspects of learning a language without using any traditional ways like learning grammar or reading textbooks, pronunciation is the backbone of this methodology. Crazy English follows the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as its standard for giving pronunciation notation. Li Yang employed several native English speakers to incorporate exaggerated American pronunciation in his lecture to develop conversation practicality.

Crazy English also makes significant use of gesticulation. Amber R. Woodward offers the example of Crazy English students learning ‘i as in like’ by making the right hand&#x27;s index finger, drawing a complete clockwise circle; similarly, for ‘th as in three’ holding the right hand above the head, bending his hand at the wrist with a flat palm, and moving arm from right to left over one&#x27;s head, also for ‘a as in made’ holding the right hand above the head, bending hand at the wrist with a flat palm, moving arm from front to back over his head. These gesticulations were ridiculed for not being consistent with the hand movements in his various lectures.

Li Yang chooses not to provide vocabulary lists or grammar notes for the words and phrases he uses. In his lectures, Yang sometimes translates English words or phrases into Chinese to focus on the emotion behind the word by reminding the audience of the Chinese translation to make the learning of the word faster. Crazy English uses simple forms of vocabulary and grammar this is why the translation in order to invoke feeling is not necessary every time. Crazy English lectures mostly contain English phrases and not full sentences.

The psychological aspect of the Crazy English method is related to its emphasis on improving speech. Students practice his technique by going behind buildings or on rooftops and shouting English. They also go to his rallies and shout together; this helps them overcome their shyness (everybody is doing it, so nobody is embarrassed). Li&#x27;s frequently used slogan, “Crazy English! Crazy life! Crazy world! I love this crazy game, so let’s go!” signifies the method Li wants his students to adapt to this mindset in order to learn English in his way. The “Crazy” in Crazy English signifies Li Yang&#x27;s want for students to have rage and passion in their studies and to fulfill their dreams by giving up their fear of failing.

== Advantages ==
Crazy English encourages students to shout out English words whether behind buildings, on rooftops, or at organized rallies. Shouting together with others helps people overcome their shyness, because if everyone is doing it nobody is embarrassed. In traditional Chinese hierarchies, youths are not encouraged to show a mastery of skills that surpass the skills of their adult counterparts. Li Yang&#x27;s proponents argue that his method of teaching may help Chinese students get over their inhibitions to learning and practicing English. Li believes that most Chinese are brought up with modesty and a lack of confidence—that they are afraid of losing face in front of family, friends, educators, and even strangers. Common English teaching methods in China reflect this fear of failure and accommodate students by allowing them to learn English without practicing speaking, preparing dialogues, or giving individual oral presentations.

== Disadvantages ==
However, an opposer of Crazy English notes that Li Yang only says English words without giving any further details about the context in how, when, where, and what condition does one word should and could be applied. Another opposer comments that Li does not spend effort on structuring any cohesion between vocabulary or sentences; he assumes that students get enough of that in the classroom. Instead, he uses “crazy” sentences shouted at high decibels and funny hand movements to engage his audience in participation. In additional challenger also notes that students rarely – if ever – are presented with a situation in which they need just to parrot a native speaker. Another argues that because of Crazy English many students have come to believe that English has no standards which results in their English not sounding American or British.

== Controversies ==
In 1996 Yang&#x27;s method became popular in Guangdong province against the will of the local English teachers. To counter, the local government prohibited Yang from giving seminars in the area for six months. Chengdu, Sichuan also banned Li from teaching for an extended span of time. Critics of Crazy English say that the promotion of Crazy English over the past 15 years has resulted in most students believing English has no standard, and that some even mistake American English for the standard one, which has made most students in China after 16 years of studying English sound neither British nor American. As a result, many are so confused with the two different kinds of English accents that they choose to keep their mouths shut. Critics also describe Crazy English as a technique only appropriate for certain situations — for example, a taxi driver who needs only a few sentences to communicate with English-speaking customers — but not as the main method to teaching students in a classroom setting. Critics note that although Li advocates fluency in pronunciation, his dismissal of fluency in content is slightly problematic.

<text>A stun grenade, also known as a flash grenade, flashbang, thunderflash, or sound bomb, is a non-lethal explosive device used to temporarily disorient an enemy&#x27;s senses. Upon detonation, a stun grenade produces a blinding flash of light and an extremely loud &quot;bang&quot;. They are often used in close-quarters combat, door breaching, and riot control, typically to stun enemies or distract them.

Originally developed to simulate explosions during military training, stun grenades were first used by the British Army Special Air Service&#x27;s counterterrorist wing in the late 1970s, and have been used by police and military forces worldwide since.

Despite their less-lethal nature, stun grenades are still capable of causing harm, and can injure or kill when detonating in close proximity. They are also capable of sparking fires.

== Effects ==
Stun grenades are designed to produce a blinding flash of light of around 7 megacandela (Mcd) and an intensely loud &quot;bang&quot; of greater than 170 decibels (dB).

== Construction ==
Unlike a fragmentation grenade, stun grenades are constructed with a casing designed to remain intact during detonation and avoid fragmentation injuries, while having large circular cutouts to allow the light and sound of the explosion through. The filler comprises a pyrotechnic metal-oxidant mix of magnesium or aluminium and an oxidizer such as potassium perchlorate or potassium nitrate.

== Hazards ==
While stun grenades are designed to limit injury, permanent hearing loss has been reported. The concussive blast has the ability to cause injuries, and the heat generated may ignite flammable materials. The fires that occurred during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege in London were caused by stun grenades.

<doc id="662808" wikidata="Q2143591" url="?curid=662808" title="Snooker world rankings">
<text>The snooker world rankings are the official system of ranking professional snooker players to determine automatic qualification and seeding for tournaments on the World Snooker Tour. First introduced in the 1976–77 season, world rankings are maintained by the sport&#x27;s governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. Each player&#x27;s world ranking is based on their performances in designated ranking tournaments over the preceding two years. Until the 2009–10 season, rankings were updated once annually, following the World Snooker Championship. Since the 2010–11 season, rankings have been updated after every ranking tournament. The world rankings were formerly based on point tariffs set by the governing body, but this system transitioned to a prize money list for the 2014–15 season.

== Background ==
The rankings determine the seedings for tournaments on the World Snooker Tour, organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), and who gets an invite to prestigious invitational events. Tournaments open to the membership are often played in two stages—a qualification stage and the &quot;venue stage&quot;—usually at different locations. In tournaments with a &quot;tiered&quot; format players come into events in different rounds based on their ranking, and in some cases the top players in the sport are seeded through to the venue stage and do not have to play a qualification match. In particular, the top 16 ranked players automatically qualify for the final stages of the World Championship and the Masters, so as well as interest in who will be number one, there is typically a lot of interest in which players are likely to maintain or acquire &quot;top 16 status&quot;. Players are awarded ranking points according to the round they reach in ranking tournaments—specially designated tournaments that carry ranking status. Every professional member of the WPBSA is assigned a ranking, whether they are active on the circuit or not.

== System ==
Prior to the introduction of the world rankings, the previous year&#x27;s winner and runner-up were allocated the top seedings in the World Championship, held annually. As more tournaments were added to the calendar and more players joined the circuit in the 1970s, it became increasingly necessary to seed the tournaments, precipitating the &quot;Order of Merit&quot; for the 1975–76 season. The system was very basic, with seedings based on the results of the last three World Championships, and rankings were formally introduced in 1976 after the World Championship for the 1976–77 season using the same criteria. By the 1982–83 season many more tournaments were being contested, and it seemed reasonable to take those results into consideration too. The Professional Players Tournament and International Open were awarded ranking status, working on the same system; the Classic carried ranking points from the 1983–84 season, the UK Championship and British Open from 1984–85. The revised system was now based on only the two previous seasons, and updated annually after the World Championship. While the ranking point allocations have undergone modifications down the years the basic system remained the same up until the 2009–10 season. For the 2010–11 season, the system was revised to incorporate ranking updates after every tournament—instead of once a season—in an effort to make the rankings more reflective of current form. The current system utilises a two-year &quot;rolling&quot; format where points from tournaments in the current season replace the points from corresponding tournaments of two seasons ago.

== Seedings ==
The seedings for tournaments change from tournament to tournament: the defending champion is allocated the top seed followed by the reigning world champion and the remaining seeds are taken from a &quot;seeding list&quot;. When the official rankings were only calculated once a year the seedings for tournaments—with the exception of the top two seeds—followed the official rankings. Players and pundits closely tracked the ranking points earned during a season; the &quot;provisional rankings&quot; (which had no official status in the game) were the rankings based on the ranking points accumulated in the previous season, combined with those accumulated thus far in the current season, and as the season progressed they converged on the official rankings for the following season. The provisional rankings gave an indication of a player&#x27;s form, and as the season approached its dénouement, the provisional rankings would become a source of tension as the battle for the number one spot, top 16 places, and tour qualification intensified. The introduction of the rolling rankings in 2010 facilitated updates to the seeding list throughout the season. Various &quot;cut-off&quot; points are selected at convenient stages during the season where the rankings are &quot;frozen&quot; and used as seedings for the next few tournaments, until the next revision.

== Tariffs ==
The original &quot;Order of Merit&quot;, created for the 1975–76 season and based on just World Championship results, awarded the winner five points, the runner-up four, semi-finalists three, and so on down to one point for players who lost in the last 16. The world rankings, introduced in the following year, used the same allocation. Subsequent tournaments that were assigned ranking status worked on the same system but with the World Championship from 1983 onwards carrying double points. The ranking point allocation was later revised slightly with winners of all bar the World Championship now receiving six points, runners-up five, down to one point for the last 32; the World Championship more or less stayed as it was with ten points for the winner, incrementally reduced by two points for each preceding round, but now awarded one point for the last 32 in line with the other tournaments. In addition to ranking points, merit and frame points were also awarded which were used as a tie-break when players were on equal ranking points. When the game went open for the 1991–92 season, the ranking point allocations (devised by the WPBSA chairman on the back of a cigarette pack) were altered by several factors to accommodate the influx of new players. The tie-break system was dropped but the system remained basically the same with players awarded incrementally more points for each successive round; should a seeded player lose their first match they would receive only half the points allocated to the non-seeded losers in that round. The World Championship continued to award more points than the other events but under the &quot;open era&quot; system the allocations often varied between other events too, with the UK Championship traditionally having the second-highest tariff. The ranking point schedule was replaced by a prize money list for the 2014–15 season, with prize money earnings in events carrying ranking status contributing to a players ranking.

<doc id="662811" wikidata="Q655017" url="?curid=662811" title="German–Soviet population transfers">
<text>The German–Soviet population transfers were population transfers of ethnic Germans, ethnic Poles, and some ethnic East Slavs that took place from 1939 to 1941. These transfers were part of the German &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; policy in accordance with the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

== Conception ==
As a result of Nazi Germany&#x27;s expansion, most German speakers in Europe were brought under one regime.

There were millions of ethnic Germans living outside German borders, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, with the majority of people being migrants in Russia. The migrated Germansreferred to as &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;had lived outside of Germany for centuries. These emigrants had settled in the lands east of Germany between the 12th and 18th centuries.

Adolf Hitler had a plan to attract these German-speaking people into Nazi Germany. However, he also believed that the 1937 borders and territories of Nazi Germany, i.e. before the &quot;Anschluss&quot; (annexation) of Austria and the Sudetenland, were inadequate to accommodate this large increase in population.

At this time, propaganda for more &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, or living space, grew fast.

== Legal basis ==
With the largest number of ethnic Germans living in Russia, Hitler knew that he could not resettle all these people without the full cooperation of Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union. In late August 1939 (a week before the invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in Europe), Hitler sent his foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to Moscow to arrange a pact of non-aggression with the Soviet Union. This became known as the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Hitler&#x27;s aim was to avoid having to fight on two fronts upon the invasion of Poland and best facilitate its successful capture by partition, a crucial matter in the first weeks of the Second World War.

The real issues agreed upon in the pact were the partition of territories in Central and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence and the reciprocal transfer of ethnic German and Russian people to their native countries.

Hitler&#x27;s plan was to invade western Poland (having assigned the eastern part to the Soviet Union in the pact) and then force all non-German people (mostly Polish citizens) out of their homes and either use them for forced labour or move them to the General Government area. Once these territories were free of non-Germans, the population transfers could begin with ethnic Germans settling in the homes of the expropriated Polish.

== Population transfers 1939–1944 ==
The planned transfers were first announced to the ethnic Germans and the general public in October 1939.

The Nazis set out to encourage the return of the ethnic Germans (called &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; by the Nazis), from the Baltic States by the use of propaganda. This included using scare tactics about the Soviet Union and led to tens of thousands of Germans leaving. Those who left were not referred to as refugees, but were rather described as &quot;answering the call of the Führer&quot;. To encourage support of this program, later German propaganda films such as &quot;The Red Terror&quot; and &quot;Frisians in Peril&quot; depicted the ethnic Germans as deeply persecuted in their native lands.

Families were transported by sea from the Baltic States and by train from other territories. The German government arranged for the transfer of their furniture and personal belongings. All immovable property was sold, with the money being collected by the Nazis and not given back to the families. This was an intentional act designed to disconnect the displaced people from their former homeland. The value of the real estate left behind was to be compensated in cash and Polish property in occupied Poland.

The transported ethnic Germans were initially kept in camps for racial evaluation, to prevent intermixing with the native German population. There they were divided into groups: A (&quot;Altreich&quot;), who were to be settled in Germany and allowed no farms or businesses (to allow for closer watch), S (&quot;Sonderfall&quot;), who were used as forced, and unpaid workers, and O (&quot;Ost-Fälle&quot;), the best classification, to be settled in the &#x27;Eastern Wall&#x27;—the occupied regions to protect Germans from the East—and allowed independence. This last group, after spending some time in refugee camps in Germany, were eventually brought to Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany and to Zamość County, as decided by the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;. The deportation orders required that enough Polish people be removed to provide space for every settler, e.g. if twenty Nazi, German bakers were sent, twenty Polish bakers were removed. The settlers were often given Polish homes where the families had been evicted so quickly that half-eaten meals remained on the tables and small children had been taken from unmade beds. Members of the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls were assigned the task of overseeing these evictions to ensure that the Polish left behind most of their belongings for the use of the settlers. Once they were settled, the process of Germanization was begun.

Ethnic Germans were evacuated from territories occupied by the Soviets in 1940, notably Bessarabia and the Baltic States of Estonia and Latvia, all of which traditionally had large ethnic German minorities. However, the majority of the Baltic Germans had already been resettled in late 1939, prior to the occupation of Estonia and Latvia by the Soviets in June 1940. In most cases, they were given farms taken from 110,000 Polish who were expelled from the area.

Reichling&#x27;s figures do not include parts of the more than 200,000 ethnic Germans from Yugoslavia who fled in the autumn of 1944 and who were directed into the General Government. It is not known how many actually arrived there.

<text>Highway 99A is a series of former highways in the southwestern part of British Columbia, Canada. It was the designation of the former 1942 alignment of Highway 99 as well a various alternate routes which existed in the 1950s and 1960s. The last official use of &#x27;99A&#x27; was decommissioned in 2006, although some present-day, commercially published road maps (such as Google Maps) still show it and some remnant signage still remains. Some brand new 99A signs can be seen as well as of 2023.

==King George Highway / Kingsway==
Highway 99A was long highway within Greater Vancouver and followed the original Highway 99 alignment between the Peace Arch Border Crossing and Downtown Vancouver and was designated in 1973 when the Deas (Island) Throughway was renamed Highway 99. Prior to that, the four-lane, divided &quot;Deas (Island) Throughway&quot; which was completed to the U.S. border in 1962, was designated Highway 499. Highway 99A was decommissioned by the province in 2006 and the city of Surrey renamed &quot;King George Highway&quot; to &quot;King George Boulevard&quot; in 2009, although, as of July 2021, the Ministry of Transportation keeps two minor segments of the former route maintained in its inventory.

=== Route description ===

Highway 99A started in Surrey at the first exit off Highway 99 north of the Peace Arch and followed the King George Highway. Originally to be named the &quot;Peace Arch Highway&quot;, it was dedicated officially on October 16, 1940 as the King George VI Highway after the royal visit of 1939. The highway served as a route for commuters travelling to New Westminster, Burnaby, and Vancouver. The highway goes north for to an interchange with Highway 99, and from there, another to its junction with Highway 10. The highway continued north for another to Fraser Highway, where it merged with Highway 1A. Highways 1A and 99A continued northwest for to the Pattullo Bridge over the Fraser River, crossing from Surrey into New Westminster.

In New Westminster, Highway 99A followed McBride Boulevard and 10th Avenue, then onto Kingsway, where the highway entered Burnaby. Highway 99A then proceeded west-northwest for through the City of Burnaby to its intersection with Boundary Road, at which point the highway crossed into Vancouver. In Vancouver, Highway 99A continued on Kingsway northwest for , then onto Main Street. Highway 99A followed Main Street north for , then west onto the Dunsmuir Viaduct and Dunsmuir Street into the downtown core of the city to Burrard Street, where it reunited with Highway 99 on Georgia Street; southbound traffic followed Georgia Street to Main Street.

;Footnotes
==Pacific Highway==
Between 1942 and 1962, the &quot;King George Highway&quot; was designated Highway 99, while the Highway 99A designation was given to the older Pacific Highway after it became the alternate U.S. border route. The highway began at the Pacific Highway Border Crossing near the locality of Douglas (now part of Surrey) and continued north to Cloverdale, where it shared the alignment with the Highway 1 (present-day Fraser Highway) to the King George Highway (Highway 99). In 1958, the Pacific Highway was redesignated as Highway 15.

==Grandview Highway==
Between 1942 and 1962, the Grandview Highway was designated as Highway 99A, serving as an alternate route to Kingsway between Pattullo Bridge and Vancouver. From the bridge in New Westminster, Highway 99A followed McBride Boulevard and 8th Avenue to 8th Street (at the time, Highway 1/99 followed Columbia Street and 12th Street though downtown New Westminster to Kingsway). After crossing 10th Avenue, Highway 99A entered into Burnaby and become &quot;Grandview Highway&quot; (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Douglas-Grandview Highway&quot; as it was known as &quot;Douglas Road&quot; prior to 1926). At Boundary Road, Grandview Highway turned north for a few blocks before turning west and entering Vancouver, where it travelled in a west-northwest direction along Grandview Highway North to Clark Drive, where Highway 99A followed Clark Drive to the Grandview Viaduct and Terminal Avenue, rejoining Highway 1/99 at Main Street near the Pacific Central Station.

Highway 401 was constructed to the north of Grandview Highway and opened in 1964, replacing Highway 99A as a regional east-west highway, and the route was reverted to the respective local municipalities. In 1968, the Douglas-Grandview Highway was renamed &quot;Canada Way&quot; in honour of the Canadian Centennial which was a year earlier. Vancouver also later prioritized Grandview Highway to follow Grandview Highway South and connect with 12th Avenue, while Grandview Highway North experienced a series of traffic calming measures, which includes carrying a portion of the SkyTrain&#x27;s Expo Line and later conversion to a greenway and bikeway.

<doc id="662827" wikidata="Q330604" url="?curid=662827" title="William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford">
<text>William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford, (23 June 1865 – 8 June 1932), known as Sir William Joynson-Hicks, Bt, from 1919 to 1929 and popularly known as Jix, was an English solicitor and Conservative Party politician.

He first attracted attention in 1908 when he defeated Winston Churchill, a Liberal Cabinet Minister at the time, in a by-election for the seat of North-West Manchester but is best known as a long-serving and controversial Home Secretary in Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s Second Government from 1924 to 1929. He gained a reputation for pious authoritarianism, opposing Communism and clamping down on nightclubs and what he saw as indecent literature. He also played an important role in the fight against the introduction of the Church of England Revised Prayer Book, and in lowering the voting age for women from 30 to 21.

==Early life and career==
===Background and early life===
William Hicks, as he was initially called, was born in Canonbury, London on 23 June 1865. He was the eldest of four sons and two daughters of Henry Hicks, of Plaistow Hall, Kent, and his wife Harriett, daughter of William Watts. Hicks was a prosperous merchant and senior evangelical Anglican layman who demanded the very best from his children.

William Hicks was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London (1875–81). He &quot;took the pledge&quot; (to abstain from alcohol) at the age of 14 and kept it all his life.

====Marriage====
In 1894 while on holiday, he met Grace Lynn Joynson, daughter of a silk manufacturer. Her father was also a Manchester evangelical Tory. They were married on 12 June 1895. In 1896 he added his wife&#x27;s name &quot;Joynson&quot; to his surname.

====Joynson Hicks====
After leaving school, Hicks was articled to a London solicitor between 1881 and 1887, before setting up his own practice in 1888. Initially he struggled to attract clients, but he was helped by his father&#x27;s position as a leading member of the City Common Council and as Deputy Chairman of the London General Omnibus Company, for whom he did a great deal of claims work. His law firm was still operating as late as 1989, when a guide to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 was published as &quot;Joynson-Hicks on UK Copyright&quot;.

In 1989, Joynson-Hicks merged with Taylor Garrett to form Taylor Joynson Garrett which itself merged with German law firm Wessing &amp; Berenberg-Gossler to form Taylor Wessing in 2002.

===Early attempts to enter Parliament===
He joined the Conservative Party (at that time part of the Unionist coalition with the Liberal Unionists, which name it retained until 1925) and was selected as a Conservative Parliamentary candidate in 1898. He unsuccessfully contested seats in Manchester in the general elections of 1900 and 1906, losing to Winston Churchill on the latter occasion. On the latter occasion, he made anti-semitic speeches. At the time, there was an influx of Russian Jews fleeing from pogroms, which had caused Arthur Balfour&#x27;s government to pass the Aliens Act 1905. In the 1906 election Joynson-Hicks advocated reform of workhouses and pensions for &quot;the veteran of labour&quot; but not for &quot;the scallywag&quot; (Churchill downplayed the idea that a Liberal government could set up a &quot;mechanical&quot; system of old age pensions, although it would eventually do so in 1908). Joynson-Hicks also claimed that a Liberal Government, under the influence of Lloyd George, might disestablish the Church of England. Liberal posters in the constituency praised &quot;Churchill and Free Trade&quot;, &quot;Cheap Food&quot; and &quot;A United Empire&quot;. Churchill won by 1241 votes, a large majority for the time.

===Motoring expert===
Joynson-Hicks was an early authority on transport law, particularly motoring law. In 1906 he published &quot;The Law of Heavy and Light Mechanical Traction on Highways&quot;. He was beginning to acquire a reputation as an evangelical lawyer with a perhaps paradoxical interest in the latest technology: motor cars (of which he owned several), telephones and aircraft.

In 1907 he became Chairman of the Motor Union, and presided over the merger with The Automobile Association in 1911, serving as chairman of the merged body until 1922. One of his first actions was to assert the legality of AA patrols warning motorists of police speed traps.

He was also President of the Lancashire Commercial Motor Users&#x27; Association of the National Threshing machine Owners&#x27; Association, and of the National Traction engine Association.

He was also Treasurer of the Zenana Bible and Medical Mission and a member of the finance committee of the YMCA.

==1908 by-election==
Joynson-Hicks was elected to Parliament in a by-election in 1908, when Winston Churchill was obliged to submit to re-election in Manchester North West after his appointment as President of the Board of Trade, as the Ministers of the Crown Act 1908 required newly appointed Cabinet ministers to re-contest their seats. Cabinet ministers were normally returned unopposed, but as Churchill had crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberals in 1904, the Conservatives were disinclined to allow him an uncontested return.

Ronald Blythe in &quot;The Salutary Tale of Jix&quot; in &quot;The Age of Illusion&quot; (1963) called it &quot;the most brilliant, entertaining and hilarious electoral fight of the century&quot;. Joynson-Hicks&#x27; nickname &quot;Jix&quot; dates from this by-election. The election was notable for both the attacks of the Suffragette movement on Churchill, over his refusal to support legislation that would give women the vote, and Jewish hostility to Joynson-Hicks over his support for the controversial Aliens Act which aimed to restrict Jewish immigration.

Joynson-Hicks called Labour leader Keir Hardie &quot;a leprous traitor&quot; who wanted to sweep away the Ten Commandments. This prompted H. G. Wells to send an open letter to Labour sympathisers in Manchester, saying Joynson-Hicks &quot;represents absolutely the worst element in British political life … an entirely undistinguished man … and an obscure and ineffectual nobody.&quot; Wells had endorsed Churchill, who admired his books and with whom he was in regular correspondence, as a potential social reformer.

Joynson-Hicks defeated Churchill by 429 votes. This provoked a strong reaction across the country with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; running the front-page headline &quot;Winston Churchill is OUT! OUT! OUT!&quot; (Churchill shortly returned to Parliament as MP for Dundee).

Joynson-Hicks gained personal notoriety in the immediate aftermath of this election for an address to his Jewish hosts at a dinner given by the Maccabean Society, during which he said &quot;he had beaten them all thoroughly and soundly and was no longer their servant.&quot; Subsequent allegations that he was personally anti-Semitic formed an important strand of the authoritarian streak that many, including recent scholars David Cesarani and Geoffrey Alderman, detected in his speeches and behaviour. Cesarani cautioned that &quot;although he may have been nicknamed &#x27;Mussolini Minor&#x27;, Jix was no fascist.&quot; Other work has disputed the notion that Joynson-Hicks was an anti-Semite, most notably a major article by W. D. Rubinstein which asserted that as Home Secretary Joynson-Hicks would later allow more Jews to be naturalised than any other holder of that office. Whether or not it was justified, the notion that Joynson-Hicks was an anti-Semite played a large part in his portrayal as a narrow-minded and intolerant man, most obviously in the work of Ronald Blythe.

==Early Parliamentary career==
Joynson-Hicks lost his seat in the January 1910 general election. He contested Sunderland in the second general election in December that year, but was again defeated. He was returned unopposed for Brentford at a by-election in March 1911.

During World War I, he formed a Pals battalion within the Middlesex Regiment, the &quot;Football Battalion.&quot; He acquired a reputation as a well-informed backbencher, an expert on aircraft and motors, badgering ministers about matters of aircraft design and production and methods of attacking Zeppelins. On 12 May 1915, he presented a petition to the Commons demanding the internment of enemy aliens of military age and the withdrawal from coastal areas of all enemy aliens. In 1916 he published a pamphlet &quot;The Command of the Air&quot; in which he advocated indiscriminate bombing of civilians in German cities, including Berlin. However, he was not offered a government post.

In 1918, his old constituency having been abolished, he became MP for Twickenham, holding the seat until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1929.

For his war work, he was created a Baronet, of Holmbury in the County of Surrey, in 1919.

==The Lloyd George Coalition==
In 1919-20 he went on an extended visit to the Sudan and India, which changed his political fortunes. At the time, there was considerable unrest in India and a rapid growth in the Home Rule movement, something Joynson-Hicks opposed due to the great economic importance of the Indian Empire to Britain. He at one time had commented &quot;I know it is frequently said at missionary meetings that we conquered India to raise the level of the Indians. That is cant. We hold it as the finest outlet for British goods in general, and for Lancashire cotton goods in particular.&quot;

He emerged as a strong supporter of General Reginald Dyer over the Amritsar Massacre, and nearly forced the resignation of the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, over the motion of censure the government put down concerning Dyer&#x27;s actions. This episode established his reputation as one of the &quot;die-hards&quot; on the right-wing of the party, and he emerged as a strong critic of the party&#x27;s participation in a coalition government with the Liberal David Lloyd George.

As part of this campaign, he led an abortive attempt to block Austen Chamberlain&#x27;s nomination as leader of the Unionist party on Bonar Law&#x27;s retirement, putting forward Lord Birkenhead instead with the express aim of &quot;splitting the coalition&quot;.

==Entering government==
Joynson-Hicks played a small role in the fall of the Lloyd George Coalition, which he had so disliked, in October 1922. The refusal of many leading Conservatives, who had been supporters of the Coalition, to serve in Bonar Law&#x27;s new government opened up promotion prospects. Joynson-Hicks was appointed Secretary for Overseas Trade (a junior minister, effectively deputy to the President of the Board of Trade). In the fifteen-month Conservative administration of first Bonar Law and then Stanley Baldwin, Joynson-Hicks was rapidly promoted. In March 1923, he became Paymaster General then Postmaster General, filling positions left vacant by the promotion of Neville Chamberlain.

When Stanley Baldwin became Prime Minister in May 1923, he initially also retained his previous position of Chancellor of the Exchequer while searching for a permanent successor. To relieve the burden of this position, he promoted Joynson-Hicks to Financial Secretary to the Treasury and included him in the Cabinet.

In that role, Joynson-Hicks was responsible for making the &quot;Hansard&quot; statement, on 19 July 1923, that the Inland Revenue would not prosecute a defaulting taxpayer who made a full confession and paid the outstanding tax, interest and penalties. Joynson-Hicks had hopes of eventually becoming Chancellor himself, but instead Neville Chamberlain was appointed to the post in August 1923. Once more, Joynson-Hicks filled the gap left by Chamberlain&#x27;s promotion, serving as Minister of Health. He became a Privy Counsellor in 1923.

Following the hung parliament, amounting to a Unionist defeat in the general election of December 1923, Joynson-Hicks became a key figure in various intra-party attempts to oust Baldwin. At one time, the possibility of his becoming leader himself was discussed, but it seems to have been quickly discarded. He was involved in a plot to persuade Arthur Balfour that should the King seek his advice on whom to appoint Prime Minister, Balfour would advise him to appoint Austen Chamberlain or Lord Derby Prime Minister instead of Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald. The plot failed when Balfour refused to countenance such a move and the Liberals publicly announced they would support MacDonald, causing the government to fall in January 1924. MacDonald then became the first Labour Prime Minister.

==Home Secretary==
The Conservatives returned to power in November 1924 and Joynson-Hicks was appointed as Home Secretary. Francis Thompson described him as &quot;the most prudish, puritanical and protestant Home Secretary of the twentieth century&quot;. Promotion appears to have gone to his head somewhat and he allowed himself to be touted as a prospective party leader, a possibility which Leo Amery dismissed as &quot;amazing&quot; (October 1925). In his role as Home Secretary he was in attendance at the birth of Queen Elizabeth II in April 1926.

===Public morals===
Joynson-Hicks was portrayed as a reactionary for his attempts to crack down on night clubs and other aspects of the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;. He was also heavily implicated in the banning of Radclyffe Hall&#x27;s lesbian novel, &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; (1928), in which he took a personal interest.

He wanted to stem what he called &quot;the flood of filth coming across the Channel&quot;. He clamped down on the work of D. H. Lawrence (he helped to force the publication of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; in an expurgated version), as well as on books on birth control and the translation of &quot;The Decameron&quot;. He ordered the raiding of nightclubs, where a great deal of after-hours drinking took place, with many members of fashionable society being arrested. The nightclub owner Kate Meyrick, proprietor of The 43 Club amongst other venues, was in and out of prison five times, her release parties being causes for big champagne celebrations. He instructed the head of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police, William Horwood that &#x27;it is a place of the most intense mischief and immorality [with] doped women and drunken men. I want you to put this matter in the hands of your most experienced men and whatever the cost will be, find out the truth about this club and if it is as bad as I am informed prosecute it with the utmost rigour of the law&#x27;.

All of this was satirised in A.P. Herbert&#x27;s one act play &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Soho&quot; (1927).

===General Strike and subversion===
In 1925, he ordered a show trial of Harry Pollitt and a dozen other leading communists, using the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797. During the General Strike of 1926, he was a leading organiser of the systems that maintained supplies and law and order, although there is some evidence that left to himself he would have pursued a more hawkish policy – most notably, his repeated appeals for more volunteer constables and his attempt to close down the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.

Having been a hardliner during the General Strike he remained a staunch anti-communist thereafter, although the left appear to have warmed a little to him over the Prayer Book controversy. Against the wishes of Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain he ordered a police raid on the Soviet trade agency ARCOS in 1927, apparently actually hoping to rupture Anglo-Soviet relations. He was popular with the police and on his retirement a portrait of him was erected in Scotland Yard, paid for by police subscription.

===Prayer Book Crisis===
In 1927 Joynson-Hicks turned his fire on the proposed revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. The law required Parliament to approve such revisions, normally regarded as a formality. Joynson-Hicks had been President of the evangelical National Church League since 1921, and he went against Baldwin&#x27;s wishes in opposing the Revised Prayer Book.

When the Prayer Book came before the House of Commons Joynson-Hicks argued strongly against its adoption as he felt it strayed far from the Protestant principles of the Church of England. He likened the Revised Prayer Book to &quot;papistry&quot;, as he believed that the reservation of sacrament implied a belief in transubstantiation. The debate on the Prayer Book is regarded as one of the most eloquent ever seen in the Commons, and resulted in the rejection of the revised Prayer Book in 1927. His allies were an alliance of ultra-Protestant Tories and nonconformist Liberals and Labour, and some of them likened him to John Hampden or Oliver Cromwell. It was said that no such occasion had been seen since the anti-Catholic agitation of 1850-1 or, some said, since the late seventeenth century crises over Exclusion or Titus Oates.

A further revised version (the &quot;Deposited Book&quot;) was submitted in 1928 but rejected again.

Many leading Church of England figures came to feel that disestablishment would become necessary to guard the Church against this sort of political interference. Joynson-Hicks&#x27; book &quot;The Prayer Book Crisis&quot;, published in May 1928, correctly forecast that the bishops would back off from demanding disestablishment, for fear of losing their state-provided salaries and endowments. However, the National Assembly of the Church of England then declared an emergency, and this was argued as a pretext for the use of the 1928 Prayer Book in many churches for decades afterwards, an act of questionable legality.

===Votes for young women===
Off the cuff and without Cabinet discussion, in a debate on a private member&#x27;s bill on 20 February 1925, Joynson-Hicks pledged equal voting rights for women (clarifying a pronouncement of Baldwin&#x27;s in the 1924 General Election).

Joynson-Hicks&#x27; 1933 biographer wrote that the claim that Joynson-Hicks&#x27; parliamentary pledge to Lady Astor in 1925 had committed the party to giving votes to young women was an invention of Winston Churchill that has entered popular mythology but has no basis in fact. However, Francis Thompson (2004) wrote that the Baldwin Government would probably not have taken action without Joynson-Hicks&#x27; pledge.

Joynson-Hicks personally moved the Second Reading of the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 and was also responsible for piloting it through Parliament. He made a strong speech in support of the Bill, which lowered the voting age for women from 30 to 21 (the same age as men at the time), and which was blamed in part for the Conservatives&#x27; unexpected electoral defeat the following year, which the right of the party attributed to newly enfranchised young women (referred to derogatorily as &quot;flappers&quot;) voting for the opposition Labour party.

===Reforms===
Throughout his tenure at the Home Office, Joynson-Hicks was involved in the reform of the penal system – in particular, the Borstals and the introduction of a legal requirement for all courts to have a probation officer. He made a point of visiting all the prisons in the country, and was often dismayed by what he found there. He made a concerted effort to improve the conditions of the prisons under his jurisdiction, and earned a compliment from persistent offender and night-club owner Kate Meyrick, who noted in her memoirs that prisons had improved considerably thanks to his efforts.

Joynson-Hicks sided with Churchill over the General Strike and India, but parted company with him on the topic of greyhound racing, which Joynson-Hicks believed served a useful social function in getting poor people out of the pubs. He also thought that Churchill&#x27;s view that totalisers were permissible for horse-racing but not for greyhounds smacked of one law for the rich and another for the poor.

He became something of a hero to shop workers because of the Shops (Hours of Closing) Act 1928, which banned working after 8pm and required employers to grant a half day holiday each week. He also repealed a regulation to allow chocolates to be sold in the &quot;first&quot; interval of theatre performances as well as the second.

In August 1928, Lord Beaverbrook thought Joynson-Hicks the only possible successor to Baldwin. However, he was a figure of fun to many of the public and most of his colleagues thought the idea of him as Prime Minister, in F. M. L. Thompson&#x27;s view, &quot;ridiculous&quot;. He was praised in the popular press and ridiculed in the upmarket weeklies. He insisted that he did not favour full censorship, and in his 1929 pamphlet &quot;Do We Need A Censor?&quot; he recorded that he had ordered the police to stamp out indecency in Hyde Park so that it would be safe for &quot;a man to take his daughter for a walk&quot; there.

Joynson-Hicks was concerned at the electoral popularity of Lloyd George&#x27;s plan to cut unemployment through public works, as contained in the pamphlet &quot;We Can Conquer Unemployment&quot; and the Orange Book. He wrote to Churchill, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, on 6 February 1929, enclosing a memorandum proposing a programme of public works financed by a government loan. Churchill poured cold water on the idea.

==Later career==
As the time for a new general election loomed, Baldwin contemplated reshuffling his Cabinet to move Churchill from the Exchequer to the India Office, and asking all ministers older than himself (Baldwin was born in 1867) to step down, with the exception of Sir Austen Chamberlain. Joynson-Hicks would have been one of those asked to retire from the Cabinet if the Conservatives had been re-elected.

The Conservatives unexpectedly lost power at the general election in May 1929. A month after the election Joynson-Hicks was raised to the peerage as the Viscount Brentford, of Newick in the County of Sussex in the Dissolution Honours (necessitating a by-election at which the Conservatives narrowly held his old seat).

Lord Brentford remained a senior figure in the Conservative Party, but due to his declining health he was not invited to join the National Government at its formation in August 1931. As late as October 1931 Lord Beaverbrook urged him to set up a Conservative Shadow Cabinet, as an alternative to the National Government. The National Government was reconstructed in November 1931, but again he was not offered a return to office.

Lord Brentford married Grace Lynn, only daughter of Richard Hampson Joynson, JP, of Bowdon Cheshire, on 12 June 1895 in St. Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster. They had two sons and one daughter.

Joynson-Hicks died at Newick Park, Sussex, on 8 June 1932, aged 66. His wealth at death was £67,661 5s 7d (around £4m at 2016 prices).

His widow the Viscountess Brentford died in January 1952. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard. His youngest son, the Hon. Lancelot (who succeeded in the viscountcy in 1958), was also a Conservative politician.

==Reputation==
Joynson-Hicks&#x27; Victorian top hat and frock coat made him seem an old-fashioned figure, but he came to be regarded with a certain affection by the public. William Bridgeman, his predecessor as Home Secretary, wrote of him &quot;There is something of the comedian in him, which is not intentional but inevitably apparent, which makes it hard to take him as seriously as one might&quot;. Churchill wrote of him &quot;The worst that can be said about him is that he runs the risk of being most humorous when he wishes to be most serious&quot;. After his death Leo Amery wrote that &quot;he was a very likeable fellow&quot; whilst Stanley Baldwin observed &quot;he may have said many foolish things but he rarely did one&quot;.

Although Joynson-Hicks was Home Secretary, a notoriously difficult office to hold, for some four and a half years, he is frequently overlooked by both historians and politicians. His length of tenure was exceeded in the twentieth century only by Chuter Ede, R. A. Butler and Herbert Morrison, yet he was not included in a list of long-serving Home Secretaries presented to Jack Straw in 2001 on his departure from the Home Office. He is also virtually the only major politician of the 1920s not to have been accorded a recent biography.

For many years detailed discussion of Joynson-Hicks&#x27; life and career was hampered by the inaccessibility of his papers, which were kept by the Brentford family. This meant the discourse on his life was shaped by the official biography of 1933 by H. A. Taylor, and by material published by his contemporaries – much of it published by people who hated him. As a result, public discourse has been shaped by material that portrayed him in an unflattering light, such as Ronald Blythe&#x27;s biographical chapter in &quot;The Age of Illusion.&quot;

In the 1990s the current Viscount lent his grandfather&#x27;s papers to an MPhil student at the University of Westminster, Jonathon Hopkins, who prepared a catalogue of them and wrote a short biography of Joynson-Hicks as part of his thesis. In 2007, a number of these papers were deposited with the East Sussex Record Office in Lewes (which transferred to The Keep in Brighton in 2013) where they are available to the public. Huw Clayton, whose PhD thesis concerned Joynson-Hicks&#x27; moral policies at the Home Office, has announced that he plans to write a new biography of Joynson-Hicks with the aid of these sources. An article on Joynson-Hicks, written by Clayton, has since appeared in the &quot;Journal of Historical Biography&quot;.

In 2023, historian Max Hastings wrote a Times article suggesting that those who consider some current Tory ministers and ex-ministers to be the &quot;worst ever&quot; to revisit Joynson-Hicks&#x27; career and perhaps conclude that &quot;more than a few of our past politicians make the present ones look ... not as awful as Jix&quot;.

<doc id="662828" wikidata="Q2503747" url="?curid=662828" title="And you are lynching Negroes">
<text>&quot;And you are lynching Negroes&quot; (; which also means &quot;Yet, in your [country], [they] lynch Negroes&quot;) is a catchphrase that describes or satirizes Soviet responses to US criticisms of Soviet human rights violations.

The Soviet media frequently covered racial discrimination, financial crises, and unemployment in the United States, which were identified as failings of the capitalist system that had been supposedly erased by state socialism. Lynchings of African Americans were brought up as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used as a form of rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of US policy.

Former Czech president and writer Václav Havel placed the phrase among &quot;commonly canonized demagogical tricks&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; described it as a form of whataboutism that became ubiquitous after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The book &quot;Exit from Communism&quot; by author Stephen Richards Graubard wrote that it symbolized a divorce from reality.

Author Michael Dobson compared it to the idiom the pot calling the kettle black, and called the phrase a &quot;famous example&quot; of &quot;tu quoque&quot; reasoning. The conservative magazine &quot;National Review&quot; called it &quot;a bitter Soviet-era punch line&quot;, and added &quot;there were a million Cold War variations on the joke&quot;. The Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; described use of the idiom as a form of Soviet propaganda. The British liberal political website &quot;Open Democracy&quot; called the phrase &quot;a prime example of whataboutism&quot;. In her work &quot;Security Threats and Public Perception&quot;, Elizaveta Gaufman described the fallacy as a tool to reverse someone&#x27;s argument against them.

== History ==

===Early usage===
The phrase was used as a Russian political joke about a dispute between an American and a Soviet man.

After receiving criticism of his country because of the deaths caused by the 1903 anti-Jewish Kishinev pogrom, the Russian Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve pointed out &quot;The Russian peasants were driven to frenzy. Excited by race and religious hatred, and under the influence of alcohol, they were worse than the people of the Southern States of America when they lynch negroes.&quot; Soviet artist Dmitri Moor produced the lithograph &quot;Freedom to the Prisoners of Scottsboro!&quot;, after the 1931 trial of the Scottsboro Boys of Alabama.

The treatment of the Scottsboro Boys popularized the phrase in usage by the Soviet Union against the US as a form of criticism against those who themselves criticized human rights abuses. In his 1934 book &quot;Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?&quot;, Sherwood Eddy wrote: &quot;In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked what they are going to do to the Scottsboro Negro boys and why they lynch Negroes.&quot;

In a 1930s argument with black student Pierre Kalmek, Bolshevik politician Dmitry Manuilsky said that in the United States &quot;whites have the privilege to lynch Negroes, but Negroes do not have the privilege to lynch whites.&quot; He called this a form of white chauvinism, asking: &quot;Do we have a difference here between the salaries of Negro and white workers? Do we have the right to lynch Negro citizens?&quot;

During the Stalin era, praise for the quality of any aspect of US life prompted the rejoinder &quot;Yes, but they lynch Blacks, don&#x27;t they?&quot; Throughout the 1930s, white men traveling from the US to the Soviet Union on business reported to the US consulate in Riga, Latvia, that locals asked them about the dichotomy between living in a free society and &quot;the &#x27;lynching&#x27; of blacks.&quot; The term worked its way into fiction literature books written in the country, and was seen in this context as criticism of foreigners. Years later a science fiction comic, &quot;Technique - The Youth&quot;1948.No. 2 titled &quot;In a world of crazy fantasy&quot; () featured a poem of political attacks on the cover which included a similar line: &quot;Every planet&#x27;s Negroes are being lynched there.&quot;

The phrase became a common witticism used among Soviet citizens; a parable involved a call-in program on Radio Moscow where any question about their living conditions was met with the answer: &quot;In America, they lynch Negroes.&quot; A US citizen living in the Soviet Union in 1949 was arrested after complaining the government barred him from work; a local paper made fun of his expectation of fair treatment, writing of the US as &quot;the country where they lynch Negroes.&quot; In 1949 Soviet author and war poet Konstantin Simonov gave a speech at a Soviet jubilee event honoring poet Alexander Pushkin (who had African ancestry), where he delineated between the Soviet Union and the Western world by simply using the phrase to refer to English speakers: &quot;There is no need for those who hang Negroes to commemorate Pushkin!&quot; Historian Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov wrote in his 1953 book &quot;The Reign of Stalin&quot; that Soviet media put forth the notion that US citizens &quot;are unanimous in pursuing an anti-colour policy, and that the average American spends his time lynching negroes.&quot; Perpetuation of the phrase during the Soviet period engendered negative feelings towards the US from members of the working class.

===Growth during the Cold War===
During the Cold War, the leftist French publication &quot;Combat&quot; used the phrase to criticize the operations of the House Un-American Activities Committee, pointing out what it saw as corruption of &quot;a nation that lynched blacks and hounded anyone accused of &#x27;un-American&#x27; activities.&quot; Use of the phrase as a &quot;tu quoque&quot; fallacy grew in popularity in Russia during the 1960s, and was used as a widespread quip between Russians. In this version, an American and a Soviet car salesman argue which country makes better cars. Finally, the American asks: &quot;How many decades does it take an average Soviet man to earn enough money to buy a Soviet car?&quot; After a thoughtful pause, the Soviet replies: &quot;And you are lynching Negroes!&quot; The phrase garnered numerous iterations during the Cold War period. Its pervasiveness in Russian society reflected a strong sense of Soviet patriotism. When the government faced criticism for discrimination against Jews in the Soviet Union, the idiom was used with excessively sentimental tone to complain about racism in the United States. It was used as an aphorism among fellow Soviets during the Mikhail Gorbachev period, as an answer to complaints about the lack of civil and political rights including freedom of movement. A variant used during this time as a form of reciprocity when faced with criticism over imprisonment and treatment of Refuseniks, was to put the focus on race in the United States criminal justice system. A similar phrase was used to counter complaints about Soviet transportation inefficiency.

In 1980 then dissident and later president of the Czech Republic and writer Václav Havel characterized the phrase among &quot;commonly canonized demagogical tricks.&quot; In scholarly research it has been described as &quot;an increasingly powerful propaganda tool with the intensification of the Cold War&quot;.

===Use in post-1991 Russia===

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the term had become a synecdoche in Russia, as a reference referring to all of Soviet propaganda. During a trip to Washington, D.C., in 1999, then-prime minister of Russia Sergei Stepashin attempted to tell a joke using the phrase as a punchline at a speech before the National Press Club. He faced a disturbing quiet from the audience in response to his attempt at humor, and he later observed those in the US have difficulty understanding the Russian perspective on comedy.

In a January 2008 article, &quot;The Economist&quot; popularized the term whataboutism for the repeated usage of this rhetorical tactic in the Soviet Union. The magazine wrote, that the tactic became overused, and by the time of the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, it had become a figure of speech which was used in reference to the entirety of Soviet propaganda.

With the election of Barack Obama as US president in November 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; expressed the hope that the tactic could see decreased usage: &quot;In Russia, for example, where Soviet leaders used to respond to any American criticism of human rights violations with &#x27;But you hang Negroes,&#x27; analysts note that the election of Mr. Obama removes a stain.&quot;

In a 2009 article, journalist George Feifer recounted that when he traveled to Moscow to cover the American National Exhibition in 1959, he faced those who were using the phrase against him. Feifer believed that: &quot;Skilled propagandists stationed among the listeners regularly interrupted to repeat questions intended to discredit me. &quot;Why did America tolerate shameful poverty and lynch Negroes?&quot;&quot; In 2011, author Michael Dobson wrote that the phrase was a form of the pot calling the kettle black, and a &quot;famous example&quot; of the tu quoque fallacy derived from a &quot;famous 1960s era Russian joke.&quot;

During the Ferguson unrest in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white policeman who shot and killed an unarmed black adolescent was not indicted, state-controlled press coverage in Russia was highly critical of racism in the United States. Writing for &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;, journalist Allison Quinn posited that coverage of the protests in Ferguson served as an optimal method to distract media from the Russo-Ukrainian war. Quinn said, &quot;American racism provided a go-to argument of American hypocrisy for years under the Soviet Union, with phrases like &#x27;Well, you lynch negroes&#x27; hurled back at the U.S. in response to any allegations of human rights violations in the Soviet Union.&quot; She compared the Ferguson unrest coverage by Russia state-controlled media to prior use of this phrase as a form of Soviet propaganda. Writing in March 2014 for the American liberal magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Julia Ioffe made a similar comparison as Quinn regarding Soviet versus the 2014 use of the technique. Ioffe wrote that the phrase took the form of a &quot;cartoonish reply&quot;, and had been extended after the fall of Soviet Russia to a similar strategy used by Vladimir Putin.

By 2015, the phrase had entered the common lexicon in Russia as a tool to criticize any form of US policy. Russians used the term between themselves so often it became a form of satire, as a ubiquitous rejoinder to all crises dealt with and low quality of life, including purchasing groceries or dealing with road congestion.

In a 2015 article for the conservative magazine &quot;National Review&quot;, correspondent Kevin D. Williamson called the phrase &quot;a bitter Soviet-era punch line.&quot; Williamson pointed out: &quot;There were a million Cold War variations on the joke&quot;. Reporter David Volodzko wrote for the international news magazine &quot;The Diplomat&quot; in 2015 about &quot;the famous tu quoque argument&quot;. The piece said that the term was used as a way to criticize capitalism as practiced in the Western world. Writing for the British liberal political website &quot;Open Democracy&quot; in 2015, journalist Maxim Edwards observed: &quot;The phrase &#x27;and you are lynching Negroes&#x27; has entered Russian speech as a prime example of whataboutism, a hypothetical response to any American criticism of Soviet policies.&quot;

Michael Bohm, a US reporter who is working out of Moscow, became the target of the phrase after he appeared on &quot;Sunday Evening With Vladimir Solovyov&quot;, which aired on the major state-run television channel Russia-1. Commentator Igor Korotchenko wrote: &quot;people like Bohm dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they lynched Negroes.&quot; In a 2015 contribution to the Russian journal &quot;International Affairs&quot;, Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and editor-in-chief Armen Oganesyan lamented the likelihood a Russian rejoinder to an international treaty&#x27;s publication by the US State Department would be viewed as a form of the &quot;you lynch Negroes&quot; response. Ryabkov and Oganesyan wrote that this reaction harmed the collaborative process as it was important for nation-states to disagree and enable discourse.

Journalist Catherine Putz commented on the phrase in a July 2016 article for the international news magazine &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, and compared it to use of whataboutism by businessman and politician Donald Trump: &quot;Criticisms of human rights in the Soviet Union were often met with what became a common catchphrase: &#x27;And you are lynching Negroes&#x27;.&quot; Writing for &quot;ChinaFile&quot; after Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election, James Palmer feared an increase in racism &quot;would give a brutal new credibility to the old Soviet whataboutism whenever they were challenged on the gulag: &#x27;But in America, you lynch Negroes&#x27;.&quot; Writing in July 2016 for the liberal Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Israeli journalist Chemi Shalev made a similar comparison: &quot;Trump told &quot;[T]he New York Times&quot; this week that America is in such a mess in terms of civil liberties that it cannot lecture foreign countries anymore, which is an echo of old Soviet propaganda that responded to American reprimands with the retort &#x27;And you are lynching Negroes&#x27;.&quot; Shalev followed up on this analysis in a September 2016 article, writing: &quot;Trump conducts pro-Russian propaganda along the same lines as the old retort &#x27;And You Hang Blacks&#x27; with which the Soviets tried to deflect U.S. criticism of their human rights abuses. He isn&#x27;t troubled by Putin&#x27;s political opponents being murdered, because &#x27;people get killed here too&#x27;.&quot;

In 2017, in response to the UK&#x27;s criticism of the annexation of Crimea, the Russian ambassador to the UN suggested that the UK should first return the Falklands and Gibraltar.

Following the 2024 Russian presidential election, Vladimir Putin gave a speech after the close of voting on March 17. He acknowledged the February 2024 death of opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who had been held in a Russian penal colony, but did not comment as to the cause of death or who was ultimately responsible. &quot;As for Mr. Navalnyyes, he passed away. It is always a sad event. And there were other cases when people in prisons passed away. Didn&#x27;t this happen in the United States? It did, and not once.&quot;

=== Use in Eastern Europe ===
Alternate versions of the phrase have been used in Eastern European satellite countries then-controlled by the Soviet Union, such, that it was ported for usage in Poland. The phrase also saw usage in other languages, including Czech, Hungarian, and Romanian.

Similar phrases in the languages of Eastern Europe include:
* (&quot;And, in turn, you beat up blacks!&quot;)
* (&quot;And in America, they beat up Negroes&quot;)
* (&quot;And at your place, they beat up Negroes!&quot;)
* (&quot;Yes, but you are lynching Negroes!&quot;)
* (&quot;Yes, but you are beating up Negroes!&quot;)

=== Usage by other countries ===
In addition to Soviet Union and its satellites, and later, Russia, similar deflecting arguments related to racism in the United States have been used by a number of politicians, diplomats and state-controlled media from countries whose human rights abuses have been criticized by the United States government, NGOs or citizens. Countries which have been said to use the &quot;Are you lynching Negroes&quot; rhetoric in the early 21st century include China, Iran, Syria and North Korea.

== Analysis ==

The 1993 book &quot;Exit from Communism&quot;, edited by Stephen Richards Graubard, argued that this saying encapsulated an overall divorce from reality: &quot;Perhaps there are and perhaps there are not prison camps in Siberia, perhaps in the United States they do or perhaps they do not lynch blacks ... Ultimately it does not matter whether we are for real or just pretending: it is all just part of the story.&quot;

In her 2016 work &quot;Security Threats and Public Perception&quot;, Elizaveta Gaufman characterized the phrase as a form of reversing someone&#x27;s line of reasoning against them. Gaufman wrote that by using this phrase in an argument one was tacitly refusing to answer queries posted to them and instead responding with condemnations.

=== Agency of African Americans ===
It has been argued that African Americans have had a more nuanced position in this issue between the two states, highlighting their agency despite being used for propaganda gains of others. While repeatedly confronting the exploitation of African Americans by and for the gains of Soviet propaganda, African Americans have nevertheless been expanding on such use for the sake of the raised issue of racism and its institutionalization; this effect of the instrumentalisation is being often lost when discussing the issue, and has been criticized. African-American novelist Zora Neale Hurston was a staunch anti-communist, and she wrote a 1951 essay titled &quot;Why The Negro Won&#x27;t Buy Communism&quot; which criticized communist propaganda targeting African-Americans.

<text>Michael George Appleby is a politician, cannabis activist, and lawyer based in Wellington, New Zealand.

==Background==
Appleby is a human rights lawyer with a B.A. in politics and English, and an M.A. in Administrative Law, Taxation and Trusts, and Constitutional Law. He has taught law at various universities around New Zealand and Australia.

==Political career==
In addition to his legal career, Appleby was the leader of the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party (ALCP) from its foundation in 1996 until 2013. This small political party is dedicated to the relaxation or repeal of laws against the use of cannabis and has never been represented in Parliament. In 1998 he was elected a member of the Terawhiti Licensing Trust as an ALCP candidate.

Appleby has stood as his party&#x27;s candidate in the electorate since its inception in 1996. His best result was in the 1999 election where he gained third place, aided by the fact that most major candidates had pulled out to support either incumbent Richard Prebble or challenger Marian Hobbs. He came fifth in the 2011 election. He later represented the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party in the 2013 Ikaroa-Rāwhiti by-election.

Appleby stood unsuccessfully for the Wellington City Council in October 2004. He ran again for the Wellington City Council in the October 2013 local government elections, where he placed ninth in the Lambton Ward and was not elected.

During the 2020 New Zealand general election, Appleby contested Wellington Central for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, gaining 240 votes.

During the 2023 New Zealand general election, Appleby stood as a candidate for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party in Wellington Central. He came sixth place, gaining only 418 votes.

<doc id="662837" wikidata="Q130778" url="?curid=662837" title="Cicadidae">
<text>Cicadidae, the true cicadas, is one of two families of cicadas. With more than 3,200 species worldwide, it contains all but two of the living cicada species.

== Evolution ==
The earliest fossils of cicadas more closely related to Cicadidae than to Tettigarctidae date to the Jurassic period. The morphology of well preserved stem cicadids from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber from Myanmar suggests that unlike many modern cicadas, they were either silent or only made quiet sounds. The oldest modern cicadids date to the Paleocene.

== Description ==
Cicadas are large insects characterized by their membranous wings, triangular-formation of three ocelli on the top of their heads, and their short, bristle-like antennae.

== Life cycle ==
Cicadas are generally separated into two categories based on their adult emergence pattern. Annual cicadas remain underground as nymphs for two or more years and the population is not locally synchronized in its development, so that some adults mature each year or in most years. Periodical cicadas also have multiple-year life cycles but emerge in synchrony or near synchrony in any one location and are absent as adults in the intervening years. The most well-known periodical cicadas, genus &quot;Magicicada&quot;, emerge as adults every 13 or 17 years.

== Ecology ==
=== Communication ===
Cicadas are known for the loud airborne sounds that males of most species make to attract mates. One member of this family, &quot;Brevisana brevis&quot;, the &quot;shrill thorntree cicada&quot;, is the loudest insect in the world, able to produce a song that exceeds 100 decibels. Male cicadas can produce four types of acoustic signals: songs, calls, low-amplitude songs, and disturbance sounds. Unlike members of the order Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets, and katydids), who use stridulation to produce sounds, members of Cicadidae produce sounds using a pair of tymbals, which are modified membranes located on the abdomen. In order to produce sound, each tymbal is pulled inwards by a connected muscle, and the deformation of the stiff membrane produces a &#x27;click.&#x27;

== Reproduction ==
Newly emerged cicadas climb up trees and molt into their adult stage, now equipped with wings. Males call to attract females, producing the distinct noisy songs cicadas are known for. Females respond to males with a &#x27;click&#x27; made by flicking their wings. Once a male has found a female partner, his call changes to indicate that they are a mating pair.

== Classification ==
Cicadidae is one of two families within the superfamily Cicadoidea. This superfamily is in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, containing cicadas, hoppers, and relatives, within the order Hemiptera, the true bugs. There are five subfamilies within Cicadidae: Cicadettinae, Cicadinae, Tettigomyiinae, Tibicininae, and Derotettiginae.

<text>Crist (Old English for &quot;Christ&quot;) is the title of any of three Old English religious poems in the Exeter Book. They were initially believed to be a three-part work by a single late 9th and early 10th century author, but more recent scholarship has argued that the works are more likely of differing origins.

:&quot;Crist I&quot; (also &quot;Crist A&quot; or &quot;Advent Lyrics&quot;), a poem in twelve sections on Christ&#x27;s Advent written by an unknown author (or authors).

<doc id="662844" wikidata="Q303462" url="?curid=662844" title="First-class citizen">
<text>In a given programming language design, a first-class citizen is an entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable.

==History==

The concept of first- and second-class objects was introduced by Christopher Strachey in the 1960s. He did not actually define the term strictly, but contrasted real numbers and procedures in ALGOL:
First and second class objects. In ALGOL, a real number may appear in an expression or be assigned to a variable, and either of them may appear as an actual parameter in a procedure call. A procedure, on the other hand, may only appear in another procedure call either as the operator (the most common case) or as one of the actual parameters. There are no other expressions involving procedures or whose results are procedures. Thus in a sense procedures in ALGOL are second class citizens—they always have to appear in person and can never be represented by a variable or expression (except in the case of a formal parameter)...

Robin Popplestone gave the following definition:
All items have certain fundamental rights.
# All items can be the actual parameters of functions
# All items can be returned as results of functions
# All items can be the subject of assignment statements
# All items can be tested for equality.

During the 1990s, Raphael Finkel proposed definitions of second and third class values, but these definitions have not been widely adopted.

==Examples==

The simplest scalar data types, such as integer and floating-point numbers, are nearly always first-class.

In many older languages, arrays and strings are not first-class: they cannot be assigned as objects or passed as parameters to a subroutine. For example, neither Fortran IV nor C supports array assignment, and when they are passed as parameters, only the position of their first element is actually passed—their size is lost. C appears to support assignment of array pointers, but in fact these are simply pointers to the array&#x27;s first element, and again do not carry the array&#x27;s size.

In most languages, data types are not first-class objects, though in some object-oriented languages, classes are first-class objects and are instances of metaclasses. Languages in the functional programming family often also feature first-class types, in the form of, for example, generalized algebraic data types, or other metalanguage amenities enabling programs to implement extensions to their own implementation language.

Few languages support continuations and GOTO-labels as objects at all, let alone as first-class objects.

==Functions==
Many programming languages support passing and returning function values, which can be applied to arguments. Whether this suffices to call function values first-class is disputed.

Some authors require it be possible to create new functions at runtime to call them &#x27;first-class&#x27;. Under this definition, functions in C are not first-class objects; instead, they are sometimes called second-class objects, because they can still be manipulated in most of the above fashions (via function pointers).

In Smalltalk, functions (methods) are first-class objects, just like Smalltalk classes. Since Smalltalk operators (+, -, etc.) are methods, they are also first-class objects.

==Reflection==

Some languages, such as Java and PHP, have an explicit reflection subsystem which allow access to internal implementation structures even though they are not accessible or manipulable in the same way as ordinary objects.

In other languages, such as those in the Lisp family, reflection is a central feature of the language, rather than a special subsystem. Typically this takes the form of some set of the following features:
* syntactic macros or fexprs - which allow the user to write code which handles code as data and evaluates it by discretion, enabling, for example, programs to write programs (or rewrite themselves) inside of the compiler, interpreter, or even the parser (reader macros);
* a meta-circular evaluator - which provides a definition of the language&#x27;s evaluator as a compiled tautologisation of itself, facilitating straightforward modification of the language without requiring a metalanguage different from itself;
* a metaobject protocol - a special form of meta-circular evaluator for object-oriented programming, in which the object system implements itself recursively via a system of metaclasses and metaobjects, which are themselves classes and objects.
These allow varying forms of first-class access to the language implementation, and are, in general, manipulable in the same way as, and fully indistinguishable from, ordinary language objects. Because of this, their usage generally comes with some (cultural) stipulations and advice, as untested modification of the core programming system by users can easily undermine performance optimisations made by language implementers.

<doc id="662845" wikidata="Q7529640" url="?curid=662845" title="Sir William James, 1st Baronet">
<text>Commodore Sir William James, 1st Baronet (5 September 1721 – 16 December 1783) was a Welsh naval officer and politician who sat in the British House of Commons representing West Looe from 1774 to 1783. James is best known for his career in India, where he served as an officer in the Bombay Marine, the navy of the East India Company (EIC), and led several successful campaigns against forces commanded by the Angre family.

Born on 5 September 1721 near Milford Haven, James went to sea at an early age. Initially serving on a coaster from Bristol, James entertained a brief stint as a Royal Navy cabin boy before becoming a sea captain engaged in the trade between Britain and its colonies. During the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, James was briefly imprisoned by the Spanish before being released and making his way back to England during the 1740s, when he married.

In 1747, James entered into the service of the East India Company, serving as first mate onboard two Company ships before being appointed as an officer in the Bombay Marine. Commanding the 44-gun warship &quot;Protector&quot;, James participated in several successful expeditions against fortresses controlled by the Angre family, whose ships frequently launched attacks on EIC merchant shipping. He returned to England in 1759 a wealthy man.

Settling down in England, James remarried and purchased an English country house in Eltham, in addition to being elected several times as a director of the East India Company. Harbouring political ambitions, he was elected to the British Parliament in the 1774 general election. James died in his London home on 16 December 1783, leaving behind his wife and two children. Severndroog Castle was built in 1784 by his widow to memorialise him.

==Early life==

William James was born on 5 September 1721 near the town of Milford Haven, Wales. Information about his parents is extremely scarce; English politician Nathaniel Wraxall wrote that &quot;[his] origin was so obscure as almost to baffle inquiry.&quot; His father was variously reported to be either a miller or farmer, and some accounts claimed that James worked as a ploughboy before embarking on a career at sea, reportedly at the age of twelve.

The first merchant ship that James served onboard was a coastal trading vessel operating out of Bristol, though historian Charles Rathbone Low claimed that by 1738 James, by now at the age of sixteen, had entered into the Royal Navy as a cabin boy. After a few years, James left the navy and became a sea captain, sailing a merchant ship which participated in the trade between Virginia, the British West Indies and Great Britain.

While serving as a sea captain, James was captured during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear by the Royal Spanish Navy after his ship was shipwrecked. He was imprisoned for a period before being released, making his way back to England at some point during the 1740s. There, he married a woman, whose identity was reported to be either the landlady of a Wapping pub or a widow whose husband had been the captain of an East Indiaman.

==Career in India==

In 1747, James entered into the service of the East India Company (EIC), serving as first mate onboard the Company ship &quot;Hardwicke&quot;. Two years later in 1749, he was transferred to the &quot;Suffolk&quot; before becoming an officer in the Bombay Marine, the navy of the EIC. His first command was the warship &quot;Guardian&quot;, and James served as a senior officer in a small squadron which operated between Bombay (then under Company control) and Goa.

During this period, the Bombay Marine was primarily focused on protecting Company shipping against attacks from ships commanded by the Angre family. James spent a period of time convoying EIC ships, which led to a reduction in losses. In recognition of his efforts, James was eventually promoted to the rank of Commodore in 1751 and placed in command of the &quot;Protector&quot;, a 44-gun warship. She had been constructed at the Bombay Dockyard by the East India Company to protect their trade routes on the Malabar Coast.

In April 1755, James participated in an expedition against the fortress of Severndroog, which was controlled by the Angre family, in conjunction with Maratha forces. James led his squadron, which consisted of the &quot;Protector&quot;, &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Bombay&quot;, into the fortress harbour and directed an effective offshore naval bombardment which led to the Severndroog garrison capitulating on 2 April. After taking control of the fortress, James quickly handed over control to his Maratha allies before returning to Bombay in order to avoid the seasonal monsoons damaging his squadron.

Seven months later, a Royal Navy squadron commanded by Charles Watson arrived in Bombay, linking up with James and Colonel Robert Clive. The British decided to mount another expedition against the Angre family. On February 1756, a British force sailed from Bombay to attack a fortress at Gheriah which was under the Angre family&#x27;s control. The British captured the fortress with no casualties, breaking the power of the Angre family. Although control of the fortress was handed over to British-allied Maratha forces, 130,000 rupees worth of loot fell into British hands.

In 1757, James, who was in Bombay, was charged by his superiors with informing Watson, who was commanding a squadron near the French Indian city of Chandernagore, of an outbreak of war between Great Britain and France. As noted by historian T. H. Bowyer, since the seasonal Northeast monsoon made travelling through the Bay of Bengal dangerous, James made a detour via Sumatra, which allowed him to reach the Hooghly River and inform Watson in &quot;exceptionally good time.&quot; James continued serving in the Bombay Marine until 1759, when he returned to England.

==Later life and death==
James had acquired a large fortune during his career in India, primarily through his private business dealings and prize money. Once he had returned to England, James purchased Park Farm Place, an English country house in Eltham, Kent. On 15 June 1765, he remarried to Anne Goddard in St Marylebone Parish Church. James, a supporter of fellow EIC official and politician Laurence Sulivan, was elected as a director of the East India Company in 1768.

Despite his relationship with Sulivan, James soon began cultivating a friendship with prominent statesman John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, &quot;whose influence brought him the honours that he enjoyed.&quot; On 22 July 1769, he was appointed as an elder brother of Trinity House, before rising to the position of deputy master in 1778. During this period, James was also served as a governor of Greenwich Hospital, a permanent home for retired British sailors.

James also started to harbour political ambitions, unsuccessfully running in a parliamentary by-election for the New Shoreham constituency in 1770. Although he was also attempting to secure the governorship of Bombay during this period, James withdrew his candidature after making his political aspirations clear to government officials. In the 1774 British general election, James was elected to the House of Commons, representing West Looe.

In Parliament, James continued to support both the Earl of Sandwich and the ministry of incumbent Prime Minister Lord North. However, his relationship with Sulivan started to deteriorate when under government pressure James voted for the recall of EIC official Warren Hastings. In 1776, James secured a government contract to provision British forces stationed in Canada; in the same year, he was also elected as a deputy chairman of the East India Company.

On 27 August 1778, James was granted a baronetcy, the same date as he was re-elected as deputy chairman. His relationship with Sulivan had improved to the point where James was twice elected as chairman again, in 1779 and 1781. Together, the two successfully defended accusations from a parliamentary committee that they had secretly altered EIC records in order to mislead the committee, maintaining that the charges were &quot;without foundation.&quot; James died at his home on Gerrard Street, London on 16 December 1783, and was buried at Eltham six days later.

==Personal life, family and legacy==

According to Bowyer, James &quot;seems never to have shown any inclination to shed light on the first thirty years of his life; he left no tracks, only conjecture.&quot; He had two children with his second wife Anne, a son named Edward and a daughter named Elizabeth. Edward, who was born in 1774, succeeded his father&#x27;s title and died unmarried in 1792, leading to the baronetcy becoming extinct. Elizabeth, named as sole heir of James&#x27; estate, married Thomas Parkyns, who was later elevated to the Irish peerage as Baron Rancliffe. Together, the couple had nine children.

During and after his career in India, rumours developed that James had married an Indian woman and had a son named Richard who was supposedly the first person of Asian descent to succeed to a British title; these have been dismissed as baseless by Bowyer. Relationships between European employees of the East India Company and Indian women were common during the 18th century; Scottish historian William Dalrymple noted in his 2004 work &quot;White Mughals&quot; that roughly one in three wills left by EIC employees during this period left something to an Indian spouse.

After James died, Anne commissioned English architect Richard Jupp to construct Severndroog Castle, a triangular Gothic folly built in 1784. The building was constructed at the summit of Shooter&#x27;s Hill near Blackheath, and was intended by Anne to serve as a memorial to her husband, being named after the site of his most famous victory. During the First World War, Severndroog Castle served as an observation post for a detachment of Special Constabulary officers, who were charged with detecting incoming air raids over London by the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;.

James&#x27; victories over the Angre family have been seen by historians David Cordingly and John Falconer as marking a turning point for the fortunes of the East India Company in establishing naval supremacy in India. They noted that prior to James&#x27; arrival in India, the Bombay Marine had participated in several unsuccessful battles against the Angre family, who after their defeats at Severndroog and Gheriah ceased to pose an effective threat to Company shipping. The pair attributed James&#x27; victories to the EIC&#x27;s superior ship-making skills &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; that of the Angre family.

<text>Homarus gammarus, known as the European lobster or common lobster, is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea. It is closely related to the American lobster, &quot;H. americanus&quot;. It may grow to a length of and a mass of , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life, the lobsters are blue, only becoming &quot;lobster red&quot; on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae. &quot;Homarus gammarus&quot; is a highly esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around the British Isles.

==Description==

&quot;Homarus gammarus&quot; is a large crustacean, with a body length up to and weighing up to , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually long and weigh . Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called ecdysis (molting). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1–2 years for larger animals.

The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of feet. The larger one is the &quot;crusher&quot;, and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the &quot;cutter&quot;, which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter.

The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment.

The closest relative of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; is the American lobster, &quot;Homarus americanus&quot;. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics:
*The rostrum of &quot;H. americanus&quot; bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in &quot;H. gammarus&quot;.
*The spines on the claws of &quot;H. americanus&quot; are red or red-tipped, while those of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; are white or white-tipped.
*The underside of the claw of &quot;H. americanus&quot; is orange or red, while that of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; is creamy white or very pale red.

==Life cycle==

Female &quot;H. gammarus&quot; reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female, whose shell is therefore soft, and a hard-shelled male. The female carries the eggs attached to her pleopods for up to 12 months, depending on the temperature. Females carrying eggs are said to be &quot;berried&quot; and can be found throughout the year.

The eggs hatch at night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15–35 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase. When they reach a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives.

==Distribution==

&quot;Homarus gammarus&quot; is found across the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, not including the Baltic Sea. It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea, only missing from the section east of Crete, and along only the south-west coast of the Black Sea. The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords Tysfjorden and Nordfolda, inside the Arctic Circle.

The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations, one widespread population, and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes, possibly due to adaptation to the local environment. The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway, which have been referred to as the &quot;midnight-sun lobster&quot;. The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean. The last distinct population is found in part of the Netherlands: samples from the Oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel.

Attempts have been made to introduce &quot;H. gammarus&quot; to New Zealand, alongside other European species such as the edible crab, &quot;Cancer pagurus&quot;. Between 1904 and 1914, one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin, but the species did not become established there.

==Ecology==
Adult &quot;H. gammarus&quot; live on the continental shelf at depths of , although not normally deeper than . They prefer hard substrates, such as rocks or hard mud, and live in holes or crevices, emerging at night to feed.

The diet of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; mostly consists of other benthic invertebrates. These include crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, starfish and polychaete worms.

The three clawed lobster species &quot;Homarus gammarus&quot;, &quot;H. americanus&quot; and &quot;Nephrops norvegicus&quot; are hosts to the three known species of the animal phylum Cycliophora; the species on &quot;H. gammarus&quot; has not been described.

&quot;Homarus gammarus&quot; is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia, caused by the bacterium &quot;Aerococcus viridans&quot;. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive &quot;H. gammarus&quot;, where prior occupation of the tanks by &quot;H. americanus&quot; could not be ruled out.

==Human consumption==
&quot;Homarus gammarus&quot; is traditionally &quot;highly esteemed&quot; as a foodstuff and was mentioned in &quot;The Crabfish&quot; a seventeenth century English folk song. It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh, frozen, canned or powdered. Both the claws and the abdomen of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; contain &quot;excellent&quot; white meat, and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible. The exceptions are the gastric mill and the &quot;sand vein&quot; (gut). The price of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; is up to three times higher than that of &quot;H. americanus&quot;, and the European species is considered to be more flavorful.

Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots, although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out, to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand. In 2008, 4,386 t of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; were caught across Europe and North Africa, of which 3,462 t (79%) was caught in the British Isles (including the Channel Islands). The minimum landing size for &quot;H. gammarus&quot; is a carapace length of . To protect known breeding females, lobsters caught carrying eggs are to be notched on a uropod, the inner tail flap of female lobsters of reproductive size (usually above the minimum landing size 87mm carapace length). Following this, it is illegal for the female to be kept or sold, and is commonly referred to as a &quot;v-notch&quot;. This notch remains for three molts of the lobster exoskeleton, providing harvest protection and continued breeding availability for 3–5 years.

Aquaculture systems for &quot;H. gammarus&quot; are under development, and production rates are still very low.

==Taxonomic history==
&quot;Homarus gammarus&quot; was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, published in 1758. That name was &quot;Cancer gammarus&quot;, since Linnaeus&#x27; concept of the genus &quot;Cancer&quot; at that time included all large crustaceans.

&quot;H. gammarus&quot; is the type species of the genus &quot;Homarus&quot; , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Prior to that direction, confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names, including &quot;Astacus marinus&quot; and &quot;Homarus vulgaris&quot; , and also because Friedrich Weber&#x27;s description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary J. Rathbun, rendering any prior assignments of type species (for &quot;Homarus&quot; ) invalid for &quot;Homarus&quot; .

The type specimen of &quot;Homarus gammarus&quot; was a lectotype selected by Lipke Holthuis in 1974. It came from , near Marstrand, Sweden ( northwest of Gothenburg), but both it and the paralectotypes have since been lost.

The common name for &quot;H. gammarus&quot; preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is &quot;European lobster&quot;, but the species is also widely known as the &quot;common lobster&quot;.

<doc id="662856" wikidata="Q4778800" url="?curid=662856" title="Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party">
<text>Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party (ALCP), also known as the Cannabis Party, is a political party in New Zealand. It is dedicated to the legalisation of cannabis for medical, recreational and industrial use. It was founded in 1996 and has stood in every general election since, but has never won representation in Parliament. Several of its members have gone on to political success after leaving the party.

==Party history==

=== Cannabis in New Zealand ===

Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in New Zealand. Its use today is regulated by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, which classes it as either a Class B drug (&quot;Very high risk of harm&quot;) or a Class C drug (&quot;moderate risk of harm&quot;), depending on the product or substance. From December 2018, the Misuse of Drugs act was amended allowing for much broader use of medical marijuana, making the drug available to terminally ill patients in the last 12 months of life.

Also in December 2018, the Government announced a non-binding referendum on cannabis for personal use, to be held as part of the 2020 general election, though the final result was against legalisation.

=== Party foundation and actions ===
The Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party was founded on 30 May 1996, in Timaru. Michael Appleby led the party from 1996 until standing down in 2013. Currently the ALCP is co-led by Maki Herbert and Michael Appleby, with Steven Wilkinson as its president.

The ALCP has contested all eight general elections held since its founding, as well as all twelve by-elections. The party has never won representation in Parliament.

In 2008, the party invited Dunedin South MP David Benson-Pope to join the ALCP, but he declined, saying, &quot;Their judgement has obviously been impaired by their recreational habits&quot;.

== Policies ==
The ALCP&#x27;s policies all relate to cannabis, hemp, or drug education. These include legalising possession, growing and use of cannabis for those over 18, creating a &#x27;medpot&#x27; card, taxing companies involved in the cannabis industry, removing the need for a licence to grow hemp, and funding drug education and research.

== Members&#x27; success outside of ALCP ==
Two ALCP candidates went on to become Members of Parliament for the Green Party. Nándor Tánczos and Metiria Turei were both ALCP candidates in 1996; Tánczos became a Green MP in 1999 and Turei became a Green MP in 2002. Another ALCP candidate, Tim Shadbolt, has been elected mayor in three places; prior to running for ALCP in 1996 he was mayor of Waitemata from 1983 to 1989 and mayor of Invercargill from 1993 to 1995, and afterwards he became the mayor of Invercargill from 1998 until 2022.

Former president and deputy leader Abe Gray founded Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand&#x27;s first and only cannabis museum, and has been a high-profile cannabis activist and protester for decades. Gray is now a member of The Opportunities Party (TOP). TOP&#x27;s policy on legalising cannabis has been praised by the president of NORML New Zealand, Chris Fowlie.

==Electoral results==

=== General elections ===
The ALCP has nominated candidates for electorate seats in each election since its foundation. No ALCP candidate has ever won a seat.

Their best general election result was in the 1996 election, where it won 1.66% of the party vote. It won 1.10% of the party vote in 1999, but since then the ALCP has not received more than 1% of the party vote in any election.

=== By-elections ===
The ALCP has also contested many by-elections. Its most successful result was in the 2004 Te Tai Hauauru by-election. Only the Māori Party, the ALCP, and independents contested this by-election. The ALCP candidate, Dun Mihaka, finished second behind Māori Party leader Tariana Turia, receiving 197 votes (2.52%) to Turia&#x27;s 7,256 (92.74%).

<doc id="662857" wikidata="Q7042924" url="?curid=662857" title="No. 1321 Flight RAF">
<text>No. 1321 Bomber (Defence) Training Flight RAF was first formed at RAF Bottesford on 1 September 1944 as a fighter affiliation unit to train bomber crews from No. 5 Group Bomber Command how to defend their aircraft. The Flight was disbanded two months later on 1 November 1944 and absorbed by the units they trained before, 1668 Heavy Conversion Unit and 1669 Heavy Conversion Unit.

No. 1321 (Valiant/Blue Danube Trials) Flight RAF was reformed at RAF Wittering on 3 August 1954 as a Vickers Valiant unit to integrate the Blue Danube nuclear weapon into Royal Air Force service.
It was commanded by Squadron Leader D. Roberts, formerly commanding officer of No. 617 Squadron. Squadron Leader Roberts had earlier reported to Wisley Airfield, the Vickers-Armstrongs flight test airfield in Surrey, expecting to take a three-week conversion course to the Valiant. Instead he remained there for 15 months until he reported to Wittering to command 1321 Flight.
1321 Flight&#x27;s first aircraft was Valiant WP201. Roberts and his crew flew it from Wisley to Wittering on 15 June 1955 to begin an intensive program of integration tests. The tests had two main separate components:
# Ballistic performance of the bomb casing at various altitudes and speeds
# Testing of the equipment from the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment under operational conditions
A variety of BTV (Ballistic Test Vehicle) drops were carried out at various heights and speeds at the experimental Bombing Range on Orfordness. The ballistic performance of the weapon was found to be so good that there was a risk of it not leaving the slipstream of the bomber and consequently flying along with the aircraft. Retractable spoilers were fitted to the underside of the fuselage, just forward of the bomb bay in order to induce turbulence within the bomb bay enabling the bomb to fall away.
All the live nuclear weapons dropped at Maralinga (Australia) and Christmas Island (Pacific Ocean) were assembled, pre-drop tested and loaded on to specially prepared Valiant bombers of 49 Squadron and 138 Squadron by the small team of technical specialists from 1321 Flight.
The life of 1321 (Valiant/Blue Danube Trials) Flight came to an end on 15 March 1956 when it became &#x27;C&#x27; Flight of No. 138 Squadron, the first regular Valiant unit.

The flight was reformed, once again, by the merger of the Avro Lincoln element of 199 Squadron, called Arrow Squadron and Antler Squadron, to become No. 1321 (ECM) Flight RAF at RAF Hemswell on 1 October 1957, disbanding on 31 March 1958 and absorbed by the Bomber Command Bombing School.

<text>The Red–Green Alliance or Unity List (, , EL) is an eco-socialist political party in Denmark. It was founded in 1989 with the merger of three Marxist parties and it is the most left-wing party in the Folketing, where it advocates for the expansion of the welfare state and social justice as well as the socialist transformation of Denmark and the entire globe. During the 2021 Copenhagen City Council election the party placed first, with 24.6% of the votes. The party is also active in various trade unions within Denmark.

== Ideological position ==
The party describes itself as a democratic and socialist grassroots party, which represents green politics, among the Danish peace, civil and political rights, and labour movements. The party&#x27;s ideological position is set out in a manifesto from 2014. It proposes that a socialistic society of the future &quot;neither can nor should be described in detail, but rather be developed and shaped by the people living in it&quot;. It describes socialism as &quot;an answer to the problems caused by capitalism such as non-sufficient democracy, crises, destruction of nature, inequality, racism and war&quot;.

Holding anti-capitalist and soft Eurosceptic views, it states this about the economic system:
A new and actually democratic system of society requires fundamental changes in the ownership of the means of production, such as companies, land and natural resources. Collective forms of ownership will be dominating. We propose that public authorities, co-workers, local communities and other collectives of persons should own and run institutions and companies. ... A democratic economy means a democratic work life as well. The work place should be characterized by democracy, and the employees must have a constitutional right to decisive influence on the organization of work in the workplace.

The Red–Green Alliance recognizes that methods achieving this may differ depending on the course of class struggle, but will eventually require a revolution—one that must be supported by a majority of the population manifested through democratic and free elections. The party often adopts particular views in relation to the other parties in the Folketing and opt out of many of the settlements reached, seen as an expression of class collaboration. Until the conditions for the party&#x27;s long-term goal are presented, the party will use its seats in parliament to vote for any improvement and against any deterioration of working-class people&#x27;s lives. In line with this, the party agreed at its national conference in 2010 that if Helle Thorning-Schmidt became Prime Minister after the 2011 election, the party would vote for a &quot;red&quot; budget bill that did not contain obvious flaws.

== Policies ==

=== Social policy ===
The party places great emphasis on the fight against social inequality and poverty, and is in favour of strengthening and expanding the welfare state. The party believes there is a place in society for all forms of diversity, including gender, sexuality, disability and ethnic background. It also advocates for a larger public sector, among other things, to improve quality of life for public sector employees.

The party believes people should be free to choose when they want to get an education and is opposed to tuition fees, which they believe harm opportunities for everyone to acquire an education. The party does not see unemployment as being equal to laziness and seeks to abolish the Danish equivalent of workfare.

=== Economic policy ===
The party is decisively anti-capitalist and has particularly distinguished itself as an opponent of transfer pricing, whereby multinational companies minimise the amount they pay in tax by attributing their profits to countries with lower tax rates.

In response to the Great Recession of 2007–2009, the Red–Green Alliance urged stricter control of loans, the introduction of a Tobin tax, and the nationalisation of banks and mortgage companies. It also believes that the public sector must be expanded, the wages of the lowest-paid workers raised, and that the insurance-based unemployment benefit period should be extended to a minimum of four years. At the same time, it believes that students should be given a greater grant to be used in state education. At minimum, all benefits should be raised to 13,500 kroner per month before taxes.

=== Foreign policy ===
The party advocates for foreign policy based on the respect for human rights, which it believes has never been appropriately prioritised in the past. It also proposes greater support for developing countries through a doubling of foreign aid, and campaigns for Denmark&#x27;s withdrawal from NATO. In March 2019, the party announced it would no longer campaign for a referendum to leave the EU, pointing to Brexit illustrating the need for clarity before withdrawal can be considered.

The party operates on the fundamental belief that peace is preferable to war, and opposed to Denmark&#x27;s participation in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from the onset of them. That principle was challenged in 2011, when the party&#x27;s parliamentary group voted in favour of Denmark&#x27;s participation in the United Nations-sanctioned military action in Libya on the basis that it was a humanitarian action. However, the decision led to significant backlash, and the party&#x27;s support was pulled back after the military intervention began.

== History ==

The party was formed in 1989 as an electoral alliance of three left-wing parties: Left Socialists (VS), Communist Party of Denmark (DKP), and Socialist Workers Party (SAP). Originally the plan was to unite these parties alongside The Greens (De Grønne), Common Course, and Humanist to form a broad-based progressive movement, but this did not materialize. A fourth party, the Communist Workers Party (KAP), succeeded in joining the alliance in 1991, but its involvement was vetoed a year later by DKP.

Prior to the 2007 Danish general election, the party enlisted Asmaa Abdol-Hamid, a Danish Muslim candidate who identified herself as a feminist, democrat, and socialist. She is endorsed by some imams, opposed by others (including those in Hizb ut-Tahrir, a fundamentalist organization). She wears a hijab and does not shake hands with men. These facts, and some of her statements regarding politics and religion, made her the target of some criticism across the political spectrum, particularly from the Danish People&#x27;s Party. Some left-wing figures cited her candidacy as a reason for withdrawing their support from the party. An anti-religious network was created within the party with the stated goal of turning the party into a solely atheist party with a materialist–Marxist basis.

During the campaign, there was some speculation as to whether her candidacy would attract or repel voters. The results of the election were 2.2% for the party, down from 3.4% in the 2005 Danish general election. Although not elected, Abdol-Hamid maintained that she had attracted voters to the party. The four seats won by the party went to Frank Aaen, Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen, Line Barfod, and Per Clausen.

In the 2011 Danish general election, the party received 6.7% of the vote and tripled its representation from 4 seats to 12 seats.

The party contested the 2013 local elections on a platform of improving public transport and making greater public investment.

As part of the left-leaning &quot;Red bloc&quot; coalition with the Social Democrats, the Red–Green Alliance accepted the government budget twice and was in opposition twice in the period from 2011 to 2015. But at no point did they report direct opposition to the government. In the 2015 general election, the party received 7.8% of the vote and increased its representation from 12 to 14 seats.

== Organization ==

=== Leadership ===
The party is the only one in the Folketing which does not have an official party leader, instead having collective leadership. However, since 2009 it has had a political spokesperson, who has served as the party&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; representative, and serves as its leader in party leader debates.

==== List of political spokespersons ====
* Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen (2009–2016)

=== Membership ===
==Electoral performance==

===Parliament===
Red–Green Alliance tends to have a higher vote share in large urban areas, and especially in Copenhagen Municipality. In the 2022 Danish general election, it became the largest party in 4 nomination districts of the municipality, namely Inner City, Nørrebro, Bispebjerg and Vesterbro. The party is much more weakly positioned in rural parts of Denmark, having received only 2.9% of the vote outside the municipalities of the three largest cities. 

===Local elections===
===European Parliament===
Prior to 2016, the Red–Green Alliance never directly contested elections to the European Parliament, preferring to support the People&#x27;s Movement against the EU, the Eurosceptic party sits in The Left in the European Parliament – GUE/NGL group now. Some of the party&#x27;s MPs considered running an independent list for the 2014 elections, but this idea was dismissed by a majority in the party&#x27;s yearly meeting.

In a historic decision in the party&#x27;s yearly meeting in May 2016, a majority decided to directly contest the 2019 European Parliament election.

The 2024-2029 MEP is Per Clausen.

<doc id="662861" wikidata="Q974845" url="?curid=662861" title="Constitution Day (Norway)">
<text>Constitution Day is the national day of Norway and is an official public holiday observed on 17 May each year. Among Norwegians, the day is referred to as Syttende mai (&quot;Seventeenth of May&quot;), &quot;Nasjonaldagen&quot; (&quot;National Day&quot;), or &quot;Grunnlovsdagen&quot; (&quot;Constitution Day&quot;), although the latter is less frequent.

The Norwegians will often celebrate with big parades with everyone dressed up in their special outfit (bunad). People eat hot dogs, waffles and ice cream and the children play playground games.

== Historical background ==
The Constitution of Norway was signed at Eidsvoll on 17 May 1814. It is the second oldest written constitution still in use. The constitution declared Norway to be an independent kingdom in an attempt to avoid being ceded to Sweden after Denmark–Norway&#x27;s devastating defeat in the Napoleonic Wars. This established a Union between Sweden and Norway.

The celebration of this day began spontaneously among students and others from early on. However, Norway was at that time in a personal union with Sweden (following the Convention of Moss in August 1814, by which they shared a monarch as separate nations) and for some years the King of Sweden and Norway was reluctant to allow the celebrations. For a few years during the 1820s, King Charles XIV John actually banned it, believing that celebrations like this were, in fact, a kind of protest and disregard, even revolt, against the union. The king&#x27;s attitude changed after the Battle of the Square in 1829, an incident which resulted in such a commotion that the king had to allow commemorations on the day.

It was, however, not until 1833 that public addresses were held, and official celebration was initiated near the monument of former government minister Christian Krohg, who had spent much of his political life curbing the personal power of the monarch. The address was held by Henrik Wergeland, thoroughly witnessed and accounted for by an informant dispatched by the king himself.

After 1864 the day became more established when the first children&#x27;s parade was launched in Christiania, at first consisting only of boys. This initiative was taken by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, although Wergeland made the first known children&#x27;s parade at Eidsvoll around 1820. It was only in 1899 that girls were allowed to join in the parade for the first time. In 1905, the union with Sweden was dissolved and Prince Carl of Denmark was chosen to be King of an independent Norway, under the name Haakon VII. Obviously, this ended any Swedish concern for the activities of the National Day.

During World War II when Norway was under occupation by the Nazis, it was strictly forbidden for Norwegians to celebrate 17 May, participate in any procession, or to use the colors of the Norwegian flag on clothes. At the liberation on 8 May 1945, the Norwegian flag therefore became a strong symbol of Norway&#x27;s freedom.

By historical coincidence, World War II ended in Norway nine days before Constitution Day on 8 May 1945, when the occupying German forces surrendered. Even if Liberation Day is an official flag day in Norway, the day is not an official holiday and not widely celebrated. Instead, a new and broader meaning has been added to the celebration of Norwegian Constitution Day on 17 May to reflect the victory over Nazi oppression.

==Children&#x27;s parades==

A noteworthy aspect of the Norwegian Constitution Day is its very non-military nature. All over Norway, children&#x27;s parades with an abundance of flags form the central elements of the celebration. Each elementary school district arranges its own parade with marching bands between schools. The parade takes the children through the community, often making stops at homes of senior citizens, war memorials, etc. The longest parade is in Oslo, where some 100,000 people travel to the city centre to participate in the main festivities. This is broadcast on TV every year, with comments on costumes, banners, etc., together with local reports from celebrations around the country. The massive Oslo parade includes some 100 schools, marching bands, and passes the royal palace where the royal family greet the people from the main balcony.

Typically, a school&#x27;s children parade will consist of some senior school children carrying the school&#x27;s official banner, followed by a handful of other older children carrying full-size Norwegian flags, and the school&#x27;s marching band. After the band, the rest of the school children follow with hand-held flags, often with the junior forms first, and often behind self-made banners for each form or even individual class. Nearby kindergartens may also have been invited to join in. As the parade passes, bystanders often join in behind the official parade and follow the parade back to the school.

Depending on the community, the parade may make stops at particular sites along the route, such as a nursing home or war memorial. In Oslo, the parade stops at the Royal Palace while Skaugum, the home of the crown prince, has been a traditional waypoint for parades in Asker.

During the parade, a marching band will play and the children will sing lyrics about the celebration of the National Day. The parade concludes with the stationary singing of the national anthem &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; (typically verses 1, 7 and 8), and the royal anthem &quot;Kongesangen&quot;.

In addition to flags, people typically wear red, white and blue ribbons. Although a long-standing tradition, it has lately become more popular for men, women and children to wear traditional outfits, called &quot;bunad&quot;. The children shout &quot;Hurra!&quot;, sing, blow whistles and shake rattles.

==Additional celebration==
All over Norway, memorials to the fallen at wars and to other notable national people are honoured with speeches and wreaths early in the morning. In many places (like in Oslo) at noon, a salute is fired.

In addition to children&#x27;s parades, there are parades for the public (&quot;borgertog&quot;), where every citizen is welcome to join in. These are led by marching bands and often local boy scouts and girl guides, local choirs, NGOs etc. This takes place in the early morning or in the afternoon, before or after the school&#x27;s parade.

All parades begin or end with speeches. Both grown-ups and older children are invited to speak. After the parades, there are games for the children, and often much ice cream, pop, sweets and hot-dogs are consumed.

==Russ==
The graduating class from videregående (upper secondary school, sixth form) the Norwegian equivalent of high school, known as russ, has its own celebration on 17 May, staying up all night and making the rounds through the community. The russ also have their own parades later in the day, usually around 4 or 5 pm. In this parade, russ will parade through the street carrying signs and pickets. They may parody various local and political aspects, although recently this has become less frequent. Russ parades have lately become smaller and smaller due to diligent police discouragement.

==Celebration across the country==
The Constitution Day is celebrated in most small settlements and larger towns across Norway, with many variations.
*In the nation&#x27;s capital city, Oslo, children from most of the local schools gather to parade past the Royal Palace, where they and the royal family exchange waves and greetings.
*In the municipality of Asker, outside Oslo, the children gather outside the residence of the Crown Prince and Princess at Skaugum Estate in the morning (giving the Crown Prince and his family time to attend the parade in Oslo later in the day).
*Bergen has its own traditions for the parade, including comic troupes, various local organisations, a children&#x27;s parade, and the unique buekorps.
*In Trondheim, children from all the city&#x27;s schools parade the streets of Trondheim in the morning. Later in the afternoon, the &quot;Citizens Parade&quot; (Borgertoget) starts. This is a parade where firefighters, sports teams, students associations and other associations are represented.
*In Stavanger the day starts with a salute at 7 am. Later there are Children&#x27;s Parade, Russ Parade and finally Citizens Parade. The British school has, since the 1970s, and later copied by the Dutch school and the American school, carried flags from a number of countries from all over the world. An international party day is also arranged in the central Bjerkstedparken every 17 May.
*In Kristiansand, in addition to parades of schoolchildren and citizens earlier that day, the city is known for the conclusion of the National Day with running through the city centre (&quot;Tapto&quot;) and a spectacular fireworks display. For those who want to continue the party until midnight, a trad jazz band with local touches plays until midnight in front of the Christiansholm Fortress (Free entrance).

In addition to the children&#x27;s parades the streets across the country are filled with young and old, turning out in festive attire, and vendors selling ice cream, hot dogs, and more recently, kebabs.

In many neighbourhoods, small towns and villages, it is common for them to have their own events with relaxed open dining and fun, unpretentious competitions for children.

Although 17 May is the National Day, foreigners are very welcome to join in with all activities.

==Celebration abroad==

Syttende Mai is also celebrated in many Norwegian migrant communities throughout the world, with traditional foods, sometimes including lutefisk. In the United States and Canada, the local lodges of the Sons of Norway often play a central part in organizing the festivities.

The Bay Ridge neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City has had an annual 17 May Parade and celebration since 1952. It is well-attended and celebrated by Norwegian-Americans who immigrated to Brooklyn in the early 20th century.

One major celebration occurs in Petersburg, Alaska, also known as &quot;Little Norway&quot;. The town is a Norwegian settlement and strongly retains its roots. The festival occurs the weekend closest to 17 May and includes a parade, Leikarring dancers, herring toss, Norwegian pastries such as lefse and even a pack of Vikings and Valkyries.

Another major Syttende Mai celebration occurs in Stoughton, Wisconsin, which, along with Seattle, Washington, claims to be the 2nd largest in the world, and the largest in the US. Festivities include canoe racing, two parades, an art fair, a 20-mile run around the Stoughton community, and a great deal of bratwurst consumption. The festival features the Stoughton High School Norwegian Dancers, a group that tours the country showcasing traditional ethnic dances of Scandinavia.

Smaller Syttende Mai celebrations are held in Norwegian-heritage communities throughout western Wisconsin, Minnesota, and elsewhere in the Midwestern United States. Members of Norway&#x27;s Parliament Storting travel to Chicago to attend a three-day celebration consisting of a concert, banquet and parade hosted by the Norwegian National League. Spring Grove, Minnesota, also hosts a 3-day festival on the weekend nearest to Syttende Mai, while nearby Decorah, Iowa, the home of Nordic Fest and the Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum, also hosts a parade. Syttende Mai is also celebrated in Oswego, New York. Since 1969, the city of Westby, Wisconsin, has celebrated a four-day festival featuring authentic Norwegian foods, crafts, a &quot;frokost&quot; and Norwegian church service.

Other large celebrations are held in the Ballard, Seattle, which also claims to be the largest Syttende Mai parade outside of Oslo, Poulsbo, Washington, and Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Epcot&#x27;s Norwegian Pavilion in Florida, celebrates Constitution Day with numerous flags around the pavilion, as well as parades around the World Showcase Lagoon. Salt Lake City, Utah, holds its annual celebration at the International Peace Gardens. 400-700 people attend each year.

In the United Kingdom, the Norwegian community in London holds a 17 May celebration each year in Southwark Park. The celebration is attended by a large number of Norwegians resident in London and includes a parade, a traditional service in a local church, and the selling of traditional Norwegian foods such as &quot;Solo&quot; and &quot;makrell i tomat&quot;, and many Norwegian flags for Norwegians who have left theirs at home.

The Norwegian church in Cardiff celebrates Syttende Mai with a parade and a speech about the history of Syttende Mai and then a meal of tasty waffles.

In Orkney, Scotland, 17 May is celebrated by the Orkney Norway Friendship Association in recognition of the islands&#x27; strong historic links with Norway, with similar celebrations taking place in neighbouring Shetland.

In Glasgow, Scotland, 17 May is celebrated at Murano Street Student Village where Norwegian students and their friends congregate to enjoy the traditional festivities of the day. This includes the wearing of Norwegian traditional colours as well as the consumption of spectacularly copious amounts of alcoholic beverages.

Stockholm, Sweden, has a big celebration with a parade starting at Engelbrektsplan and ending at Skansen, in which more than 10,000 participate every year. The event includes Stockholm&#x27;s only dedicated 17 May marching band, Det Norske Korps.

It is also common for Norwegians living abroad to gather and celebrate. In some countries, typically where the population of Norwegian expatriates is small, the Norwegian embassy is the focus of celebrations, or sometimes the diplomats&#x27; spouses arrange an event.

In New Zealand, the 17th of May is celebrated in Fiordland, a small piece of Norway in the fjords and mountains of southwest New Zealand. All Fjordland buildings are made of eucalyptus and are inspired by Norwegian architecture. They have an exposition of photos and facts about Norway, typical food, and a presentation with six Fjord Horses making a choreography with Norwegian music Vi på Langedrag by Sigmund Groven.

Norsewood in New Zealand also Celebrates Norway Day with a church service, folk dancing displays by school children and Norwegian songs performed by the village choir.
==Henrik Wergeland==
The poet Henrik Wergeland is credited with making &quot;Søttende/Syttende mai&quot; a celebratory day for the children rather than a day of patriotic pride. Actually, the day demonstrates that the children, i.e. the country&#x27;s future, &quot;are&quot; the patriotic pride, if we follow Wergeland&#x27;s thought. Flags and music dominate the day, and there are few military parades. To commemorate his contribution, the russ in Oslo place an oversized hat on his statue near the Storting (Parliament); the Jewish community place a wreath on his grave in the morning as a tribute to his efforts on their behalf.

==Military participation==

The day is celebrated as a people&#x27;s day, with limited military participation.

The Royal Guard performs on the main street of the capital city, Oslo. During the parade, the Guard display their drill and musical skills. The marching band of the Royal Guard also attend the children&#x27;s parade in central Oslo together with the schools&#x27; own marching bands, their black uniforms and impeccable drill being a very popular part of the Oslo parade.

Forsvarets Musikkorps Vestlandet (Norwegian Armed Forces&#x27; Music Corps Western Norway), followed by parts of the military defence is participating in the parade of Bergen.

==An inclusive holiday==
The former Norwegian president of parliament Jo Benkow noted that the day has increasingly become a celebration of Norway&#x27;s growing ethnic diversity.

Several factors have probably contributed to the inclusive nature of the celebration:
*The central position of the children&#x27;s parade, including all lower-level school children, and therefore also their parents in the celebration.
*The celebration is focused around local schools and their children&#x27;s parade.
*The children&#x27;s parade reaches outwards, trying to cover as many roads as possible in the local community.
*The low focus on elected government during the celebration. In the capital, for example, the children&#x27;s parade passes the left side of the parliament building, and the president of parliament is allowed to wave to the passing parade from a small balcony, but the main focus of the parade is the Royal Palace and the royal family. The office of president of parliament is mainly ceremonial and administrative, often awarded in the later part of a political career. The prime minister and the rest of the ruling government on the other hand have no official duties during the celebrations.
*The virtual lack of any military-centred celebration.

One can add that the day should be regarded as an expression of thankfulness, on behalf of the old values freedom, equality and brotherhood, the ideological basis for the constitution, and also on behalf of the circumstances that led up to the constitution. The aspect of &quot;thanksgiving&quot; in the national celebrations of Norway is easily forgotten in the long span of years from 1814.

There has been dispute over whether foreign flags should be allowed in the parade. In 2008, the 17 May committee of Oslo banned the use of foreign flags, but was overturned by the mayor of Oslo, Fabian Stang. Similar discussions have taken place in other cities. In 2013, the 17 May committee of Ålesund turned down a request from a local school to use handmade paper flags that also included foreign flags. The decision was later overturned.

<text>Olvera Street, commonly known by its Spanish name Calle Olvera, is a historic pedestrian street in El Pueblo de Los Ángeles, the historic center of Los Angeles. The street is located off of the Plaza de Los Ángeles, the oldest plaza in California, which served as the center of the city life through the Spanish and Mexican eras into the early American era, following the Conquest of California. 

Restaurants, vendors, and public establishments line the street. Calle Olvera attracts almost two million visitors per year. The street is home to numerous of the oldest buildings in Los Angeles, include the Ávila Adobe, the oldest standing residence in Los Angeles.

== Geography ==

Olvera Street is in the northeast of modern-day Downtown Los Angeles, between Main and Alameda streets, running north from the Los Angeles Plaza to Cesar Chavez Avenue. It is part of El Pueblo de Los Ángeles Historical Monument, the area immediately around the Plaza. This is west of Union Station and southeast of Chinatown. Though Los Angeles was founded in 1781, this Plaza dates to the 1820s, and is approximately a block east and south of the original 18th-century Plaza.

==History==
The street has variously been known as &quot;Placita Olvera&quot;, &quot;Calle de los Vignes&quot;, Vine Street, and Wine Street.

===Early days===
Los Angeles was founded in 1781 by Spanish &quot;pobladores&quot; (settlers), on a site southeast of today&#x27;s Olvera Street near the Los Angeles River. They consisted of 11 families—44 men, women, and children — and were accompanied by a few Spanish soldiers. They had come from nearby Mission San Gabriel Arcángel to establish a secular pueblo on the banks of the Porciúncula River at the Indian village of &quot;Yaanga&quot;. Of the 44 original pobladores [colonists] who founded Los Angeles, only two were white, […] Of the other 42, 26 had some degree of African ancestry and 16 were Indians or mestizos [people of mixed Spanish and Indian blood]. — William M. Mason, 1975 The new town was named El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Ángeles. Priests from San Gabriel established an &quot;asistencia&quot; (a sub-mission), the Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles Asistencia, to tend to their religious needs. The pueblo eventually built its own parish church, known today as the &quot;Old Plaza Church.&quot; The original 18th-century plaza was approximately a block north and west of the present one. Unpredictable flooding forced the settlers to abandon the original site and move to higher ground in the early 1800s, with the current Plaza at the center of the newly moved pueblo.

Spanish colonial rule lasted until Mexican independence in 1821. This period saw Los Angeles&#x27;s first streets and adobe buildings. During Mexican rule, which lasted twenty-six years, the Plaza was the heart of a vibrant ethnic Californio community life in Los Angeles and was the center of an economy based upon farming in the former flood plain, supplemented with cattle ranching.

The Pelanconi House was, in the second half of the 19th century, a winery producing wine from the grapes that grew there, and to this day still do. The DNA matches that of grapes at Mission San Gabriel, established in 1771.

After the Mexican War, the Plaza remained the center of town. A small alley branching off of the Plaza, Wine Street, had its name changed by City Council ordinance in 1877 to Olvera Street to honor Agustin Olvera, the first Superior Court Judge of Los Angeles County, who owned a no-longer-existing adobe house nearby. In the 1880s, the little town grew rapidly due to the influx of settlers from Southern States. These joined the Spaniards and earlier English-speaking settlers who had become voting citizens before 1846.

As the town expanded, the original area of settlement came to be neglected, and served as a neighborhood for new immigrants, especially Mexicans and Sicilians. It included a Chinese community, which eventually relocated to the present nearby Chinatown to make way for the construction of Union Station. During the 1920s, the pace of Mexican immigration increased rapidly. California was the primary destination, with Los Angeles being a common choice. As a part of a movement to preserve what was viewed as California&#x27;s &quot;authentic&quot; heritage, Christine Sterling began a public campaign to renovate the Francisco Avila Adobe, which evolved into a campaign to remake Olvera street as a modern Mexican-style market place.

===Preservation and restoration ===


Sterling&#x27;s efforts to rescue the area began in 1926, when she learned of a plan to demolish the Avila Adobe, the oldest existing home in the city. After raising the issue with the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, Sterling approached Harry Chandler, the publisher of the Los Angeles Times, with a plan to create a Mexican marketplace and cultural center in the Plaza. Chandler was intrigued by the idea of packaging the Plaza area that acknowledged the Mexican heritage of the city while presenting a romanticized ersatz version, an ethnic theme park. He helped by providing extensive publicity and supporting the development plan in &quot;The Times&quot;.

By 1928, due to a lack of financial support for implementing her ideas, the project appeared to be doomed. In late November, Sterling found a Los Angeles City Health Department Notice of Condemnation posted in front of the Avila Adobe. In response, she posted her own hand-painted sign condemning the shortsightedness of city bureaucrats in failing to preserve an important historic site. Her act helped attract additional public interest in preserving the old adobe. The Los Angeles City Council finally reversed its original order of condemnation. Support for restoring the adobe rushed in from throughout the city. Building materials came from several local companies, including Blue Diamond Cement and the Simmons Brick Company, one of the largest employers of Mexicans in the Los Angeles area. Los Angeles Police Chief James Davis provided a crew of prison inmates to do hard labor on the project. Sterling oversaw the construction project, and an excerpt from her diary vividly captures her spirit and sense of desperation for financial support during the construction: &quot;One of the prisoners is a good carpenter, another an electrician. Each night I pray they will arrest a bricklayer and a plumber.&quot;
In spite of ample supplies and forced volunteers, the project lacked solid financial backing until Chandler came forward with capital for the project through funds collected at $1,000-a-plate luncheons with selected businessmen. Chandler established and headed the Plaza de Los Angeles Corporation, a for-profit venture which became the financial basis for the restoration of Plaza-Olvera. The street was closed to automotive traffic in 1929.

On Easter Sunday 1930, Sterling&#x27;s romantic revival came to pass with the opening of Paseo de Los Angeles (which later became popularly known by its official street name Olvera Street). Touted as &quot;A Mexican Street of Yesterday in a City of Today&quot;, Olvera Street was an instant success as a tourist site. La Opinión, a leading Spanish-language daily, praised the project as &quot;una calleja que recuerda al México viejo&quot; (a street which recalls old Mexico).

==Events==

===Blessing of the Animals event===
The Blessing of the Animals at Olvera Street, an event dating to 1930, is held every Sábado de Gloria (Holy Saturday, the Saturday before Easter). The event was originally held in conjunction with the Feast Day of Saint Anthony of the Desert, but it was changed to take advantage of better weather. The original procession has grown into an all-day event with vendors, performers, and a procession where participants bring their animals to be blessed by religious authorities and others.

The event is held near the Biscailuz Building and is represented by a mural on its exterior, &quot;The Blessing of the Animals&quot;, by Leo Politi. The event is also the subject of a book by the same name&quot;.&quot;

==Landmarks==

=== Avila Adobe ===
The Avila Adobe at 10 Olvera Street was built in 1818 and is the oldest surviving residence in Los Angeles. It was built by Francisco Ávila, a wealthy cattle rancher. Its adobe walls are 2½ to thick. U. S. Navy Commodore Robert Stockton took it over as his temporary headquarters when the United States first occupied the city in 1846. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the adobe is also designated as California State Landmark No. 145. It was restored starting 1926 through efforts by Christine Sterling, and now stands as a museum.

=== Sepulveda House ===

The Sepulveda House at 12 Olvera Street is a historic residence built in 1887 by Señora Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda in the Eastlake architectural style. The original structure included two commercial businesses and three residences. It has since then become a preserved museum, and is cited by its website as a representation of the &quot;blending of Mexican and Anglo culture&quot;.

Eloisa Martínez de Sepúlveda was born in the state of Sonora in Mexico. She lived there until 1844 when her parents, Francisca Gallardo and Estaquio Martinez, moved to Alta California at the urging of Francisca’s brother, bringing the 11-year-old Eloisa and her older brother Luis, with them to Los Angeles.  In 1847, Señora Francisca Gallardo received from the ayuntamiento (Common Council) a plot of land between Bath and Wine street (renamed Olvera Street in 1877) on which she constructed an adobe residence. Señora Gallardo’s adobe home at number 12 Bath Street was later enlarged to include by 1870 a second story and hipped roof. When Eloisa married Joaquin Sepulveda at the age of 23, she brought with her a dowry of land and cattle. Joaquin was an undistinguished member of an illustrious Southern California family. The marriage suffered from misfortune as the couple’s only child died in infancy and Joaquin himself died in 1880 leaving no property. Señora Gallardo gave her property to her widowed daughter, Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda, in 1881. On lands owned by her mother, Eloisa was able to finance the construction of a commercial building which provided her with a steady income. This was the Sepulveda Block, built in 1887.

Señora Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda built the two-story Sepulveda Block in 1887 in response to the city’s real estate and population boom of the 1800s. The twenty-two room building cost $8,000 to erect. As her husband, Joaquin Sepulveda, had died seven years earlier leaving no estate, Señora Sepulveda probably financed the construction of the building on her own. By 1888 Bath Street had been renamed Main Street and the city had realigned and widened it, cutting off from the front of the adobe. Señora Sepulveda received $1,190 in compensation.

When the Sepulveda Block was built in 1887 Señora Eloisa Sepulveda kept a suite of three rooms for her own use. Her bedroom reveals much about her Mexican heritage and the popular tastes and styles of the time. It would also reflect some of the places in Los Angeles in the decades following her arrival from Sonora in 1844. The décor of the room shows a practical acceptance of modern technology and contemporary fashion, with its mass-produced walnut furniture and gaslight chandelier. The bedroom has three different wallpapers and a typical flowered carpet. The somewhat-cluttered appearance is characteristic of the period and a sign of modest prosperity. By contrast, the brass bed with its draperies and fancy spread, the Chinese shawl, and the well-tended shrine are representative of Señora Sepulveda’s Mexican upbringing and her strong religious beliefs. The large crucifix is on loan from Señora Sepulveda’s descendants while the bed belonged to the Avila family, who were related to her by marriage. The pastel portrait is of her favorite niece, Eloisa Martinez de Gibbs.

Señora Sepulveda chose American architects George F. Costerisan and William O. Merithew to design her two-story business block for residential and commercial rental in 1887. Although this particular type of building is probably unique in Los Angeles today, it was a “pattern book” building of a style that was common all over the country at the time. An exception in this building is the typically Mexican breezeway which separates the Main Street stores from the dwelling rooms in the rear. Thus, the Sepulveda Block represents the transition in Los Angeles from Mexican to a combination of Anglo and Mexican styles. The work “block” is the Victorian term for a large commercial building. By this time the city had changed from a Mexican pueblo with a cattle-based economy to an American town with an agricultural economy. The population had grown from less than 2,000, most of whom were Mexican, to over 50,000, only 19% of whom were Mexican. When the building was constructed it appears that Señora Sepulveda herself occupied the three residential rooms located in the rear, facing Olvera Street, then an unpaved alley. Later, she may have occupied other quarters. Commercial tenants were located in the stores fronting on Main Street while the second floor was used as a boarding house.

Señora Sepulveda bequeathed the building on her death in 1903 to her favorite niece and goddaughter, Eloisa Martinez de Gibbs. Edward Gibbs, an engineer and lumber company owner, had been a tenant in the Sepulveda Block. In 1888, the same year that he and Eloisa were married, Edward was elected to the City Council. Four of their five children were born in the second floor facing Main Street on the south side. In 1905, along with many other residents of the area, the Gibbs moved to a more fashionable neighborhood in Los Angeles. Succeeding generations of the Gibbs family operated the Gibbs Electrical Company and retained ownership of the Sepulveda Block until it was acquired by the State of California for $135,000 in 1958 as part of the Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Monument.

Between 1982 and 1984 major restoration took place in the Sepulveda Block. The building was structurally stabilized and plumbing, heating, air conditioning and electrical systems were installed. A new roof replaced the old one and the front staircase, which had been removed in the 1930s, was put back. The iron cresting is restored as are the red tin tiles over the bay windows. The west façade is “penciled” in the style of the period, meaning that the bricks are painted and mortar lines are traced in white on top. The east façade on Olvera Street, although not originally painted, had previously been sandblasted, a process which destroys the outer surface of the brick, making it porous. As paint provides bricks with protective coating, they have been painted with the color which was first used in 1919. A 1983 archeological excavation beneath the wooden floor unearthed artifacts relating to the building’s history. Peter Snell, partner with Long Hoeft Architects and Gus Duffy Architect, were the firms responsible for the Sepulveda Block restoration plans and construction supervision.

During World War II the Sepulveda Block became a canteen for servicemen and three Olvera Street merchants were located in the building. The building continued to be used by Olvera Street merchants until 1981 when they were relocated for the building’s restoration. Today, El Pueblo Park’s Visitor’s Center is located in the south store on the ground floor. This room represents the Victorian Eastlake style of 1890. Restoration plans call for the creation of an 1890s grocery store on the north side of the first floor.

=== Mural &quot;América Tropical&quot; ===
The mural &quot;América Tropical&quot; (full name: &quot;América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos&quot;, or &quot;Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism&quot;,) by David Siqueiros, was unveiled above the street in 1932. It was soon covered up to mask its political content. The Getty Conservation Institute has performed detailed conservation work on the mural to restore it and the America Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access.

=== Plaza Substation ===
The Plaza Substation, also at 10 Olvera Street, was part of the electric streetcar system operated by the Los Angeles Railway. Completed in 1904, the substation provided electricity to power the yellow streetcars. When the streetcar system closed in the 1940s, the building was converted to other uses. The substation is one of the two buildings in the district that is separately listed in the National Register of Historic Places (the Avila Adobe is the other).

=== Pelanconi House ===
Pelanconi House at 17 Olvera Street, built in the 1850s, is the oldest surviving brick house in Los Angeles. In 1924, it was converted into a restaurant called &quot;La Golondrina&quot;, which was the oldest restaurant on Olvera Street until its closure in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pelanconi House was a winery producing wine from the grapes that grew in the area, possibly even inside the Avila Adobe where they grow currently. The DNA matches that of grapes at Mission San Gabriel, established in 1771.

=== Plaza Methodist Church ===
Built in 1926, the Plaza Methodist Church was built on the site of the adobe once owned by Agustín Olvera, the man for whom Olvera Street was named. It is at the southeast corner of Olvera Street and Paseo de la Plaza (i.e. the Plaza).

=== Eugene Biscailuz Building ===
The former United Methodist Church headquarters, also built in 1926, was renamed in 1965 for Sheriff Eugene W. Biscailuz, who had helped Christine Sterling to preserve and transform Olvera Street. It housed the Mexican Consulate until 1991 and then the Mexican Cultural Institute.

==Reception==

The American Planning Association named Olvera Street one of the top five &quot;Great Streets&quot; in the United States for 2015.

Some find Olvera Street to be a sanitized fabrication of Latin American culture merely to attract tourists, a &quot;fake&quot; Mexican presence; since 1926, it has garnered controversy as historians and collectors have attempted to preserve the sites for historic study and educational purposes. In contrast, there are researchers that often cite that Olvera Street is an &quot;appropriated&quot; misnomer of Latin-American and Hispanic culture, and should therefore not remain as a source of tourism. Even critics though, have acknowledged how the city fathers were ready to condemn and destroy the area in the 1920s. The attention brought to the area shamed the city into saving its heritage and preserving some of the original adobe buildings. This tension around an idealized cultural image is evident in the mural &quot;América Tropical&quot; (full name: &quot;América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos&quot;, or &quot;Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism&quot;) by David Siqueiros which was slated to be an exciting addition to the street until it was actually unveiled in 1932. The Getty Conservation Institute began performing detailed conservation work on the mural in 2010 and the America Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access in 2012.

==In popular culture==
*William M. Pizor produced a narrated travelogue short film about the street in 1937 titled &quot;A Street of Memory&quot;. It is extant.

* &quot;Golondrina&quot;, an opera by Lindsey C. Harnsberger was composed in 2015 to a libretto by Robert Cartland. The opera, originally titled &quot;Olvera Street,&quot; was premiered by Vineyard Touring Opera Company (VTO) in November 2017 in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and South Pasadena, California. It was revised and retitled in 2017 for April and May performances by VTO in Glendale and South Pasadena, California. The story of the opera is based on Christine Sterling&#x27;s fight to save the Avila Adobe and later restore Olvera Street.
* The plaza, before it was improved, can be seen in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s 1921 film &quot;The Kid&quot;, which featured a number of scenes of the west side of the plaza a few doors north of the Pelanconi House.
* The 4th book in the Robin Kane series by Eileen Hill has the mystery take place almost entirely on Olvera Street.

<text>A mobile device or handheld device is an electronic device small enough to hold and operate in hand. Mobile devices are typically battery-powered and possess a flat-panel display and one or more built-in input devices, such as a touchscreen or keypad. Modern mobile devices often emphasize wireless networking, to both the Internet and to other devices in their vicinity, such as headsets or in-car entertainment systems, via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, or near-field communication.

==Characteristics==
Device mobility can be viewed in the context of several qualities:
* Physical dimensions and weight
* Whether the device is mobile or some kind of host to which it is attached is mobile
* What kind of host devices it can be bound with
* How devices communicate with a host
* When mobility occurs

Strictly speaking, many so-called mobile devices are not mobile. It is the host that is mobile, i.e., a mobile human host carries a non-mobile smartphone device. An example of a true mobile computing device, where the device itself is mobile, is a robot. Another example is an autonomous vehicle.

There are three basic ways mobile devices can be physically bound to mobile hosts:

* Accompanied,
* Surface-mounted, or
* Embedded into the fabric of a host, e.g., an embedded controller in a host device.

Accompanied refers to an object being loosely bound and accompanying a mobile host, e.g., a smartphone can be carried in a bag or pocket but can easily be misplaced. Hence, mobile hosts with embedded devices such as an autonomous vehicle can appear larger than pocket-sized.

The most common size of a mobile computing device is pocket-sized, but other sizes for mobile devices exist. Mark Weiser, known as the father of ubiquitous computing, referred to device sizes that are tab-sized, pad, and board sized, where &quot;tabs&quot; are defined as accompanied or wearable centimeter-sized devices, e.g. smartphones, phablets and tablets are defined as hand-held decimeter-sized devices. If one changes the form of the mobile devices in terms of being non-planar, one can also have skin devices and tiny dust-sized devices.

&quot;Dust&quot; refers to miniaturized devices without direct HCI interfaces, e.g., micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), ranging from nanometers through micrometers to millimeters. See also Smart dust. &quot;Skin&quot;: fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices. These can be formed into more flexible non-planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains, see OLED display. Also, see smart device.

Although mobility is often regarded as synonymous with having wireless connectivity, these terms are different. Not all network access by mobile users, applications, and devices needs to be via wireless networks and vice versa. Wireless access devices can be static and mobile users can move between wired and wireless hotspots such as in Internet cafés. Some mobile devices can be used as mobile Internet devices to access the Internet while moving, but they do not need to do this and many phone functions or applications are still operational even while disconnected from the Internet.

What makes the mobile device unique compared to other technologies is the inherent flexibility in the hardware and software. Flexible applications include video chat, web browsing, payment systems, near field communication, audio recording etc. As mobile devices become ubiquitous, there will be an increase of services which include the use of the cloud. Although a common form of mobile device, a smartphone, has a display, another perhaps even more common form of smart computing device, the smart card, e.g., used as a bank card or travel card, does not have a display. This mobile device often has a CPU and memory but needs to connect or be inserted into a reader to display its internal data or state.

==History==
The history of the mobile device has been marked by increasing technological convergence. Early mobile devices—such as pocket calculators, portable media players, satellite navigation devices, and digital cameras—excelled at their intended use but were not multifaceted. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) proliferated in the 1990s as a way to quickly write down notes, schedule business appointments, and set personal reminders, as a handheld supplement to bulkier laptops.

During the same period, the mobile phone evolved from supporting voice communication only to accommodating text messaging, Internet connectivity, multimedia, and videotelephony. These feature phones eventually gave way to the modern smartphone, which combined all the aforementioned devices, and more, into one device. Since the late 2000s, smartphones have been the most common mobile device in the world, in terms of quantity sold, owing to their great convergence of technologies.

==Uses==

By the early 2010s, mobile devices began integrating sensors such as accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes, allowing the detection of orientation and motion. Mobile devices may provide biometric user authentication, such as face recognition or fingerprint recognition.

Handheld devices such as enterprise digital assistants have become more rugged for use in mobile field management. This involves tasks such as digitizing notes, sending and receiving invoices, asset management, recording signatures, managing parts, and scanning barcodes and RFID tags.

In 2009, developments in mobile collaboration systems enabled the use of handheld devices that combine video, audio, and on-screen drawing capabilities to enable multi-party conferencing in real-time, independent of location. Handheld computers are available in a variety of form factors, including smartphones, handheld PDAs, ultra-mobile PCs and tablet computers (Palm OS, WebOS). Users can watch television through the Internet by IPTV on some mobile devices. Mobile television receivers have existed since 1960, and, in the 21st-century, mobile phone providers began making television available on cellular phones.

In the 2010s, mobile devices were observed to frequently include the ability to sync and share a variety of data despite the distance or specifications of the devices. In the medical field, mobile devices are quickly becoming essential tools for accessing clinical information such as drugs, treatment, and even medical calculations. Due to the popularity of mobile gaming, the gambling industry started offering casino games on mobile devices, which led to the inclusion of these devices in the anti-hazard legislature as devices that could potentially be used for illegal gambling. Additional potentially unlawful actions could encompass the utilization of mobile devices in disseminating explicit material involving minors. Moreover, the legitimate adult entertainment sector&#x27;s incorporation of mobile apps and technology to advance its operations raises concerns. There is also a prospect of leveraging mobile devices to facilitate cross-border services, warranting regulatory attention.

Within the military domain, mobile devices have introduced novel prospects for delivering training and educational resources to soldiers, irrespective of their stationed location.

<text>Modern Screen was an American fan magazine published between 1930 and 1985 that featured articles, pictorials and interviews with film stars (and later television and music personalities).
== Founding ==

&quot;Modern Screen&quot; magazine debuted on November 3, 1930. Founded by the Dell Company of New York City it initially sold for 10 cents. &quot;Modern Screen&quot; quickly became popular and by 1933 it had become &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine&#x27;s main competition. It began to brag on its cover that it had &quot;The Largest Circulation of Any Screen Magazine&quot;, and Jean Harlow is seen reading a copy of &quot;Modern Screen&quot; in the 1933 film &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;.

During the early 1930s, the magazine featured artwork portraits of film stars on the cover. By 1940 it featured natural color photographs of the stars and was charging 15 cents per issue.

&quot;Modern Screen&quot; had many different editors in chief over the years, including Richard Heller, who understood the importance of the fan magazine&#x27;s contribution to movie sales and Mark Bego, the latter of whom edited the book &quot;The Best of Modern Screen&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 1986). The editor most associated with the magazine, however, was Regina Cannon (1900–1992), but her standards for publication were so low that Carl F. Cotter, who wrote &#x27;Forty Hacks of the Fan Mags&#x27; (&quot;The Coast&quot;, 1939), declared her stories to be the worst of the entire lot.

Contributors to the magazine included famed photographer George Hurrell and famed writers like Faith Baldwin. Louella Parsons wrote a column entitled &quot;Good News.&quot;

==Decline of the magazine==

&quot;Modern Screen&quot; remained a major success through the 1950s but a downturn in movie ticket sales at the end of the decade led to a general sales decline in the magazine. Still &quot; Modern Screen&quot; managed to remain popular. On January 3, 1967, &quot;The Film Daily&quot; declared that 50% of movie ticket sales were influenced by fan magazines such as &quot;Modern Screen&quot; and &quot;Photoplay&quot;. The magazine remained popular through the 1970s, and Lily Tomlin released her 1975 comedy album &quot;Modern Scream&quot;, a parody of celebrity magazines. In the early 1980s, however, the popularity of general interest celebrity publications like &quot;People Magazine&quot; proved to be the end of old-fashioned movie fan magazines. &quot;Modern Screen&quot; became a bimonthly magazine, but in 1985 publication of the magazine ceased.

== Legal issues ==

=== Troy Donahue lawsuit ===
On January 16, 1963, actor Troy Donahue filed a $200,000 lawsuit in Santa Monica against &quot;Modern Screen&quot;, Dell Publishing Co., and 17 year old Joyce Becker, a self-described actress and writer, who wrote an inflammatory article the magazine published titled, “The First Time Troy Made Love to Me.”

Donahue protested that the article described them as better friends than they really were.  His lawyer said they were only casually acquainted and had met only once, when Becker interviewed Donahue for a teen magazine. Donahue&#x27;s action claimed that the story violated privacy and said the statements in the article were “unjustified and untrue.”

Eventually, Dell Publishing Co. printed a retraction, and paid Donahue an undisclosed settlement.

<text>Richard Jupp (1728 – 17 April 1799) was an 18th-century English architect, particularly associated with buildings in and around London. He served for many years (c. 1755 – 1799) as surveyor to the British East India Company.

== Works ==
His work included:
* alterations to St Matthias Old Church, Poplar, London (1755)

<text>Maureen Caird (born 29 September 1951) is an Australian former track athlete, who specialised in the sprint hurdles. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, she became the youngest-ever individual Olympic athletics champion at the time, at age 17, when she won gold in Mexico City.

==Early career==
Born in Cumberland, New South Wales, Caird began competing in athletics as a teenager, trained by the former coach of quadruple Olympic champion Betty Cuthbert, June Ferguson.

Caird competed in several events, but the 80 m hurdles was her best. In 1967 she won both the junior (under 18) 80 metre hurdles and pentathlon at the Australian Championships.

In the 1968 Championships, she defended her junior hurdles crown and also won the Long Jump. Caird also competed in senior events, placing second in both the 80 metres and 100 metres hurdles behind Pam Kilborn who was rated as the world&#x27;s best female hurdler.

Caird&#x27;s performances earned her selection in the Australian team to compete at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

==International career==
At the Games, Caird, only 17 at the time, was the youngest member of the Australian team.Competition was very strong with defending champion Karin Balzer(East Germany)and World record holder Vera Korsakova (10.2 hand timed) from the USSR. Soon to be superstar Chi Cheng from Taiwan was also in this race. Both Maureen and her rival Pamela Kilborn made the final, which was held in wet conditions. To the surprise of most observers, Maureen crossed the line just .07secs ahead of her fellow Australian, in a new electronic world record time of 10.39. This upset made Maureen Caird the youngest individual Olympic champion in athletics (at the time, that record was broken by Ulrike Meyfarth in 1972) and earned her the world number one ranking. Because this was the last time the 80m event was contested, Maureen&#x27;s Olympic record will last forever.

At the 1970 Commonwealth Games, she finished second behind Kilborn in the 100 m hurdles(which had replaced the 80 m internationally)—this was despite suffering from glandular fever during the event.
Prior to these Games Maureen had won the 1970 Australian titles in both the 100m and 200m hurdles,defeating Pamela Kilborn and setting world records in the latter on 2 occasions.

Her attempt to defend her Olympic title in 1972 was unsuccessful and she did not make it past the heats. Maureen ran the first leg for Australia in the 4x100m relay and they finished 6th in the final.
Maureen Caird retired due to stomach pains that were later diagnosed as cancer.

==Personal life==
Caird, now married as Maureen Jones, currently lives in Australia.

==Honours==
Caird was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2000, she received an Australian Sports Medal.

<doc id="662889" wikidata="Q2427787" url="?curid=662889" title="Persistent data structure">
<text>In computing, a persistent data structure or not ephemeral data structure is a data structure that always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure. The term was introduced in Driscoll, Sarnak, Sleator, and Tarjan&#x27;s 1986 article.

A data structure is partially persistent if all versions can be accessed but only the newest version can be modified. The data structure is fully persistent if every version can be both accessed and modified. If there is also a meld or merge operation that can create a new version from two previous versions, the data structure is called confluently persistent. Structures that are not persistent are called &quot;ephemeral&quot;.

These types of data structures are particularly common in logical and functional programming, as languages in those paradigms discourage (or fully forbid) the use of mutable data.

==Partial versus full persistence==
In the partial persistence model, a programmer may query any previous version of a data structure, but may only update the latest version. This implies a linear ordering among each version of the data structure. In the fully persistent model, both updates and queries are allowed on any version of the data structure. In some cases the performance characteristics of querying or updating older versions of a data structure may be allowed to degrade, as is true with the rope data structure. In addition, a data structure can be referred to as confluently persistent if, in addition to being fully persistent, two versions of the same data structure can be combined to form a new version which is still fully persistent.

== Partially persistent data structure ==
A type of data structure where user may query any version of the structure but may only update the latest version.

An ephemeral data structure can be converted to partially persistent data structure using a few techniques.

One of the technique is by using randomized version of Van Emde Boas Tree which is created using dynamic perfect hashing. This data structure is created as follows:

* A stratified tree with m elements is implemented using dynamic perfect hashing.
* The tree is pruned by dividing the m elements into buckets of size log(log n) such that the elements of bucket 1 is smaller than the elements of bucket 2 and so on.
* The maximal element in each bucket is stored in the stratified tree and each bucket is stored in the structure as an unordered linked list.

The size of this data structure is bounded by the number of elements stored in the structure that is O(m). The insertion of a new maximal element is done in constant O(1) expected and amortized time. Finally query to find an element can be done in this structure in O(log(log n)) worst-case time.

==Techniques for preserving previous versions==

=== Copy-on-write ===
One method for creating a persistent data structure is to use a platform provided ephemeral data structure such as an array to store the data in the data structure and copy the entirety of that data structure using copy-on-write semantics for any updates to the data structure. This is an inefficient technique because the entire backing data structure must be copied for each write, leading to worst case O(n·m) performance characteristics for m modifications of an array of size n.

===Fat node===
The fat node method is to record all changes made to node fields in the nodes themselves, without erasing old values of the fields. This requires that nodes be allowed to become arbitrarily “fat”. In other words, each fat node contains the same information and pointer fields as an ephemeral node, along with space for an arbitrary number of extra field values. Each extra field value has an associated field name and a version stamp which indicates the version in which the named field was changed to have the specified value. Besides, each fat node has its own version stamp, indicating the version in which the node was created. The only purpose of nodes having version stamps is to make sure that each node only contains one value per field name per version. In order to navigate through the structure, each original field value in a node has a version stamp of zero.

====Complexity of fat node====
With using fat node method, it requires O(1) space for every modification: just store the new data. Each modification takes O(1) additional time to store the modification at the end of the modification history. This is an amortized time bound, assuming modification history is stored in a growable array. At access time, the right version at each node must be found as the structure is traversed. If &quot;m&quot; modifications were to be made, then each access operation would have O(log m) slowdown resulting from the cost of finding the nearest modification in the array.

===Path copying===
With the path copying method a copy of all nodes is made on the path to any node which is about to be modified. These changes must then be cascaded back through the data structure: all nodes that pointed to the old node must be modified to point to the new node instead. These modifications cause more cascading changes, and so on, until the root node is reached.

====Complexity of path copying====
With m modifications, this costs O(log m) additive lookup time. Modification time and space are bounded by the size of the longest path in the data structure and the cost of the update in the ephemeral data structure. In a Balanced Binary Search Tree without parent pointers the worst case modification time complexity is O(log n + update cost). However, in a linked list the worst case modification time complexity is O(n + update cost).

===A combination===
Driscoll, Sarnak, Sleator, Tarjan came up with a way to combine the techniques of fat nodes and path copying, achieving O(1) access slowdown and O(1) modification space and time complexity.

In each node, one modification box is stored. This box can hold one modification to the node—either a modification to one of the pointers, or to the node&#x27;s key, or to some other piece of node-specific data—and a timestamp for when that modification was applied. Initially, every node&#x27;s modification box is empty.

Whenever a node is accessed, the modification box is checked, and its timestamp is compared against the access time. (The access time specifies the version of the data structure being considered.) If the modification box is empty, or the access time is before the modification time, then the modification box is ignored and only the normal part of the node is considered. On the other hand, if the access time is after the modification time, then the value in the modification box is used, overriding that value in the node.

Modifying a node works like this. (It is assumed that each modification touches one pointer or similar field.) If the node&#x27;s modification box is empty, then it is filled with the modification. Otherwise, the modification box is full. A copy of the node is made, but using only the latest values. The modification is performed directly on the new node, without using the modification box. (One of the new node&#x27;s fields is overwritten and its modification box stays empty.) Finally, this change is cascaded to the node&#x27;s parent, just like path copying. (This may involve filling the parent&#x27;s modification box, or making a copy of the parent recursively. If the node has no parent—it&#x27;s the root—it is added the new root to a sorted array of roots.)

With this algorithm, given any time t, at most one modification box exists in the data structure with time t. Thus, a modification at time t splits the tree into three parts: one part contains the data from before time t, one part contains the data from after time t, and one part was unaffected by the modification.

====Complexity of the combination====
Time and space for modifications require amortized analysis. A modification takes O(1) amortized space, and O(1) amortized time. To see why, use a potential function ϕ, where ϕ(T) is the number of full live nodes in T . The live nodes of T are just the nodes that are reachable from the current root at the current time (that is, after the last modification). The full live nodes are the live nodes whose modification boxes are full.

Each modification involves some number of copies, say k, followed by 1 change to a modification box. Consider each of the k copies. Each costs O(1) space and time, but decreases the potential function by one. (First, the node to be copied must be full and live, so it contributes to the potential function. The potential function will only drop, however, if the old node isn&#x27;t reachable in the new tree. But it is known that it isn&#x27;t reachable in the new tree—the next step in the algorithm will be to modify the node&#x27;s parent to point at the copy. Finally, it is known that the copy&#x27;s modification box is empty. Thus, replaced a full live node has been replaced with an empty live node, and ϕ goes down by one.) The final step fills a modification box, which costs O(1) time and increases ϕ by one.

Putting it all together, the change in ϕ is Δϕ =1− k. Thus, the algorithm takes O(k +Δϕ)= O(1) space and O(k +Δϕ +1) = O(1) time

==Generalized form of persistence==
Path copying is one of the simple methods to achieve persistency in a certain data structure such as binary search trees. It is nice to have a general strategy for implementing persistence that works with any given data structure. In order to achieve that, we consider a directed graph . We assume that each vertex in has a constant number of outgoing edges that are represented by pointers. Each vertex has a label representing the data. We consider that a vertex has a bounded number of edges leading into it which we define as inedges(). We allow the following different operations on . 
* CREATE-NODE(): Creates a new vertex with no incoming or outgoing edges.
* CHANGE-EDGE(, , ): Changes the edge of to point to 
* CHANGE-LABEL(, ): Changes the value of the data stored at to 
Any of the above operations is performed at a specific time and the purpose of the persistent graph representation is to be able to access any version of at any given time. For this purpose we define a table for each vertex in . The table contains columns and formula_1 rows. Each row contains in addition to the pointers for the outgoing edges, a label which represents the data at the vertex and a time at which the operation was performed. In addition to that there is an array inedges() that keeps track of all the incoming edges to . When a table is full, a new table with formula_1 rows can be created. The old table becomes inactive and the new table becomes the active table.

===CREATE-NODE===
A call to CREATE-NODE creates a new table and set all the references to null

===CHANGE-EDGE===
If we assume that CHANGE-EDGE(, , ) is called, then there are two cases to consider. 
* There is an empty row in the table of the vertex : In this case we copy the last row in the table and we change the edge of vertex to point to the new vertex 
* Table of the vertex is full: In this case we need to create a new table. We copy the last row of the old table into the new table. We need to loop in the array inedges() in order to let each vertex in the array point to the new table created. In addition to that, we need to change the entry in the inedges(w) for every vertex such that edge exists in the graph .

===CHANGE-LABEL===
It works exactly the same as CHANGE-EDGE except that instead of changing the edge of the vertex, we change the label.

===Efficiency of the generalized persistent data structure===
In order to find the efficiency of the scheme proposed above, we use an argument defined as a credit scheme. The credit represents a currency. For example, the credit can be used to pay for a table. The argument states the following:
* The creation of one table requires one credit
* Each call to CREATE-NODE comes with two credits
* Each call to CHANGE-EDGE comes with one credit
The credit scheme should always satisfy the following invariant: Each row of each active table stores one credit and the table has the same number of credits as the number of rows. Let us confirm that the invariant applies to all the three operations CREATE-NODE, CHANGE-EDGE and CHANGE-LABEL.
*CREATE-NODE: It acquires two credits, one is used to create the table and the other is given to the one row that is added to the table. Thus the invariant is maintained.
*CHANGE-EDGE: There are two cases to consider. The first case occurs when there is still at least one empty row in the table. In this case one credit is used to the newly inserted row. The second case occurs when the table is full. In this case the old table becomes inactive and the formula_1 credits are transformed to the new table in addition to the one credit acquired from calling the CHANGE-EDGE. So in total we have formula_4 credits. One credit will be used for the creation of the new table. Another credit will be used for the new row added to the table and the credits left are used for updating the tables of the other vertices that need to point to the new table. We conclude that the invariant is maintained.
*CHANGE-LABEL: It works exactly the same as CHANGE-EDGE.
As a summary, we conclude that having formula_5 calls to CREATE_NODE and formula_6 calls to CHANGE_EDGE will result in the creation of formula_7 tables. Since each table has size formula_8 without taking into account the recursive calls, then filling in a table requires formula_9 where the additional d factor comes from updating the inedges at other nodes. Therefore, the amount of work required to complete a sequence of operations is bounded by the number of tables created multiplied by formula_9. Each access operation can be done in formula_11 and there are formula_12 edge and label operations, thus it requires formula_13. We conclude that There exists a data structure that can complete any formula_14 sequence of CREATE-NODE, CHANGE-EDGE and CHANGE-LABEL in formula_15.

==Applications of persistent data structures==
===Next element search or point location===
One of the useful applications that can be solved efficiently using persistence is the Next Element Search. Assume that there are formula_14 non intersecting line segments that don&#x27;t cross each other that are parallel to the x-axis. We want to build a data structure that can query a point formula_17 and return the segment above formula_17 (if any). We will start by solving the Next Element Search using the naïve method then we will show how to solve it using the persistent data structure method.

====Naïve method====
We start with a vertical line segment that starts off at infinity and we sweep the line segments from the left to the right. We take a pause every time we encounter an end point of these segments. The vertical lines split the plane into vertical strips. If there are formula_14 line segments then we can get formula_20 vertical strips since each segment has formula_21 end points. No segment begins and ends in the strip. Every segment either it doesn&#x27;t touch the strip or it completely crosses it. We can think of the segments as some objects that are in some sorted order from top to bottom. What we care about is where the point that we are looking at fits in this order. We sort the endpoints of the segments by their formula_22 coordinate. For each strip formula_23, we store the subset segments that cross formula_23 in a dictionary. When the vertical line sweeps the line segments, whenever it passes over the left endpoint of a segment then we add it to the dictionary. When it passes through the right endpoint of the segment, we remove it from the dictionary. At every endpoint, we save a copy of the dictionary and we store all the copies sorted by the formula_22 coordinates. Thus we have a data structure that can answer any query. In order to find the segment above a point formula_17, we can look at the formula_22 coordinate of formula_17 to know which copy or strip it belongs to. Then we can look at the formula_29 coordinate to find the segment above it. Thus we need two binary searches, one for the formula_22 coordinate to find the strip or the copy, and another for the formula_29 coordinate to find the segment above it. Thus the query time takes formula_32. In this data structure, the space is the issue since if we assume that we have the segments structured in a way such that every segment starts before the end of any other segment, then the space required for the structure to be built using the naïve method would be formula_33. Let us see how we can build another persistent data structure with the same query time but with a better space.

====Persistent data structure method====
We can notice that what really takes time in the data structure used in the naïve method is that whenever we move from a strip to the next, we need to take a snap shot of whatever data structure we are using to keep things in sorted order. We can notice that once we get the segments that intersect formula_23, when we move to formula_35 either one thing leaves or one thing enters. If the difference between what is in formula_23 and what is in formula_35 is only one insertion or deletion then it is not a good idea to copy everything from formula_23 to formula_35. The trick is that since each copy differs from the previous one by only one insertion or deletion, then we need to copy only the parts that change. Let us assume that we have a tree rooted at formula_40. When we insert a key formula_41 into the tree, we create a new leaf containing formula_41. Performing rotations to rebalance the tree will only modify the nodes of the path from formula_41 to formula_40. Before inserting the key formula_41 into the tree, we copy all the nodes on the path from formula_41 to formula_40. Now we have 2 versions of the tree, the original one which doesn&#x27;t contain formula_41 and the new tree that contains formula_41 and whose root is a copy of the root of formula_40. Since copying the path from formula_41 to formula_40 doesn&#x27;t increase the insertion time by more than a constant factor then the insertion in the persistent data structure takes formula_32 time. For the deletion, we need to find which nodes will be affected by the deletion. For each node formula_54 affected by the deletion, we copy the path from the root to formula_54. This will provide a new tree whose root is a copy of the root of the original tree. Then we perform the deletion on the new tree. We will end up with 2 versions of the tree. The original one which contains formula_41 and the new one which doesn&#x27;t contain formula_41. Since any deletion only modifies the path from the root to formula_54 and any appropriate deletion algorithm runs in formula_32, thus the deletion in the persistent data structure takes formula_32. Every sequence of insertion and deletion will cause the creation of a sequence of dictionaries or versions or trees formula_61 where each formula_62 is the result of operations formula_61. If each formula_62 contains formula_12 elements, then the search in each formula_62 takes formula_67. Using this persistent data structure we can solve the next element search problem in formula_32 query time and formula_69 space instead of formula_33. Please find below the source code for an example related to the next search problem.

==Examples of persistent data structures==
Perhaps the simplest persistent data structure is the singly linked list or &quot;cons&quot;-based list, a simple list of objects formed by each carrying a reference to the next in the list. This is persistent because the &quot;tail&quot; of the list can be taken, meaning the last &quot;k&quot; items for some &quot;k&quot;, and new nodes can be added in front of it. The tail will not be duplicated, instead becoming shared between both the old list and the new list. So long as the contents of the tail are immutable, this sharing will be invisible to the program.

Many common reference-based data structures, such as red–black trees, stacks, and treaps, can easily be adapted to create a persistent version. Some others need slightly more effort, for example: queues, dequeues, and extensions including min-deques (which have an additional &quot;O&quot;(1) operation &quot;min&quot; returning the minimal element) and random access deques (which have an additional operation of random access with sub-linear, most often logarithmic, complexity).

There also exist persistent data structures which use destructive operations, making them impossible to implement efficiently in purely functional languages (like Haskell outside specialized monads like state or IO), but possible in languages like C or Java. These types of data structures can often be avoided with a different design. One primary advantage to using purely persistent data structures is that they often behave better in multi-threaded environments.

===Linked lists===
Singly linked lists are the bread-and-butter data structure in functional languages. Some ML-derived languages, like Haskell, are purely functional because once a node in the list has been allocated, it cannot be modified, only copied, referenced or destroyed by the garbage collector when nothing refers to it. (Note that ML itself is not purely functional, but supports non-destructive list operations subset, that is also true in the Lisp (LISt Processing) functional language dialects like Scheme and Racket.)

Consider the two lists:
 xs = [0, 1, 2]
 ys = [3, 4, 5]
These would be represented in memory by:

where a circle indicates a node in the list (the arrow out representing the second element of the node which is a pointer to another node).

Now concatenating the two lists:
 zs = xs ++ ys
results in the following memory structure:

Notice that the nodes in list codice_1 have been copied, but the nodes in codice_2 are shared. As a result, the original lists (codice_1 and codice_2) persist and have not been modified.

The reason for the copy is that the last node in codice_1 (the node containing the original value codice_6) cannot be modified to point to the start of codice_2, because that would change the value of codice_1.

===Trees===
Consider a binary search tree, where every node in the tree has the recursive invariant that all subnodes contained in the left subtree have a value that is less than or equal to the value stored in the node, and subnodes contained in the right subtree have a value that is greater than the value stored in the node.

For instance, the set of data
 xs = [a, b, c, d, f, g, h]
might be represented by the following binary search tree:

A function which inserts data into the binary tree and maintains the invariant is:
 fun insert (x, E) = T (E, x, E)
 | insert (x, s as T (a, y, b)) =
 if x &lt; y then T (insert (x, a), y, b)
 else if x &gt; y then T (a, y, insert (x, b))
 else s
After executing
 ys = insert (&quot;e&quot;, xs)
The following configuration is produced:

Notice two points: first, the original tree (codice_1) persists. Second, many common nodes are shared between the old tree and the new tree. Such persistence and sharing is difficult to manage without some form of garbage collection (GC) to automatically free up nodes which have no live references, and this is why GC is a feature commonly found in functional programming languages.

=== Persistent hash array mapped trie ===
A persistent hash array mapped trie is a specialized variant of a hash array mapped trie that will preserve previous versions of itself on any updates. It is often used to implement a general purpose persistent map data structure.

Hash array mapped tries were originally described in a 2001 paper by Phil Bagwell entitled &quot;Ideal Hash Trees&quot;. This paper presented a mutable Hash table where &quot;Insert, search and delete times are small and constant, independent of key set size, operations are O(1). Small worst-case times for insert, search and removal operations can be guaranteed and misses cost less than successful searches&quot;. This data structure was then modified by Rich Hickey to be fully persistent for use in the Clojure programming language.

Conceptually, hash array mapped tries work similar to any generic tree in that they store nodes hierarchically and retrieve them by following a path down to a particular element. The key difference is that Hash Array Mapped Tries first use a hash function to transform their lookup key into a (usually 32 or 64 bit) integer. The path down the tree is then determined by using slices of the binary representation of that integer to index into a sparse array at each level of the tree. The leaf nodes of the tree behave similar to the buckets used to construct hash tables and may or may not contain multiple candidates depending on hash collisions.

Most implementations of persistent hash array mapped tries use a branching factor of 32 in their implementation. This means that in practice while insertions, deletions, and lookups into a persistent hash array mapped trie have a computational complexity of &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;), for most applications they are effectively constant time, as it would require an extremely large number of entries to make any operation take more than a dozen steps.

== Usage in programming languages ==

=== Haskell ===
Haskell is a pure functional language and therefore does not allow for mutation. Therefore, all data structures in the language are persistent, as it is impossible to not preserve the previous state of a data structure with functional semantics. This is because any change to a data structure that would render previous versions of a data structure invalid would violate referential transparency.

In its standard library Haskell has efficient persistent implementations for linked lists, Maps (implemented as size balanced trees), and Sets among others.

=== Clojure ===
Like many programming languages in the Lisp family, Clojure contains an implementation of a linked list, but unlike other dialects its implementation of a linked list has enforced persistence instead of being persistent by convention. Clojure also has efficient implementations of persistent vectors, maps, and sets based on persistent hash array mapped tries. These data structures implement the mandatory read-only parts of the Java collections framework.

The designers of the Clojure language advocate the use of persistent data structures over mutable data structures because they have value semantics which gives the benefit of making them freely shareable between threads with cheap aliases, easy to fabricate, and language independent.

These data structures form the basis of Clojure&#x27;s support for parallel computing since they allow for easy retries of operations to sidestep data races and atomic compare and swap semantics.

=== Elm ===
The Elm programming language is purely functional like Haskell, which makes all of its data structures persistent by necessity. It contains persistent implementations of linked lists as well as persistent arrays, dictionaries, and sets.

Elm uses a custom virtual DOM implementation that takes advantage of the persistent nature of Elm data. As of 2016 it was reported by the developers of Elm that this virtual DOM allows the Elm language to render HTML faster than the popular JavaScript frameworks React, Ember, and Angular.

=== Java ===
The Java programming language is not particularly functional. Despite this, the core JDK package java.util.concurrent includes CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet which are persistent structures, implemented using copy-on-write techniques. The usual concurrent map implementation in Java, ConcurrentHashMap, is not persistent, however. Fully persistent collections are available in third-party libraries, or other JVM languages.

=== JavaScript ===
The popular JavaScript frontend framework React is frequently used along with a state management system that implements the Flux architecture, a popular implementation of which is the JavaScript library Redux. The Redux library is inspired by the state management pattern used in the Elm programming language, meaning that it mandates that users treat all data as persistent. As a result, the Redux project recommends that in certain cases users make use of libraries for enforced and efficient persistent data structures. This reportedly allows for greater performance than when comparing or making copies of regular JavaScript objects.

One such library of persistent data structures Immutable.js is based on the data structures made available and popularized by Clojure and Scala. It is mentioned by the documentation of Redux as being one of the possible libraries that can provide enforced immutability. Mori.js brings data structures similar to those in Clojure to JavaScript. Immer.js brings an interesting approach where one &quot;creates the next immutable state by mutating the current one&quot;.
 Immer.js uses native JavaScript objects and not efficient persistent data structures and it might cause performance issues when data size is big.

=== Prolog ===
Prolog terms are naturally immutable and therefore data structures are typically persistent data structures. Their performance depends on sharing and garbage collection offered by the Prolog system. Extensions to non-ground Prolog terms are not always feasible because of search space explosion. Delayed goals might mitigate the problem.

Some Prolog systems nevertheless do provide destructive operations like setarg/3, which might come in different flavors, with/without copying and with/without backtracking of the state change. There are cases where setarg/3 is used to the good of providing a new declarative layer, like a constraint solver.

=== Scala ===
The Scala programming language promotes the use of persistent data structures for implementing programs using &quot;Object-Functional Style&quot;. Scala contains implementations of many persistent data structures including linked lists, red–black trees, as well as persistent hash array mapped tries as introduced in Clojure.

==Garbage collection==
Because persistent data structures are often implemented in such a way that successive versions of a data structure share underlying memory ergonomic use of such data structures generally requires some form of automatic garbage collection system such as reference counting or mark and sweep. In some platforms where persistent data structures are used it is an option to not use garbage collection which, while doing so can lead to memory leaks, can in some cases have a positive impact on the overall performance of an application.

<doc id="662897" wikidata="Q7739433" url="?curid=662897" title="The Herd (Australian band)">
<text>The Herd is an Australian hip hop group formed in Sydney. The group employs a &quot;full band&quot; format and is recognised for its live shows. The Herd is composed of Ozi Batla, Urthboy, Berzerkatron (MCs), Unkle Ho (beats), Traksewt (piano accordion, clarinet and beats), Sulo (beats and guitar), Toe-Fu (guitar), Rok Poshtya (bass) and singer Jane Tyrrell. The band&#x27;s songs often feature politically oriented lyrics. The group has been largely inactive since 2013, reuniting for select performances.

==History==
===2001–2004: &quot;The Herd&quot; &amp; &quot;An Elefant Never Forgets&quot;===
The Herd released their debut single &quot;Scallops&quot; in 2001. The song attracted radio airplay on Australian station Triple J. The song combines hip hop culture with Australian &quot;fast food&quot; descriptions including &quot;Like a $3.40 bag of fresh hip hop, From your local fish n&#x27; chip shop, Ah Scallops! With dollops of flavour on top, When we do what we do we give heads the bops&quot;

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;An Elefant Never Forgets&quot; was released in 2003. The first single &quot;Burn Down the Parliament&quot;, was released the same week as the Canberra bushfires of 2003, despite the unfortunate coincidence, the song&#x27;s lyrical content was completely unrelated to the natural disaster. The second single &quot;77%&quot;, became a prominent song featuring the line: &quot;77% of Aussies are racist&quot;—the lyric is a reference to 2001 Australian survey results regarding the response of the Australian Federal Government, led by then-prime minister John Howard, to the Tampa affair. &quot;77%&quot; was voted into position 46 of the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2003 and, as of October 2004, the album remained in the Australian alternative charts for over 80 weeks.

In a 2004 interview with Dr Tony Mitchell from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Ozi Batla explained:
I think the big challenge for Australian hip-hop is for it to expand on those 3000 people who will always buy the CD. The question people have to ask themselves is, who are the other 35000 odd people who bought the Hilltop Hoods album? It&#x27;s such a small insular and at times disturbingly ignorant little slice of Australia that I think we&#x27;d just be banging our heads against the wall trying to get through to those 15-year-old kids. Yeah, I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s always that responsibility of just trying to keep it true, even though we don&#x27;t focus on that as much as a lot of acts do, I think it&#x27;s always in the back of everyone&#x27;s mind – probably whatever art form it is – that if they really love the art form that they&#x27;re attempting or drawing influences from then, you know, everyone is always really quite sensitive about other people&#x27;s perceptions in that culture or community. I think that&#x27;s the only responsibility, and obviously not to sell out is the other one. But that is pretty unlikely. And I&#x27;d say to hopefully bring more people in and that&#x27;ll change the culture of it, or it&#x27;ll make that more ignorant style of the culture a bit more isolated. I don&#x27;t know, to tell you the truth, sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like we&#x27;re part of the community that&#x27;s there at all. And neither are a lot of the artists we know, and even the artists that are respected in that community just throw their hands up and go &#x27;Look, I stopped trying to deal on that level with those fans a long time&#x27;&quot;.

===2005–2007: &quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot;===
The Herd released their third album &quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot; in 2005, featuring the single &quot;We Can&#x27;t Hear You&quot;. Their subjects ranged from their well-known anti-war stance and anti-corporatism to more personal topics like divorce and the slow death of the Australian outback/country.

In October 2005, The Herd featured live on Triple J&#x27;s &#x27;Like a Version&#x27; (acoustic covers) segment. They performed their own version of the famous Australian 1983 song &quot;I Was Only Nineteen (A Walk in the Light Green)&quot; by Redgum. The song was so well received by fans that it received regular Triple J airplay and was voted #18 in the 2005 Triple J Hottest 100 countdown. They have since recorded a studio version which was included on the 2006 re-release of &quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot;, and they have also created a video clip for the song. The Herd performed at The Big Day Out 2007. Simon Fellows (Bezerkatron) left the group in late 2006.

In February 2008 the group performed a song about recycled water on the ABC&#x27;s Sleek Geeks programme.

===2008–2010: &quot;Summerland&quot;===
In May 2008, The Herd released its fourth studio album, &quot;Summerland&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;The King Is Dead&quot;, is a celebration of Australia&#x27;s change in government with John Howard being replaced after 11 years as prime minister by Kevin Rudd.

The album debuted at number 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and is the first album by The Herd to feature singer Jane Tyrell as full-time member of the group. Previously, Tyrell had provided vocals for a few songs on The Herd&#x27;s previous album, &quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot;.

===2011–present: &quot;Future Shade, Soul of my Soul&quot;===
In celebration of 10 years since the group debuted, the band performed its first live shows in two years in April 2011. The Herd released &quot;The Sum of it All&quot;, the first single from the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Future Shade&quot;, on 21 March 2011, The album was released in August 2011.

Better Live EP, a follow-up to &quot;Future Shade&quot;, was released the following year in March 2012.

The Herd performed at the &quot;WOMADelaide Festival&quot;, held at Botanic Park in Adelaide, Australia, in March 2013 and at the tenth anniversary of the Australian hip hop festival &quot;Come Together&quot; in June 2013.

In June 2024, after nearly 12 years of inactivity as a group, (outside the few reunions they did) The Herd released &quot;Soul of my Soul&quot;, a protest song against the Israel-Palestine war which features vocal contributions from Palestinian artists Sereen, Mo and Big Rigs. All proceeds from the song go towards Olive Kids, an Australian foundation dedicated to funding support for Palestinian youth.

==Activism==
In September 2009, The Herd was involved in a controversy regarding the act&#x27;s inclusion in the line-up for &quot;Coal to Coast&quot;, a regional youth festival held in Mackay, Queensland, with the local coal industry acting as the event&#x27;s primary funding source. Concerned fans brought the issue of the Herd&#x27;s involvement in the festival to the group&#x27;s attention and the story received national coverage in the mainstream media and debate occurred on &quot;Hack&quot;, a popular program on national radio station Triple J. As a response, Urthboy released a statement of apology and declared the urgency of global warming; he explained that the group&#x27;s booking agent, in addition to the Mackay Regional Council, failed to inform the band of the complete nature of the festival. The band proceeded to donate profits from the performance to Greenpeace, as part of the apology.

Twenty-nine hours before the band was due to perform, The Herd pulled out of the festival entirely, as the band members had discovered information—in multiple sources—that the festival was conceived of by Andrew Garratt, the Community Relations Officer at the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal. Ozi Batla appeared on &#x27;Hack&#x27; to discuss the band&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the festival, alongside the Queensland Young Liberals leader, who disagreed with the group&#x27;s decision, and the organiser of the festival.

In response to the proposed dumping of around 3 million cubic metres of dredged seabed onto the Great Barrier Reef, a legal team was formed by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) in late 2013/early 2014. The legal team received further support in April 2014, following the release of the &quot;Sounds for the Reef&quot; musical fundraising project. Produced by Straightup, the digital album features The Herd, in addition to artists such as John Butler, Sietta, Missy Higgins, The Cat Empire, Fat Freddys Drop, The Bamboos (featuring Kylie Auldist) and Resin Dogs. Released on 7 April, the album&#x27;s 21 songs were sold on the Bandcamp website.

==Side projects==
In April 2005, Unkle Ho released his debut solo album &quot;Roads to Roma&quot;. The album samples music from a wide variety of international musical genres, such as tango, mariachi, dixieland and blues rock.

<doc id="662902" wikidata="Q2159475" url="?curid=662902" title="Sock monkey">
<text>A sock monkey is a stuffed toy made from socks fashioned in the likeness of a monkey. These stuffed animals are a mixture of folk art and kitsch in the cultures of the United States and Canada. The typical sock monkey is brown and white with extra long limbs, a long tail and bright red lips. The animal may be adorned with additional ornamentation on its head or around its neck. The character has become part of popular culture and can be found in comic books and art.

== Origin ==
The sock monkey&#x27;s most direct predecessors originated in the Victorian era, when the craze for imitation stuffed animals swept from Europe into North America and met the burgeoning Arts and Crafts movement. Craft makers began sewing stuffed animals as toys to comfort children, and, as tales of the Scramble for Africa increased the public&#x27;s familiarity with exotic species, monkey toys soon became a fixture of American nurseries. Tales like Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and &quot;Just So Stories&quot; inspired crafters to create toys that depicted exotic animals, however these early stuffed monkeys were not necessarily made from socks, and also lacked the characteristic red lips of the sock monkeys popular today.

John Nelson, a Swedish immigrant to the United States, patented the sock-knitting machine in 1868, and began knitting socks on an automatic machine in Rockford, Illinois as early as 1870. On September 15, 1880, the Nelson Knitting Company formed, producing &quot;Celebrated Rockford Seamless Hosiery&quot;, and selling them under the name of the &quot;Nelson Sock&quot;.

John Nelson&#x27;s son Franklin created a machine that knitted a sock without seams in the heel. The original machine required workers to sew every seam at the heel. The seamless sock saved time and labor costs and it became so popular, companies began to imitate his idea. These seamless work socks were so popular that the market was soon flooded with imitators, and socks of this type were known under the generic term &quot;Rockfords&quot;.

The iconic sock monkeys made from red-heeled socks, known today as the &quot;Rockford Red Heel&quot;, emerged at the earliest in 1932, the year the Nelson Knitting Company added the trademark red heel to its product. In 1932, advertising executive Howard Monk came up with an idea to change the heel of the brown sock from white to red. The red heeled sock was marketed as &quot;de-tec-tip&quot;. Nelson Knitting added the red heel &quot;De-Tec-Tip&quot; to assure its customers that they were buying &quot;original Rockfords&quot; as opposed to the generic &quot;Rockfords&quot;. This red heel gave the monkeys their distinctive mouth and during the Great Depression, American crafters first made sock monkeys out of worn-out Rockford Red Heel Socks.

In 1953, a woman named Helen Cooke received the patent for sock monkeys. She sued a man named Stanley Levy because he sold sock monkeys but they were not the same design as hers. Levy contacted the Nelson Knitting Company hoping that they would declare the patent invalid. The company knew that people had been making dolls for the last two years, so they gathered up all the dolls that had been made the past two years so that they could have evidence proving that Helen Cooke should not have the patent. One of the most important pieces of evidence was a testimony and a doll made in February 1951 by a lady named Grace Wingent. She was a resident of Rockford and she had made a doll for her grandson. Helen Cooke settled the case against Stanley Levy when she was shown all the evidence that had been collected against her. She decided to sell the patent to the Nelson Knitting Company for $750. The company also paid other women for the rights to the doll including a woman in Tennessee who was paid $1000. Rockford, Illinois became the &quot;home of the sock monkey.&quot;

== Today ==
Sock monkeys remain a popular icon and are popular with all ages. They now come in different styles, such as &quot;birthday-themed&quot;, different colors, and even electronic ones that sing up-to-date pop songs. Most vintage red-heel sock monkeys found today are no older than the late 1950s, and many date from the 1970s.

A number of methods exist for dating red-heel sock monkeys, including the colors, shape of the red heel (elongated oval or swing), the amount of cream color in the red-heel and toe areas, sock seams, and interior sock content.

The term &quot;vintage&quot; red-heel sock monkeys is typically relegated to sock monkeys made from red-heel socks knitted by the Nelson Knitting Company and from similar socks knitted with red-heels by other companies in the same time period. The term &quot;modern&quot; red-heel sock monkeys is normally relegated to sock monkey dolls created after Fox River Mills, Inc. acquired the Nelson Knitting Company in 1992.

Homemade red-heel sock monkey dolls usually have unique faces and body characteristics and are considered one-of-a-kind. Sock monkey dolls are also mass-manufactured in the marketplace. Sock monkey dolls mass-manufactured by a company normally all have the same face and body characteristics. Not all sock monkey dolls are created from red-heel socks. A 2015 book shows that more colorful sock monkeys have become a trend, such as monkeys made from socks with multicolored striped or polka dot patterns, and monkeys made from mismatched socks.

People&#x27;s love for sock monkeys has made the toys the center of many special occasions: trips, birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and graduations, with their images now being used in photography, books, bookmarks, journals, greeting cards, jewelry, quilting, baking, sewing, commercials and movies.

Sock monkeys are found in literature: gift books like &quot;Monkey Love&quot;, and &quot;Friends Knock Your Socks Off&quot;; the children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secrets of Eastcliff-by-the-Sea&quot;; craft books such as &quot;Sew Cute and Collectible Sock Monkeys&quot;; and they can be seen in Tony Millionaire&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Sock Monkey&quot;, in which a sock monkey doll is the main character. There is a film adaptation of Millionaire&#x27;s comic currently in the works. They are also featured in the cover art for the 1992 alternative rock album &quot;Dirty&quot; by Sonic Youth. In 2024, a complete 392-page non-fiction sock monkey history book, &quot;Red Heel Sock Monkeys: Pop Culture Icons&quot; was published; illustrated with numerous photographs and cited references. 

One reason why sock monkeys are popular is that sock monkeys are said to be good luck charms, and as a result, people offer sock monkeys as gifts. Sock monkeys have been given to patients in hospitals as a symbol of a quick recovery. They have been given to employees to relieve stress and sock monkeys have been sent to soldiers overseas to relieve homesickness.

In February 2015, Jody Lewis of Bridgwater, Somerset UK, made the official Guinness world record for largest sock monkey made from individual socks. The sock monkey stands at 10 feet 5.59 inches.

== Festivals ==
The city of Rockford, Illinois, embraces the doll as part of its history. In 2005, Midway Village Museum in Rockford held its first &quot;Sock Monkey Madness Festival&quot;, where sock monkey fans could view an exhibit highlighting the industrial, legal, and creative history of the Nelson red-heel sock and the sock monkey. In 2009, the annual Sock Monkey Madness Festival was awarded a national Leadership in History Award of Merit from the American Association for State and Local History for excellence in educational programming.

The Sock Monkey Madness Festival also includes the original sock monkey that helped the Nelson Knitting Company win the patent and obtain the title “Home of the Sock Monkey.” Additionally, there is a 7-foot-2-inch sock monkey named &quot;Nelson&quot; (he acquired his namesake after the founder of the factory, John Nelson). Nelson, the super-sized sock monkey mascot created by author/crafter Dee Lindner was sewn out of 44 Rockford red-heeled socks. Furthermore, the festival is kid friendly and has unique attractions such as the “Sockford General Hospital”. The hospital is a “crafty clinic” that repairs sock monkeys if they require any care. Volunteers dress as nurses and fix any button eyes that fall off, torn mouths, or do any other sewing that is necessary.

<doc id="662904" wikidata="Q895505" url="?curid=662904" title="BoxRec">
<text>BoxRec or boxrec.com is a website dedicated to holding updated records of professional and amateur boxers, both male and female. It also maintains a MediaWiki-based encyclopaedia of boxing.

The objective of the site is to document every professional boxer and boxing match from the instigation of the Queensberry Rules up to the present times. BoxRec publishes ratings for all active boxers and all-time ratings. Since 2012 the site has hosted Barry Hugman&#x27;s History of World Championship Boxing.

==Foundation==
The site was founded by John Sheppard, an Englishman. Sheppard had never attended a boxing bout until 1995 when he attended a &quot;Prince&quot; Naseem Hamed fight with Hamed&#x27;s older brothers Riath and Nabeel. Sheppard had considered boxing to be a &quot;barbaric and degrading&quot; spectacle, stating &quot;I sat there watching people punch each other in the head, wondering why they were doing it... I was sprayed with blood, getting more and more miserable.&quot; However, Sheppard later explained, &quot;[D]uring Naseem&#x27;s fight, something clicked in my head. The subtlety of what he was doing, the genius of it all, became obvious to me. It wasn&#x27;t a disgusting spectacle anymore. It was art, and I found myself cheering.&quot;

Following Hamed&#x27;s split with Frank Warren, Sheppard went to work for Hamed at &quot;Prince Promotions&quot; in 2000. Sheppard then began to compile record of active British boxers in an attempt to aid matchmaking of boxers and then decided to create a website which would store the records of all boxers. The site has grown so much that Sheppard has gone full-time since 2005. on a typical day 50,000 visitors could view 700,000 pages with the record of 1,300,000 bouts in its database encompassing 17,000 active and 345,000 non-active fighters.

==Organization==
The website is updated by volunteer editors from many countries around the world. Each editor is assigned a country or in some instances, regions within countries and they maintain the records for boxers in that country or region. BoxRec also rates each active fighter by weight division.

==Criticism of the website==
BoxRec has been criticized for not keeping correct records for boxers, especially historic fighters. In 2005, BoxRec applied to become recognized as the official record keepers for the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC). The ABC held interviews with both Fight Fax and BoxRec at their 2005 convention. Each applicant made a submission and presentation to the ABC panel which included state commissioners and attorneys. The panel then voted unanimously in favour to award Fight Fax the position. The ABC later revealed that they had performed tests to measure the accuracy of each company&#x27;s records: Fight Fax&#x27;s records were shown to be 100% accurate, while the accuracy of BoxRec&#x27;s records was found to be &quot;substantially lower&quot;. Nonetheless, in 2016 the ABC voted to recognize Boxrec as an official record-keeper alongside Fight Fax.

Boxing promoter J. Russell Peltz stated &quot;very few things in life are one hundred percent. But I&#x27;ve come across some glaring errors at BoxRec, mostly in the historical records.&quot; ESPN&#x27;s Dan Rafael noted that &quot;so many people have a hand in BoxRec that the records aren&#x27;t always accurate. Ricardo Mayorga&#x27;s record has been wrong for years. There&#x27;s a mistake [in] Derrick Gainer&#x27;s record too.&quot;

==Plaudits from boxing personalities==
When asked how important BoxRec was to him, boxing promoter Lou DiBella stated that &quot;anyone in boxing who says he doesn&#x27;t use BoxRec is either a complete imbecile or lying&quot; and Bruce Trampler, the matchmaker for Top Rank, said that &quot;short of actually being at a fight, they&#x27;re the best source of information out there.&quot;

Boxing journalist Thomas Hauser also asked the chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission Ron Scott Stevens what his thoughts were, and Stevens was quoted as saying &quot;Fight Fax is the mandated record-keeper for athletic commissions in the United States. But BoxRec does more than supplement Fight Fax. In many respects, it surpasses Fight Fax.&quot;

David Haye, when commenting on what was then his only professional loss at the time, stated 
I&#x27;d love to get revenge over Carl Thompson, I know I have improved and made the adjustments required, but still, I take a look at my record at BoxRec and I see this red blob there, that one loss there really does stick out at me.
== WBA ==
Boxrec announced that, as of August, 2024, the webpage no longer recognizes World Boxing Association world championship fights as being for world titles and WBA world champions as having been world champions, at least as far as their WBA championships are concerned.

<text>The United States Army Air Service (USAAS) (also known as the &quot;Air Service&quot;, &quot;U.S. Air Service&quot; and before its legislative establishment in 1920, the &quot;Air Service, United States Army&quot;) was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army between 1918 and 1926 and a forerunner of the United States Air Force. It was established as an independent but temporary branch of the U.S. War Department during World War I by two executive orders of President Woodrow Wilson: on May 24, 1918, replacing the Aviation Section, Signal Corps as the nation&#x27;s air force; and March 19, 1919, establishing a military Director of Air Service to control all aviation activities. Its life was extended for another year in July 1919, during which time Congress passed the legislation necessary to make it a permanent establishment. The National Defense Act of 1920 assigned the Air Service the status of &quot;combatant arm of the line&quot; of the United States Army with a major general in command.

In France, the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force, a separate entity under commanding General John J. Pershing that conducted the combat operations of U.S. military aviation, began field service in the spring of 1918. By the end of the war, the Air Service used 45 squadrons to cover 137 kilometers (85 miles) of front from Pont-à-Mousson to Sedan. 71 pursuit pilots were credited with shooting down five or more German aircraft while in American service. Overall the Air Service destroyed 756 enemy aircraft and 76 balloons in combat. 17 balloon companies also operated at the front, making 1,642 combat ascensions. 289 airplanes and 48 balloons were lost in battle.

The Air Service was the first form of the air force to have an independent organizational structure and identity. Although officers concurrently held rank in various branches, after May 1918 their branch designation in official correspondence while on aviation assignment changed from &quot;ASSC&quot; (Aviation Section, Signal Corps) to &quot;AS, USA&quot; (Air Service, United States Army). After July 1, 1920, its personnel became members of the Air Service branch, receiving new commissions. During the war its responsibilities and functions were split between two coordinate agencies, the Division of Military Aeronautics (DMA) and the Bureau of Aircraft Production (BAP), each reporting directly to the Secretary of War, creating a dual authority over military aviation that caused unity of command difficulties.

The seven-year history of the post-war Air Service was marked by a prolonged debate between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services about the value of an independent Air Force. Airmen such as Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell supported the independent air concept. The Army&#x27;s senior leadership from World War I, the United States Navy, and the majority of the nation&#x27;s political leadership favored integration of all military aviation into the Army and Navy. Aided by a wave of pacifism following the war that drastically cut military budgets, opponents of an independent air force prevailed. The Air Service was renamed the Army Air Corps in 1926 as a compromise in the continuing struggle.

==Creation of the Air Service==
===Background of the wartime Air Service===
Although war in Europe prompted Congress to vastly increase the appropriations for the Aviation Section in 1916, it nevertheless tabled a bill proposing an aviation department incorporating all aspects of military aviation. The declaration of war against Germany on April 6, 1917, putting the United States in World War I, came too quickly (less than eight months after its use in Mexico chasing Pancho Villa) to solve emerging engineering and production problems. The reorganization of the Aviation Section had been inadequate in resolving problems in training, leaving the United States totally unprepared to fight an air war in Europe. The Aviation Section consisted of 131 officers, 1087 enlisted men, and approximately 280 airplanes.

The administration of President Woodrow Wilson created an advisory &quot;Aircraft Production Board&quot; in May 1917, consisting of members of the Army, Navy and industry, to study the Europeans&#x27; experience in aircraft production and the standardization of aircraft parts. The Board dispatched Major Raynal C. Bolling, a lawyer and military aviation pioneer, together with a commission of over 100 members, to Europe in the summer of 1917 to determine American aircraft needs, recommend priorities for acquisition and production, and negotiate prices and royalties. Congress passed a series of legislation in the next three months that appropriated huge sums for development of military aviation, including the largest single appropriation for a single purpose to that time, $640 million in the Aviation Act (40 &quot;Stat&quot;. 243), passed July 24, 1917. By the time the bill passed, the term &quot;Air Service&quot; was in widespread if unofficial usage to collectively describe all aspects of Army aviation.

Although it considered creation of a separate aviation department to act as the centralized authority for decision-making, both the War and the Navy Departments opposed it, and on October 1, 1917, Congress instead legalized the existence of the APB and changed its name to the &quot;Aircraft Board&quot;, transferring its functions from the Council of National Defense to the secretaries of War and the Navy. Even so, the Aircraft Board in practice had little control over procurement contracts and functioned mostly as an information provider between industrial, governmental, and military entities. Nor did the &quot;Equipment Division&quot; of the Signal Corps exercise such control. Established by the Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO) as one of the operating components of the Aviation Section, its task was to unify and coordinate the various agencies involved but its head was a commissioned former member of the APB who did nothing to create any effective coordination. Moreover, the largely wood and fabric airframe designs of World War I did not lend themselves to being made with the mass production methods of the automotive industry, which used considerable amounts of metallic materials instead, and the priority of mass-producing spare parts was neglected. Though individual areas within the aviation industry responded well, the industry as a whole failed. Efforts to mass-produce European aircraft under license largely failed because the aircraft, made by hand, were not amenable to the more precise American manufacturing methods. At the same time the Aeronautical Division of the OCSO was renamed the &quot;Air Division&quot; with continued responsibility for training and operations but with no influence on acquisition or doctrine. In the end the decision-making process in aircraft procurement was badly fragmented and production on a large scale proved impossible.

===Aircraft production failures===
The Aircraft Board came under severe criticism for failure to meet goals or its own claims of aircraft production, followed by a highly publicized personal investigation by Gutzon Borglum, a harshly vocal critic of the board. Borglum had exchanged letters with President Wilson, a personal friend, from which he assumed an appointment to investigate had been authorized, which the administration soon denied. Both the U.S. Senate and the Department of Justice began investigations into possible fraudulent dealings. President Wilson also acted by appointing a Director of Aircraft Production on April 28, 1918, and abolished the Air Division of the OCSO, creating a Division of Military Aeronautics (DMA) with Brigadier General William L. Kenly brought back from France to be its head, to separate supervision of aviation from the duties of the Chief Signal Officer. Less than a month later, Wilson used a war powers provision of the Overman Act of May 20, 1918, to issue Executive Order No. 2862 that suspended for the duration of the war plus six months the statutory responsibilities of the Aviation Section and removed the DMA entirely from the Signal Corps (reporting directly to the Secretary of War). The DMA was assigned the function of procuring and training a combat force. In addition, the executive order created a Bureau of Aircraft Production (BAP), a military organization with a civilian director, as a separate executive bureau to provide the aircraft needed.

This arrangement lasted only until the War Department implemented the executive order on May 24 by issuing General Order No. 51 to coordinate the two independent agencies, with an eventual goal of creating a &quot;Director of Air Service&quot;. (The term &quot;Air Service&quot; had been in use in France since June 13, 1917, to describe the function of aviation units attached to the American Expeditionary Force.) It delayed the appointment of a director as long as the BAP operated as a separate executive bureau. In August, the Senate completed its investigation of the Aircraft Board, and while it found no criminal culpability, it reported that massive waste and delay in production had occurred. As a result, the Director of Aircraft Production (who was also chairman of the Aircraft Board), John D. Ryan, was appointed to the vacant position of Second Assistant Secretary of War and designated as Director of Air Service, nominally in charge of the DMA. The Department of Justice report followed two months later and also blamed the delays on administrative and organizational deficiencies in the Aviation Section. Ryan&#x27;s appointment came too late for any effective consolidation of both agencies, continuing an obstructive division of authority that was never resolved during the war.

Following the Armistice, Ryan resigned on November 27, leaving both the BAP and DMA, as well as the original Aircraft Board, leaderless. In addition certain powers, primarily those of dealing legally with the government-owned Spruce Production Corporation, had been delegated to Ryan by name, not to his position as Director of Aircraft Production, and as such could not be legally conferred on any successor. Maj. Gen. Charles Menoher was appointed to the vacancy on January 2, 1919, but the patchwork nature of laws and executive orders that had created the various parts of the Air Service prevented him from exercising all their legal powers and ending the unity of command problems caused by dual authority.

===Pilot training===

The United States began the World War with 65 pilots, a few of which were veterans of the Mexican Expedition, and some who were still in training. None were familiar with the control systems being used in Europe. Like the rest of the Army, the Aviation Section concluded that training Reserve officers was the solution to its manpower needs and sent a panel of three representatives from each of six U.S. universities to Toronto from 7 to 11 May 1917 to study Canada&#x27;s pilot training program. The Chief Signal Officer assigned Major Hiram Bingham III, an adventurer and reserve officer on the faculty of Yale, to organize a training program on the Canadian model. A three-phase Flying Cadet program came into being, and although systematic, pressing needs for manpower saw many overlaps of the phases.

The first phase was an eight-week ground school course conducted by the Schools of Military Aeronautics Division, organized at the six (later eight) American universities, and commanded by Bingham. The first class at the ground schools began 21 May 1917 and concluded 14 July 1917, graduating 147 cadets and enrolling another 1,430. By mid-November, 3,140 had graduated and more than 500 had become rated officers.

Out of more than 40,000 applicants, 22,689 were accepted and 17,540 completed ground school training. Approximately 15,000 advanced to primary (preliminary) flying training, a six-to-eight week course conducted by both military and civilian flying instructors, using variants of the Curtiss Jenny as the primary trainer. Primary flying training school usually produced a candidate for commissioning in 15 to 25 hours of flight. At the assurance of the French that they could be rapidly trained in all phases, 1,700 cadets who had graduated from ground school were sent to Europe to undertake the entire flying portion of their training in Great Britain, France, and Italy. In December 1917, after receiving 1,400 of the cadets, the French requested that further movement of cadets be halted because of training backlogs of as much as six months, and no further student pilots were sent to France until they had completed their primary training and been commissioned. During the backlog, more than 1,000 cadets were used as cooks, guards, laborers and other menial jobs, while paid at cadet salary (in the grade and rank of private first class), for which they became derisively known as the &quot;Million-Dollar Guard&quot;. The backlog was finally cleared by opening an Air Service primary school at Tours and devoting part of the advanced school at Issoudun to preliminary training for a period of time.

The U.S. training program produced more than 10,000 pilots as new first lieutenants in the Signal Officers Reserve Corps (S.O.R.C.). 8,688 received ratings of Reserve Military Aviator in the United States and were assigned to newly created squadrons or as instructors. 1,609 more were commissioned in Europe, with their commissions backdated in February and March 1918 to those of their peers trained in the United States. Pilots in Europe completed an advanced phase in which they received specialized training in pursuit, bombing, or observation at Air Service schools acquired from the French at Issoudun, Clermont-Ferrand, and Tours, respectively.

By November 11, 1918, the Air Service both overseas and domestically had 195,024 personnel (20,568 officers; 174,456 enlisted men) and 7,900 aircraft, constituting five per cent of the United States Army. 32,520 personnel served in the Bureau of Aircraft Production and the remainder in the Division of Military Aeronautics. The Air Service commissioned over 17,000 reserve officers. More than 10,000 mechanics were trained to service the American aircraft fleet. Of aircraft manufactured in America, the de Havilland DH-4B (3,400) was the most numerous, although only 1,213 were shipped overseas, and only 1,087 of those assembled, most used in observation units. The facilities of the Air Service in the United States totaled 40 flying fields, 8 balloon fields, 5 schools of military aeronautics, 6 technical schools, and 14 aircraft depots. 16 additional training schools were located in France, and officers also trained at three schools operated by the Allies.

A byproduct of the training program was the creation of the American airmail system. On May 3, 1918, Col. Henry H. Arnold, Assistant Director of the DMA, was ordered to put together a daily route for moving mail by airplane between New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. He assigned the task to the Executive Officer for Flying Training, Major Reuben H. Fleet. The Air Service, using six pilots (four instructor pilots and two new graduates) and six Curtiss JN-4H &quot;Jenny&quot; trainers modified to carry mail, began the mail service on May 15. It later extended the route to Boston and added Curtiss R-4LMs to its small fleet, carrying mail until August 12, 1918, when the U.S. Post Office took over.

==Air Service of the AEF==
===Organization===

Sent to Europe in March 1917 as an observer, Lieutenant Colonel Billy Mitchell arrived in Paris just four days after the United States declared war and established an office for the American &quot;air service.&quot; Upon his arrival in France in June 1917, American Expeditionary Force commanding general John J. Pershing met with Mitchell, who advised Pershing that his office was ready to proceed with any project Pershing might require. Pershing&#x27;s aviation officer, Major Townsend F. Dodd, first used the term &quot;Air Service&quot; in a memo to the chief of staff of the AEF on 20 June 1917. The term also appeared on July 5, 1917, in AEF General Order (G.O.) No. 8, in tables detailing staff organization and duties. Mitchell replaced Dodd on 30 June 1917, with the position renamed &quot;Chief of Air Service&quot; and its duties described. After Mitchell was superseded in September by Kenly, he remained as &quot;ex officio&quot; chief through his influence on Kenly as Air Commander, Zone of the Advance (ACA).

The &quot;Air Service, American Expeditionary Forces&quot; was formally created on 3 September 1917 by the publication of AEF G.O. No. 31 and remained in being until demobilized in 1919. Kenly, an artillery officer, had been a student the previous winter in the Field Officers Course at the Aviation School in San Diego, then served as executive officer of the school to gain administrative experience in aviation matters. Mitchell, Bolling and Dodd were promoted to colonel and given senior positions in the Air Service hierarchy. Bolling was made Director of Air Service Supply (DASS) to administer the &quot;Zone of the Line of Communications&quot; (sic), later called the Service of Supply, and Dodd was named Director of Air Service Instruction (DAI). Kenley proved to be only an interim commander, as Brig. Gen. Benjamin Foulois replaced him on 27 November 1917, arriving in France with a large but untrained staff of non-aviators. This resulted in considerable resentment from Mitchell&#x27;s smaller staff already in place, many of whom in key positions, including Bolling, Dodd and Lt. Col. Edgar S. Gorrell, were immediately displaced. Mitchell, however, was not replaced and became a source of persistent discord with Foulois.

Pershing restated the responsibilities of the Air Service AEF with G.O. No. 81, May 29, 1918, in which he replaced Foulois as Chief of Air Service AEF with a West Point classmate and non-aviator, Major General Mason Patrick. Air Service staff planning had been inefficient, with considerable internal dissension as well as conflict between its members and those of Pershing&#x27;s General Staff. Aircraft and unit totals lagged far behind those promised in 1917. Officers in the combat units balked at taking orders from Foulois&#x27; non-flying staff. Considerable house-cleaning of the existing staff resulted from Patrick&#x27;s appointment, bringing in experienced staff officers to administrate, and tightening up lines of communication.

Pershing had in September 1917 called for creation of 260 U.S. air combat squadrons by December 1918, but slowness of the buildup reduced that on August 17, 1918, to a final plan for 202 by June 1919. In Pershing&#x27;s view, the two functions of the AEF&#x27;s Air Service were to repel German aircraft and conduct observation of enemy movements. The heart of the proposed force would be its 101 observation squadrons (52 corps observation and 49 army observation), to be distributed to three armies and 16 corps. In addition, 60 pursuit squadrons, 27 night-bombardment squadrons, and 14 day-bombardment squadrons were to conduct supporting operations.

Without the time or infrastructure in the United States to equip units to send overseas using aircraft designed and built in the U.S., the AEF Air Service acquired Allied aircraft designs already in service with the French and British air services. On August 30, 1917, the American and French governments agreed to a contract for the purchase of 1,500 Breguet 14 B.2 bombers-reconnaissance planes; 2,000 SPAD XIII and 1,500 Nieuport 28 pursuits for delivery by July 1, 1918. By the armistice, the AEF actually received 4,874 aircraft from the French, in addition to 258 from Great Britain, 19 from Italy, and 1,213 of American manufacture, for a total of 6,364 airplanes. 1,664 were classed as training craft.

The United States recognized that French skilled labor was severely limited by war casualties, and promised to train and deploy 7,000 automobile mechanics to aid the French Motor Transport Corps. In December 1917 the Aviation Section developed a maintenance organization of four large units termed &quot;Motor Mechanics Regiments, Signal Corps&quot;, each regiment consisting of four battalions of five companies totaling more than 3,600 men. The key innovative element was the use of junior officers recruited from the automobile industry as &quot;technical officers&quot; to supervise maintenance. In February 1918, Colonel S.D. Waldon of the Signal Corps returned from observing British factory and field methods in aviation operations, just as the Bureau of Aircraft Production concluded that the French were unable to meet their aircraft production goals. Waldon recommended that the regiments be reorganized for aircraft instead of automobile mechanics. The change came too late to affect the 1st and 2nd Regiments, which landed in France in March 1918, but both the 3rd and 4th Regiments reorganized, delaying their deployment until the end of July. By the Armistice all four regiments were configured as aircraft repair and maintenance units, and designated &quot;Air Service Mechanics Regiments&quot;.

The primary aircraft used by the AEF at the front (the &quot;Zone of Advance&quot;) were the SPAD XIII (877), Nieuport 28 (181), and SPAD VII (103) as pursuit aircraft, the DeHaviland DH-4B (696) and Breguet 14 (87) for daylight bombing, and the DH-4 and Salmson 2 A.2 (557) for observation and photo reconnaissance. The SE-5 operated as the main trainer for the Air Service. Balloon companies operated the French-designed Goodyear Type R, a winch-tethered, hydrogen-filled, captive &quot;Caquot&quot; observation balloon of 32,200 cubic-foot (912 cubic meters) capacity, deploying one balloon per company.
The United States adopted a national insignia for all military aircraft in May 1917 using the colors specified for the U.S. flag, consisting of a white five-pointed star inside of a blue circumscribed circle, with a red circle in the center of the star having a diameter tangent to the pentagon of the interior points of the star. The insignia was ordered painted on both wingtips of the upper surface of the top wing, the lower surface of bottom wings, and the fuselage of all Army aircraft on 17 May 1917. However due to concerns about confusion with the markings of enemy aircraft, in early 1918 a red, blue, and white roundel similar to those used by the Allied Powers, in the former color arrangement of the defunct Imperial Russian Air Service, was instead ordered painted on all U.S. aircraft operating in Europe, remaining in effect until 1919.

On May 6, 1918 Foulois established a policy authorizing creation of emblems for aviation units, and ordered all squadrons to create an official insignia to be painted on each side of an airplane fuselage: &quot;The squadron will design their own insignia during the period of organizational training. The design must be submitted to the Chief of Air Service, AEF, for approval. The design should be simple enough to be recognizable from a distance.&quot;

===Operations===
====&quot;Firsts&quot;====
The first U.S. aviation squadron to reach France was the 1st Aero Squadron, which sailed from New York in August 1917 and arrived at Le Havre on September 3. A member of the squadron, Lt. Stephen W. Thompson, achieved the first aerial victory by the U.S. military while flying as a gunner-observer with a French day bombing squadron on February 5, 1918. As other squadrons were organized, they were sent overseas, where they continued their training. The first U.S. squadron to see combat, on February 19, 1918, was the 103rd Aero Squadron, a pursuit unit flying with French forces and composed largely of former members of the Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps. The first U.S. aviator killed in action during aerial combat occurred March 8, 1918, when Captain James E. Miller, commanding the 95th Pursuit Squadron, was shot down while on a voluntary patrol near Reims. The first aerial victory in an American unit was by 1st Lt. Paul F. Baer of the 103rd Aero Squadron, and formerly a member of the Lafayette Flying Corps, on March 11. The first victories credited to American-trained pilots came on April 14, 1918, when Lieutenants Alan F. Winslow and Douglas Campbell of the 94th Pursuit Squadron scored. The first mission by an American squadron across the lines occurred April 11, when the 1st Aero Squadron, led by its commander, Major Ralph Royce, flew a photo reconnaissance mission to the vicinity of Apremont.

The first American balloon group arrived in France on December 28, 1917. It separated into four companies that were assigned individually to training centers and instructed in French balloon procedures, then equipped with Caquot balloons, winches, and parachutes. The 2d Balloon Company joined the French 91st Balloon Company at the front near Royaumeix on February 26, 1918. On March 5 it took over the line and began operations supporting the U.S. 1st Division, becoming the &quot;first complete American Air Service unit in history to operate against an enemy on foreign soil.&quot;

====Units and tactics====
By the beginning of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive the Air Service AEF consisted of 32 squadrons (15 pursuit, 13 observation, and 4 bombing) at the front, while by November 11, 1918, 45 squadrons (20 pursuit, 18 observation, and 7 bombardment) had been assembled for combat. During the war, these squadrons played important roles in the Battle of Château-Thierry, the St-Mihiel Offensive, and the Meuse-Argonne. Several units, including the 94th Pursuit Squadron under the command of Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, and the 27th Pursuit Squadron, which had &quot;balloon buster&quot; 1st Lt. Frank Luke as one of its pilots, achieved distinguished records in combat and remained a permanent part of the air forces.

Observation planes often operated individually, as did pursuit pilots to attack a balloon or to meet the enemy in a dogfight. However the tendency was toward formation flying, for pursuit as well as for bombardment operations, as a defensive tactic. The dispersal of squadrons among the army ground units (each corps and division had an observation squadron attached) made coordination of air activities difficult, so that squadrons were organized by functions into groups, the first of these being the I Corps Observation Group, organized in April 1918 to patrol the Toul Sector between Flirey and Apremont in support of the U.S. 26th Division. On May 5, 1918, the 1st Pursuit Group was formed, and by the armistice the AEF had 14 heavier-than-air groups (7 observation, 5 pursuit, and 2 bombardment). Of these 14 groups, only the 1st Pursuit and 1st Day Bombardment Groups had their lineage continued into the post-war Air Service. In July 1918 the AEF organized its first wing formation, the 1st Pursuit Wing, made up of the 2d Pursuit, 3rd Pursuit, and 1st Day Bombardment Groups.
Each army and corps echelon of the ground forces had a chief of air service designated to direct operations. The Air Service, First Army was activated August 26, 1918, marking the commencement of large scale coordinated U.S. air operations. Foulois was named chief of the First Army Air Service over Mitchell, who had been directing air operations as chief of the I Corps Air Service since March, but Foulois voluntarily relinquished his post to Mitchell and became the Assistant Chief of Air Service, Tours, to unsnarl delays in personnel, supply, and training. Mitchell went on to become a brigadier general and chief of the Army Group Air Service in mid-October 1918, succeeded at First Army by Col. Thomas Milling. The Air Service, Second Army was activated on October 12 with Col. Frank P. Lahm as chief but was not ready for operations until just before the armistice. The Air Service, Third Army was created immediately after the armistice to provide aviation support to the army of occupation, primarily from veteran units transferred from the First Army Air Service.

Despite their fractious relationship, Mitchell and Foulois were of one mind on the necessity of forming an &quot;air force&quot; to centralize control over tactical aviation. In the St-Mihiel Offensive, commencing September 12, 1918, the American and French offensive against the German salient was supported by 1,481 airplanes directed by Mitchell, totaling 24 Air Service, 58 French &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot;, and three Royal Air Force squadrons in coordinated operations. Observation and pursuit planes supported ground forces, while the other two-thirds of the aerial force bombed and strafed behind enemy lines. Later, during the Meuse-Argonne offensive, Mitchell employed a smaller concentration of airpower, nearly all American this time, to keep the German army on the defensive.

===Army of occupation duties===

Promptly after the armistice, the AEF formed the Third United States Army to march immediately into Germany, occupy the Coblenz area, and be prepared to resume combat if peace treaty negotiations failed. Three corps were formed from eight of the Army&#x27;s most experienced divisions, and Mitchell was appointed Chief of Air Service, Third Army, on November 14, 1918.

As with the ground forces, the most veteran units of the Air Service were selected to form the new Air Service. A pursuit unit, the 94th &quot;Hat in the Ring&quot; Aero Squadron; a day bombardment squadron, the 166th; and four observation squadrons (1st, 12th, 88th, and 9th Night) were initially assigned. The demobilization of the AEF accelerated in December and January, and all but two of these squadrons returned to the United States. Mitchell was replaced in January as commander of the Third Army Air Service by Col. Harold Fowler, a combat veteran of the Royal Flying Corps and former commander of the American 17th Pursuit Squadron.

On April 15, 1919, the Second Army Air Service in France also closed down. Its former air units were transferred to the Third Army Air Service in Germany. The Third Army and its air service were inactivated in July 1919 after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

===Statistical summary, World War I===

&quot;Though the casualties in the air force were small compared with the total strength, the casualty rate of the flying personnel at the front was somewhat above the Artillery and Infantry rates... The results of allied and American experience at the front indicate that two aviators lose their lives in accidents for each aviator killed in battle.&quot; —&quot;Report of the Secretary of War, 1919&quot;

The Air Service, American Expeditionary Force, totaled 78,507 personnel (7,738 officers and 70,769 enlisted men) at the armistice. Of this total, 58,090 served in France; 20,075 in England; and 342 in Italy. Balloon troops made up approximately 17,000 of the Air Service, with 6,811 in France, conducting and supporting the dangerous duty of spotting for the artillery at the front. In all, 211 squadrons of all types trained in Great Britain, with 71 arriving in France before the Armistice. At its peak establishment in November 1918, the Air Service was based at 31 stations in the Services of Supply (rear areas) and 78 aerodromes in the Zone of Advance (combat area).

The 740 combat airplanes equipping the units at the front on November 11, 1918, were approximately 11% of the total combat aircraft strength of the Allied forces. The 45 squadrons in the Zone of Advance had 767 pilots, 481 observers, and 23 aerial gunners, covering 137 kilometers of front from Pont-à-Mousson to Sedan. They flew more than 35,000 hours over the front lines. The Air Service conducted 150 bombing missions, the longest 160 miles behind German lines, and dropped 138 tons (125 kg) of bombs. Its squadrons had confirmed destruction of 756 German aircraft and 76 German balloons, creating 71 Air Service aces. Rickenbacker finished the war as the leading American ace, with 26 aircraft destroyed. 35 balloon companies also deployed in France, 17 at the front and six en route to the Second Army, and made 1,642 combat ascensions totaling 3,111 hours of observation. 13 photographic sections were assigned to observation squadrons and made 18,000 aerial photographs.

43 flying training, air park (supply), depot (maintenance), and construction squadrons were located in the Services of Supply. A major air depot at Colombey-les-Belles; three other maintenance depots at Behonne, LaTrecey, and Vinets; four supply depots at Clichy, Romorantin, Tours, and Is-sur-Tille; and 12 air park squadrons maintained the combat and training forces. Aircraft acquired from European sources were accepted at Aircraft Acceptance Park No. 1 at Orly, while those shipped from the United States for assembly in France were delivered to Air Service Production Center No. 2, built on the site of a former pine forest at Romorantin. Ferry operations of over 6,300 new aircraft to the air depots in &quot;often...far from perfect&quot; weather conditions resulted in the successful delivery of 95% and the loss of only eight pilots.
A large training establishment was also set up. In France the Air Service Concentration Barracks at Saint-Maixent received all newly arrived Air Service troops, distributing them to 26 training fields and schools throughout the central and western regions of the country. Flying training schools, equipped with 2,948 airplanes, supplied 1,674 fully trained pilots and 851 observers to the Air Service, with 1,402 pilots and 769 observers serving at the front. The observers trained in France included 825 artillery officers from the infantry divisions who volunteered to fill a critical shortage in 1918. After the Armistice, the schools graduated 675 additional pilots and 357 observers to serve with the Third Army Air Service in the Army of Occupation. The 3rd Aviation Instruction Center at Issoudun provided 766 pursuit pilots. 169 students and 49 instructors died in training accidents. Balloon candidates made 4,224 practice ascensions while training.

Air Service combat losses were 289 airplanes and 48 balloons with 235 airmen killed in action, 130 wounded, 145 captured, and 654 Air Service members of all ranks dead of illness or accidents. Air Service personnel were awarded 611 decorations in combat, including 4 Medals of Honor and 312 Distinguished Service Crosses (54 were oak leaf clusters). 210 decorations were awarded to aviators by France, 22 by Great Britain, and 69 by other nations.

==Post-war==

===Consolidation of the Air Service===
Executive Order 3066, issued by President Wilson on March 19, 1919, formally consolidated the BAP and DMA into the &quot;Air Service, United States Army&quot;. Anticipating the order, Director of Air Service Maj. Gen. Charles Menoher undertook a sweeping re-organization on March 15, using the &quot;divisional system&quot; of the AEF as a model. Menoher created an advisory board representing the key branches of the Army, and appointed an Executive to coordinate policy between four groups, each headed by an Assistant Executive: Supply, Information, Training and Operations, and Administrative. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, President Wilson relinquished his war powers under the Overman Act, and on July 11 Congress granted legislative authority to continue the Air Service as a temporary independent branch of the War Department for another year, easing fears of airmen that the Air Service would be demobilized out of existence. 
At the end of November 1918, the Air Service consisted of 185 flying, 44 construction, 114 supply, 11 replacement, and 150 spruce production squadrons; 86 balloon companies; six balloon group headquarters; 15 construction companies; 55 photographic sections; and a few miscellaneous units. Its personnel strength was 19,189 officers and 178,149 enlisted men. Its aircraft inventory consisted primarily of Curtiss JN-4 trainers, de Havilland DH-4B scout planes, SE-5 and Spad S.XIII fighters, and Martin MB-1 bombers.

Complete demobilization of the Air Service was accomplished within a year. By November 22, 1919, the Air Service had been reduced to one construction, one replacement, and 22 flying squadrons; 32 balloon companies; 15 photographic sections; and 1,168 officers and 8,428 enlisted men. The combat strength of the Air Service was only four pursuit and four bombardment squadrons. Although the leaders of the reorganized Air Service persuaded the General Staff to increase the combat strength to 20 squadrons by 1923, the balloon force was demobilized, including dirigibles, and personnel shrank even further, to just 880 officers. By July 1924, the Air Service inventory was 457 observation planes, 55 bombers, 78 pursuit planes, and 8 attack aircraft, with trainers to make the total number 754.

The Air Service replaced its wartime structure with the formation of six permanent groups in 1919, four of which were based in the United States and two overseas. The first of the new groups, the Army Surveillance Group, was organized in July to direct the operations of three squadrons patrolling the border with Mexico, where revolution had broken out, from Brownsville, Texas to Nogales, Arizona. In addition, the 1st Day Bombardment Group was formed to control four bombardment squadrons at Kelly, while the 1st Pursuit Group of four pursuit squadrons relocated from Selfridge Field, Michigan, to add their weight to the effort. Collectively the three groups (the entire combat strength of the Air Service in the continental United States) comprised the &quot;1st Wing&quot;. In January 1920 only the surveillance group continued the patrols, which gradually diminished until June 1921 when they ceased entirely.

Another group was organized overseas in 1920 to administrate squadrons in the Philippines. In 1921, the three groups based within the United States were sequentially numbered one through three and assigned different combat roles. The fourth was inactivated. The next year the groups overseas were numbered four through six as &quot;composite&quot; groups. In 1922 plans were formulated for three more groups to flesh out the anticipated GHQ Air Force, but only one, the 9th Observation, was formed. The 7th Bombardment and 8th Fighter Groups were designated but not activated until the end of the decade.

===National Defense Act of 1920===
&quot;Sect. 13a. There is hereby created an Air Service. The Air Service shall consist of one Chief of Air Service with the rank of major-general, one assistant with the rank of brigadier-general, 1,514 officers in grades from colonel to second lieutenant, inclusive, and 16,000 enlisted men, including not to exceed 2,500 flying cadets...&quot; — Section 13a, Public Law 242, 41 &quot;Stat&quot;. 759&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passage of the National Defense Act, June 4, 1920 (Public Law 66-242, 41 &quot;Stat&quot;. 759-88), the Air Service was statutorily recognized as a combatant arm of the line along with the Infantry, Cavalry, Field Artillery, Coast Artillery, Corps of Engineers, and Signal Corps, and given a permanent organization with a fixed complement of personnel. However this also legislated the form of the Air Service to that desired by the General Staff to maintain the aviation arm as an auxiliary component controlled by ground commanders in furtherance of the mission of the infantry.

A &quot;Chief of Air Service&quot; was authorized with the rank of major general to replace the previous &quot;Director of Air Service&quot;, and an assistant chief created in the rank of brigadier general (from 1920 to 1925 this position was held by Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell). The primary missions of the Air Service were observation and pursuit aviation, and its tactical squadrons in the United States were controlled by the commanders of nine corps areas and three overseas departments created by the Act, primarily in support of the ground forces. The Chief of the Air Service retained command of training schools, depots, and support activities exempted from corps area control. The headquarters of the Air Service was housed in the Munitions Building in Washington, D.C., and consisted of an executive staff including the chiefs of the Finance and Medical Sections, and four divisions, each administered by a chief: Personnel Group, Information Group (Intelligence), Training and War Plans Group, and Supply Group.

The Air Service of 1925 numbered five airship companies, an airship service company, 32 tactical squadrons (eight pursuit, eight bombardment, two attack, and 14 observation), six school squadrons, and 11 service squadrons. Half of the pursuit and bombardment squadrons and three each of the observation and service squadrons were based outside the continental United States.

The General Staff produced a mobilization plan that in the event of war would create a field force of six armies, 18 corps, and 54 divisions. Each army would have an Air Service attack wing (one attack and two pursuit groups) and an observation group, each corps and division would have an observation squadron, and a seventh attack wing-observation group would be reserved for the Expeditionary Force&#x27;s general headquarters. A single bombardment group was planned, relegating bombardment to the most minor of roles. All aviation units would be under the command of ground officers at all levels. While promoting unity of command within the service as its most important principle, the plan obviated concentration of forces by its air units. This structure provided the principles by which the Air Service and Air Corps operated until 1935.
The principal pursuit planes of the Air Service were the MB-3 (50 in inventory), the MB-3A (200 acquired 1920–23), and the Curtiss PW-8/P-1 Hawk (48 acquired in 1924–25). The only bomber ordered in quantity was the Martin NBS-1 (130 ordered 1920–1922), the mass-produced version of the MB-2 bomber developed in 1920. Mitchell used the NBS-1 as the primary striking weapon during his demonstration in July 1921 off the Virginia coast that resulted in the sinking of the captured German battleship &quot;Ostfriesland&quot;.

Aeronautical development became the responsibility of the Technical Section, Air Service, created January 1, 1919, consolidating the Aircraft Engineering Department BAP, the Technical Section DMA, and the Testing Squadron at Wilbur Wright Field, which was renamed the Engineering Division on March 19 and relocated to McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio.

A formal training establishment was also created by the Air Service on February 25, 1920, when the War Department authorized the establishment of service schools. Flying training, originally at Carlstrom Field in Florida and March Field in California, moved to Texas, divided between the 11th School Group (primary flying training) at Brooks Field and the 10th School Group (advanced flying training) at Kelly Field. A technical school for mechanics was located at Chanute Field, Illinois. The Air Service Tactical School was set up at Langley Field, Virginia, to train officers for higher command and to instruct in doctrine and the employment of military aviation. The Engineering Division created an air engineering school at McCook Field and moved it to Wright Field when that base was established in 1924.

==Debate over an independent Air Force==

===Framing the issues===
The seven-year history of the post-war Air Service was essentially a prolonged debate between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services about the value of an independent Air Force, spurred by the creation of the Royal Air Force in 1918. On one side were Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell, Brig. Gen. Benjamin Foulois, a cadre of young former Reserve officers who made up the overwhelming majority of Army pilots, and a few like-minded politicians and newspapers. Opposed were the General Staff of the Army, its senior leadership from World War I, and the Navy. Congress seemed sympathetic to the airpower advocates, but legislators consistently voted against them, to conserve the status quo. The doctrinal differences between the military services were both defined and intensified by struggles for funds caused by the skimpy budgets authorized for the War Department, first by the penurious policies of the Republican administrations in the 1920s, and then by the fiscal realities of the Great Depression.

While this debate focused largely on the controversial Mitchell, its early star was Foulois. Both returned from France with combat leadership experience in aviation, expecting to become the peacetime leaders of the Air Service. Instead, the War Department appointed Maj. Gen. Charles Menoher, who had commanded the Rainbow Division in France, to be Director of the Air Service to replace Secretary Ryan, signaling to the nation and the airpower proponents its intent to keep the air arm under the direction of the ground forces. Foulois was reduced to his permanent establishment rank of captain and assigned to head a minor agency. Mitchell received the vacant position of Director of Military Aeronautics, but its responsibilities had been transferred to Menoher by Executive Order 3066 to end the dual status mess of the DMA and BAP, and his position was titular only. Instead he became Third Assistant Executive (in effect, S-3), chief of the new Training and Operations Group, where he installed like-minded airmen who had served with him France as division heads and used the position to expound his theories.

In 1919, Mitchell proposed a Cabinet-level Department of Aviation equal to the War and Navy Departments to control all aviation, including sea-based air, airmail, and commercial operations. His goal was not only independent and centralized control of airpower, but also encouragement of the peacetime U.S. aviation industry. Mitchell insisted that the debate be both &quot;broad and civil&quot;. Foulois, however, complained bitterly to the United States Congress about the historical neglect and indifference of the Army to its air service. Although two bills to create Mitchell&#x27;s proposed department were introduced, in the Senate by Sen. Harry S. New of Indiana and in the House by Rep. Charles F. Curry of California, and initially garnered strong support, the opposition of the Army&#x27;s wartime leaders (especially General Pershing) frustrated the effort at the start. In August 1919 Gen. Menoher was assigned to chair a board consisting of himself and three other generals, all artillery officers and former infantry division commanders, appointed to report back to Congress on the proposed legislation. In October it predictably argued that unity of command and conformity to Army discipline overrode all other considerations. Support for the New and Curry bills evaporated and resulted in the passage of the less radical National Defense Act of 1920 conforming to the desires of the General Staff.

Mitchell was not discouraged by the failure of his first proposal. He recognized the value of public opinion in the debate and changed tactics, embarking on a publicity campaign on behalf of military aviation. General Menoher, when he was unable to persuade Secretary of War John Wingate Weeks to silence Mitchell, resigned his position on October 4, 1921, and was replaced by Maj.Gen. Mason Patrick. Although an engineer and not an aviator, Patrick had been Pershing&#x27;s Chief of Air Service in France, where his primary duty had been to coordinate the activities of Foulois and Mitchell, then rivals. Patrick had also testified before Congress against Mitchell&#x27;s plan for an independent air force.

Patrick was not hostile to aviation, however. He underwent flight training and obtained his wings, then issued a series of reports to the War Department emphasizing the need to expand and modernize the Air Service. In his first annual report in 1922, he warned that the Air Service had been degraded by budget cuts to the degree that it could no longer meet its peacetime obligations, much less mobilize for war. In one of the Air Service&#x27;s first inclusions in the army&#x27;s promotion system after becoming a combatant arm, among the 669 lieutenant colonels on the 1922 candidate list for colonel, the first Air Service member (James E. Fechet) was 354th. Patrick supported and issued the first air doctrine for the service, &quot;Fundamental Conceptions&quot; (patterned on Army Training Regulation 10-5 &quot;Doctrines Principles and Methods&quot;), which outlined strategy and tactics for the air arm. Patrick was also critical of the policy that placed air units under the command of corps commanders and proposed that only observation squadrons should be part of the ground forces, with all combat forces centralized under the control of an air force attached to General Headquarters.

===Investigating committees and boards===
The response to the proposal was three boards and committees. The Secretary of War convened the &quot;Lassiter Board&quot; in 1923, composed of general staff officers who fully endorsed Patrick&#x27;s views, and adopted the policy in regulations. The War Department acknowledged the necessity of improving its Air Service and desired to implement the Lassiter Board&#x27;s recommendations, which it termed &quot;Major Project No. 4&quot;, but the Coolidge administration proved a major obstacle, choosing to economize by radically cutting military budgets, particularly the Army&#x27;s. Patrick&#x27;s proposal that appropriations for the Air Service be coordinated with the larger budget of Naval aviation (in effect, shared), was rejected by the Navy, and the reorganization could not be implemented.

The U.S. House of Representatives then appointed the &quot;Lampert Committee&quot; in October 1924 to investigate Patrick&#x27;s criticisms. Mitchell testified before the committee and, upset by the failure of the War Department to even negotiate with the Navy in order to save the reforms of the Lassiter Board, harshly criticized Army leadership and attacked other witnesses. He had already antagonized the flag and general officers of both services with speeches and articles delivered in 1923 and 1924, and the Army refused to retain him as Assistant Chief of the Air Service when his term expired in March 1925. He was reduced in rank to colonel by Secretary Weeks and exiled to the Eighth Corps Area in San Antonio as air officer, where his continuing, reckless, and increasingly strident criticisms prompted President Calvin Coolidge to order his court-martial. Mitchell&#x27;s conviction on December 17, 1925, followed by three days the Lampert Committee&#x27;s recommendations for creation of a unified air force independent of the Army and Navy; creation of &quot;assistant secretaries for air&quot; in the War, Navy, and Commerce Departments; and establishment of a Department of National Defense.

The third board was the &quot;Morrow Board&quot;, a &quot;blue ribbon&quot; panel convened by President Coolidge in September 1925 to make a general inquiry into U.S. aviation. Headed by an investment banker and personal friend of Coolidge&#x27;s, Dwight Morrow, the board was made up of a federal judge, the head of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, former military officers now in industry, and the wartime head of the Board of Aircraft Production. The actual purpose of the Morrow Board was to minimize the political impact of the Mitchell trial, and Coolidge directed that it issue its findings by the end of November, to pre-empt the findings of not only the military court but also of the Lampert Committee that might be contrary to the Morrow Board. Its report was released on December 3. The major result of the Morrow Board was to maintain the status quo. It also made the recommendation, adopted in 1926, that the Air Service be renamed the &quot;Air Corps&quot;, but in doing so Congress denied it the autonomy enjoyed by the Marine Corps within the Navy Department, and thus the change was only cosmetic and the Air Corps remained as an auxiliary arm to the ground forces.

==Advances in aviation==


To positively influence U.S. public opinion and thereby enlist political support in Congress in his crusade for an independent air force, General Mitchell conducted a publicity campaign on behalf of airpower. On August 14, 1919, the All American Pathfinders, a provisional squadron, began a cross-country educational tour that supported the &quot;1919 Air Service Transcontinental Recruiting Convoy&quot; from Hazelhurst Field to California. While using public pronouncements for propaganda purposes, Mitchell also fostered within the Air Service advances in aeronautical science that would not only increase its effectiveness as a military service, but would also generate public support.

To further promote the air service, and to recruit pilots, in 1919 General Mitchell ordered a mission to fly around the border of the continental United States. Commanded by Col. Rutherford Hartz, and piloted by Lt. Ernest Emery Harmon, &quot;The Around The Rim Flight&quot; took off from Bolling Field in Washington, D.C., on July 24, 1919. The crew of five also included Lotha Smith, Jack Harding, and Gerosala Dobias. The first circumnavigation of the country by air was successfully completed with the landing of their Martin MB1 back at Bolling Field on Nov 9, 1919.

Mitchell&#x27;s first project, undertaken at McCook Field, in Dayton, Ohio, was for the creation of a heavily armored attack plane for supporting ground forces. Although the designs that resulted were not practical and did not meet Mitchell&#x27;s specifications for aircraft that could land troops behind enemy lines, the project led Mitchell to closely supervise aircraft development, not only at McCook but in Europe as well. On October 30, 1919, the McCook Field engineers tested the first reversible-pitch propeller.

This effort resulted in the development of a monoplane with retractable landing gear, a metal propeller, and a streamlined engine design, the Verville R-3 Racer. Economy measures by the Air Service prevented the project from being fully completed, but contributed to a growing determination within the Air Service to set new aviation records for speed, altitude, distance, and endurance, which in turn contributed not only to technical improvements (and favorable publicity) but also advancements in aviation medicine.

Air Service pilots established world records in altitude, distance, and speed. Speed in particular attracted public attention and, although a number of speed records were set in cross-country flying, records were also set on measured courses. Mitchell himself set a world speed record of over a closed course in a Curtiss R-6 racer on October 18, 1922, at the Pulitzer Trophy competition of the 1922 National Air Races. A later world speed record of was made by 1st Lt. James H. Doolittle in winning the Schneider Trophy race at the 1925 Races.

The practical and military applications of speed were not ignored, however. On February 24, 1921, 1st Lt. William D. Coney of the 91st Aero Squadron completed a transcontinental flight of 22.5 hours flying time from Rockwell Field, California, to Pablo Beach, Florida, in a DeHavilland DH-4, which carried enough fuel for 14 hours of flight. However he had left Rockwell on February 21 intending to complete the flight within 24 hours, making just one stop in Dallas, Texas, but was thwarted by bad weather and engine problems. One month later, taking off at 1:00 a.m. of March 25, he repeated the attempt going in the opposite direction, but developed engine problems while flying low in a fog near Crowville, Louisiana, southeast of Monroe. He crashed into a tree trying to land and was severely injured, dying five days later in a Natchez, Mississippi hospital.

On September 4, 1922, Doolittle completed the first transcontinental crossing in a single day, from Pablo Beach to Rockwell Field, in 21 hours, 20 minutes, a distance of flying a DH-4 of the 90th Squadron. Mitchell concluded that accomplishing the same feat by &quot;daylight only&quot;, making only a single stop at Kelly Field, had tremendous value, and staged a dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the United States in the summer of 1924 in a Curtiss Curtiss PW-8 fighter developed from the R-6 for that purpose.

Despite the emphasis in the press on speed, the Air Service also established a number of altitude, distance, and endurance records. The Packard-Le Peré LUSAC-11 biplane set world altitude records over McCook Field of on February 27, 1920, by Maj. Rudolph W. Schroeder; and on September 28, 1921, by Lt. John A. Macready. A distance record was set by Capt. St. Clair Streett leading a flight of four DH-4s from Mitchel Field, New York to Nome, Alaska and back, a distance of 8,690 miles (14,000 km), between July 15 and October 20, 1920. Flying across the northern United States and southern Canada in 15 legs, the flight reached Nome on August 23 in 56 hours of flying time, but was prohibited by the U.S. State Department from completing the first flight to Asia across the Bering Strait. The first nonstop endurance flight across the U.S., made in 26 hours and 50 minutes at an average speed of 98.76 mph, was made May 2–3, 1923, from Roosevelt Field, New York, to Rockwell Field in a Fokker T-2 transport monoplane by Macready and Lt. Oakley G. Kelly. The feat was followed in August by a flight in which a DH-4 stayed aloft for more than 37 hours by means of aerial refueling. The Fokker T-2 is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

The greatest achievement of these projects, however, was the first flight around the world. The Air Service set up support facilities along the proposed route and in April 1924 sent a flight of four aircraft west from Seattle, Washington. Six months later, two aircraft completed the flight. Even if considered as primarily a publicity stunt, the flight was a brilliant accomplishment in which five nations had already failed.

Kelly and Macready, Doolittle, and the crews of the circumnavigation flight all won the Mackay Trophy for the respective years in which they accomplished their feats.

<doc id="662932" wikidata="Q198287" url="?curid=662932" title="Colchester Castle">
<text>Colchester Castle is a Norman castle in Colchester, Essex, England, dating from the second half of the eleventh century. The keep of the castle is mostly intact and is the largest example of its kind anywhere in Europe, due to its being built on the foundations of the Roman Temple of Claudius. The castle endured a three-month siege in 1216, but had fallen into disrepair by the seventeenth century when the curtain walls and some of the keep&#x27;s upper parts were demolished; its original height is debated. The remaining structure was used as a prison and was partially restored as a large garden pavilion, but was purchased by Colchester Borough Council in 1922. The castle has, since 1860, housed Colchester Museum, which has an important collection of Roman exhibits. It is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.

== Construction ==
The attribution of the castle as a royal foundation is based on a charter of Henry I dated 1101, granting the town and castle of Colchester to Eudo Dapifer &quot;as my father had them and my brother and myself&quot;, Henry&#x27;s father and brother being William I, &quot;William the Conqueror&quot;, and William II, &quot;William Rufus&quot;. The somewhat unreliable &quot;Colchester Chronicle&quot;, written in the late 13th century, credits Eudo with the construction of the castle and gives a commencement date of 1076. The design of the castle has been associated with Gundulf of Rochester purely on the basis of the similarities between Colchester and the White Tower at the Tower of London; however, both keeps also resemble the much earlier example at Château d&#x27;Ivry-la-Bataille in Upper Normandy.

=== Construction of the keep ===

At one and a half times the size of the ground plan of the White Tower, Colchester&#x27;s keep of has the largest area of any medieval tower built in Britain or in Europe. The enormous size of the keep was dictated by the decision to use the masonry base or podium of the Temple of Claudius, built between AD 49 and 60, which was the largest Roman temple in Britain. The site is on high ground at the western end of the walled town and at the time of the Norman Conquest, a Saxon chapel and other buildings which may have constituted a royal vill lay close by the ruins of the temple. The obvious motive for reusing this site was the ready made foundations and the availability of Roman building materials in an area without any naturally occurring stone. Another factor may have been that the Normans like to see themselves as imperial successors to the Romans, William being frequently compared by his biographer, William of Poitiers, to Julius Caesar and his barons to the Roman Senate. The &quot;Colchester Chronicle&quot; described the temple site as a palace built by the mythical Roman-era King Coel; either way, it was providing a provenance for the Norman occupiers as the inheritors of a heroic past. Siting the castle so close to the centre of the town makes Colchester the exception to the rule that Norman castles were built as a part of the town&#x27;s external defences, with access to open countryside.

The initial preparation of the site involved the demolition of surviving superstructure of the Roman temple, resulting in a layer of mortar rubble at the Norman ground level. The walls of the keep sit on narrow foundation trenches filled with rubble and mortar, and directly abut the edge of the Roman podium, except in the south where they are set back to avoid the original temple steps and to facilitate the digging of a well. The walls are made of coursed rubble, including septaria and Roman brick robbed from nearby ruins. Ashlar dressings are of Barnack and other stone, as well as Roman tile and brick. A large apse projects from the south-east corner, resembling St John&#x27;s Chapel in the White Tower but there is no firm evidence that a similar chapel ever existed at Colchester. It has been speculated that an apse was added to the Temple of Claudius in the 4th century during a putative conversion to a Christian church and that the Normans followed this outline. The keep was divided internally by a wall running from north to south; a second dividing wall was added to the larger eastern section at a later date.
Initially, the keep was only built to the height of the first floor; remnants of the crenellations which surmounted this first phase can still be seen in the exterior walls. It seems likely that either a financial or military crisis dictated that the partly completed keep had to be made defensible. A Danish raid in support of the Revolt of the Earls in 1075 or the threatened invasion by Canute IV in 1085 have both have been suggested as possible causes. Another theory is that only a single-story structure was originally intended. The keep today has only two storeys; the original height is unknown because of demolition work carried out in the late 17th century. In 1882, J. Horace Round proposed that, like the White Tower, Colchester would have had four storeys, with a double-height great hall and chapel. This view was widely accepted throughout most of the 20th century. More recently, researchers have supported a three-storey model and some of the latest work suggests that there may have only ever been two storeys.

This is based on pre-demolition depictions of the castle, which despite errors and inconsistencies, all show the squat profile evident today rather than an immensely tall three- or four-storey tower, also the short time frame in which demolition can have occurred, and finally analysis of various surviving internal details which suggest that, unlike the White Tower, the great hall was on the first floor. Further uncertainty surrounds the position of the original entrance; the current main doorway in the southwestern tower dates from the second phase of construction which saw the addition of the first floor and staircases. Architectural features suggest that this second phase was undertaken after about 1100, probably by Eudo following the charter of 1101. In the mid-13th century, a masonry barbican was built adjacent to the south-west tower to protect the main doorway, replacing an earlier forebuilding.

=== Construction of the bailey ===

The defences of the bailey consisted principally of a large earthen rampart and ditch surrounding the keep, the northern section of which survives but was heavily landscaped in the 19th century. Archaeological evidence has found that these embankments were thrown up over the remains of the Roman wall of the temple precinct and on the northern side were probably constructed at the same time as the first phase of the keep. The rampart to the north-east was wide by high. The southern embankment seems to have been completed during the second phase of keep construction around 1100. Inside the bailey, a late Anglo-Saxon chapel stood close to the southern edge of the keep and a domestic hall to the southeast of, and aligned with the chapel, were both retained during the first phase of keep construction.

The chapel was rebuilt during the second phase and the hall had a large fireplace added at around the same time. A weak lower or &quot;nether&quot; bailey was formed by two less substantial bank-and-ditch barriers which extended northwards as far as the town walls. This may be the &quot;new bailey&quot; mentioned in 1173, or perhaps the masonry walls of the main or &quot;upper&quot; bailey which were in place by 1182. No trace of the stone walls has been found, which suggests that were located at the top of the rampart. A twin-towered gatehouse gave access to the bailey in its southwest corner, probably built at the same time as the bailey walls, although there is no mention of it until the 1240s; it was approached by a bridge over the ditch. A palisade, presumably part of the nether bailey defences, blew down in 1218 and again in 1237, and further repairs to it were needed in 1275–76.

== Later history ==
=== Medieval ===

Control of Colchester Castle reverted to the crown following the death of Eudo in 1120 and thereafter, the castle was governed by crown-appointed constables, or was in the care of the High Sheriff of Essex when no-one had that role. In 1190, the acquisition of 26 military tunics for the castle are evidence of a permanent garrison. Kings Henry I, Henry II and Henry III are all known to have visited the castle.

In 1214, the hereditary constable was William de Lanvalai, who was one of the barons opposed to King John. In November of that year, John arrived at Colchester, probably in an unsuccessful attempt to win over Lanvalai, who shortly afterwards left the castle in the care of the sheriff and joined the other rebel barons at Bury St Edmunds. Meanwhile, John sent a replacement constable to Colchester, Stephen Harengood, who was probably a Flemish mercenary, with orders to improve the castle&#x27;s defences. The barons later marched on London, forcing John to accept the Magna Carta at Runnymede in June 1215, which included a provision that Colchester be returned to Lanvalai. Within months, John had refused to be bound by the terms of the charter and the First Barons&#x27; War broke out.

John besieged Rochester Castle before sending an army towards Colchester, under the command of a French mercenary called Savary de Meuleon. In the meantime, the barons had appealed for help to King Louis VIII of France and accordingly, a French contingent had arrived to garrison Colchester Castle for the barons. The siege began in January 1216 and ended in March when King John himself arrived; the French garrison of 116 men were able to negotiate a safe passage to London. although that didn&#x27;t prevent them from being arrested there. Following the capture of Colchester, Harengood was reinstated as constable and made sheriff, but in 1217, the castle was handed-over to the French and the barons as part of a truce agreement. However, it was recovered by the boy king Henry III in the Treaty of Lambeth in September 1217 which finally ended the war, and William of Sainte-Mère-Église, the Bishop of London, was made constable.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
In 1607 custody of the castle was granted for life to Charles, Baron Stanhope of Harrington (1593–1675). In 1624 Stanhope granted the lease to Thomas Holmes, gentleman and maltster, the father of John Holmes, who emigrated to Plymouth Colony and became Messenger of the Court there. Custody of the castle, the bailey, and King&#x27;s Meadow north of the river Colne remained in the Holmes family until after 1659. In 1629 Charles I alienated the reversion of the castle to James Hay, Earl of Carlisle, which passed in 1636 to Archibald Hay. In 1649 Hay sold his interest to Sir John Lenthall, while in 1650 a Parliament Survey condemned the building and valued the stone at five pounds. In 1656 Lenthall sold his interest to Sir James Norfolk or Northfolk, who finally bought out Stanhope&#x27;s interest in 1662. In 1683 an ironmonger, John Wheely, was licensed to pull it all down - presumably to use as building material in the town. After &quot;great devastations&quot; in which much of the upper structure was demolished using screws and gunpowder, he gave up when the operation became unprofitable.

The castle has had various uses since it ceased to be a royal castle. It has been a county prison, where in 1645 the self-styled Witchfinder General, Matthew Hopkins interrogated and imprisoned suspected witches. In 1648, during the Second English Civil War, the Royalist leaders Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle were executed just to the rear of the castle. Local legend has it that grass will not grow on the spot on which they fell. A small obelisk now marks the point. In 1656 the Quaker James Parnell was martyred there.

In 1705 Wheely sold the castle to Sir Isaac Rebow, who left it to his grandson Charles Chamberlain Rebow in 1726. In 1727 the castle was bought by Mary Webster for her daughter Sarah, who was married to Charles Gray, the Member of Parliament for Colchester. To begin with, Gray leased the keep to a local grain merchant and the east side was leased to the county as a gaol. In the late 1740s Gray restored parts of the building, in particular the south front. He created a private park around the ruin and his summer house (perched on the old Norman castle earthworks, in the shape of a Roman temple) can still be seen. He also added a library with large windows and a cupola on the south-east tower, which was completed in 1760. On Gray&#x27;s death in 1782, the castle passed to his step-grandson, James Round, who continued the restoration work.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

The part of the castle under the chapel remained in use as a gaol, which was enlarged in 1801. A long-serving gaoler called John Smith lived on site with his family. His daughter Mary Ann Smith was born there in 1777 and lived her whole life in the castle, becoming the librarian until her death in 1852. She is believed to have planted the sycamore tree which is still growing on top of the southwest tower, either to celebrate the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 or to mark her father&#x27;s death in the same year.

Between 1920 and 1922, the Castle and the associated parkland were bought by the Borough of Colchester using a large donation from Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, a wealthy industrialist who had been the town&#x27;s Member of Parliament. The wrought iron gates at the entrance to the park on Cowdray Crescent were created in Cheltenham by H.H. Martyn &amp; Co.. The Park is split into the Upper and Lower Castle Parks. A museum of artefacts owned by the borough had been on display at the castle since 1860, and the roofing over of the keep in the mid-1930s allowed for a considerable expansion. Between January 2013 and May 2014 the castle museum underwent extensive refurbishment costing £4.2 million. The programme of work improved and updated the displays with the latest research into the castle&#x27;s history, and supported the repair of the roof.

== Ownership ==
The later inheritance of the castle and its grounds is illustrated below. Only those greyed out did not at some time own the building. Though Charles Gray Round died before the area was sold to the corporation of Colchester, his will ensured that it was held in trust with that eventual purpose.

<text>Clifford Osbourne Jarvis (August 26, 1941 – November 26, 1999) was an American hard bop and free jazz drummer, who in the 1980s moved to London, England, where he spent the remainder of his career.

==Biography==
Clifford Jarvis, the son of Malcom “Shorty” Jarvis was born in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, where he studied at Berklee College of Music in the 1950s.

Moving to New York City, he established himself in jazz between 1959 and 1966, by recording with bebop and hard-bop musicians including Randy Weston, Yusef Lateef, Freddie Hubbard, Barry Harris, Jackie McLean, John Patton, Chet Baker, Kenny Drew, Walter Davis, and Elmo Hope, and playing with Grant Green and Rahsaan Roland Kirk.

He worked and recorded with musicians associated with free jazz, including Sun Ra (from 1962 to 1976), Pharoah Sanders, Sonny Simmons, Alice Coltrane, and Archie Shepp.

During the 1980s, Jarvis moved to England, where he played with younger musicians including Courtney Pine. He also worked as a music educator at Chats Palace Arts Centre in London and Pyramid Arts Development in Dalston. Jarvis continued teaching until his death in 1999.

<text>Kemijärvi (; ; ) is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located in the sub-region of Eastern Lapland.

== History ==
The first permanent settler inhabitant of Kemijärvi was Paavali Ollinpoika Halonen, who moved from the region of Oulu, from Niskakylä, Utajärvi to Kemijärvi about 1580. His wife was Anna Laurintytär Halonen, and their children were Paavo, Olli and Pekka Halonen. Paavali&#x27;s place of residence is known today as Halosenranta. As the first settlers moved to Kemijärvi, the area was no longer inhabited exclusively by the Sami people, but Ämmänvaara in the area of the municipality is an ancient sacrificial place of Samis.

The railway reached Kemijärvi in 1934. It was extended north to Salla and what is now Russia during World War II, though the line is currently moribund beyond Kemijärvi. Kemijärvi railway station has passenger train service to Rovaniemi, Oulu and Helsinki. The direct overnight train service between Kemijärvi and Helsinki was controversially withdrawn in September 2006, with VR (Finnish Railways) stating that its new sleeping car trains could not operate with the diesel locomotives needed for the (then) non-electrified railway north of Rovaniemi.

However, a year later, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR reached an agreement concerning partial public funding of the service, which was restored in 2008 with a diesel generator car supplying head-end power to the passenger cars. The generator car disappeared from the train in March 2014 when the electrification extension from Rovaniemi to Kemijärvi was inaugurated, an event which also assured Kemijärvi a permanent place in the VR network.

On 9 May 1986, a BAE Hawk Mk 51 crashed in Kemijärvi whilst practising for a flight display due to loss of orientation. The pilot, First Lieutenant M. Kähkönen, died upon impact.

== Geography ==

<text>Kolari is a municipality of Finland at the Swedish border, which follows the Torne River, the longest free-flowing river in Europe.

It is located in the region of Lapland. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Neighbouring municipalities are Muonio, Pello, Kittilä, Rovaniemi in Finland and Pajala Municipality in Sweden.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Kolari railway station is the northernmost station in Finland.

Ylläs, one of the most popular ski resorts in Finland, is located in Kolari. The area also features the country&#x27;s largest bog with a thousand-year-old forest.
== History ==
The first permanent settler in the area was a Savonian named Pekka Kolari, arriving in the area in the early 1580s. He originated from Konnevesi, which was a part of the Rautalampi parish at the time. The island named &quot;Kolarinsaari&quot; near the village of Istunmäki was likely his original home, as the Savonian surname &quot;Kolari&quot; originates from the same island.

The area of Kolari was a part of the Pajala parish, which is in modern Sweden. Kolari started growing in the 17th century due to the nearby Kengis (Köngäs) ironworks established in 1644. Kolari was home to many skilled blacksmiths. Charcoal, tar and chalk were produced and delivered to Tornio.
After Russia gained Finland in 1809, it was transferred to the Turtola parish, modern Pello. As the winter market could no longer be held in Kengis due to the new border, they were held on the island of Kolarinsaari in the Tornio river. Kolari became a chapel community in 1856 and a separate parish in 1894.

<text>Muonio (previously called &quot;Muonionniska&quot;; ) is a municipality of Finland. The town is located in fell-region of far northern Finland above the Arctic Circle on the country&#x27;s western border with Sweden, the Muonio River. It lies within the area of the former Lappi (Lapland) province in the Fell Lapland subregion. The next closest Finnish municipalities are Enontekiö to the north, Kittilä on the east, and Kolari to the south. Southwest of the town, a road bridge crosses the Muonio River, across the river, in Sweden, lies the nearby hamlet of Muoniovaara (&quot;Muonio hill&quot;) in northern Pajala Municipality in Norrbotten County.

The area has been occupied by humans for at least 10,000 years; their arrival is thought to have coincided with deglaciation at the end of the Younger Dryas. They likely arrived from the south or east, since the Scandinavian Mountains rise 2,100 metres on the west, and over 1,300 metres to the north - both form a significant barrier to migration. Remains of eight dwellings from the Middle Stone Age have been excavated on the shore of Lake Akajarvi (fifteen miles from the center of the present-day village).

Prior to the historical period (c.1500 AD) archeological findings in the area are consistent with those known to be of Sámi peoples. Muonio (then called Muonionniska) first appears in written records in the mid-1500s in records of fishing-rights claims and disputes between Sámi indigenes and Finnish pioneer-hunters and fishermen.

The municipality today has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . The municipality is unilingually Finnish, unlike many towns on the Finland–Sweden border.

Muonio is good base for exploring the many things to do in the area; it offers a variety of accommodations and commercial supply establishments and is on the E8 highway which goes north to Kilpisjärvi. International air flights and train service terminate at Kittilä; local bus service connects to Muonio. Other busses will take you to Rovaniemi, Helsinki, or even to Tromsø, Norway. Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park is nearby and offers year-round activities.

Muonio is known as the municipality with the longest snow season in Finland. For that reason its vocational college has a top ski class that attracts aspiring cross-country ski champions from all over Finland. The &quot;midnight sun&quot; is above the horizon from 27 May to 17 July (52 days), and the period with continuous daylight is during this time. The period of continuous night, polar night, lasts from 10 December to 2 January (24 days).

The villages in Muonio include:
* Ylimuonio

<text>The Auckland Harbour Bridge is an eight-lane motorway bridge over Waitematā Harbour in Auckland, New Zealand. It joins St Marys Bay on the Auckland city side with Northcote on the North Shore side. It is part of State Highway 1 and the Auckland Northern Motorway. The bridge is operated by the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA). It is the second-longest road bridge in New Zealand, and the longest in the North Island.

The original inner four lanes, opened in 1959, are of box truss construction. Two lanes were added to each side in 1968–1969 and are of orthotropic box structure construction extend as cantilevers from the original piers. The bridge is 1,020 m (3,348 ft) long, with a main span of 243.8 metres (800 feet) rising 43.27 metres (142 feet) above high water, allowing ships access to the deepwater wharf at the Chelsea Sugar Refinery, one of the few such wharves west of the bridge.

While often considered an Auckland icon, many see the construction of the bridge without walking, cycling, or rail facilities as an oversight. In 2016, an add-on structure providing a walk-and-cycleway called SkyPath received Council funding approval and planning consent, but was not built. In 2021, a stand-alone walking and cycling bridge called the Northern Pathway was announced by the New Zealand Government, but also was not built.

About 170,000 vehicles cross the bridge each day (as of 2019), including over 1,000 buses, which carry 38% of all people crossing during the morning peak.

==Background==
Prior to the opening of the bridge in 1959, the quickest way from Auckland to the North Shore was by passenger or vehicular ferry. By road, the shortest route was via the Northwestern Motorway (then complete only between Great North Road and Lincoln Road), Massey, Riverhead, and Albany, a distance of approximately .

As early as 1860, engineer Fred Bell, commissioned by North Shore farmers who wanted to herd animals to market in Auckland, had proposed a harbour crossing in the general vicinity of the bridge. It would have used floating pontoons, but the plan failed due to the £16,000 cost estimate ($1.9 million, adjusted for inflation as of March 2017). Additional structures for a bridge crossing the harbour were proposed in 1927 and 1929.

In the 1950s, when the bridge was being built, North Shore was a mostly rural area of barely 50,000 people, with few jobs and a growth rate half that of Auckland south of the Waitematā Harbour. Opening up the area via a new route unlocked the potential for further expansion of Auckland.

==Construction==

===Initial structure===

The recommendations of the design team and the report of the 1946 Royal Commission were for five or six traffic lanes, with one or two of them to be reversed in direction depending on the flow of traffic, and with a footpath for pedestrians on each side. The latter features were dropped for cost reasons before construction started, the First National Government of New Zealand opting for an &#x27;austerity&#x27; design of four lanes without footpaths, and including an approach road network only after local outcry over traffic effects. The decision to reduce the bridge in this way has been called &quot;a ringing testament to [...] the peril of short-term thinking and penny-pinching&quot;. On 1 December 1950, an act of parliament formed the Auckland Harbour Bridge Authority, chaired by Sir John Allum, then Mayor of Auckland City, who appointed British firm Freeman Fox &amp; Partners to design the bridge.

The bridge took four years to build, with Dorman Long (who had constructed the Sydney Harbour Bridge) and the Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company contracted to construct the bridge in October 1954. The first stage of construction involved land reclamation at the Westhaven Marina, which was completed by September 1955. The steel girder structure pieces were fabricated in England and shipped to New Zealand. The steel bridge structure began erection in December 1956. Hundreds of labourers were employed on the construction including 180 men sent out from the UK. Progress was slowed with the workers going on strike in 1956 and 1957. The large steel girder sections were partially pre-assembled, then floated into place on construction barges. One of the main spans was almost lost during stormy weather when the barge began to drift, but the tugboat &quot;William C Daldy&quot; won a 36-hour tug-of-war against the high winds.

The bridge was constructed from opposing sides of the harbour. The southern section was cantilevered, until both sides were joined in March 1959. Completed in April 1959, three weeks ahead of schedule, the bridge was officially opened on 30 May 1959 by the Governor-General Lord Cobham. An open day had been held, when 106,000 people had walked across. The opening period was extremely busy, despite the poor weather in Auckland experienced in June 1959. Either three or four men had been killed by accidents during construction, and the names of three of them are recorded on a memorial plaque underneath the bridge at the Northcote end.

The hollow girder design by Freeman, Fox and Partners design was unprecedented in New Zealand, and fell outside the 1950s building codes in New Zealand. Initial plans for the bridge were for an extremely slender structure, only 2.9 metres thick, due to the competing specifications from two stakeholders: the National Roads Board specified the gradient and locations where the bridge could launch from the shore on either side of the harbour, while the Auckland Harbour Board required an opening of 43.5 metres above the high tide point. Public Works commissioner Bob Norman, concerned about the narrow bridge design, attempted to negotiate with both the Roads Board and Harbour Board for additional width allowance for the bridge. The Harbour Board required the 43.5 metre clearance so that the entire fleet of ships operating within New Zealand could navigate the harbour, the largest of which was the P&amp;O cruise liner SS &quot;Canberra&quot;. Norman argued that the &quot;Canberra&quot; was extremely unlikely to use the only major dock west of the bridge at the Chelsea Sugar Refinery, so the Harbour Board agreed to a smaller opening. This allowed Freeman Fox and Partners to redesign the bridge, increasing the width of the deep centre span from 2.9 metres to 4.12 metres. By the 1970s, many box girder bridges began to develop structural problems, such as the Freeman Fox and Partners-designed West Gate Bridge in Melbourne which collapsed during construction in 1970. The Auckland Harbour Bridge was inspected by the design firm, which found that the stiffening member had buckled by 61mm, so it was decided to strengthen the bridge&#x27;s girder system.

Paid for by government-backed loans, the bridge started out as a toll bridge, the first one in New Zealand, with toll booths at the northern end for north-bound and south-bound traffic. Tolls were originally 2/6 (2 shillings and six pence: approximately $5.50 in 2018) per car but were reduced to 2/- (2 shillings: approximately $4.47 in 2018) after 15 months of operation. The toll remained at 2 shillings until New Zealand changed to decimal currency in July 1967, when that amount became 20 cents in the conversion. It was increased in 1980 from 20 to 25 cents (approximately $1.21 in 2018). Tolling was later made north-bound only before being discontinued on 31 March 1984, and the booths were removed. The toll system was removed as the cost of collection began to outweigh the profits. When this happened, the Auckland Harbour Bridge Authority enquired if the National Roads Board would take over operations if the toll booths were removed, which they agreed to. When the bridge became toll free, most of the Auckland Harbour Bridge Authority staff were absorbed into the roads board.

Some critics have alleged that the routing of State Highway 1 over the bridge was motivated by the need to create toll revenue, and led to a decades-long delay on finishing the Western Ring Route around Auckland, significantly contributing to the need for a massive motorway through the city centre of Auckland and severely damaging inner-city suburbs such as Freemans Bay and Grafton.

===Clip-ons (&quot;Nippon clip-ons&quot;)===
The bridge was originally built with four lanes for traffic. Owing to the rapid expansion of suburbs on the North Shore and increasing traffic levels, it was soon necessary to increase capacity; by 1965, the annual use was about 10 million vehicles, three times the original forecast. In 1967, a contract was given to Japanese firm Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (now IHI Corporation) to construct two steel box girder bridges affixed to the Harbour Bridge, to greatly increase the number of lanes on the bridge. The girder sections were prefabricated in Japan and transported to New Zealand on a converted oil tanker. The eastern section was completed in January 1969, while the western side was completed shortly before the additional lanes were formally opened on 23 September 1969. Each side added two additional lanes to the bridge, doubling the number of lanes to eight.

As the sections were manufactured by a Japanese company, this led to the nickname &#x27;Nippon clip-ons&#x27;. The selection of the company was considered a bold move at the time, barely 20 years after WWII and with some considerable anti-Japanese sentiment still existing. The costs of the additions were much higher than if the extra lanes had been provided initially.

The clip-ons have been plagued by significant issues. In 1987, cracks required major repair works, and in 2006, further cracks and signs of material fatigue were found. The clip-ons were originally to have a life expectancy of 50 years. Auckland City Council&#x27;s Transport Committee requested Transit New Zealand to investigate the future of the clip-ons as part of its ten-year plan. Transit noted that the plan already includes some funding for bridge maintenance.

In May 2007, Transit proposed a by-law change banning vehicles over 4.5 tonnes from the outside lane on each clip-on to reduce stress on the structure. This was changed in July 2007 to a bylaw banning vehicles of 13 tonnes or more, based on the high level of voluntary compliance during the previous months.

In 2007, it was announced that NZ$45 million in maintenance work on the clip-ons was brought forward as part of good practice. In October 2007, a 2006 report from Beca Group surfaced in the press, noting that the clip-ons were at risk of catastrophic, immediate failure in circumstances such as a traffic jam trapping a large number of trucks. Transit noted that this situation was extremely unlikely, and measures already implemented would prevent it from occurring. In January 2008, it became known that even after the multimillion-dollar maintenance works, a full ban for trucks on all clip-on lanes might be required, or the working life could be reduced to only ten more years.

In late 2009, it was announced that due to greater than expected complexity of the task and increasing material costs for the 920 tons of reinforcing material instead of the approximately half amount of that originally envisaged, clip-on maintenance costs had increased by a further NZ$41 million. NZTA noted that the clip-ons would not be able to be strengthened again after the current works were finished. However, after completion of the upgrade, the bridge would have a further life of between 20 and 40 years if truck restrictions were reintroduced in 10–20 years on the northbound clip-on.

==Traffic==
=== Tidal flow ===
A &quot;tidal flow&quot; (dynamic lanes) system is in place, with the direction of the two centre lanes changed to provide an additional lane for peak-period traffic. During the morning peak, five of the eight lanes are for southbound traffic; in the afternoon, five lanes are northbound. At other times, the lanes are split evenly, but peak traffic has become proportionately less – in 1991 there was often a higher than 3:1 difference in directional traffic; in 2006, this had dropped to around 1.6:1. The bridge has an estimated capacity of 180,000 vehicles per day, and in 2006 had an average volume of 168,754 vehicles per day (up from 122,000 in 1991).

In March 1982, the Ministry of Transport and Auckland Harbour Bridge Authority conducted a week-long traffic blitz in an attempt to improve the standard of driving. Of the 600,000 vehicles which used the bridge over this period, 6,000 were stopped, with half of those receiving a ticket and the rest cautioned. A second blitz was held for 36 hours a few weeks later.

For many years, lane directions were indicated by overhead signals. In the late 1980s, a number of fatal head-on accidents occurred when vehicles crossed lane markings into the path of oncoming traffic.

==== Moveable barriers ====
In 1990, a movable concrete safety barrier was put in place to separate traffic heading in opposite directions and eliminate head-on accident. Two specially designed barrier transfer machines moved the barrier by one lane four times a day, at a speed of 6 km/h, the first concrete safety barrier of its kind installed on a box girder bridge in the world.

In March 2009, the barrier transfer machines, which had lasted four times their original design life of five years, and the barrier were replaced. The new machines are capable of moving the barrier in half the time the old machines did. The concrete barrier blocks and the metal expansion blocks have been reduced in width by 200 mm, giving more width in the lanes either side of the barrier.

As part of the Victoria Park Tunnel project, the moveable barrier has been extended southwards to the Fanshawe Street onramp.

=== Event management ===

As part of large events such as the Auckland Marathon, normal motorway restrictions on access are sometimes relaxed. December 2011 was the first time that cyclists were officially allowed on the bridge, for a race / community cycling event organised by Telstra Clear, Auckland Transport, NZTA and Cycle Action Auckland, also allowing cyclists on the Northern Busway. Up to 9,000 riders were protected by 160 stationary buses used as a &#x27;guard of honour&#x27; between the bridge end and the Northern Busway from traffic on the rest of the motorway.

== Proposed walk- and cycleway ==

===Original proposal===
When the bridge was built, rail lines and walking paths were dropped for cost reasons, and neither were they included during the clip-on construction (people can walk on the span only via guided tours). After the early 1990s increase in public transportation patronage in Auckland, the Ministry of Works and Development investigated if the &#x27;clip-ons&#x27; could be used for a light rail system, which they found was feasible if the lanes were used exclusively for this purpose. In 2007 discussions about the addition of a cycle and footpath link were mooted. Transit noted that this would cost between NZ$20 million and $40 million, but public support was polled as very high. The GetAcross group and Cycle Action Auckland (later rebranded to Bike Auckland) argued that lower-cost options were available, and that provision for a walk- and cycleway could relatively easily be included in the bridge strengthening works that were being planned for the clip-ons.

A 2008 proposal to modify the clip-ons and potentially widen them to add walking and cycling paths met with different reactions. While Auckland Regional Council and North Shore City Council voted to support it (under certain conditions), Auckland City Council considered the costs to be too high. Other stakeholders such as the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) considered the proposal as not having enough merit for the $22–53 million cost, though campaigners noted that the costs cited for the project included 45% contingencies. A proposal from the Auckland Regional Council (one of the proponents) to open up part of the clip-on structure for a walking / cycling trial use over several summer weekends, to show whether it would attract enough users, did not go forward.

The GetAcross group was showcasing its proposed walking/cycling solution, called SkyPath, on its website. Following years of campaigning a Harbour Bridge crossing, known as Skypath, was promised funding by the Labour Party in the lead-up to the 2017 general election. Once Labour was in government, the project was passed to the Waka Kotahi / NZ Transport Agency which released a revised design in 2019.

In July 2023 Bike Auckland released a report by SmartSense Limited, addressing key concerns about reallocating a lane on the motor bridge to walking and cycling, and proposing a design solution to mitigate safety concerns.

On 6 August 2023, Waka Kotahi announced their Waitematā Harbour Crossings plan which includes a tunnel for light rail and a tunnel for motor traffic under the Harbour, and walking and cycling on two lanes of the existing Harbour Bridge. Construction is expected to start by 2029. Waka Kotahi&#x27;s forecast is that 6400 people would walk and cycle across the Auckland Harbour Bridge every day.

Bike Auckland continues to advocate for Waka Kotahi to Liberate the Lane, stating that Waka Kotahi&#x27;s Waitematā connections project will take too long to deliver a walking and cycling connection across the Harbour. Their campaign has attracted the support of a diverse array of organisations, calling for Waka Kotahi to liberate the lane now to give Aucklanders more affordable and sustainable transport options, and that it would be a key symbol of climate action.

===Protests===
On Sunday, 24 May 2009, thousands of people crossed the bridge as a part of a protest by GetAcross against the bridge not providing walking and cycling access, and against what the group perceives to be the authorities&#x27; negative and obstructionist attitude towards such access. A crossing either as part of the protest or as part of the official 50-year anniversary celebrations had been forbidden by NZTA because of the costs and traffic difficulties claimed for a managed crossing. However, after several speeches, including by Auckland Regional Council Chairman Mike Lee, several people made their way around the police cordon onto the bridge. At that stage police closed the northbound lanes to traffic, bringing State Highway 1 to a stop. The remainder of the protesters moved onto the bridge, which was not resisted any more by the police. No accidents, violence or arrests were reported, and protesters left the bridge approximately an hour later, many having crossed to the North Shore and back.

The protest created a wide spectrum of responses in the media and in public perception, from being labelled a dangerous stunt representative of an increasingly lawless, anarchic society to being considered a successful signal to authorities to give more weight to the demands and the public backing of the walk and cycleway proponents. Authorities noted that they were investigating whether any of the protesters would face fines or charges. NZTA representatives noted that they were disappointed at what they considered the broken word of the organisers of the protest, and remarked that it would take 30 more years before walking and cycling could likely be provided (see also &quot;Second Harbour Crossing&quot; below). NZTA were criticised as having brought the situation at least partly onto themselves by choosing the easy route of forbidding the protest crossing. Several political protest marches (especially hīkoi) had been allowed to cross the bridge.

===Updated proposal===
Because of the costs of the proposal and increasing information about the problematic state of the clip-ons, the GetAcross campaign in late 2009 proposed an alternative solution, with a single shared walking and cycling path slung under the eastern clip-on. As confirmed by NZTA, this clip-on has significantly more remaining load capacity (it is used by fewer heavy trucks, being the route of (often empty) trucks returning to Ports of Auckland) and as the proposal would not require widening, the costs have been preliminarily assessed as of the order of NZ$12 million.

The group proposes to raise the majority of the funding via a loan backed by small tolls, of the order of NZ$1 for regular users. NZTA noted that it would be considering the proposal, should funding be able to be secured by the campaigners.

In 2011, the proposal got new public support when Auckland Mayor Len Brown agreed that a walk- and cycleway was a desirable goal, and instructed Auckland Transport to add it to its strategic priorities. The walk- and cycleway is also to be included in the city centre masterplan. Three council-controlled organisations (CCOs) – Auckland Transport, the Waterfront Development Agency and the Tourism, Events and Economic Development Agency – indicated support for the proposal, as has the Heart of the City (Auckland CBD) business association.

In August 2011, an editorial in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; gave conditional support to the newest proposal, noting that a toll-based funding model and the partially enclosed weather-protected design of the $23 million proposal by Hopper Developments would appear to cover most concerns.

===Approval===
In 2014, the proposed walk and cycleway was publicly notified, and consent was given in 2015. However, this was appealed by three local groups (two which later dropped out of the appeal). The decision of the original hearing was upheld in December 2016, and the last appeal rejected by the Environment Court. In the meantime, Council had already provided in principle approval for a public-private partnership funding model, in a unanimous support vote earlier in 2016.

A 2019 announcement said that work on the walking and cycling &quot;clipon&quot; could start in 2020. Mayoral candidate John Tamihere proposed replacement with a 10-lane lower level plus rail and cycling/pedestrian facilities on an upper level.

=== Protests over lack of progress ===
On 30 May 2021, more than 1,500 cyclists crossed the bridge following the Liberate the Lane rally at Point Erin Park organised by Bike Auckland. The rally called for a trial of reallocating a traffic lane for walking and cycling on the bridge over the summer and included speeches by Auckland Central MP Chlöe Swarbrick and former associate minister of transport Julie Anne Genter. The rally was motivated by uncertainty around the future of the SkyPath project. Waka Kotahi had quietly sidelined the project due to technical issues. The Western clip on of the bridge (two motor traffic lanes) had been closed in advance of the rally, with a police cordon blocking access. After Bike Auckland&#x27;s rally concluded, much of the crowd made their way over to the police cordon and pushed past onto the bridge, to show their determination for access for walking and cycling to be provided on the Auckland Harbour Bridge. No injuries were reported however one person was arrested for breaching the cordon, before being released without charge.

In response to the proposal for a trial cycle lane, NZTA stated that a cycle lane would likely require two lanes in order to provide sufficient protection for cyclists and pedestrians.

=== Stand-alone bridge ===
A couple of days after Bike Auckland&#x27;s rally, in June 2021, Transport Minister Michael Wood announced a new stand-alone walking and cycling bridge would be built on the eastern side of the Auckland Harbour Bridge. The bridge was estimated to cost a total of $785 million and had the support of Auckland mayor Phil Goff who said it would benefit both Aucklanders and tourists.

The plan received criticism from cycling, trucking and other transport advocates, as well as from the government opposition parties. In October 2021, Wood announced the project had been scrapped due to lack of public support. He said Waka Kotahi had spent $51 million on designs, consultants and engineering plans for the project up until the end of September, and the final amount spent was not known.

=== Liberate the lane ===
In 2022 Waka Kotahi confirmed it would not provide a trial of walking and cycling on the Auckland Harbour Bridge due to concerns around safety of people using the lane and motor congestion on the bridge.

In July 2023 Bike Auckland released a report by consultant SmartSense Limited, addressing Waka Kotahi&#x27;s key concerns about reallocating a lane on the motor bridge to walking and cycling, including a design solution to mitigate safety concerns. The report revealed that motor traffic volumes have declined, leaving space on the bridge to reallocate one lane for walking, cycling, and wheeling &quot;without significantly affecting motor traffic&quot; Bike Auckland continues to advocate to Waka Kotahi to Liberate the Lane, stating that Waka Kotahi&#x27;s Waitematā connections project will take too long to deliver a walking and cycling connection across the Harbour. Their campaign has attracted the support of a diverse array of organisations, all calling for Waka Kotahi to liberate the lane &quot;now.&quot; Reasons for their support range from giving Aucklanders more affordable and sustainable transport options, to it being a key action for climate action mitigation and emissions reduction.

==Utilities ==
The bridge supports several utility services, including water and gas pipelines and fibre-optic telecommunications cables.

Transpower reached agreement with Transit in 2005 for the installation of cable supports beneath the bridge for a future cross-harbour power cable. In 2012, Transpower installed three 220,000-volt cables on the bridge, linking Hobson Street substation in the Auckland CBD to the Wairau Road substation on the North Shore.

== Tourism ==

=== Bungy jumping and Bridge Climb ===
AJ Hackett operates a bungy jump experience and a guided bridge climb over the arch truss. In popular culture, Bryan Bruce&#x27;s television documentary &quot;The Bridge&quot; (2002) featured footage of the first bungy jump from the Auckland Harbour Bridge.

=== Vector lights ===
Vector Limited, a utility company in New Zealand, uses LED lights with various colours to illuminate the bridge for ornamental reasons. The lights are powered by renewable energy and the installation was completed in November 2017.

==Second Harbour Crossing==

Almost as soon as the bridge was built it reached capacity, before extension via the clip-ons, and a second crossing of the harbour was mooted. The high costs and the difficulties of connecting it to the motorway network have so far caused plans to remain at concept stage. In 2008, a study group narrowed down around 160 options to a multi-tunnel link approximately one km east of the bridge, with up to four individual tunnels for motorway, public transport and rail.

On 6 August 2023, Waka Kotahi announced their Waitematā Harbour Crossings plan which includes a tunnel for light rail and a tunnel for motor traffic, with walking and cycling on two lanes of the existing Harbour Bridge. Construction is expected to start by 2029. Waka Kotahi&#x27;s forecast is that 6,400 people would walk and cycle across the bridge every day.

== Issues and notable incidents ==

=== Resonance ===

The natural sway motion of people walking on the bridge&#x27;s clip-on segment during special events such as the Auckland Marathon can lead the bridge to oscillate sideways. It has been reported that the oscillations can inflict &quot;serious crushing injuries&quot;. The bridge&#x27;s movement is caused by &quot;synchronous lateral excitation&quot;, a positive feedback phenomenon. It has been a known issue since at least 1975, and the lateral frequency is reported to be at 0.67 Hz.

=== Seismic vulnerability and improvements ===
In 1996, NZTA began a seismic screening programme to identify existing bridges that may sustain damage in an earthquake. Following the assessment, the bridge has completed seismic retrofit.

=== Suicides ===

The bridge is associated with suicide attempts. In 2010, a news article reported that one to two individuals die by suicide at the location per year. In 2019, a feasibility study of retrofitting suicide prevention barrier was published. It examined two types of barriers, a vertical anti-climb barrier and horizontal fall prevention barrier. As of 2024, no barriers have been implemented.

=== 2020 structural damage ===
On Friday, 18 September 2020, at approximately 11:00 AM, high winds, with gusts up to , caused a heavy goods vehicle travelling in the central span of the bridge to strike a main diagonal member of the box truss member. The incident reportedly caused severe damage and a significant reduction in daily traffic capacity. Temporary repairs were effected using a locally fabricated replacement member, pending a full engineering analysis and design of the long-term solution. On 4 October, a permanent replacement strut was installed, with all lanes opening again on 7 October 2020. Since the September 2020 incident up until 2024, the bridge has been closed 20 times totalling 435 minutes and costing over $35.6 million in economic damage.

=== Ship strike risks ===
The Baltimore Key Bridge collapse in March 2024 prompted NZ Transport Agency to review Auckland Harbour Bridge safety measures. The review classified the risk of vessel collision with the bridge as &quot;rare,&quot; citing multiple existing safety measures. The review also stated that Chelsea sugar ship is the only cargo ship that regularly passes under the bridge.

The first Finnish settler in the area was Paavali Pelkonen from Lumijoki, who came to the area, then called &quot;Kilpimaa&quot;, in the 1670s. The area was still property of the Sompio siida. Later it was a part of the Sodankylä parish, under which it acquired its first chapel in 1857. The community was called &quot;Alaperä&quot; at that time. Pelkosenniemi became a separate parish in 1916, as did Savukoski.

<doc id="662952" wikidata="Q31331" url="?curid=662952" title="Pello">
<text>Pello (formerly Turtola) is a municipality of Finland. It is located approximately north of the Arctic Circle in the western part of the province of Lapland, and is part of the Lapland region. The municipality is on the national border with Sweden, by the Tornionjoki-river. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of
which 
is water. The population density is

The municipality is unilingually Finnish, according to the legal definition in Finland.

Konttajärvi is in this municipality.

It is served by the Pello railway station.

== History ==
The name of Pello is ultimately derived from the word &quot;pelto&quot;, field; which may have been the original name of the village. The weak grade stem of &quot;pelto&quot; is &quot;pello-&quot; (e.g. &quot;pellon&quot; - genitive case form of &quot;pelto&quot;), through which the name was corrupted to its current form. The name of Turtola refers to a male name &quot;Turto&quot;, a Finnish form of the Scandinavian name &quot;Tord&quot;.

During the Late Middle Ages and the 16th century, Pello was the northernmost Finnish village in the Tornio Valley. It was a part of the Tornio parish until 1606, when said parish was divided into Alatornio and Ylitornio, from which the latter included Turtola and Pello. 

After Russia conquered Finland in 1809, Ylitornio was split into two parts. The villages of Pello and Turtola were also split, which is why there is a Pello and a Turtola (Svanstein) in Sweden. The northern parts of Ylitornio became a separate parish and municipality in 1867, called Turtola after its most significant village at the time. The village of Pello later surpassed Turtola, thus the municipality was renamed to Pello in 1949.

<text>LaMont Johnson (October 1, 1941 – October 21, 1999) was an American jazz pianist who played in the hard bop and post-bop genres. He recorded extensively with Jackie McLean during the 1960s as well as with Ornette Coleman, Kenny Burrell, Bud Shank, Paul Beaver, and Bernie Krause, among others.

==Biography==
James LaMont Johnson was born in New York City, New York. During his childhood he took dancing, singing, and mime lessons, and appeared on the &quot;Star Time Kids&quot; television program at age 7. He later served in the United States Air Force in Germany, after which he attended Manhattan College and Syracuse University.

Johnson began his recording career in 1962. In New York City, he worked with tubist Howard Johnson and trumpeter Woody Shaw as the bebop period came to an end. Throughout the 1960s, he recorded with artists such as Jackie McLean, Ornette Coleman, and George Benson. Later in the same decade, Johnson began composing music for films and advertisements.

Johnson lived and worked in San Diego, California, where he established the record label MasterScores Records. Johnson worked in the film industry during the 1970s as a distributor and producer. He produced the 1973 martial arts film &quot;Thunderfist&quot;. Johnson was a major shareholder in the film distributors Artisan Releasing and Twin World Films, and formed another distributorship, Elmark General Film.

In his later years, Johnson lived in Austin, Texas, where he continued to perform at venues such as Top of the Marc, and released &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Kwanzaa&quot; on the Bagel Label. During this time, he appeared on &quot;Jackie&#x27;s Blues Bag&quot; by the Hip Bop Essence All Stars, a group that also included Branford Marsalis, Javon Jackson, and Vincent Herring. He also worked with Black Entertainment Television. Between 1991 and 1997, he was involved with more than 30 jazz festivals, as either a performer or producer.

On October 21, 1999, Johnson died of heart failure in Austin, Texas, where he lived with his wife, Jayne Taylor Johnson. Johnson had two daughters, Astrid and Kyleigh, and two sons, Neil and Rand. At the time of his death, Johnson had indicated his plans to return to San Diego.

== History ==

Ranua was originally the name of a farm established in the 18th century. It gets its name from the lake Ranuanjärvi, which was first mentioned in 1553. Its name is likely of Tavastian origin, as &quot;ranu-&quot; toponyms are rare and mainly found in Tavastia.

The parish of Ranua was formed from parts of Simo, Pudasjärvi and Rovaniemen maalaiskunta in 1899. The area became a separate municipality in 1917. A part of it was given to the newly formed Posio municipality in 1926. It is the only municipality in Lapland where the dialect is a Northern Ostrobothnian one, albeit with some influence from the Kainuu dialects, which are a subset of Savonian dialects.

<doc id="662974" wikidata="Q83714" url="?curid=662974" title="Pete La Roca">
<text>Pete &quot;La Roca&quot; Sims (born Peter Sims; April 7, 1938 – November 20, 2012, known as Pete La Roca from 1957 until 1968) was an American jazz drummer and attorney. Born and raised in Harlem by a pianist mother and a stepfather who played trumpet, he was introduced to jazz by his uncle Kenneth Bright, a major shareholder in Circle Records and the manager of rehearsal spaces above the Lafayette Theater. Sims studied percussion at the High School of Music and Art and at the City College of New York, where he played tympani in the CCNY Orchestra. He adopted the name La Roca early in his musical career, when he played timbales for six years in Latin bands. In the 1970s, during a hiatus from jazz performance, he resumed using his original surname. When he returned to jazz in the late 1970s, he usually inserted &quot;La Roca&quot; into his name in quotation marks to help audiences familiar with his early work identify him. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1982 that he did so only out of necessity:
In 1957, Max Roach became aware of him while jamming at Birdland and recommended him to Sonny Rollins. As drummer of Rollins&#x27; trio on the afternoon set at the Village Vanguard on November 3 he became part of the important record &quot;A Night at the Village Vanguard.&quot; (Only one of five recorded tracks with La Roca was included on the original single LP release of the album). In 1959 he recorded with Jackie McLean (&quot;New Soil&quot;) and in a quartet with Tony Scott, Bill Evans and Jimmy Garrison. Besides Garrison he often joined with bassists who played in the Bill Evans Trio, especially Scott LaFaro and Steve Swallow, and also accompanied pianists like Steve Kuhn, Don Friedman and Paul Bley.

Between the end of the 1950s and 1968, he also played with Slide Hampton, the John Coltrane Quartet, Marian McPartland, Art Farmer, Freddie Hubbard, Mose Allison, and Charles Lloyd, among others. During this period, he led his own group and worked as the house drummer at the Jazz Workshop in Boston, Massachusetts. He recorded two albums as a leader during the mid-1960s, &quot;Basra&quot; (Blue Note, 1965) and &quot;Turkish Women at the Bath&quot; (Douglas, 1967).

In 1968, with the market for acoustic jazz in decline, Sims decided to enroll in law school. By this time he was already earning most of his income by driving a taxi cab in New York City, a job he held for five years during the 1960s. Sims became a lawyer in the early 1970s, and was still practicing at the time of a 1997 radio interview with WNYC&#x27;s Steve Sullivan. When his album &quot;Turkish Women at the Bath&quot; was re-released on Muse Records as &quot;Bliss&quot; in 1973 under Chick Corea&#x27;s name (without Sims&#x27; consent), Sims filed a lawsuit and served as his own legal counsel. Sims won his suit, and the erroneously-labeled records were recalled.

He returned to jazz part-time in 1979, and recorded one new album as a leader, &quot;Swing Time&quot; (Blue Note, 1997).

Sims died in 2012 in New York of lung cancer, at the age of 74.

<text>The Cat Empire is the debut studio album of Australian alternative rock band the Cat Empire, which was released on 24 October 2003. It peaked at No. 15 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified 2× platinum by ARIA in 2005. Four singles were issued from the album, &quot;Hello&quot; (October 2003), &quot;Days Like These&quot; (February 2004), &quot;The Chariot&quot; (May 2004) and &quot;One, Four, Five&quot; (2004). At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, the band received six nominations including Best Group, Best Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Urban Release for &quot;The Cat Empire&quot;; Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year for Baldwin&#x27;s work on the album.

==Recording of the album==

The Cat Empire recorded their eponymous debut studio album sporadically over seven months during 2003 with Andy Baldwin, co-producing, at studios in Melbourne and at Byron Bay. They recorded material in-between touring Australia, playing at the St Kilda Festival with Kate Ceberano (February 2003) and appearing at the Byron Bay Blues &amp; Roots Festival (April). The band were nominated in two categories at the Australian Jazz Awards. The band successfully applied for an International Pathways grant from the Australia Council for the Arts.

The band were featured in BBC Four coverage of the 2003 WOMAD Festival. Their track &quot;Two Shoes&quot; was placed on high rotation on BBC Radio 1 in August 2003. The band&#x27;s growing live and critical reputation put them in a great position to approach record companies for a record deal for their self-financed, self-titled debut album in the middle of 2003. The band signed a deal with EMI&#x27;s Virgin Records subsidiary.

==Charting and live success==

The first single from &quot;The Cat Empire&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, was released in October 2003, its music video was Channel V&#x27;s clip of the week ahead of one by Justin Timberlake. The single peaked at No. 12 on the New Zealand Singles Chart during January 2004. The album was issued on 24 October 2003, which peaked at No. 15 on the ARIA Albums Chart. National radio station, Triple J nominated it as their album of the week in November. The group appeared on Australian TV shows, &quot;Rove (Live)&quot; with Rove McManus and &quot;The Panel&quot; on Network Ten, which helped raise the album&#x27;s profile. It was certified gold in Australia by ARIA by December 2003.

&quot;Days Like These&quot; was issued as the second single in February 2004, reaching the top 40 of the ARIA Singles Chart. Their debut album received platinum accreditation in that year, and was certified 2× platinum in the following year for shipment of 140,000 units. Their third single &quot;The Chariot&quot; debuted in the ARIA top 40 in May 2004.

&quot;Hello&quot; was listed at No. 6 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003, one of the biggest music polls in the world, with other singles, &quot;Days Like These&quot; at No. 37 and &quot;The Chariot&quot; at No. 100.

This album was released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. Its fourth single, &quot;One, Four, Five&quot;, appeared late in 2004. It was reviewed in March 2012 by &quot;The British Medical Journal&quot;″s Ray Moynihan who felt the &quot;little known gem&quot; with its title giving &quot;a simple reference to a common progression of chords, but, more deeply, it&#x27;s a call to celebrate the power of music&quot; had &quot;lyrical musings seem whimsical, but they resonate through a small though growing evidence base.&quot;

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, the band received six nominations for Best Group, Best Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Urban Release for &quot;The Cat Empire&quot;; Engineer of the Year for Andy Baldwin&#x27;s work on the album, Producer of the Year for Baldwin and the group, and Best Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Days Like These&quot; from this album.

== Track listing ==

== Releases ==

A different version of &quot;The Cat Empire&quot; was released in some European countries under the Universal Music Group. It adds the rare track, &quot;Feline&quot; (found on their live album, &quot;Touring Europe and the UK, 2004&quot;), as track 7, thereby renumbering the later tracks. &quot;The Chariot&quot; and &quot;Beanni&quot; trade places.

A promotional advance release of the album also exists (labelled &#x27;PR337&#x27;, pressed by Virgin Records), called &quot;Oct 2003 Album&quot; and was sent to reviewers before the album was released. It contains the same track listing as the European version. Another advance release exists, again, pressed by Virgin Records, and labelled &#x27;PR343&#x27;, which has the same track listing as the &#x27;PR337&#x27; release, albeit with correct spelling of track 3 on the disc.

The tracks in the promotional release are all earlier, more &#x27;raw&#x27; mixes and have subtle differences, yet they contribute greatly to the depth of each track. A few examples include extra background percussion throughout &quot;How to Explain?&quot;, and different voice samples in &quot;Days Like These&quot; (for example, the &quot;one two&quot; sample, and Hull-Brown&#x27;s Mexican voice).

<doc id="662990" wikidata="Q338574" url="?curid=662990" title="Cellular Message Encryption Algorithm">
<text>In cryptography, the Cellular Message Encryption Algorithm (CMEA) is a block cipher which was used for securing mobile phones in the United States. CMEA is one of four cryptographic primitives specified in a Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) standard, and is designed to encrypt the control channel, rather than the voice data. In 1997, a group of cryptographers published attacks on the cipher showing it had several weaknesses which give it a trivial effective strength of a 24-bit to 32-bit cipher.
Some accusations were made that the NSA had pressured the original designers into crippling CMEA, but the NSA has denied any role in the design or selection of the algorithm. The ECMEA and SCEMA ciphers are derived from CMEA.

CMEA is described in . It is byte-oriented, with variable block size, typically 2 to 6 bytes. The key size is only 64 bits. Both of these are unusually small for a modern cipher. The algorithm consists of only 3 passes over the data: a non-linear left-to-right diffusion operation, an unkeyed linear mixing, and another non-linear diffusion that is in fact the inverse of the first. The non-linear operations use a keyed lookup table called the &quot;T-box&quot;, which uses an unkeyed lookup table called the &quot;CaveTable&quot;. The algorithm is self-inverse; re-encrypting the ciphertext with the same key is equivalent to decrypting it.

CMEA is severely insecure. There is a chosen-plaintext attack, effective for all block sizes, using 338 chosen plaintexts. For 3-byte blocks (typically used to encrypt each dialled digit), there is a known-plaintext attack using 40 to 80 known plaintexts. For 2-byte blocks, 4 known plaintexts suffice.

The &quot;improved&quot; CMEA, CMEA-I, is not much better: chosen-plaintext attack of it requires less than 850 plaintexts in its adaptive version.

<text>In computational complexity theory, a speedup theorem is a theorem that for any algorithm (of a certain class) demonstrates the existence of a more efficient algorithm solving the same problem. 

Examples:
*Linear speedup theorem, that the space and time requirements of a Turing machine solving a decision problem can be reduced by a multiplicative constant factor.
*Blum&#x27;s speedup theorem, which provides speedup by any computable function (not just linear, as in the previous theorem).

<text>Stefan Kudelski (27 August 1931 – 26 January 2013) was a Polish audio engineer known for creating the Nagra series of professional audio recorders.

==Life and career==
Stefan Kudelski was born in Warsaw into a family with engineering background. In September 1939 the family fled Poland during the Nazi German and Soviet Invasion of Poland. They escaped to Romania, then moved to Hungary, and on to France. When the Germans occupied southern Vichy France, the family escaped to Switzerland in 1943. He studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne and constructed his first tape recorder there, as a student project. The recorder was supposed to drive a machine tool, but was good enough to record audio as well.

*1951 – Kudelski built his first Nagra tape recorder
*1957 – The Nagra III, a transistorized tape recorder with electronic speed control, is launched

Kudelski received many awards during his career:

* Academy Awards: Scientific or Technical Award (1965, 1977 and 1978) 
* Gordon E. Sawyer Award (1990)
* Emmy Awards (1984 and 1986) 
* Gold Medals from L. Warner, AES (1984), Lyra and Eurotechnica. 

Stefan Kudelski retired in 1991, and was succeeded by his son, André, as a Chairman and CEO of the Kudelski Group.

He died on 26 January 2013 in Lausanne, Switzerland.

<doc id="663000" wikidata="Q5101638" url="?curid=663000" title="Chipped beef">
<text>Chipped beef is a form of pressed, salted and dried beef that has been sliced into thin pieces. Some makers smoke the dried beef for more flavor. The modern product consists of small, thin, flexible leaves of partially dried beef, generally sold compressed together in jars or flat in plastic packets. The processed meat producer Hormel once described it as &quot;an air-dried product that is similar to bresaola, but not as tasty.&quot;

==Uses==

Chipped beef could be used to make frizzled beef (creamed chipped beef or SOS in military slang), or with eggs.

==Availability==

Chipped beef is served in many diners and restaurants in the United States as a breakfast item. It is popular among the veteran community who generally refer to it by the dysphemism &quot;Shit On a Shingle&quot; or &quot;S.O.S.&quot; (when polite company and/or children are present, the acronym is said to mean &quot;Same Old Stuff.&quot;). Chipped beef in milk gravy is a common traditional meal served in all branches of the United States Armed Forces due to its reasonable nutritional profile, ease and speed of preparing, and relatively low cost to produce in large quantities (i.e., in quantities sufficient to properly feed an entire military outpost). Creamed chipped beef is also a standard fare on many diner menus, especially in the Mid-Atlantic, but has become harder to find in chain restaurants that serve breakfast. Among the restaurants still offering chipped beef on toast are Golden Corral and Silver Diner. IHOP no longer offers this on their menus, having substituted sausage gravy, and the same is true for Cracker Barrel restaurants.
It is also available from companies such as Stouffer&#x27;s in a frozen form which can be put on top of separately-prepared toast; it is typically quite salty. For instance, Stouffer&#x27;s creamed chipped beef contains 540 mg sodium per 140 kcal serving, down only slightly from 590 mg per 140 kcal serving in 2010. The mixture was also, at one point, available from both Freezer Queen and Banquet as &quot;hot sandwich toppers&quot;; as of late 2007, Freezer Queen no longer makes this product, and the Banquet variety is rarely found. Finally, both the Esskay Meat Company of Baltimore and Knauss Foods make a refrigerated version of creamed chipped beef which can be easily microwaved. The meat itself is also available for purchase under the Knauss and Carson&#x27;s Brand names. Steak-umm is used as a substitute.

==Chipped beef on toast==

Chipped beef on toast (or creamed chipped beef on toast) is a dish comprising a white sauce and rehydrated slivers of dried beef, served on toasted bread. Hormel recommends flavoring the dish with Worcestershire sauce. Chipped beef is also often served on bagels, English muffins, biscuits, home fries, rice, mashed potato and in casserole.

===U.S. military cuisine===
In the United States, chipped beef on toast was commonly served to service members of the United States Armed Forces from World War I through Vietnam. It was considered emblematic of the military experience and consequently also served to Boy Scouts of the era. In American military slang it is commonly referred to by the dysphemism &quot;Shit on a Shingle&quot; (SOS).

According to &quot;We Are The Mighty&quot;, the dish first appears in the &quot;1910 Manual for Army Cooks&quot;, where a recipe for feeding 60 men can be found as below:

Wentworth and Flexner cite no origin for the term, but noted &quot;shingle&quot; for slice of toast has had &quot;some use since 1935&quot; in the U.S. Army, mostly in the expression &quot;shit on a shingle&quot;, and the latter had &quot;wide World War II Army use&quot;.

In his World War II book &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, Stephen E. Ambrose evokes the military basics:

<text>Union Township is a now dissolved township which existed from 1831 to 1868 and was located in present-day Camden County, New Jersey.

Union Township was formed by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 15, 1831, while the area was still part of Gloucester County, taking territory from Gloucester Township and incorporating all of Gloucestertown Township.

When Camden County was separated from Gloucester County on March 13, 1844, Union Township was one of the original Camden County municipalities. On March 6, 1855, a new township, Centre Township, was formed from Union Township&#x27;s territory. On February 25, 1868, the township was dissolved and the remaining land was chartered as Gloucester City.

==Current municipalities within the bounds of Union Township==

<doc id="663004" wikidata="Q4909600" url="?curid=663004" title="Bill Jemas">
<text>Bill Jemas () is an American media entrepreneur, writer, and editor, known for his tenure as president of Fleer Entertainment Group during the 1990s, and for his work as vice president of Marvel Comics from 2000 to 2004. During his time at Marvel, Jemas and editor-in-chief Joe Quesada implemented Marvel&#x27;s no-overship policy, newsstand compilation magazines, added the Marvel MAX line, fortified the Marvel Knights imprint, removed the Comics Code from Marvel books, increased Marvel&#x27;s publication of trade paperbacks, and were credited with shepherding the company from bankruptcy to profit, earning positive reviews from within and outside of the comics industry. However, Jemas also was criticized for micromanagement and provocative public statements that made him a controversial figure.

==Early life==
Jemas was raised in a Roman Catholic household. In 1980, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Rutgers University, where he majored in history and minored in philosophy and economics. In 1983 he graduated from Harvard Law School with a Juris Doctor.

==Career==
After graduating Harvard, Jemas took a job as a tax attorney at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett in New York. Disappointed by this work, he left after two years to work for the National Basketball Association, which he found to be more entrepreneurial, and allowed him to focus on managing a business and working on deals, which Jemas sees as two of the things he does best. It also gave him entry into the entertainment field, which he felt would open up lucrative opportunities. While at NBA, according to Jemas, he helped build an almost non-existent basketball card business into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.

Jemas became president of Fleer Entertainment Group and Fleer Corp in 1993, and appointed Jemas as executive vice president of Marvel Entertainment Group that year. In January 2000, he became president of consumer products, publishing and new media—essentially Marvel Comics&#x27; publisher. During his tenure, his tendencies toward micromanagement and provocative public statements made him a controversial figure.

He came to prominence at Marvel Comics (which owned Fleer), during the former&#x27;s bankruptcy reorganizations. During his tenure, Jemas was key in replacing editor-in-chief Bob Harras with Joe Quesada. Jemas and Quesada formed the public face of Marvel, taking the roles of, said one observer, of &quot;good cop and bad cop&quot;. Among the policies they implemented were Marvel&#x27;s no-overship policy, newsstand compilation magazines, adding the Marvel MAX line, entrenching Marvel Knights, and removal of the Comics Code from Marvel books. They also increased Marvel&#x27;s publication of trade paperbacks, and are credited with shepherding the company from bankruptcy to profit, and with earning positive reviews from within and outside of the comics industry.

Other later initiatives include titles such as &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;The Call&quot; and &quot;Marville&quot;, the last of which was Jemas&#x27;s entry in the U-Decide competition with Quesada and Peter David.

Jemas and Quesada&#x27;s partnership would eventually suffer amid controversy generated by Jemas, which Marvel executives frowned upon, and which resulted in Quesada distancing himself from Jemas in the eyes of Marvel staff and freelancers. During this time, Jemas spearheaded the revival of the company&#x27;s Epic line, which would publish creator-owned books, but his interference in editorial generated much ill will among creators who felt his ideas did not help the quality of the books. Producer and Marvel Studios CEO Avi Arad in particular was angered over certain comics overseen by Jemas that Arad had difficulty selling to Hollywood producers and stars. As the company&#x27;s film properties grew in importance, Jemas lost the loyalty of Arad&#x27;s business partner, Isaac Perlmutter, who had been instrumental in bringing Marvel out of bankruptcy through the merger of his company, Toy Biz.

Upon his departure from the company, Jemas continued to work with Marvel in a non-executive capacity through mid-2004, writing or co-writing Marvel comic books including &quot;Namor&quot; and &quot;Origin&quot;.

Comic book writer Gail Simone said on her blog that she ghost wrote for Jemas during his tenure at Marvel. She later clarified that she was referring to a comedic article about Marvel giving away free cookies rather than an actual comic.

Upon his departure from Marvel Entertainment, Jemas started 360ep, an entertainment property management firm. He developed the Freeware Bible, which translates ancient Aramaic-Hebrew words into English synonyms, for the purpose of providing an English translation of Genesis that is truer to the original Hebrew text than commonly used translations like the King James Bible, and to &quot;show readers that widely accepted Bible translations are inherently imperfect&quot;. By February 2009, he had completed the first chapter. Jemas also managed a T-shirt line, IDtees, whose T-shirts contained positive messages. The line was eventually discontinued so that Jemas could focus on other projects.

In 2012, Jemas announced the creation of an online comics venture, the Transverse Universe. A new print comic, &quot;Wake the F#CK Up&quot;, was released December 4, 2012 via Zenescope Comics. The promotion of the comic was spearheaded with a YouTube video by hip-hop artist Kilgorian Tralfamadore.

In December 2013, Jemas joined Take-Two Interactive to start a graphic fiction imprint, Double Take Comics. Double Take Comics closed in November 2016.

In 2019, Jemas joined the new comic book publisher Artists, Writers and Artisans,
or AWA Studios an initiative created by former Marvel editor-in-chief Axel Alonso, on which Jemas would serve as chief creative officer. The publisher announced that its first slate of titles would include books by creators such as Peter Milligan, Frank Cho, and Christa Faust. One of its early publications was &quot;The Resistance&quot;, a miniseries by J. Michael Straczynski and Mike Deodato, which depicts a global pandemic caused by a pathogen that kills 95 percent of those infected, leaving the remaining five percent with superhuman abilities. The series, which was intended to establish a new superhero universe, debuted on March 18, 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic was taking hold in the United States. The series garnered positive reviews, achieved a rating of 8.9 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, based on 24 reviews.

== Personal life ==
Jemas&#x27;s wife is Jewish. They both attend the Reconstructionist synagogue in Princeton.
