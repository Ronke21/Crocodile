<text>Joseph Lyle Menendez (born January 10, 1968) and Erik Galen Menendez (born November 27, 1970), commonly referred to as the Menendez brothers, are American brothers convicted of killing their parents, José and Mary Louise &quot;Kitty&quot; Menendez, at their Beverly Hills home in 1989.

Following the murders, Lyle and Erik claimed that unknown intruders were responsible for the murders, framing it as a potential mob killing. Police initially investigated this claim, but grew suspicious due to the brothers&#x27; spending and their hiring of a computer expert to delete their father&#x27;s recently updated will. Erik confessed to the murders in sessions with his psychologist, citing a desire to be free of a controlling father with high standards, which led to their arrests months later.

Lyle and Erik were charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for lying in wait, making them eligible for the death penalty, and charges of conspiracy to murder. During their first trial, the defense argued that the brothers killed their parents in self-defense after years of alleged sexual, emotional, and physical abuse. The prosecution argued that the murders were premeditated, that allegations of sexual abuse were fabricated, and that the brothers were motivated by hatred and a desire to receive their father&#x27;s multimillion-dollar estate after being disinherited from his will. The juries were unable to reach a verdict, resulting in mistrials for both brothers. In a second trial, they were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

Lyle and Erik currently serve life sentences at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility near San Diego, California. Multiple legal appeals of their convictions have been rejected by reviewing judges. In October 2024, Los Angeles district attorney George Gascón recommended a resentencing after reviewing a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition.

The highly publicized trials received international media attention, inspiring numerous documentaries, dramatizations, books, and parodies. 

==Background==
José Enrique Menendez was born on May 6, 1944, in Havana, Cuba. At age 16, due to the Cuban Revolution, he moved to the United States. José attended Southern Illinois University, where he met Mary Louise &quot;Kitty&quot; Andersen (1941–1989). They were married in 1963 and moved to New York City where José earned an accounting degree from Queens College.

The couple&#x27;s first son, Joseph Lyle, who goes by his middle name, was born on January10, 1968, in New York. Kitty quit her teaching job after Lyle was born, and the family moved to New Jersey, where Erik Galen was born on November27, 1970, in Gloucester Township. The family lived in Hopewell Township and both brothers attended Princeton Day School.

José became an executive at Hertz Corporation and later RCA Records. After he was appointed as the CEO of Live Entertainment, the family moved to Calabasas, California, where Erik attended Calabasas High School.

In 1988, Lyle and Erik committed multiple burglaries in their neighborhood, stealing more than $100,000 in cash and jewelry, prompting José to move to Beverly Hills. The following year, Erik attended Beverly Hills High School where he earned average grades but displayed a talent for tennis, ranking 44th in the US as a junior. About two weeks before the murders, Erik and his friend Michael Joyce entered the 1989 Boys&#x27; Junior National Tennis Championship.

Lyle attended Princeton University, where he was placed on academic probation for poor grades and eventually suspended for plagiarism. He lived in the Gauss Hall dormitory, where he threw out his roommates&#x27; belongings as he did not wish to share a room, left sinks overflowing causing damage, and repainted his room in violation of university rules.

In high school, Erik co-wrote an amateur screenplay titled &quot;Friends&quot; with his classmate, telling the story of a wealthy young man who committed the &quot;perfect murder&quot; by killing his parents for their inheritance.

==Murders and investigation==

=== Murders and alibi ===
On August 18, 1989, Lyle and Erik went to several gun stores in Southern California to buy handguns. However, due to issues with Lyle&#x27;s California driver&#x27;s license and a two-week waiting period mandated by gun laws, the brothers decided to purchase shotguns instead. They acquired Mossberg 12-gauge shotguns along with boxes of birdshot and buckshot ammunition in a Big 5 Sporting Goods store in San Diego, California, where Erik used a stolen driver&#x27;s license from Lyle&#x27;s friend, Donovan Goodreau.

On the evening of August 20, 1989, José and Kitty were watching &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; in the theatre den of their Beverly Hills mansion when Lyle and Erik entered the den, carrying loaded shotguns. José was shot six times, including a fatal shot to the back of his head. Kitty was shot ten times in total. Before the fatal shot to her cheek, she was on the ground, crawling away. Lyle ran to the car where Erik handed him ammunition to reload before firing the fatal shot to her face.

Immediately after the killings, both brothers remained in the house for a few minutes, expecting the police to respond due to the noise of the gunshots. They left to dispose of their clothes that were stained with blood, and later buried the shotguns somewhere along Mulholland Drive. They also went to a movie theater and attempted to purchase tickets for the film &quot;Batman&quot; to use as their alibi but abandoned the plan due to the timestamp on the ticket stub. They then headed to the &quot;Taste of L.A.&quot; festival at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.

After returning home and finding no police presence, Lyle called 911 and emotionally told the operator, &quot;someone killed my parents&quot;, saying that he had just come home and discovered their bodies. Erik was heard screaming and crying in the background. When the officers arrived, Lyle and Erik ran from the home toward the officers while screaming. When the police arrived, they did not seek gunshot residue tests from the brothers, which would have indicated whether they had recently discharged a firearm. Lyle and Erik both falsely told officers that they were elsewhere at the time of the killings. Lyle told officers he thought the killings might be &quot;business-related&quot;, implying a Mafia hit.

Police officers and forensic staff who worked on the crime scene described it as &quot;the most brutal&quot; one they had ever encountered, noting the blood and brain matter splattered throughout the room. Retired police detective Dan Stewart stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of homicides, but nothing quite that brutal. Blood, flesh, skulls. It would be hard to describe, especially José, as resembling a human that you would recognize. That&#x27;s how bad it was.&quot; According to the autopsy report, one blast caused &quot;explosive decapitation with evisceration of the brain&quot; and &quot;deformity of the face&quot; to José, while the first round of shots struck Kitty in her chest, right arm, left hip, and left leg, with the contact shot causing &quot;multiple lacerations of the brain&quot;.
=== Investigation and arrests ===
Detectives initially investigated Lyle&#x27;s suggestion that the murders were a result of mob-related activity due to its heinousness and José&#x27;s business connections.

In the months after the killings, the brothers spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on luxury items, businesses, and travel. Lyle bought Chuck&#x27;s Spring Street Café, a Buffalo wing restaurant in Princeton, New Jersey, as well as three Rolex watches and a Porsche Carrera sports car. Erik hired a full-time tennis coach and competed in a series of tournaments overseas. The brothers eventually left the Beverly Hills mansion unoccupied, choosing to live in adjoining condominiums in nearby Marina del Rey. They also dined at high-end restaurants and took overseas trips to the Caribbean and London. Their courtside attendance at a New York Knicks basketball game was captured in the background of a Mark Jackson trading card. During this time, they spent approximately $700,000. Most of this money came from a $650,000 personal life insurance policy, which was paid out, although a larger insurance policy for $15 million with LIVE Entertainment as beneficiaries, not the Menendez brothers, turned out to be invalid. This spending caused police to begin to consider the brothers as suspects, with a possible financial motive. Family members disputed a connection between their spending and the murder of their parents, asserting that there were no changes in their spending habits after the killings.

Erik&#x27;s high school friend, Craig Cignarelli, reported to the police that Erik had confessed to him. He also revealed that he and Erik had previously written a 66-page screenplay titled &quot;Friends&quot;, which depicted a son killing his wealthy parents for their inheritance. In an attempt to get a confession, police arranged for Cignarelli to wear a wire during a lunch with Erik. When Cignarelli asked Erik whether he had killed his parents, Erik denied it.

Police also heard from Lyle&#x27;s friend Glenn Stevens that one week after the killings, Lyle had made a sudden trip back home from Princeton to destroy something in the family computer. Stevens said that Lyle told him a family member &quot;found a new will and I went there and erased it&quot;. A computer expert hired by Lyle, also said he was hired to ensure deletion of a new will José had prepared, that may have left less to his sons.

Erik eventually confessed to his psychologist, Jerome Oziel, who then told his mistress, Judalon Smyth. Oziel began recording his sessions with Lyle and Erik. After breaking up with Oziel, Smyth informed the police about the brothers&#x27; involvement in the murders. Lyle was arrested on March8, 1990, outside their Beverly Hills home, while Erik turned himself in three days later after returning to Los Angeles from Israel. Both were held without bail and jailed separately at the Los Angeles County Jail.

==Trials==

=== Pretrial detention and legal disputes ===
In August 1990, Judge James Albracht ruled that tapes of the conversations between Erik and his psychologist Jerome Oziel were admissible evidence since Oziel claimed that Lyle threatened him and violated doctor–patient privilege. Albracht&#x27;s ruling was appealed, after which the proceedings were delayed for two years. The Supreme Court of California ruled in August 1992 that most of the tapes were admissible, with the exception of the tape on which Erik discussed the murders.

After that decision, a Los Angeles County grand jury issued indictments in December 1992, charging the brothers with the murders of their parents; the special circumstances that the killings were committed for financial gain was deemed unsupported by evidence and was subsequently excluded from the charges. They were charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for lying in wait, which made them eligible for the death penalty.

=== First trial (1993–1994) ===
Represented by lead defense lawyers, Leslie Abramson (for Erik) and Jill Lansing (for Lyle), the brothers stated that they killed their parents out of fear for their lives after a lifetime of abuse at the hands of their parents, especially sexual abuse at the hands of their father, who was described as a cruel perfectionist and pedophile. Meanwhile, their mother was described as an enabling, selfish, mentally unstable alcoholic and drug addict who encouraged her husband&#x27;s behavior and was also violent toward the brothers. Lyle alleged that his father began abusing him at age 6, but stopped when he was 8 without explanation. Erik alleged he was abused up until adulthood, shortly prior to the murders. Erik testified that two weeks before the killings, he first told Lyle about the sexual abuse he was experiencing, leading to multiple confrontations within the family. Both brothers testified that their father had threatened to kill them if they did not keep the abuse secret. As a result, they purchased shotguns for &quot;protection and self-defense&quot;. They alleged that the final confrontation occurred in their home&#x27;s den on August 20, 1989, shortly before Kitty and José were killed. According to their testimony, José closed the den&#x27;s door, which they described as &quot;unusual&quot;. They testified that they were afraid that they would be killed by their parents, so went outside to load their shotguns, and Erik recalled, &quot;As I went into the room, I just started firing.&quot;

Under California law, the brothers could only be acquitted for manslaughter if they could prove they were in immediate or imminent danger. The prosecution argued there was no evidence of imminent danger or self defense. Prosecutor Pam Bozanich argued this was contradicted by the brothers purchasing shotguns in advance. Prosecutors used the taped conversation between the brothers and their psychologist, in which the brothers said they had planned the murders &quot;beforehand&quot;. Prosecution argued the murders were inconsistent with a self defense killing; after they had shot their mother Kitty who was &quot;moaning and trying to crawl away&quot;, Lyle went to reload his shotgun and returned to finish her off.

The prosecution argued that the sexual abuse allegations were fabricated; as nobody mentioned abuse until seven months after the murders while a legal defense was being formulated. The prosecution told jurors that mention of sexual abuse was absent in discussions and tapes with their psychologist, Jerome Oziel, and that Erik did not mention abuse in his earlier confession to his friend Craig Cignarelli. The prosecution told jurors throughout the trial that Lyle and Erik were capable of lying frequently and in great detail to avoid being caught, and thus they were also capable of lying about child abuse to avoid death sentences. Prosecutor Pam Bozanich played Lyle&#x27;s staged 911 call for the jurors with the intention of showing how good an actor he was.

Prior to the trial, Lyle offered his ex-girlfriend Jamie Pisarcik money if she would lie for him in the trial and claim that José Menendez had made sexual advances towards her; which Pisarcik reported to the police. Before Lyle was cross-examined by the prosecution, he pre-emptively admitted this under questioning by his own lawyer.

Lyle and Erik&#x27;s cousin, Diane Vander Molen, testified that during a stay with the family in the mid-1970s, Lyle confided in her that his father was sexually abusing him. Vander Molen claimed she told Kitty about the incident, but Kitty sided with her husband, accusing Lyle of lying. Vander Molen recalled that after this, Kitty sent Lyle upstairs, and she never heard of the issue again. Under questioning from Pam Bozanich, Vander Molen said she had never witnessed any abuse. Lyle testified that Vander Molen was the only person he ever told of the abuse. Another cousin, Andy Cano, alleged that as a child, Erik told him about the abuse, which they both described as genital &quot;massages&quot;. Prosecutors pressed Cano, asking him if he would lie for his cousin, which he denied.

The defense presented two faceless photographs of baby boys from the waist down, which Lyle alleged were taken by their father when they were little. The prosecution argued that there was no evidence the photographs were taken by José, and the photos were found on a roll of film interspersed with photos from a children&#x27;s birthday party.

Evidence from a taped therapy session between the brothers and their psychologist, Jerome Oziel, was also presented in court, after legal attempts by the defense to exclude it. The prosecution used the tapes to disprove the abuse claims, as the brothers made no mention of sexual abuse, and instead complained about their dictatorial father and suicidal mother. Lyle also stated that by killing their mother, they may be &quot;doing her and [he and Erik] a favor... putting her out of her misery&quot; and that they had &quot;shown great courage by killing their mother&quot;. According to Oziel&#x27;s account, &quot;They didn&#x27;t kill their parents for money but rather out of hatred and out of a desire to be free from their father&#x27;s domination, messages of inadequacy, and impossible standards.&quot; Oziel said that Lyle had confided that &quot;he knew his father would have been proud of him for killing him&quot; for pulling off the task.

The defense consultant Ann Burgess argued Oziel was &quot;manipulative&quot; and &quot;controlling&quot;, arguing he directed many of the statements made by the brothers in the tape recordings. Oziel&#x27;s ex-mistress, Judalon Smyth, also testified that Oziel wanted to &quot;control&quot; the brothers by taping their sessions. Smyth&#x27;s testimony was challenged by the prosecution, noting she was the one who notified the authorities of the confession tapes, but had now joined the defense to discredit Oziel after a tumultuous breakup.

Erik testified that he put cinnamon in his father&#x27;s tea and coffee to make his semen taste better. The plausibility of this claim was disputed because cinnamon is a detectable flavor. Prosecutor Lester Kuriyama proposed that José had not forced Erik into sex acts, but was furious that his son was potentially homosexual, and this may have caused tensions within the family. Judge Weisberg refused to allow Kuriyama to discuss the idea. The defense argued Kuriyama&#x27;s idea was &quot;disgusting&quot;, while Kuriyama argued it was relevant because one witness claimed to have seen gay porn magazines in the house, implying that José was sexually attracted to men; however, the meaning would change if they belonged to Erik. Erik alleged his mother &quot;made it seem like it was worse than death to be gay, and I didn&#x27;t think I was, I just—I don&#x27;t know&quot;, and followed up by saying he liked girls and enjoyed his relationship with his girlfriend.

The prosecution wanted to allow the jury to see a screenplay that Erik had written with his friend Craig in high school, a story about a wealthy young man who killed his parents for the inheritance money. Judge Weisberg ruled against it, saying the play was written too long before the shooting to have relevance.

The defense also won a ruling against the use of the word &quot;sociopath&quot; in front of juries. Oziel told the court he had described to the boys the difference between a crime of passion, and a crime of assault, and that in response they described themselves as &quot;sociopaths&quot;. The judge said the label was too prejudicial to announce in front of a jury. A defense witness, psychologist Anne Tyler, described Erik&#x27;s burglaries of more than $100,000 in cash and jewellery as the &quot;acting out behavior&quot; of an adolescent.

Both verdicts for the brothers were divided by gender; female jurors suggested voluntary manslaughter, while male jurors pushed for first-degree murder. After a month of deliberations, the trial ended in a mistrial due to the two deadlocked juries. As a result, Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti immediately announced that the brothers would be retried.

=== Second trial (1995–1996) ===
The second trial was less publicized, in part because Judge Stanley Weisberg did not allow cameras in the courtroom because it would &quot;increase the risk that jurors would be exposed to information and commentary about the case outside of the courtroom&quot;.

Erik testified over 15 days about allegations of abuse. Judge Weisberg limited some of testimony about some of the allegations of abuse on the third day. Judge Weisberg limited the defense to 64 total witnesses in the retrial. Erik alleged that José had told him he was written out of the will.

Lyle&#x27;s former fiancé, Jamie Pisarcik, testified that Lyle had tried to bribe her to testify falsely in the first trial. Pisarcik said that Lyle told her fictitious stories about the mob killing of his parents, which she originally believed. She testified that during a regular visit to see Lyle in prison, he offered her a large sum of money to claim that José Menendez made sexual advances towards her.

Lyle did not testify in the second trial. Prosecutor David Conn told jurors that Lyle had asked his friend Brian Eslaminia to fabricate a story in the first trial. A 7-page letter was found by the police, allegedly written by Lyle detailing how he wanted him to testify.

The prosecution also had another letter that Lyle had allegedly written to his ex-girlfriend Traci Baker from jail. It included instructions on how to testify, with the sentence: &quot;We will decide later around what date this incident occurred.&quot; The defense disputed its authenticity. Baker was not reached for comment.

Conn challenged Erik&#x27;s allegation that he was raped at the age of 18, when he had a vehicle and enough money to leave his parents&#x27; home. Conn asked him why he did not join the army. Erik said he would not be safe from his father in the army, because he was &quot;the most powerful man I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;. Erik said there was no witnesses to his allegations of sexual abuse.

Psychology professor John Wilson, an expert witness for the defense testified that Erik had symptoms of PTSD which supported his allegations of abuse. Prosecution expert witness, psychiatrist Park Elliot Dietz countered that there was no way to know if he had PTSD because the allegations were unproven. He argued Erik did not show symptoms of &quot;learned helplessness&quot;, as he had purchased guns and practiced with them at the shooting range.

Leslie Abramson argued that the brothers acted out fear that their parents would harm them for threatening to reveal the family&#x27;s secrets, and that the killings were a &quot;highly emotional overkill&quot;.

Judge Weisberg determined that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim that the brothers were in imminent danger when they murdered their parents. However, he allowed the defense to argue that the brothers shot José in the heat of passion, but not their mother, Kitty. He concluded that while there was enough evidence to suggest José might have provoked his sons into committing homicide, there was not enough to indicate that Kitty did.

Klara Wright, wife of the attorney hired by the brothers, testified that the brothers had brought a safe to her home in hopes of locating a copy of their parents&#x27; will. The safe was opened two days after the murders, in the presence of Brian Andersen and Carlos Baralt, the brothers&#x27; uncles. It was found to be empty. Conn argued this was evidence the brothers were trying to access their parents&#x27; money as quickly as possible.

Both brothers were eventually convicted on two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for lying in wait, as well as conspiracy to murder; in the penalty phase of the trial, they were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

During the penalty phase, Abramson reportedly told defense witness William Vicary to edit his own notes of meetings with Erik to remove potentially damning information, but the district attorney&#x27;s office decided not to launch a criminal investigation of Abramson. Both brothers also filed motions for a mistrial, claiming that they suffered irreversible damage in the penalty phase as a result of possible misconduct and ineffective representation by Abramson. On July2, 1996, Weisberg sentenced the brothers to life in prison without the possibility of parole, to be served as consecutive sentences for the killings and the charges of conspiracy to commit murder.

==Appeals==
On February27, 1998, the California Court of Appeal upheld the brothers&#x27; murder convictions and, on May28, 1998, the Supreme Court of California declined to review the case, thus allowing the decision of the appellate court to stand. Both brothers filed &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions with the Supreme Court of California, which were denied in 1999. Having exhausted their appeal remedies in state court, they filed separate &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions in the United States District Court. On March4, 2003, a magistrate judge recommended the denial of the petitions, and the district court adopted the recommendation. The brothers then decided to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On September7, 2005, a three-judge panel denied both their &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions.

In May 2023, the brothers requested a new hearing based upon an allegation that their father had raped former Menudo member Roy Rosselló, who, at that time, was signed under RCA Records. Specifically, on April 18, 2023, on a segment of the &quot;Today Show&quot; about a television documentary, Rosselló stated that when he was 14 years old, he was drugged and raped by José Menendez while he was visiting the Menendez family&#x27;s home in New Jersey. The appeal cites a letter that appears to have been written by Erik to his cousin, Andy Cano, in 1988, where Erik talked about the abuse. Robert Rand, the author of &quot;The Menendez Murders&quot; says he found it in 2018 in a dresser in Cano&#x27;s bedroom.

On October 3, 2024, Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón announced in a press conference that his office was actively reviewing the appeal. On October 24, 2024, George Gascón announced he was asking the court for a resentencing of the case. If a judge accepts his recommendation, the brothers will be eligible for parole. Gascón stated &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that manslaughter would have been the appropriate charge given the premeditation that was involved,&quot; and &quot;I do believe that the brothers were subjected to a tremendous amount of dysfunction in the home, and molestation.&quot; Gascón&#x27;s recommendation considered the length of time the brothers had already served, and their behavior while in prison.

A re-sentencing trial was initially scheduled to begin on December 11, 2024. However, during a court hearing on November 25, 2024, the trial would be pushed back to January 30 and 31, 2025. The resentencing hearing was postponed to March 20, 2025, due to the Los Angeles fires.

== Marriages ==
On July 2, 1996, Lyle married Anna Eriksson at a ceremony attended by Abramson and his aunt Marta Menendez, officiated by Judge Nancy Brown; they divorced on April 1, 2001, after Eriksson discovered that Lyle was cheating on her with another woman. In November 2003, Lyle married Rebecca Sneed at a ceremony in a visiting area of Mule Creek State Prison; they had known each other for around 10 years before their engagement.

On June 12, 1999, Erik married Tammi Ruth Saccoman in the waiting room of Folsom State Prison. Tammi later stated: &quot;Our wedding cake was a Twinkie. We improvised. It was a wonderful ceremony until I had to leave. That was a very lonely night.&quot; In an October 2005 interview with ABC News, she described her relationship with Erik as &quot;something that I&#x27;ve dreamed about for a long time. And it&#x27;s just something very special that I never thought that I would ever have.&quot;

In 2005, Saccoman self-published a book, &quot;They Said We&#x27;d Never Make It – My Life with Erik Menendez&quot;; however, she said on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that Erik also &quot;did a lot of editing on the book&quot;. In an interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine, she stated:

Saccoman also stated that she and her daughter drove every weekend to visit Erik, and that her daughter refers to him as her &quot;Earth Dad&quot;. Discussing his life sentence in a 2005 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Erik stated: &quot;Tammi is what gets me through. I can&#x27;t think about the sentence. When I do, I do it with a great sadness and a primal fear. I break into a cold sweat. It&#x27;s so frightening I just haven&#x27;t come to terms with it.&quot;

* The Menendez brothers are seen in the background of the 1990–91 NBA Hoops&#x27; Mark Jackson basketball card, in which the New York Knicks point guard is seen making a bounce pass. They are sitting courtside behind Jackson. In December 2018, eBay began terminating auctions in which the brothers are mentioned in the listing. Some eBay sellers have continued to sell the card by altering the images accompanying the listing so that the Menendez brothers are neither mentioned nor seen in photos of the card accompanying the listing.

<text>Johann Josef Loschmidt (15 March 1821 – 8 July 1895), better known as Josef Loschmidt, was an Austrian scientist who performed ground-breaking work in chemistry, physics (thermodynamics, optics, electrodynamics), and crystal forms.

Born in Karlsbad, a town in the Austrian Empire (now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic), Loschmidt became professor of physical chemistry at the University of Vienna in 1868.

He had two early mentors. The first was Bohemian priest Adalbert Czech, who persuaded Loschmidt&#x27;s parents to send young Josef to high school in the Piarist monastery in Schlackenwerth and, in 1837, to advanced high-school classes in Prague.

This was followed by two years of philosophy and mathematics at Prague&#x27;s Charles University, where Loschmidt met his second important mentor. This was philosophy professor Franz Serafin Exner, whose eyesight was failing, and who asked Loschmidt to be his personal reader. Exner was known for his innovative school reforms, which included promoting mathematics and science as important subjects. He suggested to Loschmidt, who became a close personal friend, that he apply mathematics to psychological phenomena. In the process of doing this, he became a very able mathematician.

The era, when Loschmidt gradually developed his ideas on molecular structures, was to be a notable epoch in science. It was the time when the Kinetic Theory of Gases was being developed.

His 1861 booklet, &quot;Chemische Studien&quot; (&quot;chemical studies&quot;), proposed two-dimensional representations for over 300 molecules in a style remarkably similar to that used by modern chemists. Among these were aromatic molecules such as benzene (C6H6), and related triazines. Loschmidt symbolized the benzene nucleus by a large circle, which he said was to indicate the yet-undetermined structure of the compound. Some have argued, however, that he intended this as the suggestion of a cyclical structure, four years before that of Kekulé, who is better known and is generally credited with the discovery of benzene&#x27;s cyclic structure.

In 1865, Loschmidt was the first to estimate the size of air molecules: his result was only twice the true size, a remarkable feat given the approximations he had to make. His method allowed the size of any gas molecules to be related to measurable phenomena, and hence to determine how many molecules are in a given volume of gas. This latter quantity is now known as the Loschmidt constant in his honour, and its modern value is molecules per cubic centimetre at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

Loschmidt and his younger university colleague Ludwig Boltzmann became good friends. His critique of Boltzmann&#x27;s attempt to derive the second law of thermodynamics from kinetic theory became famous as the &quot;reversibility paradox&quot;. It led Boltzmann to his statistical concept of entropy as a logarithmic tally of the number of microstates corresponding to a given thermodynamic state.

Loschmidt retired from university in 1891 and died in 1895 in Vienna.

<text>Eureka is an unincorporated town and census-designated place in and the county seat of Eureka County, Nevada, United States. With a population of 414 as of the 2020 United States census, it is the second-largest community in Eureka County. Attractions include the Eureka Opera House (built in 1880 and restored in 1993), Raine’s Market and Wildlife Museum (built 1887), the Jackson House Hotel (built 1877), and the Eureka Sentinel Museum (housed in the 1879 &quot;Eureka Sentinel&quot; Newspaper Building).

Eureka is part of the Elko Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography and climate==
Eureka is located in the southern part of Eureka County, at in the Diamond Mountains, in a draw on the southern end of Diamond Valley, between Antelope and Newark valleys. At the 2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, the population of the census-designated place of Eureka was 480, while the total population of Eureka and the surrounding area (Eureka CCD, Eureka County, Nevada) was 1,313.

The town is located along the Lincoln Highway / U.S. Route 50, nicknamed &quot;The Loneliest Road in America&quot;: aptly named, as the nearest towns along the highway are Austin ( west) and Ely ( east). The nearest town is Duckwater, south.

The climate is typical of the Great Basin: hot and dry with cool mornings in the summer with occasional monsoonal thunderstorms from late July through August; cold and relatively dry in the winter. Temperatures drop to or lower on an average 3.2 mornings during the winter, though in the severe winter of 1916/1917 this happened twenty-five times. They drop to on an average 185.5 mornings, though maximum temperatures top freezing on all but 30.8 days during an average winter. During the summer temperatures rise to or hotter on 12.5 afternoons, though does not occur annually. However, the hottest temperature was on July 22, 1904. Snow accumulations vary from in mild winters to in excess of in more severe years; in the winter of 1906/1907, more than of snow fell.

The wettest calendar year has been 1941 with and the driest 2020 with , whilst May 1917 with has been the wettest single month. The snowiest month has been March 1902 with of fresh snowfall.

Under the Köppen climate classification, Eureka has a cold semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;).



==History==
The town was first settled in 1864 by a group of silver prospectors from nearby Austin, who discovered rock containing a silver-lead ore on nearby Prospect Peak. According to tradition, the town was named from an incident when a prospector exclaimed &quot;Eureka!&quot; when he discovered deposits of silver ore. The town became the county seat in 1873, when Eureka County was carved out of adjacent Lander, Elko, and White Pine counties.

Mining, especially for lead, was the town&#x27;s economic mainstay, as the nearby hillsides ranked as Nevada&#x27;s second-richest mineral producer, behind western Nevada&#x27;s Comstock Lode. Two of the largest concerns in Eureka were the Richmond Mining Company and the Eureka Mining Company. These two companies often collided, and in one instance, their litigation reached the U.S Supreme Court. The population boomed, reaching a high of 10,000 by 1878, but shrank as decreasing mine production and changing market conditions led to the closing of mines.

The town was serviced by the narrow gauge Eureka and Palisade Railroad from 1873 to 1938.

==Demographics==
==Public services==
Eureka is served by an all-volunteer fire department, which provides fire protection, rescue, and vehicle rescue services for Eureka and the surrounding areas. In 2009 a new brick and steel fire house was built on Main Street in Eureka. At the time of its building it was the second largest fire house in the state. In addition to being a modern fire fighting facility, it contains a museum of Eureka fire department equipment and vehicles dating back to the 1870s. The fire-museum may be viewed through the large glass windows, or a tour may be taken by contacting a local fireman.

Eureka boasts three parks, a modern enclosed swimming facility, two baseball fields, a track, and football field.

The 1880s Eureka Opera House was re-modeled in recent times and regularly schedules performers.

The 1876 Eureka Court House is both historic and modern. It stands as the functioning governmental and legal center of Eureka County.

==Education==
Eureka County School District is the local school district.

Eureka has a public library, a branch of the Elko-Lander-Eureka County Library System.

<doc id="663717" wikidata="Q1104649" url="?curid=663717" title="Mr. Prospector">
<text>Mr. Prospector (January 28, 1970 – June 1, 1999) was a Thoroughbred racehorse who became an outstanding breeding stallion and notable sire of sires. A sprinter whose career was cut short by repeated injuries, he won seven of his 14 starts, including the Gravesend Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack and the Whirlaway Handicap at Garden State Park.

Mr. Prospector began his stallion career in Florida as a regional sire. He proved so successful that he was moved to Kentucky where he became a leading sire and later a leading broodmare sire. His descendants have dominated the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing for several decades and his impact on Thoroughbred bloodlines is felt worldwide.

==Background==
Mr. Prospector was a bay stallion who was bred in Kentucky by Leslie Combs II, the owner of Spendthrift Farm. His sire was Raise a Native, a son of Native Dancer. Raise a Native was brilliantly fast but unsound, going undefeated in four races at age two before injury. Raise a Native became a notable sire but tended to pass on his &quot;heavy-topped&quot; build and other conformation issues associated with unsoundness. By contrast, Mr. Prospector&#x27;s dam, Gold Digger, was a multiple stakes winning mare known for her toughness and durability. A daughter of Nashua, Gold Digger was from a highly distinguished female family tracing back to champion racemare and &quot;blue hen&quot; Myrtlewood.

Mr. Prospector was the highest-priced horse at the 1971 Keeneland July sale of selected yearlings, selling to A. I. &quot;Butch&quot; Savin for $220,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). &quot;Mr. P&quot;, as he came to be known, raced for owner Savin under his nom de course, Aisco Stable. The colt was trained by Jimmy Croll, a future Hall of Fame member who went on to train Holy Bull.

At maturity, he reached high. He had excellent hindquarters and strong hind legs, but his right forefront was turned-out and his knees were offset, making him vulnerable to injury.

==Racing career==
Mr. Prospector raced at the same time as Hall of Fame members Secretariat and Forego. Though not of their class, he was the top-ranked sprinter of 1974 on the &quot;Daily Racing Form&#x27;s&quot; Free Handicap.

Mr. Prospector did not race at age two, but won his first two starts at age three with &quot;ridiculous ease&quot; before being sidelined by illness. He returned on April 1, 1973, in a six-furlong allowance race at Gulfstream Park, which he won by nine lengths. The time of 1:07 was a new track record and was only two-fifths of a second off the American record.

He next entered the Calumet Purse on April 17, 1973. In his first start at a distance of more than seven furlongs, he took the early lead but faded in the final quarter-mile to finish third. He next entered the Derby Trial on May 2 as the heavy favorite but finished second after a troubled start. This was his last start at age three.

On February 25, 1974, Mr. Prospector finished third in the Paumonok Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack as the 1-2 favorite. The crowd reportedly responded to the loss by booing jockey Walter Blum &quot;like rutting moose&quot;. He then ran second in the Royal Poinciana on March 6 at Hialeah to Lonetree, who set a track record for seven furlongs.

On April 20, Mr. Prospector won the Whirlaway Handicap at Garden State Racetrack, setting a track record of 1:08 for six furlongs. He then entered the Carter Handicap at Belmont Park on May 18, where he finished second to eventual Horse of the Year Forego. He then finished fourth at the favorite in a turf race, a surface with which the colt was unfamiliar.

Mr. Prospector returned to the winner&#x27;s circle in the Gravesend Handicap, held on June 19 at Belmont Park. As the second choice in a field of eight, he settled in second place behind Lonetree, then pulled away to win by five lengths. Mr. Prospector made what would prove his final start on July 4 in the Firecracker Handicap, finishing second. Shortly afterwards, he fractured a sesamoid bone and was retired.

==Stud career==
Mr. Prospector retired to stud in 1975 at Aisco Farm near Ocala, Florida. As a regional sire with limited support, he exceeded expectations when he became North America&#x27;s leading freshman sire of 1978. In 1980, he was relocated to historic Claiborne Farm in Kentucky. He became an outstanding sire, leading the North American general sire list in 1978 and 1979. From 1,195 named foals, he sired 182 stakes winners (15.1%). Although primarily known for the success of his offspring on the dirt in North America, he also was a top-ten sire for several years in Europe.

Mr. Prospector sired one winner of each of the Triple Crown races, a feat his grandson, Unbridled, also accomplished. His Triple Crown race winners were 2000 Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus; 1985 Preakness Stakes winner Tank&#x27;s Prospect; and 1982 Belmont Stakes winner and American Horse of the Year Conquistador Cielo. Mr. Prospector&#x27;s bloodline has been highly influential in the top echelons of Thoroughbred racing. All eight horses entered into the 2015 Belmont Stakes were descendants, through their sires, of Mr. Prospector. Similarly, all of the horses in the 2018 Kentucky Derby were descendants of Mr. Prospector.

Mr. Prospector&#x27;s stud fee, even without the guarantee of a live foal, peaked at $460,000 in the early and mid-1980s. By March 1994 he was still commanding fees of $170,000-$180,000 even though the market had suffered a downturn. During breeding season, he was often able to &quot;cover&quot; two mares in one day. Mr. Prospector was jointly owned by a 40-member syndicate.

On June 1, 1999, Mr. Prospector died in his stall of complications from colic at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky. He was buried between Nijinsky and Secretariat.

===Major winners===
Mr. Prospector&#x27;s Grade/Group One winners are shown in the table below. The majority raced in North America on the dirt. However, he also had several significant winners in Europe who established more turf-oriented branches of the sire line.

&quot;c = colt, f = filly, g = gelding&quot;

===Influence on the American Triple Crown===
Mr. Prospector&#x27;s male-line descendants have had great success in the American Triple Crown races, primarily through his sons Fappiano, Forty Niner and Smart Strike who themselves became sires of sires.

Mr. Prospector’s lineage can be found in every American Triple Crown race winner from 2012 onward, with the last horse not to contain lineage through Mr. Prospector was 2011 Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom. His lineage extends even further back for the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, as he appears in every pedigree from 2009 onward for those two legs of the triple crown races.

<text>The Cotswold-Severn Group are a series of long barrows erected in an area of western Britain during the Early Neolithic. Around 200 known examples of long barrows are known from the Cotswold-Severn region, although an unknown number of others were likely destroyed prior to being recorded.

==Definition==

The concept of the &quot;Cotswold-Severn group&quot; was coined by 1937 by the archaeologist Glyn Daniel. They represent a regional grouping of long barrows, a broader architectural tradition found across Atlantic Europe. This tradition stretches from southeast Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in the British Isles to the west. Overall, about 40,000 long barrows are known to survive from the Early Neolithic across Europe. The long barrows are not the world&#x27;s oldest known structures using stone—they are predated by Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—but they do represent the oldest widespread tradition of using stone in construction. The archaeologist Frances Lynch has described them as &quot;the oldest built structures in Europe&quot; to survive. Although found across this large area, they can be subdivided into clear regionalised traditions based on architectural differences, of which the Cotswold-Severn Group is one.

The long barrow tradition originated somewhere in the area of modern Spain, Portugal, and western France; here, the long barrows were first erected in the mid-fifth millennium BCE. The tradition then spread north, along the Atlantic coast. It had reached Britain by the first half of the fourth millennium BCE, either soon after farming or in some cases perhaps just before it, and then moved into other parts of northern Europe, for instance arriving in the area of the modern Netherlands by the second half of the fourth millennium BCE.
On the basis of dates ascertained from a number of excavations, Darvill argued that long barrows appeared in the Cotswolds-Severn region fairly abruptly around 3700 BCE. They continued to be built for about 600 years. By 2600 BCE, very few of them had chambers that remained in active use and many had been deliberately blocked up.

Within the Cotswolds-Severn area, there are around 200 known long barrows. An unknown number have been destroyed before ever having been recorded; at least ten of those that had been recorded have since been destroyed or lost.
Over 140 long barrows are known within the Cotswolds area itself.
In northern Wiltshire and in the Dorset chalk hills, the Cotswold-Severn Group of long barrows overlap with the style of earthen barrow found largely across the east of the island.

==Design==

The choice of place in which the Cotswold-Severn long barrows were erected is unlikely to have been random.

Darvill noted that &quot;when these sites were new, they were brutal and hard; bright white rocky mounds covering dark dank shadowy chambers.&quot;

==Funerary deposits==

The Cotswold-Severn Group long barrows usually contained human bone in large quantities, with said barrows averaging the remains of between 40 and 50 individuals each. In some cases, the individual corpses may have been placed into the chamber whole and then left to decay inside; in others, the body may have been dismembered or excarnated outside the barrow before the bones were then placed into the chamber. Usually, the bones of different individuals were jumbled up within the chambers of the tomb, perhaps reflecting a deliberate decision to symbolically merge the individual with the collective dead. In some cases, the bones were segregated into different chambers within the tomb according to age or sex. In most cases, such deposits of human bone were made successively, at various intervals. It is also apparent that in some cases, select bones appear to have been removed from the chambers, perhaps for use in ritualised practices.

When entering the chambers to either add or remove new material, individuals would likely have been exposed to the smell of decaying corpses. It is unknown if entering this area was therefore seen by Early Neolithic Europeans as an ordeal to be overcome or an honourable job to be selected for.

In a few instances, other items were deposited in the chambers with the human bone. Such deposits included pottery, worked flint, pebbles, stone discs, beads, bone pins, dog bones, and most prominently, cattle bone. The deposition of animal bone—especially the skulls of cattle and pigs—was also a common recurring factor in the forecourts of the Cotswold-Severn long barrows. The purpose of these is not known; they may have represented totemic animals, have been seen as protective deposits, or been the remains of feasts.

==Meaning and purpose==

While the purpose and meaning of these long barrows are not known, archaeologists have made suggestions on the basis of recurring patterns that can be observed within the tradition.
Many archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. It has furthermore been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs—which doubled as temples or shrines—to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance. For this reason, the historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments &quot;tomb-shrines&quot; to reflect their dual purpose.

In Britain, these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. The archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on &quot;territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors.&quot; Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups, although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. Many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land, thus representing a change in mindset brought about by the transition from the hunter-gatherer Mesolithic to the pastoralist Early Neolithic. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

==Distribution==
Tombs of this type are concentrated in the Cotswolds but extend as far as Gower and Avebury with some isolated examples in North Wales. Tombs of all three types are generally evenly distributed and it has been theorised that the design evolved over time. Severn-Cotswold tombs share certain features with the transepted gallery graves of the Loire and may have been inspired by these, with the lateral chambers and other differences being local variations.

In the 1960s and 1970s Dr John X. W. P. Corcoran and others argued that the group in fact consisted of three contemporary types, and later excavations have supported this.

==Archaeological investigation==

One of the first major studies of the subject was &quot;The Long Barrows of the Cotswolds&quot;, written by the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford and published in 1925.

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a number of sites in the Cotswold-Severn Group were subject to restoration efforts to turn them into visitor attractions.

<text>William Dole Eckert (January 20, 1909 – April 16, 1971) was a lieutenant general in the United States Air Force,
and later the fourth commissioner of Major League Baseball from to .

== Personal life, career, and death ==
William Eckert was born on January 20, 1909, in Freeport, Illinois, to Frank Lloyd and Harriet Julia (née Rudy) Eckert. His mother had previously been married to George H. McClure, so Eckert had three half-siblings, including Robert A. McClure. The Eckert family moved to Indiana, settling in Madison. In 1924, at age 15, Eckert enlisted in the Indiana National Guard.

Eckert matriculated at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in July 1926. It was there that he earned the nickname &quot;Spike&quot; while playing intramural football.
He also played intramural baseball while at West Point.
He graduated in June 1930.

Eckert served in the U.S. military from 1930 to 1961. In 1940, he married Catherine Douglas Givens. They had two children – William Douglas Eckert and Catherine Julia Eckert.

Upon retirement from the U.S. Air Force in 1961, Eckert was a management consultant and served on the board of directors of several companies. He was the Commissioner of Baseball from 1965 to 1968.

Eckert died in 1971 of a heart attack, while playing tennis in the Bahamas. Eckert is buried in Arlington National Cemetery along with his wife, Catharine Givens Eckert (1919–1995).

== Military career ==
===1930–1940===
In 1930, upon graduation from West Point, Eckert was appointed a second lieutenant of Field Artillery in the Regular Army.

He then attended the Air Corps Flying Schools at Brooks and Kelly Fields in San Antonio, Texas, graduating in October 1931 and was transferred to the Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, Texas. Two months later he transferred to the United States Army Air Corps and was assigned to Selfridge Field, Michigan, for duty with the 36th Pursuit Squadron.

In April 1935, Eckert joined the 29th Pursuit Squadron at Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone, where he was stationed from 1935 to 1937.

In May 1937, he was named a flying instructor at the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Randolph Field, Texas.

In September 1938, he was selected as one of two officers for advanced education at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and in June 1940 graduated with a master&#x27;s degree.

===1940–1950===
After graduating from Harvard, he was assigned to Wright Field, Ohio where he served successively as Production Executive, Comptroller, and as Executive of the Materiel Command.

In January 1944, Eckert entered the Army and Navy Staff College. Upon graduation two months later, Colonel Eckert was assigned to Europe as commander of the 452nd Bomb Group (August 1944 – September 1944) He later served in the European theater as chief of maintenance and chief of supply of the Ninth Air Force Service Command.

In July 1945, Eckert was assigned as executive in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Materiel at Air Force headquarters, and later was appointed chief of the Readjustment and Procurement Division of that office. In November 1947, he was assigned to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force and two months later became executive to the Undersecretary of the Air Force .

In April 1949, Eckert became comptroller of Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

===1950–retirement (1961)===
In October 1951, while comptroller of the Air Materiel Command, Ekhert assumed additional duty as deputy commander of the Air Materiel Command.

Eckert was transferred to Air Force headquarters in June 1952 for duty as assistant deputy chief of staff for materiel.

On July 15, 1956, he reported to Tactical Air Command, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia to assume the duties of deputy commander (redesignated vice commander November 5, 1956).

In 1957, at the age of 48, Eckert was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, making him the youngest three-star officer in the United States Armed Forces.

On February 1, 1960, Eckert was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force for duty as Deputy Chief of Staff, Comptroller of the Air Force. However, after suffering a heart attack in early 1961, he retired from active duty on April 1.

== Commissioner of Major League Baseball ==

Eckert served as the Commissioner of Major League Baseball from 1965 to 1968.

More than 150 names appeared on the original list of nominees for the commissionership following Ford Frick&#x27;s retirement. The club owners initially were unable to decide if the next commissioner should come from the ranks of the game (e.g., the president of the American or National Leagues), or elsewhere. They finally decided that the new commissioner should have a strong business background to deal with the problems that were confronting the game at the time.

Eckert had not appeared on any lists of prospective candidates at first. He only became a serious candidate for the commissionership after fellow officer Curtis LeMay gave Major League Baseball a recommendation for him. On November 17, 1965, by a unanimous vote of the then-20 major league club owners, William Eckert became the fourth Commissioner of Major League Baseball.

When he became commissioner, Eckert had not seen a baseball game in person in over ten years. He was almost completely unknown to the public, leading sportswriters to nickname him &quot;the Unknown Soldier.&quot;

He incurred the public&#x27;s ire by refusing to cancel games after the assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., and team owners&#x27; disdain because he refused to deal forcefully with substantive business issues. By 1968, the owners anticipated a players&#x27; strike, and had long since lost confidence in Eckert&#x27;s ability to handle the situation. For this reason, Eckert was forced to resign at the end of the season, although he still had three years on his contract.
Eckert resigned as commissioner in December 1968. Bowie Kuhn was appointed the interim commissioner.

In spite of his much publicized failures and shortcomings, Eckert also developed more effective committee actions, streamlined business methods and helped stabilize franchises with bigger stadiums and long-term leases. In addition, Eckert worked hard toward promoting the game internationally, including a 1966 tour of Japan by the Los Angeles Dodgers.

<text>The Colorado House of Representatives is the lower house of the Colorado General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Colorado. The House is composed of 65 members from an equal number of constituent districts, with each district having roughly 80 thousand people. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, and are limited to four consecutive terms in office, but can run again after a four-year respite.

The Colorado House of Representatives convenes at the State Capitol in Denver.

==Committees==
The House have 11 current committees of reference:
*House Agriculture, Livestock, and Water Committee
*House Appropriations Committee
*House Business Affairs and Labor
*House Education
*House Energy and Environment Committee
*House Finance Committee
*House Health and Insurance Committee
*House Judiciary Committee
*House Public and Behavioral Health and Human Services Committee
*House State, Civic, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee
*House Transportation and Local Government Committee Committee

== Past composition of the House of Representatives ==
== Women who served in the House of Representatives ==

The first women who served in the Colorado House of Representatives were Clara Cressingham, Carrie Holly and Frances Klock. All three were elected to serve in 1895-1896.
Carrie Holly introduced and passed a Bill that raised the age of consent for girls from 16 to 18 and another that gave mothers the same rights to their children as fathers. 

A total of 10 women served in the period up to 1904, the last of them being Alice Ruble, after which the party leaders declared that &#x27;no woman will ever again be elected to the (Colorado) legislature&#x27;

Their prediction proved wrong, as demonstrated by the list of subsequent women members of the House.

<text>Set Your Goals is the debut studio album by the punk rock band CIV. It was released in October 1995 on Lava Records. The album is best known for the hit single &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait One Minute More.&quot;

Although listed as co-producer in the inlay, Walter Schreifels has indicated that he was the main songwriter for the album (despite not being a member of the band).

&quot;Can&#x27;t Wait One Minute More&quot; and &quot;Choices Made&quot; were released as music videos.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Wait One Minute More&quot; features vocals from Lou Koller of Sick Of It All.

The San Francisco Bay-area pop punk/hardcore act Set Your Goals named themselves after this album.

==Critical reception==
Ira Robbins, in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, wrote: &quot;Making the most of clear sound, tight, unfussy playing and a full complement of rhythmic shifts (these guys remember when moshing was a dance tempo, not a slamming catch-all), CIV recycles with detailed dignity.&quot;

<text>Entrance grave is a type of Neolithic and early Bronze Age chamber tomb found primarily in Great Britain. The burial monument typically consisted of a circular mound bordered by a stone curb, erected over a rectangular burial chamber and accessed by a narrow, stone lined entrance. Entrance graves have been discovered in the Isles of Scilly, west Cornwall, southeast Ireland, southwest Scotland, Brittany and the Channel Islands. They are often referred to as the &quot;Scillonian Group&quot;, named for the Scillonian Islands where the majority of entrance graves have been discovered.

==History==
Entrance graves in Britain are also known as Scillonian entrance graves, because the majority of these ancient burial monuments are found on the Isles of Scilly, a group of islands 25 miles (40 m) west of Cornwall. The islands were originally settled during the Neolithic era, circa 2500 BC. Burials on the islands range in date from the later Neolithic period to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2500–1000 BC). Over eighty entrance graves have been recorded on the Isles of Scilly. Many date to the late Neolithic period and continued in use until the beginning of the eighth century BC. Excavated entrance graves have contained human remains, cremation urns, and pottery fragments. The excavation of the Knackyboy Carn entrance grave on St. Martin&#x27;s Island uncovered sixty or more cremated individuals. Entrance graves continued to be built on the Isles of Scilly for many years after individual burials had become the standard burial practice on the mainland of Britain. Besides being used for interments, it has been suggested that entrance graves could have been used for ritualistic and cultural purposes, or to mark land boundaries between different family groups.

==Description==
An entrance grave usually consisted of a circular mound of stacked rubble and earth, generally up to 25m in diameter. The edge of the mound would be marked with stone. The mound encompassed a rectangular, roofed burial chamber lined with stone, either large slabs or rubble masonry. Many graves have a narrow entrance or passage lined with stone slabs. The chamber roof was typically covered by small stones are large granite slabs. Some grave entrance are blocked with a large stone. Entrance graves may contain single or multiple interments and occur in small or large groups. Along with other types of megalithic chambered tombs, entrance graves are found in western Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, southeast Ireland, southwest Scotland, the Channel Islands and Brittany. In Britain, the majority of entrance graves are located on the Isles of Scilly.

<doc id="663752" wikidata="Q6231578" url="?curid=663752" title="John Eliot, 1st Earl of St Germans">
<text>John Eliot, 1st Earl of St Germans (30 September 1761 – 17 November 1823), known as the Lord Eliot from 1804 to 1815, was a British politician.
Eliot was born at Port Eliot, Cornwall, the third son (second surviving) of Edward Craggs-Eliot, 1st Baron Eliot, and his wife Catherine Elliston. He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, taking an M.A. in 1784. He served from 1780 to 1783 as Member of Parliament for St Germans and from 1784 to 1804 for Liskeard. He also held the position of His Majesty&#x27;s Remembrancer in the Court of the Exchequer. On 17 February 1804 he succeeded his father as second Baron Eliot. In 1808 he became Colonel of the East Cornwall Militia, and in 1810, Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant.

On 28 November 1815, Eliot was created Earl of Saint Germans, in the County of Cornwall, with a special remainder to his brother William Eliot and his heirs male. In February 1816 he took his seat in the House of Lords.

==Family==
John married twice but without issue:

# On 9 September 1790 at St James Church, Westminster to Caroline Yorke (29 August 1765 – 26 July 1818). Caroline was a daughter of Charles Yorke, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.
# On 19 August 1819 to Harriet Pole-Carew (9 February 1790 – 4 March 1877). She was the daughter of Reginald Pole-Carew.

Lord St Germans died on 17 November 1823 at Port Eliot, and was buried on 27 November at St Germans Church. He was succeeded by his brother William Eliot, 2nd Earl of St Germans.

<doc id="663761" wikidata="Q2086858" url="?curid=663761" title="Trilobyte">
<text>Trilobyte Games, LLC (formerly Trilobyte, Inc.) is an American video game developer based in Medford, Oregon. The company was founded in February 1991 by Graeme Devine and Rob Landeros, who had been fired from Virgin Games after pitching their idea for &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;. They developed the game as Trilobyte and followed it up with &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;. Following a string of less successful titles and cancellations, the company shut down in February 1999. In 2010, Landeros resurrected the name under Trilobyte Games.

== History ==
Graeme Devine and Rob Landeros founded Trilobyte on February 1, 1991, after being fired from Virgin Interactive. They established the first office in the second floor above J&#x27;Ville Tavern in Jacksonville, Oregon.

===&quot;The 7th Guest&quot;===
&quot;The 7th Guest&quot; was one of the first computer games for CD-ROM. Most of the footage for the game was filmed with a US$35,000 budget, Super VHS cameras, and blue butcher paper as a background that would later be removed using chromakey to insert the actors in the game. In the game, the player must move around the map solving puzzles in a style similar to &quot;Myst&quot;. Most of the puzzles in &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; were based on versions of pre-existing puzzles invented by people such as Max Bezzel. The 7th Guest was the first game to use full rendered 3D animation and navigation. For the time, it had state-of-the-art graphics by Rob Landeros, Robert Stein III, Gene Bodio, Alan Iglesias, MIDI music by The Fat Man, and a story by Matthew J. Costello. During planning, a sequel was being considered. The final version of &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; was released in April 1993, with 60,000 copies sold overnight.

The game was a turning point in CD-ROM based technology. Bill Gates called &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; &quot;the new standard in interactive entertainment.&quot;

===&quot;The 11th Hour&quot;===
&quot;The 11th Hour&quot; was released in the winter of 1995, after missing its original release date by more than a year. It was one of the first games to support 16-bit color, with detailed environments and fluid motion. However, the game drew criticism for several reasons:

* The game was released in DOS when Windows 95 was dominant in the market
* The game still used MIDI for music, instead of CD audio.
* Gameplay featuring puzzles and riddles, which ranged from abstract logic to anagrams. 

Despite pre-orders, sales did not meet the expected amount, and the game did not recover its production costs. This was a key factor in the company&#x27;s financial downfall.

===Subsequent projects===
The next projects for Trilobyte were published by Trilobyte itself. &quot;Clandestiny&quot;, with gameplay similar to the previous &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, and &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;, though using cel animated (cartoon) video rather than live action, and &quot;Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, a re-packaging of a number of the puzzles and games from &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;, and &quot;Clandestiny&quot;. Neither were commercially successful.

It has been reported that the relationship between Landeros and Devine became so strained that they last spoke to each other at a board meeting in November 1996.

After &quot;Clandestiny&quot;, the company effectively took two different internal directions. Landeros led a project called &quot;Tender Loving Care&quot;, while Devine started a Massively Multiplayer project, &quot;Millennium&quot;. &quot;Tender Loving Care,&quot; starring John Hurt, was completed in 1998.

About the same time, Red Orb Entertainment, a division of Broderbund, signed on to publish two titles on Devine&#x27;s &quot;side&quot; of the company – &quot;Assault!&quot;, a top-down multiplayer action game, and &quot;Extreme Racing&quot;, a racing game, which ran on a shared game engine. &quot;Assault!&quot; was later renamed &quot;Extreme Warfare&quot; and changed from top-down to a first person perspective. &quot;Extreme Racing&quot; was retitled &quot;Baja 1000 Racing&quot; and attached to a SCORE International racing license. Both games made appearances at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) trade show that year.

===Closing===
In June 1998, The Learning Company acquired Broderbund. The Learning Company was not interested in any kind of online games and thus canceled Trilobyte&#x27;s by September. Unable to find another publisher for its projects, the company cut payroll on September 15, 1998. Publishers like Electronic Arts and especially Midway Games were interested in acquiring the company. By December, Trilobyte was close to reaching an agreement with Midway and Devine unsuccessfully sought funding from Paul Allen to keep the company afloat until it was finalized. However, the publisher stopped calling at the end of the month and, in January 1999, the company was being evicted. Trilobyte had its last day of operations on February 2, 1999. Devine took up a job at id Software and led the design of &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;. Other staffers were hired by the nascent local company N&#x27;Lightning Software Development to develop &quot;Catechumen&quot;.

===Relaunch===
In November 2010, Trilobyte was resurrected. &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; was relaunched for the iPhone and iPad in December 2010. In April 2011, &quot;The 7th Guest: Infection&quot;—a stand-alone version of the popular Microscope Puzzle from the original &quot;7th Guest&quot;—was released for iPad.

===&quot;The 7th Guest 3&quot;===
On Halloween 2013, Trilobyte launched a Kickstarter campaign for &quot;The 7th Guest 3: The Collector&quot;, which failed to meet its funding target of $435,000. Another crowdfunding campaign was started at Crowdtilt with a smaller goal of $65,000 to build the first story of the haunted mansion but that too, failed, and the 7th Guest 3 was officially cancelled in June 2014.

== Released games ==
*&quot;The 7th Guest&quot; – the first title released by Trilobyte Software. It sold over 2 million copies, making more than US$50 million for the company in the 1990s. It was re-released for iPhone and iPad in December 2010, and re-released for PC by DotEmu in February 2012 as an updated version. It was also re-released for PC by GOG in a smaller package. On 13 March 2012 The 7th Guest for MacIntosh was released on the Mac App Store.

*&quot;The 11th Hour&quot; – the sequel to &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;. Many production problems and release date slipped by a year resulted in lost profits and sales of 1.7 million units. This game was also re-released in February 2012 for PC by both DotEmu and GOG.

*&quot;Clandestiny&quot; – a cel animated child-friendly puzzle game. It sold only 2,500 copies in the United States, bringing in a profit of just US$500,000. The game is currently available in the Mac App Store and published by GRL Games.

*&quot;Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; – a compilation of some of the puzzles from &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;, and &quot;Clandestiny&quot;. It sold 27 copies in the United States, and 127 worldwide.

*&quot;The 7th Guest: Infection&quot; – a stand-alone version of the Microscope Puzzle from the original release of &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, which was excluded from the re-released iPhone and iPad versions due to technical issues. Released as an app for iPad in April 2011.

== Unreleased games ==
*&quot;Cybernet&quot; – The Fat Man has listed on his website that he composed the music for this game.

*&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; – An office politics simulator. At a cost of over US$800,000, it was scrapped halfway through production.

*&quot;The 7th Guest III&quot; – A game where the house would be back to its original form and all forms of media were to be controlled by Satan. US$500,000 went into production. Only a few highly rendered screen shots were created before the project was cancelled.

*&quot;Extreme Warfare&quot; – Graeme Devine&#x27;s online top-down perspective 3D tank game, originally named &quot;Assault&quot;. Red Orb Entertainment was sold to The Learning Company, who cancelled the game.

*&quot;Baja Racing&quot; – originally called &quot;Extreme Racing&quot;. It was shelved due to the lack of development personnel.

*&quot;The 13th Soul&quot; – a 3rd-person real time game inside the Stauf mansion. A few rendered rooms were made. The sale of Virgin Interactive resulted in the cancellation of the project.

*&quot;Trojan Planet&quot; – a role-playing game set in a parallel universe where all the world is Troy. The company went under shortly after the concept arose.

*&quot;The 7th Guest III (3rd Version)&quot; – Another version in which the town was abandoned and Tad (the young boy from the &quot;7th Guest&quot;) was grown up and a writer, coming back to stop Stauf. The company went under shortly after the concept arose.

*&quot;The 7th Guest III: The Collector&quot; – A completely new version of &quot;7th Guest III&quot; where the events took place in a German museum rather than the Stauf house. Lack of funding and interest by the producer Lunny Interactive caused it to be shelved. Trilobyte later sought crowdfunding for a different concept bearing a similar title, but it was cancelled in June 2014.

<text>The Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace is the mother church and cathedral of the Diocese of Honolulu.

==History==
===Groundbreaking===
The first Catholic missionaries to Hawaii, three priests of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (also known as the Society of Picpus), arrived in Honolulu from France on July 7, 1827. Apostolic prefect Alexis Bachelot celebrated the first recorded Catholic Mass on Hawaiian soil on July 14 in a grass hut on a rented lot. On August 30, 1827, the missionaries acquired a royal land grant from 14-year-old King Kamehameha III with the help from the Catholic governor of Oahu, high chief Boki. On this property, in January 1828, the French erected the first Catholic church in Hawaii where the sanctuary of the cathedral is today.

However, King Kamehameha III under pressure by both American Protestant missionaries and the Kuhina Nui, Kaʻahumanu, Catholic priests were expelled from the islands between 1829 and 1839 to thwart any French or Catholic influence. During this “dark decade” of anti-Catholic persecution, foreign priests were deported and not allowed to come to shore, and known converts were tortured and imprisoned. Under the threat of force from the French government, the Hawaiian government issued the Edict of Toleration on June 17, 1839, creating freedom of religious expression. As reparation, Kamehameha III gave the first Roman Catholic missionaries under the leadership of Vicar Apostolic Étienne Rouchouze, a piece of the royal estate on which to build the first Roman Catholic church in the kingdom and $20,000 in compensation for the deportation of priests and the incarceration and torture of converts. The 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii enshrined religious liberty.

The missionaries broke ground for the new church on July 9, 1840, coinciding with the Feast of Our Lady of Peace, patroness saint of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts and dedicated their first church in the new land under this title of the Virgin Mary. A Mass was celebrated on the day of groundbreaking and 280 native Hawaiians received the sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and first Eucharist. The cornerstone of the building was ceremonially laid on August 6, 1840. Construction continued after groundbreaking with native Hawaiian volunteers harvesting blocks of coral from the shores of Ala Moana, Kakaako, and Waikīkī. Down the street, Congregationalist missionaries had earlier begun the construction of Kawaiahao Church.

===Development===
On August 15, 1843, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace was consecrated and dedicated, and about 800 people received holy communion.

When Louis Désiré Maigret inherited the church, the interior was furnished with a simple wooden altar, communion rail and pulpit. Instead of pews, the native Hawaiians preferred to sit on the floor covered in lauhala mats. Maigret had purchased a tower clock and cathedra, and a new larger bell. Maigret had built the first domed bell tower in the Hawaiian Islands, but he would later replace it with a wooden spire topped with a globus cruciger and a stationary rooster finial in 1866, often mistaken for a weather vane.

In the 1870s, after returning from the First Vatican Council, Maigret was inspired to continue improvements to the cathedral. In 1871, the low roof was replaced with redwood and raised by four feet. A vaulted ceiling with panels of hand-painted gold leaf decorations was installed. A choir loft and galleries overlooking the nave were built to increase the seating capacity and new stained glass windows were added. Thirty-six statuettes of the saints were placed above the gallery overlooking the nave partly as spite towards the Congregationalists and Presbyterians who accused Catholics of idolatry. Extensive work was done to install a French marble altar which had a poignant backdrop scene of Calvary. It was crowned by the gilded statues of the Virgin Mary, Saint Joachim and Saint Anne. The clock, which was originally positioned at the base of the tower, was now fitted on the back wall after the roof was raised and remains the oldest clock in Hawaii. Throughout his thirty-five years as bishop, Maigret transformed the humble grass hut into a European-styled church before dying in 1882.

The cathedral would remain rather unchanged for the next two decades. In December 1893, on the sixty-second anniversary of the first expulsion from the Hawaiian Islands of the first prefect apostolic, Msgr. Gulstan Ropert dedicated a large bronze statue of Our Lady of Peace, a recreation of an original 16th century wooden carving still venerated by the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts in their Paris convent.

When Libert Hubert John Louis Boeynaems inherited the church in 1903, he idealized the cathedral to be like the more famous Gothic churches of his native Europe, perhaps motivated by the nearby Anglican St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral which was completed in 1902. He commissioned the construction of an elaborate porch which was completed in 1910. However, the Gothic endeavor became too costly to complete. Instead, he replaced the termite damaged wooden floors with cement and the wooden spire with a concrete bell tower topped with the original orb and cross installed by Maigret.

In 1926, Stephen Peter Alencastre assumed the episcopacy of the Hawaiian Islands. Not long after his appointment, Alencastre purchased land at the base of Punchbowl Crater to build a new cathedral. Stymied by the Great Depression of 1929, the project was cancelled. Instead, he established the present-day Romanesque revival style for the cathedral. The Gothic porch was replaced by a portico of doric columns. New stained-glass windows from Germany were installed. The Italian government presented a gift of a new Carrara marble altar with statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph, in anticipation for the celebration of the centennial of the arrival of the first Roman Catholic missionaries to the Hawaiian Islands. In 1940, steel trusses and concrete buttresses were added to support the terra cotta tiled roof that were installed in 1926.

===Second Vatican Council===
James Joseph Sweeney, was the first bishop of newly formed Diocese of Honolulu. In 1956, Bishop Sweeney made some significant changes to the interior. The wooden crucifix was removed and replaced with one made of marble, and behind it, the Calvary scene was painted over and a simple fleur-de-lis patterned wallpaper was added. A gothic tester (or &quot;baldachin&quot;) was positioned above the high altar to match the canopy over the cathedra, then a bronze tabernacle and communion rails were fitted.

Liturgically innovative ideas in the 1960s and 1970s took hold of some liturgists and theologians after the Second Vatican Council. These ideas, which claimed to follow the &quot;spirit of the council,&quot; inaugurated controversial changes in the architectural standards of churches worldwide, which some Catholics dub a &quot;wreckovation&quot;. Sweeney, a council father at the Second Vatican Council, ordered for the communion rails to be removed and a freestanding altar constructed to allow a priest to face the congregation during Mass instead of &quot;ad orientem&quot; as indicated in the changes to the new Roman Missal. The elevated canopied pulpit was also removed in favor of a simple lectern to serve as an ambo. The ideology of this time encouraged churches to use native cultural implements in church architecture. Koa wood wainscot along the walls and heavy koa wood doors were installed.
===Post-Vatican II===
The cathedral had become too small to accommodate the increased population since its vicariate apostolic times. Joseph Anthony Ferrario, the third bishop of the diocese, successfully petitioned Pope John Paul II to elevate Saint Theresa Catholic Church to a co-cathedral in 1984. 

Meanwhile, Ferrario was also responsible for sending the thirty-six statuettes of saints back to France to be professionally preserved. When the statues returned, they were placed in a new, more logical order of placement in accordance with the Litany of the Saints. In one of the most drastic changes yet, pews were re-arranged to face each other while the altar and ambo were positioned in the center aisle in 1993. A eucharistic devotional area was created in front of the tabernacle and a semitransparent screen was raised to separate it from the rest of the church. The cathedra of the bishop was placed in front of this screen and the , or the chair of the priest-celebrant, was positioned among the pews.

Francis X. DiLorenzo, fourth bishop of Honolulu hired architects to draft plans for an expansion of the cathedral but never progressed. DiLorenzo&#x27;s capital improvement projects included the replacement of the flooring with stone tiles and installation of new sound systems.

In 2010, a $15M campaign was initiated by the fifth and current bishop, Clarence Richard Silva, to renovate the cathedral emulating the appearance of the later 1800s during the time of Damien de Veuster. The &quot;renewal&quot; project also includes installing replica oil-paintings of the Stations of the Cross that were present in the cathedral during the time period, &quot;oil lamp&quot; chandeliers, and confessionals. Other major plans include building a new chapel that will house the relics of both St. Damien de Veuster and St. Marianne Cope.

By 2018, at the hundred seventy-fifth anniversary of the dedication of the cathedral, Silva removed the screen and returned the altar back to an extensively renovated sanctuary area. The pews were also positioned back to their direction. Four of the fourteen stained-glass windows were repaired and refurbished in Omaha. A few years later, the pillars were repaired and replastered then repainted to mimic marbled stone, and new paintings of saints Damien and Marianne were placed in the sanctuary wall above the high altar.

==Historical significance==
Its perilous beginnings and fruitful growth has left an indelible mark on the history of Hawaii. The cathedral is reminder of the great religious struggles that took place in the Hawaiian Kingdom between 1820 and 1850, and as a symbol of its final acceptance of the Catholic Church. It was the church in which Damien de Veuster was ordained to the presbyterate on May 21, 1864, the starting point in the ministry of Mother Marianne Cope in Hawaii on November 8, 1883, and also the church where the Requiem Mass for Joseph Kahahawai was conducted in 1932. It is the oldest existing building in the downtown area of Honolulu. Considering the earliness of its construction date, it is also of considerable aesthetic value and is unique in its architectural design in Hawaii. The Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace was placed on the Hawaii Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
The Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace is said to be the oldest cathedral in continuous use in the United States. Though older, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Baltimore, completed in 1821, was a co-cathedral throughout its history. The current Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans was completed in 1850 after the Great New Orleans Fire destroyed the original 1727 church in 1788. The Royal Presidio Chapel, completed in 1791, was designated a pro-cathedral in 1849.

===Burials===
Following the Requiem Mass (funeral) of Bishop Louis-Désiré Maigret in 1882, his body was carried in procession to the King Street Cemetery but was not buried there. His final resting place goes unrecorded for 100 years until his tomb is discovered under the sanctuary of the cathedral during renovations in 1981. Other vicar apostolics were buried at the King Street Cemetery.

The only other bishop buried at the cathedral is John Joseph Scanlan who was buried in an adjacent space near Maigret after his death in 1997. Four additional spaces were created for future prelates in the renovations that were completed in 2018.

The mortal remains of St. Marianne Cope were enshrined on July 31, 2014. The Sisters of St. Francis of the Neumann Communities announced that they were closing their motherhouse in Syracuse where the remains were originally. The remains are encased in a reliquary near the sanctuary next to the relic of St. Damien.

===Elevation to a Minor Basilica===
Pope Francis, through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, conferred the title of Minor Basilica upon the Cathedral on May 10, 2014, the liturgical memorial of St. Damien. The inaugural Mass was celebrated on October 11, 2014, the fifth anniversary of the canonization of St. Damien. The privileges attached to the status of minor basilica include the right of the umbraculum (ceremonial canopy) and the tintinnabulum (ceremonial bell), which were carried in procession and installed at this inaugural Mass.

==Pipe organ==

The first pipe organ, installed shortly after the cathedral was built, came from France and had one manual and a pedal clavier. The second organ, fitted in 1885, was built in England as the gift of parishioner Godfrey Rhodes, featuring great, swell, and pedal organs. The large statue of Saint Cecilia, patroness of sacred music, was placed on the casing in front of the organ in 1906.

The third and present one, Opus 916, consists of great, swell, choir, and pedal organs installed in the choir loft by organ-builder Alfred G. Tickner of the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company of Boston. It features 3 manuals, 37 stops, 33 ranks, and 2,159 pipes. This instrument was solemnly blessed on September 9, 1934, by Msgr. Stephen Alencastre, followed by a dedicatory recital by organist Don George, broadcast over radio station KGU in Honolulu.

==Campus==

The church at 1175 Fort Street Mall is just one building in a larger campus owned by the Diocese of Honolulu and purchased during the Hawaiian Kingdom Era from Charles Brewer, Charles Reed Bishop, Julius Anthon, Joseph Carter, Alexander Muir, James Makee and Romila Whiting. Much of the land was formerly used as a boarding and day school in the late 1800s – the predecessor institution of Saint Louis School. The campus includes the Diocesan Chancery which houses the offices of the bishop and vicar general, as well as the &quot;Hawaii Catholic Herald&quot; newspaper. The same high-rise building also houses the rectory, the office and residence of the rector, the parochial vicar and other priests serving the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.

The diocese has leased some of the campus to commercial entities. The Century Square building, a modern skyscraper at 1188 Bishop Street, is rented as office and residential space. Finance Factors is a minority landowner where the Finance Factors building sits. Plans are in place for a new affordable housing development for seniors where the parish hall used to stand. Directly beneath the campus is a cavernous basin dug by early missionaries as a freshwater well. It is now leased to a private company which operates it as an underground public parking lot.

<text>Nordic walking is a Finnish-origin total-body version of walking that can be done both by non-athletes as a health-promoting physical activity and by athletes as a sport. The activity is performed with specially designed walking poles similar to ski poles.

==History==
Nordic walking (originally Finnish &quot;sauvakävely&quot;) is fitness walking with specially designed poles. While trekkers, backpackers, and skiers had been using the basic concept for decades, Nordic walking was first formally defined with the publication of &quot;Hiihdon lajiosa&quot; (translation: &quot;A part of cross-country skiing training methodic&quot;) by Mauri Repo in 1979. Nordic walking&#x27;s concept was developed on the basis of off-season ski-training activity done using one-piece ski poles.

For decades hikers and backpackers used their one-piece ski poles long before trekking and Nordic walking poles came onto the scene. Ski racers deprived of snow have always used and still do use their one-piece ski poles for ski walking and hill bounding. The first poles specially designed and marketed to fitness walkers were produced by Exerstrider of the US in 1988. &quot;Nordic Walker&quot; poles were produced and marketed by Exel in 1997. Exel coined and popularized the term &#x27;Nordic Walking&#x27; in 1999.

==Benefits==
Compared to regular walking, Nordic walking (also called pole walking) involves applying force to the poles with each stride. Nordic walkers use more of their entire body (with greater intensity) and receive fitness building stimulation not present in normal walking for the chest, latissimus dorsi muscle, triceps, biceps, shoulder, abdominals, spinal and other core muscles that may result in significant increases in heart rate at a given pace. Nordic walking has been estimated as producing up to a 46% increase in energy consumption, compared to walking without poles.
Several research studies have been conducted on the effects of Nordic walking. One study in particular compared regular walking to Nordic walking. This study showed that Nordic walking led to more significant decreases in BMI and waist circumference compared to regular walking. The Nordic walking group was the only group that experienced reductions in total body fat and increases in aerobic capacity. Another research study that was done compared the effects of Nordic walking, conventional walking, and resistance-band training on overall fitness in older adults. The study concluded that while all three methods are useful for improving overall fitness, Nordic walking is the most effective. Harvard Medical School has evidence that shows Nordic walking has more calorie burning characteristics than regular walking. 

==Equipment==
Nordic walking poles are significantly shorter than those recommended for cross-country skiing. Nordic walking poles come in one-piece, non-adjustable shaft versions, available in varying lengths, and telescoping two or three piece twist-locking versions of adjustable length. One piece poles are generally stronger and lighter, but must be matched to the user. Telescoping poles are &#x27;one-size fits all&#x27;, and are more transportable.

Nordic walking poles feature a range of grips and wrist-straps, or rarely, no wrist-strap at all. The straps eliminate the need to tightly grasp the grips.
As with many trekking poles, Nordic walking poles come with removable rubber tips for use on hard surfaces and hardened metal tips for trails, the beach, snow and ice. Most poles are made from lightweight aluminium, carbon fiber, or composite materials. Special walking shoes are not required, although there are shoes being marketed as specifically designed for the sport.

==Technique==
The cadences of the arms, legs and body are, rhythmically speaking, similar to those used in normal, vigorous, walking. The range of arm movement regulates the length of the stride. Restricted arm movements will mean a natural restricted pelvic motion and stride length. The longer the pole thrust, the longer the stride and more powerful the swing of the pelvis and upper torso.

<doc id="663772" wikidata="Q375520" url="?curid=663772" title="Strict conditional">
<text>In logic, a strict conditional (symbol: formula_1, or ⥽) is a conditional governed by a modal operator, that is, a logical connective of modal logic. It is logically equivalent to the material conditional of classical logic, combined with the necessity operator from modal logic. For any two propositions &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, the formula &quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot; says that &quot;p&quot; materially implies &quot;q&quot; while formula_2 says that &quot;p&quot; strictly implies &quot;q&quot;. Strict conditionals are the result of Clarence Irving Lewis&#x27;s attempt to find a conditional for logic that can adequately express indicative conditionals in natural language. They have also been used in studying Molinist theology.

==Avoiding paradoxes==
The strict conditionals may avoid paradoxes of material implication. The following statement, for example, is not correctly formalized by material implication:

: If Bill Gates graduated in medicine, then Elvis never died.

This condition should clearly be false: the degree of Bill Gates has nothing to do with whether Elvis is still alive. However, the direct encoding of this formula in classical logic using material implication leads to:

: Bill Gates graduated in medicine → Elvis never died.

This formula is true because whenever the antecedent &quot;A&quot; is false, a formula &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is true. Hence, this formula is not an adequate translation of the original sentence. An encoding using the strict conditional is:

: formula_1 (Bill Gates graduated in medicine → Elvis never died).

In modal logic, this formula means (roughly) that, in every possible world in which Bill Gates graduated in medicine, Elvis never died. Since one can easily imagine a world where Bill Gates is a medicine graduate and Elvis is dead, this formula is false. Hence, this formula seems to be a correct translation of the original sentence.

==Problems==
Although the strict conditional is much closer to being able to express natural language conditionals than the material conditional, it has its own problems with consequents that are necessarily true (such as 2 + 2 = 4) or antecedents that are necessarily false. The following sentence, for example, is not correctly formalized by a strict conditional:

: If Bill Gates graduated in medicine, then 2 + 2 = 4.

Using strict conditionals, this sentence is expressed as:

: formula_1 (Bill Gates graduated in medicine → 2 + 2 = 4)

In modal logic, this formula means that, in every possible world where Bill Gates graduated in medicine, it holds that 2 + 2 = 4. Since 2 + 2 is equal to 4 in all possible worlds, this formula is true, although it does not seem that the original sentence should be. A similar situation arises with 2 + 2 = 5, which is necessarily false:

: If 2 + 2 = 5, then Bill Gates graduated in medicine.

Some logicians view this situation as indicating that the strict conditional is still unsatisfactory. Others have noted that the strict conditional cannot adequately express counterfactual conditionals, and that it does not satisfy certain logical properties. In particular, the strict conditional is transitive, while the counterfactual conditional is not.

Some logicians, such as Paul Grice, have used conversational implicature to argue that, despite apparent difficulties, the material conditional is just fine as a translation for the natural language &#x27;if...then...&#x27;. Others still have turned to relevance logic to supply a connection between the antecedent and consequent of provable conditionals.

==Constructive logic==
In a constructive setting, the symmetry between ⥽ and formula_1 is broken, and the two connectives can be studied independently. Constructive strict implication can be used to investigate interpretability of Heyting arithmetic and to model arrows and guarded recursion in computer science.

<doc id="663776" wikidata="Q1523627" url="?curid=663776" title="Giants' grave">
<text>Giants&#x27; grave (; or ) is the name given by local people and archaeologists to a type of Sardinian megalithic gallery grave built during the Bronze Age by the Nuragic civilization. They were collective tombs and can be found throughout Sardinia, with 800 being discovered there.

A stone cairn lies over the burial chambers, with some examples having a cup-shaped entrance similar to the court cairn tombs of Ireland.

==Types==
There are two general types of giants&#x27; tomb. In the so-called &quot;slab type&quot;, uncut slabs are buried on end in the ground, and are arranged side-by-side. There is usually a central stele, which is the largest slab (up to 4 m in height) and has a doorway cut through it.

In the more primitive slab-type giants tombs, the central slab is unmodified aside from the entrance that is cut through it at the base, or else there is a crude dolmen-like arrangement of 3 uncut rocks to form the entrance (Osono, Sortali, Lolghi, Pescaredda). In more advanced slab-type giants tombs, the central slab is modified so as to be rounded on top, and has a simple design carved into the front surface (Dorgali, Goronna, Santu Bainzu, Coddu Vecchju).
The sepulchres have a characteristic rectangular plan with an apse. The burial chamber is usually 5 to 15 metres long and 1 to 2 metres high. The structures were originally covered by a mound resembling the shape of an overturned ship. Near the entrance an obelisk (&quot;betile&quot; in Sardinian) is usually found, which symbolizes the gods or ancestors who watched over the dead.

The so-called &quot;block type&quot; tombs are made of rectangular-cut blocks (Bidistili, Madau II, Seleni II, Iloi, Mura Cuata).

There are also structures similar to the block-type giants tombs on the island of Malta, in the United Kingdom and in Menorca (naveta).

<doc id="663779" wikidata="Q4355869" url="?curid=663779" title="Amelia Boynton Robinson">
<text>Amelia Isadora Platts Boynton Robinson (August 18, 1905 – August 26, 2015) was an American activist and supercentenarian who was a leader of the American Civil Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama, and a key figure in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.

In 1984, she became founding vice-president of the Schiller Institute, which was affiliated with Lyndon LaRouche, a far-right activist. She was awarded the Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Medal in 1990.

==Early life==
Amelia Isadora Platts was born in Savannah, Georgia, to George and Anna Eliza (née Hicks) Platts, both of whom were African-American. She also had Cherokee and German ancestry. Church was central to Amelia and her nine siblings&#x27; upbringing. As a young girl, she became involved in campaigning for women&#x27;s suffrage. Her family encouraged the children to read. Amelia attended two years at Georgia State Industrial College for Colored Youth (now Savannah State University, a historically black college). She transferred to Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), earning a degree in home economics in 1927. (Platts later also studied at Tennessee State, Virginia State, and Temple University.)

==Career and civil rights==
Platts taught in Georgia before starting with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in Selma as the home demonstration agent for Dallas County. She educated the county&#x27;s largely rural population about food production and processing, nutrition, healthcare, and other subjects related to agriculture and homemaking.

She met her future husband, Samuel William Boynton, in Selma, where he was working as a county extension agent during the Great Depression. They married in 1936 and had two sons, Bill Jr. and Bruce Carver Boynton. Her son, Bruce Carver Boynton, was the godson and namesake of George Washington Carver. Later they adopted Amelia&#x27;s two nieces Sharon (Platts) Seay and Germaine (Platts) Bowser. Amelia and Samuel had known the noted scholar George Washington Carver at the Tuskegee Institute, from which they both graduated.

In 1934, Amelia Boynton registered to vote, which was extremely difficult for African Americans to accomplish in Alabama, due to discriminatory practices under the state&#x27;s disenfranchising constitution passed at the turn of the century. It had effectively excluded most blacks from politics for decades, an exclusion that continued into the 1960s. A few years later she wrote a play, &quot;Through the Years&quot;, which told the story of the creation of Spiritual music and a former slave who was elected to Congress during Reconstruction, based on her father&#x27;s half-brother Robert Smalls, in order to help fund a community center in Selma, Alabama. In 1954, the Boyntons met Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., and his wife, Coretta Scott King at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King was the pastor.

In 1958, her son, Bruce Boynton, was a student at Howard University School of Law when he was arrested while attempting to purchase food at the white section of a bus terminal in Richmond, Virginia. Arrested for trespassing, Bruce Boynton was found guilty in state court of a misdemeanor and fined, which he appealed and lost until the case, Boynton v. Virginia, was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court by Thurgood Marshall, reversing lower court decisions.

In 1963, Samuel Boynton died. It was a time of increased activism in the Civil Rights Movement. Amelia made her home and office in Selma a center for strategy sessions for Selma&#x27;s civil rights battles, including its voting rights campaign. In 1964, Boynton ran for the Congress from Alabama, hoping to encourage black registration and voting. She was the first female African American to run for office in Alabama and the first woman of any race to run for the ticket of the Democratic Party in the state. She received 10% of the vote. She was also part of the steering committee of the Dallas County Voters League, becoming part of the &quot;courageous eight&quot;.

In late 1964 and early 1965, Boynton worked with Martin Luther King Jr., Diane Nash, James Bevel, and others of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to plan demonstrations for civil and voting rights. While Selma had a population that was 50 percent black, only 300 of the town&#x27;s African-American residents were registered as voters in 1965, after thousands had been arrested in protests. By March 1966, after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 11,000 were registered to vote.

To protest continuing segregation and disenfranchisement of blacks, in early 1965 Amelia Boynton helped organize a march to the state capital of Montgomery, initiated by James Bevel, which took place on March 7, 1965. Led by John Lewis, Hosea Williams and Bob Mants, and including Rosa Parks and others among the marchers, the event became known as Bloody Sunday when county and state police stopped the march and beat demonstrators after they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge into Dallas County. Boynton was beaten unconscious; a photograph of her lying on Edmund Pettus Bridge went around the world.

Boynton suffered throat burns from the effects of tear gas. She participated in both of the subsequent marches. Another short march led by Martin Luther King Jr. took place two days later; the marchers turned back after crossing the Pettus Bridge. Finally, with federal protection and thousands of marchers joining them, a third march reached Montgomery on March 24, entering with 25,000 people.

The events of Bloody Sunday and the later march on Montgomery galvanized national public opinion and contributed to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; Boynton was a guest of honor at the ceremony when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law in August of that year.

==Later life==
Boynton remarried in 1969, to a musician named Bob W. Billups. He died unexpectedly in a boating accident in 1973. Amelia Boynton eventually married a third time, to former Tuskegee classmate James Robinson in 1976. She moved with him to his home in Tuskegee after the wedding. James Robinson died in 1988.

In 1983, Robinson met Lyndon LaRouche, considered a highly controversial political figure in the Democratic Party. A year later she served as a founding board member of the LaRouche-affiliated Schiller Institute. LaRouche was later convicted in 1988 of mail fraud involving twelve counts, over a ten-year period, totaling $280,000. In 1991, the Schiller Institute published a biography of Robinson, who even into her 90s was described as &quot;LaRouche&#x27;s most high-profile Black spokeswoman.&quot;

In 1992, proclamations of &quot;Amelia Boynton Robinson Day&quot; in Seattle and in the state of Washington were rescinded when officials learned of Robinson&#x27;s involvement in the Schiller Institute. It was the first time the state had pulled back such an honor. A spokesman for the Seattle mayor said,

Robinson said in an interview,

According to the Associated Press, she said that people got the wrong image of LaRouche because government leaders were spreading lies about him.&quot;

In 2004, Robinson sued The Walt Disney Company for defamation, asking for between $1 and $10 million in damages. She contended that the 1999 TV movie &quot;Selma, Lord, Selma&quot;, a docudrama based on a book written by two young participants in Bloody Sunday, falsely depicted her as a stereotypical &quot;black Mammy,&quot; whose key role was to &quot;make religious utterances and to participate in singing spirituals and protest songs.&quot; She lost the case.

In June 2007, Robinson attended the funeral of former Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark, who had once beaten and arrested her in 1965 during the Selma to Montgomery marches. When asked about her lack of hatred for a person who had committed egregious acts against her and fellow protestors, Robinson explained that:

From September to mid-November 2007, Robinson toured Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy in her capacity as Vice President of the Schiller Institute. She spoke with European youth about her support for LaRouche (who had denied facts about the 9/11 attacks), Martin Luther King Jr., and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as well as the continuing problem of racism in the United States, which she said was illustrated by the recent events in Jena, Louisiana.

Robinson retired as vice president of the Schiller Institute in 2009.

In February 2011, at the claimed age of 99, Robinson returned to her hometown of Savannah, to address students at Savannah State University.

After suffering a series of strokes, Robinson died on August 26, 2015, in Montgomery, Alabama. All the reports at the time of her death gave her age as 104, but a later report revealed that she was 110 at the time of her death. This age was later verified by the Gerontology Research Group. Her body was cremated and her ashes were scattered over the Alabama River.

==Legacy and awards==
In 1990, Boynton (by then remarried and using the surname of Robinson) was awarded the Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Medal. Her memoir, &quot;Bridge Across Jordan,&quot; includes tributes from friends and colleagues, including Coretta Scott King and Andrew Young.
King wrote:
In 2014, the Selma City Council renamed five blocks of Lapsley Street as Boyntons Street to honor Amelia Boynton Robinson and Sam Boynton.

Robinson is played by Lorraine Toussaint in the 2014 film &quot;Selma&quot;, about the Selma Voting Rights Movement and its Selma to Montgomery marches. Robinson, then 109 years old, was unable to travel to see the film. Paramount Pictures set up a private screening in her home to include her friends and family. A CNN reporter was present to discuss the film and her experiences at Selma, and she said she felt the film was fantastic.

In 2015, Robinson attended the State of the Union Address in January at the invitation of President Barack Obama, and, in her wheelchair, was at Obama&#x27;s side as he and others walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge during the Selma Voting Rights Movement 50th Anniversary Jubilee that March.

<doc id="663780" wikidata="Q2102021" url="?curid=663780" title="Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll">
<text>Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll (c. 1575–1638), also called (&quot;Archibald the Grim&quot;), was a Scottish peer, politician, and military leader.

==Life==
Campbell was the son of Colin Campbell, 6th Earl of Argyll and Agnes Keith.

His nickname, , is the Gaelic for &quot;Archibald the Grim&quot;. This may originate from his first wife, Agnes Douglas, whose 14th-century ancestor, Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas was so called.

On 15 July 1594 James VI gave him a commission to wage war with &quot;fire and sword&quot; against the Catholic Earls of Huntly and Erroll. He commanded royal troops at the Battle of Glenlivet on 3 October 1594 and was defeated by the rebel earls and their followers.

After the Union of Crowns, Argyll accompanied Anne of Denmark on her journey south to Windsor Castle in June 1603. On the way he quarrelled with the Earl of Sussex. At Worksop Manor, the Duke of Lennox and the Earls of Shrewsbury and Cumberland made a proclamation at that her followers should put aside any private quarrels.

In January 1610 he argued over the precedency of seating of his wife, Anne Cornwallis, with the Earl of Pembroke, at a dinner hosted by Lady Hatton. King James commanded Argyll to yield place to Pembroke until Parliament decided their issue.

By 1619, he had surrendered his estates to his son, Archibald Campbell. He was made a Knight of the Golden Fleece in 1624. He had announced his conversion to Catholicism from the Netherlands and as a consequence he was declared a traitor in Edinburgh on 16 February 1619 and banned from his country. He was very supportive of his new religion even after he was allowed back in 1621. He was interested in military solutions in Ireland in 1622, but he was unable to raise an army. He and his wife returned to Britain and lived at Drury Lane in London having abandoned everything apart from his title to his heir. In 1636, the Earl was indicted for recusancy.

He died in 1638 and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

==Family==
On 24 July 1592, he married his first wife, Lady Agnes Douglas, youngest daughter of the Earl of Morton at Dalkeith Palace. Some &quot;very great personages&quot; had tried to persuade Argyll to marry Marie Stewart sister of the king&#x27;s favourite, the Duke of Lennox. On the day after their wedding Argyll rode at speed to Falkland Palace to help James VI who was threatened by the Earl of Bothwell.

Argyll and Agnes Douglas had at least five children, including:
* Annabel Campbell (d. 1652), who married Robert Kerr, 2nd Earl of Lothian
* Anne Campbell (d. 1638), who married George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly
* Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll (1607-1661), who married Margaret Douglas (1610–1678)
* Jane Campbell (? - 1675) became Viscountess Kenmure

After the death of his first wife in 1607 or 1608, Argyll considered marrying Jean Drummond, a lady in waiting to Anne of Denmark. Instead, in 1608 he married Anne (Cornwallis), with whom he had at least four more children. Her sister Cornelia, the wife of Sir Richard Fermor, accidentally shot a young lawyer with a pocket pistol in April 1617. The Earl of Argyll bailed her from the Marshalsea Prison.

In 1618 Archibald Campbell converted to Roman Catholicism, the religion of his new wife, from Presbyterianism. She was at Spa in Belgium in August 1618 and travelled on to Brussels in her coach.

<text>Bruce David Grobbelaar (born 6 October 1957) is a Zimbabwean former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper, most prominently for English team Liverpool between 1981 and 1994, and for the Zimbabwean national team. He is remembered for his gymnastic-like athletic ability, unflappable confidence and eccentric and flamboyant style of play, as well as his rushing ability, which has led pundits to compare him retrospectively to the sweeper-keepers of the modern era.

Born in South Africa, Grobbelaar grew up in neighbouring Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), and served in the Rhodesian Army before he joined the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League in 1979. He gained Liverpool&#x27;s attention during a loan spell at Crewe Alexandra during the 1979–80 season, and signed for the Merseyside club in 1981. Making 628 appearances for Liverpool over the next 13 years, including 440 in the League, he won the League championship with the club six times, as well as three FA Cups, three League Cups and the 1983–84 European Cup.

Grobbelaar left Liverpool for Southampton in 1994, transferred to Plymouth Argyle two years later, and thereafter played for an assortment of English lower-league teams, never for more than a few games. He was appointed as goalkeeper coach for Ottawa Fury FC of the North American Soccer League in 2014. In March 2018 he was announced as goalkeeper coach for the Matabeleland football team.

==Club career==
===Early years===
In his teenage years, Grobbelaar was a talented cricketer and was offered a baseball scholarship in the United States, but a career in football was his main ambition. He attended David Livingstone Primary School in Harare before moving onto Hamilton High School (Bulawayo). His footballing career started with a Bulawayo-based team, Highlanders FC, in Rhodesia&#x27;s second biggest city. In his late teens he was signed up by Durban City Football Club in South Africa, but left claiming to have been sidelined owing to his colour in a predominantly black team — the team had played in an all-white league until the previous year. Immediately after leaving Highlands Park, he was conscripted into National Service, spending eleven months on active service in the Rhodesia Regiment during the Rhodesian Bush War.

===Vancouver Whitecaps===
In 1979, Grobbelaar was signed by the Vancouver Whitecaps of the NASL after he had attended their scouting camp in South Africa. At the Vancouver Whitecaps, Grobbelaar played under the management of former England and Blackpool goalkeeper, Tony Waiters, making his debut on 4 August 1979 against the Los Angeles Aztecs away. The Whitecaps lost 0–2, Johan Cruyff scoring one of the Aztecs&#x27; goals. Grobbelaar spent the rest of the season as second choice to former Wolverhampton Wanderers keeper Phil Parkes.

During 1979, he visited England to see family friends, and a chance phone call from Ron Atkinson, brought him an impromptu trial with West Bromwich Albion. Atkinson was keen to sign Grobbelaar but owing to difficulties over gaining a work permit, the deal fell through. In stepped Crewe Alexandra, signing Grobbelaar on loan on 18 December 1979. In an early League appearance for the Railwaymen in the Fourth Division, the unknown Grobbelaar was named on the team sheet in the York City matchday programme as &quot;Bill Grobbelaar&quot;. During his time at Crewe, Grobbelaar played 24 League games and scored his only professional goal, a penalty, in his last game. By good fortune, on the evening when he gave his greatest performance for Crewe, he was spotted by Liverpool&#x27;s head scout Tom Saunders.

At the end of the loan period, Grobbelaar returned to Vancouver for the 1980 NASL season.

===Liverpool===

By the time Liverpool had completed their research on Grobbelaar, he had returned to Vancouver with his loan spell now over. Liverpool approached Tony Waiters with the idea of taking Grobbelaar to Anfield, and Waiters, who had a working relationship with Liverpool in the 1970s, paved the way for the move. Grobbelaar signed for Liverpool for £250,000 on 17 March 1981 as their reserve goalkeeper, but in mid-1981, regular goalkeeper Ray Clemence&#x27;s departure to Tottenham Hotspur gave Grobbelaar his opportunity.

Grobbelaar made his debut on 28 August 1981 but failed to prevent Wolverhampton Wanderers winning the league fixture 1–0 at Molineux. Also making their debuts were defender Mark Lawrenson and midfielder Craig Johnston. His first clean sheet came a fortnight later at Anfield on 5 September, Arsenal were the visitors who were beaten by a 2–0 scoreline.

Grobbelaar&#x27;s early days as No.1 were strewn with errors and the Reds struggled to obtain any sort of consistency, Grobbelaar taking a lot of the blame. By the end of the calendar year Liverpool were mid table in the league and looked to be out of the running for title honours, especially as they had just lost to Manchester City 3–1 at Anfield in the Boxing Day fixture – a defeat which put John Bond&#x27;s team top of the league. The New Year brought a new momentum as Bob Paisley began to get the best out of his players; they began the year in South Wales visiting the Vetch Field to play Swansea City in the FA Cup, Liverpool were in fine form and thumped their hosts 4–0. This set them on their way in the league and dropped just seven of the 50 available points, overhauling the points gap that Ipswich Town had opened on them.

Grobbelaar added the championship medal to the League Cup winners medal he had gained at Wembley on 13 March; the Reds beat Spurs 3–1, who had Ray Clemence in goal.

During the period 1981–1994, Grobbelaar played 627 first team games for Liverpool, becoming known for his eccentric and flamboyant style. In 1984, the European Cup final between Liverpool and Roma finished 1–1 after extra time and went to a penalty shootout. As Roma&#x27;s Bruno Conti prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite the back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before Francesco Graziani took his kick, wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani missed and Liverpool went on to win the shootout 4–2.

Grobbelaar was retained by three of Liverpool&#x27;s greatest managers; Paisley, Fagan and Dalglish, over a period of 13 years. His strengths were his gymnastic-like agility, and an unflappable confidence. He was never afraid to be seen to berate his defenders if he thought they had given easy opportunities to the opposition, such as in his verbal assault on Jim Beglin in the first all Merseyside FA Cup final against Everton in 1986. Over the course of his Liverpool career he won more medals than any of his contemporaries.

In 1984–85, Grobbelaar brought down a spectator who had invaded the pitch during a game, allowing the police to handcuff the offending spectator.

Although there were occasional challenges to his position as Liverpool&#x27;s number 1, Grobbelaar was a virtual ever-present from Clemence&#x27;s departure to the start of the 1990s which coincided with the end of the club&#x27;s dominance. He was an ever-present in his first five league campaigns at Anfield, when Liverpool were champions four times and runners-up on the other occasion. However, in 1988–89, injuries and illness restricted his first team opportunities and he played 21 times in the league, with Mike Hooper taking his place on the other 17 occasions. However, he was fit to face Everton in the 3–2 FA Cup win on 20 May 1989, though six days later he conceded a last minute goal to Arsenal midfielder Michael Thomas on the final day of the league season as the league title was wrenched from Liverpool&#x27;s grasp and headed to Highbury instead. A month earlier, he played in the FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest which was played at Old Trafford after the original match at Hillsborough was cancelled due to the tragedy that led to 97 fans dying on the terracing behind Grobbelaar&#x27;s goal. Grobbelaar attended many of the victims&#x27; funerals.

It was the signing of David James from Watford in mid-1992 that spelt the beginning of the end for Grobbelaar. Although James struggled to impress at first, Grobbelaar&#x27;s insistence on playing for Zimbabwe gave James chances; Grobbelaar only played six times for Liverpool during 1992–93 and spent a short period on loan at Second Division side Stoke City where he made four appearances. James&#x27;s uncertainty allowed Grobbelaar to regain his place in the first team at the start of the 1993–94 season, in which his performance, like the team&#x27;s, started well but fell away badly. In a notorious incident in a Merseyside derby that year, Grobbelaar even physically assaulted young teammate Steve McManaman. He was ever-present until he was injured in the final minute of a 2–0 defeat at Leeds United on 19 February 1994. It turned out to be his final appearance for the club.

In 14 years at the club, he had won six league title medals, three FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal, three Football League Cup winner&#x27;s medals and a European Cup winner&#x27;s medal.

===Southampton===
Grobbelaar left Liverpool in mid-1994, transferring on a free transfer to Southampton. He made his debut on 20 August 1994 in the 1–1 league draw with Blackburn Rovers at The Dell. He spent two seasons with the Saints competing with another goalkeeper with a reputation for eccentricity, Dave Beasant. Despite the fuss caused by the match-fixing allegations (see below), manager Alan Ball maintained faith in him, and he kept his place in the team for most of the 1994–95 season.

Allegations that Grobbelar had been match-fixing first appeared in November 1994. Nevertheless, in his next game, at home to Arsenal, he managed to keep a clean sheet despite the media frenzy that surrounded the game. The &quot;Southern Daily Echo&quot; reported that Grobbelaar was &quot;swept along on a tidal wave of emotion, to emerge triumphant from the toughest match of his life&quot;.

In the 1995–96 season, Grobbelaar only managed two games for the Saints, before moving on to Plymouth Argyle.

===After Southampton===
Grobbelaar spent the 1996–97 season with Plymouth, after which he spent short spells at Oxford United, Sheffield Wednesday, Oldham Athletic, Chesham United, Bury, Lincoln City and Northwich Victoria over the next two years before returning to his native country.

==International career==
Grobbelaar was born in Durban, South Africa to ethnic Afrikaner parents. When he was two months old, he emigrated to Rhodesia with his mother and sister to join his father, who had got a job on the railways there.

Grobbelaar grew up and learnt his football in Rhodesia. He made his international debut for Rhodesia as a 19-year-old in a friendly versus South Africa in 1977. Grobbelaar played for Zimbabwe in both of their 1982 World Cup qualifying matches versus Cameroon. He also appeared for his country in a qualifying match for the 1986 World Cup versus Egypt.

In 1992, he returned to the national team after an absence of several years. With a team including Grobbelaar and Adam and Peter Ndlovu, Zimbabwe came just a victory short of qualification for the 1994 World Cup under the guidance of manager Reinhard Fabisch. Grobbelaar earned 32 caps for Zimbabwe between 1980 and 1998.

On 7 June 2018, Grobbelaar played a one-off game for Matabeleland in the ConIFA World Cup against the Chagos Islands, playing 30 minutes.

==Match-fixing allegations==
On 10 November 1994, Grobbelaar was accused by the British tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; of match fixing during his time at Liverpool to benefit a betting syndicate, after being caught on videotape discussing match-fixing. He was charged with conspiracy to corrupt, along with the Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers and Aston Villa striker John Fashanu (only recently signed from Wimbledon), and a Malaysian businessman, Heng Suan Lim.

Despite these allegations, Grobbelaar and Segers were allowed to continue playing, while Fashanu retired from playing less than a year after being charged. Grobbelaar pleaded not guilty, claiming he was only gathering evidence with the intent of taking it to the police. After two successive trials, in both of which the jury could not agree on a verdict, he and his co-defendants were cleared in November 1997. Grobbelaar later sued &quot;The Sun&quot; for libel and was awarded £85,000. &quot;The Sun&quot; appealed, and the case was eventually taken to the House of Lords where it was found that, though the specific allegations had not been proved, there was adequate evidence of dishonesty. The Lords slashed his award to £1, the lowest libel damages possible under English law, and ordered him to pay &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s legal costs, estimated at £500,000. In his judgement, Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed:

Grobbelaar was unable to pay the costs and was declared bankrupt. He and Segers did not retire from playing until some time after being cleared of their involvement in the alleged match fixing.

==Retirement and coaching==
Grobbelaar moved back to South Africa, his place of birth, where he coached a number of teams with various degrees of success. He managed Seven Stars in 1999 and took the team from the relegation zone to finish fourth in the final league table. In 2001, he took over struggling Hellenic. While at the club, he saved them from relegation, and played in their last match of the season, against Kaizer Chiefs, starting the game, and substituting himself after 20 minutes after cracking his ribs. He was the oldest player ever to have played in the South African league, at 44 years old, until his record was beaten in 2013 by fellow keeper Andre Arendse. He also spent time coaching Supersport United, Manning Rangers (2004) and Umtata Bush Bucks (2004), as well as in Zimbabwe, where he was twice briefly player-manager of Zimbabwe&#x27;s national team in 1997 and 1998.

Grobbelaar briefly returned to the United Kingdom to help coach a number of clubs. Grobbelaar has previously stated that he &quot;hopes to one day return to Anfield as the manager of Liverpool FC.&quot;

Grobbelaar returned to England in 2006 to play in a replay of the 1986 FA Cup final against Everton for the Marina Dalglish Appeal, a charity for Cancer research set up by former team-mate and manager Kenny Dalglish and his wife, Marina, a cancer survivor. Liverpool won the match 1–0.

Grobbelaar played in Sky One&#x27;s &quot;The Match&quot; in 2004 and &quot;The Match 3&quot; in 2006, keeping a clean sheet in both games.

Grobbelaar, also known as &quot;Brucie&quot;, is still a firm favourite amongst the Anfield faithful, and was voted as No.17 in a poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop conducted in mid-2006 by the official Liverpool Football Club website. Over 110,000 worldwide voted for their best ten players in the Anfield club&#x27;s history, with Grobbelaar finishing 2nd in the goalkeeping stakes.

In March 2007, Liverpool&#x27;s official website announced that Grobbelaar would come out of retirement for a one-off game and play for non-league Castleford side Glasshoughton Welfare to help them in their fight for survival. He played against Maltby Main on 14 April 2007, helping Glasshoughton to a 2–1 win.

On a 16 April 2009 episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, Grobbelaar wore a black armband on his left arm in remembrance of the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. On 22 April, he left the show citing a need to be reunited with his wife.

He was persuaded to play for Winterbourne United in their Gloucestershire FA Trophy game against Patchway Town on 5 December 2009 but in the end did not make an appearance. Winterbourne at that time were managed by Nicky Tanner, who was a teammate of Grobbelaar at Liverpool.

During the World Cup 2010 in South Africa, he appeared on Norwegian TV-channel TV 2.

As of 2012, Grobbelaar resided in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada, where he was active in the local soccer scene, playing keeper for Corner Brook Men&#x27;s Soccer League team West Side Monarchs, and occasionally lending his expertise to the Corner Brook Minor Soccer Association as a coach.

From July 2014 to January 2018, he was the goalkeeping coach for Ottawa Fury FC of the North American Soccer League and subsequently the United Soccer League.

In May 2018, he became goalkeeping coach for the Matabeleland football team, and on 1 June it was announced that he would join the playing roster for their remaining group games. It was subsequently announced by head coach Justin Walley that he would start in goal against Chagos Islands on 7 June 2018. He later became the goalkeeping coach with Norwegian club Øygarden FK.

<text>In crystallography, a crystallographic point group is a three dimensional point group whose symmetry operations are compatible with a three dimensional crystallographic lattice. According to the crystallographic restriction it may only contain one-, two-, three-, four- and sixfold rotations or rotoinversions. This reduces the number of crystallographic point groups to 32 (from an infinity of general point groups). These 32 groups are one-and-the-same as the 32 types of morphological (external) crystalline symmetries derived in 1830 by Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel from a consideration of observed crystal forms. In 1867 Axel Gadolin, who was unaware of the previous work of Hessel, found the crystallographic point groups independently using stereographic projection to represent the symmetry elements of the 32 groups.

In the classification of crystals, to each space group is associated a crystallographic point group by &quot;forgetting&quot; the translational components of the symmetry operations. That is, by turning screw rotations into rotations, glide reflections into reflections and moving all symmetry elements into the origin. Each crystallographic point group defines the (geometric) crystal class of the crystal.

The point group of a crystal determines, among other things, the directional variation of physical properties that arise from its structure, including optical properties such as birefringency, or electro-optical features such as the Pockels effect.

==Notation==

The point groups are named according to their component symmetries. There are several standard notations used by crystallographers, mineralogists, and physicists.

For the correspondence of the two systems below, see crystal system.

===Schoenflies notation===

In Schoenflies notation, point groups are denoted by a letter symbol with a subscript. The symbols used in crystallography mean the following:

*&quot;Cn&quot; (for cyclic) indicates that the group has an &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation axis. &quot;Cnh&quot; is &quot;Cn&quot; with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. &quot;Cnv&quot; is &quot;Cn&quot; with the addition of n mirror planes parallel to the axis of rotation.
*&quot;S2n&quot; (for &quot;Spiegel&quot;, German for mirror) denotes a group with only a &quot;2n&quot;-fold rotation-reflection axis.
*&quot;Dn&quot; (for dihedral, or two-sided) indicates that the group has an &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation axis plus &quot;n&quot; twofold axes perpendicular to that axis. &quot;Dnh&quot; has, in addition, a mirror plane perpendicular to the &quot;n&quot;-fold axis. &quot;Dnd&quot; has, in addition to the elements of &quot;Dn&quot;, mirror planes parallel to the &quot;n&quot;-fold axis.
*The letter &quot;T&quot; (for tetrahedron) indicates that the group has the symmetry of a tetrahedron. &quot;Td&quot; includes improper rotation operations, &quot;T&quot; excludes improper rotation operations, and &quot;Th&quot; is &quot;T&quot; with the addition of an inversion.
*The letter &quot;O&quot; (for octahedron) indicates that the group has the symmetry of an octahedron, with (&quot;Oh&quot;) or without (&quot;O&quot;) improper operations (those that change handedness).

Due to the crystallographic restriction theorem, &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 in 2- or 3-dimensional space.
&quot;D4d&quot; and &quot;D6d&quot; are actually forbidden because they contain improper rotations with n=8 and 12 respectively. The 27 point groups in the table plus &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Td&quot;, &quot;Th&quot;, &quot;O&quot; and &quot;Oh&quot; constitute 32 crystallographic point groups.

=== Hermann–Mauguin notation===
An abbreviated form of the Hermann–Mauguin notation commonly used for space groups also serves to describe crystallographic point groups. Group names are

===The correspondence between different notations===

== Isomorphisms ==
Many of the crystallographic point groups share the same internal structure. For example, the point groups , 2, and m contain different geometric symmetry operations, (inversion, rotation, and reflection, respectively) but all share the structure of the cyclic group C2. All isomorphic groups are of the same order, but not all groups of the same order are isomorphic. The point groups which are isomorphic are shown in the following table:

This table makes use of cyclic groups (C1, C2, C3, C4, C6), dihedral groups (D2, D3, D4, D6), one of the alternating groups (A4), and one of the symmetric groups (S4). Here the symbol &quot; × &quot; indicates a direct product.

==Deriving the crystallographic point group (crystal class) from the space group==

# Leave out the Bravais lattice type.
# Convert all symmetry elements with translational components into their respective symmetry elements without translation symmetry. (Glide planes are converted into simple mirror planes; screw axes are converted into simple axes of rotation.)
# Axes of rotation, rotoinversion axes, and mirror planes remain unchanged.

<text>HMS &quot;Java was a British [[Royal Navy]] 38-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[Sailing frigate|frigate]]. She was originally laid down in 1805 as Renommée&quot;, described as a 40-gun French Navy frigate, but the vessel actually carried 46 guns. The British captured her in 1811 in a noteworthy action during the Battle of Tamatave, but she is most famous for her defeat on 29 December 1812 in a three-hour single-ship action against . &quot;Java&quot; had a complement of about 277, but during her engagement with &quot;Constitution&quot; she allegedly had 426 aboard, in comparison with her opponent&#x27;s 475.

==French service==
In May 1811, she was part of a three-sail squadron under François Roquebert, comprising &quot;Renommée&quot;, and &quot;Néréide&quot;, and ferrying troops to Mauritius. On 20 May, the French encountered a British squadron comprising , , , and . In the ensuing Battle of Tamatave, &quot;Renommée&quot; struck after her mainsail was set on fire. The British captured &quot;Néréide&quot; five days later at Tamatave, Madagascar. &quot;Clorinde&quot;, commanded by Jacques de Saint-Cricq, escaped. The British brought &quot;Renommée&quot; into service as &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;Néréide&quot; as .

==Royal Navy service==
In July &quot;Java&quot; was under Captain William Gordon, but not commissioned until August under Captain Henry Lambert, a senior commander who had seen combat on a number of occasions in His Majesty&#x27;s service.

&quot;Java&quot; sailed from Portsmouth on 12 November for Bombay to deliver the appointed governor, Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Hislop, and his staff with their baggage, and naval stores (including copper plates for the under-construction , at Bombay, and plans for the new ship, ). She was carrying additional personnel for other ships at the time and included another Royal Navy commander in transit.

===Capture by USS &quot;Constitution&quot;===

Captain Lambert of &quot;Java&quot; was a well-qualified officer, having seen much combat during his service. &quot;Java&quot; had more than a full crew, having been rounded out while in Portsmouth, but many were landsmen still raw to service at sea, and even more damning to her cause, they had only practised gunnery once without shot loaded in the guns. Still, &quot;Java&quot; was well supplied and manned, and would prove to be well handled and well fought. had an experienced crew manning a heavy frigate carrying 54 cannon: thirty 24-pounder guns and twenty-four 32-pounder carronades, plus two 24-pounder bow chasers.

On 13 December 1812, sailing from Boston by way of Cape Verde, USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, under the command of Captain William Bainbridge, accompanied by , commanded by James Lawrence, arrived off the coast of Brazil at St. Salvador. On 26 December &quot;Hornet&quot; was sent into the port to communicate with the American consul stationed there. On 29 December at 9:00 a.m., still out at high sea in search of prizes, crewmen aloft &quot;Constitution&quot; sighted strange sails on the distant horizon. Bainbridge initially was unsure of the disposition of the ships, but hours later as they drew closer he was able to discern that the approaching vessels were large and now assumed them to be British. To ascertain the disposition of the unidentified ships &quot;Constitution&quot; hoisted private signals (flags) at 11:30 a.m., while the assumed British vessel also hoisted its signals, but neither ship made the correct counter-signal.

&quot;Constitution&quot;, tacking the wind, made her way from the neutral Portuguese territorial waters with &quot;Java&quot; giving chase. At 12:30 p.m. that day &quot;Java&quot; hoisted her colors and ensign with &quot;Constitution&quot; hoisting her colors in reply. With the dispositions of each ship confirmed, &quot;Java&quot;, with the weather gauge to her advantage, came about to position herself to rake &quot;Constitution&quot;. Being French-built, she was comparatively light for a frigate and was consequently faster and more maneuverable than &quot;Constitution&quot;. In reply &quot;Constitution&quot; fired a shot across &quot;Java&quot;″s bow with &quot;Java&quot; returning fire with a full broadside.

&quot;Java&quot; started the battle badly out-matched both in terms of the experience of her crew and the weight of her broadside. &quot;Constitution&quot;, with her experienced commander and crew, countered by not shortening sail as was standard (this reduced strain on the masts, thus making it less likely to lose a mast under fire). By 2:00 p.m., both ships were heading southeast. The opening phase of the action comprised both ships turning to and fro, attempting to get the better position for which to fire upon and rake the other, but with little success. Bainbridge now wore &quot;Constitution&quot; to a matching course and opened fire with a broadside at half a mile. This broadside accomplished nothing and forced Bainbridge to risk raking to close &quot;Java&quot;. Another broadside from &quot;Java&quot; carried away &quot;Constitution&quot;″s helm, disabling her rudder and leaving Bainbridge severely wounded; however he still maintained command, refusing to sit out the battle. Both ships resumed firing broadsides but by now &quot;Java&quot; had a mast and sail falling over her starboard side that prevented most of her guns on that side from firing, which also prevented her from laying alongside &quot;Constitution&quot;. The guns that attempted to fire only managed to set the fallen sail and rigging ablaze.
&quot;Constitution&quot;″s accuracy of fire and the greater weight of her broadside put the much smaller &quot;Java&quot; at a large disadvantage. Within one hour, after several close encounters involving the rigging of each ship getting entangled with the other&#x27;s, &quot;Java&quot;″s masts collapsed. During this encounter a sharpshooter aloft in &quot;Constitution&quot; mortally wounded Lambert. Lieutenant Henry Ducie Chads now took over command, assisted by the captain in transit to his ship. Bainbridge used this opportunity to distance &quot;Constitution&quot; so as to make immediately-needed repairs, taking approximately an hour. Clearing the masts and fallen rigging aboard &quot;Java&quot; had hardly begun when &quot;Constitution&quot; returned from repairing her damage and immediately took a raking position from which &quot;Java&quot; could not defend herself. This left Lieutenant Chads no choice but to surrender &quot;Java&quot;. &quot;Constitution&quot; hoisted out a boat and sent First Lieutenant Parker to take possession of the prize.

In the battle, &quot;Java&quot; suffered 22 men killed, including Lambert, and 102 wounded. &quot;Constitution&quot; lost nine men initially and 57 wounded, including Bainbridge. Some four or five later succumbed to their wounds.

In the course of battle &quot;Java&quot; was rendered a dismasted hulk that was not worth taking as a prize. Instead Bainbridge removed her helm and installed it on &quot;Constitution&quot;, replacing the one that had been shot away. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1813, two days after the engagement, Bainbridge gave the order to set &quot;Java&quot; ablaze; she subsequently blew up.

Upon learning of the death of Captain Lambert, Commodore Bainbridge expressed deep sorrow for a commander he credited to be brave and noble. On 23 April 1813, Lieutenant Chads and the other surviving officers and men of &quot;Java&quot; faced the customary court martial aboard for the loss of their ship. They were honourably acquitted.

==In fiction==
The engagement between &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;Constitution&quot; was fictionalized in the novel &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; by Patrick O&#x27;Brian and in the novel &quot;Yankee Mission&quot; by Julian Stockwin.

<text>Domus de Janas (Sardinian for &#x27;House of the Fairies&#x27; or, alternatively, &#x27;House of Witches&#x27;) are a type of pre-Nuragic rock-cut chamber tomb found in Sardinia. They consist of several chambers quarried out by the people of the San Ciriaco through Ozieri cultures and subsequent cultures, resembling houses in their layout.

Built mostly between 3400 and 2700 BC, they date to the late Neolithic, Chalcolithic and early Bronze Age, including the Bell Beaker period. A necropolis of them at the site of Anghelu Ruju, near Alghero, consists of 38 tombs. Other large sites are those of &quot;Montessu&quot;, near Villaperuccio, and of &quot;Sant&#x27;Andrea Priu&quot; at Bonorva. Many other domus de janas can be found throughout the island, with the exception of Gallura (where the deceased were usually buried in megalithic circles, such as that those of Li Muri).

The shape of the internal chambers can vary from that of a rounded hut with conical or triangular ceiling. The walls are often decorated with reliefs or etchings depicting magical and religious symbols such as spirals, zig-zag motifs and bull&#x27;s horns.

Carved or painted false doors appear in about 20 tombs mostly located in northwestern Sardinia, an example being some of the tombs of the necropolis of Anghelu Ruju, which are variously datable from the Ozieri to the Bonnanaro cultures (c.3200 – 1600 BCE). The earliest examples predate the appearance of false doors in Ancient Egyptian tombs. These false doors usually appear on the back wall of the main chamber, and are represented by horizontal and vertical frames and a projecting lintel. Sometimes the door is topped with painted or carved U-shaped bull horns, inscribed inside each other in a variable number.

The corpses, painted with red ochre like the tomb&#x27;s walls, were buried together with common life objects, jewels and tools. According to archaeologist Giovanni Lilliu, they were buried under shells of molluscs; according to other theories, they were left outside the tomb, being put inside only after they had reduced to a skeleton.

<text>Marjorie June Taylor (December 14, 1917 – May 16, 2004) was an American choreographer, best known as the founder of the June Taylor Dancers, who were featured on Jackie Gleason&#x27;s various television variety programs.

==Early life and career==
Taylor was born in Chicago, the daughter of Percival Guy Taylor and Angela Taylor. She started taking dance lessons at age eight; by age 14, she lied about her age and became one of the dancers at the Chicago nightclub, Chez Paree. At age 19, she was touring the US and Europe as a dancer in various nightclubs. She returned from London and began performing again in Chicago. In 1938, at age 21, Taylor collapsed on stage, ill with tuberculosis; she spent the next two years in a sanitarium, after which she turned to choreography, founding her own dance troupe in 1942, which made its first professional appearance at Chicago&#x27;s Blackhawk restaurant.

In 1946, Taylor met Jackie Gleason at a Baltimore nightclub. The two became friends when Taylor helped Gleason overcome a case of stage fright. In 1948, Taylor made her television debut on &quot;The Toast of the Town&quot; starring Ed Sullivan, where six of her original dancers appeared as The Toastettes, bringing the chorus line to television. Two years later, Taylor joined Gleason&#x27;s Cavalcade of Stars, and followed him, along with 16 dancers, to &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, where her signature was the overhead camera shot of the dancers making kaleidoscopic geometric patterns.

Taylor was initially dubious about joining Gleason on his DuMont Network show because it meant signing a long-term contract; her husband, Sol Lerner, suggested she take the offer. The high-kicking, smiling routines that formed the first three minutes of each broadcast were Broadway-based and reminiscent of The Rockettes. In addition to Gleason&#x27;s show, the June Taylor Dancers also made appearances at the General Motors Motorama auto shows in New York and Boston and on &quot;Stage Show&quot;. Gleason and Taylor also worked together to produce a television ballet, &quot;Tawny&quot;, in 1953; the music was done by Gleason and the choreography by Taylor.

Taylor won an Emmy Award for choreography in 1955. Mercedes Ellington, granddaughter of Duke Ellington and daughter of Mercer Ellington, became the group&#x27;s first and only African-American dancer in 1963. In a Dance Magazine article after Taylor&#x27;s death, Mercedes Ellington emphasized Taylor&#x27;s role as a mentor in her career, saying that “she looked after me.” In 1965, the June Taylor Dancers added male performers to the troupe.

In 1978, Taylor, who lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after Gleason moved production of his show from New York to Miami Beach, began choreographing the Miami Dolphins cheerleading squad, the Dolphin Starbrites, and served in this capacity until 1990. The Starbrites, famous for their one-piece bathing suits and go-go boots, performed Broadway-style halftime shows.
== The June Taylor Dancers ==
The June Taylor Dancers, the group of sixteen female dancers that performed Taylor&#x27;s choreography on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, was an incredibly talented group of women who produced an immense body of work and had a profound impact on the development of tap dance as an art form through the 1950s and 1960s. At this time, tap dancers were struggling to find work as the public lost interest in tap and the professional dance economy collapsed. This so-called “death of tap” occurred for a variety of reasons, including new styles of music like bebop and rock and roll, musicals such as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; bringing ballet to the Broadway stage, laws taxing cabaret performances, and the growing ubiquity of television in people&#x27;s homes.

The complexity and excitement of a live tap performance simply did not translate to the small television screens. Blurry, pixelated screens and crude camerawork meant that the nuances of the movement were lost, and a dance form as specific and precise as tap suffered the most. This required stylistic innovation, with choreography that focused more on the larger shapes of the body instead of the intricate rhythms of the feet, so that it would appear dynamic on a small screen. Additionally, while professional dancers could previously perform the same routines again and again, television required an entirely new routine week after week. June Taylor took this in stride, telling The New York Times that “one of the first things I learned in television was the necessity of varying the style of the dancing each week … people want something new.” Taylor&#x27;s choreography does show a remarkable amount of variety, both within a single dance to keep viewers entertained and from week to week.

One dance from the April 21, 1956, episode, titled “Bumble Boogie,” features a 13-year-old violin prodigy playing live while the dancers in bumblebee costumes spin and tap around him. The dance features a range of steps from classical ballet pique turns and saut de basques to popular lindy hop and Charleston steps. The formational changes are complex, and the movement is all very precisely timed, requiring an immense amount of rehearsal in just one week. Other dances they performed on the show involve complex tap dance sequences, kicklines, and even twirling and throwing hula hoops. They often involve June Taylor&#x27;s signature overhead kaleidoscopic Busby Berkeley-esque shots, in which the dancers lie on the floor in a circle and move their legs to create different shapes together, an effect that could not be produced in a traditional stage setting. Due to the specific demands of television, the expectations of dancers changed, and it seems that those expectations became much harder to fulfill, as many dancers were not able to keep up. This emphasizes the unique hard work and success of June Taylor and her dancers, as they stepped up to fill the new roles created by the medium of television.

<text>English Tangier was the period in Moroccan history in which the city of Tangier was occupied by England as part of its colonial empire from 1661 to 1684. Tangier had been under Portuguese control before Charles II of England acquired the city as part of the dowry when he married the Portuguese &quot;infanta&quot; Catherine. The marriage treaty was an extensive renewal of the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. It was opposed by Spain, then at war with Portugal, but clandestinely supported by France.

The English garrisoned and fortified the city against hostile but disunited Moroccan forces. The exclave was expensive to defend and fortify and offered neither commercial nor military advantage to England. When Morocco was later united under the Alaouites, the cost of maintaining the garrison against Moroccan attack greatly increased, and Parliamentary refusal to provide funds for its upkeep partly because of fears of &#x27;Popery&#x27; and a Catholic succession under James II, forced Charles to give up possession. In 1684, the English blew up the city&#x27;s harbour and defensive works that they had been constructing and evacuated the city, which was swiftly occupied and annexed by Moroccan forces.

==History==
===Background===
Tangier has the best natural harbour on the western end of the Strait of Gibraltar, allowing its owner to control naval access to the Mediterranean. Since antiquity, it and Ceuta to its east were the major commercial centres on the north-western coast of Africa.

====Portugal====
The Portuguese started their colonial empire by taking nearby Ceuta in 1415. Years of conflict between Portugal and the Moroccans under the Wattasid and Saadi dynasties followed. In 1471, the Portuguese stormed Asilah to the west and threw Tangier into such chaos that they were able to occupy it completely unopposed.

By 1657, the position had changed. The Saadi dynasty steadily lost control of the country to various warlords and finally came to an end with the death of Ahmad al-Abbas. The main warlord around Tangier was Khadir Ghaïlan (known to the English of the time as &quot;Guyland&quot;). He and his family had taken control of much of the Gharb, the Rif, and the other coastal areas around Tangier. He appears to have considerably increased attacks on Portuguese Tangier.

Meanwhile, after the Dila&#x27;i interlude, the Alaouites came to the forefront. Mulai al-Rashid (known as &quot;Tafileta&quot; by the English) took Fes in 1666 and Marrakesh in 1669, essentially unifying all of Morocco except the ports occupied by Portugal, Spain, and England. He was supportive of restoring Muslim control over the ports, but he and the last of the Dila&#x27;ites (around Salé) still put their own pressures upon Ghaïlan.

The Treaty of the Pyrenees in November 1659 specifically pledged that Louis XIV of France would withdraw support from Portugal under the Braganzas and released Spanish troops and ships to pursue the continuing Portuguese Restoration War. Portugal, severely weakened and with little support in other countries, sought a renewal of its alliance with England to counterbalance the renewed Spanish threat to its independence.

The alliancewhich had originated in 1373had been adjusted and renewed in 1654 under Cromwelland was again renewed in 1660 after the English Restoration. Negotiations for the marriage of Charles to Catherine of Braganza (originally proposed by CharlesI) had started shortly after (perhaps even before) the Restoration, and the proposed marriage was mentioned by the Venetian envoys as early as June 1660. As part of the dowry, Portugal was to hand over the port of Tangier and the island of Bombay (now Mumbai) but it is unclear when those detailed terms were agreed upon or became publicly known. Some were widely rumoured early, certainly before the marriage treaty itself.

The Portuguese government was content to part with Tangier, though many within the country had reservations. The anchorage was not particularly safe for shipping and, exposed to the Atlantic and to destructive winds from the east, it was expensive to maintain, requiring significant improvement. Khadir Ghaïlan had mounted a major attack on the city in 1657, forcing the governor and garrison to appeal to Lisbon for assistance. Portugal, hard pressed in its war of independence from Spain and struggling against Dutch aggression in the East Indies, could not hope to maintain all of its overseas possessions without English assistance and could not afford to commit troops to the defence of Tangier while fighting Spain in the Iberian peninsula. Indeed, Portugal had even offered Tangier to France in 1648 to try to solicit support against Spain.

However, cession of Tangier to England was not popular with the general public and with many in the army. The governor of Tangier, Fernando de Meneses, refused to co-operate and had to be replaced in 1661 by the more compliant Luis de Almeida.

====Spain====
Spain had tolerated Portuguese occupation of Tangier as part of the Treaty of Tordesillas and had left its Portuguese administration largely undisturbed during the Iberian Union and even under the long-running Restoration War, lest a weakened position expose it to Moroccan reconquest. Nonetheless, Spain was strongly opposed to &quot;English&quot; possession of Tangier and insisted that the cession would be illegal. Indeed, the note presented by the Spanish ambassador in May 1661 openly threatened war.

A strongly established English naval presence at the Straits of Gibraltar posed a threat to its ports on both the Atlantic and Mediterranean and to communication between them. It also threatened communication not just with Spain&#x27;s colonial empire but with the maritime links between Spain and the Habsburg&#x27;s Italian possessions in Sicily and Naples. English fleet activities in the Mediterranean under Robert Blake and Edward Montagu between 1650 and 1659 had shown just how vulnerable Spain&#x27;s shipping lanes had become. With its emphasis on its transatlantic possessions, Spain had no Mediterranean fleet and could not protect its shipping there: the presence of a hostile naval force at Tangier would make the transfer of Spanish troops from Italy to Spain for the intended war against Portugal much more difficult.

By a proclamation of 7 September 1660 (announced in Spain on 22 September), Charles had declared peace with Spain, but in the same month the Commons passed a bill annexing Dunkirk and Jamaica. Both had been taken under Cromwell and both had been demanded back by Spain upon the ascension of CharlesII. There was a fear in England that the Portuguese commander at Tangier would hand the port over to Spain rather than &quot;heretic&quot; England or that Spain would otherwise attempt physically to prevent the handover, even if its actions fell short of war. There were further fears that Spain had enlisted Ghaïlan&#x27;s assistance to attack by land while Spain attacked by sea.

====Dutch Republic====
The Dutch had suffered intensely during the First Anglo-Dutch War. Although they were at peace for the moment, they were still competing intensely for trade and had no wish to see the English navy further establish the Mediterranean power it had developed under Cromwell. They &quot;were&quot; at war with the Portuguese and did not want to see the Anglo-Portuguese alliance renewed. The Dutch hoped to seize more of Portugal&#x27;s overseas possessions and had equipped a fleet for that purpose in 1660. They tried, unsuccessfully, to strengthen relations with KingCharlesII by the Dutch Gift in July of the same year.

The States General also sought in negotiations from July 1660 until September 1662 to secure a treaty or pact of friendship with England, but refused to extend such a treaty to any colonies outside Europe with the sole exception of the island of Pulo Run. While that negotiation went on, Charles offered to mediate between the United Provinces and Portugal. (The Anglo-Portuguese treaty, a very short time later, required this.) His intervention resulted in the Treaty of The Hague on 6 August 1661, although it was ignored by the Dutch East India Company. The Company seized Cranganore, Cochin, Nagapattinam, and Cannanore from Portugal in 1662 and 1663.

At the same time, King Charles sought the advancement of his nephew William (later WilliamIII) as Stadtholder. Johan De Witt, the &quot;Grand Pensionary&quot;, was a confirmed Republican and had excluded William through the &#x27;secret&#x27; (but widely leaked) Act of Seclusion annex to the Treaty of Westminster with Cromwell. The States General was unable or unwilling to rein in the Dutch East India Company&#x27;s aggressively anti-English and anti-Portuguese activities; the Republic hence had no significant influence in Restoration England, and De Witt&#x27;s diplomatic failures in 1660–1661 marked the beginning of the end of the Dutch Golden Age. Although De Ruyter&#x27;s presence in the Mediterranean necessitated caution, the English acquisition of Tangier could not be meaningfully opposed by the Dutch.

====France====
In France, Cardinal Mazarin was at the height of his powers following the formation of the League of the Rhine in 1658; the defeatwith the help of Cromwell&#x27;s army and navyof the Prince of Condé and Spain at the Battle of the Dunes the same year; and the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees on 7 November 1659. Spain (then allied with English Royalists) and France (allied with Commonwealth England) made peace, and by the treaty LouisXIV was betrothed to Maria Theresa of Spain. The treaty also required France to cease direct or indirect support for Portugal. In May 1660, six months after the treaty was signed, CharlesII was restored. Mazarin realized that an alliance between Restoration England and Spain, with its extensive lands in Italy and the Netherlands, would almost surround France and leave both more powerful than he wished; he worked quickly to restore relations with Charles&#x27;s court. By August, he had proposed the marriage of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, to Charles&#x27;s sister Henrietta Anne. It is likely that he encouraged the Braganza marriage, but he died on 9 March 1661 and Louis took personal control of his government. In July 1661, Louis sent the Comte d&#x27;Estrades as his ambassador to London, and it is clear from the instructions and correspondence between them that the treaty between England and Portugal was welcomed by France. At the time, France had no significant Mediterranean or East Indies naval presence, and English possession of Tangier and Bombay posed no apparent threat. In 1656, Louis or Mazarin had proposed the cession of Tangier to France, but no agreement had been reached and the peace with Spain probably precluded any further similar proposal.

====England====
In 1659, Cromwell&#x27;s England was allied to France by the 1657 Treaty of Paris; was allied to Portugal, was at war with Spain, and was not a party to the Treaty of the Pyrenees. King Charles II&#x27;s government in exile was, technically, allied to Spain and so pledged to resist Portugal&#x27;s independence and to raise forces against France by the 1656 Treaty of Brussels, the converse of the Commonwealth position. After his restoration, Charles declared peace with Spain in September 1660 but there was already speculation about a possible Portuguese marriage. There is debate as to who proposed Charles&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Braganza and when; but by a letter dated 5 or 15 June 1660, the queen regent of Portugal Luisa de Guzmán requested Charles&#x27;s consent to send Francisco de Mello as an ambassador extraordinary to negotiate a new treaty. According to Clarendon&#x27;s account, the ambassador suggested the treaty and marriage to the lord chamberlain the Earl of Manchester, who informed the King. Charles consulted Clarendon (Lord Chancellor), Southampton (Lord Treasurer), Ormonde (Lord Steward of the Household), Lord Manchester, and Sir Edward Nicholas (Secretary of State) and enquired as to Tangier to the Admirals Lord Sandwich and Sir John Lawson. Clarendon is vague, perhaps misleading, as to chronology. Ambassador De Mello had a private audience with Charles on 28 July 1660 (7 August 1660 NS) and, after other meetings, returned to Lisbon on 18 or 28 October 1660. The Queen Regent was pleased and made him Marquis de Sande. He returned to England on 9 February 1661 (NS) and from then until the announcement of the marriage at the opening of the Cavalier Parliament on 8 or 18 May 1661 there were rumours and counter-rumours, amongst them suggested marriages to Mademoiselle d&#x27;Orleans (who had previously rejected Charles), to an unidentified &#x27;Princess of Parma&#x27;, and to Princess Maria of Nassau. Indeed, rumours continued even after that, but the treaty was signed on 23 June 1661 and witnessed by Clarendon, Southampton, Albemarle, Ormonde, Manchester, Nicholas, and Morrice.

===English occupation===
====Sandwich and Portugal 1661–1662====
Before the treaty with Portugal and marriage to Catherine was announced at Charles&#x27;s coronation on 8 May 1661, Admiral Sir Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich was commissioned to bring Catherine over to England. The corsair fleet of Algiers was a growing problem. Montagu was instructed, by negotiation or by bombardment, to secure a treaty with Algiers not to molest English ships. He also carried instructions to seek peaceful arrangements with Tripoli, Tetuan, and Salé. Sandwich left London on 13 June for the fleet assembled at the Downs and from there, with John Lawson as Vice-Admiral, sailed to Algiers, where he arrived on 29 July. There was little negotiation, and a short bombardment, but weather prevented more significant action. Sandwich left Lawson to blockade Algiers, and proceeded to Lisbon, not yet in his official capacity as an Ambassador Extraordinaire, but rather to meet a second English fleet which was to take possession of Tangier. There was a perceived danger that the Spanish and Dutch would attack the Portuguese Brazil fleet and, reciprocally, Spain and the allied Dutch merchants feared that the English would attack the Spanish treasure fleet; hence there was some careful watching until those both arrived safely. The marriage, by proxy, of Charles and Catherine was notified to the Governor of Tangier (Don Luis D&#x27;Almeida) by letter from the King of Portugal on 4 September 1661. Lord Sandwich sailed back to Tangier on 3 October (arriving 10 October) taking transports for the evacuation of the Portuguese Tangier Garrison. He remained there for some three months, while awaiting the further fleet from England bringing the new Governor and troops. Still expecting trouble from Spain or the Netherlands, Lawson&#x27;s squadron joined him, unsuccessful in subduing Algiers (although a storm severely damaged the harbour there the next year and enabled a peace later). During the waiting time, there was correspondence with the other Barbary ports, and with Ghaïlan, who ostensibly welcomed Sandwich. Sandwich had met Ghaïlan before, when watering the fleet during his 1657 voyage with Robert Blake in the Mediterranean. It is likely that Sandwich also used the time to obtain details of the city and its defences – Martin Beckman was with Sandwich&#x27;s fleet at Algiers and Tangier and produced the map later seen and admired by Pepys. It was reported that Sir John Lawson and Sir Richard Stayner purchased houses in the town during this time and, perhaps, Sandwich also bought then the house he later owned.

In England, a Tangier Committee of the King&#x27;s Privy Council was appointed, with its members including Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, and Prince Rupert of the Rhine. Pepys later claimed that all Rupert did in meetings was to laugh and swear occasionally.

====Portuguese raid and handing Tangier to the English====

On 14 January 1662, the Portuguese garrison consisting of 140 cavalry attempted a sally out into the surrounding countryside, taking about 400 head of cattle, and also capturing 35 women and girls. Unsurprisingly, the Moroccans numbering around 100 counter-attacked and recovered the booty, killing some 51 of the Portuguese, including the Aidill (the military commander) and twelve knights, pursuing the remainder of the force to the city gates. Alarmed, the Governor (Luis de Almeida) requested assistance from Sandwich&#x27;s fleet in the bay. Sandwich sent parties of seamen ashore to man the defences, under the command of Sir Richard Stayner, effectively (but not formally) taking control of the city to help protect it against attacks by Ghaïlan (supported by Spain) and, perhaps, to ensure a withdrawal by the Portuguese. By 23 January, Sandwich had three to four hundred men ashore.

====Peterborough, Teviot, Bridge, FitzGerald, Belasyse and Ghaïlan 1662–1666====
On 6 September 1661, King Charles had appointed Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough, as governor and captain general of all the forces in Tangier. Peterborough quite quickly raised a regiment in England, probably in large part from the Parliamentary forces which were being disbanded, but otherwise took some time over the preparations; he finally sailed for Tangier on 15 January 1662, arriving, with a considerable force, on 29 January. When Peterborough landed he found the fleet already in possession. The Tangier Garrison (his new regiment augmented by units from Flanders) disembarked on 30 January and the city keys were handed over with due ceremony.

The start was far from auspicious. The available accommodation was completely insufficient for the three thousand or so troops, who had little in common (neither language nor, for the most part, religion or custom) with the Portuguese population; the money (such as was available to the new occupants) was English currency, unfamiliar to the townspeople. The basis of the Portuguese garrison had, in large part, been a militia of the men of the town and they, of course, had been driven back within the walls. Given that Portugal had been seeking (and, latterly, expecting) to dispose of Tangier; had a major war with Spain at home; and needed to raise a very significant dowry for the marriage; it is not surprising that some neglect may have crept in but it is also clear that Peterborough was not well prepared. The list of the stores which were immediately required, even after Sandwich had provided much from the fleet, is a tacit admission of the inadequacy of those brought with the occupation force. Peterborough reported that the Portuguese, leaving, had carried off &quot;the very ffloers, the Windowes, and the Dores&quot;, but since most of the inhabitants, and their possessions, were repatriated by the English fleet, that may be an exaggeration.

Moreover, the idea that the Portuguese inhabitants would enrol as soldiers for the new Government is nowhere reflected in the forecast expenditure of the garrison, except in respect of a troop of horse which did, in fact, enrol.

At the time when Peterborough arrived, Ghaïlan was engaged at Salé, fighting with Mohammed al-Hajj ibn Abu Bakr al-Dila&#x27;i (known to the English as &quot;Ben Bowker&quot;) the last (as it turned out) of the Dila&#x27;ites but, with his army, he appeared close to Tangier around 22 March 1662, and Peterborough arranged parleys.

Perhaps indicative of the problem with borders or limits to English possession of the city is the map of the forts around Tangier in 1680. To the East, beyond York Fort, and beyond the ominous, all-embracing, area marked as &quot;The Moors&quot;, are the words &quot;To Portugal Cross&quot;. It is perfectly likely that this refers to a form of padrão marking what the Portuguese considered to be the border. English occupation never came close to establishing such a distant frontier.

These units were augmented later in 1662 by elements of Rutherfurd&#x27;s (Scottish Royalist) Regiment and Roger Alsop&#x27;s (Parliamentarian) Regiment just before Peterborough was replaced by Andrew Rutherfurd, 1st Earl of Teviot as Governor. The regiments were merged (into two in 1662) ultimately becoming a single regiment (1668), and this, the Tangier Regiment, remained in Tangier thereafter, a total of 23 years, until the port was finally evacuated in 1684.

Each redoubt had four hundred men guarding the excavation site, while to the front balls of spikes, stakes and piles of gunpowder-and-stone mix, which acted as basic landmines, were laid.

====Norwood, Middleton and Inchiquin 1666–1680====
In 1674, William O&#x27;Brien, 2nd Earl of Inchiquin took up the post of governor, in succession to the Earl of Middleton. In 1675, a garrison school was founded, led by the Rev. Dr George Mercer.

On 30 December 1676, Charles ordered a survey of the city and garrison of Tangier, which was costing about £140,000 a year to maintain. The survey showed that the total inhabitants numbered 2,225, of whom fifty were army officers, 1,231 other ranks, with 302 army wives and children. Amongst the buildings was a hospital and an army school.

On 4 June 1668, Tangier was declared a free city by charter, with a mayor and corporation to govern it instead of the army. The charter made it equal to English towns.

====Ossory, Plymouth, Sackville, Kirke and Mulay al-Rashid 1680–1683====
In 1680, the pressure from the Moroccans increased, as the Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail joined forces with the Chief of Fez in order to pursue a war against all foreign troops in his land. Reinforcements were needed at the Garrison, which was raised to 3,000 in number. The Royal Scots, shortly followed by a further (new) foot regiment, the 2nd Tangier Regiment, (later the King&#x27;s Own, 4th Regiment of Foot) raised on 13 July 1680, were sent to Tangier, reinforced by a composite King&#x27;s Battalion formed from the Grenadier and Coldstream Guards, the Duke of York&#x27;s Regiment (disbanded in 1690) and The Holland Regiment (the later 3rd Foot) and the remnant of the old Tangier Regiment. The King&#x27;s Battalion landed in July 1680, and fierce attacks were made against the Moors, who had gained a footing on the edge of the town, finally defeating them by controlled and well-aimed musket fire. The Battalion remained in Tangier until the fort was abandoned.

In 1680 the Earl of Inchiquin resigned and was replaced by Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory, who died before taking up his post.

In October 1680, Colonel Charles FitzCharles, 1st Earl of Plymouth, arrived as governor, but was taken mortally ill soon afterwards. Lt-Colonel Edward Sackville of the Coldstream Guards took over the governorship temporarily until on 28 December 1680 Colonel Piercy Kirke was appointed colonel and governor.

The garrison at Tangier had to be constantly reinforced, having cost nearly two million pounds of royal treasure, and many lives had been sacrificed in its defence. Merchant ships continued to be harassed by Barbary pirates, and undefended crews were regularly captured into slavery. The so-called Popish Plot in England had intensified the dread of Catholicism, and the King&#x27;s frequent request for more troops to increase the size of the garrison raised suspicions that a standing army was being retained in Tangier to ensure both a Catholic succession and the political system of absolute monarchy.

In England, in the Exclusion Crisis, the House of Commons of England petitioned the King to give his assent to the Bill of Exclusion (which had passed the Commons, but not the Lords) intended to disinherit the Duke of York (later James II and VII). The Earl of Shaftesbury (effectively the Prime Minister) urged Parliament to disapprove any taxes unless and until the bill was passed. The King refused to prejudice his brother&#x27;s right of succession and dismissed the Exclusion Bill Parliament and, later, the Oxford Parliament. But he could no longer afford the cost of the colony in Tangier.

====Dartmouth and evacuation 1683–1684====
For some time Parliament had been concerned about the cost of maintaining the Tangier garrison. By 1680 the King had threatened to give up Tangier unless the supplies were voted for its sea defences, intended to provide a safe harbour for shipping. The fundamental problem was that in order to keep the town and harbour free from cannon fire the perimeter of the defended area had to be vastly increased. A number of outworks were built but the siege of 1680 showed that the Moroccans were capable of isolating and capturing these outworks by entrenchments and mining. Although the attempt by Sultan Moulay Ismail of Morocco to seize the town had been unsuccessful, a crippling blockade by the Jaysh al-Rifi ultimately forced the English to withdraw. In 1683, Charles gave Admiral Lord Dartmouth secret orders to abandon Tangier. Dartmouth was to level the fortifications, destroy the harbour, and evacuate the troops. In August 1683 Dartmouth, as Admiral of the Fleet and governor and captain general in Tangier, sailed from Plymouth. He was accompanied by Samuel Pepys, who wrote an account of the evacuation.

Once in Tangier, one of Lord Dartmouth&#x27;s main concerns was the evacuation of sick soldiers &quot;and the many families and their effects to be brought off&quot;. The hospital ship &quot;Unity&quot; sailed for England on 18 October 1683 with 114 invalid soldiers and 104 women and children, alongside HMS &quot;Diamond&quot;. HMS &quot;Diamond&quot; arrived at The Downs on 14 December 1683. Dartmouth was also able to purchase the release of many English prisoners from Ismail&#x27;s &quot;bagnio&quot;, including several officers and about 40 men, some of whom had spent 10 years in the hands of the Moroccans.

All the forts and walls were mined for last-minute destruction. On 5 February 1684 Tangier was officially evacuated, leaving the town in ruins. Thereafter Kirke&#x27;s Regiment (i.e., the Tangier Regiment) returned to England. The main force of 2,830 officers and men and 361 wives and children finally completed the demolition of the harbour wall and fortifications, and evacuated the garrison during the early months of 1684. The 2nd Tangier Regiment left late in the second week of February for Plymouth with some 600 men and 30 wives and children. The Earl of Dumbarton&#x27;s regiment (The Royal Scots) went into quarters at Rochester, and Trelawney&#x27;s (Second Tangier) Regiment to Portsmouth.

===Aftermath===
Some of the departing soldiers were to be rewarded with large land grants in the newly acquired Province of New York. Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick, a lieutenant-governor of Tangier, became New York provincial governor and William &quot;Tangier&quot; Smith, the last mayor of Tangier, obtained 50 miles of Atlantic oceanfront property on Long Island.

==Infrastructure==
The English planned to improve the harbour by building a mole, which would reach long and cost £340,000 before its demolition. The improved harbour was to be long, deep at low tide, and capable of keeping out the roughest of seas. Work began on the fortified harbour at the end of November 1662, and work on the mole in August 1663. The work continued for some years under a succession of governors. With an improved harbour the town would have played the same role that Gibraltar later played in British naval strategy.

<text>Paula Jon Dobriansky (born September 14, 1955) is an American diplomat, public official, and foreign policy expert who served as Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs (2001–2009) and the President&#x27;s Envoy to Northern Ireland (2007–2009). A specialist in Central/East European affairs and the former Soviet Union, trans-Atlantic relations, and political-military affairs, Dobriansky held key senior roles in the administrations of five U.S. presidents.

Since 2009, she has been a Senior Fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s JFK Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and was named in 2018 the Vice Chair of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, the Atlantic Council.

==Early life and education==
Dobriansky graduated summa cum laude from Georgetown University&#x27;s School of Foreign Service and earned her master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees from Harvard University in political-military affairs. She is a Fulbright-Hays scholar, a former Rotary and Ford Foundation Fellow, and a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

Her Ukrainian-American father, Dr. Lev Dobriansky, was a professor of economics and prominent anti-communist activist who initiated the Captive Nations Week during the Eisenhower administration.

==Career==
===Government service===
Over more than 30 years, Dobriansky has served in high-level, Senate-confirmed, government positions. She worked at the National Security Council, the White House (1980–1987) on U.S. policy toward all East European countries and contributed to the crafting of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union. As Director of European and Soviet Affairs in the Reagan administration, she played a key role in the formulation of U.S. political and economic policies toward Poland, matters regarding the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and Soviet human rights issues.

From 1987 to 1990, Dobriansky was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs and served in that capacity in both the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. In 1990, she was named Deputy Head of the U.S. Delegation to the 1990 Copenhagen Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. That same year, she was appointed associate director (Assistant Secretary rank) of the Bureau of Policy and Programs at the United States Information Agency (USIA). And, in 1997, former President Bill Clinton appointed her to serve as a Republican commissioner on the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy (1997–2001), a Senate-confirmed commission.
In 2001, President George W. Bush nominated Dobriansky as Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, a position for which she was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In that position (2001–2009), she presided over a wide range of areas including human rights, international narcotics and law enforcement, refugees, oceans, environment, science, health, international women&#x27;s issues and was the head of delegation and lead negotiator on U.S. climate change policy. She is credited with having established and led the U.S.-India, U.S.-China, and U.S.-Brazil Global Issues Fora. She was also a staunch advocate of public-private partnerships and was a Founder of the U.S. Afghan Women&#x27;s Council. In 2007, while serving as Under Secretary, she became the President&#x27;s Envoy on Northern Ireland, for which she received the Secretary of State&#x27;s highest honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, for her contribution to the historic devolution of power in Belfast. 

On April 25, 2018, it was reported by U.S. media that President Donald Trump intended to nominate her for the position of Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, though it was never announced and David Hale was eventually confirmed.

===Business and academia===

After leaving government service in 2009, Dobriansky became a Senior Fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government&#x27;s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and later became part of the center&#x27;s &quot;Future of Diplomacy&quot; Project.

In January 2010, Dobriansky was appointed Distinguished National Security Chair at the U.S. Naval Academy, where she taught senior level foreign policy courses for three years. During this period, she was also a senior advisor at the Bipartisan Policy Center and was co-chair of the center&#x27;s Commission on Stabilizing Fragile States. And from 2010 to 2012, Dobriansky was Senior Vice President and Global Head of Government and Regulatory Affairs at Thomson Reuters, responsible for designing and implementing a corporate approach for engagement in Washington DC and key capitals around the globe.

Earlier from 1997 to 2001, Dobriansky served as Senior Vice President and Director of the Washington Office of the Council on Foreign Relations and was the first George F. Kennan Senior Fellow for Russian and Eurasian Studies.

<doc id="663801" wikidata="Q938422" url="?curid=663801" title="HMS Guerriere (1806)">
<text>Guerrière was a 38-gun frigate of the French Navy, designed by Forfait. The British captured her and recommissioned her as HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot;. She is most famous for her fight against .

Her career with the French included a sortie with &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot; in 1803, in which the two vessels were forced to make an escape from a British ship. They were harried by British forces of varying strengths during their journey back to port and only just reached the safety of Corunna, with &quot;Guerrière&quot; being engaged by the 74-gun until she reached the entrance to the port. She sailed in 1806 with several other French ships to attack British and Russian whalers, but was chased and brought to action by HMS &quot;Blanche&quot;. After a hard-fought battle, &quot;Blanche&quot; forced &quot;Guerrière&quot; to surrender, and brought her back to Britain.

Now commissioned as HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot;, she went out to the West Indies and served off the American coast for a number of years. She captured a number of privateers, and was still in American waters after the outbreak of the War of 1812. On 19 August 1812 &quot;Guerriere&quot;, under Captain James Richard Dacres, sighted the American frigate &quot;Constitution&quot;, under Isaac Hull. The two ships closed and after a fierce engagement the American managed to shoot away &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s fore and main-masts, leaving her un-manoeuvrable. Dacres struck his colours to avoid further bloodshed; the Americans then transferred her crew to &quot;Constitution&quot; and set fire to the badly damaged &quot;Guerriere&quot;.

==Career with the French==

===Sailing with &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;===
&quot;Guerrière&quot; served with the French Navy during the Napoleonic Wars under Commander Louis Alexis Baudoin, initially trapped in harbour by the Blockade of Saint-Domingue. She was with the 74-gun &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot; on 24 July 1803, when the latter ship was spotted by a British ship off Cape Picolet. The 74-gun HMS &quot;Elephant&quot;, under Captain George Dundas gave chase, and the two ships exchanged several broadsides. The 18-gun sloop HMS &quot;Snake&quot; appeared on the north-west quarter, but the &quot;Elephant&quot;, either because of the appearance of &quot;Guerrière&quot; to windward, or for another unexplained reason, failed to maintain her position alongside &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;. Consequently, both French ships were able to escape. However, &quot;Duquesne&quot;, a 74-gun armed en flûte (removing some or all of her armament), was captured.

&quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot; and &quot;Guerrière&quot; made for the European coast, eventually making the port of Ferrol in Spain. On 29 August they were spotted by the 38-gun frigate HMS &quot;Boadicea&quot;, under the command of Captain John Maitland. Unable to make out what the unknown ships he had sighted were, he gave chase. Before nightfall he had discerned that the ships were enemies, but heavy fog made it impossible to determine their disposition until just after midday on 31 August, when it became clear that one of them was a 74 gunner and together, they were more than a match for &quot;Boadicea&quot;. He nevertheless continued to close and tested the Frenchmen&#x27;s resolve with a broadside. After an ineffectual but vocal reply had revealed to him that the French ships were fully manned and armed, Maitland brought his ship about and began to escape. The French attempted to pursue but were unable to catch &quot;Boadicea&quot;, eventually returning to their original course.

The two ships arrived off Cape Prior on 2 September, when they were again spotted, this time by a British squadron under the command of Commodore Sir Edward Pellew. The only ship ready and able to pursue the French was HMS &quot;Culloden&quot;, under the command of Captain Barrington Dacres. He immediately began a pursuit and after a chase, managed to close the French and open fire. &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, being the weathermost ship, got into Corunna first. The forts defending the port opened fire on &quot;Culloden&quot;, but she continued to engage &quot;Guerrière&quot;, until almost within the port, at which point she hauled off and returned to the squadron. &quot;Culloden&quot; suffered four men wounded, whilst &quot;Guerrière&quot; had suffered considerable damage to her masts and rigging and had lost six men killed and 15, including her captain and first lieutenant, wounded.

===Battling HMS &quot;Blanche&quot;===
&quot;Guerrière&quot; was despatched from Lorient on 28 March 1806 in company with the frigates &quot;Revanche&quot; and &quot;Sirène&quot;, and the brig-corvette &quot;Néarque&quot;, with orders to attack and destroy British and Russian whalers in the Arctic, off Greenland. She became separated from the rest of the squadron, but was able to capture and burn several whaling vessels. By 16 July, news of her activities, including a recent sighting off the Faroe Islands reached Captain Thomas Lavie aboard the frigate HMS &quot;Blanche&quot;, then off the Shetland Islands. &quot;Blanche&quot; quickly sailed to the reported area and on 18 July, sighted &quot;Guerrière&quot;. At this point &quot;Guerrière&quot; was carrying 50 guns, to &quot;Blanche&quot;&#x27;s 46.

&quot;Blanche&quot; quickly closed the distance, but &quot;Guerrière&quot;, perhaps mistaking the British frigate for one of her squadron, did not initially take action. &quot;Blanche&quot; opened fire at about 15 minutes past midnight, firing two broadsides before &quot;Guerrière&quot; could respond. A fierce fight followed, with &quot;Guerrière&quot; eventually surrendering at half past one that morning, having lost her mizzenmast. &quot;Blanche&quot; had suffered light damage and four men wounded out of her complement of 265. &quot;Guerrière&quot; had suffered considerable damage to her lower masts, as well as to her hull, both above and below the waterline. Out of her complement of 350, 20 of her officers, seamen and marines had been killed, whilst another 30 were wounded, ten of them seriously. Many of the French crew had been ill below decks during the engagement. &quot;Guerrière&quot; had been aiming to cripple &quot;Blanche&quot; by firing to bring down her masts, so that &quot;Guerrière&quot; might escape. When this failed, &quot;Guerrière&quot; was eventually worn down and forced to strike.

&quot;Blanche&quot; escorted &quot;Guerrière&quot; back to Britain, arriving with her prize on 26 July in Yarmouth Roads. &quot;Guerrière&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Navy, after a repair and refit which brought her to 48 guns. The captain of &quot;Blanche&quot; was knighted and the first lieutenant was promoted.

==As HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot;==
&quot;Guerriere&quot; spent 1807 fitting out at Chatham Dockyard, and entered active duty in 1808 under the command of Captain Alexander Skene. She was based in Jamaica and on 15 February she captured the French privateer brig , of Nantes. &quot;Malvina&quot; was commanded by René Salaun and carried 14 guns and 60 men. She had been travelling with her prize, the British ship &quot;Juliana&quot;, which &quot;Guerriere&quot; recaptured.

In July 1808, the master of an American brig claimed the protection of a convoy from Jamaica, which was being escorted by the 64-gun HMS &quot;Veteran&quot;. The American traveled with the convoy for part of its journey, but twenty four hours after leaving its protection, he betrayed the strength and course of the convoy to the French. The French privateer cutter &quot;Peraty&quot;, under the command of M. Maurison, took up position in the convoy&#x27;s path, hoping to capture some of the ships. &quot;Guerrière&quot; surprised and captured the privateer after a chase lasting 24 hours. The privateer was found to be the former , which the French privateer &quot;General Ernouf&quot; had captured on 17 September 1807. The prize crew had sailed &quot;Barbara&quot; to Charlestown, where she had been refitted. As &quot;Peraty&quot;, she had sailed again on 10 September, having been furnished with supplies and provisions for three months of raiding. &quot;Peraty&quot; was armed with twelve 18-pounder carronades and had a crew of 80 men.

In 1809 &quot;Guerriere&quot; was under the command of Captain Robert Lloyd, formerly of . He was replaced in 1810 by Captain Samuel John Pechell, and in October that year, &quot;Guerriere&quot; sailed to Halifax.

On 1 May 1811 &quot;Guerriere&quot; stopped the brig off New Jersey&#x27;s Sandy Hook, impressing the apprentice sailing master of &quot;Spitfire&quot; (and citizen of Maine), John Diggio. Fifteen days later, the frigate mistook the sixth-rate for &quot;Guerriere&quot; and attempted to recover Diggio, leading to the Little Belt affair. The incident provoked a diplomatic furor and contributed to the tense atmosphere prior to the War of 1812. Pechell stayed with &quot;Guerriere&quot; until July 1811, when he returned to his previous ship, HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. He was replaced by Captain James Dacres, and in April 1811, she sailed for the Halifax Station.

In August 1811 she detained the American brig &quot;New Orleans Packet&quot;.

===Fighting USS &quot;Constitution&quot;===
During the afternoon of 19 August 1812, about southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, a sail was sighted on the weather beam bearing down on them. She was soon made out to be a man-of-war and &quot;Guerriere&quot; prepared for action, mustering 244 men and 19 boys at quarters. When the enemy hoisted American colours, Captain Dacres permitted the Americans in his crew to quit their guns.

The two ships exchanged broadsides for half an hour before the American ship closed her starboard beam and sent HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s mizzenmast overboard. Switching to the other bow, the American ship raked HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot;, which included sweeping her decks with grapeshot and musket fire, and then attempted to board. Samuel Grant, master&#x27;s mate commanding the forecastle, was badly wounded and at about the same time Robert Scott, the master, was shot through the knee and the Captain severely wounded. Captain Dacres ordered Lieutenant Bartholomew Kent to lead the marines and boarders from the main deck towards the forecastle, but the two ships parting at that moment meant that they were able to bring some of the bow guns to bear on the &quot;Constitution&quot;. William J. Snow, master&#x27;s mate, commanded the fore-most main deck guns and John Garby, acting purser, the after quarterdeck guns.

The two ships were clear of each other when &quot;Guerriere&quot; foremast and mainmast went over the side, leaving her an unmanageable wreck. The crew managed to clear the debris, but while they were rolling enough to put the main deck guns under water, the American ship came within pistol range to rake them. At this point, Captain Dacres called his remaining officers together and they agreed to strike the colours to avoid further loss of life. Fifteen men had been killed, including the second lieutenant, Mr Henry Ready; six were mortally wounded, 39 severely and eighteen slightly. Lieutenant Kent was wounded by a splinter early on.

They found that the enemy was the heavy frigate USS &quot;Constitution&quot; under Captain Isaac Hull armed with thirty 24-pounders on the main deck, twenty-four 32-pounders and two bored-out 18-pounders on the upper deck. Out of 476 men, nine were killed and thirteen were wounded. Captain Dacres was surprised and shocked to find a large proportion of British seamen amongst her crew, a number of whom had joined in the boarding party.

Hull wanted to take &quot;Guerriere&quot; as a prize but by the next morning it was clear that the ship was too badly damaged to salvage. The next day, she was set on fire by her captors; &quot;Constitution&quot; returned to Boston, Massachusetts. Dacres wrote a report of the action to the commander of the North American Station, Vice-Admiral Herbert Sawyer. A court-martial was held on board HMS &quot;Africa&quot; at Halifax on 2 October. It found that Captain Dacres was justified in surrendering his ship to save the lives of his remaining crew. The court also found that the masts going overboard was due more to their defective nature than the fire of the enemy. Captain Dacres was later given command of the 38-gun fifth rate .

Part of &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s crew returned to Plymouth on 16 January 1813 aboard . The French had captured and released &quot;Spy&quot; on 20 December 1812.

<text>Gandvik (northern sámi: &quot;Juvravuonna,&quot; kvääni: &quot;Juuriperä&quot;) is a city in Nesseby. The name is a compound of the words &quot;&quot;, and &quot;vik,&quot; meaning bay. 

In Norse mythology, Gandvík is a dangerous sea, known as the &quot;Bay of Serpents&quot; because of its tortuous shape. 

The 12th-13th century Dane Saxo Grammaticus stated that Gandvik was an old name for the Baltic Sea (a name misspelt Grandvik in some translations). The legend presumably refers to the Gulf of Bothnia. However, there are two opposite theories about where Gandvik was situated, based on the 1323 Treaty of Nöteborg: in the Arctic Ocean or the Gulf of Bothnia. Starting from the 1850s, the former received more support, in that Sweden had extended far out to the Arctic Ocean, but since the 1920s the latter has gained more support. However, &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;, dating from the former part of the 13th century, is by most opinions referring to the White Sea when it uses the term Gandvik.

<doc id="663810" wikidata="Q1979837" url="?curid=663810" title="New social movements">
<text>The term new social movements (NSMs) is a theory of social movements that attempts to explain the plethora of new movements that have come up in various western societies roughly since the mid-1960s (i.e. in a post-industrial economy) which are claimed to depart significantly from the conventional social movement paradigm.

There are two central claims of the NSM theory. First, that the rise of the post-industrial economy is responsible for a new wave of social movement and second, that those movements are significantly different from previous social movements of the industrial economy. The primary difference is in their goals, as the new movements focus not on issues of materialistic qualities such as economic wellbeing, but on issues related to human rights (such as gay rights or pacifism).

Thinkers have related these movements with the postmaterialism hypothesis and New Class Model as put forth by Ronald Inglehart.

==The new movements==
Numerous social movements from mid-1960s differed from their precursors, such as the labor movement, which had previously been seen as focused on economic concerns. The 1960s were a period of transformation in collective action, the French May (1968) probably being its most determinant moment. It is important to highlight, however, that it is currently being discussed whether this phenomenon was the first example of a new social movement or as Staricco has stated: &quot;It did not so much open an era as close a one. It was not the beginning of a paradigm, but the end of another one. What comes after – the growing importance of new social movements both empirically and theoretically – can be understood as a consequence, but not as a continuation or progression&quot;.

The new movements instead of pushing for specific changes in public policy emphasize social changes in identity, lifestyle and culture. Thus the social aspect is seen by the NSM as more important than the economic or political aspects. Some NSM theorists, like F. Parkin (&quot;Middle Class Radicalism&quot;, 1968), argue that the key actors in these movements are different as well, as they are more likely to come from the &quot;new middle class&quot; rather than the lower classes. Unlike pressure groups that have a formal organisation and &#x27;members&#x27;, NSMs consist of an informal, loosely organised social network of &#x27;supporters&#x27; rather than members. British sociologist Paul Byrne (1997) described New Social Movements as &#x27;relatively disorganised&#x27;.

Protest groups tend to be single issue based and are often local in terms of the scope of change they wish to effect. In contrast, NSMs last longer than single issue campaigns and wish to see change on an (inter)national level on various issues in relation to their set of beliefs and ideals. A NSM may, however adopt the tactic of a protest campaign as part of its strategy for achieving wider-ranging change.

Examples of those new movements include the women&#x27;s movement, the ecology movement, gay rights movement and various peace movements, among others.

==The theory==
Buechler argues that there is in fact no single new social movement theory, but a set of new social movement theories, each a variant on a general approach to &quot;something called the new social movement&quot;, which he cautiously defines as a &quot;diverse array of collective actions that has presumably displaced the old social movement of proletarian revolution&quot;.

According to Kendall, the new social movement theory focuses on movement culture; it also pays attention to their identity and on their relations to culture, ideology, and politics.

Important contributors in the field include sociologists such as Alain Touraine, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Claus Offe, Immanuel Wallerstein, Manuel Castells or philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Jürgen Habermas and Félix Guattari.

==Characteristics==
The most noticeable feature of new social movements is that they are primarily social and cultural and only secondarily political, if at all. Departing from the worker&#x27;s movement, which was central to the political aim of gaining access for the working class with the extension of citizenship and representation, new social movements such as youth culture movement concentrate on bringing about social mobilization through cultural innovations, development of new life-styles and transformation of identities. It is clearly elaborated by Habermas that new social movements are the ‘new politics’ which is about quality of life, individual self-realisation and human rights whereas the ‘old politics’ focus on economic, political, and military security. This can be exemplified in the gay liberation, the focus of which broadens out from political issue to social and cultural realization and acceptance of homosexuality. Hence, new social movements are understood as new because they are first and foremost social.

New social movements also give rise to a great emphasis on the role of post-material values in contemporary and post-industrial society as opposed to conflicts over material resources. According to Melucci, one of the leading new social movement theorists, these movements arise not from relations of production and distribution of resources but within the sphere of reproduction and the life world, as a result of which, the concern has shifted from the sole production of economic resources directly connected to the needs for survival or for reproduction to cultural production of social relations, symbols and identities. In other words, the contemporary social movements are rejections of the materialistic orientation of consumerism in capitalist societies by questioning the modern idea that links the pursuit of happiness and success closely to growth, progress, and increased productivity and by promoting alternative values and understandings in relation to the social world. As an example, the environmental movement that has appeared since the late 1960s throughout the world, with its strong points in the United States and Northern Europe, has significantly brought about a ‘dramatic reversal’ in the ways we consider the relationship between economy, society and nature.

Further, new social movements are located in civil society or the cultural sphere as a major arena for collective action rather than instrumental action in the state, which Claus Offe characterises as ‘bypass the state’. Moreover, with its little concern to directly challenge the state, new movements are regarded as anti-authoritarian and resisted incorporation in institutional levels. They tend to focus on single issue, or a limited range of issues connected to a single broad theme such as peace and environment. Without the attempt to develop a total politics under a single focus, new social movements set their stress on grass-roots in the aim of representing the interests of marginal or excluded groups. Paralleled with this ideology, the organization form of new collective actions is also locally based, centred on small social groups and loosely held by personal or informational networks such as radios, newspapers, and posters. This ‘local- and issue-centred’ characteristic which does not necessarily require a highly agreed ideology or agreement on ultimate ends makes these new movements distinctive from the ‘old’ labour movement with a high degree of tolerance of political and ideological difference appealing to broader sections of population.

Additionally, if old social movements namely the worker&#x27;s movement presupposed a working–class base and ideology, the new social movements are presumed to draw from a different social class base, that is, ‘the new class’, as a complex contemporary class structure that Claus Offe identifies as ‘threefold’: the new middle class, elements of the old middle class and peripheral groups outside the labour market. As stated by Offe, the new middle class in association with the old one is evolved in the new social movements because of their high levels of education and their access to information and resources that lead to the questions of the way society is valued; the group of people that are marginal in terms of labour market such as students, housewives and the unemployed participate in the collective actions as a consequence of their disposable resource of time, their position in the receiving end of bureaucratic control and disability to be fully engaged in the society based on employment and consumption. The main character in old social movements, the industrial working class, nonetheless, is absent here in the class base of new social mobilizations.

==Criticism==
Some sociologists, like Paul Bagguley and Nelson Pichardo, criticize NSM theory for a number of reasons, including:
# the movements concerned with non-materialistic issues existed (in one extent or another) during the industrial period and traditional movements, concerned with economic well-being, still exist today,
# there are few unique characteristics of the new social movements, when compared to the traditional movements,
# differences between older and newer movements have been explained by older theories,
# there is doubt in terms of whether contemporary movements are specifically a product of postindustrial society,
# NSM focuses almost exclusively on left-wing movements and does not consider right-wing,
# the term &quot;new middle class&quot; is amorphous and not consistently defined, and
# might be better viewed as a certain instance of social movement theory rather than a brand new one.
# NSM is largely an extension of 1960s counterculture and built more around protest than any common (internal) unity,
# newer movements are exceptionalist, where members or proponents see older movements as ineffective or insignificant 
# recent NSMs are fueled by social media and meme culture, often diminishing their seriousness and meaning

<text>Stewart Ross Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood, (25 February 1941 – 29 January 2018) was a Scottish academic, public servant, and one of Britain&#x27;s most distinguished philosophers of religion. He sat as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.

==Education==
He was educated at Robert Gordon&#x27;s College. In 1963 he graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a first-class Master of Arts in Philosophy, and received a Bachelor of Arts in the Philosophy of Religion from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1965.

==Career==
He was then appointed assistant lecturer in philosophy at the University College of North Wales, and three years later returned to Scotland as a lecturer at the University of Stirling. In Stirling, he established the Religious Studies department and recruited John Drane and the late Glyn Richards to work alongside him in this enterprise. Then in 1977 he became Professor of the History and Philosophy of Religion at King&#x27;s College London, and was subsequently appointed vice-principal and principal there in 1981 and 1985 respectively.

In 1990, Sutherland became vice-chancellor of the University of London, and was appointed chief inspector of schools two years later. He succeeded this post as principal and vice-chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, in which position he served until 2002. During his principalship the university made significant advances in teaching and research, effectively implementing organisational change. He was the provost of Gresham College between 2002 and 2008. In 1992, he was elected to the British Academy, and in 1995 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the same year he was knighted and became president in 2002. He served on the Higher Education Funding Council for England, and the equivalent body in Hong Kong.

Following his involvement in the establishment of the Age Concern Institute of Gerontology at King&#x27;s College London, he was invited by the incoming Blair government in 1997 to chair a Royal Commission on Long-Term Care of Older People. This recommended that government (including the NHS and local authorities) should be responsible for providing free care in the spirit of the NHS Act to all people even if their illness takes the form of a chronic mental frailty. His recommendations were taken up by the devolved Scottish government, though were never implemented for England and Wales.

==Philosophy==
As a philosopher of religion, Sutherland had focused on how people continue to be morally responsible human beings in pluralist societies without the metaphysical security of traditional and potentially divisive systems of belief. Influenced by his intellectual mentor, Donald M. MacKinnon, Sutherland&#x27;s approach has brought the clarity and rigour of the Anglo-American tradition of analytic philosophy into conversation with literary and philosophical thinkers on the European continent.

In &quot;Atheism and the Rejection of God: Contemporary Philosophy and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;&quot; (1977) and &quot;Faith and Ambiguity&quot; (1984), he explored continental thinkers including Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Camus and Weil. His Wilde Lectures at Oxford University – published as &quot;God, Jesus and Belief: The Legacy of Theism&quot; (1984) – explored a range of intellectual, moral and existential issues in contemporary philosophical theology, developing further his argument that Christian ethical and faith traditions continue to have an enduring value at a time when former patterns of belief have broken down. He further promoted his field of study in two influential edited volumes, &quot;The Philosophical Frontiers of Christian Theology: Essays Presented to D. M. MacKinnon&quot; (with Brian
Hebblethwaite), (1982) and &quot;Religion, Reason and the Self&quot; (with T A Roberts), (1989).

In two other edited volumes, &quot;World Religions&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Study of Religion: Traditional and New Religions&quot; (with Peter Clarke), (1991), he had contributed to the increasingly significant field of religious studies in school and university curricula, while also promoting understanding and mutual respect amongst peoples of different faiths.

==Achievements and honours==
Sutherland was made a Knight Bachelor in 1995.

On 29 June 2001, he was created a life peer as Baron Sutherland of Houndwood, of Houndwood in the Scottish Borders, and was the following year elected to the presidency of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In the introduction to the House of Lords ceremony, his Senior Supporter was The Lord Flowers and his Junior Supporter was The Lord Wilson of Tillyorn.

He was made a Knight of the Thistle in 2002, was the recipient of a number of honorary degrees, and continued to serve with various institutions. In 2004 he became a Fellow of Birkbeck, University of London. On 31 May 1996 he received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Theology at Uppsala University, Sweden.

In 2005, he became a member of the editorial board of the Encyclopædia Britannica.

<doc id="663850" wikidata="Q1479040" url="?curid=663850" title="Quadrathlon">
<text>A quadrathlon (or &quot;quadriathlon&quot;, tetrathlon) is an endurance sports event composed of four individual disciplines. All four disciplines are completed in succession and the lowest overall time decides the winner.

The World Quadrathlon Federation defines that a quadrathlon consists of 

in any order, though usually as above.

The distances, time duration and events depending on the organizing body, the location of the event and the time of year. During the winter months, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing may replace swimming and kayaking.

In Great Britain, the governing body is the British Quadrathlon Association (BQA).

The World Quadrathlon Federation has stated aim is to provide and promote International awareness for the sport of Quadrathlon. &quot;Quadrathlon adds flatwater kayaking to the sport of triathlon to create a balanced test of fitness.&quot;

The event is extremely intense, and requires training before entering. People who have entered the event have commented on the strain it puts on the body after each interval, &quot;My calves were so tight each step ricocheted through my body... By then I just wanted to be done&quot; female competitor Domity Mcdowell wrote. The competitors that complete the Quadrathlon are usually also involved in events such as the triathlon, biathlons and marathons. Danelle Ballengee, a professional female athlete who has competed in multiple events claims she &quot;just loves a challenge&quot;.

== World Cup ==

The World Quadrathlon Federation&#x27;s World Cup has been running since 2001, and constitutes a series of races in multiple countries. The scoring method for the series takes the four best results for each athlete, awarding points based on position. Each athlete can enter as many races as they choose. This method allows participation for as large a number of people as possible, given the cup&#x27;s geographic spread. The 2013 cup, which finished with the Bude Awesome Foursome, was won by Stefan Teichert in the men&#x27;s category and Lisa Maria Hirschfelder in the women&#x27;s, both of Germany.

The distribution of points per race decreases starting from 100 points. 1st-5th places are separated by 10 point increments, placings 5-11 are separated by 5 point increments, placements 11th-21st are separated by 2 point increments, from here the placement increments (21st-30th) are 1 point and any placements after that receive 0 points. International championship world cup races can be evaluated with more points that what was previously stated. Every place can be upgraded by 20 points, 1st place receives 120 instead of 100, 110 points instead of 90 for 2nd place, 21points instead of 1 point for 30th place. There are also bonus points for athletes who have finished more than four World Cup races in season. These athletes are awarded 10 points per every extra race completed.

== History ==
After failed attempts at beginning the quadrathlon in the early 80&#x27;s, a man by the name of &#x27;Prince&#x27; Sergio Ferrero initiated the first quadrathlon, held in 1987 on the island, Ibiza. This same man established the World Quadrathlon Federation (WQF) in 1990. This first quadrathlon consisted of a 5 km open water swim, 20 km open water kayak, 100 km bike and 25 km run. It was won by Philip Gabel from Australia in a time of just under 7 hours. The second edition in 1991 was won by Nigel Reynolds a dual citizen of Australia and South African who revolutionised the event by using a surf life-saving &#x27;Ski&#x27; in the paddle section which dramatically improved the speed and course time. Not much has changed from the first quadrathlon up until now, as only 1 km has been reduced from the swim. In 1997, under the guidance of Czech Vaclav Marek, the European Quadrathlon Federation (EQF) was formed.

== European Championships ==

The 2013 European Championships was held in the UK in Lincolnshire and was won by Steve Clark from Great Britain and Lisa Maria Hirschfelder from Germany.

== Rules of the event ==
There are a number of rules and regulations that both the athletes and officials must follow on the day of the event. These rules, if not followed correctly can end in warnings, penalties and even disqualification. Some of the general guidelines that the athletes must abide by are as follows;

No outside assistance, No flippers or snorkels while swimming, No riding too close to the other cyclists, No private food or drink, The competitor may not block, charge or make an abrupt motion so as to interfere with the forward progress of another competitor and the competitor is not allowed to give or receive physical help from external factors.

General rules for each sport include:

=== Swim ===
There are not any specific rules for swimming in general, simply the attire worn by the swimmers. No fluorescent bathers to be worn and bathers must cover sexual characteristics. Swim goggles and caps are allowed and the identification number must be displayed on either the arm or back of the leg.

=== Bike ===
In the bike section of the race a bike must ride individually and have a support either on foot or in a separate vehicle. No biker can enter a transition area and must follow traffic rules if the course isn&#x27;t closed to the public.

=== Kayak ===
The kayak must be ridden individually and non mechanical for any advantages. All kayaks/Canoes must be over 8 kg in weight.

=== Run ===
The upper body must be covered and footwear must be worn at all times, excluding shoes with spikes. No electronic devices can be used and any competitors leaving the race course for an advantage will be disqualified.

== Notable Athletes ==
=== Males ===
* Pedro Bartolomeu
* Bernat Torres

=== Females ===
* Noelia Simon
* Vanessa Jimenez

== Alternate versions ==
There has been other versions of quadrathlon. In 1984, in Australia, a version called &quot;Fosters&#x27; Quadrathlon&quot; included a 3-km swim, a 50-km race walk, a 160-km cycle ride, and a 42-km marathon.

In winter conditions, snowshoes and cross-country skiing usually replaces running and swimming.

<text>A vocational school, (alternatively known as a trade school, or technical school) is a type of educational institution, which, depending on the country, may refer to either secondary or post-secondary education designed to provide vocational education or technical skills required to complete the tasks of a particular and specific job. In the case of secondary education, these schools differ from academic high schools which usually prepare students who aim to pursue tertiary education, rather than enter directly into the workforce. With regard to post-secondary education, vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s &quot;toward a broader preparation that develops the academic&quot; as well as the technical skills of their students.

==Terminology==

This type of institution may also be called a trade school, career center, career college, or vocational college.

==By Region==
===Oceania===
====Australia====

Vocational schools were called &quot;technical colleges&quot; in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). This model of &quot;technical college&quot; has largely been superseded by vocational schools offering courses under a framework known as TAFE. Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as &quot;trade colleges&quot;. At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, St. Patrick&#x27;s Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College.

In Queensland, students can also undertake VET at private and public high schools instead of studying for their overall position (OP), which is a tertiary entrance score. However these students usually undertake more limited vocational education of one day per week whereas in the trade colleges the training is longer.

===North America===
====Canada====
Education in Canada is a provincial responsibility, and education evolved independently in each province, much like separate countries.
Vocational School is an old antiquated term that was previously used until the late 1960s when the education system evolved from basic primary education to include High School and then technical schools or colleges in the mid 1960s. In the past (pre mid 1960s) some provinces Vocational schools in Western Canada were sometimes called &quot;colleges&quot; in Canada. However, a college may also refer to an institution that offers part of a university degree, or credits that may be transferred to a university.

In Ontario Technical schools like Central Technical School in Toronto, which was started in the late 1800s to train workers in the evening, eventually evolved into high schools when the education system was extended to the high school level. When the public education system was expanded in by the early 1920s high school level education was provided in Technical / Commercial Schools or Collegiate Institutes in a hybrid high school/ college level like situation. In Ontario prior to the mid 1960s a Vocational School was a trades or job training school that provided training in a very focused trades related area, and these were started in the early 1950s, and the few that existed were merged as departments of the Community colleges that were established starting in the mid 1960s .

Secondary schools had evolved into three separated streams: technical schools, commercial and collegiates (the academic schools). By the mid 1960s in suburban areas purpose built High Schools for slow learners or individuals that were being trained for jobs after high school was also termed &quot;vocational schools&quot;. By the early late 1960s many of the technical and commercial school programs in large populated areas like around Toronto, were being merged or had purpose built combined schools were being built. While the schools still exist, the curriculum has changed so that no matter which type of school one attends, they can still attend any post-secondary institution and still study a variety of subjects and others (either academic or practical). In Ontario, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities divided post-secondary education into universities, community colleges and private career colleges.

In the Province of Quebec, there are some vocational programs offered at institutions called CEGEPs (&quot;collège d&#x27;enseignement général et professionnel&quot;), but these too may function as an introduction to university. Generally, students complete two years at a CEGEP directly out of high school, and then complete three years at a university (rather than the usual four), to earn an undergraduate degree. Alternatively, some CEGEPs offer vocational training, but it is more likely that vocational training will be found at institutions separate from academic institutions, though they may still be called colleges. Although many (if not most) vocational programs are in high school.

====United States====

In the United States, there is a very large difference between career college and vocational college. The term &quot;career college&quot; is generally reserved for post-secondary for-profit institutions. Conversely, vocational schools are government-owned or at least government-supported institutions, requiring two full years of study, and their credits are usually accepted elsewhere in the academic world. In some instances, charter academies or magnet schools may take the place of the final years of high school. Additionally, most schools offer off-campus buildings, or partner with vocational schools in order for students to gain a certificate, as well as gaining the needed credit to graduate. With the dual enrollment, the student would graduate with both their high school diploma, as well as their vocational certificate. 

Career colleges on the other hand are generally not government supported in any capacity, occupy periods of study less than a year, and their training and certifications are rarely recognized by the larger academic world. In addition, as most career colleges are private schools, this group may be further subdivided into non-profit schools and proprietary schools, operated for the sole economic benefit of their owners.

As a result of this emphasis on the commercialization of education, a widespread poor reputation for quality was retained by a great number of career colleges for over promising what the job prospects for their graduates would be in their field of study upon completion of their program, and for emphasizing the number of careers from which a student could choose.

Even though the popularity of career colleges has exploded in recent years, the number of government-sponsored vocational schools in the United States has decreased significantly.

The Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE) is the largest American national education association dedicated to the advancement of career and technical education or vocational education that prepares youth and adults for careers.

Earlier vocational schools such as the California Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University have gone on to become full degree-granting institutions.

===Central and Eastern Europe===


In Central and Eastern Europe, vocational education is represented in the forms of (professional) vocational technical schools often abbreviated as PTU, technical colleges (technikum) and technical high school.
;Vocational school (college)
Vocational school or vocational college is considered a post-secondary education type school, but combines the coursework of a high school and junior college stretching for six years. In Ukraine, the term is used mostly for sports schools sometimes interchangeably with the term college. Such college could be a separate entity or a branch of bigger university. Successful graduates receive a specialist degree.
;PTU

PTUs are usually preparatory vocational education and are equivalent to the general education of the third degree in the former Soviet education, providing a lower level of vocational education (apprenticeship). It could be compared to a trade high school. In the 1920-30s, such PTUs were called schools of factory and plant apprenticeship, and later 1940s - vocational schools. Sometime after 1959, the name PTU was established, however, with the reorganization of the Soviet educational system these vocational schools were renamed into lyceums. There were several types of PTUs such as middle city PTU and rural PTU.
;Technicum

Technical college (technicum) is becoming an obsolete term for a college in different parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Technicums provided a middle level of vocational education. Aside of technicums and PTU there also were vocational schools (Russian: профессиональные училища) that also provided a middle level of vocational education. In 1920-30s Ukraine, technicums were a (technical) vocational institutes, however, during the 1930-32s Soviet educational reform they were degraded in their accreditation.
;Institute
Institutes were considered a higher level of education; however, unlike universities, they were more oriented to a particular trade. With the reorganization of the Soviet education system, most institutes have been renamed as technical universities.

===Southeast Europe===
In ex-Yugoslavian countries (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro and North Macedonia) there are technical high schools that can have three or four years courses. If a person finishes three year course he will get a trade degree, or a technician degree if he finishes four. After technical high school a person can go to university. In Croatia there are two types of universities where people can continue their education: Classical universities (sveučilište) and Universities of applied sciences (veleučilište). In Universities of applied sciences, after three years students get a bachelors degree like in classical university, and after 5 years they get a professional specialist degree.

====Greece====
In Greece vocational school is known as Vocational Lyceum (2006–present), it was named Technical Vocational Lyceum (1985–1998). It is an upper secondary education school (high school) of Greece, with a three-year duration. Some have a wide range of majors, others only a few majors. Vocational majors are in Electrical Installation, Electronics and Automation, Meganotronics, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning Cooling, Nursing, Hairdressing, Graphic Design, Food Technology, Dental Technology, Aesthetic and Makeup, and others.

===Western and Northern Europe===
==== Finland ====

The Finnish system is divided between vocational and academic paths. Currently about 47 percent of Finnish students at age 16 go to vocational school. The vocational school is a secondary school for ages 16–21, and prepares the students for entering the workforce. The curriculum includes little academic general education, while the practical skills of each trade are stressed. The education is divided into eight main categories with a total of about 50 trades. The basic categories of education are
* Humanist and educational branch (typical trade: youth- and free-time director)
* Cultural branch (typical trade: artisan, media-assistant)
* The branch of social sciences, business and merchandise (typical trade: vocational qualification in business and administration ())
* Natural science (typical trade: IT worker ())
* Technology and traffic (typical trades: machinist, electrician, process worker)
* The branch of natural resources and environment (typical trade: rural entrepreneur, forest worker)
* The branch of social work, health care and physical exercise (typical trade: practical nurse ())
* The branch of travel, catering and domestic economics (typical trade: institutional catering worker)

The vocational schools are usually owned by the municipalities, but in special cases, private or state vocational schools exist. The state grants aid to all vocational schools on the same basis, regardless of the owner. On the other hand, the vocational schools are not allowed to operate for profit. The Ministry of Education issues licences to provide vocational education. In the licence, the municipality or a private entity is given permission to train a yearly quota of students for specific trades. The licence also specifies the area where the school must be located and the languages used in the education.

The vocational school students are selected by the schools on the basis of criteria set by the Ministry of Education. The basic qualification for the study is completed nine-year comprehensive school. Anyone may seek admission in any vocational school regardless of their domicile. In certain trades, bad health or invalidity may be acceptable grounds for refusing admission. The students do not pay tuition and they must be provided with health care and a free daily school lunch. Tools and practice material are provided to the students for free. Any necessary books are also free for all students born during or after 2005.

In tertiary education, there are higher vocational schools (&quot;ammattikorkeakoulu&quot; which is translated to &quot;polytechnic&quot; or &quot;university of applied sciences&quot;), which give three- to four-year degrees in more involved fields, like engineering (see insinööri (amk)) and nursing. Having a vocational degree also qualifies a person to apply to a university.

In contrast to the vocational school, an academically orientated upper secondary school, or senior high school () teaches no vocational skills. It prepares students for entering the university or a higher vocational school.

==== France ====

===== &quot;Lycée professionnel&quot; =====

In France, the &quot;lycée professionnel&quot; (LP, formerly known as a &quot;lycée d&#x27;enseignement professionnel&quot; (LEP)) grants a &quot;baccalauréat professionnel&quot; for students who do not plan to continue into higher education. Nearly 100 specialties are covered.

===== University Technical Institutes or &quot;IUT&quot; =====

In France, at post-secondary level, there are also university technical institutes (in French: &quot;instituts universitaires de technologie&quot;) offering vocational bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

====Ireland====
A vocational school in Ireland is a type of secondary education school which places a large emphasis on vocational and technical education; this led to some conflict in the 1960s when the Regional Technical College system was in development. Since 2013 the schools have been managed by Education and Training Boards, which replaced Vocational Education Committees which were largely based on city or county boundaries. Establishment of the schools is largely provided by the state; funding is through the block grant system providing about 90% of necessary funding requirements.

Vocational schools typically have further education courses in addition to the traditional courses at secondary level. For instance, post leaving certificate courses which are intended for school leavers and pre-third level education students.

Until the 1970s the vocational schools were seen as inferior to the other schools then available in Ireland. This was mainly because traditional courses such as the leaving certificate were not available at the schools, however this changed with the &quot;Investment in Education&quot; (1962) report which resulted in an upgrade in their status. Currently about 24% of secondary education students attend these schools.

In 2018, 26% of Leaving Cert students (over 30,000 people) sat the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme.

====Netherlands====

In the Middle Ages boys learned a vocation through an apprenticeship. They were usually 10 years old when they entered service, and were first called &quot;leerling&quot; (apprentice), then &quot;gezel&quot; (journeyman) and after an exam - sometimes with an example of workmanship called a &quot;meesterproef&quot; (masterpiece) - they were called &quot;meester&quot; (master craftsman). In 1795, all of the guilds in the Netherlands were disbanded by Napoleon, and with them the guild vocational schooling system. After the French occupation, in the 1820s, the need for quality education caused more and more cities to form day and evening schools for various trades.
In 1854, the society &quot;Maatschappij tot verbetering van den werkenden stand&quot; (society to improve the working class) was founded in Amsterdam, that changed its name in 1861 to the &quot;Maatschappij voor de Werkende Stand&quot; (Society for the working class). This society started the first public vocational school (&quot;De Ambachtsschool&quot;) in Amsterdam, and many cities followed. At first only for boys, later the &quot;Huishoudschool&quot; (housekeeping) was introduced as vocational schooling for girls. Housekeeping education began in 1888 with the Haagsche Kookschool in The Hague.

In 1968 the &quot;Mammoetwet&quot; law changed all of this, effectively dissolving the Ambachtsschool and the Huishoudschool. The name was changed to LTS (&quot;lagere technische school&quot;, lower technical school), where mainly boys went because of its technical nature, and the other option, where most girls went, was LBO (&quot;lager beroepsonderwijs&quot;, lower vocational education). In 1992 both LTS and LBO changed to VBO (&quot;voorbereidend beroepsonderwijs&quot;, preparatory vocational education) and since 1999 VBO together with MAVO (&quot;middelbaar algemeen voortgezet onderwijs&quot;, intermediate general secondary education) changed to the current VMBO (&quot;voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs&quot;, preparatory intermediate vocational education).

===South Asia===
====India====
In India vocational schools are mainly run by the government under the guidance of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Courses offered by the Government of India are Udaan, Polytechnics, Parvaaz, National Rural Livelihood Mission, Industrial Training Institutes, Aajeevika mission of national rural livelihood, Craftsmen Training Scheme. The Skill India movement has empowered the standards of all these institutions. Apart from these the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has included many vocational subjects in their senior secondary education.

===East Asia===
====Japan====
In Japan vocational schools are known as . They are a part of Japan&#x27;s higher education system. There are two-year schools that many students study at after finishing high school (although it is not always required that students graduate from high school). Some have a wide range of majors, others only a few majors. Some examples are computer technology, fashion and English.

<text>In Internet networking, a private network is a computer network that uses a private address space of IP addresses. These addresses are commonly used for local area networks (LANs) in residential, office, and enterprise environments. Both the IPv4 and the IPv6 specifications define private IP address ranges.

Most Internet service providers (ISPs) allocate only a single publicly routable IPv4 address to each residential customer, but many homes have more than one computer, smartphone, or other Internet-connected device. In this situation, a network address translator (NAT/PAT) gateway is usually used to provide Internet connectivity to multiple hosts. Private addresses are also commonly used in corporate networks which, for security reasons, are not connected directly to the Internet. Often a proxy, SOCKS gateway, or similar devices are used to provide restricted Internet access to network-internal users. 

Private network addresses are not allocated to any specific organization. Anyone may use these addresses without approval from regional or local Internet registries. Private IP address spaces were originally defined to assist in delaying IPv4 address exhaustion. IP packets originating from or addressed to a private IP address cannot be routed through the public Internet.

Private addresses are often seen as enhancing network security for the internal network since use of private addresses internally makes it difficult for an external host to initiate a connection to an internal system.

==Private IPv4 addresses==
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has directed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to reserve the following IPv4 address ranges for private networks:

In practice, it is common to subdivide these ranges into smaller subnets.

==Dedicated space for carrier-grade NAT deployment==

In April 2012, IANA allocated the block of IPv4 addresses specifically for use in carrier-grade NAT scenarios.

This address block should not be used on private networks or on the public Internet. The size of the address block was selected to be large enough to uniquely number all customer access devices for all of a single operator&#x27;s points of presence in a large metropolitan area such as Tokyo.

==Private IPv6 addresses==

The concept of private networks has been extended in the next generation of the Internet Protocol, IPv6, and special address blocks are reserved.

The address block is reserved by IANA for unique local addresses (ULAs). They are unicast addresses, but contain a 40-bit random number in the routing prefix to prevent collisions when two private networks are interconnected. Despite being inherently &quot;local&quot; in usage, the IPv6 address scope of unique local addresses is global.

The first block defined is , designed for routing blocks, in which users can create multiple subnets, as needed.

Examples:
A former standard proposed the use of &quot;site-local&quot; addresses in the block, but because of scalability concerns and poor definition of what constitutes a &quot;site&quot;, its use has been deprecated since September 2004.

==Link-local addresses==
Another type of private networking uses the link-local address range. The validity of link-local addresses is limited to a single link; e.g. to all computers connected to a switch, or to one wireless network. Hosts on different sides of a network bridge are also on the same link, whereas hosts on different sides of a network router are on different links.

===IPv4===
In IPv4, the utility of link-local addresses is in zero-configuration networking when Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) services are not available and manual configuration by a network administrator is not desirable. The block was allocated for this purpose. If a host on an IEEE 802 (Ethernet) network cannot obtain a network address via DHCP, an address from to may be assigned pseudorandomly. The standard prescribes that address collisions must be handled gracefully.

===IPv6===
In IPv6, the block is reserved for IP address autoconfiguration.
The implementation of these link-local addresses is mandatory, as various functions of the IPv6 protocol depend on them.

===Loopback interface===
A special case of private link-local addresses is the loopback interface. These addresses are private and link-local by definition since packets never leave the host device.

IPv4 reserves the entire class A address block for use as private loopback addresses. IPv6 reserves the single address .

Some are advocating reducing to .

==Misrouting==
It is common for packets originating in private address spaces to be misrouted onto the Internet. Private networks often do not properly configure DNS services for addresses used internally and attempt reverse DNS lookups for these addresses, causing extra traffic to the Internet root nameservers. The AS112 project attempted to mitigate this load by providing special &quot;black hole&quot; anycast nameservers for private address ranges which only return negative result codes (&quot;not found&quot;) for these queries.

Organizational edge routers are usually configured to drop ingress IP traffic for these networks, which can occur either by misconfiguration or from malicious traffic using a spoofed source address. Less commonly, ISP edge routers drop such egress traffic from customers, which reduces the impact to the Internet of such misconfigured or malicious hosts on the customer&#x27;s network.

==Merging private networks==
Since the private IPv4 address space is relatively small, many private IPv4 networks unavoidably use the same address ranges. This can create a problem when merging such networks, as some addresses may be duplicated for multiple devices. In this case, networks or hosts must be renumbered, often a time-consuming task or a network address translator must be placed between the networks to translate or masquerade one of the address ranges.

IPv6 defines unique local addresses, providing a very large private address space from which each organization can randomly or pseudo-randomly allocate a 40-bit prefix, each of which allows 65536 organizational subnets. With space for about one trillion (1012) prefixes, it is unlikely that two network prefixes in use by different organizations would be the same, provided each of them was selected randomly, as specified in the standard. When two such private IPv6 networks are connected or merged, the risk of an address conflict is therefore virtually absent.

<doc id="663862" wikidata="Q2604494" url="?curid=663862" title="North Ockendon">
<text>North Ockendon is the easternmost settlement of Greater London, England, and part of the London Borough of Havering. It is east-northeast of Central London and consists of a dispersed settlement within the Metropolitan Green Belt. It was historically an ancient parish in the county of Essex, which was abolished for civil purposes in 1936. North Ockendon is the only inhabited area in Greater London outside the M25 London Orbital Motorway. North Ockendon is north of South Ockendon, in Thurrock, Essex.

==History==

North Ockendon ancient parish had an elongated east–west shape, thus contrasting with a series of perpendicular parishes to its north and west. With the adjoining parishes this formed a large estate that is at least middle-Saxon or, perhaps, even Roman or Bronze Age. The parish church, dedicated to Mary Magdalene, was built in the fourteenth century, on the site of an earlier church.

From 1894, North Ockendon formed a parish in the Orsett Rural District of Essex. In 1931 the county council proposed that the parish should transfer to Purfleet Urban District as part of a review of districts triggered by the Local Government Act 1929. The proposals met with objections and by 1933 it was decided to divide the parish between an expanded Hornchurch Urban District and a new Thurrock Urban District. Purfleet Urban District Council took legal action in an attempt to revert to the earlier scheme, ultimately taking the case to the House of Lords without success. In 1936 the majority of its former area was used to enlarge the Cranham parish of Hornchurch Urban District. The remainder, around , became part of Thurrock Urban District. North Ockendon was still rural at the time of its inclusion in the Hornchurch Urban District, but it was anticipated suburban house building would soon encroach on the parish. The creation of the Metropolitan Green Belt meant the limit of London&#x27;s urban sprawl stopped just short of the parish boundary, and North Ockendon remained rural.

In 1965, Hornchurch Urban District was abolished, and its former area, including North Ockendon, was transferred to Greater London and used to form the present-day London Borough of Havering. North Ockendon and Great Warley were to the east of the M25 motorway when it was constructed. In 1992, it was proposed that the part of Greater London to the east of the M25 should be transferred to Essex, with the Great Warley section north of the railway transferred to Brentwood and the North Ockendon section to the south transferred to Thurrock. The transfer of North Ockendon from London to Essex was strongly opposed, with Nicholas Bonsor MP stating that his constituents agreed it had &quot;more affinity with Havering than with Thurrock&quot;. Following the review the Great Warley section was transferred to Essex, but the North Ockendon part was not, leaving it the only part of Greater London to be outside the M25 motorway.

North Ockendon is the location of Stubbers, a former stately home which was demolished in 1955, the grounds of which are now used as an activity centre.

Elizabeth Kucinich, wife of the U.S. congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, was born in North Ockendon in 1977.

==Demography==
North Ockendon lies within the Upminster ward. The 2011 census showed that the population was 96% white (92% British, 2% Other, 2% Irish). Indian, Chinese and Black African were 1% each.

==Geography==
To the east is a small area of fenland, which extends into Bulphan and the rest is clays and Thames alluvials. The land is very low-lying. The field boundaries are wholly rectilinear. In the far north, beyond the London, Tilbury and Southend line, it borders the villages of Great Warley, Little Warley and Childerditch in the borough of Brentwood. The settlements of West Horndon and Bulphan are to the east, and South Ockendon, to the south, is in the borough and unitary authority of Thurrock. It is the only significant settlement in Greater London which lies outside the M25 motorway.

The Church of St Mary Magdalene, North Ockendon has a probably re-used Norman nave door on the south side of the nave. Its tower was used in the first accurate measurement of the speed of sound, by the Reverend William Derham, Rector of Upminster. Gunshots were fired from the tower and the flash thereof was observed by telescope from the tower of the church of St Laurence, Upminster; then the time was recorded until the sound arrived, from which, with an accurate distance measurement, the speed could be calculated.

==Economy==
===Proposed data centre===
North Ockendon is the proposed location of the 175-hectare London Data Freeport data centre. , Havering Council was considering granting permission through a local development order.

==Transport==
The nearest railway stations are at Ockendon and Upminster.
London bus routes 347 and 370 directly link the area with Upminster and Romford, as well as Lakeside Shopping Centre (370 only), and Essex routes 269 and X81 link the area with Brentwood (both) as well as Grays (269) and Lakeside Shopping Centre (X81).

<text>Arthur Moritz Schoenflies (; 17 April 1853 – 27 May 1928), sometimes written as Schönflies, was a German mathematician, known for his contributions to the application of group theory to crystallography, and for work in topology.

Schoenflies was born in Landsberg an der Warthe (modern Gorzów, Poland). Arthur Schoenflies married Emma Levin (1868–1939) in 1896. He studied under Ernst Kummer and Karl Weierstrass, and was influenced by Felix Klein.

The Schoenflies problem is to prove that an formula_1-sphere in Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-space bounds a topological ball, however embedded. This question is much more subtle than it initially appears.

He studied at the University of Berlin from 1870 to 1875. He obtained a doctorate in 1877, and in 1878 he was a teacher at a school in Berlin. In 1880, he went to Colmar to teach.

Schoenflies was a frequent contributor to Klein&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences&quot;: In 1898 he wrote on set theory, in 1902 on kinematics, and on projective geometry in 1910.

He was a great-uncle of Walter Benjamin.

<doc id="663886" wikidata="Q767609" url="?curid=663886" title="Shane Filan">
<text>Shane Steven Filan (born 5 July 1979) is an Irish singer best known as a member of the pop vocal group Westlife, which was formed in 1998, disbanded in 2012, and regrouped in 2018. Westlife has released thirteen albums, embarked on twelve world tours, and won several awards, becoming one of the most successful musical groups of all time.

Filan has released three solo albums: &quot;You and Me&quot; (2013), &quot;Right Here&quot; (2015), and &quot;Love Always&quot; (2017). He has appeared sixteen times in the UK Singles Chart with number-one hits, making him one of the most-appeared Irish music artists in British music number-one singles history.
==Early life==
Shane Filan was born on 5 July 1979 in Sligo, Ireland. He is the son of Peter (1942-2020) and Mae Filan (née McNicholas) (1937-2019), natives of Roscommon and Mayo respectively. Filan is the youngest of seven siblings; he has three brothers and three sisters. From a very early age, Filan worked behind the counter of his parents&#x27; business – a diner in Sligo called the &quot;Carlton Café&quot;. He attended primary school at a local Catholic school, and secondary school at Summerhill College, with future &quot;Westlife&quot; bandmates Kian Egan and Mark Feehily. All three of them participated in a school production of &quot;Grease&quot;. The Hawkswell Theatre became a significant part of their careers.

Filan was a fan of Michael Jackson as a child, and says the singer inspired him to pursue a music career. Before Westlife, Filan studied business and accounting.

==Career==
===Six as One, IOYOU and Westlife (1997–2012)===

Before Westlife, Egan, and Feehily were with Filan in a band known as &quot;Six as One&quot; and, later on, &quot;IOYOU&quot;, with other Sligonians Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael &quot;Miggles&quot; Garrett. Filan co-wrote the &quot;IOYOU&quot; song &quot;Together Girl Forever.&quot; For six months, Shane&#x27;s mother, Mae Filan, tried to phone &quot;Boyzone&quot; manager Louis Walsh, eventually succeeding in talking to him about her son&#x27;s band. Three of the members were dropped and the other three, Filan, Egan, and Feehily, joined in finding two more singers for the band. The members that joined were Nicky Byrne and Brian McFadden, forming &quot;Westside&quot;. The name of the band was subsequently changed to &quot;Westlife&quot; as there were already several bands with the name &quot;Westside&quot;. Their first album was released in November 1999, titled &quot;Westlife&quot;.

With Westlife, Filan has received twenty-eight platinum discs and sold 55 million records worldwide. In his 2014 book &quot;My Side of Life&quot;, he revealed that in 2001, he had been the first member of Westlife to be offered a solo record deal, but that he had rejected it, as he was scared of going solo.

===Solo career, &quot;You and Me&quot; (2012–2014)===
On 20 October 2011, Westlife announced that they had decided to split and go their separate ways at the end of their 2012 Farewell Tour. In December 2011, press reports announced Filan was close to signing a solo deal with one of several potential competing UK record labels. Filan and his manager Louis Walsh, had been in talks with several of the labels at the time. &quot;There&#x27;s four, possibly five labels so far who have made it clear that they want to sign Shane,&quot; said a music source to showbiz writer Paul Martin.

In a March 2012 interview with Paul Martin, Filan said he would be signing within the next few weeks.

&quot;It&#x27;s exciting but, of course, I&#x27;ll be nervous. It&#x27;s only natural when you&#x27;re coming out of a band after 14 years, you don&#x27;t know where your life&#x27;s going to take you [...]

In 2013, Filan announced he had officially signed a record deal with UMG subsidiary London Records worth 20 million British pounds. UMG had previously offered him a solo deal in 2001; the first member of &quot;Westlife&quot; to have received such an offer, but turned it down. For the new deal, Filan stated that he had spent the past 12 months in both US and UK writing songs and recording, and that a forthcoming single and an album would be released later in the year.

On 10 May 2013, he announced that his first single would be released, along with three other tracks, later revealed in July to be &quot;Everything to Me&quot;, and &quot;Everytime&quot;, &quot;Today&#x27;s Not Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Once&quot;, respectively. The release date was announced as 25 August.

On 10 September 2013, Filan released &quot;About You&quot;, the second single from his album &quot;You and Me&quot;, followed by the album shortly after.

===&quot;Right Here&quot; (2015)===
After the Westlife split, bankruptcy, the &quot;You and Me Tour,&quot; and his debut autobiography &quot;My Side of Life&quot;, Filan announced on 13 March 2015 that he was working on his second studio album, &quot;Right Here&quot;. The album was mostly recorded in London and Denmark, and featured collaborations with Cutfather (The Saturdays, JLS), Jez Ashurst (Will Young, Gabrielle Aplin), Jon Maguire (Union J), Tre Jean-Marie (MNEK, Jason Derulo), and Girls Aloud.
The album was released on 25 September 2015, reaching No. 1 on the Irish Album Charts during its first week.

===&quot;Love Always&quot; (2017–2018)===
On 25 August 2017, Filan released his third studio album &quot;Love Always.&quot; and announced his next tour, the &quot;Love Always Tour 2017&quot;.

Previously, in April 2010, an unreleased solo song by Filan called &quot;Beautiful in White&quot; leaked on the Internet, but was incorrectly credited as being recorded by Shayne Ward instead of Filan. During this time, Filan also sang a duet with Irish country singer Nathan Carter. The album reached No. 5 in the UK Album Charts, making it his highest-charting album in the United Kingdom.

In 2018, Filan also had success in Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea. &quot;Beautiful in White&quot; was particularly successful in Asia.

===Westlife reunion with new single, album, and tour (2018–present) ===
On 3 October 2018 Westlife announced their reunion as a four-member group. In 2019 four singles were released, penned by Ed Sheeran. The group embarked on a hugely successful 50-date tour called &quot;The 20 Tour&quot;, in honour of Westlife&#x27;s 20th anniversary since the release of their first single in 1999. On 15 November their 13th studio album, &quot;Spectrum&quot;, was released.

==Personal life==
Filan married his childhood sweetheart, Gillian Walsh, on 28 December 2003 at Ballintubber Abbey, followed by a reception at Ashford Castle, Ireland. Gillian is the cousin of fellow band member Kian Egan, making Filan and Egan cousins-in-law. They have a daughter born in 2005, and sons born in 2008 and 2010.

Filan and his eldest brother, Finbarr, ran Shafin Developments – a property development company. The company was placed in receivership in May 2012 and Filan was declared bankrupt a little over a month later after suffering losses in Ireland&#x27;s property crash.

<text>The Taygetus, Taugetus, Taygetos or Taÿgetus () is a mountain range on the Peloponnese peninsula in Southern Greece. The highest mountain of the range is Mount Taygetus, also known as &quot;Profitis Ilias&quot;, or &quot;Prophet Elias&quot; (Elijah).

The name is one of the oldest recorded in Europe, appearing in the Odyssey. In classical mythology, it was associated to the nymph Taygete and it was named after her. During Byzantine times and up until the 19th century, the mountain was also known as Pentadaktylos (Πενταδάκτυλος; Greek for &quot;five-fingered&quot;, a common name during that period).

==Geography==

===Physical===
The Taygetus Massif is about long, extending from the center of the Peloponnese to Cape Matapan, its southernmost extremity. It contains the tallest mountain in the Peloponnese, the Profitis Ilias summit, reaching ; this is probably the classical Mount Taléton mentioned by Pausanias. The summit is an ultra-prominent peak. It is prominent above the Isthmus of Corinth, which separating the Peloponnese from mainland Greece, rises only to approximately . Numerous creeks wash down from the mountains and the Eurotas has some of its headwaters in the northern part of the range. The western side of the massif houses the headwaters of the Vyros Gorge, which carries winter snowmelt down the mountain, emptying into the Messenian Gulf in the town of Kardamyli.

===Political===

Taygetus overlooks the cities of Sparta and Kalamata, whose skyline it dominates. The mountain range lies within the prefectures of Arcadia, Laconia and Messenia. Taygetus is crossed by Greek National Road 82, which links Kalamata to Sparti and separates Northern Taygetus from the Central Range. The Rindomo Gorge separates the Central Range from Southern Taygetos. The section of Taygetus that forms the backbone of the Mani Peninsula is also known as Saggias, and is often not considered part of Taygetus. The central part of the mountain range is commonly called &quot;Skoteini Plevra&quot;, which means &quot;the dark side&quot; because the villages located there do not receive as much sunshine in the early morning and the late afternoon hours.

==Geology==

The mountains of southern Europe that fringe the Mediterranean Sea and run generally in an east-west direction are of the folded type generated by collision of the northward-moving African Plate with the Eurasian Plate. Where the northern edge of the African Plate is being subducted in an irregular line a second orogeny occurs that is not entirely understood. The mountains of Italy and Greece are a combination of folded mountains and fault-block mountains running in a northwest–southeast direction.

The Hellenic Subduction carries the leading edge of the African Plate under the Aegean Sea Plate at the Hellenic Trench. It follows an arc around the outer edge of the Peloponnese and Crete. The subduction on the west is to the northeast, on the east to the northwest, and north in the center. The average direction is N 21° E. In the islands and southern Greece a fault-block mountain orogeny prevails due to a double set of crustal movements. On the one hand the Aegean Sea Plate is being raised by the subduction. On the other hand, north–south extensional movements, yet unexplained, are pulling the plate apart, creating normal extensional faults and generating a parallel sequence of horsts and grabens, or rift valleys, running in a north–south direction.

Mount Taygetus is a limestone horst bordering the Eurotas Rift Valley. Below its eastern face is the Sparta fault, a normal fault striking perpendicular to the direction of extension. Footwall scarps are visible on the eastern side of Taygetus at the base of its spurs. They result from sudden slippages of the hanging wall in the direction of the dip, causing earthquakes. Single earthquakes result in 1–12 m of scarp. The Sparta fault is zig-zag in strike, varying between N 170° E and N 140° E. The maximum slippage has been 10–12 m in three increments. The earthquake of 464 BC, which levelled Sparta, resulted from a slippage of 3–4 m over a length of 20 km of the fault. The slip rate has been about 1 mm per year suggesting an average interval between earthquakes of 3000 years.

==Ecology==
The slopes of Taygetus are heavily forested, primarily with Greek fir (&quot;Abies cephalonica&quot;) and black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;). Devastating fires in 2005 and 2007 consumed much of the forests on the central west slopes, and only about half remain.

==History==
The slopes of Taygetus have been inhabited since at least Mycenean times. The site of Arkina, near the village of Arna, contains three beehive tombs and is still unexplored. Taygetus was important as one of Sparta&#x27;s natural defenses. The Spartans threw criminals into a chasm of Taygetus known as Ceadas or Caeadas ().
Recent evidence, found by the University of Athens, discovered remains of adult individuals which appeared to confirm that Ceadas was mainly a place of punishment for criminals, traitors and captives.

According to an Open University online course, &quot;The first century CE writer Plutarch explains that Sparta had a ritual by which newborn babies were judged by the elders and those thought unfit to be allowed to live were left at the foot of Mount Taygetos. However, no other source tells us this about Spartan practices, and no infant remains have been found at this site.&quot; While bones have been found at the site, a study determined they all belonged to adolescents and adults.

At the ancient period, on spring women tied around their necks a plant which was growing on the mountain and was called &quot;Charisia&quot;. This way they wanted to make themselves more passionately beloved by men.

During the era of barbarian invasions, Taygetus served as a shelter for the native population. Many of the villages in its slopes date from this period. In Medieval times, the citadel and monastery of Mystras was built on the steep slopes, and became a center of Byzantine civilization and served as the capital of the Despotate of the Morea. Mystras remains occupied by a tiny religious community. The buildings are remarkably well-preserved and a major tourist attraction in the region. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Religion==

The peak known as Taleton, above Bryseae, was &#x27;dedicated&#x27; to Helios, the Sun, to whom horses were sacrificed. Taleton was also &#x27;dedicated&#x27; to Zeus. Today, the mountain is closely associated with the holy Prophet Elias, and every year on the 20th of July (the Greek Orthodox feast day for the Prophet Elias), the small chapel at the peak holds a large festival, including a massive bonfire in commemoration of the Prophet Elias (a Greek-style transliteration of &#x27;Eliyah&#x27; (אליה), the prophet Elijah), as he is believed to have ascended up into heaven in a chariot of fire. The bonfire can be seen from anywhere with clear view of the summit, and it is for this reason that the town of Kardamyli is a local gathering point for those who wish to view the fire without having to climb the mountain.

==Recreation==
The highest point, Profitis Ilias, is a popular hiking destination and European walking route E4 runs along the lower slopes of the range. The view from the Profitis Ilias includes most of the Evrotas Valley and the Parnon range to the east, while the view towards the west includes Kalamata and the eastern half of Messenia. Most of the southwestern part of Arcadia can also be seen.

<text>Plettenberg Bay, nicknamed Plett, is the primary town of the Bitou Local Municipality in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. According to the census of 2001, the town had a population of 29,149. It was originally named Bahia Formosa (&quot;Beautiful Bay&quot;) by early Portuguese explorers and lies on South Africa&#x27;s Garden Route 210 km from Port Elizabeth and about 600 km from Cape Town.

== History ==

=== Middle and Later Stone Age ===
Nelson Bay Cave on Robberg and Matjies River Cave at nearby Keurboomstrand were inhabited for over 100,000 years by Middle Stone Age man and then later by ancestors of the Khoisan, who were possibly the same people who traded with the Portuguese survivors of the Sao Goncalves shipwreck. Their tools, ornaments and food debris can be viewed in these caves, which are still being excavated.

=== Colonial period ===

Long before Jan van Riebeeck landed at the Cape, Portuguese explorers charted the bay in the 15th and 16th centuries, the first being Bartolomeu Dias in 1487. Ninety years later Manuel de Perestrelo aptly called it &quot;Bahia Formosa&quot; or the Beautiful Bay. The first European inhabitants were 100 Portuguese sailors marooned here for 9 months when the &quot;São Gonçalo&quot; sank in the bay in June 1630. The survivors built two small boats, one which linked with a passing vessel while the other made it to Mozambique. A stone that they left behind on Beacon Island, known as the &quot;Van Plettenberg Stone&quot;, is now in the Cape Town museum. In 1763, the first European settlers in the Bay were stock farmers, hunters and frontiersmen from the Western Cape.

A stinkwood navigational beacon was first erected on Beacon Island in 1771. The original was a square block of stinkwood, inscribed with the latitude and longitude of Plettenberg Bay and erected to enable mariners to check their location. It was replaced by a stone one by Captain Sewell in 1881.

The bay housed a barracks for the Dutch East India Company in 1776. The Governor of the Cape, Baron Joachim van Plettenberg, renamed the town Plettenberg Bay in 1779. In 1869 the barracks was bought by St Peters Church and used as a rectory for the next 70 years. Today it is the privately owned Old Rectory hotel &amp; spa

In 1787/88 Johann Jerling erected a timber shed commissioned by the Dutch East India Company; the remains can still be seen and are preserved as a provincial heritage site.

In the 1830s, Plettenberg Bay was a stopping point for ships travelling through during the winter time, heading to India.[6]

As of 1833, the population of Plettenberg Bay was estimated around 400, with half being white, according to diplomat Edmund Roberts who visited the area.
Edmund Roberts noted that the bay had a large abundance of cattle and sheep. He also recognized &quot;the excellence of its butter&quot; and a timber industry.

===Modern period===
A whaling station on Beacon Island closed down in 1916. Parts of the iron slipway are still visible today. A hotel called The Beacon Isle was built on the site of the whaling station. This was replaced by the iconic Beacon Isle Southern Sun Resort which opened for business in December 1972. This building, designed by André Hoffe, has a layered atrium which pays tribute to the Guggenheim Museum of Frank Lloyd Wright.

Between 1960 and 1990 Plettenberg Bay holiday resort expanded dramatically, extending along Robberg Beach (&#x27;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&#x27;), and back towards the N2. During the apartheid period property within Plettenberg Bay was designated for whites only, with segregation of the beaches and toilet facilities. New Horizons, across the N2, was designated as a settlement area for coloured people in 1968. As the 1980s progressed informal settlements of Xhosa people grew up around the edges of New Horizons and in the area of KwaNokuthula which became a town.

Although Plettenberg Bay escaped most of the violence associated with the end of apartheid, the assassination of Chris Hani in April 1993 led to a protest march into the town from KwaNokuthula, during which industrial premises on the outskirts of the town were burnt to the ground. Formal segregation ceased with the repeal of the apartheid laws, but the consequences of the previously segregated property ownership remain highly visible to this day.

== Ecology ==

=== Land ecology ===
Local vegetation varies from Cape Fynbos to Knysna-Amatole montane forests further inland. The best examples of the original indigenous forest are to be found in the gully of the Keurbooms River, home to Knysna Loerie and Fish Eagles. Robberg Peninsula is essentially a Fynbos reserve.

=== Sea ecology ===
Plettenberg Bay hosts one of the largest seagull breeding colonies along the South African coast at the mouth of the Keurbooms River, named after the indigenous keurboom tree. There are many pelagic birds in the area as well as the endangered African oystercatcher which live along the shores.

The Keurbooms River estuary is home to the Knysna or Cape Seahorse, Hippocampus Capensis. This is South Africa&#x27;s only endemic seahorse, and is found only in the estuaries of the Keurbooms, Knysna and Swartvlei rivers. It measures about 12 cm in length, and attaches itself to eel-grass.

The Robberg Peninsula is home to a large Cape fur seal colony, seals can often be seen in the surf off Robberg Beach. Great white sharks, attracted by the seal colony, can also be spotted from the high ground of Robberg Peninsula. Southern right whales are a common sight in the bay during their breeding season from July to December. Bryde&#x27;s whales frequent the bay throughout the year being the most sighted during the summer months. Humpback whales migrate past during July and December. Killer whales (orca) and sei whales are occasionally sighted. Whales can be viewed from various viewpoints in the town as well as from Robberg Peninsula. Plettenberg Bay also boasts three species of dolphins which visit the bay throughout the year, these being the bottlenosed dolphin, the common dolphin and the endangered humpback dolphin.

The bay falls within the Agulhas Bank ecoregion (bioregion), specifically within the Agulhas inshore ecozone. There has been a long history of sport fishing from the rocks, ski boats launched from Central Beach, or in Keurbooms estuary. The sea life activity both surface and sub-surface varies considerably as either deep water upwelling brings cold water into the Bay, or warm water eddies over from the Agulhas Indian Ocean current offshore.

A distinctive flower-shaped sea shell called a pansy shell is endemic to this part of the coast, and is used as the symbol representing the town. Looking for these shells on the beach at low tide is a popular activity amongst visitors and locals alike.

== Climate and geography ==

Plettenberg Bay is typified by an extremely mild maritime temperate climate with very few rainfall or temperature extremes. It is located within the Knysna Afromontane Forest biome, containing temperate gallery forest, supported by the mild temperatures and high, evenly distributed rainfall.
* rainfall: 640 mm per annum.
The bay is defined on the southern end by Cape Seal at the terminus of the Robberg (Afrikaans for Seal Mountain) Peninsula, separating the bay from the open Indian Ocean. It is one of the southern cape coast&#x27;s typical &quot;J-shaped&quot; bays, which is formed by wave action eroding the shales of the Bokkeveld Group between the weather-resistant headlands composed of the Table Mountain Group, both of the Cape Supergroup geological sequence of rocks. To the north, the Tsitsikamma and Langkloof Mountains keeps the moisture on the southern slopes of the mountains and prevent the temperature extremes of the interior reaching the bay.
== Tourism ==

The town is highly seasonal, with a large proportion of second homes used exclusively during peak holiday periods. Popular with domestic and foreign tourists alike, many make it a stop along the garden route to visit local attractions such as Robberg Peninsula Nature Reserve, the world&#x27;s largest free-flight aviary Birds of Eden, Sea Kayaking and Whale Watching, as a base to start the coastal Otter Trail, Monkeyland Primate Sanctuary or a host of other outdoor activities on offer. Although George and Port Elizabeth Airports are both within 1 and 2.5 hours drive away and offer frequent domestic and select international flights, CemAir also restarted regular direct flights from Plettenberg Bay Aerodrome to Cape Town International Airport and Johannesburg&#x27;s OR Tambo Airport in 2014, enhancing accessibility by air.

<doc id="663896" wikidata="Q2859861" url="?curid=663896" title="Atlantic Europe">
<text>Atlantic Europe encompasses the western portion of Europe which borders the Atlantic Ocean. The term may refer to the idea of Atlantic Europe as a cultural unit and/or as a biogeographical region.

It comprises the British Isles (Great Britain and Ireland), Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, the central and northern regions of Portugal, northwestern and northern Spain (including Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Southern Basque Country, and some portions of Castile and León), the southwestern and western portion of France (Northern Basque Country), western Scandinavia as well as western and northern Germany.

Weather and overall physical conditions are relatively similar along this area (with the exception of parts of Scandinavia and the Baltic), resulting in similar landscapes with common endemic plant and animal species. From a strictly physical point of view most of the Atlantic European shoreline can be considered a single biogeographical region. Physical geographers label this biogeographical area as the &quot;European Atlantic Domain&quot;, part of the Euro-Siberian botanic region.

== Culture ==
=== Origins ===

The Atlantic Bronze Age is a cultural complex of the Bronze Age period of approximately 1300–700 BC, that marked the economic and cultural exchange between the current territories of Portugal, Spain, France, Great Britain and Ireland. During this time, tin from throughout Atlantic Europe was traded in the Mediterranean. Via the Bell Beaker culture, Atlantic and Central Europe were in close cultural contact from at least the mid 3rd millennium BC, contributing to what would emerge as the Celtic culture of the West/Central European Iron Age.

Archaeologists have noted that the prehistoric peoples of Atlantic Europe presented common traits, as shown by artifacts, artistic and architectural styles found in the region which attest to at least some form of trade and/or cultural link. In addition, a number of genetic studies seem to interrelate specific groups of population in parts of Atlantic Europe in contrast with, for example, Central or Mediterranean Europe.

Some examples of early cultural contact are the European Megalithic Culture and the Atlantic Bronze Age, or &quot;carp&#x27;s tongue sword complex&quot;. This refers to an industry mainly based on the west coast of France and Brittany but which clearly had links with societies in Iberia and Britain, as evidenced by products such as the carp&#x27;s tongue sword and the end winged axe, which were widely bought and sold along the routes of the Atlantic seaways.

Atlantic Europe is also a term often used in reference to the territory occupied by the Celtic-speaking peoples and Celtic influenced people of western Europe.

=== Culture at present ===

A number of authors have postulated that there still is a cultural continuum in Atlantic Europe, forming a cultural unit which has its roots in prehistoric times but remained until today mostly thanks to sea trade. Geographers also mention the influence of the natural environment in the construction of a similar cultural landscape along the western European coasts.

Some of the first geographers to consider this idea of Atlantic Europe were Otero Pedrayo and Orlando Ribeiro. Pedrayo stated in his studies about Galicia that this territory was marked by a strong &quot;Atlantic character&quot;, not Mediterranean, despite being part of a state often perceived as Mediterranean (Spain). On the other hand, while researching about his native Portugal, Ribeiro deepened the concepts of Atlantic Europe and Mediterranean Europe, linking southern Portugal more towards the Mediterranean culture and central and northern Portugal (together with Galicia and Asturias) to a pan-Atlantic European culture.

This idea would be further developed from the 1950s onwards by authors such as P. Flatrès, Emyr Estyn Evans, A. Bouhier, Meynier, J. García Fernández, Patrick O&#x27;Flanagan, Richard Bradley, Barry Cunliffe, Carlos Ferrás Sexto and Xoán Paredes, among others.

O&#x27;Flanagan, based on the theories of Pedrayo and Ribeiro, states that Atlantic Europe is a cultural reality that stretches along the coastal fringe of Europe, from Norway to South-Central Portugal (roughly down to the Santarém area), and including Britain and Ireland. With this in mind, Paredes affirms that there exists a cultural landscape common to Atlantic (namely Celtic) Europe, mainly based on the settlement pattern, use and shared perception of the lived space, thus evidencing in itself a social and cultural internal cohesion and continuity.

Bob Quinn in his documentary series &quot;Atlantean&quot; speculates that western European Celtic culture is actually an earlier, pre-Celtic, Atlantic culture that included Atlantic Europe and people of the Maghreb such as Berbers and that it continues today.

== Atlantic Europe in politics ==

There is a multi-national association of regions, which acts as a co-ordinator of Atlantic European regions and its interests. This is the &quot;Atlantic Arc Commission&quot;. Operative since 1989, it includes 26 regions from four member States - Great Britain, France, Spain and Portugal. The Atlantic Arc Commission is one of the seven &quot;Geographical Commissions in the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions of Europe&quot;.

== Genetics ==

The genetic link between the various Atlantic population is still under discussion. On the one hand, some studies show that modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North European populations, and not to southern Atlantic Europeans in Spain and France. However, as the authors acknowledge, the sample used is unlikely to include many members of smaller genetically isolated populations that exist within countries. On the other hand, an article published in the &quot;American Journal of Genetics&quot; indicates – after including samples from different regions within European countries – a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone, from northwest Iberia (Galicia) to western Scandinavia, that dates back to end of the last Ice Age.

<text>Thomas Campbell Eyton (10 September 1809 – 25 October 1880) was an English naturalist whose fields were cattle, fishes and birds. He was a friend and correspondent of Charles Darwin though he opposed his theories.

Eyton was born at Eyton Hall, near Wellington, Shropshire. He studied at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was a contemporary and friend of Charles Darwin.

After succeeding to the estate in 1855, Eyton built a large natural history museum at Eyton Hall that included a range of bird skins and skeletons, described as &quot;one of the finest in Europe&quot;. Besides Darwin, Eyton enjoyed some correspondence with other naturalists including Louis Agassiz, Asa Gray, and Alfred Russel Wallace.

Eyton published &quot;History of the Rarer British Birds&quot; (1836), &quot;A Monograph on the Anatidae, Or Duck Tribe&quot; (1838), &quot;A History of Oyster and Oyster Fisheries&quot; (1858) and &quot;Osteologia Avium&quot; (1871–78). He established in about 1842 the &quot;Herd Book of Hereford Cattle&quot;, which he edited until 1860

Eyton was married in 1835 to Elizabeth Frances Slaney, the eldest daughter and co-heiress of Robert Aglionby Slaney MP. She pre-deceased him by ten years.

He was a justice of the peace (JP) and a deputy lieutenant of Shropshire. He served in the South Salopian Yeomanry Cavalry, entering as cornet in 1830, and promoted lieutenant in 1838. He also played county level cricket for Shropshire between 1844 and 1854.

Eyton&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte Eyton was an amateur geologist, who wrote on the geology of the Wrekin.

==Archives==
A collection of letters sent to Eyton are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham. This archive collection also contains the correspondence of his father-in-law, Robert Aglionby Slaney, and other family members.

<doc id="663900" wikidata="Q233724" url="?curid=663900" title="Vanessa Ferlito">
<text>Vanessa Ferlito (born December 28, 1977) is an American actress. She is known for playing Detective Aiden Burn in the first two seasons of the CBS crime drama &quot;&quot;, as well as for her recurring portrayal of Claudia Hernandez in FOX drama &quot;24&quot;, and for her starring roles as FBI Agent Charlie DeMarco in the USA Network series &quot;Graceland&quot; and as Tammy Gregorio on the CBS crime drama series &quot;&quot;. 

She has also appeared in a number of films, including &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004), &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; (2005), &quot;Man of the House&quot; (2005), &quot;Gridiron Gang&quot; (2006), &quot;Death Proof&quot; (2007), &quot;Nothing like the Holidays&quot; (2008), &quot;Madea Goes to Jail&quot; (2009), &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot; (2009), &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; (2010), and &quot;Stand Up Guys&quot; (2012).

==Early life==
Vanessa Ferlito was born on December 28, 1977, in Brooklyn, New York City to an American-Italian family. She was raised by her mother and her stepfather, who owned a hair salon in Brooklyn. Her father died of a heroin overdose when she was two years old. She said of her youth in Brooklyn: &quot;I hung out with a rough crowd. And the neighborhood I grew up in was rough. We were scrappers. I fought my way through school.&quot;

She became a notable fixture in the late-night circuit in New York City, telling &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 1998: &quot;It’s like a job, going out – every night we’re trying to get people to introduce us to people. It’s all about who you know and what you do with it.&quot;

==Career==
Early in her career, Ferlito worked as a model for Wilhelmina Models. Ferlito developed acting aspirations early in her life and broke into the entertainment business through a series of guest spots and recurring roles.

In 2003, Ferlito starred as Lizette Sanchez in John Leguizamo&#x27;s boxing drama &quot;Undefeated&quot;, which earned her an NAACP nomination for Outstanding Actress in a TV movie. This was followed in 2004 by a role in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. In 2005 Ferlito appeared in Stephen Herek&#x27;s &quot;Man of the House&quot;, opposite Tommy Lee Jones, for which she received positive notice, with &quot;Variety&#x27;s&quot; Joe Leydon stating that &quot;Vanessa Ferlito is the standout, mainly because she&#x27;s the only one who gets enough to do to make a strong impression as a distinctive personality.&quot;

Ferlito was a series regular on the first two seasons (2004–2005) of CBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, as Aiden Burn, a member of the forensic investigation team led by Gary Sinise. Ferlito has also appeared in other television series, including HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Third Watch&quot;, and had a recurring role as Claudia in FOX&#x27;s series &quot;24&quot;.

After &quot;CSI: NY&quot;, Ferlito starred in several films, among them &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot;; Nora Ephron&#x27;s &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot; opposite Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci and Amy Adams; Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;Madea Goes to Jail&quot;; and Alfredo De Villa&#x27;s &quot;Nothing like the Holidays&quot; (originally titled &quot;Humboldt Park&quot;) with Alfred Molina, John Leguizamo and Jay Hernandez. Prior to these, Ferlito appeared in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Death Proof&quot; opposite Kurt Russell, a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Ferlito. She also appeared in Lee Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; with Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr.

In 2012, Ferlito was cast in the feature film, &quot;Stand Up Guys&quot;, opposite Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin. She also played Charlie DeMarco on USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot;, which ran between 2013 and 2015. In 2016, Ferlito was added to the cast of &quot;&quot; for the show&#x27;s third season, playing an FBI special agent who is sent from DC to investigate the NCIS team.

<doc id="663901" wikidata="Q6479149" url="?curid=663901" title="Lakeside Shopping Centre">
<text>Lakeside Shopping Centre (commonly referred to as Lakeside) is a large out-of-town shopping centre located in West Thurrock, Essex just beyond the eastern boundary of Greater London. It was constructed on the site of a former chalk quarry. The first tenants moved into the complex in 1988 and it was completed in 1990, being opened on 25 October of that year by Princess Alexandra of Kent, Marcus Bradford and Angus Ogilvy. New spaces in the red car park were added as recently as October 2019.

The shopping centre, in addition to the retail parks, forms one of the largest shopping areas in a single location within Europe, with almost of retail space on a site of . The community of Chafford Hundred has grown to the east of the centre since its opening. Its main rival is the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Greenhithe, Kent, just across the River Thames.

The centre was rebranded as &quot;Intu Lakeside&quot; in 2013, following the renaming of parent Capital Shopping Centres as Intu.

The centre was sold in 2020, after Intu went into administration. In November 2020, Lakeside was taken over by Savills and was renamed &quot;Lakeside Shopping Centre&quot;.

Lakeside has been described as being Thurrock&#x27;s &quot;de facto town centre&quot;. Thurrock Council wants to make it a &quot;regional town centre&quot;, with plans to build new shops, facilities and 3,000 homes. A road linking it to the nearby Lakeside Basin will also be built.
On 7 July 2024, a fire occurred there. 

The lake next to lakeside shopping centre is called “Alexandra lake”. There is an island on the lake called “Francesco Island”. There is a footpath around the lake with is a great natural walk. 

==Main shopping centre==
The shopping centre is the eleventh largest in Britain with available as retail floorspace - the MetroCentre in Gateshead, after its expansion in 2004, is the largest. There are over 250 shops (including the anchor stores of Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark - Debenhams and House of Fraser were also anchor stores until their closures in May 2021 and January 2024 respectively), 50 cafes and restaurants, and a lake named Alexandra Lake with a PADI certified diving school complex. Lakeside has on average 500,000 visitors per week.

It is currently open on weekdays from 10:00 to 21:00, and on Saturday from 09:00 to 21:00, and Sunday from 11:00 to 17:00. Intu have constantly rebuffed the rumours that circulate online about the presence of 3 &quot;golden parking spaces&quot;; apparently if you manage to find and park on one of these you get a free day&#x27;s shopping, and half price coffee at all the food outlets. The centre&#x27;s car parks have capacity for 11,857 cars.

Following Intu Properties plc entering administration in June 2020, a subsidiary of the company called Intu SGS received funding to take full control of the centre along with Braehead, Victoria Centre and Intu Watford. The transfer from Intu to Intu SGS is expected to take place by the end of 2020, and will involve Global Mutual becoming asset manager of the centres and Savills serving as property manager.

==Transport connections==

The centre has a direct link to Chafford Hundred railway station where c2c trains run to London Fenchurch Street via Upminster and West Ham or east towards Southend Central via Grays and Stanford-le-Hope.

The centre is connected to the M25 motorway which is London&#x27;s outermost ring road running south towards Dartford and Gatwick and North towards Enfield, Watford and Heathrow. As well as the M25 the centre is connected to the A13 road which connects central and east London to Basildon and Southend-on-Sea.

It is connected to the Transport for London bus network by 370 to Romford and 372 to Hornchurch with other operators such as Ensignbus to the surrounding Thurrock area and First Essex&#x27;s route 100 to Basildon. Route X80 operated by Ensignbus provides a link to Bluewater across the Dartford Crossing.

==New developments==

To ensure the centre maintains its competition with the newer (and what is perceived by some as more &#x27;upmarket&#x27;) Bluewater shopping centre, which lies just over the Thames in Greenhithe, Lakeside had a £30 million refurbishment in 2004. This included new Italian porcelain flooring, new lighting, a new ceiling and new glass roofs which allow much more natural light into the shopping centre. There are now also new, faster lifts, and four more escalators, along with automatic entrance doors. The refurbishment has also encouraged refitting of many shops so that they complement the new surroundings. In September 2005, Next opened an . extension to its store.

The Lakeside Pavilion, a market area adjoining the main shopping centre via a covered bridge, was closed in 2006 for refurbishment, re-opening in June 2007 as &#x27;The Boardwalk&#x27;. The Boardwalk provides an additional . of retail space for eleven new restaurants along with more retail and leisure space, as well as a 10-metre boardwalk, offering external seating overlooking Alexandra Lake. The Old Orleans bar and restaurant, a converted paddle steamer, was also refurbished and re-opened on the same day, with new features including a rooftop bar. Later a Miller &amp; Carter restaurant, this partially sank on 23 December 2022.

Vue cinema formed part of the old Lakeside Pavilion, with a seven screen cinema. This closed on 11 January 2007 to be refurbished, and was re-opened on 15 June 2007; the refurbishment resulted in nine state-of-the-art screens with stadium seating. &#x27;Gold Class&#x27;, a premium screen that housed luxury seating, has since been abandoned in favour of VIP seating sections in every screen. The &#x27;Evolution Screen&#x27;, with a combination of giant bean bag chairs amongst VIP seating, was the first of its kind in the UK.

Apple opened its tenth UK store at Lakeside Shopping Centre.

Marks &amp; Spencer, one of the centre&#x27;s four anchor stores, applied for planning permission in July 2008 to allow construction of a third storey extension to their store, in addition to an extensive refurbishment of the store layout and customer facilities. The application was approved at the end of October 2008 although no construction has taken place as of July 2011.

Superdry brands opened its largest-ever store at the centre in July 2010, in the unit previously occupied by Woolworths. Ed&#x27;s Easy Diner also opened their fifth restaurant in the centre&#x27;s food court in July 2010.

Taco Bell re-entered the UK market in June 2010 with the opening of its first stores at intu Lakeside.

On 8 December 2012, US fashion giant Forever 21 opened a flagship store at intu Lakeside, in a three-floor unit. In July 2016 this store closed down, with H&amp;M moving in to the store in December 2016.

Intu Lakeside was granted permission in 2012 to extend to include 30-40 new stores, a new footbridge across the Alexandra Lake to the Lakeside Retail Park, a new leisure area, a new 80 bed Travelodge hotel overlooking the river and a brand new transport hub where the current railway station bridge is to allow easier interchange. The new 225,000 sq ft leisure area was completed in early 2019 and will include a Nickelodeon-branded entertainment centre.

In spring 2022 it was announced that Marks and Spencer would relocate from their longstanding position in the centre of the mall to take over the premises vacated a year earlier by the closure of Debenhams.

On 20 October 2023 it was announced that the House of Fraser store would be closing on 30 December 2023. Next will be relocating to this unit in Spring 2025.

==Docusoap==
In 1998, &quot;Lakesiders&quot; was a BBC docusoap narrated by Pauline Quirke following the activities of management including centre manager Richard Belt, shopkeepers and staff of the shopping centre. The fractious working relationship between Essex FM&#x27;s breakfast show DJ Martin Day and his boss Paul Chantler also featured. The theme music was by Simon May.
A new series, &quot;Return to Lakesiders&quot;, was filmed by the BBC in 2007 and was broadcast on BBC Two 18–22 August 2008.

<doc id="663902" wikidata="Q1461820" url="?curid=663902" title="Consensus theory of truth">
<text>A consensus theory of truth is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them.

==Varieties of consensus==
===Consensus gentium===

An ancient criterion of truth, the &quot;consensus gentium&quot; (Latin for &quot;agreement of the people&quot;), states &quot;that which is universal among men carries the weight of truth&quot; (Ferm, 64). A number of consensus theories of truth are based on variations of this principle. In some criteria the notion of universal consent is taken strictly, while others qualify the terms of consensus in various ways. There are versions of consensus theory in which the specific population weighing in on a given question, the proportion of the population required for consent, and the period of time needed to declare consensus vary from the classical norm.

===Consensus as a regulative ideal===

A &quot;descriptive theory&quot; is one that tells how things are, while a &quot;normative theory&quot; tells how things ought to be. Expressed in practical terms, a normative theory, more properly called a &quot;policy&quot;, tells agents how they ought to act. A policy can be an absolute imperative, telling agents how they ought to act in any case, or it can be a contingent directive, telling agents how they ought to act &quot;if&quot; they want to achieve a particular goal. A policy is frequently stated in the form of a piece of advice called a &quot;heuristic&quot;, a &quot;maxim&quot;, a &quot;norm&quot;, a &quot;rule&quot;, a &quot;slogan&quot;, and so on. Other names for a policy are a &quot;recommendation&quot; and a &quot;regulative principle&quot;.

A regulative ideal can be expressed in the form of a description, but what it describes is an ideal state of affairs, a condition of being that constitutes its aim, end, goal, intention, or objective. It is not the usual case for the actual case to be the ideal case, or else there would hardly be much call for a policy aimed at achieving an ideal.

Corresponding to the distinction between actual conditions and ideal conditions there is a distinction between actual consensus and ideal consensus. A theory of truth founded on a notion of actual consensus is a very different thing from a theory of truth founded on a notion of ideal consensus. Moreover, an ideal consensus may be ideal in several different ways. The state of consensus may be ideal in its own nature, conceived in the matrix of actual experience by way of intellectual operations like abstraction, extrapolation, and limit formation. Or the conditions under which the consensus is conceived to be possible may be formulated as idealizations of actual conditions. A very common type of ideal consensus theory refers to a community that is an idealization of actual communities in one or more respects.

==Critiques==
It is very difficult to find any philosopher of note who asserts a &quot;bare&quot;, &quot;naive&quot;, or &quot;pure&quot; consensus theory of truth, in other words, a treatment of truth that is based on actual consensus in an actual community without further qualification. One obvious critique is that not everyone agrees to consensus theory, implying that it may not be true by its own criteria. Another problem is defining how we know that consensus is achieved without falling prey to an infinite regress. Even if everyone agrees to a particular proposition, we may not know that it is true until everyone agrees that everyone agrees to it. Bare consensus theories are frequent topics of discussion, however, evidently because they serve the function of reference points for the discussion of alternative theories.

If consensus equals truth, then truth can be made by forcing or organizing a consensus, rather than being discovered through experiment or observation, or existing separately from consensus. The principles of mathematics also do not hold under consensus truth because mathematical propositions build on each other. If the consensus declared 2+2=5 it would render the practice of mathematics where 2+2=4 impossible.

Imre Lakatos characterizes it as a &quot;watered down&quot; form of provable truth propounded by some sociologists of knowledge, particularly Thomas Kuhn and Michael Polanyi.

Philosopher Nigel Warburton argues that the truth by consensus process is not reliable, general agreement upon something does not make it true. Warburton says that one reason for the unreliability of the consensus theory of truth, is that people are gullible, easily misled, and prone to wishful thinkingthey believe an assertion and espouse it as truth in the face of overwhelming evidence and facts to the contrary, simply because they wish that things were so.

<doc id="663903" wikidata="Q3234176" url="?curid=663903" title="Behind the Music">
<text>Behind the Music is an American documentary television series that initially aired on VH1 from 1997 to 2014 and has streamed on Paramount+ since July 2021. Each episode profiles and interviews a popular musical artist or group, examining career beginnings, roads to success and any resultant hardships.

==Premise==
Each show focuses on a musician or musical group, documenting both the successes of the musicians and the problems they faced during their careers. Except for the first two episodes (which focused on Milli Vanilli and M.C. Hammer), all programs are narrated by Jim Forbes. Forbes was later used to narrate the Milli Vanilli episode when it was modified to include the death of Rob Pilatus. The UK airings of the episodes focusing on Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith and Genesis were narrated by Mary Anne Hobbs while Forbes narrated the US airings.

VH1&#x27;s criterion for choosing the musicians who appear on the show is, in many cases, to profile those who are no longer in the music industry, or were moderately significant in rock history (although many are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame such as Neil Diamond, The Police, Metallica, AC/DC, Aerosmith among others). This is different to VH1&#x27;s other biography show, &quot;VH1&#x27;s Legends&quot;, which profiles musicians who were very significant to the industry. Some artists were profiled on &quot;Behind The Music&quot; and &quot;Legends&quot;, including Tina Turner, Elton John, Keith Moon, and John Lennon (&quot;Behind The Music&quot; exclusively focused on the months before his 1980 murder).

==Origins==
While being interviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in October 2000, co-creator and executive producer Gay Rosenthal explained &quot;Jeff Gaspin, who&#x27;s the executive vice president of VH1, and I were at lunch, and we said, &#x27;Whatever happened to Milli Vanilli?&#x27; I said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know, but why don&#x27;t you let me take the ball and run with it, and let me see what I can find out?&#x27; Milli Vanilli was hard. Nobody knew where they were. I had to be a private eye. I got a list of addresses where Fabrice had lived and sent letters to every address. Two weeks later, I got a call from Fabrice&#x27;s manager. And then I spent a good two months with them – having dinner, having them at my house – before they agreed to do it. They didn&#x27;t know if they wanted to relive the story, but I said, &#x27;Listen, no one has heard your story from you. This will be a great opportunity to set the record straight.&#x27;&quot; &quot;When we saw it in the edit room, we thought we had something special. The stories were working, and the series was green-lit.&quot; Rosenthal later stated in an August 1999 interview with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;.

==Spin-offs and revival==
Another episode of &quot;Behind the Music&quot; on KISS was re-christened &quot;KISS: Beyond the Makeup&quot; in July 2001 (which was two hours in length). This featured Matt Pinfield, formerly of MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, as narrator instead of Jim Forbes.

In June, 2000, VH1 aired the BBC produced Behind the Music like program on Pink Floyd entitled &quot;Behind The Wall&quot; which coincided with the release of &quot;Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81&quot; and focused on the making of &quot;The Wall&quot;, concerts that went with it and &quot;Pink Floyd The Wall&quot; film and had interviews with the band members and it featured no narration.

A short-lived half-hour spin-off series titled &quot;BTM2&quot; (short for &quot;Behind the Music 2&quot;), chronicled the careers of newer upcoming artists.

The spin-off &quot;Behind the Music: Remastered&quot; that aired on VH1 Classic updates the original version of the &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episodes with new interviews, footage, and the later half of the artist&#x27;s career. The series also included two original episodes on Motörhead and Deep Purple.

In September 2020, a spin-off known as &quot;MTV&#x27;s Behind the Music: The Top 40&quot; was announced for Paramount+, which was to feature a countdown of the 40 &quot;biggest artists of all-time&quot;. In March 2021, it was revealed via a promo aired during the Grammy Awards that the spin-off would instead be positioned as a full reboot of &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, seven years after the last episode had aired on July 16, 2014. In May 2021, it was announced that the revival would premiere on July 29, 2021, with two episodes. Similar to the original series and &quot;Behind the Music: Remastered&quot;, it includes both new episodes and updated versions of past ones.

<doc id="663904" wikidata="Q7237641" url="?curid=663904" title="Pragmatic theory of truth">
<text>A pragmatic theory of truth is a theory of truth within the philosophies of pragmatism and pragmaticism. Pragmatic theories of truth were first posited by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. The common features of these theories are a reliance on the &quot;pragmatic maxim&quot; as a means of clarifying the meanings of difficult concepts such as &quot;truth&quot;; and an emphasis on the fact that &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;certainty&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;, or &quot;truth&quot; is the result of an inquiry.

==Background==

Pragmatic theories of truth developed from the earlier ideas of ancient philosophy, the Scholastics. Pragmatic ideas about truth are often confused with the quite distinct notions of &quot;logic and inquiry&quot;, &quot;judging what is true&quot;, and &quot;truth predicates&quot;.

===Logic and inquiry===

In one classical formulation, truth is defined as the good of logic, where logic is a normative science, that is, an inquiry into a &quot;good&quot; or a &quot;value&quot; that seeks knowledge of it and the means to achieve it. In this view, truth cannot be discussed to much effect outside the context of inquiry, knowledge, and logic, all very broadly considered.

Most inquiries into the character of truth begin with a notion of an informative, meaningful, or significant element, the truth of whose information, meaning, or significance may be put into question and needs to be evaluated. Depending on the context, this element might be called an &quot;artefact&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;impression&quot;, &quot;lyric&quot;, &quot;mark&quot;, &quot;performance&quot;, &quot;picture&quot;, &quot;sentence&quot;, &quot;sign&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;token&quot;, &quot;utterance&quot;, &quot;word&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, and so on. Whatever the case, one has the task of judging whether the bearers of information, meaning, or significance are indeed truth-bearers. This judgment is typically expressed in the form of a specific &quot;truth predicate&quot;, whose positive application to a sign, or so on, asserts that the sign is true.

===Truth predicates===

Theories of truth may be described according to several dimensions of description that affect the character of the predicate &quot;true&quot;. The truth predicates that are used in different theories may be classified by the number of things that have to be mentioned in order to assess the truth of a sign, counting the sign itself as the first thing.

In formal logic, this number is called the &quot;arity&quot; of the predicate. The kinds of truth predicates may then be subdivided according to any number of more specific characters that various theorists recognize as important.

# A &quot;monadic&quot; truth predicate is one that applies to its main subject — typically a concrete representation or its abstract content — independently of reference to anything else. In this case one can say that a truthbearer is true in and of itself.
# A &quot;dyadic&quot; truth predicate is one that applies to its main subject only in reference to something else, a second subject. Most commonly, the auxiliary subject is either an &quot;object&quot;, an &quot;interpreter&quot;, or a &quot;language&quot; to which the representation bears some relation.
# A &quot;triadic&quot; truth predicate is one that applies to its main subject only in reference to a second and a third subject. For example, in a pragmatic theory of truth, one has to specify both the object of the sign, and either its interpreter or another sign called the &quot;interpretant&quot; before one can say that the sign is true &quot;of&quot; its object &quot;to&quot; its interpreting agent or sign.

Several qualifications must be kept in mind with respect to any such radically simple scheme of classification, as real practice seldom presents any pure types, and there are settings in which it is useful to speak of a theory of truth that is &quot;almost&quot; &quot;k&quot;-adic, or that &quot;would be&quot; &quot;k&quot;-adic if certain details can be abstracted away and neglected in a particular context of discussion. That said, given the generic division of truth predicates according to their arity, further species can be differentiated within each genus according to a number of more refined features.

The truth predicate of interest in a typical correspondence theory of truth tells of a relation between representations and objective states of affairs, and is therefore expressed, for the most part, by a dyadic predicate. In general terms, one says that a representation is &quot;true of&quot; an objective situation, more briefly, that a sign is true of an object. The nature of the correspondence may vary from theory to theory in this family. The correspondence can be fairly arbitrary or it can take on the character of an &quot;analogy&quot;, an &quot;icon&quot;, or a &quot;morphism&quot;, whereby a representation is rendered true of its object by the existence of corresponding elements and a similar structure.

==Peirce==
Very little in Peirce&#x27;s thought can be understood in its proper light without understanding that he thinks all thoughts are signs, and thus, according to his theory of thought, no thought is understandable outside the context of a sign relation. Sign relations taken collectively are the subject matter of a theory of signs. So Peirce&#x27;s &quot;semiotic&quot;, his theory of sign relations, is key to understanding his entire philosophy of pragmatic thinking and thought.

In his contribution to the article &quot;Truth and Falsity and Error&quot; for Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology&quot; (1901), Peirce defines truth in the following way:
Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth. (Peirce 1901, see &quot;Collected Papers&quot; (CP) 5.565).
This statement emphasizes Peirce&#x27;s view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as &quot;fallibilism&quot; and &quot;reference to the future&quot;, are essential to a proper conception of truth. Although Peirce occasionally uses words like &quot;concordance&quot; and &quot;correspondence&quot; to describe one aspect of the pragmatic sign relation, he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than &quot;nominal&quot; definitions, which he follows long tradition in relegating to a lower status than &quot;real&quot; definitions.
That truth is the correspondence of a representation with its object is, as Kant says, merely the nominal definition of it. Truth belongs exclusively to propositions. A proposition has a subject (or set of subjects) and a predicate. The subject is a sign; the predicate is a sign; and the proposition is a sign that the predicate is a sign of that of which the subject is a sign. If it be so, it is true. But what does this correspondence or reference of the sign, to its object, consist in? (Peirce 1906, CP 5.553).
Here Peirce makes a statement that is decisive for understanding the relationship between his pragmatic definition of truth and any theory of truth that leaves it solely and simply a matter of representations corresponding with their objects. Peirce, like Kant before him, recognizes Aristotle&#x27;s distinction between a &quot;nominal definition&quot;, a definition in name only, and a &quot;real definition&quot;, one that states the function of the concept, the reason for conceiving it, and so indicates the &quot;essence&quot;, the underlying &quot;substance&quot; of its object. This tells us the sense in which Peirce entertained a &quot;correspondence theory of truth&quot;, namely, a purely nominal sense. To get beneath the superficiality of the nominal definition it is necessary to analyze the notion of correspondence in greater depth.

In preparing for this task, Peirce makes use of an allegorical story, omitted here, the moral of which is that there is no use seeking a conception of truth that we cannot conceive ourselves being able to capture in a humanly conceivable concept. So we might as well proceed on the assumption that we have a real hope of comprehending the answer, of being able to &quot;handle the truth&quot; when the time comes. Bearing that in mind, the problem of defining truth reduces to the following form:
Now thought is of the nature of a sign. In that case, then, if we can find out the right method of thinking and can follow it out — the right method of transforming signs — then truth can be nothing more nor less than the last result to which the following out of this method would ultimately carry us. In that case, that to which the representation should conform, is itself something in the nature of a representation, or sign — something noumenal, intelligible, conceivable, and utterly unlike a thing-in-itself. (Peirce 1906, CP 5.553).
Peirce&#x27;s theory of truth depends on two other, intimately related subject matters, his theory of &quot;sign relations&quot; and his theory of &quot;inquiry&quot;. Inquiry is a special case of &quot;semiosis&quot;, a process that transforms signs into signs while maintaining a specific relationship to an object, which object may be located outside the trajectory of signs or else be found at the end of it. Inquiry includes all forms of belief revision and logical inference, including &quot;scientific method&quot;, what Peirce here means by &quot;the right method of transforming signs&quot;. A sign-to-sign transaction relating to an object is a transaction that involves three parties, or a relation that involves three roles. This is called a &quot;ternary or triadic relation&quot; in logic. Consequently, pragmatic theories of truth are largely expressed in terms of triadic truth predicates.

The statement above tells us one more thing: Peirce, having started out in accord with Kant, is here giving notice that he is parting ways with the Kantian idea that the ultimate object of a representation is an unknowable &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;. Peirce would say that the object is knowable, in fact, it is known in the form of its representation, however imperfectly or partially.

&quot;Reality&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; are coordinate concepts in pragmatic thinking, each being defined in relation to the other, and both together as they participate in the time evolution of inquiry. Inquiry is not a disembodied process, nor the occupation of a singular individual, but the common life of an unbounded community.
The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you. Thus, the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a COMMUNITY, without definite limits, and capable of a definite increase of knowledge. (Peirce 1868, CP 5.311).

Different minds may set out with the most antagonistic views, but the progress of investigation carries them by a force outside of themselves to one and the same conclusion. This activity of thought by which we are carried, not where we wish, but to a foreordained goal, is like the operation of destiny. No modification of the point of view taken, no selection of other facts for study, no natural bent of mind even, can enable a man to escape the predestinate opinion. This great law is embodied in the conception of truth and reality. The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real. That is the way I would explain reality. (Peirce 1878, CP 5.407).
==James==
William James&#x27;s version of the pragmatic theory is often summarized by his statement that &quot;the &#x27;true&#x27; is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the &#x27;right&#x27; is only the expedient in our way of behaving.&quot; By this, James meant that truth is a quality the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to actual practice (thus, &quot;pragmatic&quot;). James&#x27;s pragmatic theory is a synthesis of correspondence theory of truth and coherence theory of truth, with an added dimension. Truth is verifiable to the extent that thoughts and statements correspond with actual things, as well as &quot;hangs together,&quot; or coheres, fits as pieces of a puzzle might fit together, and these are in turn verified by the observed results of the application of an idea to actual practice. James said that &quot;all true processes must lead to the face of directly verifying sensible experiences somewhere.&quot; He also extended his pragmatic theory well beyond the scope of scientific verifiability, and even into the realm of the mystical: &quot;On pragmatic principles, if the hypothesis of God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, then it is &#x27;true.&#x27; &quot;
&quot;Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their &#x27;agreement&#x27;, as falsity means their disagreement, with &#x27;reality&#x27;. Pragmatists and intellectualists both accept this definition as a matter of course. They begin to quarrel only after the question is raised as to what may precisely be meant by the term &#x27;agreement&#x27;, and what by the term &#x27;reality&#x27;, when reality is taken as something for our ideas to agree with.&quot;
Pragmatism, James clarifies, is not a new philosophy. He states that it instead focuses on discerning truth between contrasting schools of thought. “To understand truth, he argues, we must consider the pragmatic ‘cash-value’ of having true beliefs and the practical difference of having true ideas.&quot; By using the term ‘cash-value,’ James refers to the practical consequences that come from discerning the truth behind arguments, through the pragmatic method, that should yield no desirable answer. In such cases, the pragmatic method must “try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences.&quot; William James uses an analogy of a squirrel on a tree to further explain the pragmatic method.

James imagines a squirrel on a tree. If it clung to one side of the tree, and a person stood on the other, and as the person walked around the tree so too did the squirrel as to never be seen by the person, would the person rightly be walking around the squirrel? “’Depends on what you practically mean by ‘going round’ the squirrel. If you mean passing from the north of him to the east, then to the south, then to the west, then to the north of him again, obviously the man does go round him… but on the contrary if you mean being first in front of him, then behind him, then on his left, then finally in front again, it is quite obvious that the man fails to go round him.&quot; In such arguments, where no practical consequences can be found after making a distinction, the argument should be dropped. If, however, the argument was to yield one result which clearly holds greater consequences, then that side should be agreed upon solely for its intrinsic value. Although James never actually clarifies what “practical consequences” are, he does mention how the best way to find division between possible consequences is by first practically defining what each side of the argument means. In terms of James’s example, he says: “You are both right and both wrong according as you conceive the verb ‘to go round’ in one practical fashion or the other.&quot; Thus the pragmatic theory seeks to find truth through the division and practical consequences between contrasting sides to establish which side is correct. 

William James (1907) begins his chapter on &quot;Pragmatism&#x27;s Conception of Truth&quot; in much the same letter and spirit as the above selection from Peirce (1906), noting the nominal definition of truth as a plausible point of departure, but immediately observing that the pragmatist&#x27;s quest for the meaning of truth can only begin, not end there.
&quot;The popular notion is that a true idea must copy its reality. Like other popular views, this one follows the analogy of the most usual experience. Our true ideas of sensible things do indeed copy them. Shut your eyes and think of yonder clock on the wall, and you get just such a true picture or copy of its dial. But your idea of its &#x27;works&#x27; (unless you are a clockmaker) is much less of a copy, yet it passes muster, for it in no way clashes with reality. Even though it should shrink to the mere word &#x27;works&#x27;, that word still serves you truly; and when you speak of the &#x27;time-keeping function&#x27; of the clock, or of its spring&#x27;s &#x27;elasticity&#x27;, it is hard to see exactly what your ideas can copy.&quot;
James exhibits a knack for popular expression that Peirce seldom sought, and here his analysis of correspondence by way of a simple thought experiment cuts right to the quick of the first major question to ask about it, namely: To what extent is the notion of correspondence involved in truth covered by the ideas of analogues, copies, or iconic images of the thing represented? The answer is that the iconic aspect of correspondence can be taken literally only in regard to sensory experiences of the more precisely eidetic sort. When it comes to the kind of correspondence that might be said to exist between a symbol, a word like &quot;works&quot;, and its object, the springs and catches of the clock on the wall, then the pragmatist recognizes that a more than nominal account of the matter still has a lot more explaining to do.

===Making truth===
Instead of truth being ready-made for us, James asserts we and reality jointly &quot;make&quot; truth. This idea has two senses: (1) truth is mutable, (often attributed to William James and F.C.S. Schiller); and (2) truth is relative to a conceptual scheme (more widely accepted in Pragmatism).

(1) Mutability of truth

&quot;Truth&quot; is not readily defined in Pragmatism. Can beliefs pass from being &quot;true&quot; to being &quot;untrue&quot; and back? For James, beliefs are not true until they have been made true by verification. James believed propositions become true over the long term through proving their utility in a person&#x27;s specific situation. The opposite of this process is not falsification, but rather the belief ceases to be a &quot;live option.&quot; F.C.S. Schiller, on the other hand, clearly asserted beliefs could pass into and out of truth on a situational basis. Schiller held that truth was relative to specific problems. If I want to know how to return home safely, the true answer will be whatever is useful to solving that problem. Later on, when faced with a different problem, what I came to believe with the earlier problem may now be false. As my problems change, and as the most useful way to solve a problem shifts, so does the property of truth.

C.S. Peirce considered the idea that beliefs are true at one time but false at another (or true for one person but false for another) to be one of the &quot;seeds of death&quot; by which James allowed his pragmatism to become &quot;infected.&quot; For Peirce the pragmatic view implies theoretical claims should be tied to verification processes (i.e. they should be subject to test). They shouldn&#x27;t be tied to our specific problems or life needs. Truth is defined, for Peirce, as what &quot;would&quot; be the ultimate outcome (not any outcome in real time) of inquiry by a (usually scientific) community of investigators. William James, while agreeing with this definition, also characterized truthfulness as a species of the good: if something is true it is trustworthy and reliable and will remain so in every conceivable situation. Both Peirce and Dewey connect the definitions of truth and &quot;warranted assertability&quot;. Hilary Putnam also developed his internal realism around the idea a belief is true if it is ideally justified in epistemic terms. About James&#x27; and Schiller&#x27;s view, Putnam says:

Rorty has also weighed in against James and Schiller:

(2) Conceptual relativity

With James and Schiller we make things true by verifying them—a view rejected by most pragmatists. However, nearly all pragmatists do accept the idea there can be no truths without a conceptual scheme to express those truths. That is,

F.C.S. Schiller used the analogy of a chair to make clear what he meant by the phrase that truth is made: just as a carpenter &quot;makes&quot; a chair out of existing materials and doesn&#x27;t &quot;create&quot; it out of nothing, truth is a transformation of our experience—but this doesn&#x27;t imply reality is something we&#x27;re free to construct or imagine as we please.

==Dewey==
John Dewey, less broadly than William James but much more broadly than Charles Peirce, held that inquiry, whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time &quot;if&quot; openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths. In his &quot;Logic: The Theory of Inquiry&quot; (1938), Dewey gave the following definition of inquiry:
Inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole. (Dewey, p. 108).
The index of the same book has exactly one entry under the heading &quot;truth&quot;, and it refers to the following footnote:
The best definition of &quot;truth&quot; from the logical standpoint which is known to me is that by Peirce: &quot;The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real [CP 5.407]. (Dewey, 343 &quot;n&quot;).
Dewey says more of what he understands by &quot;truth&quot; in terms of his preferred concept of &quot;warranted assertibility&quot; as the end-in-view and conclusion of inquiry (Dewey, 14–15).

==Mead==

==Criticisms==
Several objections are commonly made to pragmatist account of truth, of either sort.

First, due originally to Bertrand Russell (1907) in a discussion of James&#x27;s theory, is that pragmatism mixes up the notion of truth with &quot;epistemology&quot;. Pragmatism describes an &quot;indicator&quot; or a &quot;sign&quot; of truth. It really cannot be regarded as a theory of the &quot;meaning&quot; of the word &quot;true&quot;. There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;stating an indicator&quot; and &quot;giving the meaning&quot;. For example, when the streetlights turn on at the end of a day, that&#x27;s an , a sign, that evening is coming on. It would be an obvious mistake to say that the word &quot;evening&quot; just means &quot;the time that the streetlights turn on&quot;. In the same way, while it might be an &quot;indicator&quot; of truth, that a proposition is part of that perfect science at the ideal limit of inquiry, that just isn&#x27;t what &quot;true&quot; &quot;means&quot;.

Russell&#x27;s objection is that pragmatism mixes up an &quot;indicator&quot; of truth with the &quot;meaning&quot; of the predicate &#x27;true&#x27;. There is a difference between the two and pragmatism confuses them. In this pragmatism is akin to Berkeley&#x27;s view that to be is to be perceived, which similarly confuses an indication or proof of that something exists with the meaning of the word &#x27;exists&#x27;, or with what it is for something to exist.

Other objections to pragmatism include how we define what it means to say a belief &quot;works&quot;, or that it is &quot;useful to believe&quot;. The vague usage of these terms, first popularized by James, has led to much debate.

A viable, more sophisticated consensus theory of truth, a mixture of Peircean theory with speech-act theory and social theory, is that presented and defended by Jürgen Habermas, which sets out the universal pragmatic conditions of ideal consensus and responds to many objections to earlier versions of a pragmatic, consensus theory of truth. Habermas distinguishes explicitly between factual consensus, i.e. the beliefs that happen to hold in a particular community, and rational consensus, i.e. consensus attained in conditions approximating an &quot;ideal speech situation&quot;, in which inquirers or members of a community suspend or bracket prevailing beliefs and engage in rational discourse aimed at truth and governed by the force of the better argument, under conditions in which all participants in discourse have equal opportunities to engage in constative (assertions of fact), normative, and expressive speech acts, and in which discourse is not distorted by the of power or the internalization of systematic blocks to communication.

Recent Peirceans, Cheryl Misak, and Robert B. Talisse have attempted to formulate Peirce&#x27;s theory of truth in a way that improves on Habermas and provides an epistemological conception of deliberative democracy.

<text>QinetiQ ( as in &quot;kinetic&quot;) is a multinational defence technology company headquartered in Farnborough, Hampshire. It operates primarily in the defence, security and critical national infrastructure markets and run testing and evaluation capabilities for air, land, sea and target systems. 

As a private entity, QinetiQ was created in April 2001; prior to this its assets had been part of Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), a now-defunct British government organisation. While a large portion of DERA&#x27;s assets, sites, and employees were transferred to QinetiQ, other elements were incorporated into Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which remains in government ownership. Some former DERA locations have thus become key sites for QinetiQ. These include Farnborough, Hampshire; MoD Boscombe Down, Wiltshire; and Malvern, Worcestershire.

In February 2006, QinetiQ was floated on the London Stock Exchange. The privatisation process was subject to an inquiry by the UK&#x27;s National Audit Office, which was critical of the generous incentive scheme available to the company&#x27;s management. QinetiQ has completed numerous acquisitions of defence- and technology-related companies, primarily those that are based in the United States, and is a trusted supplier to the US government. QinetiQ USA operates under a Special Security Arrangement which allows it to work independently and separately on some of the most sensitive United States defense programs despite its foreign ownership. It has also spun off some of its technologies into new companies, such as Omni-ID Ltd. It is currently a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==Name==
&quot;QinetiQ&quot; is an invented name. &quot;Qi&quot; is supposed to reflect the company&#x27;s energy, &quot;net&quot; its networking ability, and &quot;iq&quot; its intellectual resources. The name was adopted in early 2001 as a marker of Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) privatisation; the rebranding reportedly cost £400,000.

==History==

===Creation and early years===
In early 2001, defence minister Lewis Moonie announced the creation of QinetiQ via the privatisation of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). At the time, Moonie stated that the entity would remain a British business, being based in the UK, and that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) would retain a &#x27;special share&#x27; in the company, while safeguards would be in place to prevent conflicts of interest.

By April 2002, while QinetiQ had taken steps to operate on a commercial basis and saw third parties as its key growth area, 80% of its annual sales was reportedly being derived from the UK MoD. It was observed that QinetiQ&#x27;s close relationship with the MoD gave it a competitive edge over most private-sector rivals.

Initially, QinetiQ was entirely owned by the British government; it was planned for a stock market flotation of the firm to be conducted sometime during 2002. However, this flotation was postponed; according to aerospace industry periodical Flight International, a lack of investor confidence was the principal reason for the delay.

In late 2002, the Carlyle Group, an American private equity firm, publicly declared its intention to purchase a large stake in QinetiQ. In February 2003, the Carlyle Group completed the acquisition of a 33.8% share for £42 million. Prior to QinetiQ&#x27;s flotation years later, ownership of the firm was divided between the MoD (56%), Carlyle Group (31%) and staff (13%). The Carlyle Group was expected to remain invested in QinetiQ for between three and five years, after which a stock exchange float would take place.

In September 2004, QinetiQ acquired the US defence companies &quot;Westar Corporation&quot; and &quot;Foster-Miller&quot;, maker of the Talon robot. Also in 2004, it acquired &quot;HVR Consulting Services&quot; a leading UK-based engineering consultancy.

In early August 2005, the company announced it would acquire &quot;Apogen Technologies, Inc.&quot;, pending regulatory approval; according to QinetiQ&#x27;s website, the purchase came at a cost of $288.0m (£162.7m). In September 2005, the company acquired a 90% share of &quot;Verhaert Design and Development NV&quot; (VDD), a Belgian space systems integrator. In October that year, it acquired Broadreach Networks Limited, a supplier of Wi-Fi internet equipment to the European rail industry, and in February 2006, it bought Graphics Research Corporation Ltd, developer of the Paramarine software suite of ship and submarine design tools.

===Stock exchange listing===
On 12 January 2006, an announcement was made in Parliament by John Reid, Secretary of State for Defence, regarding the pending floatation of QinetiQ. Reid stated that the Carlyle Group &#x27;will continue to retain a significant stake in the company&#x27;, and that the government would continue to hold a &#x27;golden share&#x27; to protect the UK&#x27;s security and defence interests. On 10 February 2006, QinetiQ was floated on the London Stock Exchange. The valuation of the company, and of how much taxpayers would benefit from QinetiQ&#x27;s privatisation, was a subject of considerable debate and controversy.

The company had been valued at between £1.1bn and £1.3bn, with the MoD holding estimated to be worth £616m – £728m, the Carlyle Group&#x27;s holding £341m – £403m, and staff/management&#x27;s holding worth £143m – £169m. Controversy was generated by the very large returns generated for both the Carlyle Group and senior managers at the company; reportedly Sir John Chisholm is speculated to have benefitted by over £20 million alone. Lord Moonie, who handled the initial sale, stated in 2006 that the government&#x27;s 31 per cent stake should not have been sold when equity markets were languishing in 2002. Moonie said that he had argued for the sale to be delayed, but was over-ruled by the Treasury, which had convinced the Ministry of Defence to go ahead.

Controversy also arose around the fact that retail investors were excluded from the initial public offering (IPO) due to QinetiQ&#x27;s complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the &#x27;Sid&#x27; campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some brokerage firms to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an institutional investor but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. Upon its floating on 10 February 2006, QinetiQ had an IPO of 200p per share, resulting in a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006, shares closed at 219.5p, valuing it at over £1.4bn.

Speculation that a consortium including QinetiQ was about to win a £10bn MoD training contract helped push their share price back above 190p in early November 2006. It was announced on 17 January 2007 that the QinetiQ-led Metrix consortium was the preferred bidder for package one of the MoD&#x27;s Defence Training Rationalisation programme, worth approx £16bn.
===NAO inquiry===
In 2007, the National Audit Office conducted an inquiry into the privatisation to determine whether UK taxpayers received good value for money. The inquiry looked at the following issues:
* the choice of privatisation strategy;
* management of the process (the split of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency into two, the sale to Carlyle and the flotation);
* costs incurred and the proceeds achieved; and
* whether the deal met its objectives.
In November 2007, the NAO reported that taxpayers could have gained &quot;tens of millions&quot; more and was critical of the incentive scheme given to QinetiQ managers, the 10 most senior of whom gained £107.5m on an investment of £540,000 in the company&#x27;s shares. The return of 19,990% was described as &quot;excessive&quot; by the NAO. The role of QinetiQ&#x27;s management in negotiating terms with the Carlyle Group while the private equity company was bidding for the business was also criticised by the NAO. Carlyle bought a third of the business for £42m, which grew in value to £372m in less than four years. However, the Ministry of Defence defended the sale:
:&quot;It has delivered excellent value for money, generating more than £800m for the taxpayer, while protecting UK defence and security interests,&quot; said Baroness Taylor, Minister for Defence Equipment and Support.

=== Expansion ===

In January 2007, the company bought &quot;Analex&quot;, a US corporation that provides high technology professional services, principally to the US government and its agencies. It was originally incorporated in 1964 under the name &quot;Biorad&quot; and evolved into &quot;Hadron&quot;, a US government systems consulting firm.

In February 2007, the acquisition of ITS Corporation, a provider of IT services to the US government and its agencies, was announced. The disposal of Aerospace Filtration Systems (formerly part of Westar) was announced at the same time. In June of that year, QinetiQ announced that Apogen Technologies Inc., its US subsidiary, had completed the acquisition of 3H Technology LLC, a specialist IT company with US government and commercial clients. In October, the company completed the acquisition of Boldon James Holdings Limited, a UK-based provider of software for high end secure messaging, primarily for military, government and security customers worldwide.
In March 2007, QinetiQ spun off a new company, Omni-ID Ltd; this entity specialises in the commercial opportunities for passive UHF radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. Prior to the spin off, a research team at QinetiQ had been active since the 1990s to develop new and more effective RFID technologies.

On 9 February 2007, the Carlyle Group sold its remaining 10.3% stake in the group at 205p per share, resulting in a £290 million return on its original investment. During September 2008, the MoD sold its remaining 18.9% holding in QinetiQ at 206p per share, raising £254 million. The British government retained its &#x27;special share&#x27;, giving it control over any potential takeover. In February 2020, QinetiQ acquired military training specialist Newman &amp; Spurr Consultancy Ltd for £14 million.

In November 2022, it was announced QinetiQ had completed the acquisition of the McLean-headquartered provider of cybersecurity and data analytics software to US government agencies, Avantus Federal for $590 million USD.

=== Cyber security ===
During mid-2013, reports emerged that Chinese hackers had allegedly compromised sensitive military research being performed by QinetiQ. It was claimed that, between 2007 and 2010, QinetiQ&#x27;s North American business was the subject of a cyber-attack. At the time of the incidents, the company said it disclosed all of its breaches to the responsible government agencies and these were resolved to their satisfaction. The Pentagon has stated that it still entrusts QinetiQ with sensitive defence technology. The issue of cyber security affected other organisations; a Pentagon report stated that various US government agencies had been victims of cyberattacks.

QinetiQ provides auditing and consultancy services on cyber security to third party businesses. In 2011, the company announced the launch of a strategic collaboration with information security firm Nexor to pool their cyber security portfolios. During 2016, QinetiQ released a whitepaper on the topic, which identified employee behaviour as a major contributing factor in the majority of security breaches. QinetiQ has partnered with mobile phone network provider Vodafone to support end-to-end internet security services.

==Operations==
QinetiQ provides technology-based products and services to numerous government and commercial customers. More than 2,000 of QinetiQ subsidiary Foster-Miller&#x27;s Talon robots have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, most used to remotely locate and disable roadside bombs. QinetiQ&#x27;s SPO stand-off threat detection system has been sold to the US Transportation Security Administration for railway stations and airports.

During August 2008, QinetiQ&#x27;s Zephyr, a solar powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), performed a non-stop flight spanning 14 days; this was a world record for the longest duration unmanned flight. Over the following years, Qinetic performed further record-breaking flights of the UAV. During summer 2018, an improved model of the Zephyr conducted an even-longer flight, lasting nearly 26 days. The Zephyr UAV has been offered as a commercial product, the programme having been acquired by multinational aerospace company Airbus Group. QinetiQ have been involved in the further development of the Zephyr, such as the provision of LIDAR payload for the type.

QinetiQ has a 25-year T3E (Test, Trials, Training and Evaluation) agreement formerly called the Long Term partnering Agreement (LTPA) with the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) to provide test and evaluation services and manage military ranges. It is a major stakeholder in the UK Defence Technology Centre, which places military research contracts on behalf of the MoD.

QinetiQ has a 25-year Maritime Strategic Facilities Agreement (MSCA) with the MoD to provide strategic maritime facilities and capabilities, including hydromechanic facilities at Haslar, biomedical facilities on the UK&#x27;s South Coast, and submarine structures, survivability and shock testing facilities at Rosyth.

===Organisation===
The QinetiQ Group comprises QinetiQ EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Australasia) and QinetiQ North America. QinetiQ North America, which was set up after the takeover of Foster-Miller, is a wholly owned subsidiary of QinetiQ, but remains independent and separated from the QinetiQ group by a proxy agreement with the US to comply with US laws that prevent sensitive technology coming under the control of a foreign venture that takes over a US company. The major UK sites are at Farnborough, Hampshire (the historical Royal Aircraft Establishment) and Malvern, Worcestershire (the historical RSRE/RRE/TRE).

===Workforce===
QinetiQ is one of the ten largest UK employers of science and engineering graduates, recruiting around 150 per year. Between 2002 and 2006, it has appeared in the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers list. During 2005, QinetiQ was accused by union officials of its employees exhibiting higher than average levels of stress-related depression, a finding that was strongly denied by the company. On March 25, 2021, a worker was seriously injured at a QinetiQ-run Ministry of Defence facility in Pendine, Carmarthen.

<doc id="663910" wikidata="Q248876" url="?curid=663910" title="Elmer Layden">
<text>Elmer Francis Layden (May 4, 1903 – June 30, 1973) was an American football player, coach, college athletics administrator, and professional sports executive. He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish where he starred at fullback as a member of the legendary &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; backfield. 

Layden played professionally in the original AFL in 1925 and 1926 with three clubs, the Hartford Blues, the Brooklyn Horsemen, and the Rock Island Independents. 

He began his coaching career during the same two seasons at Columbia College in Dubuque, Iowa, now known as Loras College. Layden then served as the head coach at Duquesne University from 1927 to 1933 and at his alma mater, Notre Dame, from 1934 to 1940, where he also held the position of athletic director. 

From 1941 to 1946, Layden was the commissioner of the National Football League (NFL). He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1951.

==Playing career==

Elmer Layden was born in Davenport, Iowa, where he attended Davenport High School. At Notre Dame, he played fullback alongside quarterback Harry Stuhldreher, left halfback Jim Crowley, and right halfback Don Miller; the four collectively earned the nickname of &quot;The Four Horsemen of Notre Dame&quot; from legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice, and are still considered one of the best backfields in college football history. 

Named an All-American during his senior year, Layden culminated his collegiate career in the 1925 Rose Bowl against Stanford, returning two interceptions for touchdowns in Notre Dame&#x27;s 27–10 victory. 

The Four Horsemen were reunited for a professional football game in 1925 by the Hartford Blues as they played the Cleveland Bulldogs. The game though resulted in a 13–6 Hartford loss, with the Blues reportedly spending $5,000 on the Horsemen for just one game.

==Coaching career==
After his playing days, Layden was head football coach at Columbia College (Dubuque, Iowa) in 1925–26, where he compiled an 8–5–2 record. From 1927 to 1933 he was head coach at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, going 48–16–6 and winning the 1933 season&#x27;s Festival of Palms Bowl (a precursor to the Orange Bowl) on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1934.

Also in 1934, he became head coach and athletic director at Notre Dame, three years after his legendary mentor Knute Rockne was killed in an airplane crash on March 31, 1931.

Layden led the Irish for seven years and posted an overall 47–13–3 docket. His 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State 18–13. His 1938 team finished 8–1, losing only to USC in the season finale. This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System.

Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame. He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools. The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win. They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again. By the time they met again in 1942–43, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place. Unlike the easygoing Layden, Leahy was intense, and after the Irish had thrashed Michigan by a score of 35–12 in 1943, Wolverine coach and athletic director Fritz Crisler never scheduled the Irish again.

While Layden was a solid, competent coach, he was subjected to criticism during his later years at Notre Dame. Critics felt that his teams played too conservatively and lacked scoring punch. Consequently, it was felt that they lost games they should have won.

==Commissioner==

In 1941, the National Football League franchise owners voted to change the league&#x27;s constitution in an attempt to bring all professional football leagues under the authority of one commissioner, who would have similar powers to that of Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; journalist Arch Ward was offered the position of commissioner, but he turned it down and suggested Elmer Layden for the position.

Layden was appointed commissioner in February 1941. His appointment was not voted on by the entire league, which upset owners Alexis Thompson, Bert Bell, and Dan Topping. Chicago Bears owner George Halas contended that Layden&#x27;s hiring was legal because it had been agreed upon by a majority of owners. Layden was signed to a five-year contract with an annual salary of $20,000.

In five years as Commissioner, Layden saw the NFL through the World War II years, in which teams had to use many men of inferior abilities as replacements while most of the regulars were fighting in the war (as did Major League Baseball). During this period a few teams temporarily merged due to lack of manpower, most notably the Pittsburgh Steelers with the Philadelphia Eagles (who were nicknamed the Steagles). The Cleveland Rams ceased operations for the 1943 season.

As NFL commissioner, Layden had once conducted an investigation into a betting scam, without advising the owners, which did not reveal any conspiracy.

At the end of the war, after Japan announced it would surrender, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden called for all of the league&#x27;s teams to play &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at their games, arguing, &quot;The National Anthem should be as much a part of every game as the kick-off. We must not drop it simply because the war is over. We should never forget what it stands for.&quot; Prior to this proclamation &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; had not been officially required to be sung before the start of any NFL games.

Layden&#x27;s tenure as NFL commissioner came to an end in January 1946. After Brooklyn owner Dan Topping withdrew his team from the league to join the new All-America Football Conference, the remaining owners agreed not to renew Layden&#x27;s contract, feeling that he was too much of a gentleman and not forceful enough. Layden was succeeded by Bert Bell.

==Later years==
After leaving the NFL, Layden embarked on a successful business career in Chicago, where he died at the age of 70. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston.

He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951 as a charter member.

==Personal life==
Layden married Edythe Davis on October 25, 1926, who preceded him in death.

<text>Carmine Dominick Giovinazzo ( , born August 24, 1973), is an American actor, writer, painter and musician, known for his role as Detective Danny Messer in &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Giovinazzo was born and raised in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Staten Island, New York, the son of Nancy and Dominick Giovinazzo, a retired NYPD police officer. Growing up, Giovinazzo was an avid athlete. He played baseball for 4 years at Port Richmond High School where he was an Advance all-star as a senior, eventually graduating in 1991, and went on to attend Wagner College on a baseball scholarship. He had hoped to become a professional baseball player, but a serious back injury dashed his career plans; with the support of his family, he turned to acting. He studied acting at Wagner College and HB Studios, and spent four years working mostly non-paying roles in the New York area.

==Career==
In 1997, Giovinazzo moved to Los Angeles. Not long afterward, he successfully landed his first Hollywood role in the pilot of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, in which his character was the show&#x27;s first on-screen victim. Afterwards, he appeared in numerous guest-starring roles on television and in film, including the Learning Curve, &quot;Billy&#x27;s Hollywood Screen Kiss&quot;, &quot;For Love of the Game&quot;, &quot;The Big Brass Ring&quot;, and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. He was also cast as one of the stars of the short-lived UPN sitcom &quot;Shasta McNasty&quot;, which was nominated for a People&#x27;s Choice Award. Other films in which he had starring roles include &quot;In Enemy Hands&quot; with William H. Macy, and &quot;Players&quot; with Freddy Rodriguez and Peter Dobson. He played Tony Galper, the victim in the final episode of the TV series &quot;Columbo&quot;.

Giovinazzo was cast as forensic scientist Danny Messer on the hit TV series &quot;&quot; and is the first actor to appear in all three &quot;CSI&quot; series; his character was introduced in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;MIA/NYC NonStop&quot; (along with the other &quot;CSI: NY&quot; cast members), and he guest-starred in season three of the Las Vegas-based as street racer Thumpy G in the episode &quot;Revenge is Best Served Cold&quot; (though it is never specified that this guest spot was in any way related to his character on &quot;CSI: NY&quot;). Giovinazzo penned season six&#x27;s vampire-themed episode &quot;&quot;, joining series leads Melina Kanakaredes and Gary Sinise who have also written episodes for the series.

In 2014, Giovinazzo portrayed the recurring role of Sid Markham in season two of the USA television series &quot;Graceland&quot;. In this series, he reunited with his former &quot;CSI: NY&quot; co-star Vanessa Ferlito.

==Personal life==
Giovinazzo plays the guitar, and writes songs and poetry. He is also a painter, mostly in oils, and one of his paintings appeared in the &quot;&quot; episode of &quot;CSI: NY&quot;. He is currently a lead vocalist in the band Ceesau, which released one album, &quot;Era of the Exposed&quot; (2008). The song &quot;Tear To Spare&quot;, from this album, was played in the &quot;CSI: NY&quot; sixth-season episode &quot;Sanguine Love&quot;, which Giovinazzo wrote.

Giovinazzo is a cousin of Buddy Giovinazzo and Larry Romano.

Giovinazzo married actress Vanessa Marcil on July 11, 2010, in a private ceremony in New York City. Marcil filed for divorce in August 2012 on the basis of irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized in March 2013.

<doc id="663918" wikidata="Q6721658" url="?curid=663918" title="Mabuiag">
<text>The Mabuyag (plural Mabuygilgal) are an Indigenous Australian group of Torres Strait Islander people united by a common language, strong ties of kinship and survived as skilled hunter–fisher–gatherers and horticulturalists in family groups or clans living on and around Mabuiag Island, in Torres Strait in Queensland, Australia. They are ethnically Melanesian.

They in common with all Torres Strait Islanders had a mixed reputation for hostility as well as eagerness to develop trading links with outsiders before they became Christian over the 1870s. The language of the island is Gœmulgaw Ya, alt. Mabuygilgaw Ya, a dialect of Kala Lagaw Ya.

The society consists of two moieties, the &quot;Koey Buway&quot; &quot;Senior Buway&quot; and &quot;Moegi Buway&quot;, &quot;Junior Buway&quot;; the terms relate to the senior (older brother) and junior (younger brother) leaders of the &quot;Zugubal&quot; &quot;Sky Gods&quot;. The &quot;Moegi Buway&quot; include The Mabuygilgal of Wagedagam (&quot;Rear-Side&quot;) on the northwest (&quot;kukidagam&quot;) side of Mabuyaagi (their totem wind and direction) and the Goemulgal of the mid-South-East side, while the &quot;Koey Buway&quot; include the Mabuygilgal of Panay-Dabangay (&quot;Near-Side&quot;) on the north-east side (&quot;naygayidagam&quot;) and the &quot;Kaygas&quot; (shovel-nose &quot;shark&quot;) people of the south-west (&quot;zeydoegam&quot;).

==Mythology==
One of the great culture heros of the Mabuyaagi people was Kuyam (alt. Kuiam, Kwoiam). He was described as having a long, narrow head with both a bulging brow and a protuberant occipital lobe, capped by a high crown. Paradoxically, these are the features the Mabuiag associated with the mainland Australian Aborigines they occasionally encountered, a people they otherwise despised. Further, the Mabuiag identify the origins of Kuyam with Cape York: Kuyama, Kuyam&#x27;s father, armed only with a spear and woomera, followed a downdrift of blades of grass northwards from Kuuku Ya&#x27;u territory on north-east Cape York, walked across the sea and set foot on Mabuyaagi in Dugong buway territory (north-east Mabuyaagi), where he married Kuinama, of the South-West Goemu people, though she was originally from Muri. Unable to accept their ways, Kuyamu then returned to Australia. His abandoned wife gives birth to a son who she called Kyuam (Kuyama), who taught himself how to use his father&#x27;s woomera and spear. When one day his aged, half-blind mother, failing to recognise him, cursed him for stepping on the strands she was using to weave a mat, he stabbed her eyes and mouth with a three-pronged spear, and runs amok on head-hunting raids on Boigu, mainland Papua, and back, until he was finally on Mabuyaagi killed by warriors from Moa. He was not beheaded, a typical part of Torres Strait headhunting culture; famous warriors were not beheaded. However, Kuyam was one of a few Culture Heros, others including Wayath and Amipuru.

==History==
Mabuaig Island, along with many other islands of Torres Strait, was annexed by the State of Queensland in 1879, giving the Queensland Government control over the east-west shipping passage through the Torres Strait, plus some control over movements between Papua and Australia. Before the legal recognition of native title indigenous land ownership was assumed to be non-existent, and therefore the Mabuiag people, who maintained continual buwai-based land holding ownership patterns, were in legal limbo, with no traditional rights recognised, but also no citizenship rights either.

However, the traditional ownership patterns were unofficially recognised by various European officials. For example, when the Acting Government Resident, Hugh Milman, who was based at Thursday Island), visited Mabuiag Island in 1886 he reported that: &quot;there is no doubt that every acre has a reputed owner, that every grove or single tree of any value has its proper and legitimate hereditary owner.

After the federation of Australia in 1901, Torres Strait Islanders including the people of Mabuaig island became subject to &quot;protection&quot;, and it was not until well after World War Two, in the 1960s, that they could get married or travel to mainland Australia or other islands without Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs (DAIA) approval.

Since that time, while many are often absent working in industries such as Torres Strait Islander fisheries (pearling industry, crayfishing, etc.) or have moved to Badu Island, Thursday Island, or mainland Australia, some (now estimated at approximately 250) have continued and continuously held on to their traditional tenure (&quot;native title&quot;) occupying, using, and enjoying the island and its surrounds in a manner prescribed by traditional law and custom.
People gathered... on this island, like their ancestors before them, have occupied it and maintained the connection with it for hundreds of years. Today they continue to speak their traditional language, they practise fishing, hunting and collecting and in doing that, they make use of the specialised historical knowledge accumulated over centuries. They perform customary dances and songs, they manage sacred sites. They utilise their traditional kinship system to organise social and economic life. They are in all respects the owners of this land. )
==Local lore==
The home seas, islands, and reefs occupied, used, and criss-crossed by the people of Mabuiag Island for many generations, have been described as follows:
What first appear to be undifferentiated patches of coral and salt water are Islanders&#x27; exclusive marine domains - a vast, intricate water library where history dwells in places, not in time, and all the sea is named. Islands, reefs, channels and the resources they contain belong to.. Mabuiag people because mythical ancestors like Sesere, Zigin, and Wad caught turtles, dugong, or fish there
The people of Mabuiag Island, for instance, believe their afterworld lies in Kibu to their northwest. It is believed that when an Islander dies, their &quot;mari&quot; (life spirit) first goes to Boigu, leaves word for the Boigu &quot;marimulaimabaigal&quot; spirit talkers to report how they died, and then becomes a &quot;markai&quot; (heavenly spirit) and sails to Kibu at sundown with the prevailing winds

If the spirit of the deceased cannot join other ancestors at Kibu, they may stay and cause problems among the living. Before the arrival of missionaries, when someone died, the people of Mabuiag, as was the case for all other Islanders and neighbouring Papuans, would assist the deceased into Kibu by performing a mortuary ritual consisting of sacred dances and feasting at a particular point a few weeks after the death of the person. The arrangements for the rituals and feast were always carried out by the &quot;marigeth&quot; spirit-hand, the special term used for the in-laws, whose responsibility this was.

Subsequent to the arrival of missionaries, this original commemoration has been Christianised as the &quot;Kulaw Gudpudai&quot; tombstone opening. The important pre-Christian tradition still exist, only those with clearly pagan meaning being disused or disguised in various ways. The role of the &quot;marigeth&quot; is still very important: &#x27;in-laws dig deep into their pockets to present the deceased&#x27;s family with an engraved headstone, brought all the way from Cairns, Townsville or even Brisbane, shrouded in hundreds of yards of colorful cloth and money envelopes&#x27;.

Within Mabuaig Island local lore, families may only exercise control over land and sea rights around Mabuaig Island if children have island residences and if relatives can be guaranteed a proper tombstone opening. Migration away from the island complicates people&#x27;s ability to carry out these burial practices (above), and makes it difficult for the descendants of people living away from Mabuaig Island to establish legal title to family estates.

The Torres Strait Island Regional Council operate the Ngalpun Ngulaygaw Lag Resource Centre in Main Street.

The Mabuiag Indigenous Knowledge Centre (IKC), named Ngalpun Ngulaygaw Lag Resource Centre, is the oldest IKC operated by Torres Strait Island Regional Council. Opened 9 August 2002 to provide library services to the island community, the IKC has partnered with State Library of Queensland to deliver many programs and projects over the years. Two of these projects include &quot;Away with Words&quot; (2008) and &quot;Culture Love&quot; (2010). &quot;Culture Love&quot; was a continuation of A&quot;way with Words&quot; and led to the creation of a digital story, retelling &quot;Amipuru&quot;, one of the myths recorded in Margaret Lawrie&#x27;s book, &quot;Myths and Legends of Torres Strait&quot;. In the &quot;Away with Words&quot; workshop, local children created artwork based on the &quot;Amipuru&quot;. In the &quot;Culture Love&quot; workshop, the children created clay sculptures, images, and recorded animated story in the local &quot;Kalaw Lagaw Ya&quot; language.

<doc id="663922" wikidata="Q963898" url="?curid=663922" title="Dan Rostenkowski">
<text>Daniel David Rostenkowski (January 2, 1928 – August 11, 2010) was a United States Representative from Chicago, serving for 36 years, from 1959 to 1995. He became one of the most powerful legislators in Congress, especially in matters of taxation. He was imprisoned in 1996. A Democrat and son of a Chicago alderman, Rostenkowski was for many years Democratic Committeeman of Chicago&#x27;s 32nd Ward, retaining this position while also serving in Congress.

In national politics, he rose by virtue of seniority to the rank of Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in 1981. As Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he played a critical role in formulating tax policy during the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan, including the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which cut the top federal bracket to 50%, and the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which further lowered it to 28% and reduced the number of brackets to only two. He was also involved in trade policy, as well as reforms of the welfare system, health care, and Social Security programs.

Rostenkowski closed legislative deals between the toughest power brokers in the U.S., from union chiefs to corporate titans to president Reagan and to everyone in between. The book &quot;Chicago and the American Century&quot; credits Rostenkowski with securing billions of dollars in federal money for projects in Chicago and Illinois. The book named him the sixth most significant politician to come from Chicago in the entire twentieth century.

Rostenkowski&#x27;s political career, however, ended abruptly in 1994 when he was indicted on corruption charges relating to his role in the Congressional Post Office Scandal, and then narrowly defeated for reelection by Republican Michael Patrick Flanagan. He subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud in 1996 and was fined and sentenced to 17 months in prison. In December 2000, President Bill Clinton pardoned Rostenkowski, who had already served-out his sentence.

==Early life and political beginnings==
Rostenkowski was born on January 2, 1928, into a political family in Chicago to Joseph P. and Priscilla (Dombrowski) Rostenkowski. His grandfather Piotr had immigrated from the region of Tuchola, Poland. His father, Joe, locally known as &quot;Big Joe Rusty&quot;, served as alderman and committeeman of the predominantly Polish 32nd Ward in what was then known as &quot;Polish Downtown&quot; for 24 years. As a child, Dan and his two sisters, Marcie and Gladys, often saw their family home double as a meeting place for precinct captains who, like Walter Kmiec from his father&#x27;s ward organization, would later assist him in bringing in the vote in 1960 for John Kennedy.

The Rostenkowski home was on the second floor of 1349 Noble Street in Chicago, above the tavern owned by Priscilla and adjacent to the alderman&#x27;s insurance agency and the headquarters of the regular Democratic 32nd ward organization. Near dawn on August 6, 1938, Joe heard shots. Two top precinct captains for the alderman were shot multiple times as they slept in a car parked in front of the Rostenkowski home. Joe took his family to the Rostenkowski summer home in Genoa City, Wisconsin. The killers were never caught.

In 1941, at the age of 13, Rostenkowski accompanied his father to Washington to witness the inauguration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt for his third term. In 1955 his father lost his aldermanic seat after supporting then-County Clerk Richard J. Daley for Mayor over a fellow Polish leader named Ben Adamowski.

Following his graduation from St. Stanislaus Kostka grammar school, Rostenkowski attended St. John&#x27;s Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin, where he earned letters in baseball, football, basketball and track. After graduating from St. John&#x27;s in 1946, he enlisted in the United States Army and served for two years as a private with the Seventh Infantry Division in Korea. In 1949 he tried out for the Philadelphia Athletics, but his father convinced him to give up his dream and come home, as his mother was losing a battle with cancer. After her death, he enrolled at Loyola University in Chicago.

==Illinois General Assembly==
In 1952, while still a student at Loyola, the twenty-four-year-old Rostenkowski was elected as one of three legislators from the 27th district to the Illinois House of Representatives. He was its youngest member. As a state lawmaker, Rostenkowski worked on the planning and financing of a major federal highway from downtown Chicago to the new O&#x27;Hare International Airport. Like Daley and many other Chicago politicians before him, serving in Springfield was often viewed as a first step to a higher office in Chicago. The perception of the state legislature as training ground went hand in hand with another idea, that Chicago, not Springfield or Washington constituted the most desirable locus of political life. After two years in the House, he was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1954. In 1957 he pushed a bill to extend state funded free polio vaccines to children as well as a bill that would have provided bonuses of up to $555 for Korean War veterans – financed by a one-cent cigarette tax. It passed, but was later rejected by Illinois voters in a 1958 referendum. While serving his second term in the senate, Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley suggested that he run for Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, instead, Rostenkowski pushed for and received Daley&#x27;s support to run for the United States Congress.

==Connecting with the Kennedys==
As a young and outgoing urban Democrat, new to Washington, Rostenkowski quickly found mentors and made friends with other Democrats. His relationship with Massachusetts Reps. Edward Boland and Torbert Macdonald as well as John F. Kennedy aides Larry O&#x27;Brien and Kenny O&#x27;Donnell led to his involvement in JFK&#x27;s run for the White House. In 1960 at the request of the Kennedy campaign he gave speeches in southern states for Kennedy. Chicago voters turned out in large majority for Kennedy.

On September 26, 1960, Rostenkowski witnessed what many consider the turning point in Kennedy&#x27;s battle with Richard Nixon. Kennedy invited Rostenkowski to the CBS studios in downtown Chicago to view in person, the first ever televised Presidential debate. Unaware of the two candidates&#x27; stark differences on camera, Rostenkowski later said &quot;I was under the impression that Kennedy lost the debate.&quot;

In the aftermath of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination Rostenkowski was one of a small group who made regular visits to Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s home in Georgetown. &quot;On a regular basis Kenny O&#x27;Donnell would get three or four of us from Capitol Hill, who worked with Jack Kennedy, together at Jackie&#x27;s house. We would sit around Jackie&#x27;s living room with Bobby Kennedy, eat sandwiches, have some drinks and tell war stories. Jackie would laugh so hard her side would hurt sometimes.

==Early years, U.S. Congress==
In his first decade in Congress, Rostenkowski gradually attained a position of influence in the House. In his freshman term he secured a position on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. After the death of Illinois congressional delegation leader Thomas J. O&#x27;Brien in 1964, Rostenkowski inherited O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s seat on the Ways and Means Committee. In 1966 and again in 1968, he was elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. &quot;His rough edges, Chicago syntax, and intimidating bulk made him a stereotype of Chicago machine Democrats who the Washington media enjoyed portraying as mere stooges of mayor Richard J. Daley&quot;.

During his early years in congress, Rostenkowski&#x27;s record was typical of a northern Democrat with close ties to a powerful big city political organization. He made sure that Chicago received its full share of funds under programs like the Law Enforcement Assistance Act. And in the face of white backlash from his district, he supported civil rights legislation and the various social welfare programs that made up President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty. He also argued in favor of federal funding of inner-city renewal projects and urban mass transit networks. By 1967, Daley often looked to Rostenkowski as Chicago&#x27;s chief liaison in Washington, and counted on him to deliver federal funds.

Rostenkowski supported the American effort in Vietnam until 1971, when he joined anti-war Congressmen in an attempt to force a quick withdrawal of American troops by voting against certain military appropriation bills.

A great admirer of Lyndon Johnson, he was tapped by the President to second the nomination of Hubert Humphrey as his vice president at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. Four years later, at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Johnson would again ask Rostenkowski to take the podium, but this time the results proved costly to the young congressman&#x27;s future in Washington.

==1968 Democratic National Convention==
Met by anti-war protesters, racial unrest, and rioting on the streets, the 1968 Democratic National Convention, held at the International Amphitheatre proved an international embarrassment for the city. House Majority Leader Carl Albert, the convention chairman, and Rostenkowski&#x27;s boss, was unable to control the rowdy behavior of the delegates inside the hall. Rostenkowski happened to be manning the phones on the podium when a furious Lyndon Johnson called from his Texas ranch and ordered him to take over the gavel to quiet the proceedings on the convention floor. Rostenkowski did, and an embarrassed Albert never forgave him.

Two years later, Rostenkowski was running for a third term as chairman of the Democratic Caucus and did not expect any opposition. But to his surprise, the Texas delegation nominated their colleague, Olin Teague, a popular war hero and Chairman of the Veteran&#x27;s Affairs Committee. Even though Teague announced that he was not a candidate, they elected him anyway, 155 to 91. &quot;I got defeated by Tiger Teague, who voted for me&quot;, exclaimed Rostenkowski. &quot;I saw him vote for me.&quot; The liberal Democrats voted against Rostenkowski because of his ties to Mayor Daley, who was a pariah because of the 1968 convention and many of Albert&#x27;s friends voted against him because of the feud.

==Political payback==
A few weeks later, Albert was elected Speaker of the House, while Hale Boggs replaced him as majority leader. Boggs asked the new speaker three times to name Rostenkowski assistant majority leader and three times Albert refused.

Albert instead picked Rostenkowski&#x27;s close friend, Tip O&#x27;Neill, to become whip. This allowed O&#x27;Neill to leap over Rostenkowski on the leadership ladder, a ladder that led to O&#x27;Neill becoming speaker just six years later. &quot;The events of that January shadowed the relationship between O&#x27;Neill and Rostenkowski from that point on&quot; said former Representative James Shannon, &quot;Every step of the way, Danny Rostenkowski looked at Tip O&#x27;Neill and, while he loved the guy felt, &#x27;Man, that is where I should be&#x27;.&quot;

==Political comeback==
In the early 1970s with his hopes of a leadership position lost, President Johnson out of office and Daley out of favor with the Republican administration, Rostenkowski began to rebuild his career.
Though he rarely spoke on the floor, he was offering legislation on his own, such as anti-pollution bills, subsidies to local museums, and a proposal to grant renters the same tax breaks as homeowners.

In 1974, Ways and Means chairman Al Ullman named Rostenkowski chairman of the committee&#x27;s newly created subcommittee on health. In this role Rostenkowski obtained expertise in two critical areas of policy that would serve him well in his future: health care and taxes.

Late in 1976, Richard Daley died, leading to speculation that Rostenkowski would return home to Chicago and run for mayor. That same year, speaker Carl Albert announced he would not seek another term in Congress. Meaning Tip O&#x27;Neill would become speaker, this paved the way for Rostenkowski to begin the climb back up the leadership ladder.

He played a key role in the election of Jim Wright as the House Majority Leader. In return, O&#x27;Neill and Wright appointed Rostenkowski chief deputy to the new Democratic whip, John Brademas. The 1980 election was a disaster for the Democratic Party, but it opened up new opportunities for advancement to Rostenkowski.

Rostenkowski easily defeated future Congressman Luis Gutiérrez&#x27;s bid to replace him as 32nd Ward Democratic Committeeman in the 1984 Chicago Democratic primary.

In 1986, Rostenkowski was charged with drunk driving in Wisconsin and was charged $555.00 and had his license suspended in Illinois for one year.

===Chairman Rostenkowski===
In 1980 the defeats of Chairman Al Ullman and Majority Whip John Brademas presented Rostenkowski, the highest-ranking member of Ways and Means, with a choice: he could chair that committee or succeed Brademas as Majority Whip. Since the position of Majority Whip is usually a stepping-stone to the majority leadership and, ultimately, to the House speakership, Rostenkowski was tempted to take it. However, his skill and vast experience on the tax writing Ways and Means Committee won out. In January 1981, Rostenkowski was elected committee chairman. As chairman, his job was to satisfy the demands within the House and with the President, so that he could enact legislation. Rostenkowski received criticism during his early years as chairman, with the media speculating that he was, &quot;in over his head&quot; leading the complex tax writing committee. He lost his first few legislative battles with new President Ronald Reagan in 1981, but, in 1983, he successfully piloted a complex overhaul of the Social Security System.

By 1984, Chairman Rostenkowski began to hit his stride. He was praised for his role in drafting the 1984 Deficit Reduction Act, a three-year, $50 billion tax hike. During his 13 years as chairman, Rostenkowski grew to become larger than life, especially to Ways and Means colleagues. &quot;He ran the committee the old-fashioned way, with loyalty, trust, and his word&quot; said former congressman Mike Andrews of Texas. He was a consensus builder who commanded through his political judgment and his ability to make a deal. Not as much of an expert on the tax code as was a previous chairman Wilbur Mills, or one to lead with a light hand, such as Ullman, Rostenkowski built a staff of dedicated experts who were given broad leeway to shape legislation, leaving for himself the political judgments, and actions that were required to pass the proposals. &quot;Is it good law&quot;? was his directive to his aides. &quot;I want people to be able to say, that son of a gun, he had some guts, he had some fortitude, he realized what you had to be in order to be a national legislator.&quot;

A profile of Rostenkowski in the July 1989 issue of &quot;National Journal&quot; said &quot;The chairman is a man of action, not words; a doer, not a rhetorician; one who thrives at the negotiating table, not the speaker&#x27;s lectern...he has nourished an image as a legislative strategist that is perhaps unsurpassed on Capitol Hill. He wants to make laws, and as a lobbyist put it, &#x27;he doesn&#x27;t like people throwing a lot of dust in the gears&#x27;.&quot;

=== &quot;Write Rosty&quot;===
On May 28, 1985, he rose to national prominence when he delivered the televised Democratic response to an Oval Office address by President Reagan calling for tax reform. In his eleven-minute address, Rostenkowski referred to his working class Polish neighborhood saying many neighbors have moved to the suburbs. &quot;They make more money than their parents. In most cases their lives have changed for the better. But the tax system has changed for the worse, and so has their faith in it.&quot; &quot;Why should a bank teller pay a higher tax rate than the bank? Why should a gas station attendant pay a greater share than the oil company he works for? &quot;Trying to tax people and businesses, everyone, fairly&quot;, he told the nation. &quot;That&#x27;s been the historic Democratic commitment.&quot; He called for a tax system that was &quot;simple and fair and also gives real relief for middle income tax payers.&quot; Rostenkowski concluded the speech with an appeal to the &quot;silent majority&quot; He asked viewers fed up with the current tax system to write him a letter to show their support, &quot;Even if you can&#x27;t spell Rostenkowski, put down what they used to call my father and grandfather: Rosty&quot;, he said into the camera. &quot;Just address it to R-O-S-T-Y, Washington, D.C.&quot; Within days his appeal had generated over 75,000 letters making the obscure congressman something of a folk hero. The May 30 issue of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; asked &quot;Has a Star been Born?&quot; &quot;Excellent&quot; said the president&#x27;s political director, Ed Rollins. &quot;He is the only guy who has not paled beside the president in a Democratic response.&quot; Chris Matthews, then press secretary to House Speaker O&#x27;Neill said &quot;He spoke right to the Knights of Columbus guy who voted for Reagan last time and might do it again, and he told him he&#x27;s watching out for his interests.&quot; &quot;He is deeply committed to the proposition that the tax code must be revised to allow working Americans to keep more of their salaries.&quot;

==Major legislation enacted during chairmanship==
Under Rostenkowski&#x27;s leadership, the Ways and Means committee passed several major pieces of legislation, including:

* Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981
* Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982
* Social Security Amendments of 1983 () 
* Interest and Dividends Tax Compliance Act of 1983 ()
* Deficit Reduction Act of 1984
* Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985
* Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 () 
* Tax Reform Act of 1986
* Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987
* Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 ()
* Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 () 
* Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990
* Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993

==Felony conviction==
Rostenkowski&#x27;s political career ended in 1994 after a two-year investigation by the Justice Department. In a case led by future U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Rostenkowski was indicted on corruption charges for his role in the House Post Office scandal. He was forced to step down from all Congressional leadership positions. In elections later that year, after winning the Democratic primary, Rostenkowski lost his seat in a narrow election and retired from political life.

Charges against Rostenkowski included: keeping &quot;ghost&quot; employees on his payroll (paying salaries at taxpayer expense for no-show &quot;jobs&quot;); using Congressional funds to buy gifts such as chairs and ashtrays for friends; diverting taxpayer funds to pay for vehicles used for personal transportation; tampering with a Grand Jury witness; and trading in officially purchased stamps for cash at the House Post Office.

While the stamps-for-cash allegation received the most media coverage, those charges were dismissed on the recommendation of the prosecutor. In 1996, he pleaded guilty to reduced charges of mail fraud. He was fined and sentenced to 17 months in prison, of which he served 15 at the Oxford Federal Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, and the remaining two months at a halfway house in Chicago. Rostenkowski was pardoned in December 2000 by President Bill Clinton, who said, &quot;Rostenkowski had done a lot for his country and had more than paid for his mistakes.&quot;

==Changing times==
Rostenkowski acknowledged breaking House rules regarding stationery-store purchases and employing individuals who did little or no work – practices that his supporters argued were common on the Hill. &quot;He took the hit for the whole House for practices that were there since time immemorial&quot;, said Republican Congressman Bill Frenzel of Minnesota. Democratic Congressman Anthony Beilenson of California said &quot;I can&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s venal or corrupt. He was inattentive and continued the old ways.&quot;

Former President Gerald Ford, whose lone pardon letter in all his post-White House years was on behalf of Rostenkowski, told a biographer, &quot;Danny&#x27;s problem was he played precisely under the rules of the city of Chicago. Now, those aren&#x27;t the same rules that any other place in the country lives by, but in Chicago they were totally legal, and Danny got a screwing&quot;.

In his commentary titled: &quot;The Rules Kept Changing; Dan Rostenkowski Didn&#x27;t&quot;, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko, a frequent Rostenkowski critic, wrote &quot;Nobody should be taking pleasure from Rostenkowski&#x27;s misfortune. Not unless you have never, ever, broken even a minor law and gotten away with it, fudged a bit on your taxes or violated any of the Ten Commandments.&#x27; &quot;Only a few decades ago, none of this would have been happening. That&#x27;s because the rules changed. Most of the things he was nailed for would have been legal and common or, at worst, nickel-dime offenses when he began his career in Congress.&quot; Royko also questioned the motives of federal prosecutors, &quot;Rostenkowski was a big political fish-the kind of trophy that an ambitious federal prosecutor loves to stuff and hang on his wall…That&#x27;s what did Rostenkowski in – a federal prosecutor&#x27;s personal ambitions.&quot;

In a 1998 interview with John F. Kennedy, Jr. for &quot;George Magazine&quot;, Rostenkowski estimated the government spent over $20 million on his case. &quot;Not many people in this country can counter resources like that, and I&#x27;m not one of them... I couldn&#x27;t finance the fight any longer.&quot;

In the end, Rostenkowski once lamented to a friend, &quot;I&#x27;m going to jail for sending a guy a rocking chair.&quot;

Rostenkowski&#x27;s downfall in 1994 was portrayed by Republicans as emblematic of Democratic corruption. The scandal helped fuel the Republican victory in the House, led by Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America. &quot;The rise and fall of Dan Rostenkowski tracks the rise and fall of Democrats in the House&quot;, concludes Richard E. Cohen in his book on Rostenkowski. &quot;It is a story of power, accomplishments, and, ultimately, failure and humiliation.&quot; Rostenkowski was defeated by Republican attorney Michael Patrick Flanagan by a margin of eight points. Flanagan would be defeated two years later by Democrat Rod Blagojevich. Similar to Rostenkowski, Blagojevich was sentenced to 14-years in prison following 2012 federal convictions for corruption.

==In Chicago==
Throughout his career in Washington, Rostenkowski returned to Chicago almost every weekend. In his early days he would drive to and from Washington with two other young Illinois Congressmen, Republicans Harold Collier and future Republican leader Robert Michel. Upon his return every Friday, Rostenkowski met with Mayor Richard J. Daley at his City Hall office to discuss Chicago&#x27;s agenda in Washington. Besides Daley, Rostenkowski worked with five other Chicago Mayors, Michael Bilandic, Jane Byrne, Harold Washington, Eugene Sawyer and Richard M. Daley. During the 1980s &quot;Council Wars&quot; pitted the mostly white City Council against Mayor Washington, Chicago&#x27;s first Black mayor. The city was dubbed &quot;Beirut on the Lake&quot; by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. During this turbulent period Rostenkowski was a tower of stability. &quot;He made sure the city got its fair share, no matter who was mayor&quot;, said Bill Daley &quot;Danny felt he had to help the pathetic armatures in the Mayor&#x27;s office because he had a love for the city. &quot;He did more for the city than anybody else&quot;, said Alderman Edward M. Burke, chairman of the City Council&#x27;s finance committee. &quot;But he never asked for credit. He just went to the mayor. That&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s done in Chicago.&quot; Local political scientist Paul Green said, &quot;During a decade of chaos, he became an insurance policy for the city&quot;.

Rostenkowski gave up his position as Democratic Committeeman of the 32nd Ward in 1984, but retained local influence as he was able to essentially hand the position to his protégé, Alderman Terry Gabinski.

An unabashed supporter of Chicago interests, Rostenkowski paid attention to the needs of Chicago-based institutions –especially when they promised more jobs for Chicago area workers.&quot;I make no apology for my efforts to build a stronger Chicago.&quot; In the early 1980s Rostenkowski successfully fought off repeated attempts to impose a transaction tax on commodity traders at the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. Such a tax would have been fatal to the exchanges, driving business out of Chicago to overseas markets. Rostenkowski helped secure for the city of Chicago the right to tax passengers flying in and out of its airports. The tax, originally intended to raise money for the construction of a third airport, now yields $90 million annually for improvements at O&#x27;Hare and Midway Airport. But its passage was in big trouble before Rostenkowski stepped in to salvage it. According to Ways and Means lore, he threatened to hold up the entire federal budget at one point until he was sure the tax was in place.

Rostenkowski was also considered a longtime leader of Chicago Polonia and was seen to represent its interests in Washington along with fellow Congressman Roman Pucinski.

==For Chicago==
In his book &quot;Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science&quot;, author Charles Wheelan wrote &quot;We Chicagoans can drive around the city and literally point to things that Rosty built.&quot; Although Rostenkowski never &quot;literally&quot; built anything with his own money or labor, he delivered federal funds for Chicago and the State of Illinois. Some of his notable projects include: securing $32 million for the Blue Line of the Chicago Transit Authority which expanded travel from the Chicago Loop to O&#x27;Hare International Airport, $450 million to repave and expand the Kennedy Expressway, $25 million to fix the dangerous S Curve on Lake Shore Drive $4 billion for the Deep Tunnel Project, which was designed to keep raw sewage from entering the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, while also protecting over half a million suburban and city home owners threatened by flooded basements. He followed that with $42.4 million for reservoirs in McCook and Thornton Townships and by O&#x27;Hare airport, $16.8 million for downtown&#x27;s State Street Mall renovation, $3.5 million for the construction of the Cook County Boot Camp, a military-style alternative for first-time youthful offenders. When the Chicago White Sox baseball team was considering moving to Florida, Rostenkowski secured a $150 million bond authority for the construction of US Cellular Field. Once nearly abandoned and left in disrepair, he ensured $75 million in tax-free bonds for the remodeling of Navy Pier, which today has become Chicago&#x27;s preeminent tourist attraction. To ease erosion that threatened Lake Shore Drive and several harbors and museums along the Chicago lake front, Rostenkowski secured $2.2 million for the Chicago Shoreline Protection Project, and laid the foundation for a coordinated partnership among the Army Corps of Engineers, the federal government and the City of Chicago. He also was responsible for securing funding for the upkeep of Chicago area bridges including the Chicago Skyway, the Division, Cermak, and Roosevelt street bridges.

In January 1983 Plitt Theaters filed a lawsuit to obtain a permit to demolish the historic Chicago Theatre. Mayor Jane Byrne and other civic leaders appealed to Rostenkowski to assist them in obtaining a federal Urban Development Action Grant to save the theater. Grants of this kind were being frozen from Chicago by Samuel Pierce, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in reprisal for Rostenkowski&#x27;s opposition to the Reagan administration&#x27;s Urban Enterprise Zone bill. Rostenkowski considered these zones a Republican gimmick that would help businesses escape taxes without addressing chronic inner-city unemployment. Rostenkowski called his friend Vice President George H. W. Bush, &quot;If I don&#x27;t get that grant, you&#x27;re going to have one very pissed off chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for your administration&#x27;s pending tax bill&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Pierce phoned Rostenkowski to ask if he could come up and see him. Sure, the congressman replied, just bring the papers for the theater project.

In a move that was controversial at the time, Rostenkowski won tax breaks for local developers to build Presidential Towers, a large four-tower apartment complex in the middle of what was then a Skid Row neighborhood. The project spurred development of Chicago&#x27;s West Loop and led to thousands of young professionals moving to downtown Chicago. The once blighted area grew to attract restaurants and other industries, including Harpo Studios, where &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; was taped.

==Later life==

===After Congress===
Following his political career, he operated Danross Associates, a Chicago-based legislative and government affairs firm. He also worked as a political commentator, as well as a guest lecturer at Northwestern University and a Senior Fellow
at Loyola University Chicago.
Rostenkowski received a federal pension of between US$97,000 and US$125,000 per year. Congressional pensions are based on years of service and Rostenkowski is one of the few Congressmen to have served 36 years in Congress.

Rostenkowski&#x27;s papers are now held at the Congressional Archives at Loyola University Chicago.

==Death==

On August 11, 2010, Rostenkowski died at the age of 82 from the effects of lung cancer at his summer home in Powers Lake, Wisconsin.

A funeral was held on August 17, 2010, at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church in northwest Chicago, with his body being buried in Saint Adalbert Catholic Cemetery, at Niles, Illinois.

<text>A fleet submarine is a submarine with the speed, range, and endurance to operate as part of a navy&#x27;s battle fleet. Examples of fleet submarines are the British First World War era K class and the American World War II era &quot;Gato&quot; class.

The term has survived in Britain to refer to modern nuclear-powered attack submarines. In the United States Navy, the term came to be used primarily for the long-range submarines that served in World War II.

==Examples==
=== United States ===
The term was used by the United States Navy to distinguish submarines suitable for long range patrols in the Pacific Ocean from earlier classes such as the United States S-class submarines. The initial goal, pursued with frequent interruptions since the &quot;AA-1&quot;-class (aka &quot;T&quot;-class) launched 1918–19, was to produce a submarine with a surfaced speed of 21 knots to operate with the Standard-type battleships of the surface fleet. Most of the nine &quot;V-boats&quot; launched 1924–33 (&quot;V-1&quot; through &quot;V-6&quot;) were either attempts to produce a fleet submarine or were long-range submarine cruisers. Eventually, a long range of was combined with high speed, beginning with the &quot;Salmon&quot;-class launched in 1938, to allow sustained operations in Japanese home waters while based at Pearl Harbor. These qualities also proved important in the Pacific commerce raiding of World War II, but the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty&#x27;s prohibition on unrestricted submarine warfare precluded inter-war planning in this area. Although the &quot;Gato&quot;-class was considered the fully developed archetype, the earlier &quot;Porpoise&quot;, &quot;Salmon&quot;, &quot;Sargo&quot; and &quot;Tambor&quot;-classes were incrementally improved prototypes distinctly different from the two contemporary experimental &quot;Mackerel&quot;-class coastal submarines. The &quot;Tambor&quot;s were fully developed and similar to the &quot;Gato&quot;s except for diving depth and separation of the engines into two compartments.

=== Japanese ===
Japanese I-boats were a conceptually similar long-range differentiation from smaller &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;sea-going&quot; Ro-boats, although some I-boats had features like aircraft hangars and large-caliber deck guns more often associated with submarine cruisers.

=== British ===
In order to get the speeds – over 20 knots while surfaced – required to match their capital ships and to be able to screen ahead of the fleet or flank the enemy, the British initially used steam propulsion. The K-class entering service in 1916 were large for their time. Although able to reach 24 knots the complexity of shutting down boilers and stowing funnels made them slow to dive.

As the speed of capital ships increased, the United Kingdom abandoned the fleet submarine concept following completion of three 21-knot River-class submarine submarines of the early 1930s using supercharged diesels, because the size required for range and surface speed decreased maneuverability.

=== Others ===
Continental European nations sometimes used the terms &quot;ocean-going&quot;, &quot;long-patrol&quot;, &quot;type 1&quot; or &quot;1st class&quot; submarines, generally referring to Atlantic or Indian Ocean operations in the absence of anticipated need for Pacific patrols, and often without the speed for fleet operations.

==Comparison of World War II submarines==

== Modern boats==
===United Kingdom===

Since the mid-1960s, the Royal Navy has used the term Fleet Submarine for its nuclear-powered attack submarines, distinguishing them from the ballistic missile submarines (and, in the 20th century, from the diesel-electric submarines, which it termed &#x27;Patrol Submarines&#x27;). 

The classes of Fleet Submarine currently in service are the &quot;Astute&quot;-class and &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class.

<doc id="663926" wikidata="Q4706388" url="?curid=663926" title="Alan Cobham">
<text>Sir Alan John Cobham, KBE, AFC (6 May 1894 – 21 October 1973) was an English aviation pioneer.

==Early life==
As a child he attended Wilson&#x27;s School, which was then in Camberwell, London. The school was relocated to the former site of Croydon Airport in 1975. 

After National Service and a short career at the Bar, Michael Cobham followed him into the Flight Refuelling business, and for many years was in charge of it.

==Career==
Alan Cobham began work as a teenage commercial apprentice in the City of London. He enjoyed the outdoors, and after completing his apprenticeship spent a year working on his uncle&#x27;s farm, hoping to make a career in estate management. After a brief return to London commercial work, in August 1914 he joined the British Army, and was directed to the Royal Army Veterinary Corps due to his farming experience. He served on the Western Front from 1914 to 1917. He dealt mainly with injured horses, and attained the rank of Staff Veterinary Sergeant. After transfer to the Royal Flying Corps and then the Royal Air Force, he became a Pilot Officer flying instructor.

After the war Cobham became a test pilot for the de Havilland aircraft company, and was the first pilot for the newly formed de Havilland Aeroplane Hire Service. In 1921 he made a 5,000-mile air tour of Europe, visiting 17 cities in three weeks. Between 16 November 1925 and 13 March 1926, he made a trip from London to Cape Town and return in his de Havilland DH.50, in which he had replaced the original Siddeley Puma engine with a more powerful, air-cooled Jaguar. On 30 June 1926, he set off on a flight from Britain (from the River Medway) to Australia, where 60,000 people swarmed across the grassy fields of Essendon Airport, Melbourne, when he landed his de Havilland DH.50 floatplane (it had been converted to a wheeled undercarriage earlier, at Darwin). During the flight to Australia, Cobham&#x27;s engineer of the D.H.50 aircraft, Arthur B. Elliot, was shot and killed after they left Baghdad on 5 July 1926. The return flight was undertaken over the same route. Cobham was knighted the same year.
On 25 November 1926, Cobham attempted but failed to be the first person to deliver mail to New York City by air from the east, planning to fly mail from the White Star ocean liner RMS &quot;Homeric&quot; in a de Havilland DH.60 Moth floatplane when the ship was about 12 hours from New York harbour on a westbound crossing from Southampton. After the Moth was lowered from the ship, however, Cobham was unable to take off owing to rough water and had to be towed into port by the ship. The same year Cobham was awarded the gold medal by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.

Cobham starred as himself in the 1927 British war film &quot;The Flight Commander&quot; directed by Maurice Elvey. In 1927–28 he flew a Short Singapore flying boat around the continent of Africa landing only in British territory. Cobham wrote his own contemporary accounts of his flights, and recalls them in his biography. The films &quot;With Cobham to the Cape&quot; (1926), &quot;Round Africa with Cobham&quot; (1928) and &quot;With Cobham to Kivu&quot; (1932) contain valuable footage of the flights. Recent commentaries contextualize his flights across the British Empire in the wider events and culture of the time.
In 1929 Cobham mounted his first tour of Britain, called the Municipal Aerodrome Campaign. This was an ambitious plan to encourage town councils to build local airports in the hope of drumming up business for his activities as an aviation consultant. Each event would start with free flights to local dignitaries followed by free flights for local schoolchildren, the latter funded by Sir Charles Wakefield, the founder of Castrol, who paid the fares for ten thousand such flights. The day would finish with as many paid-for pleasure flights as could be managed for the public, the income from which would pay his expenses and make him a profit. The tour visited 110 venues between May and October 1929 using a ten-passenger de Havilland DH.61 Giant Moth G-AAEV named Youth of Britain. Cobham declared the tour to have been a great success.

In 1932 he started the National Aviation Day displays – a combination of barnstorming and joyriding. This consisted of a team of up to fourteen aircraft, ranging from single-seaters to modern airliners, and many skilled pilots. It toured the country, calling at hundreds of sites, some of them regular airfields and some just fields cleared for the occasion. Generally known as &quot;Cobham&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, it was hugely popular, giving thousands of people their first experience of flying, and bringing &quot;air-mindedness&quot; to the population. In 1933 there were two simultaneous tours throughout the season, named Number 1 and Number 2. In 1935 there again were two, but only from 1 July, named Astra and Ferry. These continued until the end of the 1935 season. In the British winter of 1932–33, Cobham took his aerial circus to South Africa (with the mistaken view that it would be the first of its kind there). He closed the circus within weeks of a mid-air disaster in which two of his planes collided over Blackpool on 7 September 1935. The pilot of an Avro biplane, South African war veteran, Captain Hugh P Stewart and Blackpool sisters, Lilian and Doris Barnes were killed.
Cobham was also one of the founding directors of Airspeed Limited, the aircraft manufacturing company started by Nevil Shute Norway (perhaps better known as the famous novelist, Nevil Shute), together with the designer Hessell Tiltman; who, having been discharged by the Airship Guarantee Company (a subsidiary of Vickers) after the R101 disaster also caused the grounding of the more successful R100, decided to found their own small aircraft business. Cobham was an early and enthusiastic recruit: indeed, it was thanks to Sir Alan – who placed early orders for two &quot;Off Plan&quot; aircraft (the three-engined ten-seater Airspeed Ferry) for his National Aviation Day Limited company – that Airspeed managed to commence manufacturing at all.

Cobham&#x27;s early experiments with in-flight refuelling were based on a specially adapted Airspeed Courier. This craft was eventually modified by Airspeed to Cobham&#x27;s specification, for a non-stop flight from London to India, using in-flight refuelling to extend the aeroplane&#x27;s flight duration.

In 1935 he founded a small airline, Cobham Air Routes Ltd, that flew from London Croydon Airport to the Channel Islands. Months later, after a crash that killed one of his pilots, he sold it to Olley Air Service Ltd and turned to the development of inflight refueling. Trials stopped at the outbreak of World War II until interest was successfully revived by the RAF and United States Army Air Forces in the last year of the war.

He once remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s a full time job being Alan Cobham!&quot;

==Personal life==
In the summer of 1922 he married Gladys Lloyd, and they subsequently had two sons; Geoffrey (b.1925) and Michael (b.1927). Lady Cobham died in 1961 at the age of 63.

He retired to the British Virgin Islands, but returned to England, where he died in 1973.

==Legacy==
In 1997, Cobham was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

The company he formed is still active in the aviation industry as Cobham plc.

In 2015 the Royal Air Force Museum in London staged an exhibition about Cobham. In 2016 the RAF exhibited his Flying Circus.

In 2016 he was inducted into the Airlift/Tanker Association Hall of Fame.

<text>John Howard Francis Shattuck (born 22 September 1943) is an international legal scholar and human rights leader. He served as the fourth President and Rector of Central European University (CEU) from August 2009 until July 31, 2016. He is a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, and he joined the faculty of Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in January 2017.

==Biography==

Shattuck received a BA from Yale College in 1965, an MA in 1967 from Clare College, Cambridge University, with First Class Honors in International Law, and a JD degree in 1970 from Yale Law School. While at Yale and subsequently, Shattuck was an active member of the Yale Russian Chorus.

===Career===
His first position was National Staff Counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union 1971-76; he then served from 1976 to 1984 as Executive Director of the Washington office and national staff counsel, handling a number of prominent civil rights and liberties cases, including Halperin v. Kissinger,in which he took the deposition of former President Richard Nixon in 1976.

From 1984 to 1993 he was appointed by Harvard President Derek Bok to be vice president, government, community and public affairs, at Harvard University, and beginning in 1986 was also a Lecturer at Harvard Law School, and Senior Associate, Program on Science, Technology and Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School.

From 1993 to 1998, he was United States Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor under President Bill Clinton, where he played a key role in the establishment by the United Nations of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, working closely with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. In 1995, he was the first international diplomat to reach survivors of the Srebrenica genocide in Bosnia, assembling evidence for the UN Security Council vote authorizing NATO intervention in Bosnia. During this tenure, he met with Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng and the Chinese government used the meeting as a pretext to arrest Wei and re-imprison him.

Shattuck served as U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic from 1998 to 2000, assisting the Czech government in joining NATO and beginning to meet the requirements for becoming a member several years later of the European Union. Shattuck participated with US special envoy Richard Holbrooke in negotiating the Dayton Peace Agreement and other efforts to end the war in Bosnia.

In 2001 he became Chief Executive Officer of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, and in 2007 also a senior fellow at Tufts University, where he taught international relations. In 2001 and 2002, the Library and Foundation delivered a widely broadcast series of public events, &quot;Responding to Terrorism,&quot; that examined issues of international security and human rights following the September 11 attacks.

He was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board in 2003.

In August 2009 he became the fourth President and Rector of Central European University (CEU). He was also Professor of Legal Studies and International Relations, and taught an interdisciplinary course entitled &quot;U.S. Foreign Policy, Human Rights and The Rule of Law.&quot;

Under Shattuck&#x27;s leadership, CEU continued to pursue to its mission to promote open societies that respect human rights and the rule of law, introducing new initiatives in that direction. Protecting academic freedom and the autonomy of the university during an increasingly authoritarian government in Hungary were among Shattuck&#x27;s main priorities. At his initiative, CEU launched the Frontiers of Democracy Initiative in 2014, which brought together academics and practitioners from across the globe to explore what democracy means in an increasingly complex world.

Shattuck oversaw the introduction of cutting-edge interdisciplinary programs and initiatives into CEU&#x27;s academic program, such as cognitive science, network science, a religious studies specialization and the Humanities Initiative. CEU also embarked on a major redevelopment project of its downtown Budapest campus, completed in 2016. 
CEU&#x27;s academic excellence was recognized in recent university rankings, as CEU is constantly improving on its Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) rankings, with politics and international studies ranked as 29th in the world in 2015, and also featured in Times Higher Education&#x27;s Top 100. CEU also secured the most European Research Council Grants among the Central-Eastern European member states’ universities in the 2007-2013 period.

Following a seven-year tenure as CEU&#x27;s President and Rector, Shattuck stepped down on July 31, 2016. In his honor CEU established the Shattuck Center on Human Rights at the University&#x27;s Department of Public Policy. He became President Emeritus of CEU on August 1, and moved to Boston to become professor of practice at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and senior fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. At Fletcher in 2017 he helped initiate a joint masters degree program on transatlantic affairs between the Fletcher School and the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, and taught the foundational course, &quot;US-EU Relations: An interdisciplinary Analysis of Transatlantic Affairs,&quot; to students at both the Fletcher School and the College of Europe. At the Harvard Kennedy School Carr Center he directed a three-year initiative, &quot;Reimagining Rights and Responsibilities in the United States,&quot; which reviewed the state of rights and democracy and led to the publication of a major study co-authored by Shattuck, Sushma Raman and Mathias Risse in 2022, &quot;Holding Together: the Hijacking of Rights in America and How to Reclaim Them for Everyone.&quot;

==Publications ==

Shattuck is the author of three books: &quot;Holding Together: The Hijacking of Rights in America and How to Reclaim Them for Everyone&quot;, co-authored with Sushma Raman and Mathias Risse and Published by The New Press in 2022, about contemporary attacks on human rights and democracy in the US, &quot;Freedom on Fire: Human Rights Wars and America’s Response&quot;, published by Harvard University Press in 2003, about the international response to genocide and other crimes against humanity in the 1990s, that, according to WorldCat, is held in 1636 libraries and the textbook &quot;Rights of Privacy&quot;, published by National Textbook Co. in 1977, and held in 515 libraries. He has also written many book chapters, and more than 50 articles.

==Recognition==
He has received honorary degrees from Kenyon College, the University of Rhode Island, the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, and the University of West Bohemia. He received the Ambassador&#x27;s Award from the American Bar Association Central and East European Law Initiative, the Human Rights Award from the United Nations Association of Boston, and the Yale Law School Public Service Award. In 2007, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>In the mythology of the Western and Central Torres Strait Islanders, Kibukuth &quot;Horizon&#x27;s End&quot; (abbreviated form Kibu) is the mythical land of the ancestoral spirits and the awgadhal &quot;totemic gods&quot;, believed to exist beyond the sky dome (dapar) surrounding the world, with its main entrance over the horizon far to the west. 

==Meaning==
The basic meaning of the word &quot;kibu&quot; is midpoint of an upright broad object, such as small of back, mid-slope of a hill, and horizon. The world is envisaged as like an upturned half-coconut shell (a hemisphere) with the bottom part being the earth covered by the overarching sky. 

==Features==
The common reference of Kibukuth, and its abbreviation Kibu to the land of the &quot;markai&quot; (the spirits of people who have travelled to Kibu after death) is a specialised, religious use of the word. Traditional Torres Strait religion can be characterised as totemic with a form ancestor worship, and as such the &quot;markai&quot; are the ancestors, and are specially revered. Kibukuth is made up of different totemic territories, those of &quot;kœdal&quot; &quot;crocodile&quot;, &quot;thabu&quot; &quot;snake&quot;, &quot;baidham&quot; &quot;shark&quot;, &quot;samu&quot; &quot;cassowary&quot;, &quot;kursi&quot; &quot;hammer-head shark&quot;, &quot;dhœibaw&quot; &quot;wild white yam&quot;, among many others. After death, the &quot;mari&quot; &quot;soul&quot; travels to Boigu, just past which it becomes a &quot;markai&quot;, and is met by &quot;markai&quot; relatives who have come to take it to the &quot;augadh&quot; territory. The &quot;augadh&quot; generates the &quot;buwai&quot; &quot;totemic clan/moiety&quot;. 

In the traditional mythology, the world (&quot;arkath&quot; &quot;hole/pit&quot;, &quot;apagoewa&quot; &quot;underfurrow/ditch/garden&quot;, &quot;guguwabthiyaizinga&quot; &quot;coiled-up abject&quot;, &quot;sama&quot; &quot;food ball&quot;) is at the bottom of a hemi-sphere, with the sky-dome (&quot;dapar&quot;) above and around it. The &quot;markai&quot; live in &quot;Kibukuth&quot; &quot;Horizons End&quot;, the main gateway of which is in the west. However, the &quot;markai&quot; often come back to visit. Kibukuth actually surrounds the world, so &quot;markai&quot; can be seen passing from east to west as well as west to east, coming down from the sky, and sometimes even coming up from under the ground via &quot;Apangab&quot; &quot;Netherway/Underway&quot;, the mythical pathway under the earth used by &quot;markai&quot; and others, such as &quot;dhogai&quot; &quot;long-eared witch women&quot;, &quot;maidhalaig&quot; &quot;magic-men&quot;, and others to travel under the earth and the sea from place to place.

Before becoming &quot;markai&quot;, the spirit is called a &quot;mari&quot;. &quot;Mari&quot; are the souls of people while still alive ort just after death. The passage to the other side is made on sand banks just west of Boigu, in north-west Torres Strait. At Boigu, the &quot;mari&quot; either leave a sign or otherwise talk to the &quot;mariumulaimœbaig&quot; &quot;spirit talker&quot;, to let people know how he or she died, and if he or she was murdered (and if so, who killed them). This is done where the cemetery is at Boigu, just west of the village. Previously, the &quot;mari&quot; of certain &quot;buwai&quot; did this at Thuwam, another sacred site in western Boigu.

==Kibukuth and relations with other peoples==
In the passage over to the other side, at the sandbanks west of Boigu, the mari, which is black (&quot;kubikub&quot;) just as in life, becomes white (&quot;gamulnga&quot;) (this is a belief common to many Pacific and Australian peoples). Therefore, when Asians and Europeans visited Torres Strait, they were at first believed to be &quot;markai&quot; returning. In the modern language, &quot;markai&quot; is still often used to refer to Europeans, though no longer to Asians. However, this is considered to be impolite, and the correct term is either &quot;Yurupau Mœbaig&quot; &quot;European&quot; or &quot;Gamulmœbaig&quot; &quot;(Light) Coloured Person&quot;.

One favourite means of transport of the &quot;markai&quot; is the &quot;markaigub&quot; &quot;spirit wind&quot;, that is to say, waterspouts, which appear in the North-West Monsoon season, the favourite time for the &quot;markai&quot; to come to the world. As this was the season the Makkasarese and similar Indonesian fishermen came to Northern Australia, they were associated with the &quot;markai&quot;. Waterspouts are also called &quot;markaibaywa&quot; or &quot;markaibaw&quot; (diakect differences), or &quot;baaywa&quot; / &quot;baw&quot; for short; that is to say &quot;markai&quot; spear, &quot;baaywa&quot;/&quot;baw&quot; being a special word for spear. The &quot;markaibaywa&quot; are seen as the spears the &quot;markai&quot; use to hunt turtle and dugong.

<text>A taula (meaning &#x27;table&#x27; in Catalan) is a Stonehenge-esque stone monument found on the Balearic island of Menorca. Taulas can be up to 5 metres high and consist of a vertical pillar (a monolith or several smaller stones on top of each other) with a horizontal stone lying on it. A U-shaped wall often encloses the structure.

They were built by the Talaiotic culture between 500 BC and 300 BC.

Their exact cultural meaning remains unknown, but they probably had religious and/or astronomical purposes. Most of the taulas face south, which seems to suggest some astronomical meaning. Archeologist Michael Hoskin has suggested the taulas may have been part of an ancient healing cult. They are frequently found near talaiots.

The first author who wrote about these structures was Juan Ramis in his book &quot;Antigüedades célticas de la isla de Menorca&quot; (&quot;Celtic Antiquities of the Island of Menorca&quot;), which was published 1818, being the first book in the Spanish language entirely devoted to Prehistory.

Examples include those at Torre Trencada, Talatí de Dalt, Torrellissá Nou, Trepucó, and the site at Torralba d&#x27;en Salord.

<text>William Michael Daley (born August 8, 1948) is an American lawyer, politician and former banker who served as the 24th White House Chief of Staff from January 2011 to January 2012 under President Barack Obama. Prior to this, he served as the 32nd U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 1997 to 2000 under President Bill Clinton. 

He has also served on the executive committee of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Daley was a candidate for Governor of Illinois in the 2014 gubernatorial election until dropping out of the race on September 16, 2013. He ran in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election but came in third in the first-round voting and did not advance to the runoff. He served as the vice Chairman of BNY Mellon from June through October 2019. From 2019 to 2023, Daley served as the Vice Chairman of Public Affairs for Wells Fargo.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Chicago, the seventh and youngest child of the late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and Eleanor &quot;Sis&quot; Daley. He is the brother of former Illinois legislator John P. Daley and former Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley.

He graduated from St. Ignatius College Prep in 1966, with a B.A. degree from Loyola University Chicago, and a J.D. degree from John Marshall Law School. Daley later accepted an honorary Doctor of Law degree from John Marshall Law School. He practiced law privately with the firm Daley and George, except for a duration between 1977 and 1980, in which he sat on the Advisory Council of Economic Opportunity.

==Professional career==
He became associated with Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, where he was first vice chairman (1989–1990) and then president and chief operating officer (1990–1993). Daley returned to the practice of law, as a partner with the firm Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt from 1993 to 1997.

Daley was appointed to the board of Fannie Mae in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, serving until 1997.

Daley was U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 1997 to 2000. Among other things, Secretary Daley helped usher in the age of E-commerce, ran the 2000 census, expanded minority business development programs, and oversaw a wide range of economic initiatives during one of the strongest economic periods in American history, adding an estimated 23 million jobs. Daley stepped down to run Al Gore&#x27;s campaign for president in 2000.

In December 2001, Daley was appointed to a newly created position as President of SBC Communications to help reform the company&#x27;s image. In May 2004, Daley was appointed Midwest Chairman of JPMorgan Chase, following its acquisition of Bank One Corporation. In 2007, Daley was appointed as head of the Corporate Responsibility program, a position he held until 2010. Daley formerly served on the Board of Directors of Boeing, Merck &amp; Co., Boston Properties, and Loyola University Chicago. He is currently a trustee of Northwestern University and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2010, he received the Chicago History Museum &quot;Making History Award&quot; for Distinction in Civic Leadership. In 2014, he joined Argentiere Capital as a managing partner.

On November 7, 2019, it was announced that Daley had been appointed to serve as head of Public Affairs at Wells Fargo effective November 13, 2019, and will also serve as one of the company&#x27;s Vice Chairman. His appointment went into effect as scheduled.

==Political career==
Daley managed his brother Richard&#x27;s successful campaign in the 1980 Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney election. This victory helped establish the Daley family&#x27;s enduring political influence in Chicago and Cook County politics. William Daley continued to play a key role in his brother&#x27;s political campaigns and governance throughout Richard&#x27;s tenure as Mayor of Chicago.

===Clinton administration===
In 1993, William M. Daley was appointed Special Counsel to President Bill Clinton. In this role, Daley was instrumental in advocating for and securing the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He coordinated efforts between the White House, members of Congress, and private industry to ensure bipartisan support for the agreement. His work on NAFTA showcased his ability to navigate complex political landscapes and cemented his reputation as a skilled negotiator and policymaker.

In 1997, Daley was appointed Secretary of Commerce by President Clinton, serving until the end of Clinton’s second term in 2000. As Secretary, Daley focused on promoting U.S. exports, expanding trade opportunities, and fostering public-private partnerships to spur economic growth. One of his key accomplishments was working to enhance the United States competitive position in global markets by advocating for free trade policies and modernizing trade infrastructure.

===Presidential politics===
Daley resigned as commerce secretary to become general chairman of Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s presidential campaign, replacing Tony Coelho. He was portrayed in the HBO film &quot;Recount&quot;, about the Florida election recount of the 2000 presidential election, by actor Mitch Pileggi.

During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, Daley was a prominent supporter of Barack Obama. On November 5, 2008, Daley was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.

===Obama administration===

On January 6, 2011, President Barack Obama named Daley as his next White House Chief of Staff, and he took office on January 13, 2011. Daley succeeded Rahm Emanuel, who served as chief of staff during the first two years of the president&#x27;s term and left the position in October 2010 to run to succeed Daley&#x27;s brother as Mayor of Chicago, and Pete Rouse, who was serving as the interim chief of staff.

In March 2011, speaking for the Obama administration on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Daley said the administration would consider using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if rising oil prices caused by Arab Spring threaten the U.S. economy. Daley said Obama &quot;is very concerned; we&#x27;re trying to look at all the possible options.&quot; He repeated the administration&#x27;s stance that there is enough output capacity in the world to deal with any disruptions from Libya.
Daley was photographed in the White House Situation Room photograph taken on May 1, 2011, by Pete Souza. Later in May 2011, he was part of the Presidential State Visit to the United Kingdom.

In October 2011, Daley said he planned to return home to Chicago after President Obama made it through his re-election. &quot;I made a commitment to put the president through his re-election, which I&#x27;m confident he will do, and then my wife and I will be back in Chicago.&quot;

On January 9, 2012, it was announced that Daley would resign as Obama&#x27;s chief of staff. Jack Lew was announced as his successor.

===Post-Obama administration===
Just after the 2012 presidential election, in the November 8, 2012, issue of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Daley was reported as considering a run in the 2014 election for Governor of Illinois. Daley said &quot;I&#x27;ve thought about it before and I don&#x27;t take it off the table. I think right now, to be very frank with you, the last thing in the world anybody wants to hear about is a race that&#x27;s two years down the road.&quot;

Daley further was quoted as saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not closing the door and, I know that sounds like a politician, but the fact of the matter is that these are tough days and I think there&#x27;s a lot to be done by the Legislature. I don&#x27;t think it helps right now for people to be out there saying they&#x27;re going to run and they have a solution at this point. I think we&#x27;ve got to see what the Legislature does.&quot;

====2014 Illinois gubernatorial campaign====
On June 10, 2013, Daley announced via YouTube that he would launch an exploratory committee to run for Governor of Illinois. On July 2, 2013, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Daley for governor. On July 30, 2013, Daley filed documents declaring himself an official candidate to challenge incumbent Governor Pat Quinn in the 2014 Democratic primary. On September 16, 2013, Daley made a surprise announcement that he was exiting the race due to the personal hardships inherent in running a campaign for elected office.

After the election, Bill Daley served as co-chair of the transition team for the incoming Rauner Administration.

In 2018, Daley served as the head of finances for the campaign of gubernatorial candidate Chris Kennedy.

====2019 Chicago mayoral campaign====
After two-term mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he would not seek reelection, it was reported on September 14, 2018, that Daley would run for mayor of Chicago.

Daley&#x27;s candidacy made the 2019 election the fourteenth Chicago mayoral election in which a member of his family has been a candidate. William&#x27;s father won the 1955, 1959, 1963, 1967, 1971, and the 1975 elections. His brother won the 1989, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and the 2007 elections, and was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1983 election. This means that a member of the Daley family participated in all but four of the eighteen Chicago mayoral elections held between 1955 and 2019 (with no member of the Daley family having run in the 1979, 1987, 2011, or the 2015 elections).

Among the positions Daley took was support of the city exploring the potential implementation of a commuter tax. He also proposed reducing the size of the Chicago City Council from 50 members to 15.

Daley was one of four mayoral candidates (alongside Gery Chico, Susana Mendoza, and Toni Preckwinkle) that had ties to Alderman Edward M. Burke, whose corruption scandal upended the race for mayor. However, Daley&#x27;s ties were weaker than the other three, and thus, he was perceived to have suffered the least amount of damage from the scandal of the four.

Daley carried support from the city&#x27;s business community.

Daley&#x27;s campaign received endorsements from the editorial boards of the Chicago Tribune, Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business, and The Chicago Crusader. He received the endorsement of Plumbers Local Union 130 He also received endorsements from politicians Al Gore, Emil Jones, Joseph P. Kennedy II, and Bobby Rush.

Daley&#x27;s campaign placed an emphasis on fundraising. Daley vastly out-fundraised his opponents. A significant financial contributor to Daley&#x27;s campaign was Illinois billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin. Griffin&#x27;s financial support of Daley&#x27;s campaign proved controversial for Daley, largely because Griffin had also been a major financial backer of the failed 2018 reelection campaign of Republican former Illinois governor Bruce Rauner.

Daley&#x27;s strong fundraising enabled him to run highly visible advertising.

Daley ran a weaker field operation than some other candidates did.

In the last several weeks of the campaign, Daley began to rise in the polls. However, he also began to be the subject of attack ads run by the union-affiliated Fight Back for a Better Tomorrow Super PAC. At the end of the election campaign, polls showed Daley having strong prospects of finishing near the top of the field.

Daley placed third in the election, failing to advance to the runoff. He won 82,294 votes, 14.78% the overall votes cast in the first round. The margin between him and second-place finisher Toni Preckwinkle was 7,049 votes.

==Personal life==
In 2010, Daley married Bernadette Keller. Keller is an organ donor. She is a founding member and director of the Chicago Transplant Ethics Consortium. 

In 2006, Keller bought a 2,052-square-foot apartment in the Park Tower on North Michigan Avenue for $1.48 million. The couple sold the unit in 2015 for $1.4 million. They currently live in a four-bedroom condo on North Lake Shore Drive.

He has four children. His three adult children and three granddaughters all live in Chicago.

<text>Frank Eugene &quot;Hill&quot; Harper (born May 17, 1966) is an American actor and political candidate. He is known for his roles as Dr. Sheldon Hawkes in &quot;&quot;, Agent Spelman Boyle in &quot;Limitless&quot;, and Dr. Marcus Andrews in &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;.

Harper was a candidate in the Democratic Primary in the 2024 United States Senate election in Michigan to fill the seat of retiring incumbent Senator Debbie Stabenow.

==Early life and education==
Harper was born in Iowa City, Iowa, the son of two medical doctors, Harry D. Harper, a psychiatrist, and Marilyn Harper (née Hill), who was one of the first black practicing anesthesiologists in the United States and co-authored a book called &quot;Wearing Purple&quot;. Born Frank Eugene Harper, he adopted the name &quot;Hill&quot; as a tribute to both his maternal and paternal ancestors.

Harper graduated magna cum laude from Brown University in 1988, with a BA degree in economics and sociology and was valedictorian of his department. In 1992, he graduated with a JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School. He received an MPA degree with honors from John F. Kennedy School at Harvard University. During his years at Harvard, he was a full-time member of Boston&#x27;s Black Folks Theater Company, one of the oldest and most acclaimed black theater troupes in the country.

While a student at Harvard, Harper befriended Barack Obama, with whom he played basketball. In 2012, Harper was appointed to The President&#x27;s Cancer Panel, a three-member body assigned to work with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and make recommendations to the White House around cancer policy.

He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. He has received eight honorary degrees, including honorary doctorates from both Westfield State College and Howard University.

==Acting career==

His profile subsequently rose on both the mainstream and independent film circuits, thanks to roles in films ranging from &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998) to the independent romantic comedy &quot;Loving Jezebel&quot; (1999) to &quot;The Skulls&quot; (2000). Harper did some of his most acclaimed work in Jordan Walker-Pearlman&#x27;s &quot;The Visit&quot; (2000), an independent drama in which he starred as a prisoner dying of AIDS who tries to put his life back together. He also portrayed Leshem in the 2010 Syfy original movie &quot;Stonehenge Apocalypse&quot;.

In February 2013, it was announced that &quot;CSI: NY&quot; would be ending and Harper would be joining the cast of &quot;Covert Affairs&quot; as a series regular.

From April 21, 2015, to May 10, 2015, Harper starred as &quot;Hard Rock&quot; in the Off-Broadway play &quot;ToasT&quot;. The play (produced by Lemon Andersen and co-starred Keith David) is set in the Attica Prison around the time of its 1971 prison riot and tells of the lives of its prisoners using poetic prose.

From May 1, 2018, to June 17, 2018, Harper starred as &quot;Rooftop&quot; in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Our Lady of 121st Street&quot;. This dark comedy (written by Stephen Adly Guirgis and directed by Phylicia Rashad) is about former students paying their respects to Sister Rose, only to find that Sister Rose&#x27;s body has been stolen.

Hill Harper&#x27;s acting career also includes voice-over work (or voice acting) with &quot;&quot;, &quot;Breathe Bible&quot;, plus, podcasts called &quot;Legal Wars&quot; and &quot;5-Factor Authentication&quot;.

He ran to the left of U.S. Representative Elissa Slotkin, describing himself as the &quot;most progressive candidate in the field.&quot; Harper touted his support for universal healthcare and the abolition of the filibuster, and if elected, would be the only U.S. senator who is also a union member, due to his membership in SAG-AFTRA.

Harper gained attention in November 2023, after announcing that he had declined an offer of $20 million in campaign contributions that would have been contingent upon him dropping out of the Senate race and mounting a primary challenge against U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib. He has called for a &quot;humanitarian ceasefire&quot; in Gaza. On August 6, 2024, Harper was defeated in the Democratic Primary by Slotkin.

<doc id="663942" wikidata="Q617600" url="?curid=663942" title="Heavier Than Heaven">
<text>Heavier Than Heaven is a 2001 biography of musician Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana. It was written by Charles R. Cross.

For the book, Cross desired to create the definitive Cobain biography, and over four years conducted 400+ interviews; in particular, he was granted exclusive interviews and access to Cobain&#x27;s private journals, lyrics and photos, by his widow Courtney Love. Notably, neither Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl nor Cobain&#x27;s mother contributed to the book.

Cross took the name &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot; from a tour Nirvana did with the band Tad in the United Kingdom. The lead singer, Tad Doyle, was very obese; the name which was thought up by the tour promoters, was meant in part to poke fun at the inaccurate idea that Tad alone weighed more than all of the members of Nirvana put together.
==Reception==
While arguably the most complete Cobain biography, Cross opted to include his own impression of what Cobain&#x27;s final days were like. Several people questioned the inclusion of fiction in what was claimed to be a non-fiction book. At the same time, Cross&#x27; desire for the book to be as complete as possible meant that he occasionally accepted secondhand (and incorrect) information as fact. The book was criticized as being a collaboration between Love and Cross by friends. Cross also did not interview Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. However, beyond the criticism, the book contained many details about Cobain and Nirvana&#x27;s career that had otherwise gone unnoted.

==Proposed film version==
David Benioff was hired by Universal Pictures in October 2007 to write a screenplay based on the Charles R. Cross biography. Courtney Love was to serve as executive producer with Marc Forster showing interest in directing. However, in March 2009, Forster said that he was not going to direct the film but expressed hopes that it would be done well. In 2014, it was reported that the film was still going ahead. However, as of 2023 there is no news on whether or not the movie will be released.

<doc id="663947" wikidata="Q127424" url="?curid=663947" title="1st Parachute Division (Germany)">
<text>The 1st Parachute Division () was an elite German military parachute-landing division that fought during World War II. A division of paratroopers was termed a &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; Division. For reasons of secrecy, it was originally raised as the 7th Air Division (), before being renamed and reorganized as the 1st Parachute Division in 1943.

==Operational history==
The division was formed in October 1938 under the command of Major-General Kurt Student. At the start of World War II, the division contained two parachute regiments; it was brought up to full strength in 1941. In April 1940, the division took part in the invasion of Denmark and Norway during Operation Weserübung, successfully seizing several airfields.

The German plan for the invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands in May 1940 called for the use of the 7th Fliegerdivision to aid in the advance through the capture of key bridges and the fortress of Eben Emael.
The invasion of the Netherlands included the majority of the 7th Fliegerdivision in cooperation with the 22nd Air Landing Division. This force was grouped as the 11th Fliegerkorps, and commanded by Kurt Student. The attack on The Hague was a failure: the high loss of transport planes grew to quite dramatic proportions. Many paratroopers and air landing troops were captured, hundreds were killed or wounded and 1,536 prisoners of both divisions were transported to England. (The Rotterdam Blitz on 14 May 1940 led to Rotterdam&#x27;s surrender.) The Eben Emael assault was a complete success with both the fort itself and 1,000+ enemy captured.

The division took part in the Battle of Crete. The Allied forces on the island put up a stubborn defense and the troops of the 7th Fliegerdivision took heavy losses. With the aid of the follow-on reinforcements, and the capture of the Maleme airfield allowing resupply however, the Allies were forced to evacuate the island by 29 May.

In September 1941, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front, fighting in the vicinity of Leningrad, Stalino and later taking part in anti-partisan warfare near Smolensk. In the summer of 1942, the division was transferred to France where it trained for the planned capture of Malta. After this operation was cancelled, elements of the division saw combat in North Africa.

The division took part in the July 1943 fight against the Allied invasion of Sicily. For the remainder of the war, the division fought in the Italian Campaign. From 14–27 December 1943, the division, under General-Lieutenant Richard Heidrich, saw action against the 1st Canadian Division in the Battle of Ortona. Later the division was concentrated in the defense of the Winter Line south of Rome, defending against the advance of the British Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese. In February to May 1944, the 1st Parachute Division took part in the Battle of Monte Cassino, and in late May and June it fought against the Allied Operation Diadem later retreating to the north of Rome. They formed part of the German I Parachute Corps, along with the German 4th Parachute Division.

By January 1945, the German I Parachute Corps was deployed to the Adriatic coast behind the Senio Rivier. The Allied advance resumed on 8 April, and the 1st Parachute Division was forced into a steady withdrawal toward the Po River by the British Eighth Army. Elements of the Polish II Corps captured the 1st Parachute Division’s battle flag, and on the morning of April 21, the 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division entered Bologna ahead of the American 34th Division. By 25 April, the division had completed the river crossing. They immediately set off on a final march toward the Alpine Mountains. Finally, the German surrender in Italy came on 2 May 1945, and included the men of the 1st Parachute Division. The unconditional surrender of Germany followed a week later.

== War crimes ==
Members of various units of the division committed war crimes in Italy between 1943 and 1945. A massacre by members of the 1. Fallschirmjäger Regiment occurred on November 21, 1943, in Pietransieri, a frazione of Roccaraso in Abruzzo. A total of 128 unarmed civilians, mostly women and children, were slaughtered in the . After they refused to leave the village, civilians were rounded up and executed by gunfire and explosives and their farms were set on fire and demolished. According to a project funded by the German federal government and led by a commission of historians &quot;Atlante delle Stragi Naziste e Fasciste in Italia&quot; (Atlas of the Nazi and Fascist Massacres in Italy), nearly 400 Italian civilians were murdered by members of the 1st Parachute Division by the end of the war.

<doc id="663948" wikidata="Q6859151" url="?curid=663948" title="List of island countries">
<text>This is a list of island countries. An island is a landmass (smaller than a continent) that is surrounded by water. Many island countries are spread over an archipelago, as is the case with Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines—these countries consist of thousands of islands. Others consist of a single island, such as Barbados, Dominica, and Nauru; a main island and some smaller islands, such as Cuba, Iceland, and Sri Lanka; a part of an island, such as Brunei, the Dominican Republic, East Timor, and the Republic of Ireland; or one main island but also sharing borders in other islands, such as the United Kingdom (Great Britain and a part of Ireland).

The list also includes two states in free association with New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Niue, as well as two states with limited diplomatic recognition which have &quot;de facto&quot; control over territories entirely on the islands, Northern Cyprus and Taiwan. In total, 50 island countries have been included in the lists.

Australia is not included as it is considered a continental country, although it was historically referred to as an island country because of its lack of land borders. Greenland is generally considered as the largest island on Earth and listed among the island territories. Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea is officially an unincorporated territory of the United States. Neither Greenland nor Puerto Rico are sovereign countries.

Indonesia is the world&#x27;s largest island country by area (1,904,569 km2), and by total number of islands (17,504 islands). It is also the world&#x27;s most populous island country, with a population of over 270 million (the fourth most populous country in the world, after India, China, and the United States).

South America has only one independent sovereign island nation with Trinidad and Tobago; though considered a Caribbean island country, it is located on the northern portion of the South American continental shelf just off Venezuela, but from Grenada, the nearest of the Antilles.

<text>The Mayor of the City of Dallas is a member of the Dallas City Council and its presiding officer. The current mayor is Eric Johnson, who has served one term since 2019 and is the 60th mayor to serve in the position. Dallas operates under a city charter that designates the mayor as the official head of city government and a council-manager system where a city council-appointed city manager serves as the chief operating officer of the city.

==Duties and powers==
The city of Dallas operates under a council-manager government type, putting the city of Dallas in a unique position as being one of the largest cities in the United States to utilize this municipal government structure. Unlike the more common form of government used by large cities known as the mayor-council government - where the mayor serves the chief-executive position of the city - the council-manager government of the city of Dallas gives the operational responsibility to the appointed City Manager. The mayor presides over city council meetings and official ceremonies and serves as a representative of the City of Dallas at the local, state, national, and international level. Likewise, it is not uncommon for mayors of the city of Dallas to simultaneously serve as members or heads of other committees while in office, further representing the interests of the people and city of Dallas in organizations and committees.

==History==
The Office of Mayor was created with the formation of the Dallas City Charter in 1856, also providing for the mayor six aldermen, a treasurer, recorder and a constable. In the charter, it was stated that each office would be elected for a term of one year. In the reorganization of 1876, the mayor was elected to the office for a term of two years. The office was first filled in the election of 1856, in which Dr. Samuel B. Pryor defeated A. D. Rice for the position. A. D. Rice would run for office again and go on to serve as the 4th mayor of the city.

For much of the 19th century, mayors of the city of Dallas served for only one term. This precedence was broken at the end of Winship C. Connor&#x27;s term, who – after serving three consecutive terms from 1887 to 1894 – would go on to be the city&#x27;s longest consecutively serving mayor in the 19th century. His success was accredited to the development of the city&#x27;s first water, power, and streetcar systems.

The municipal government of Dallas underwent two significant structural changes during its history. The first change was made in 1907 where the city voted to change from an alderman system to a commission form of government. Stephen J. Hay was the first mayor elected in this new form of government, demonstrating the success of the highly debated commission form of government and contributing to the development of White Rock Lake in response to a water shortage in 1910. The second major government change was made in 1930, altering the commission form of government to specifically be a council-manager form. The first mayor to serve following this change was Tom Bradford, a successful grocer who was a significant financial contributor to the Bradford Memorial Hospital for Babies, the preliminary institution to the Children&#x27;s Medical Center Dallas. He died after suffering a major heart attack in 1932 and was the first mayor of Dallas to die in office.

Woodall Rodgers, serving two 4 year terms from 1939 to 1947, was mayor during World War II and served during the rampant manufacturing of aircraft and weapon goods in a rapidly industrializing Dallas. Rodgers oversaw the initial transformation of Dallas Love Field from a USAAF training ground to a commercial airport. He was also mayor when the Mercantile National Bank Building was constructed, which was the only skyscraper built in the United States during World War II and was the tallest building in the city of Dallas until the completion of Republic Center Tower I in 1954. The economic success brought by his contributions in office are commemorated by several namesakes throughout the city, most notably the Woodall Rodgers Freeway that passes underneath Klyde Warren Park and over the Trinity River along the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge.

Earle Cabell served as 48th mayor from 1961 to 1964 and was mayor during the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in the city. In the wake of the assassination, Cabell was the target of multiple death threats and accusations of his involvement in the act.

The image of the city of Dallas was immensely tarnished by the assassination of the President, earning the moniker &quot;City of Hate&quot;. Following Earle Cabell was Mayor J. Erik Jonsson who funded and supported the then proposed Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. As mayor, he went on to support public works projects such as developing the new Dallas City Hall, the Dallas Convention Center, and the Dallas Central Library - the last of which is now named in his honor. He was followed by Wes Wise who went on to further improve the city&#x27;s image during his three terms as mayor from 1971 to 1976. However, he stepped down to pursue a political career in United States Congress before the end of his third term. His pro-term mayoral successor, Adlene Harrison, stepped in and became acting mayor for the remainder of his term. She was the city&#x27;s first female mayor, and the first female Jewish mayor in the United States. Although Dianne Feinstein is officially recognized as the first female Jewish mayor in the United States, Adlene Harrison&#x27;s position as acting mayor predates Feinstein&#x27;s start in office by almost two years; Adlene began serving as acting mayor on February 11, 1976, while Feinstein took office on December 4, 1978. Adlene would go on to serve as a member of several environmental committees and organizations after her short tenure, including the Environmental Protection Agency.

Ron Kirk was the first African-American mayor of the City of Dallas and served two terms from 1995 to 2002. As mayor, he led several efforts advocating for race equality and social welfare, mitigated tension between City Council and the Dallas School Board, advocated for economic development, and oversaw the construction of the American Airlines Center. He would later step down to pursue a seat in the US Senate, where he lost in the 2002 election to John Cornyn. After his defeat, he went on to become a lobbyist before being nominated and appointed by President Barack Obama to serve as United States Trade Representative from 2009 to 2013.

Laura Miller - the city&#x27;s third female mayor, following Adlene Harrison and Annette Strauss - was instrumental in renegotiating the Wright Amendment to revise flight restrictions at Love Field Airport, as well as implementing a citywide smoking ban and an ordinance prohibiting sex-based discrimination. The following mayor Tom Leppert would impose a staunch crime-fighting policy, promote the economic development of a modern inland port, and was a vocal supporter of a controversial convention center hotel project at the peak of the 2008 recession. He would later vacate the office to pursue a US Senate campaign in 2012, of which he would place third in the runoff. Following the four-month incumbency of acting mayor Dwaine Caraway, mayor Mike Rawlings would be known for his vocal leadership during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, and the removal of confederate monuments following the Charlottesville riots.

<text>Be (Б б or Ƃ, δ; italics: &quot;Б б or Ƃ, δ&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the voiced bilabial plosive , like the English pronunciation of in &quot;ball&quot;. It should not be confused with the Cyrillic letter Ve (В в), which is shaped like Latin capital letter B but represents the voiced labiodental fricative or the voiced bilabial fricative . The Cyrillic letter Б (Be) is romanized using the Latin letter B.

==History==
The Cyrillic letters Be and Ve (В в) were both derived from the Greek letter Beta (Β β).

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet the name of the letter Be was (&quot;buky/буки&quot;), meaning &quot;letter&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, the letter Be had no numeric value because the letter Ve inherited the Greek letter Beta&#x27;s numeric value.

==Form==
The Russian small letter б (be) is similar (but not identical) in shape to the digit 6. Its lowercase form also somewhat resembles a lowercase letter B (&quot;b&quot;), the letter to which it corresponds in the Latin alphabet. After all, the lowercase letter B (&quot;b&quot;) developed from scribal alterations to the capital letter B (&quot;B&quot;), just as б did from scribal alterations to the capital letter В (&quot;Ve&quot;).
In Serbian and Macedonian the italic form is allowed to vary, but the regular should look like in other languages.

The cursive form of the lowercase letter Be resembles the lowercase Greek letter Delta (δ), but they are slightly different in their upper portions.

==Usage==

In Russian and Bulgarian, the letter Be generally represents the voiced bilabial plosive , but word-finally or before a voiceless consonant, it also represents the voiceless . Before a palatalizing vowel, it represents . In Macedonian, the letter represents the sound , but if it is in the final position of the word, it is pronounced as , like in (&#x27;bread&#x27;).

In Mari, it may represent either /b/ or the voiced bilabial fricative .

In Serbian, the letter represents the voiced bilabial plosive /b/, regardless of the position in the word.

<text>Hornby Hobbies Limited is a British-owned scale model manufacturing company which has been focused on model railways. Its roots date back to 1901 in Liverpool, when founder Frank Hornby received a patent for his Meccano construction toy. The first clockwork train was produced in 1920. In 1938, Hornby launched its first OO gauge train. In 1964, Hornby and Meccano were bought by their competitor, Tri-ang Railways, and sold when Tri-ang went into receivership. Hornby Railways became independent again in the 1980s, and became listed on the London Stock Exchange, but due to financial troubles reported in June 2017, became majority owned by British turnaround specialist Phoenix Asset Management.

Hornby Hobbies bought model paint manufacturer Humbrol and their scale model kit subsidiary Airfix in 2007. The die-cast model car brand Corgi was added in 2008.

Hornby&#x27;s other brands include for model railways Bassett-Lowke, Jouef, Lima, Rivarossi and Electrotren, the large scale car model kit Pocher, and the scale car racing Scalextric.

==History==

===Early history: 1920–1938 ===
Hornby was at first a trade name for the railway productions of Meccano Ltd and based around Liverpool. Until 1907 the company produced under the name of &quot;Mechanics made easy&quot;. Hornby released its first train, a clockwork 0 gauge (1:48) model, in 1920. An electric train soon followed but was under-designed and the few that were made were sold in France. In 1925, a much more successful electric model was introduced, operating on the high voltage of 110 volts AC power.

Safety concerns saw low voltage 4V and then 6V motors introduced, followed by a reliable 20V AC system, which was developed in the early 1930s. However, clockwork remained the mainstay of the Hornby 0 gauge trains until 1937 and became the only power available in Liverpool-made 0 gauge trains from 1949. Competitors in the UK were Leeds Model Company and Bassett-Lowke.

A factory was established in France, which developed its own range of French outline trains, but Liverpool dominated export activity elsewhere, with large numbers of Hornby trains exported to Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Scandinavia. Even though the export models were often painted in &#x27;foreign&#x27; liveries, Hornby trains looked very British. Hornby attempted to break into the American market by setting up a factory in 1927 in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to make American-style trains.

These were colourful and attractive, but low-market and only clockwork. They probably would have failed in the marketplace because several established U.S. firms could undercut them and Hornby offered no better-class goods or electric models, but the Wall Street crash precipitated matters. In late 1929, Meccano Ltd. sold its New Jersey factory to the A. C. Gilbert Company and Hornby trains had vanished from the U.S. market by 1930. The leftover inventory was sold in Canada and in the UK and some of the tooling was reused for products in other markets.

===Hornby Dublo era: 1938–1963===
Meccano introduced its OO scale trains in 1938 under the name &#x27;Hornby Dublo&#x27;. The locomotives were diecast metal, and the carriages and wagons were generally made of tinplate. This was a very well planned range of electric and clockwork models, successfully consolidating 12 V DC as the standard for OO scale. This led to the adoption of OO as a broadly accepted modelling standard in the UK, whereas much of the rest of the world adopted HO scale. As for their O gauge locomotives, electric Hornby Dublo locomotives ran on a third rail electric system with the track built on a pressed tinplate base.

Both OO and HO use the same track gauge, but their scales are different. Beginning as literally &quot;half O gauge&quot;, the HO models of continental prototypes at 3.5 mm/foot (1:87) scale were workable but Hornby chose to slightly increase the scale to 4 mm/foot for the smaller British prototypes, to provide more internal space for a motor. This has had the effect, remaining to this day, of making their gauge an apparent rather than the true .

The range expanded quickly, but was curtailed from 1940 due to World War II, production being completely suspended in 1942. Production resumed after the war but did not reach full capacity until 1948. Clockwork models were not produced in 00 scale after the war.

In 2008, a special commemorative model of LNER Class A4 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley was produced, in period packaging, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of this introduction.

Like its counterparts Bassett-Lowke and Exley in the UK and Lionel and American Flyer in the US, Hornby thrived in the first half of the 1950s but struggled in the second half of the decade. The company was slow to recognise the threat posed by rival manufacturers (particularly Triang-Rovex) and to realise the potential of plastic. In 1959, far too late, Hornby introduced two-rail track and moulded plastic rolling stock (the Super Detail series), but even then the system was complicated and difficult to use in comparison to its rivals. With the benefit of hindsight, the policy of keeping the faith with its existing three-rail users whilst bringing the two-rail system to the market was a mistake that cost the company dearly. Whilst all the newer plastic-wheeled rolling stock was compatible with either system, the locomotives (and track) most definitely were not, requiring the two parallel productions of practically every locomotive* in the range to be offered in both formats. Meanwhile, the company persisted in producing a range of very old-fashioned 0 gauge models, in 1957 completely retooling much of the range instead of taking the opportunity to discontinue it, indicative of major failings at management level.

(* With the exception of the very first two-rail locomotive, a Southern Region R1 0-6-0 tank engine; the later E3002 AL1 Bo-Bo electric locomotive was ordinarily two-rail only but three-rail ones were made to special order.)

===Tri-ang Hornby: 1964–1972===

In 1964, Lines Bros Ltd., the parent company of rival Tri-ang Railways, purchased Meccano Ltd., and merged Hornby and Tri-ang into &quot;Tri-ang Hornby&quot;. The former Hornby line was discontinued in favour of Tri-ang&#x27;s less costly plastic designs. The Hornby Dublo tooling was sold to G &amp; R Wrenn, which continued to make most of the loco range and &#x27;superdetail&#x27; rolling stock. Remaining stocks of 0 gauge were either scrapped or sold to the local retailer Hattons Model Railways.

===Hornby Railways: 1972–1980===
The Tri-ang group was disbanded in 1971 when Meccano Ltd&#x27;s owner Lines Bros. filed for bankruptcy. The former Tri-ang Hornby was sold to Dunbee-Combex-Marx, becoming &quot;Hornby Railways&quot; in 1972. By 1976 Hornby was facing challenges from Palitoy and Airfix, both of which were producing high quality detailed models. Detail on the models was upgraded to make the product line more attractive to adult hobbyists.

==== Zero 1 ====
A &quot;digital model railway control system&quot; named &quot;Zero 1&quot; was introduced in late 1979. The Zero 1 system enabled the simultaneous control of up to 16 locomotives and up to 99 accessories such as points and signals. 

Zero 1 was based on digital, not analogue, technology. This really was the first digital system and as such was a forerunner to the Märklin Digital which appeared in the mid-1980s and the National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) Digital Command Control (DCC) system, which appeared around 1990 and was standardized internationally in the mid-1990s. 

Although an important milestone, Zero 1 was not a lasting success. The Master Control unit last appeared in the catalog in 1985. The slave controller, the locomotive module, and the accessory module were still available until the late 1980s. The system is still used today by many modellers, highlighted by the demand on such sites like eBay for the items in the secondhand market. The Main Master unit was discontinued in 1986, and finally the last time Loco Modules were listed was in the 1991 catalogue &#x27;Limited supplies of R955 Loco module are available&#x27;. Repairs to Zero 1 units were no longer undertaken by Hornby apparently due to &#x27;Lack of available parts required&#x27;.

Despite being on the market for a short time, Zero 1 had the largest installed base among command control systems in the early 1980s in North America, according to a reader survey done by &quot;Model Railroader&quot; magazine.

==== Rocket ====
As part of the 1980 Rocket 150 celebrations, Hornby released a live steam-powered gauge locomotive, a model of &quot;Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket&quot; A major goal was to make real live steam accessible to an indoor domestic environment. The boiler was considerably smaller than the external diameter, surrounded by a thick insulating jacket to prevent burns. It was fuelled by butane gas, from cigarette lighter refills. To provide more torque from the small cylinders, gearing was adeptly hidden between the cranks and the wheels. The track was of asymmetric moulded plastic units, representing the fishbelly rails of the period. These could be assembled either way round, to give either curved or straight track.

By 1980, the market was extremely tough and Dunbee-Combex-Marx was liquidated, placing Hornby in receivership.

===Hornby Hobbies Limited: 1980–2015===
In 1980, Hornby became &quot;Hornby Hobbies&quot; and in 1981 a management buyout saw the company back on a sound footing. It went public in 1986.

By the early 1990s Hornby again faced competition from newcomers such as Dapol (established 1983) and established foreign manufacturers, including Lima and Bachmann Industries. Manufacturing was moved to Guangdong province in China in 1995, completed by 1999, in a cost-cutting exercise. As part of the process Hornby also bought in some of Dapol&#x27;s products and also some of the old Airfix moulds (which had been bought by Dapol as part of the Mainline range from Palitoy in 1985). Train sets based on Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends and Harry Potter (the &quot;Hogwarts Express&quot;) have been particularly profitable ventures. In September 2003 Hornby released its first steam-powered 00 gauge locomotive, a model of the record-breaking &quot;Mallard&quot;. Several other &quot;Live Steam&quot; locomotives have now been produced.

Since then Hornby has bought Lima, an Italian model railway equipment manufacturer that had previously acquired Jouef, a French manufacturer. Some of the ex-Lima models appear in the main Hornby products list. This range is known as Hornby International. This acquisition also included the Rivarossi line of HO-scale products, also originally from Italy, and the Arnold brand of N-scale products. They also took over the Spanish model railway company Electrotren. Electrotren had been the Spanish importer for Scalextric, sold in Spain as Superslot. The takeover was at the request of the Spanish company and was not due to obvious financial problems. They have remained independent outside of the Hornby International umbrella.

With competition mainly from Bachmann Industries, and to a much lesser extent from minor and generally niche players such as the Danish model railway company Heljan, Dapol, Vi Trains and Peco, Hornby Railways produced a large range of highly detailed British steam and diesel locomotives, such as the BR 9F, LNER Class A4, SR Merchant Navy, Class 60, Class 50, Class 31 and Class 08.

In November 2006, Hornby Hobbies acquired Airfix and Humbrol paints for the sum of £2.6 million.
The parent company, Humbrol, had gone into administration earlier that year after cashflow problems. Airfix fans had been concerned that it could be the end of the brand, but just as the name Hornby was once a tradename of Meccano, Airfix is now a successful tradename of Hornby.

In May 2008, Hornby announced the acquisition of Corgi Classics Limited, one of the world&#x27;s oldest makers of collectable die-cast models of trucks, buses, cars and aeroplanes, from Corgi International Limited for £7.5million.

In 2009, the Hornby Shop and Visitor Centre was in development. Christmas 2009 saw the launch of the new Hornby Shop at Margate in Kent, with the visitor centre still under construction. July 2010 saw the opening of the Hornby Shop And Visitor Centre.

===Financial troubles, PAM takeover===
From 2015, Hornby plc began to announce a series of declining financial results. The major reason behind the decline Hornby declared was twofold, with the decline in the number of collecting customers, (older customers dying and not being replaced by younger ones), and a general lack of interest in modelling as a hobby in light of the digitization and advancement of the internet games industry. After the PLC shares dropped by more than 50% in a year, at the 2016 results, Hornby declared that it planned to cut more than half of the toys it made, after discovering that it generated 90% of its profits from only 50% of its range. In the year to 31 March 2017, revenues fell further to £47.4m from £55.8m, while underlying losses widened to £6.3m from a £5.7m deficit in 2016. The financial declines culminated in July 2017, when the largest shareholder Phoenix Asset Management (PAM) agreed to buy 17.6 million Hornby shares for 32.375p from the second largest – and activist/protagonist shareholder – New Pistoia Income (NPI), which gave PAM a 55.2% holding in the company. Under stock exchange rules, this triggered a mandatory takeover offer of Hornby by PAM, at the NPI strike price of 32.375p, valuing Hornby at £27.4million. As a result of the takeover, the chairman of Hornby resigned from the company in August 2017, followed by the Chief Executive in September 2017.

In October 2017, PAM announced their new management team who would join the company and steer through the turnaround. They were Lyndon Davies, former Mettoy employee and owner of Oxford Diecast. Simon Kohler, ex Hornby marketing manager and Tim Mulhall, also from Oxford Diecast and credited with knowledge of the International market, having been the former importer for Hornby International brands in the UK.

The trio proposed a turnaround plan to reengage with the market, make products which were more appealing to customers, clamp down on rising overheads and recover first sales and then move the company back into profitability. The outcomes were not expected to bear fruit for 3–5 years.

The end of year Annual Report for March 2018 revealed how serious the position was for the company, showing further slumps in revenue (down to £35.7m) and a widening pre-tax loss (up to £7.6m).

The March 2019 end of year report showed progress, having stabilised the business, closed unnecessary offices and returned to their historic home in Margate. Sales grew to £37.8m, losses narrowed to £2.8m

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was one element credited in a sales growth of 30%, which was announced in the 2019/20 half year results which covered a period to March 2020. Half year sales of £21m (up from £15.9m) and the first profit in 8 years.

In August 2021, it was announced that Hornby had acquired the remaining 51% of LCD Enterprises (who owned Oxford Diecast) for £1.3 million. This followed Hornby&#x27;s 49% stake in the company, for which they had acquired in 2017.

In October 2022 Hornby released a range of TT:120 items. Two train sets are being offered, with four series of locomotives and rolling stock available.

==Collector and enthusiasts&#x27; groups==
Pre-1964 Hornby trains have enjoyed a level of adult collector interest since the 1940s. In 1969 the Hornby Railway Collector&#x27;s Association was founded to cater for this and currently enjoys a membership approaching 3000, producing 10 journals a year, as well as other literature. Publications on older Hornby and Meccano products are dominated by those published by New Cavendish Books as &quot;The Hornby Companion Series&quot;, in particular Chris &amp; Julie Graebe&#x27;s &quot;The Hornby Gauge 0 System&quot; and Michael Foster&#x27;s sister volume on Hornby Dublo. Triang-Hornby and later Hornby products are catered for by the &quot;Train Collectors&#x27; Society&quot;.

==Brands==
Hornby owns Humbrol and, through that acquisition, Airfix, and Corgi Toys. It also owns a number of established brands in the model railway market.

===Lima===
Lima was an Italian company that was a popular, affordable supplier of model railway material but market pressures in the mid-1990s led to Lima merging with Rivarossi, Arnold, and Jouef. When these consolidations failed and operations ceased in 2004, Hornby Railways acquired Lima&#x27;s assets. As of mid 2006, a range of these products has been made available under the Hornby International brand, refitted with NEM couplings and sprung buffers and sockets for DCC decoders. Lima also had a popular OO gauge range much like Hornby, which strengthened the case for acquisition.

===Skaledale===
&#x27;Skaledale&#x27; is a range of resin buildings and track accessories produced for 00 gauge railways by Hornby Hobbies Ltd. Production began in 2003 when an initial range of only 6 items were distributed into the market place. The interest and demand proved so positive that the range increased the following year to include new domestic style buildings plus the introduction of station and trackside buildings.

Many of the models are similar to those of &#x27;Lyddle End&#x27; (a range which followed &#x27;Skaledale&#x27;), but these &quot;N&quot; Gauge buildings are produced to a smaller scale of 1:148.

The Skaledale range comprises station buildings, platforms, trackside accessories, shops, houses, churches, monuments and street furniture.

Forbes Outfitters and St. Andrews Church for example, provided the inspiration for their scaled down models, although others are adapted to suit a particular price point or subject. The station and trackside buildings are inspired by actual structures but again in some cases adapted to suit manufacturing constraints. Some of the station pieces were inspired by Goathland railway station.

===Lyddle End===
Lyddle End is the range of N scale model railway buildings for Hornby Railways. The buildings are created from high quality die cast resin and are made to represent the fictional village of Lyddle End, somewhere in England. Most of the buildings are models of GWR style buildings made out of red sandstone.

Hornby created these buildings thanks to the success of their 00 gauge buildings, which they call &quot;Skaledale&quot;. Many of the buildings are the same as their Skaledale equivalent, except in different scales, to save the cost of designing a new model. They are generally released about 6 months to a year behind their 00 counterparts. When Hornby announced their 2010 range, Lyddle End was not mentioned, presumably ended.

=== Warlord Games Limited ===
In July 2023 Hornby acquired a 25% share in Warlord Games, a company that produces historical tabletop wargames.

==In media==
An attempt to build the world&#x27;s longest model railway formed the final episode of &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot;.
May, who had previously identified the train set as his &quot;absolute favourite&quot;, hoped that a train would run successfully along the length of the Tarka Trail, which is a disused long railway line in North Devon.

Hornby was heavily involved, providing the track and the prototype of their OO gauge British Rail Class 395 &quot;Javelin&quot; train. Simon Kohler, marketing manager of Hornby model railways, said that the train which travels at just failed two miles short of Bideford station; but he also told BBC News &quot;Even though the last locomotive gave up the ghost at Instow, we did link the track. In April 2011 on the TV series &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories: Revisited&quot;, James tried again, this time against the Germans. All the trains reached their destinations and the British team won.

In 2019 the mini-series &quot;James May&#x27;s Big Trouble in Model Britain&quot; was broadcast on BBC Four, which the channel described as, &#x27;A year inside Hornby Hobbies – an iconic British toymaker on the brink of collapse.&#x27;

In 2021, a ten-episode series was produced by Rare TV for the Yesterday TV channel called &quot;Hornby: A Model World&quot;, which went behind the scenes at Hornby and also featured models from Airfix, Scalextric and Corgi within various episodes. A second season of 11 episodes was broadcast in 2023.

==One:One Collection==
In 2019 the One:One Collection of real historic engines and rolling stock opened at Hornby&#x27;s former Margate factory. It had been purchased by Jeremy Hosking, with some Hosking-owned rolling stock placed on display.

<text>The 25pdr SP, tracked, Sexton was a Canadian-designed self-propelled artillery vehicle of the Second World War. It was based on Canadian-built derivatives of the American M3 Lee and M4 Sherman tank chassis. Canada had set up to produce the Ram tank using the M3 chassis and Grizzly (a copy of the M4) to complement US medium tank production; when Sherman production in the US expanded and supply was no longer a problem, it was decided in 1943 to switch the Canadian production lines to produce the Sexton to give the British Army a mobile artillery gun using their Ordnance QF 25-pounder gun-howitzer for commonality with towed guns. The Sexton could fire either HE shell or an armour-piercing shell. 
It found use in the Canadian, British, and other British Commonwealth armies, as well as other countries. After the war, a number of Sextons and Grizzlies were sold to Portugal, which used them into the 1980s.

==History==
In order to better provide artillery support in the highly mobile desert warfare of the North African Campaign, the British Army had quickly adapted the Valentine tank into a self-propelled 25-pounder gun: the Bishop. Introduced in 1942, the Bishop proved to have many problems in service. In particular, limited space meant that the turret had little elevation, requiring crews to use natural slopes, embankments or mounds to get the full range out of the gun. 

As a stop-gap, the US-built M7 Priest, with a M101 105 mm howitzer, mounted on a M3 Lee chassis, was soon replacing the Bishop, reaching service in October 1942. In March 1942, the UK ordered 2,500 for 1942 with another 3,000 for 1943. The first M7s were rushed to Egypt for the Second Battle of El Alamein where they played an important part. However, because the US 105 mm gun was not otherwise used by the British military, supplying ammunition to Priest crews was complicated and caused delays.

Simultaneously, two new self-propelled 25-pounder projects were being pursued by the British General Staff. Firstly, in the US, the 25-pounder Howitzer Motor Carriage T51 – a Priest adapted to mount the 25-pounder – was tested from July 1942. Development was delayed by issues including the destruction of the gun mount on the prototype, during the first live-firing trials. 

Secondly, because US resources were increasingly devoted to equipping and upgrading the existing weaponry of US forces, the UK government inquired whether the Canadian government could facilitate rapid development and manufacturing of a self-propelled 25-pdr. The Canadian Department of Munitions and Supply asked the Canadian Army Engineering Design Branch to build such a vehicle. 

A prototype was quickly built on the chassis of a Canadian Ram tank, which was also based on the M3 chassis. The Ram had been sidelined by a decision that Canadian armoured units should standardize around the Sherman and variants using the same chassis. The prototype was completed on 23 June 1942. Following trials in Canada, the Canadian government ordered 124 vehicles in three batches. The prototype was shipped to the United Kingdom in early 1943, where it underwent further trials. In May 1943, it was formally accepted for use by the British Army and given the name &quot;Sexton&quot; (after the religious custodian and following in the tradition of the Bishop and the Deacon self-propelled guns). 
A UK order for 300 Sextons was made in mid-1943, albeit built on the hull of the Grizzly tank (a Canadian-built variant of the M4A1 Sherman). The Ram-based SP gun became known as the Sexton Mark I, while the Grizzly-based variant was the Sexton Mark II. UK orders for the Sexton II eventually totalled 2,026 vehicles.

The Sexton was generally regarded as a successful project, unlike the Ram (which never saw combat in its original form). Between 1943 and 1945, the Montreal Locomotive Works manufactured 2,150 Sextons for the use of both Canadian and British forces. The vehicle entered service in September 1943. In spite of its confused origins, the Sexton was a combination of proven parts and proved to be a successful design that remained in British service until 1956.

==Operational service==
The vehicles were first used in combat in Italy by the British Eighth Army. Later, Sextons took part in the invasion of France and subsequent Battle of Normandy and the campaign in north-western Europe. During the D-day landings, a number of Sextons were ordered to fire from their landing craft as they approached the beaches although the fire did not prove to be very accurate. After the war a number of units were equipped with the Sexton as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).

The following units were equipped with the Sexton at different periods:

*1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, Italy 1944-45, post-war (Sexton withdrawn in 1956)
*2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, Italy 1944-45, post-war (Sexton withdrawn in 1957)
*3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, post-war
*4/22 Field Regiment (South African Irish and Transvaal Horse Artillery), South African Artillery, 6th South African Armoured Division, Italy 1944-45 (January 1944 to August 1944 then replaced by the M7 Priest when the Division transferred to US IV Corps US 5th Army )
*5th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, North West Europe 1944–45; post-war
* 6th Field (Self Propelled) Regiment, Royal Artillery, post-war
* 10th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, post-war
*13th (HAC) Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, North West Europe 1944-45
*86th (East Anglian) (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, North West Europe 1944-45
*90th(City of London) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, North West Europe 1944-45
*98th Field Regiment (Surrey &amp; Sussex Yeomanry Queen Mary&#x27;s), Royal Artillery, North west Europe 1945
*147th (Essex Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, North West Europe 1944-45
*153rd (Leicestershire Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, North West Europe 1944-45

British and Canadian forces used the Sexton for indirect supporting fire, keeping the Sextons back from the front line and used forward observers to direct overwhelming fire onto a target.

The Indian 1st and 2nd Field Artillery Regiments used Sextons after World War II.

==Variants==
*Sexton I: The first 125 vehicles manufactured. Based on the Ram tank hull.
*Sexton II: It featured boxes added to the rear deck to carry batteries and an auxiliary generator to charge them. Based on the Grizzly (M4A1 Sherman) hull.
*Sexton GPO (Gun Position Officer): The 25 pounder was removed and an extra No. 19 Wireless was added along with map tables; this vehicle was used to control battery fire.

==British self-propelled gun naming==
A British self-propelled gun armed with the Ordnance QF 25-pounder in design from 1941 was given the service name &quot;Bishop&quot; as its appearance was said to resemble a bishop&#x27;s mitre. A replacement, the US 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M7 was called &quot;Priest&quot; by the British, as part of its superstructure was said to resemble a priest&#x27;s pulpit. Following this line of names, a 1942 self-propelled QF 6 pounder on armoured truck chassis was named &quot;Deacon&quot;. A post-war self-propelled gun was called Abbot.
