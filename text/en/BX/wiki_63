<text>Negative campaigning is the process of deliberately spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the public image of the described. A colloquial, and somewhat more derogatory, term for the practice is mudslinging.

Deliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described, or by the campaigner&#x27;s dishonest ideas on methods of winning in political, business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival. However, if the mudslinging statements can be proved to be correct, mudslinging takes the moral dimension of an opponent&#x27;s duty serving the greater good by exposing the weakness of the other candidate.

The public image of an entity can be defined as reputation, esteem, respect, acceptance of the entity&#x27;s appearance, values and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and/or a social group, possibly within time limits. As target groups of public and their values differ, so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative; thus, to be successful, negative campaigning has to take into account current values of the group it addresses. The degree of strictness in practicing the group&#x27;s values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration.

== Techniques ==
There are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning. The most standard form of negative campaigning is campaign advertising that serves as an attack on an opponent&#x27;s personality, record, or opinion. There are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning: attack and contrast.

Attack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent. There is no positive content in an attack ad, whether it is about the candidate or the opponent. Attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent, often exploiting people&#x27;s fears to manipulate. Because attack ads have no positive content, they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters’ views of the sponsoring candidate&#x27;s opponent. One of the most famous attack ads was &quot;Daisy Girl&quot; by the campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson that successfully portrayed Republican Barry Goldwater as threatening nuclear war. Common attack ad themes include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. Another relatively common theme is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign.

Unlike attack ads, contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent. The information about the candidate is positive, while the information about the opponent is negative. Contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent, juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent. Because contrast ads must contain positive information, contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads.

Push polls are attacks disguised as telephone polls. They might ask a question like &quot;How would you react if Candidate A was revealed to beat his wife?&quot;, giving the impression that Candidate A might beat his wife. Members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable.

Dirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns. These generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media. This isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money. The material must be substantive enough to attract media interest, however, and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign. Other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent&#x27;s team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves.

Often a campaign will use outside organizations, such as lobby groups, to launch attacks. These can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven. Negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy. For instance, highly partisan ads were placed in the 2004 U.S. presidential election by allegedly independent bodies like MoveOn.org and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.

== Advantages ==
Sponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support mass communication of negative ideas. The Office of National Drug Control Policy uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks. Similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by tobacco companies, or to discourage drunk driving. Those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for, even if it is bad. In other words, if a candidate&#x27;s opponent is a crook or a bad person, then he or she should be able to tell the public about it.

Martin Wattenberg and Craig Brians, of the University of California, Irvine, considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters. They concluded that data used by Stephen Ansolabehere in a 1994 American Political Science Review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed.

A subsequent study done by Ansolabehere and Shanto Iyengar in 1995 corrected some of the previous study&#x27;s flaws. This study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout, particularly for Independent voters. They speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the Independent vote is leaning toward the opponent. In doing so, they insure that the swing voters stay home, leaving the election up to base voters. They also found that negative ads have a greater impact on Democrats than on Republicans. According to them, base Republicans will vote no matter what (and will vote only for a Republican), but Democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a Republican. This, combined with the effect negativity has on Independents, led them to conclude that Republicans benefit more from going negative than Democrats.

Other researchers have found different, more positive outcomes from negative campaigns. Rick Farmer, PhD, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Akron found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign. Researchers at the University of Georgia found the impact of negative ads increases over time, while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads. Research also suggests negative campaigning introduces controversy and raises public awareness through additional news coverage.

Kyle Mattes and David P. Redlawsk in &quot;The Positive Case for Negative Campaigning&quot; show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning may provide informational benefits for voters. Without negativity, voters would not have full information about all of their choices, since no candidate will say anything bad about herself. They argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed.

Most recent research distinguishes between a dichotomous (positive versus negative) and graded conceptualization of negative campaigning. The latter accounts for differences in the strength of negative communication. It argues that positive (i.e. information about parties and candidates) and derogatory (i.e. democratic disaffection) effects of negative campaigning will depend on the strength or intensity of negative campaigning. Similarly, political candidates and parties have been found to adapt the strength of their negative messages during election campaigns in order to preserve the chances for post-electoral collaboration in countries with frequent coalition governments.

== Risks and consequences ==
Some strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process, reducing voter turnout and radicalizing politics. 
In a study done by Gina Garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process, it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization. While positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization, Garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning.

Negative ads can produce serious backlash. A disastrous ad was run by the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the 1993 Canadian federal election, apparently emphasizing Liberal Party of Canada leader Jean Chrétien&#x27;s partial facial paralysis, which was caused by Bell&#x27;s palsy, in a number of unflattering photos, with the subtext of criticizing his platforms. Chrétien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public&#x27;s sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party&#x27;s subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing Progressive Conservatives to two seats, along with losing official party status.

A similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party in the 2006 federal election for running an attack ad that suggested that Conservative leader Stephen Harper would use Canadian soldiers to patrol Canadian cities, and impose some kind of martial law. The ad was only available from the Liberal Party&#x27;s web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television; nevertheless, it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity, in particular the sentence &quot;we&#x27;re not making this up; we&#x27;re not allowed to make this stuff up&quot;. Liberal MP Keith Martin expressed his disapproval of &quot;whoever the idiot who approved that ad was,&quot; shortly before Liberal leader Paul Martin (no relation) stated that he had personally approved them. The effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party&#x27;s other attack ads. It offended many Canadians, particularly those in the military, some of whom were fighting in Afghanistan at the time. (See 2006 Canadian federal election)

In the 2008 US Senate race in North Carolina, Republican incumbent Elizabeth Dole attempted an attack ad on Democratic challenger Kay Hagan, who had taken a small lead in polls, by tying her to atheists. Dole&#x27;s campaign released an ad questioning Hagan&#x27;s religion and it included a voice saying &quot;There is no God!&quot; over a picture of Kay Hagan&#x27;s face. The voice was not Hagan&#x27;s but it is believed the ad implied that it was. Initially, it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the American south, but the ad produced a backlash across the state and Hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a Sunday school teacher and was a religious person. Hagan also claimed Dole was trying to change the subject from the economy (the ad appeared during the Great Recession). Hagan&#x27;s lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine-point margin.

Because of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner, candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks. This pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be &quot;going negative,&quot; with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.

While some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages, some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches.

Research published in the Journal of Advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically, but the mind remembers negative messages. The findings are based on research conducted by James Angelini, professor of communication at the University of Delaware, in collaboration with Samuel Bradley, assistant professor of advertising at Texas Tech University, and Sungkyoung Lee of Indiana University, which used ads that aired during the 2000 presidential election. During the study, the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of 30-second ads from both the George W. Bush and Al Gore campaigns. The electrodes picked up on the &quot;startle response,&quot; the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes, spiders and other threats. Compared to positive or neutral messages, negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away.

== Causes ==
Studies have shown a variety of different negativity&#x27;s predictors. Some of the negativity&#x27;s drivers stated are: The attacker&#x27;s personality traits (Big Five, Dark Triad, Populism), the media environment, and election-related factors (competitiveness, a candidate&#x27;s rank in polls, type of election, party system).

== Notable examples ==

===United States===
In United States politics, negative campaigning has been called &quot;as American as Mississippi mud&quot; and &quot;as American as apple pie&quot;. Some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues, mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest. Lee Atwater, best known for being an advisor to presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.
* 1828: The Coffin Handbills used by supporters of John Quincy Adams against Andrew Jackson in the 1828 presidential campaign. 
* 1934: Unethical campaign tactics were used against Upton Sinclair in the California gubernatorial election.
* 1936: The first radio advertising using negative campaigning came from the Republican Party in 1936.
* 1964: The Daisy ad used by Lyndon Johnson against Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election
* 2008: Hillary Clinton&#x27;s &quot;3 a.m. phone call&quot; ad questioning the crisis management abilities of her opponent, Barack Obama.
* 2008: Elizabeth Dole&#x27;s ad against Democratic challenger Kay Hagan in her 2008 Senate re-election campaign, where Hagan was said to be &quot;Godless&quot;, as an attack to the lack of religious piety of her opponent. The ad backfired, as it sharply reduced support for Dole. Dole was defeated by Hagan in the election.
* 2012–present: Nicknames used by Donald Trump before, during, and after his presidency.
* 2014: Justin Amash was smeared as &quot;Al-Qaeda&#x27;s best friend in Congress&quot; by his primary opponent Brian Ellis.

===Elsewhere===
* Argentina: In the 2023 Argentine general election, the governing Unión por la Patria launched various fearmongering ads during one of the worst economic crisis of the history of the nation, in which they claimed economic crisis and human rights would worsen if they&#x27;re not voted.
* New Zealand: In the 1975 New Zealand general election, the opposing National Party launched the infamous &quot;Dancing Cossacks&quot; television advertisement. Animated by Hanna Barbera, the attack advert claimed the incumbent Labour Party&#x27;s recently introduced compulsory superannuation scheme could eventually lead to Soviet-style communism.
* Canada: In the 1993 Canadian federal election, the Progressive Conservative Party launched attack ads that were widely seen to be mocking opposing candidate Jean Chrétien&#x27;s facial deformity. See: 1993 Chrétien attack ad
* United Kingdom: During the run up to the 1997 general election, the Conservative Party ran a campaign that stated that the Labour Party was dangerous and used posters of Labour leader Tony Blair with &quot;demon eyes&quot; on them titled &quot;New Labour, New Danger&quot; (in reference to the New Labour slogan). The campaign failed as Labour won a landslide victory, ending 18 years of Conservative government.
* Mexico: in the 2006 presidential election, Felipe Calderón, president from 2006 to 2012, launched TV ads that stated his opponent, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was &quot;a danger to Mexico&quot;. To this day, López Obrador continues blaming the negative campaign for his defeat and saying that it was part of a conspiracy that the Mexican business elite planned against him.
* Canada: In the 2008 Canadian federal election, the Conservative Party released an ad featuring Opposition Leader Stéphane Dion being defecated on by an animated puffin. Harper later apologized for the ad.
* In the Crewe and Nantwich By-election in 2008, The Labour Party ran a personal class-based campaign against the Conservative candidate Edward Timpson, calling him &quot;the Tarporley Toff&quot;, &quot;Lord Snooty&quot;, &quot;Tory Boy Timpson&quot;. Labour supporters donned top hats to mock Timpson, whose family own a national shoe repair and key-cutting business. The campaign was very poorly received and was condemned as negative and xenophobic by Conservative leader David Cameron.
* Serbia: In the 2018 Belgrade City Assembly election, the ruling party SNS launched a negative campaign against two candidates, Aleksandar Šapić and Dragan Đilas. In a TV political ad they were portrayed as tycoons and criminals who are too busy protesting against Aleksandar Vučić and meeting other criminals than attending meetings. The advertisement caught the attention of REM, which resulted in a suspend of the advertisement.
* Philippines: then-vice presidential candidate Antonio Fuentes Trillanes IV aired a negative ad against then-presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte in the tail end of the 2016 Philippine general election highlighting his public obscenity.
* Poland: Chairman of the Polish public broadcaster TVP, Jacek Kurski aired a negative claim against then-presidential candidate Donald Tusk during 2005 Polish presidential election falsely claiming that his grandfather had briefly fought in Hitler&#x27;s army.

<doc id="677522" wikidata="Q846315" url="?curid=677522" title="Wild Dances">
<text>&quot;Wild Dances&quot; is a song composed and recorded by Ukrainian singer-songwriter Ruslana, with lyrics by herself, Oleksandr Ksenofontov, Jamie Maher, Michael Fayne, and Sherena Dugani. It in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, held in Istanbul, resulting in the country&#x27;s first win at the contest.

== Background ==
=== Conception ===
&quot;Wild Dances&quot; was composed and recorded by Ruslana, with lyrics by herself, Oleksandr Ksenofontov, Jamie Maher, Michael Fayne, and Sherena Dugani. The work on the song lasted for about three months. Editing and sound engineering was done by Ruslana together with specialists from Kyiv, London, and New York City. The recording was done together with a guitarist from Cool Before, and an ex-trumpet player from Zdob și Zdub. The Ukrainian and English lyrics of the song, as well as the chorus and melody, underwent significant changes since the initial stage. She released a version only in Ukrainian called &quot;Dyki tantsi&quot; () in Ukraine and Russia.

=== Selection ===
On 23 January 2004, the National Television Company of Ukraine (NTU) announced that it had internally selected Ruslana as its performer for the of the Eurovision Song Contest. On 28 January 2004, NTU announced that &quot;Wild Dances&quot; would be the for Eurovision.

=== Music video ===
The official music video was filmed in the abandoned building of the Ice Palace, which was at once renamed &quot;The Iceberg Palace&quot; by the members of Ruslana&#x27;s crew because no heating equipment brought with Ruslana could heat the cold air of the huge building to a comfortable level. The building was &#x27;decorated&#x27; with sheer concrete and windows without glass. Despite the script of the video-clip, which provided for constant burning fire in large barrels, torches on the stage, wireworks and even a real military flame thrower, only the &quot;Wild Dances&quot; could help people to ultimately warm up. It was first aired on 6 May 2004 on MTV Russia in the &quot;12 Angry Viewers&quot; show, but was booed by the audience.

=== Eurovision ===
On 12 May 2004, the semi-final for the Eurovision Song Contest was held at the Abdi İpekçi Arena in Istanbul hosted by the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), and broadcast live throughout the continent. As Ukraine had not finished in the top 10 at the , the song had to compete in the semi-final. Ruslana performed &quot;Wild Dances&quot; eleventh on the night, following &#x27;s &quot;Shake It&quot; by Sakis Rouvas and preceding &#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Happened to Your Love&quot; by Linas and Simona. The song qualified for the grand final. After the grand final it was revealed that it had received in the semi-final 256 points, placing second in a field of twenty-two.

Mistakenly, the song title was captioned on screen at the contest as being &quot;Wild Dance&quot;, without the S, both in semi final and grand final.

On 14 May 2004, the grand final for the Eurovision Song Contest was held. Ruslana performed again &quot;Wild Dances&quot; tenth on the night, following &#x27;s &quot;The Image of You&quot; by Anjeza Shahini and preceding &#x27;s &quot;You Are the Only One&quot; by Ivan Mikulić. Her performance is memorable for an energetic performance, which Ruslana gave in a leather outfit, inspired by &quot;&quot; and the ethnic tradition of Ukraine.

At the close of voting of the grand final, it had received 280 points, winning the contest. It was the first victory for Ukraine. With a mixture of English and Ukrainian lyrics, &quot;Wild Dances&quot; was also the first Eurovision-winning song to be sung at least partly in a language other than English since the rule-change of 1999, when countries were allowed to sing in a language of their choosing, rather than one of their official languages. With this win, Ukraine became the third post-Soviet country to win the contest, after and .

=== Aftermath ===
The single was included on the official compilation album called &quot;The Very Best of Eurovision&quot; celebrating the 60th anniversary of the contest.

As the winning broadcaster, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) gave NTU the responsibility to host the of the Eurovision Song Contest. The grand final held on 21 May 2005, opened with Ruslana performing a medley of &quot;Wild Dances&quot; and &quot;Heart on Fire&quot; accompanied by the Zhyttia ballet and the Ukrainian drums ensemble ARS Nova. She also performed her latest single &quot;The Same Star&quot; in the interval act and presented the trophy to the winner.

<text>Towarzystwo Sportowe Wisła Kraków [[Spółka Akcyjna]], commonly referred to as Wisła Kraków (), is a Polish professional football club based in Kraków. They currently compete in the I liga, the second level of Polish football league system, following relegation from the 2021–22 Ekstraklasa season. It ranks fourth in the number of national titles won (13), behind Górnik Zabrze, Ruch Chorzów (both on 14), and Legia Warsaw (15), and second in all-time victories. Wisła was founded in 1906 under the name TS Wisła (Polish: Towarzystwo Sportowe Wisła). The team plays its home matches at Henryk Reyman Stadium.

The club&#x27;s coat of arms is a white star on a red background crossed by a blue ribbon.

Wisła Kraków was one of the most successful Polish football clubs of 2000s, winning eight league championships since 1999. Along with league titles, Wisła also won the Polish Cup on five occasions, including the first-ever edition in 1926, and are the current cup holders. Wisła also enjoyed some success in European competitions in the 1970s, reaching the quarter-finals in the 1978–79 European Cup.

==History==

Wisła Kraków was founded in 1906 when students of the Second Practical School in Kraków, inspired by their professor Tadeusz Łopuszański, formed a football club.

In this first, historic season of the League, the fight for the championship was decided between two teams: Wisła Kraków and 1. FC Kattowitz. This rivalry was treated very seriously, not only by the two sides involved, but also by the whole nation. 1. FC was regarded as the team supported by the German minority, while Wisła, at the end of this historic season, represented ambitions of all Poles.
Some time in the fall of 1927 in Katowice, an ill-fated game between 1.FC and Wisła took place. Stakes were very high – the winner would become the Champion. Kraków&#x27;s side won 2–0 and became the Champion. 1.FC finished second, third was Warta Poznań.

During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), the club operated secretly. Co-founder Franciszek Brożek and pre-war player Adam Obrubański were among Poles murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940.

In 1949, the club was renamed to Gwardia-Wisła Kraków. In 1955 the club returned to its original name, TS Wisła. In 1967, the club was once again renamed, to GTS Wisła, a name which held until 1990 when the club reverted to its original name, TS Wisła. In the late 1990s, the football section of the club was incorporated and was renamed Wisła Kraków SSA.

The club has had its ups and downs, winning national championships and earning European qualification. It was also relegated to the second division on three occasions. Since the football section has been bought by Tele-Fonika Kable S.A. in 1998, the team has been far and away the most successful club in Poland, winning seven national championships and finishing in second place three times, totalling ten top two finishes in 12 years.

At international level, Wisła has competed in all three of the European competitions. The club&#x27;s greatest success came in the 1978–79 season, when Wisła was able to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup, eventually to be knocked out by Malmö FF 3–5 on aggregate. Most recently, Wisła narrowly missed out on a chance to compete in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League group stage, being defeated 4–5 by Panathinaikos after extra time.

Wisła also twice reached the second round of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1967–68 and 1984–85, falling 0–5 and 2–3 by Hamburger SV and Fortuna Sittard, respectively. The &quot;White Star&quot; has competed in the UEFA Cup ten times.

On 15 May 2022, Wisła was relegated to the I liga for the first time since 1996, after losing 4–2 against Radomiak Radom.

On 2 May 2024, they won their fifth Polish Cup title after defeating Pogoń Szczecin 1–2 in extra time, becoming the fifth second division team to win this competition, and the first since Ruch Chorzów in 1996. The &quot;White Star&quot; itself finished the 2023–24 season ranked 10th in the second tier.

==Stadium==

Henryk Reyman Stadium is located at 22 Reymonta Street in Kraków. The stadium was originally built in 1953 and currently has a capacity of 33,326. The stadium was renovated in 2010, being upgraded to UEFA elite standards. The Wisła Stadium was also chosen as a reserve venue for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, jointly held in Poland and Ukraine. The record attendance of 45,000 at Wisła Stadium came on 29 September 1976 when Wisła defeated Celtic 2–0. The venue has been a fortress for Wisła, where the team is especially difficult to defeat. Wisła holds the all-time Polish football record for consecutive league home games without a loss. The streak began following a loss on 16 September 2001 to KSZO Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, and ended more than five years later on 11 November 2006, when GKS Bełchatów defeated Wisła 4–2. The number of matches without a loss was then settled at 73, overcoming the former Polish record of 48 which belonged to Legia Warsaw. During the 2008–09 season, Wisła lost points at home only twice, drawing with ŁKS Łódź and being defeated by Lech Poznań.
==Supporters and rivalries==

===Fan friendlies===
Wisła fans formerly had long friendships relations with Lechia Gdańsk and Śląsk Wrocław, known as the &quot;Three Kings of Great Cities&quot; alliance until 2016, when their alliance fell apart. They formed a new group with Ruch Chorzów and Widzew Łódź (and by extension Elana Toruń, Slovan Bratislava and KKS Kalisz), which divided Wisła fans.

The fans have an amicable relationship with Polonia Przemyśl. Although Garbarnia Kraków, Puszcza Niepołomice and Kmita Zabierzów have no organised fan movements they are known to have local Wisła fans attend their games. Kmita was founded initially as Wisła Zabierzów as a local branch of the Wisła sports club.

The club also has close relations with Italian side Lazio since their Rome derby match in 2016, as well private contacts with CSKA Moscow and VfL Bochum.

The fans formerly held relations with Unia Tarnów, Jagiellonia Białystok, Siarka Tarnobrzeg, Resovia Rzeszów and Zagłębie Wałbrzych.

===Rivalries===

====With Cracovia====
The term &quot;Holy War&quot; refers to the intense rivalry between the two Kraków-based teams; Wisła and KS Cracovia. In 1906, the establishment of the two first Polish football clubs, Cracovia and Wisła, created a rivalry that now dates back more than 100 years. The term &quot;Holy War&quot; was first used to describe the rivalry of Kraków&#x27;s Jewish teams, Makkabi and Jutrzenka. A Jutrzenka defender, Ludwik Gintel, who later joined the Cracovia side referred to the derby match against Wisła as the &quot;Holy War&quot;. The phrase was incorporated into a song and has since been popular amongst both Wisła and Cracovia fans.

The first recorded Kraków Derby was contested on 20 September 1908, a 1–1 draw. A historic derby match between Cracovia and Wisła occurred on 8 May 1913. It was the first time Polish teams played a championship game officially sanctioned by FIFA; Cracovia won 2–1. The most famous derby took place in 1948 when after the first post-war season, both Cracovia and Wisła accumulated an even number of points and the championship had to be decided by an additional game played at a neutral venue. On 5 December 1948, Cracovia defeated Wisła 3–1 and was crowned national champions. As of May 2011, the Kraków derby game between Wisła and Cracovia has been contested 183 times, with Wisła winning 82 times, tying 42 times and Cracovia winning 59 times.

====With Legia Warsaw====

The match contested between Wisła Kraków and Legia Warsaw, dubbed &quot;The Derby of Poland&quot;, is commonly recognized as one of the greatest rivalries in Polish club football. Historically the two sides have been the most successful clubs in Poland, both in the top two in the all-time table. The rivalry between two of Poland&#x27;s premier cities of Kraków and Warsaw sparks the rivalry even more. The regional differences of Kraków (south) and Warsaw (north), and the fact that Kraków used to be the capital of Poland before Warsaw (in the years 1038–1079 and 1138–1596) and the full official name of Kraków is Stołeczne Królewskie Miasto Kraków, or &quot;Royal Capital City of Kraków&quot; in English, also add a greater meaning to the match.

====With Hutnik Kraków====
The other Kraków derby is contested against Hutnik, historically the third team in Kraków representing Nowa Huta. Owing to Hutnik&#x27;s lack of recent sporting success, the rivalry is mostly off-pitch and with Wisla&#x27;s reserve team or in other sports sections of both clubs.

====Other rivalries====
Other rivalries are with Lech Poznań, Arka Gdynia and Tarnovia Tarnów, an extension of the fierce rivalry with Cracovia as all three maintain good friendships with them.

Fans of Zagłębie Sosnowiec, Korona Kielce, GKS Katowice, and Polonia Warsaw are also inter-regional fierce rivals.

<text>James Maurice Gavin (22 March 1907 – 23 February 1990), sometimes called &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jim&quot; and &quot;the jumping general&quot;, was a senior United States Army officer, with the rank of lieutenant general, who was the third Commanding General (CG) of the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II. During the war, he was often referred to as &quot;The Jumping General&quot; because of his practice of taking part in combat jumps with the paratroopers under his command; he was the only American general officer to make four combat jumps in the war.

Gavin was the youngest major general to command an American division in World War II, being only 37 upon promotion, and the youngest lieutenant general after the war, in March 1955. He was awarded two Distinguished Service Crosses and several other decorations for his service in the war. During combat, he was known for his habit of carrying an M1 rifle, typically carried by enlisted U.S. infantry soldiers, instead of the M1 carbine, which officers customarily carried.

Gavin also worked against segregation in the U.S. Army, which gained him some notability. After the war, Gavin served as United States Ambassador to France from 1961 to 1962.

==Early life==
Gavin was born in Brooklyn, New York, on 22 March 1907. His precise ancestry is unclear. His mother may have been an Irish immigrant, Katherine Ryan, and his father James Nally (also of Irish heritage), although official documentation lists Thomas Ryan as his father; possibly in order to make the birth legitimate. The birth certificate lists his name as James Nally Ryan, although Nally was crossed out. When he was about two years old, he was placed in the Convent of Mercy orphanage in Brooklyn, where he remained until he was adopted in 1909 by Martin and Mary Gavin from Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, and given the name James Maurice Gavin.

Gavin took his first job as a newspaper delivery boy at the age of 10. By the age of 11, he had two routes and was an agent for three out-of-town papers. During this time, he enjoyed following articles about World War I. In the eighth grade, he moved on from the paper job and started working at a barbershop. There he listened to the stories of the old miners. This led him to realize he did not want to be a miner. In school, he learned about the Civil War. From that point on, he decided to study everything he could about the subject. He was amazed at what he discovered and decided if he wanted to learn this &quot;magic&quot; of controlling thousands of troops, from miles away, he would have to continue his education at the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York.

His adoptive father was a hard-working coal miner, but the family still had trouble making ends meet. Gavin quit school after eighth grade and became a full-time clerk at a shoe store for $12.50 a week. His next stint was as a manager for Jewel Oil Company. A combination of restlessness and limited future opportunities in his hometown caused Gavin to run away from home. In March 1924, on his 17th birthday, he took the night train to New York. The first thing he did upon arriving was to send a telegram to his parents saying everything was all right to prevent them from reporting him missing to the police. After that, he started looking for a job.

==Military career==
===Enlistment and West Point===
At the end of March 1924, aged just 17, Gavin spoke to a sergeant in the United States Army. Since he was under 18, he needed parental consent to enlist. Knowing that his adoptive parents would not consent, Gavin told the recruiter he was an orphan. The recruiter took him and a few other underage boys, who were orphans, to a lawyer who declared himself their guardian and signed the parental consent paperwork. On 1 April 1924, Gavin was sworn into the U.S. Army. He later wrote about this period:

He was first stationed in Panama. His basic training was performed on the job in his unit, the U.S. Coast Artillery at Fort Sherman. He served as a crewmember of a 155 mm gun, under the command of Sergeant McCarthy, who described him as &quot;fine&quot;. Another person he looked up to was his first sergeant, an American Indian named &quot;Chief&quot; Williams.

Gavin spent his spare time reading books from the library, notably &quot;Great Captains&quot; and a biography of Hannibal. He had been forced to quit school in seventh grade in order to help support his family, and acutely felt his lack of education. In addition, he made excursions in the region, trying to satisfy his boundless curiosity about everything. First Sergeant Williams recognized Gavin&#x27;s potential and made him his assistant; Gavin was promoted to corporal six months later.

He wished to advance in the army, and on Williams&#x27;s advice, applied to a local army school, from which the best graduates got the chance to attend the USMA at West Point. Gavin passed the physical examinations and was assigned with a dozen other men to a school in Corozal, which was a small army depot in the Canal Zone. He started school on 1 September 1924. In order to prepare for the entrance exams into West Point, Gavin was tutored by another mentor, Lieutenant Percy Black, from 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning until noon on algebra, geometry, English, and history. He passed the exams and was allowed to apply to West Point. He wrote, &quot;I have always been grateful to Lieutenant Black for his insistence and have felt that this was what enabled me to pass.&quot;

Gavin arrived at West Point in the summer of 1925, three months after his 18th birthday and 14 months after enlistment. On the application forms, he indicated his age as 21 (instead of 18) to hide the fact that he was not old enough to join the army when he did. Since Gavin missed the basic education which was needed to understand the lessons, he rose at 4:30 every morning and read his books in the bathroom, the only place with enough light to read. After four years of hard work, he graduated in June 1929, 185th out of a class of 299. In the 1929 edition of the West Point yearbook, &quot;Howitzer&quot;, he was mentioned as a boxer and as the cadet who had already been a soldier. After his graduation and his commissioning as a second lieutenant, he married Irma Baulsir on 5 September 1929.

===Various postings===
Gavin was posted to Camp Harry J. Jones near Douglas, Arizona, on the U.S.–Mexican border. This camp housed the 25th Infantry Regiment (one of the entirely African-American Buffalo Soldier regiments). He stayed in this posting for three years.

Afterward, Gavin attended the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. This school was managed by Colonel George C. Marshall, who had brought Joseph Stilwell with him to lead the Tactics department. Marshall and Stillwell, both of whom were distinguished veterans of World War I, taught their students not to rely on lengthy written orders, but rather to give rough guidelines for the commanders in the field to execute as they saw fit, and to let the field commanders do the actual tactical thinking; this was contrary to all other education in the U.S. Army thus far. Of Stilwell and his methods, Gavin wrote, &quot;He was a superb officer in that position [head of tactics], hard and tough worker, and he demanded much, always insisting that anything you ask the troops to do, you must be able to do yourself.&quot;

The time spent at Fort Benning was a happy time for Gavin, but his marriage with Irma Baulsir was not going well. She had moved with him to Fort Benning, and lived in a town nearby. On 23 December 1932, they drove to Baulsir&#x27;s parents in Washington, D.C., to celebrate Christmas together. Irma decided she was happier there and remained with her parents. In February 1933, Irma became pregnant. Their daughter, Gavin&#x27;s first child, Barbara, was born while Gavin was away from Fort Sill on a hunting trip. &quot;She was very unhappy with me, as was her mother&quot;, Gavin later wrote. Irma remained in Washington during most of their marriage, which ended in divorce upon his return from the war.

In 1933, Gavin, who had no desire to become an instructor for new recruits, was posted to the 28th and 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, under the command of General Lesley J. McNair. He spent most of his free time in, as he called it, the &quot;excellent library&quot; of this fort, while the other soldiers spent most of their time partying, shooting, and playing polo. One author in particular impressed Gavin: J. F. C. Fuller. Gavin said about him: &quot;[He] saw clearly the implications of machines, weapons, gasoline, oil, tanks, and airplanes. I read with avidity all of his writings.&quot;

In 1936, Gavin was posted to the Philippines. While there, he became very concerned about the US&#x27;s ability to counter possible Japanese plans for expansion. The 20,000 soldiers stationed there were badly equipped. In the book &quot;Paratrooper: The Life of Gen. James M. Gavin&quot;, he is quoted as saying, &quot;Our weapons and equipment were no better than those used in World War I&quot;. After a year and a half in the Philippines, he returned to Washington with his family and served with the 3rd Infantry Division in the Vancouver Barracks. Gavin was promoted to captain and held his first command position as commanding officer of K Company of the 7th Infantry Regiment.

While stationed at Fort Ord, California, he received an injury to his right eye during a sports match. Gavin feared that this would end his military career, and he visited a physician in Monterey, California. The physician diagnosed a retinal detachment and recommended an eye patch for 90 days. Gavin decided to rely on his eye healing by itself to hide the injury.

===West Point again===
Gavin was ordered back to West Point, to work in the Tactics faculty there.

===World War II===

====Constructing an airborne army====

Gavin began training at the new Parachute School at Fort Benning in August 1941. After graduating in August, he served in an experimental unit. His first command was as a captain and the commanding officer of C Company of the newly established 503rd Parachute Infantry Battalion.

Gavin&#x27;s friends William T. Ryder, commander of airborne training, and William P. Yarborough, communications officer of the Provisional Airborne Group, convinced Colonel William C. Lee to let Gavin develop the tactics and basic rules of airborne combat. Lee followed up on this recommendation and made Gavin his operations and training officer (S-3). On 16 October 1941, Gavin was promoted to major.

One of Gavin&#x27;s first priorities was determining how airborne troops could be used most effectively. His first action was writing &quot;FM 31-30: Tactics and Technique of Air-Borne Troops.&quot; He used information about Soviet and German experiences with paratroopers and glider troops and also used his own experience in tactics and warfare. The manual contained information about tactics, but also about the organization of the paratroopers, what kind of operations they could execute, and what they would need to execute their task effectively. Later, when Gavin was asked what made his career take off so fast, he would answer, &quot;I wrote the book&quot;.

In February 1942, shortly after the United States entered World War II, Gavin took a condensed course at the US Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which qualified him to serve on the staff of a division. He returned to the Provisional Airborne Group and was tasked with building up an airborne division. In the spring of 1942, Gavin and Lee went to Army Headquarters in Washington, D.C., to discuss the order of battle for the first US airborne division. The 82nd Infantry Division, then stationed at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, and commanded by Major General Omar Bradley, was selected to be converted into the first American airborne division and subsequently became the 82nd Airborne Division. Command of the 82nd went to Major General Matthew Ridgway. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair&#x27;s influence led to the division&#x27;s initial composition of two glider infantry regiments and one parachute infantry regiment, with an organic parachute and glider artillery and other support units.

In August 1942, Gavin became the commanding officer of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) at Fort Benning which had been activated shortly before on 6 July. He was, aged just 35, promoted to colonel shortly thereafter. Gavin built this regiment from the ground up. He led his troops on long marches and realistic training sessions, creating the training missions himself and leading the marches personally. He also placed great value on having his officers &quot;the first out of the airplane door and the last in the chow line&quot;. This practice has continued to and with present-day US airborne units. After months of training, Gavin had the regiment tested one last time:

As we neared our time to leave, on the way to war, I had an exercise that required them to leave our barracks area at 7:00 P.M. and march all night to an area near the town of Cottonwood, Alabama, a march about 23 miles. There we maneuvered all day and in effect, we seized and held an airhead. We broke up the exercise at about 8:00 P.M. and started the troopers back by another route through dense pine forest, by way of backwoods roads. About 11:00 P.M., we went into bivouac. After about one hour&#x27;s sleep, the troopers were awakened to resume the march. In 36 hours the regiment had marched well over 50 miles, maneuvered and seized an airhead, and defended it from counterattack while carrying full combat loads and living off reserve rations.

====Preparations for combat====
In February 1943, the 82nd Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway and consisting of the 325th and 326th Glider Infantry Regiments and the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, along with various units in support, was selected to participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. Not enough gliders were available to have both glider regiments take part in the landings, however, so the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment was relieved from assignment to the 82nd and replaced by Gavin&#x27;s 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, which arrived at Fort Bragg on 12 February.

Gavin arranged a last regimental-sized jump for training and demonstration purposes before the division was shipped to North Africa. On 10 April 1943, Ridgway explained what their next mission would be: Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Gavin&#x27;s regiment would be the first ever in the history of the United States Army to make a regimental-sized airborne landing. He declared, &quot;It is exciting and stimulating that the first regimental parachute operation in the history of our army is to be taken by the 505. It is going to be very tough to do well but if we fail it will not be through lack of effort. I know the regiment will fight to the last man. They will fight as American troops have never fought before.&quot; On 29 April 1943, Gavin left the harbor of New York on board the SS &quot;Monterey&quot;, arriving in Casablanca on 10 May 1943. Lieutenant General George Patton, the U.S. Seventh Army commander, suggested performing the invasion at night, but Ridgway and Gavin disagreed because they had not practiced night jumps. After mounting casualties during practice jumps because of the troopers landing on the hard and rocky ground of the Moroccan desert, Gavin canceled all practice jumps until the invasion.

The regiment was transported to Kairouan in Tunisia, and on 9 July at 10:00 am they entered the planes that would take them to Sicily. Their mission was to land 24 hours before the planned day/time of major combat initiation (&quot;D-Day&quot;) to the north and east of Gela and take and hold the surrounding area to split the German line of supply and disrupt their communications.

====Operation Husky====

A soldier informed Gavin that the windspeed at the landing site was 56 km/h (about 34 miles per hour). During the planning phase, 24 km/h (about 14.5 miles per hour) had been assumed. After one hour of flying, the plane crew could see the bombardment of the invasion beaches. Gavin ordered his men to prepare for the jump, and a few minutes later was the first paratrooper to jump from the plane. Due to the higher-than-expected windspeed, he sprained his ankle while landing. After assembling a group of 20 men, his S-3, Major Benjamin H. Vandervoort, and his S-1, Captain Ireland, he realized that they had drifted off course and were miles from the intended landing areas. He could see signs of combat twenty miles onward; he gathered his men and headed towards the combat zone.

With a small band of between eight and twenty paratroopers of the 505th, Gavin began to march toward the sound of the guns. &quot;He had no idea where his regiment was and only a vague idea as to exactly where he was. We walked all night,&quot; said Major Vandervoort. The paratroopers did not pose a real threat as a fighting force, but their guerrilla tactics were nevertheless very effective. They aggressively took on enemy forces, leaving the impression of a much larger force. At one point on the morning of July 10, Gavin&#x27;s tiny band encountered a 35-man Italian anti-paratroop patrol. An intense firefight ensued, and the Italians were driven back. Several paratroopers were wounded before Gavin and his men were able to gradually disengage. Gavin was the last man to withdraw. &quot;We were sweaty, tired, and distressed at having to leave [our] wounded behind,&quot; said Vandervoort. &quot;The colonel looked over his paltry six-man command and said, &#x27;This is a hell of a place for a regimental commander to be.&#x27;&quot;

At about 8:30 a.m. on 11 July, as Gavin was headed west along Route 115 in the direction of Gela, he began rounding up scattered groups of 505th paratroopers and infantrymen of the 45th Infantry Division and successfully attacked a ridge that overlooked a road junction at the east end of the Acate Valley. It was called Biazzo Ridge. Gavin established hasty defenses on the ridge, overlooking the road junction, Ponte Dirillo, and the Acate River valley. Although he had no tanks or artillery to support him, he immediately appreciated the importance of holding the ridge as the only Allied force between the Germans and their unhindered exploitation of the exposed left flank of the 45th Division and the thinly held right flank of the 1st Infantry Division. Against Gavin, that day was the entire eastern task force of the Hermann Göring Division: at least 700 infantry, an armored artillery battalion, and a company of Tiger tanks.

The German objective was nothing less than counterattacking and throwing the 1st and 45th Divisions back into the sea. Although the attacks of July 10 had failed, those launched the next day posed a dire threat to the still tenuous 45th Division beachhead. For some inexplicable reason, the Germans failed to act aggressively against Gavin&#x27;s outgunned and outmatched force. Even so, that afternoon, a panzer force attacked Biazzo Ridge. Gavin made it clear to his men, &quot;We&#x27;re staying on this goddamned ridge – no matter what happens.&quot;

The defenders of Biazzo Ridge managed to capture two 75mm pack howitzers, which they turned into direct-fire weapons to defend the ridge. One managed to knock out one of the attacking Tiger tanks. By early evening, the situation had turned grim when six American M4 Sherman tanks suddenly appeared, eliciting cheers from the weary paratroopers, who had been joined by others, including some airborne engineers, infantry, clerks, cooks, and truck drivers. With this scratch force and the Shermans, Gavin counterattacked and in so doing deterred the Germans from pressing their considerable advantage. The battle ended with the Americans still in control of Biazzo Ridge. For his feats of valor that day, Colonel Gavin was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

On 9 December 1943, Gavin was promoted to brigadier general and became the assistant division commander of the 82nd Airborne Division. Being only 36 years old at the time, he was one of the youngest Army officers to become a general in World War II. The 82nd Airborne moved to England during the early months of 1944.

====D-Day and Mission Boston====
Gavin was part of Mission Boston on D-Day. This was a parachute combat assault conducted at night by the US 82nd Airborne Division on June 6, 1944, as part of the American airborne landings in Normandy. The intended objective was to secure an area of roughly on either side of the Merderet River. They were to capture the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, a crucial communications crossroad behind Utah Beach, and to block the approaches into the area from the west and southwest. They were to seize causeways and bridges over the Merderet at La Fière and Chef-du-Pont, destroy the highway bridge over the Douve River at Pont l&#x27;Abbé (now Étienville), and secure the area west of Sainte-Mère-Église to establish a defensive line between Gourbesville and Renouf. Gavin was to describe the operation as having two interrelated challenges – it had to be &#x27;planned and staged with one eye on deception and one on the assault&#x27;.

To complete its assignments, the 82nd Airborne Division was divided into three forces. Gavin commanded Force A (parachute): the three parachute infantry regiments and support detachments. The drops were scattered by bad weather and German antiaircraft fire over an area three to four times larger than planned; ironically, this gave the Germans the impression of a much larger force. Two regiments of the division were given the mission of blocking approaches west of the Merderet River, but most of their troops missed their drop zones entirely. The 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment jumped accurately and captured its objective, the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, which proved essential to the success of the division. The 1st Battalion captured bridges over the Merderet at Manoir de la Fière and Chef-du-Pont. Gavin returned from Chef-du-Pont and withdrew all but a platoon to beef up the defense at Manoir de la Fière. About 2.2 miles west of Sainte-Mère-Église and 175 yards east of La Fière Bridge, on Route D15, a historical marker indicates the supposed location of Gavin&#x27;s foxhole.

====Operation Market Garden====
Gavin became the youngest division commander since the Civil War when he assumed command of the 82nd Airborne Division on August 8, 1944, and was promoted to major general in October. For the first time, Gavin would lead the 82nd Airborne Division into combat. On Sunday, September 17, Operation Market Garden took off. Market Garden, devised by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, consisted of an airborne attack of three British and American airborne divisions. The 82nd was to take the bridge across the Maas River in Grave, seize at least one of four bridges across the Maas–Waal Canal, and the bridge across the Waal river in Nijmegen. The 82nd was also to take control of the high grounds in the vicinity of Groesbeek, a small Dutch town near the German border. The ultimate objective of the offensive was Arnhem.

In the drop into the Netherlands, Gavin landed on hard pavement instead of grass, injuring his back. He had it inspected by a doctor a few days later, who claimed that his back was fine, and so Gavin continued normally throughout the entirety of the war. Five years later, he had his back examined at Walter Reed Hospital, where he learned that he had, in fact, fractured two discs in the jump.

The failure of the 82nd to secure the Nijmegen Bridge on Day 1 of the operation delayed the XXX Corps relief column 36 hours and is considered one of several key reasons for the failure of the entire operation. As such, much controversy has swirled around the reasons for the delay and making the nearby Groesbeek Heights the priority. The contemporaneous reports of Lieutenant Colonel Norton (82nd G3) states that Gavin ordered Colonel Roy Lindquist (508th) to &quot;attempt to seize the Nijmegen Bridge with a small force, not to exceed a battalion.&quot; With rumors of a large German armored formation nearby, Gavin initially made the decision to move most of his troops to the Groesbeek Heights rather than securing the Nijmegen Bridge. This decision left Lindquist confused about his orders, leading to the vital bridge being reinforced and in German hands for a further 36 hours. This seriously delayed XXX Corps relief of 1st Airborne Div at Arnhem and jeopardized the entire operation. The 504th took the bridge across the Waal river, but it was too late as the British paras of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, 1st Parachute Brigade of the British 1st Airborne Division, could not hold on any longer to their north side of the Arnhem Bridge and were defeated. The 82nd would stay in the Netherlands until November 13, when it was transferred to new billets in Sisonne et Suippes, France.

====Battle of the Bulge and end of the war in Europe====
Gavin also led the 82nd during its fighting in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945. The division was in SHAEF reserve in France at the start of the battle, and deployed as part of the Allied reaction to the German offensive. It operated in the northern sector of the battle, defending the towns of La Gleize and Stoumont against attacks by Kampfgruppe Peiper and elements of three Waffen-SS Panzer divisions. After the German offensive stalled, Gavin led the 82nd during the Allied counterattack in January 1945 that erased the German penetration.

After helping to secure the Ruhr, the 82nd Airborne Division ended the war at Ludwigslust past the Elbe River, accepting the surrender of over 150,000 men of Lieutenant General Kurt von Tippelskirch&#x27;s 21st Army. When Gavin&#x27;s 82nd crossed the river, in company with the British 6th Airborne Division, the 82nd Airborne Division moved 36 miles in one day and captured over 100,000 troops, causing great laughter in Bradley&#x27;s 12th Army Group headquarters.

Following Germany&#x27;s surrender, the 82nd Airborne Division entered Berlin for occupation duty, lasting from April until December 1945. In Berlin General George S. Patton was so impressed with the 82nd&#x27;s honor guard he said, &quot;In all my years in the Army and all the honor guards I have ever seen, the 82nd&#x27;s honor guard is undoubtedly the best.&quot; Hence the &quot;All-American&quot; division also became known as &quot;America&#x27;s Guard of Honor&quot;. The war ended before their scheduled participation in the Allied invasion of Japan, Operation Downfall.

===Post–World War II career===

Gavin also played a central role in racially integrating the US military, beginning with his incorporation of the all-black 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion into the 82nd Airborne Division. The 555th&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Bradley Biggs, referred to Gavin as perhaps the most &quot;color-blind&quot; Army officer in the entire service. Biggs&#x27; unit distinguished itself as &quot;smokejumpers&quot; in 1945, combating forest fires and disarming Japanese balloon bombs.

After the war, Gavin went on to high postwar command. He was a key player in stimulating the discussions which led to the Pentomic Division. As Army Chief of Research and Development and public author, he called for the use of mechanized troops transported by air to become a modern form of cavalry. He proposed deploying troops and light armored fighting vehicles by glider (or specially designed air dropped pod), aircraft, or helicopter to perform reconnaissance, raids, and screening operations. This led to the Howze Board, which had a great influence on the Army&#x27;s use of helicopters, first seen during the Vietnam War.

Citing what he described as the &quot;deteriorating&quot; condition of the army, Gavin announced his retirement as a lieutenant general in January 1958, nine years before mandatory retirement at the age of 60. During his four years as head of research and development, the army&#x27;s budget had decreased from $12.6 billion to $8.6 billion; Gavin said that he would have to defend the military budget before Congress but &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in next year&#x27;s budget&quot;. Stating that &quot;I feel I can do more on the outside for national defense than on the inside&quot;, he refused Secretary of the Army Wilbur Brucker&#x27;s offer of promotion to full general to not retire. He wrote a book, &quot;War and Peace in the Space Age&quot;, published in mid-1958, which, among other things, detailed his reasons for leaving the army.

==Later years and death==
Upon retiring from the US Army, Gavin was recruited by an industrial research and consulting firm, Arthur D. Little, Inc. (ADL) He began as a vice president in 1958, became president of the company in 1960 and eventually served as both president and chairman of the board until his retirement in 1977. During his tenure at ADL, he grew a $10 million domestic company into a $70 million international company. Gavin remained as a consultant with ADL after his retirement. He served on the boards of several Boston organizations—the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and Northeastern University—and some business boards as well.

In 1961, US President John F. Kennedy asked Gavin to take a leave of absence from ADL and serve as U.S. ambassador to France. Kennedy hoped Gavin would be able to improve deteriorating diplomatic relations with France, due to his experiences with the French during World War II, and his wartime relationship with France&#x27;s president, General Charles de Gaulle. This proved to be a successful strategy and Gavin served as ambassador to France in 1961 and 1962. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter considered the 70-year-old Gavin for Director of the CIA before settling on Admiral Stansfield Turner.

Along with David Shoup and Matthew Ridgway, Gavin became one of the more visible former military critics of the Vietnam War. Due to this antiwar stance, Allard Lowenstein, leader of the Dump Johnson movement, asked him to oppose President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1968 Democratic primaries, but Gavin declined. In 1968, Gavin endorsed Nelson Rockefeller for the Republican presidential nomination.

Gavin was portrayed by Robert Ryan in &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, and by Ryan O&#x27;Neal in &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;. Gavin served as an advisor on both films.

James Gavin died on 23 February 1990, and is buried to the immediate east of the Old Chapel at the United States Military Academy Post Cemetery at West Point. He was survived by his widow, Jean, his five daughters, ten grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

==Private life==
Gavin had a daughter named Barbara with his first wife. Barbara saved the letters her father sent to her during the war, and used them to write a 2007 book, &quot;The General and His Daughter: The War Time Letters of General James Gavin to his Daughter Barbara&quot;. Gavin had a reputation as a womanizer. Among his wartime lovers were the film star Marlene Dietrich and journalist Martha Gellhorn. Gavin and his wife Irma divorced after World War II in 1947. He married Jean Emert Duncan of Knoxville, Tennessee, in July 1948 and remained married to her until his death in 1990. He adopted Jean&#x27;s daughter, Caroline Ann, by her first marriage. He and Jean had three daughters, Patricia Catherine, Marjorie Aileen, and Chloe Jean.

==Memorials==
The street that leads to the Waal Bridge in Nijmegen is now called General James Gavin Street. Near to the location of his parachute drop during Operation Market-Garden in Groesbeek a residential area is named in his honour.

A street in Thorpe Astley, a suburb of Leicester, England, was named Gavin Close in his honour. Thorpe Astley forms part of Braunstone Town in which Gavin was stationed at Braunstone Hall, prior to the D-Day landings.

There is also a small memorial in his native Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, where he grew up, commemorating his service. There are also two memorials in Osterville, Massachusetts, where he and his family spent summers for many years. In 1975, American Electric Power completed the 2,600-megawatt General James M. Gavin Power Plant on the Ohio River, near Cheshire, Ohio. The plant boasts dual stacks of 830 feet and dual cooling towers of 430 feet. It is the largest coal-fired power facility in Ohio, and one of the largest in the nation.

In 1986, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment created the &quot;Gavin Squad Competition&quot;. This competition was designed to identify the most proficient rifle squad in the regiment. The original competition was won by a squad from 1st Platoon, Bravo Company, 3/505th PIR. Gavin was on hand to award the nine man squad their trophy. The competition is still held every year if the wartime deployment schedule allows it.

The Gavin Cup is an award recognizing the top Company/Troop/Battery-level organization in the 82nd Airborne Division. Awarded on a quarterly basis, the award criteria are centered on unit readiness and competition amongst all Company/Troop/Battery-sized units in the division and is two-phased. The first is submission of unit readiness-based metrics data. The top three scoring units send teams deliberately selected on short notice to compete in marksmanship, physical fitness, and combat preparation. The top scoring unit is awarded the Gavin Cup.

<text>Legia Warszawa (), commonly referred to as Legia Warsaw or simply Legia, is a professional football club based in Warsaw, Poland. Legia is the most successful Polish football club in history, winning a record 15 champions titles, a record 20 Polish Cup and 5 Polish Super Cup trophies. The club&#x27;s home venue is the Polish Army Stadium (&quot;Stadion Wojska Polskiego&quot;). Legia is the only Polish club never to have been relegated from the top flight of Polish football since World War II (see: 1936 Legia Warsaw season).

Legia was formed between 5 and 15 March 1916 during military operations in World War I, as the main football club of the Polish Legions. After the war, the club was reactivated on 14 March 1920 in an officer casino in Warsaw as Wojskowy Klub Sportowy Warszawa, renamed Legia in 1923 after merger with another local club, Korona. It became the main official football club of the Polish Army – Wojskowy Klub Sportowy Legia Warszawa (). From 1949 to 1957, Legia was known as CWKS Warszawa ()

Before 8 April 2004, it was owned by Pol-Mot and from 8 April 2004 (sold for 3 million zlotys) until 9 January 2014, it was owned by media conglomerate ITI Group. The club is currently owned by Dariusz Mioduski who serves as the club&#x27;s chairman.

== Names ==
==History==

===Formation and beginnings===
Legia was formed between 5 and 15 March 1916 during military operations in World War I on the Eastern Front in the village of Kostiuchnówka, within the region of Volhynia (Polish: &quot;Wołyń&quot;). It served as the main football club of the Polish Legions, who at the time fought for Austria-Hungary. The formation of the club in 1916 was greatly influenced by the outbreak of the First World War, because many Polish soldiers were involved in the formation of the Polish Legions before the war. Soldiers, often young men from the south of Poland (mainly from Kraków and Lwów) played football before the war, and therefore, after the formation of the team, they soon became successful. Football was a good way of spending free time, in the calm moments at the front, football matches were organized, which required the ball, making provisional goals, and finding a dozen or so players.

The first team training began in the spring of 1915 in Piotrków, between 5 and 15 March 1916 – at the request of then Master Sergeant Zygmunt Wasserab (pre-war player of Pogoń Stryj) – who was a part of the Polish Legion&#x27;s Commanding Staff in Kostiuchnówka in Volhynia to create a football club. The president of the organization was Władysław Groele, and corporal Stanisław Mielech proposed the name &quot;Sporting Team Legia&quot;, which was adopted (more commonly used term of the team later became Legionowa). Other names were: &quot;Legion Command Squad&quot; and &quot;Styr&quot;. White-black colors and arms were also shown, showing the white letter &quot;L&quot; (symbol of the Legions) on the black dial. The players were dressed in white clothes with sloping black belts, which was a reference to Czarni Lwów.

In the spring of 1916, the team played a number of matches with other teams, most of which ended with Legia victorious. The oldest recorded matches are: 7–0 with the Divisional Sanitary Division, 3–3 with the 6th Infantry Regiment and two victories (6–4 and 3–1) with the 4th Infantry Regiment. In July 1916 – because of the Brusilov Offensive – the Legions began to retreat west and the club relocated to Warsaw. The first match in which Polonia Warsaw was the rival was held on 29 April 1917 at Agrykola Park and ended with a 1–1 draw. Of the nine games played in Warsaw, Legia won six and drew three. At the first away game the team won a 2–1 victory over the then Polish champion KS Cracovia in Kraków, so Legia became an unofficial champion of the country. In 1918 the war ended, but the team continued to play only amateur-friendly matches.

===1920s and 1930s===
The club was reactivated on 14 March 1920. In the officers&#x27; casinos in the Royal Castle, a group of former officers formed the Military Sports Club (WKS) -Wojskowy Klub Sportowy- Warsaw, establishing the white and red colors of the statute. Among them was Zygmunt Wasserab, one of the founders of the club.

Due to the Polish-Bolshevik war and the participation of many Warsaw players, WKS was not nominated for the premiership of the Polish championship league in 1920. In the 1921–1926 seasons, the team was not promoted beyond the A-class of the Warsaw district, but it was a very important period for the club. In 1922, a statute was passed allowing the team to play in civilian teams (as opposed to playing against only other soldiers). Zygmunt Wassarab and Jerzy Misiński worked together and the club&#x27;s name was changed to the Military Sports Club &quot;Legia&quot; Warsaw. It was modeled on the document of Pogoń Lwów. At that time, a merger with the oldest Warsaw sports club, Korona, was created, which resulted in the acquisition of new, white-green club colors.

In the first international match played on 18 May 1922, Legia lost 2–9 at their own stadium with Czechoslovakian club FK Viktoria Žižkov. A year later, in the championship of Warsaw, the Army took 3rd place.
After the first-ever promotion beyond Class A in 1927, Legia qualified for the newly formed Polish Football League. Roman Górecki, the then president of the Warsaw team, became the first president of the Polish League. Their debut was on 8 May in Łódź – Klub Turystów Łódź was the opponent and the match ended in a 6–1 result. At the same time, Legia player Marian Łańko scored his first league goal free kick and recorded his first hat-trick in club history. In the same year, in a match against Pogonia Lwów, the club suffered the highest league loss, losing 2–11. At the end of the season, Legia finished fifth, despite five defeats at the start of the season. Legia striker Marian Łańko finished second scoring 31 goals. The Warsaw club also made their debut in the Polish Cup, winning the match with Pogoń Warsaw 7–0. For the next two seasons Legia occupied higher positions in the league than the other Warsaw clubs: Polonia and Warszawianka.

In 1930, after three years of construction, the Polish Army Stadium was opened at Łazienkowska Street. In the first match of the new stadium, Legia drew 1–1 with Barcelona. In the same year the legionaries defeated Ruch Hajduki Wielkie 7–1 in their 100th match in the league. Legia also had the biggest pre-war successes in the Polish championships in 1930 and 1931, where they were short three points and one point respectively. Moreover, in the first edition of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs awards for the best results in international competition, the Army received a &quot;traveling&quot; trophy.

In the 1935 season, Legia remained in the league, gaining one point advantage over the relegated Cracovia, and then in 1936 – in the club&#x27;s 20th anniversary – lost seven consecutive games and recorded the only decline of the league in its history. In 1937 the club&#x27;s board decided to return to the military statute. As a result, almost all civilians departed from the first team, mainly to other Warsaw teams. In 1937 – in the A class of the Warsaw district – Legia took fourth place, and one year later, took first place, and played in the first division play-offs. Legia was third place in the play-offs and they were not able to advance. The board reacted by withdrawing the club from all competitions and decided to play only friendly matches. In 1938, most of the team&#x27;s sections were dissolved, leaving only three: tennis, swimming and motocross.

===1940s===
After the end of World War II – in April 1945 – the club was reactivated under the name of I Wojskowy Klub Sportowy Warszawa (1st Military Sports Club Warsaw), and in June added a historical member of Legia. Among the people who contributed to the reconstruction of the club were: Julian Neuding – prewar player of Makabi Warszawa, Karol Rudolf – prewar player of Legia, Henryk Czarnik and Józef Ziemian – Legia players from the interwar period. The team initially played friendly matches with teams in the region, but later also with clubs from other countries, the likes of the Swedish IFK Norrköping and the Yugoslav FK Partizan.

In the first postwar Polish championships held in 1946, Legia took second place in the elimination group, falling out of competition. In 1948, after qualifying for the nine-year break of the highest tier, Legia qualified after a victory in the inter-regional eliminations of the northeastern region and after took second place in the nationwide qualification. Legia eventually took fourth place, drawing 3–3 with Ruch Chorzów. It was the 250th league game of the club. The first post-war match in the first tier took place on 14 March 1948, beating Polonia Bytom 3–1.

For the next two seasons, Legia only held on in the first division due to a better goal differential against the relegated teams, taking the 9th and 10th respectively. In November 1949, after the reforms introduced by the then Polish football association, the club once again changed its name to Centralny Wojskowy Klub Sportowy (Central Army Sports Club). Also, a new coat of arms (large letter C, and smaller letters in it: W, K, S). The official patron of the team was the Polish People&#x27;s Army. Legia became a military club, so it was possible to get players of other clubs, players like Lucjan Brychczy, Ernest Pohl and Edmund Kowal all were brought to Legia.

===1950s===
In 1951, Legia took third place in the league, and in the cup competitions lost in the eighth-finals with Polonia Warszawa. A year later, Legia achieved its first success in the Polish Cup competition, reaching the finals (in which Polonia Warszawa won 1–0). The reserve team reached this stage of the competition, while the first team dropped out in the eighth-finals, losing to Lechia Gdańsk. In the league, the club ranked sixth, and in the Puchar Zlotu Młodych Przodowników (the premiere edition of the League Cup) was eliminated in the group stage. In 1953, Legia took 5th place in the first league, and in the next season – in addition to the 7th place – the team managed to reach the semi-final of the Polish Cup, in which Gwardia Warsaw won 2–1.

Legia won their first trophy on 29 September 1955, defeating Lechia Gdańsk 5–0 in the Polish Cup final. A month later – on 20 November after a 1–1 draw with Zagłębie in Sosnowiec – the club won their first Polish championship. The team trained by the Hungarian coach János Steiner won their first doublet in the history of Polish football. In the following season, Ryszard Koncewicz became the Legia coach. The club celebrated its 40th anniversary and repeated the achievements from the previous year. First he sealed the Polish championship after a 2–2 draw with ŁKS Lodz, and then he defeated in the cup final Górnik Zabrze in a 3–0 win. These successes were accomplished by strengthening the team by means of conscription to the army of players from such clubs as: Polonia Bytom, Ruch Chorzów, or Wawel Kraków. The latter, like most of the then Okręgowych Wojskowych Klubów Sportowych (District Military Sports Clubs, OWKS), was dissolved. Officially due to the &quot;reorganization of the military division&quot;, in practice this meant strengthening CWKS Warszawa (Legia&#x27;s name at the time). The team then won its highest victory in history, defeating Wisła Kraków 12–0 – the match took place on 19 August 1956 in Warsaw. In addition, the first three places in the goal classification at the end of the season were taken by legionnaires, and the title of the king of scorers was won by the Henryk Kempny who scored 21 goals.

In 1956, in addition to winning the national doublet, Legia made their debut in European competition, competing in the round of 16 of the European Champions Cup with Czechoslovak champions Slovan Bratislava. In the first away meeting, the team lost 0–4, and in the second leg at home they won 2–0 after goals from Kowal and Brychcz, but they were eliminated from further games. The meeting in Warsaw was watched by 40,000 fans.

At the meeting on 2 July 1957 – chaired by Colonel Edward Potorejko – the club&#x27;s statute was approved and the first 31-member board of WKS Legia was elected, from which an 11-person presidium was then selected. The legal nature of the club has also changed. From the previous military unit, which was CWKS, a sports association was established with legal personality. The name of the club was also changed, as the historical name Legia was returned (Military Sports Club &quot;Legia&quot; Warsaw). In addition, new colors that are still used today were approved: white-red-green-black (later the order of the first two colors were changed) and the current coat of arms was adopted until today (with intervals).

Legia players (appearing as a Warsaw team) were invited to Spain to play the first match on the new FC Barcelona stadium, Camp Nou on 24 September. The match ended with a 4–2 result for the hosts. They struggled in the league that season, finishing in fourth place, and were knocked out of the Polish Cup at the eighth-finals, losing to Ruch Chorzow 1–2 (in that period, until 1961, the I liga season was played from March to August). In 1958, Legia took 6th place in the Polish championship, and in 1959 took 4th.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, Legia regularly held top positions in the league table. In 1960, artificial lighting was installed at the Polish Army Stadium, thanks to which the facility became the second in Poland where matches could be played after dark. The first meeting without natural light was played on 5 October with Danish club Aarhus Gymnastikforening as part of the qualification for the European Club Champions Cup. Legia won the match 1–0 after Helmut Nowak&#x27;s goal. However, with a 0–3 defeat in the first match in Denmark, they dropped out of further games. In the same season, Tadeusz Błażejewski, in the 11th minute of a 2–2 draw against ŁKS Łódź, scored the thousandth league goal for Legia. The club celebrated another anniversary on 26 October 1960, playing the five-hundredth match in the premier league; Legia beat Zagłębie Sosnowiec 1–0. In the league table Legia took second place, winning the title of runner-up of Poland and losing to Ruch Chorzów by 1 point. The following season, the team won the bronze medal of the Polish championship for taking third place in the league.

In the following year, the league shifted from the spring-fall system to fall-spring, which meant that the league matches started in the spring of 1962. The league was divided into two groups, in which the teams from the same regions played with each other. Legia – which took third place in its group – won the competition for 5th place with Wisła Kraków, drew a 1–1 away match and won 4–1 at home. In the Polish Cup, the team dropped out in the eighth-finals, losing 0–3 with Odra Opole. In the 1962–1963 season with the new league system, the team took the 7th place, and the fight for the Polish Cup again ended at stage eighth-finals (losing to later winner, Zagłębie Sosnowiec, 0–2).

Legia ended the 1963–64 season in fourth place in the league, scoring the same number of goals as second place Zagłębie Sosnowiec and third place Odra Opole. The goal differential decided who took which place. The club achieved a much better result in the Polish Cup, where the team, led by the Romanian coach Virgil Popescu, reached the finals. In the match, played at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium, Legia won after extra time with Polonia Bytom 2–1. Henryk Apostel scored both goals for Legia. In the next season Legia again took 4th place in the league, and in the Polish Cup reached the semi-final, in which they lost after extra time 1–2 with Górnik Zabrze (who became the winner of the cup). The team also competed in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In the first round, Legia eliminated the Austrian FC Admira Wacker Mödling. In the second they defeated the Turkish Galatasaray SK. After two matches there was a draw and third (the decisive step in the advancement) meeting in Bucharest. Legia won 1–0 and were the first Polish team to advance to the quarterfinals of any European club competition. At this stage of the tournament the team lost to German TSV 1860 Munich and was eliminated from the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puchar Zdobywców Pucharów 1964/1965, 1/4 finału PZP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebration of the 50th anniversary of the club&#x27;s existence took place in 1966. In the league the team took 6th place, while a better result was achieved in the twelfth edition of the Polish Cup. In the game played on 15 August at the Warta Poznań stadium, Legia won after extra time in the final, beating Górnik Zabrze 2–1, with Bernard Blaut scoring in the last minute. Winning the Polish Cup allowed the club to compete in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the 1966–67 season. In the round of 16, Legia was knocked out by FC Sachsen Leipzig after losing 0–3 away and drawing 2–2 at home. The team came fourth in the league table, and in the Polish Cup was eliminated after a 1–3 defeat in the eighth-finals with Wisła Kraków. That season, Kazimierz Deyna made his debut in the Legia team.

In the 1967–68 season, for the second time in its history, the club was the vice-champion of Poland and was promoted as the first Polish team to the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In the Polish Cup Legia was knocked out by GKS Katowice in the eighth-finals. In the same year, the team made their debut in the Intertoto Cup. Legia won their group, but did not advance to the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup because the matches of the Intertoto Cup were not official UEFA competitions. Legia, led by Czechoslovakian trainer Jaroslav Vejvoda, finished the 1968–69 season in first place in the table, thus winning the third Polish championship. The team reached the final of the Polish Cup, in which they lost to Górnik Zabrze 0–2. The club also made its debut at the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In the first round Legia won twice, 6–0 and 3–2 against TSV 1860 Munich. In the next round they won 0–1 and 2–0 against Belgian team Waregem, and the third opponent was Újpest FC. In the next round, the Hungarian team&#x27;s players were better and Legia were defeated 0–1 away. A 2–2 draw in Warsaw saw their rivals promoted to the next stage. In 1969 there was still one more success – the Legia juniors won the first championship in the history of the club.
For the next season, former player Edmund Zientara was brought in as the new first team coach. His team won the title of Polish champion for the second time in a row. In the struggle for the Polish Cup, Legia was eliminated in the semi-final with Ruch Chorzów. The performances of the club in the European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup was a great success – Legia reached the semi-finals of the competition. In the round of 16, they defeated Romanian club FC UTA Arad 2–1 and 8–0, French club Saint-Étienne in the eighth-finals 2–1 and 1–0, and Turkish club Galatasaray in the quarter-finals 2–1 and 1–0. In the semi-final, they played against Feyenoord. The first match in Warsaw ended in a 0–0 draw, while away the home team triumphed 2–0.

===1970s===
The 1970s were known as Poland&#x27;s golden age of football. In 1971, Legia were runner&#x27;s up of Poland for the third time in their history, and ended their Polish Cup campaign in the quarter-finals. For the second year in a row the club competed in the European Club Champions Cup, where it reached the quarter-finals, dropping out against Atlético Madrid (2–1 and 0–1). They previously eliminated IFK Gothenburg (4–0, 2–1) and Standard Liège (0–1, 2–0). From December 1971 to February 1972, Legia went on a tour of Spain and the countries of South America, including Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia – this was the first time the team had visited this part of the world. In the 1971–72 season, the team finished third in the league table and lost in the Polish Cup final with Górnik Zabrze 2–5. In September 1972, the Warsaw club defeated Víkingur Reykjavík in the round of 16 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup 9–0, which is the highest Polish team win in European competition. In the next round Legia was matched up against A.C. Milan. The first game was played at the 10th Anniversary Stadium and ended in a 1–1 draw. At the San Siro, after the regular time, the draw was also maintained – Milan scored the winning goal two minutes before the end of extra time to win the game 2–1. In that season, Legia took 8th place in the league and won its fifth Polish Cup – after eliminating Szombinrek in the semi-finals (3–1 and 1–1). In the final match against Polonia, on 17 June 1973 in Poznań, a goalless result was maintained for 90 minutes of regular time of the game, as well as for the entire extra time. The legionaries finally won in penalties, 4–2.

The season of 1973–74 began with a defeat in the round of 16 of the European Club Champions Cup in aggregate with PAOK FC (1–1 in Warsaw, 0–1 in Thessaloniki). In early 1974, the club went to Spain and France to face Barcelona (1–1 at Camp Nou) and RC Lens (0–2). The team finished the league competition in 4th place, and in the Polish Cup they were knocked out in the quarterfinals, losing 1–2 to Stal Rzeszów. Right after the end of the league, the legionnaires went to an international tournament that took place in the Canary Islands – they drew with Cádiz CF, won with CD Tenerife and Hércules CF. Another foreign trip took place at the end of January 1975. Legia flew to Australia and became the first Polish team to visit all continents (except Antarctica). Legia took 6th place in the league, and lost in the round of 16 in the Polish Cup. After the season, the first transfer of Polish player to the West took place, which was allowed by PZPN and the Ministry of Sport. Robert Gadocha was bought by FC Nantes, later French champions.

Legia in the 1975–76 season finished the league in the middle of the table (8th place), and in the Polish Cup reached the eighth-finals, where they lost to GKS Jastrzębie after penalties. In the autumn of 1976, the club&#x27;s 60th anniversary was celebrated. On the anniversary, 12 October, two matches were played at the Polish Army stadium: a meeting with Legia and Warsaw Polonia (a 2–0 home win) and a match between Legia and Dukla, which ended 4–2 for the legionaries. In February 1977 the team made the next trip, this time to Indonesia. Six games were played at that time (four wins, two draws) and a total of 15 goals were scored – without Deyna, who was at a training camp in Yugoslavia and Greece. Legia also performed for the second time in the Intertoto Cup. Legia&#x27;s opponents were: Landskrona BoIS (1–0 and 2–1), SK Slavia Prague (1–1 and 2–2) and BSC Young Boys (4–1 and 1–1). Legia took second place in the group and once again was not rewarded with a promotion to the UEFA Cup. The team – finishing in 8th position – repeated the result from the previous league season, while in the Polish Cup they were knocked out in the semi-final, losing to Polonia Bytom 1–2.

During the second half of the 1970s, the legionaries did not make it to the top 3 positions to get into European competitions, and 5th place in the 1977–78 season was their highest position. In addition, the team repeated the result obtained a year earlier in the Polish Cup – Legia reached the semi-final, in which they were knocked out by Zagłębie Sosnowiec after penalties. The next season (1978–79) was the last in which Kazimierz Deyna represented the club. In addition, the club played their 1000th game in the highest football tier – the match took place on 25 April against Lech in Poznań (a 1–2 defeat). The season ended with a 6th-place finish in the league and at the eighth-final stage of the Polish Cup (where they lost against Zagłębie II Lubin 1–2). On 18 September 1979, a farewell to Kazimierz Deyna took place – a friendly with English club Manchester City, who had agreed to his transfer for £100,000. The game ended 2–1 to Legia. Deyna played the whole match and scored two goals – one for Legia (in the first half) and the second for his new club (in the second). The match was very popular and many fans had to watch it from behind the stadium gates.

===1980s===
Legia started the decade by winning the Polish Cup, beating Lech Poznań 5–0 in the final on 9 May 1980. In the league, the legionaries took third place. A year later, the Warsaw club defended the Polish Cup with a 1–0 victory over Pogoń Szczecin on 24 June, but struggled in the league, finishing fifth place. The following season, the team played a match in the quarter-finals of the European Club Champions Cup with Dinamo Tbilisi. During the first meeting in Warsaw, fans, due to the very large number of policemen at the stadium, began to chant the slogans: &quot;Down with communism&quot; and &quot;MO – Gestapo&quot;. After being defeated 0–1, the fans organized an anti-communist parade (this situation was repeated several times in the 1980s). The away match also ended 0–1, which was watched by 90 thousand fans in Tbilisi. In the 1981–82 season Legia finished fourth, and in the Polish Cup they were knocked out in the eighth-finals, losing to Arka Gdynia 1–2.

The 1982–83 season began with a change of part of the team. Legia also gained a new coach, with Kazimierz Górski being replaced by Jerzy Kopa in the middle of the season. Legia finished eighth place in the league table, while in the Polish Cup they fell in the quarterfinals after losing 0–1 against Lech Poznań in Warsaw. A year later, Legia finished fifth in the fight for the title, and in the Polish Cup reached the 5th round, where they lost against Górnik Zabrze 2–3 after extra time.

At the turn of 1984 and 1985, after the autumn round, Legia took first place in the table. They finished runners-up of Poland, which meant the club would participate in the UEFA Cup. In addition, the team reached the quarter-finals of the Polish Cup (a defeat in aggregate with Górnik Zabrze). The following season, 1985–86, the league success was repeated and the quarterfinals of the home cup were again obtained. Both titles went to Górnik Zabrze. In the same years, the legionaries made it to the round of 16 and eighth-finals of the UEFA Cup, losing twice with Inter Milan. In the first match, Milan drew 0–0 at home, which was considered a great success for the Warsaw club. The return match at Łazienkowska ended with the score 0–1 and the Italian team advanced to the next round. The next year in 1986 Legia faced Inter Milan again with a 3–2 win at Łazienkowska and a 0–1 defeat in Italy, which eliminated the Polish club on away goals.

At the beginning of the 1986–87 season, the Warsaw team traveled to China and won the Great Wall Cup, defeating the hosts 2–0. The team played in Beijing and other cities for a week, at the turn of July and August. Following this, apart from other successful performance in Europe, Legia took 5th place in the league and reached the 5th round of knockout (losing against Wisła Kraków after penalties). At the end of 1987, at the Legia stadium, the speedway track was removed and the football field was widened.

Legia finished the next year in the league in third place and reached the Polish Cup final. In Łódź, the legionaries drew 1–1 with Lech and the victory was decided by penalty kicks, which the Poznań team won 3–2. A year later, the Warsaw team took fourth place in the league and won the Polish Cup at the stadium in Olsztyn, beating Jagiellonia Białystok 5–2. Two weeks after the success, they also won the Polish Super Cup for the first time, defeating Ruch Chorzów 3–0 in Zamość.

The trophy gained in Zamość was the first piece of silverware after the reorganization of the club – on 25 April 1989, the club&#x27;s board decided to separate the football section from the multi-sport section CWKS and establish the Autonomous Football Section (ASPN CWKS &quot;Legia&quot; Warsaw).

On 1 September, long-time footballer and Legia captain, Kazimierz Deyna, died in a car accident in San Diego.

At the end of the decade, on 13 September, Legia competed against FC Barcelona in the first round of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The match in Barcelona ended with a 1–1 draw, after an unrecognized goal for the legionnaires and a penalty kick for the opponents in the 85th minute of the match. In the rematch at Łazienkowska Legia lost 0–1, with 25 thousand fans in the stands. Michael Laudrup scored the only goal.

===1990s===
The beginning of the nineties was not successful for the club, especially in the Polish league. In the 1989–90 season, the team finished in seventh place, and the next season in ninth. The 1991–92 season ended in a 10th-place finish – for the first time since World War II, Legia was fighting relegation to the second league. The team avoided relegation after winning 3–0 in an away match against Motor Lublin in the penultimate game of the season. The club achieved better results in the Polish Cup. In 1990, Legia defeated GKS Katowice in the final and won their ninth trophy. A year later, the Warsaw club again faced GKS Katowice in the final of the Polish Cup, but this time the rivals who won the match 1–0 turned out to be better. The next season, 1989–90, Legia won their ninth Polish Cup, meaning they were able to play in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1990–91. The Warsaw team, managed by Władysław Stachurski reached the semi-finals of the tournament, eliminating the likes of Sampdoria and Aberdeen. They lost in the semi-finals to Manchester United (1–3 in Warsaw and 1–1 in Manchester).

In autumn 1992, the first private sponsor, businessman Janusz Romanowski, invested in the club. A two-year sponsorship deal was signed with FSO (worth PLN 2.4 billion at that time) as well as with Adidas. After the fourth round of the 1992–93 season, Janusz Wójcik became the Legia coach. The high budget from the sponsorship deals allowed players such as Maciej Śliwowski and Radosław Michalski to be brought in. This, in turn, translated into better results and joining the competition for the national championship. On 20 June 1993, after an away victory of 6–0 against Wisła Kraków, the team won the Polish championship. However, on the next day the president of the PZPN board, with a 5–4 vote, decided to take the title from Legia and award it to the third team in the table – Lech Poznań (after disallowing the last matches of Legia and ŁKS, the team from Poznań took first place in the table). The decision was due to the allegations of bribery in the last league match. In addition, Legia was forced to pay a fine of 500 million zlotys, and the UEFA authorities excluded the team from European competition. Twice (December 2004, January 2007),the club unsuccessfully requested that the unfavorable decision should be repealed and that the title should be restored. In the same season, the anti-doping committee decided that Legia player Roman Zub had played after doping before the match against Widzew Łódź. The player&#x27;s urine sample was also tested in a laboratory in Moscow, where it was considered that increased testosterone levels were not the result of doping. The match was initially verified as a walkover for the Łódź team, but the decision of the PZPN games department was revoked by the president of the board.

In the next season, Legia won the first triple crown in the history of Polish football. On 15 June 1994, thanks to a 1–1 draw in the last round with Górnik Zabrze in Warsaw, the legionaries maintained a one-point advantage over second place GKS Katowice and won their fifth Polish title, despite the fact that the season began with three negative points due to the events of the last round in the last season. After the match the press published accusations of corruption with referee Sławomir Redzinski, who, when the score was 1–0 to Górnik, sent off three of the Górnik players. These allegations have not been proven. On 18 June, in the Polish Cup final held at the Legia stadium, the Legia defeated ŁKS Łódź 2–0 and won the tenth trophy in their history. In the match for the Super Cup (24 July), Legia also faced ŁKS Łódź and won 6–4 at the stadium in Płock. The club&#x27;s first experience of the Champions League ended in defeat in the qualifying stage – the team fell to Croatian side Hajduk Split (0–1 at home, 0–4 away).

The next season began with the signing of a contract with Canal+ for broadcasting matches (the first match of the Polish league broadcast was the match of Legia against GKS Katowice, which took place on 1 April 1995). On 31 May 1995, Legia won their sixth Polish championship after a 3–0 victory against Raków Częstochowa in Warsaw, and also won the Polish Cup (2–0 in the final with GKS Katowice). At that time, one of the first protest actions took place at the stadium. The reason was high ticket prices and the ban on hanging flags and banners on the fence – the conflict ended after three matches in Warsaw thanks to an agreement with activists. After winning the championship in the 1994–95 season, Legia Warszawa qualified for the Champions League – in the last qualifying round it defeated the Swedish team IFK Göteborg (1–0 in Warsaw and 2–1 in Gothenburg). In the group stage, Legia drew with Rosenborg BK, Spartak Moscow and Blackburn Rovers. Legia finished the group in second place (with seven points) and in the quarterfinals they faced Panathinaikos Athens. The first match in Warsaw ended in a goalless draw, and in the rematch at the Olympic Stadium in Athens, the Greeks won 3–0. The club did not defend the national championship in the 1995–96 competition and took second place in the league table (behind Widzew Łódź).

In 1997, the club was transformed into Sportowa Spółka Akcyjna (SSA) Legia Warsaw and a new sponsor was acquired, South Korean company Daewoo. This season, the legionaries took second place in the league, one reason being a 2–3 loss to Widzew Łódź in the decisive phase of the games (Legia led up until the 85th minute of the match 2–0). The same year Legia went on to win the Polish Cup and the Super Cup. A big change in that period was the addition of Daewoo as a member to the club&#x27;s name (CWKS &quot;Legia-Daewoo&quot; Warsaw) – the new name did not please fans of Legia and was received coldly by them.

The 1997–98 season saw the club&#x27;s last appearance in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. After passing Glenavon in the qualifying round (with a 1–1 draw in Northern Ireland and a 4–0 win in Warsaw), the team fell to Italian team Vicenza Calcio in the first round of the tournament (losing away 0–2 and drawing at home 1–1). In the league the team took 5th place in the table, and in the Polish Cup reached the 1/8 finals, losing to Amica Wronki 0–3. The next season, 1998–99, ended with a bronze medal in the league. In the national cup the team for the second time in a row was eliminated at stage 1/8 of the tournament; This time, GKS Bełchatów was the one to beat the Warsaw team, who after a goalless result in the regular time of the game won 3–2 in the penalty shootout.

The club played its 100th match in European competitions – the meeting with Macedonian team Vardar Skopje as part of the 1/64 UEFA Cup final ended with Legia&#x27;s away victory 5–0 on 12 August 1999. In the 1999–2000 season, Legia took fourth place in the league and did not get to play in the European competitions. In the Polish Cup, the team fell in the quarterfinals to Amica Wronki after a series of penalty kicks (ended with a 3–1 result), while in the League Cup reached the final, in which they lost at home with Polonia Warsaw 1–2.

===2000–2010===
In March 2001, the main shareholder of the club, Daewoo, withdrew from the club&#x27;s financing, and on 1 July the name of the former sponsor was removed from the club&#x27;s name and it was reverted to ASPN CWKS &quot;Legia&quot; Warszawa SSA. 
In the 2000–01 season, the team finished third in the Polish league, and in the Polish Cup lost in the quarterfinals, losing on aggregate 1–4 with Zagłębie Lubin. The same result was achieved by the team in the League Cup – in the quarterfinals of the tournament the team lost to Wisla Kraków, a draw in Warsaw 1–1 and a loss in Kraków 1–3. In the UEFA Cup qualifying round, Legia won against Etzella Ettelbruck (4–0 away, 2–1 in Warsaw), and in the next match they defeated IF Elfsborg (4–1 at home, 6–1 in Sweden). The rival of Legia in the second round was Valencia CF. In the first match at the Polish Army stadium there was a 1–1 draw, but in the rematch the Spaniards won 6–1.

The 2001–02 season, which was led by Dragomir Okuki, ended in Legia&#x27;s seventh championship title (after a 0–0 draw with Odra Wodzisław in Warsaw), as well as a triumph in the Polish League Cup (3–0 and 1–2 in the final with Wisła Kraków). In competing for the Polish Cup, the team reached the quarter-finals, where it lost to Ruch Chorzów (2–4 in Warsaw, 1–0 in Chorzów). Legia played in the Champions League qualifiers in the summer, but in the third round they fell against FC Barcelona – in the first match at Camp Nou, the Catalans won 3–0, in the second they beat Legia 1–0. After defeat against the Spaniards, the Warsaw team competed in the UEFA Cup. In the first round Legia beat FC Utrecht (4–1 at home and 3–1 away), in the second round they were eliminated by Schalke – 2–3 in Warsaw, 0–0 in Gelsenkirchen.

The legionaries finished the 2002–03 season in 4th place, in the Polish Cup they fell in the 3rd round. On 13 June 2003, the name of the club changed to KP &quot;Legia&quot; Warszawa SSA and on the same day the team was greeted by a new coach, Dariusz Kubicki.

The club was purchased by ITI Group on 8 April 2004. The team took second place in the league and played in the Polish Cup final, in which it lost to Lech Poznań. The next season, 2004–05, the Warsaw team came third in the league table, and in the national cup they lost in the semi-final, falling to Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski – 1–1, 1–1, 1–4 on aggregate penalties.

The 2005–06 season was exceptional in the club&#x27;s history – Legia celebrated its 90th anniversary. First, the team dropped out of the UEFA Cup in the second qualifying round (0–1 in Warsaw and 2–4 in Zurich with FC Zürich) and had a weak start in the league. In addition, they only reached the quarter-finals of the Polish Cup, losing on the aggregate with Korona Kielce. Nevertheless, the legionaries won the eighth Polish championship after winning 1–0 in a match against Górnik Zabrze. After the arrival of the new coach Dariusz Wdowczyk, they managed to make up for seven points when they were behind Wisła Kraków and reach for the title; The Warsaw City Council decided at that time to finance the modernization of the Legia stadium through the construction of three new grandstands and the extension of the covered grandstand. After four years, the legionnaires again stood a chance of winning promotion to the group stage of the Champions League. In the second round of qualifying they beat Hafnarfjarðar – 1–0 away, 2–0 at home. Shakhtar Donetsk turned out to be the next rival in the decisive third stage. Both meetings ended with the defeat of Legia – 0–1 in Donetsk and 2–3 in Warsaw. They attempted to make up for the failure playing against Austria Vienna in the first round of the UEFA Cup. However, Legia did not manage to defeat the Austrian opponent; in the first match in Warsaw the team drew 1–1, and in the return the hosts won 1–0.
In following competitions, Legia dropped out of the fight for the Polish Cup in the 1/16 finals, falling to fourth-division team Stal Sanok, and in the league they won third place. In addition, as part of the Ekstraklasa Cup, the team reached the quarterfinals and lost on aggregate with Górnik Łęczna. The year 2007 brought a change of the coat of arms. The club did not agree with CWKS, which had the rights to the previous logo. The club&#x27;s board registered their logotype, boycotted by the fans, because it did not resemble the old mark (despite similar colors and the letter &quot;L&quot; had a different outline and arrangement of colors). Eventually, it was not implemented and it was established that the official sign will be modified with the white letter &quot;L&quot; on the black shield. However, the shape differed from the historical one and resembled a triangle, not like the original coat of arms.

At the beginning of the 2007–08 season in Vilnius there were riots caused by Legia fans, which had their apogee at the stadium of FK Vėtra during the match of the second round of the Intertoto Cup. Hooligans, among others devastated the stadium and attacked the police, as a result of which the match was stopped at 2–0 for the Lithuanian club. A few days later, the UEFA Disciplinary Commission verified the result of the meeting with Vėtra for a 3–0 win for the hosts and banned Legia from the current European Cup and qualifying for European competition (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup, Intertoto Cup) for the next five years. UEFA also forced the Warsaw club to cover all losses caused by rioters at the host stadium. After submitting the appeal, the penalty was temporarily suspended, taking into account the changes made to enhance safety at Legia&#x27;s matches.

At the halfway point of the league games Legia took second place, even though it scored more points than in the championship season 2005–06. The legionaries were ten points behind first place Wisła Kraków. Eventually, the team reached the Polish Cup and Polish Super Cup after winning against Wisla Kraków twice (0–0, 4–3 pen. and 2–1), and also won the runner-up title. The legionaries secured their UEFA Cup performance in the next season. In addition, the team played in the Ekstraklasa Cup final. The meeting played in Grodzisk Wielkopolski was won by the local Dyskobolia, which after the 4–1 victory won the trophy. In the spring round of the competition, the club joined the campaign Let&#x27;s Kick Racism from the Stadium, organized by the Never Again Association – &quot;Nigdy Więcej&quot; – the players ran out on 22 March in a match against Widzew Łódź in shirts with the campaign&#x27;s name.

In the 2008–09 season Legia started by defeating the Belarusian club FC Gomel (0–0 and 4–1) in the first round of the UEFA Cup qualifying round. In the second the legionaries went to the Russian FC Moscow. Both matches ended with the defeat of legionnaires: in Warsaw 1–2, and in Moscow 0–2. The only goal scored for Legia was by Roger Guerreiro. In the league, the team repeated the previous year&#x27;s achievement, finishing second at the end of the season. The team also reached the semi-finals of the Polish Cup, in which they lost to Ruch Chorzow. In the competition for the Ekstraklasa Cup, Legia appeared in the quarterfinals and was eliminated by GKS Bełchatów.

===2011–2020===

Legia won its 10th title with another league championship at the end of the 2013–14 Ekstraklasa season. Legia qualified for the 2016–17 Champions League group stages for the first time in 21 years after defeating Dundalk on 23 August 2016. The Legionnaires found themselves in group F with the likes of Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, and Sporting Lisbon. They finished third place after winning 1–0 against Sporting Lisbon on the last match day in the group stages, sending them to the round of 32 in the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League. Legia was drawn against Ajax where the first match fell goalless in Warsaw.
Legia won its 12th League title in the 2016–17 Ekstraklasa season. They finished with a 0–0 draw against Lechia Gdańsk. Legia needed a draw in the match between Jagiellonia Białystok and Lech Poznań which finished 2–2 and gave Legia the title.

Legia&#x27;s third consecutive Eksrtaklasa title was won in dramatic circumstances. Needing to win away to Lech Poznan to guarantee the title, a 3–0 victory was awarded to Legia after the game was abandoned. Lech fans threw flares and invaded the pitch after Legia scored to make it 2–0 in the 77th minute, after which the referee called the game off. The result meant Legia won the league, finishing three points above second placed Jagiellonia Białystok.

===2021–present===
On 28 April 2021, three rounds before the end of the 2020–21 Ekstraklasa season, the players from Łazienkowska won the fifteenth Polish championship, thanks to a goalless draw between Jagiellonia Białystok and Raków Częstochowa. Thus, Legia took the independent lead in the all-time classification in terms of the number of domestic titles.

On 26 August 2021, Legia defeated Slavia Prague, and for the first time in five years qualified to the group stages of a European cup. In the UEFA Europa League they were drawn to play in a group stage against Leicester City, Napoli and Spartak Moscow. After the first two matches won, away with Spartak and at home with Leicester 1–0 each, Legia lost four consecutive matches and ended up at the bottom of the group.
In 2023, Legia won two major trophies: the Polish Cup and the Polish Super Cup, both winning over Raków Częstochowa after a penalty shoot-out series. In the 2023–24 season, Legia Warsaw took part in the UEFA Europa Conference League group stage for the first time in its history, where they were drawn into Group E alongside Aston Villa, AZ and Zrinjski Mostar. Following their opening 3–2 victory over Aston Villa, Legia earned a total of 12 points and advanced to the knockout round play-offs out of second place.

==Stadium &amp; facilities==

Legia plays its games at Legia Warsaw Municipal Stadium of Marshal Józef Piłsudski (Polish: &quot;Stadion Miejski Legii Warszawa im. Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego&quot;), traditionally also referred to as the Polish Army Stadium (Polish: &quot;Stadion Wojska Polskiego&quot;), which is an all-seater football-specific stadium in Warsaw, Poland. Legia has been playing there since 9 August 1930. With space for 31,103 spectators it is the 5th biggest football stadium in the . The stadium underwent significant reconstruction between 2008 and 2011, during which all of the stands were demolished and replaced with bigger and more modern ones which increased the stadium&#x27;s capacity from 13,500 to 31,103 seats. The Polish Army Stadium is currently owned by the City of Warsaw. Additionally to the main stadium and its surrounding infrastructure, the club has a newly built Legia Training Center completed in June 2020. Facility is located in Książenice in Gmina Grodzisk Mazowiecki. Legia Training Center has been designated for the Legia Warsaw first team and their reserves and youth teams, as U18, U17, U16 and U15. The center facilities are, among others, eight pitches; six with natural turf and two with artificial turf, hotel part and dormitory for players aged 13–18.
==Sponsors==


==Supporters and rivalries==
As one of the most successful clubs in Poland, Legia Warsaw is also one of its most popular clubs. Legia has gained devotion from generations of fans from Warsaw as well as around the country, mainly in Masovian Voivodeship. Legia supporters are considered very spontaneous, dedicated and fanatical. Accordingly, in terms of quality of football support, they are also often described as the best supporters in Poland. Groups of fans follow Legia for practically all away matches, both domestic and international. Supporters of Legia occasionally attract also some negative attention, in particular after events such as riots in Lithuania during a match against Vėtra Vilnius on 10 July 2007.

The beginning of Legia Warsaw&#x27;s organized fan movement is associated with matches in European cups, in the 1970s, when Legia fans came into contact with Western fan culture. Above all, for Legia fans, the April 1, 1970 match against Feyenoord was a breakthrough. Impressed by the way the clubs&#x27; colors and symbols were worn and displayed by the Dutch fans, a large group of Legia fans began to imitate them.

Traditionally, the most devoted and spontaneous fans occupy the Żyleta stand in their stadium. Before the stadium renovation (2008–2011), the &quot;old&quot; Żyleta referred only to the center section within the eastern stand of the stadium (occasionally, it would also refer to eastern stand as a whole). There is a special exhibition dedicated to the &quot;old&quot; Żyleta in the Legia Warsaw Museum. Today, after the stadium&#x27;s renovation, the &quot;new&quot; Żyleta means the whole northern stand of stadium (located behind the goal).

As regards their political sentiments, the supporters of Legia tend to be more right wing. During communist times, in particular during the 1980s, Legia fans showed their patriotic, nationalist and strongly anti-communistic views. Today, the fans actively participate in annual commemorations of the Warsaw Uprising and Polish Independence Day. Legia fans are also vocal with their views on domestic issues, e.g. their conflict with former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, as well as on international politics, e.g. by way of displaying banners reading &quot;Kosovo is Serbian&quot; at the stadium. On 22 October 2014, when Legia played against the Ukrainian club Metalist Kharkiv they displayed a banner with the names Lwów (Lviv) and Wilno (Vilnius) along with the flag and a prewar coat of arms of Poland on the background, which led to negative reactions. On 19 August 2015, in Lviv and Kyiv, where Legia played with Zorya, clashes between Ukrainian and Polish fans occurred. On 9 April 2022, during an away match against Lech Poznań, Legia fans displayed a banner with an image of Putin hanging from a noose in a Spartak Moscow shirt.

Domestically, Legia Warsaw supporters maintain friendly relations with fans of Radomiak Radom, Zagłębie Sosnowiec and Olimpia Elbląg. Internationally, Legia supporters maintain friendly relations with fans of ADO Den Haag and Juventus. Their domestic rivals include almost all the other Polish teams that play at the domestic top-tier league level. Warsaw clubs, Polonia Warsaw, KS Warszawianka and Gwardia Warsaw, were Legia&#x27;s main league rivals, but since 2013 none of them competes in Ekstraklasa. One of their biggest rivals is also Lech Poznań with whom they contest the &quot;Derby of Poland&quot;.

<text>Amica Wronki was a Polish football club based in Wronki, Poland.

The club was invariably linked to Amica, a manufacturer of white goods, predominantly stoves, which gave the club its nickname. The company&#x27;s increasing profits gave the new team tremendous financial clout in the Polish leagues. The club was formed when two clubs were joined, Błękitni Wronki and LZS Czarni Wromet Wróblewo. The new club was named FK Amica Wronki and in just 4 years, the club won promotion from the Fourth Division to the Orange Ekstraklasa.

They have been in the top division in Poland since 1995. In May 2006, they merged with fellow Ekstraklasa team Lech Poznań. The reserve team then became its first team but only lasted one season before it was finally disbanded. In 2007, one of the clubs that was merged that created Amica, Błękitni Wronki was re-founded and is considered to be a phoenix club.

== History ==

=== Foundation and rise ===
The history of SSA Amica Sport goes back to 1992 when the &quot;Amica company&quot; (a white goods manufacturer) wanted to sponsor a football team in the town of Wronki where their factory was located. The Amica company&#x27;s increasing profits gave the new team financial clout in the Polish leagues. The club was formed when two clubs were joined, Błękitni Wronki and LZS Czarni Wromet Wróblewo.
In the 1993–1994 season Amica Wronki were promoted to the third division. The next season the team, led by Jarosław Szuby, won promotion to the second tier. Amica didn&#x27;t stay in the second division for long, because the following season they again won promotion, this time to the Ekstraklasa under Marian Kurowski who took over the job started by former coaches Bogusław Baniak and Horst Panic.

=== Golden era of Ryszard Forbrich ===
The team finished 5th, 5th and 7th in successive seasons to cement themselves as an Ekstraklasa side.

On 13 June 1998, Amica Wronki beat Aluminium Konin 5–3 to win their first Polish Cup and first trophy in their history. Despite the team from Konin being by far the better team, Amica Wronki won in controversial circumstances, with the help of the referee Marek Kowalczyk so obvious that he was given a three-month ban, but the PZPN match observer Alojzy Jarguz inexplicably gave the referee a high note. Impartial observers, such the manager of Lech Poznań Adam Topolski, chairman of Olimpia Poznań (a top flight club at the time) Bolesław Krzyżostaniak, the chief of Zawisza Bydgoszcz Edward Potok and former Górnik Konin manager Janusz Białek were all highly critical of the match they have witnessed. The director of Amica Wronki at the time, Ryszard Forbrich, known as &quot;Fryzjer&quot;, was later revealed to be the leader of an organised crime group, fixing matches all around the country, instrumental to a huge corruption scandal in Polish football. He later admitted to fixing the match in his autobiography. The 1998 cup final however was never investigated, with trophy still belonging to Amica, and remains a sore point for Górnik fans to this day.

On 18 July 1998, Amica Wronki won the Polish Super Cup, contested by the previous season&#x27;s league and cup champions, by beating ŁKS Łódź after a goal by Radosław Biliński.

Amica qualified for the last edition of the now defunct European Cup Winners Cup in the 1998–99 season, playing for the first time against European opposition. They beat Hibernians FC 5–0 in the qualifying round before losing to SC Heerenveen 4–1 on aggregate in the first round. After a disappointing 1998–99 league campaign where they finished in 12th place, they managed to end the season well by winning their second Polish Cup by beating GKS Bełchatów on 13 June 1999. Once more they had the opportunity of playing in Europe through the UEFA Cup, and surprisingly beat Brøndby IF of Denmark 5–4 on aggregate in the first round. They followed up that success by beating league champions Wisła Kraków to win their second Polish Super Cup on 22 September 1999. They were drawn against Spanish team Atlético Madrid in the second round of the Uefa Cup and lost 5–1 on aggregate, before ending the 1999–2000 season in sixth place. Amica won their third Polish Cup on 9 June 2000 in a rematch of the Super Cup game against Wisła Kraków. They appeared in a European competition for the third season in a row and made it to the second round beating FC Vaduz 6–3, FC Alania Vladikavkaz 5–0 and finally losing to Hertha 2–4 and finished the 2000–01 season in 7th place.

In the 2001–02 season, a reshuffle of the Ekstraklasa occurred to lower the number of teams from 18 to 16. Two groups of nine teams were created for the fall season. The spring season consisted of a Championship group consisting of the top five teams in both fall season groups, and a relegation group consisting of the bottom four teams from both fall season groups. Amica finished in fifth place in their group during the fall season with 12 points to qualify for the Championship group and ended the spring season in third. Amica made it to the Polish Cup final for the fourth time but were beaten by Wisła Kraków 8–2 on aggregate. Qualification for the 2002–03 UEFA Cup was accomplished as Polish Cup runners-up because Wisła had won the league title and therefore qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Amica beat Servette FC on the away goals rule after a 4–4 aggregate tie in the first round, before extending their streak of never having qualified past the second round by losing to Málaga CF 4–2 on aggregate and finishing the season in sixth place.

The following campaign fared much better, as a good run of games propelled them to third place in the league and therefore UEFA Cup qualification, the only downside being their elimination from the Polish Cup in the quarter finals. A penalty shoot-out was needed for Amica to beat Hungarians Budapest Honvéd FC 5–4 after a 1–1 aggregate tie in the second qualifying round of the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. A 2–1 victory in the first round against Latvians FK Ventspils was followed by their first appearance in the revamped UEFA Cup group stage. They lost all 4 group games to finish bottom of Group F. They finished in sixth place in the league, thus failing to get into European competition the following season.

=== Merger and disbandment ===
The season was their last as Amica Wronki announced that they would merge with Lech Poznań to form a new team called KKS Lech Poznań for the 2006–2007 season. They played their last game in the Ekstraklasa on 13 May 2006 with a 2–1 win over GKS Bełchatów and finished in 4th place in the final league standings.

Amica would still function as a lower-league team for the 2006–07 season but the bulk of players and staff had either joined new clubs or transferred to Lech Poznań which represented the newly merged team in the Ekstraklasa. The roster consisted mostly of youth players; the oldest player in the new squad being 22 years old. This would have gave them an opportunity to showcase their talents before they are transferred either to Lech Poznań, who have the right of first refusal, or to other clubs.

Allegedly, one of the main reasons that the merger was finalised was the Amica company wanting to invest in a team with a larger fanbase. At the time, Wronki has a population of 12,000 while Poznań has over 578,900 inhabitants.. Another reason was that Lech Poznań were looking for a new sponsor to inject funds into the team and Amica fit the bill perfectly since they were so close. Both cities are in the Greater Poland province of Poland and are barely apart.

The 2006–07 season didn&#x27;t start well for the new-look Lech Poznań as they lost their chance to get into Europe, a benefit that Amica Wronki fought for last season by finishing fourth while Lech Poznań was placed sixth. They lost 4–1 on aggregate against Moldovan team FC Tiraspol in the UEFA Intertoto Cup and had to contend with a season without European football in Poznań.

The reserve team then became its first team but only lasted one season before it was finally disbanded. In 2007, one of the clubs that was merged that created Amica, Błękitni Wronki, was re-founded and is considered to be a phoenix club.

== Stadium ==

The Wronki Stadium is small and modern with undersoil heating. The ground holds just over 5,000 spectators – a third of the town&#x27;s population – and has floodlighting. The stadium staged three games during the 2006 UEFA U-19 European Championships held in Poland. The stadium is currently used by the Lech Poznań&#x27;s reserve team, whilst Błękitni Wronki Amica&#x27;s phoenix club play in Popów, hoping to return to their spiritual home in Wronki in the future.

== Fans ==
Amica and Błękitni fans have the same core group of supporters, as they see themselves as a continuation of one another, and therefore the rivalries are the same regardless which club the fans went to see throughout history.

As the club is from Greater Poland, as many smaller clubs in the region, the fans originally sympathised with the regional powerhouse Lech Poznań; however, Amica&#x27;s controversial absorption into (/merger with) Lech has caused bad blood.

Even before Amica&#x27;s existence, the fans from Wronki had a fierce rivalry with Sparta Szamotuły, with whom they contest the Szamotuły County Derby, however since 30 May 1976 when Sparta beat Błękitni 10–0 away from home the teams met only sporadically, since Amica went on to play in the Ekstraklasa. Since Amica&#x27;s disbandment and Błękitni&#x27;s re-founding the rivalry has been renewed in the lower leagues.

The club also developed a strong rivalry with Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski during the Amica years, but since Dyskobolia&#x27;s similar fate to that of Amica (taken over by Polonia Warsaw) both Błękitni and Dyskobolia have renewed their rivalry in the lower leagues.

In its heyday, when Amica played in continental competitions, their fans had good relations with Servette Geneva and a close friendship with fans of NEC Nijmegen after meeting them in a UEFA Cup game.

<text>The Western Qin (; 385–400, 409–431) was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Qifu clan of Xianbei ethnicity during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms. All rulers of the Western Qin declared themselves &quot;wang&quot;, translatable as either &quot;king&quot; or &quot;prince.&quot; They ruled an area corresponding to modern-day southwestern Gansu in Northwest China, also known as the Longxi region, along with parts of northeastern Qinghai in the later years. The state went by various different names as their rulers opted for lesser peerages while they were acting as vassals, and they were only known as &quot;Qin&quot; (秦) from 395 to 400, from 409 to 411 and from 414 to 431. 

The Western Qin was briefly discontinued in 400 after Qifu Gangui surrendered to the Later Qin before it was revived in 409. They also frequently shifted their capital from time to time, with Fuhan (枹罕, in modern Linxia, Gansu) as their longest-serving capital at 18 years without interruption. They are given the prefix of &quot;Western&quot; in historiography to distinguish them with the Former Qin and Later Qin as they were situated to the west of the two states.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Qifu tribe was a western branch of Xianbei that resettled around the Longxi region during the beginning of the Western Jin dynasty around 265. Their ancestor was Rufu (如弗), who led the Qifu and three other tribes, Siyin (斯引), Chulian (出連) and Chilu (叱盧) from the north of the Gobi Desert to move south to the Yin Mountains. It is believed that the Qifu had strong connections to the Gaoche people (also known as Dingling); the Chilu were also known as the Tulu (吐盧), one of the twelves surnames of the Gaoche, and during the Western Qin period, there were several officials who had the Dingling surnames of Zhai (翟), Wuyin (屋引), Yizhan (乙旃) and Chilu. The name &quot;Qifu&quot; (乞伏) may have even come from the Gaoche surname, &quot;Qifuli&quot; (泣伏利).

The Qifu and their followers eventually left the Yin Mountains to live north of the Hetao region. Under Qifu Youlin, they initially moved westward to an area known as Xiayuan (夏緣) and later settled along the Gaoping River (高平川; in modern Guyuan, Ningxia), where they annexed the Xianbei Lujie (鹿結) tribe who had a following of 70,000 people. The Qifu continued to live a nomadic lifestyle within the Chinese interior, frequently shifting their base before finally settling at Mount Dujian (度堅山; in modern Jingyuan County, Gansu) under Qifu Sifan. In 371, Sifan submitted to the Di-led Former Qin dynasty, and he was given control over the Yongshi River (勇士川; in modern Lanzhou, Gansu) after helping them defeat a Xianbei revolt in 373.

After Sifan died in 376, his son, Qifu Guoren succeeded him. In 383, Guoren was meant to serve in Former Qin’s campaign against the Eastern Jin, but when his uncle, Qifu Butui (乞伏步頹) rebelled in the Longxi, he was sent to quell the rebellion instead. However, believing that Qin’s fall was eminent, Guoren joined Butui and declared his intention of creating his own state. Surely enough, Qin suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Fei River later that year, sending the state into a rapid decline. Guoren then mustered the local tribes and raised an army of around 100,000.

=== Early rule ===
After the Former Qin ruler, Fu Jian was killed in 385, Guoren claimed the title of Grand Chanyu, introduced a new reign era and built his capital city around Yongshi. This is often seen as the beginning of the Western Qin dynasty, but at this point, the Qifu had not yet named their state &quot;Qin&quot;, and in 387, they became a vassal to Former Qin after Guoren accepted their title of Prince of Yuanchuan. Guoren spent his reign subjugating neighbouring tribes before dying in 388. As Guoren&#x27;s son, Qifu Gongfu (乞伏公府), was too young, his brother, Qifu Gangui was acclaimed the new leader. 

After ascending, Gangui shifted his capital to Jincheng (金城; in modern Yuzhong County, Gansu). He expanded his power by continuing to campaign against the tribes and receiving tributes from the Tuyuhun, but in 391, he first came into conflict with the Later Liang in the Hexi. In 394, Former Qin was decisively defeated by the Later Qin, and their ruler, Fu Deng was captured in battle. Although his son, Fu Chong succeeded him, Gangui took the opportunity to seize Former Qin&#x27;s remaining territory. The Qifu occupied the whole of Longxi after killing Fu Chong and the Chouchi ruler, Yang Ding in battle, bringing a formal end to Former Qin.

In 395, Gangui claimed the title of King of Qin. Historiographers refer to his state as the Western Qin to distinguish it with the Former Qin and Later Qin. While he still kept the Grand Chanyu title and its auxiliary offices, he established a governmental structure that was similar to the Eastern Han and Cao Wei dynasties. Conflict with the Later Liang continued, which led to Gangui moving the capital to Xicheng (西城, in modern Baiyin, Gansu) and briefly submitting to Liang. The threat dissipated after Western Qin repelled a Later Liang invasion in 397, leading to rebellions in Liang by the Tufa and Juqu tribes, who founded the Southern Liang and Northern Liang respectively.

In 400, Gangui moved the capital to Yuanchuan (苑川, in modern Baiyin, Gansu), but shortly after, he faced a major invasion from Later Qin. He was heavily defeated and so decided to surrender to Southern Liang, ending Western Qin for a time. However, he later fled to Later Qin, where he was made a general and allowed him to hold his former territory.

=== Restoration and final defeat ===

By 409, the Later Qin was facing mounting defeats on the battlefield along with the Helian Xia and Southern Liang breaking away. That year, Qifu Gangui restored the Western Qin at Mount Dujian, once again calling himself the King of Qin. He soon returned the capital to Yuanchuan in 410 and captured several Later Qin commanderies. Due to pressure from the Xia and Eastern Jin, Later Qin could only convince Gangui to remain as a nominal vassal by appointing him the King of Henan. Gangui then campaigned against Southern Liang and the Tuyuhun. In 412, he shifted the capital to Tanjiao (譚郊, in modern Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu) before he was assassinated by Qifu Gongfu.

Gangui&#x27;s son, Qifu Chipan quickly defeated Gongfu and took the throne. Chipan moved the capital to Fuhan (枹罕, in modern Linxia, Gansu), where it would remain for many years. Evident from his reign was the Western Qin&#x27;s endorsement of Buddhism, as the Bingling Temple was first built under him. In 414, he conquered the Southern Liang and restored the King of Qin title, but Western Qin was now in contact with Northern Liang, and the two sides fought with each other on multiple occasions. He also launched several campaigns against the Tuyuhun and other tribes to broaden his state&#x27;s influence. When the Eastern Jin commander, Liu Yu conquered Later Qin in 417, Chipan submitted to Jin as a vassal. Liu Yu appointed him Duke of Henan and left his territory unscathed, but in 418, the Helian Xia conquered the Guanzhong region from Jin, and Western Qin had a new threat from the east.

The situation worsened for Western Qin in 421 as the Northern Liang vanquished the Western Liang, freeing up their western frontiers and allowing them to focus on Qin. Chipan allied himself with the Northern Wei and tried to get them to attack the Xia, but he continued to suffer losses to Xia and Liang, with his worst defeat coming in 426. Internally, Western Qin was also struggling with rebellions by their Tuyuhun and Qiang subjects. Chipan died in 428, leaving behind his son and successor, Qifu Mumo an inherently dire situation.

In 429, due to pressure from Liang, Mumo was forced to move his capital to Dinglian (定連; in modern Linxia, Gansu). In 430, Mumo offered his surrender to Northern Wei, but on his way to join Wei at Shanggui, the Xia emperor, Helian Ding intercepted him and forced him to stop at Nan&#x27;an (南安; southeast of modern Longxi County, Gansu). Meanwhile, the rest of Qin&#x27;s territory was conquered by the Tuyuhun, leaving Mumo with only a lone city. In 431, Helian Ding, in a last-ditch effort to expand westward, attacked Nan&#x27;an and forced Mumo to surrender, thus ending the Western Qin dynasty. Mumo and 500 of his clan members were all executed by Xia.

==Language==
Shimunek classifies the language of the Qifu as a &quot;Serbi&quot; (i.e., para-Mongolic) language. Shimunek&#x27;s &quot;Serbi&quot; linguistic branch also includes Taghbach, Tuyuhun, and Khitan.

<text>The Leasowes is a 57-hectare (around 141 acre) estate in Halesowen, historically in the county of Shropshire, later (from 1844) Worcestershire, England, comprising house and gardens. The parkland is now listed Grade I on English Heritage&#x27;s Register of Parks and Gardens and the home of the Halesowen Golf Club. The name means &quot;rough pasture land&quot;.

== Shenstone (1743 to 1763) ==

Developed between 1743 and 1763 by poet William Shenstone as a &quot;ferme ornée&quot;, the garden is one of the most admired early examples of the English garden. Its importance lies in its simplicity and the uncompromisingly rural appearance. Thomas Whately praises it in chapter LII of his &quot;Observations on Modern Gardening&quot; of 1770:

== Horne (1763 to 1789) ==

Shenstone died in 1763. The house and grounds were purchased by Edward Horne, who demolished Shenstone&#x27;s house and built a new one on the same site completing it around 1776. He also built a walled garden and a hothouse.

=== Visit of Adams and Jefferson ===
With Whately&#x27;s treatise guiding him every step of the way, in April 1786, polymath Thomas Jefferson, the future third President of the United States, visited the Leasowes (then owned by Edward Horne) on his tour of English gardens in the company of his close friend and future second President of the US, John Adams.

Adams wrote in his diary:

Jefferson&#x27;s more purposeful and inquisitive account in his &quot;Notes of a Tour of English Gardens&quot; delivers some additional background:

== Later ownership and developments ==

In 1789 Edward Horne sold the property to Major Francis Halliday who made considerable additions to the house and parkland. He added a stone portico at the entrance of the house and a folly hermitage in the high wood, which was decorated with &quot;stained glass windows, furnace cinders, cowheel bones, horses&#x27; teeth, etc.&quot; (this was not in keeping with Shenstone&#x27;s park improvements).

Halliday died in 1794, at the age of 45. In June 1795, Edward Butler Hartopp became the owner of the estate, and held possession till July 1800, when it was transferred to Charles Hamilton, and when he became insolvent in 1807, it passed into the hands of Matthias Attwood, who unlike the previous owners did not take any action to preserve William Shenstone&#x27;s park features, and by the 1820s the park grounds had sunk into a &quot;state of ruin and desolation&quot;. An extended description of the landscapes of Hagley Park and of the Leasowes in 1845, with reflections on Shenstone, is given by the Scottish geologist Hugh Miller.
The house, despite being not architecturally outstanding, is Grade I listed in view of its association with Shenstone and its importance in the history of landscape gardening. Between 1897 and 1907, it housed the Anstey College of Physical Education. Part of the site was purchased by the Halesowen Golf Club in 1906. Halesowen Council (later to become Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council) purchased The Leasowes in 1934 and since then the site has been managed as a public park with part of the site leased to Halesowen Golf Club. Neglected since Shenstone&#x27;s death, restoration of the 18th century landscape began in May 2008 and was completed by January 2009 (several months ahead of schedule). The restoration included the creation of a linear lake in the disused Lapal canal which runs across an earth filled embankbent 60 feet above Breaches pool to the south of the park.

<doc id="677558" wikidata="Q311511" url="?curid=677558" title="Mário Zagallo">
<text>Mário Jorge Lobo Zagallo (; 9 August 1931 – 5 January 2024) was a Brazilian professional football player, coordinator and manager, who played as a forward.

Zagallo holds the record for World Cup titles in general with four titles in total. He also holds the record for World Cup finals with six participations. He was the first person to win the FIFA World Cup as both a manager and as a player, winning the competition in 1958 and 1962 as a player and in 1970 as manager. In addition, he won the 1994 FIFA World Cup as assistant manager. Zagallo also coached Brazil in 1974 (finishing fourth) and in 1998 (finishing as runners-up) and was a technical assistant in 2006. He was the first of three men, along with Germany&#x27;s Franz Beckenbauer (who coincidentally died two days after Zagallo) and France&#x27;s Didier Deschamps to have won the World Cup as a player and as a manager, and the only one who had done each more than once.

In 1992, Zagallo received the FIFA Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded by FIFA, for his contributions to football. He was named the 9th Greatest Manager of All Time by World Soccer Magazine in 2013. On 5 January 2024, Zagallo died at the age of 92. He was the last surviving Brazilian player who participated in the 1958 World Cup final.

== Early life ==
Mário Jorge Lobo Zagallo was born in Atalaia, on the coast of central Brazil, on August 9, 1931. He later moved to Rio de Janeiro with his family when he was still eight months old. As a young man, he committed to complete his military service in the Brazilian Army; he was notably deployed at the Maracanã Stadium when Uruguay defeated Brazil in the 1950 World Cup decisive match.

==Playing career==
Zagallo started his football career in the youth sector of América, before joining Flamengo in 1950; having turned professional and established himself within the &quot;Mengão&quot;&#x27;s first team, he helped the club win three consecutive titles in the Campeonato Carioca between 1953 and 1955.

In 1958, Zagallo joined Botafogo, and eventually became a part of a team that included several other regular starters of the Brazilian national team, such as Garrincha, Nilton Santos and Didi. He went on to help the side win two titles in the Torneio Rio–São Paulo, as well as two in the Campeonato Carioca, and represented &quot;O Fogo&quot; until his retirement in 1965.

Zagallo won a total of 33 caps for the Brazil senior national team between 1958 and 1964, scoring five goals.

In 1958, he was included by manager Vicente Feola in the Brazilian squad for the FIFA World Cup in Sweden: following an injury to Pepe, he was promoted to the starting XI, and eventually scored a goal in the final as Brazil claimed their first world title.

He was also a part of the squad that won the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, where he started in all of Brazil&#x27;s matches.

==Style of play==

=== Player ===
Zagallo was a diminutive left winger with a small physique, who was known for his technical skills and his high defensive work-rate, as well as his ability to make attacking runs from deeper areas of the pitch. He was also capable of playing as a forward, either as a main striker, or as an inside forward.

Due to his characteristics and his skills, he received the nickname &quot;Formiguinha&quot; (&quot;Little Ant&quot; in Portuguese).

=== Manager ===
During his stint as Brazil&#x27;s head coach, Zagallo mainly adopted a 4-2-3-1 formation; he was considered to be one of the first managers to focus on the physical preparation of his players before long-lasting tournaments, including the 1970 FIFA World Cup.

He was nicknamed &quot;The Professor&quot; by his players throughout his coaching career, due to his tactical awareness and commanding presence on the bench, as well as &quot;Velho Lobo&quot; (&quot;Old Wolf&quot;) due to his surname &quot;Lobo&quot;, which means &quot;wolf&quot; in Portuguese.

==Managerial career==

In 1966, Zagallo started his managerial career at Botafogo, the club he had finished his playing career with. He was then appointed as the manager of the Brazil national team shortly before the start of the 1970 FIFA World Cup, and eventually led the &quot;Seleção&quot; to their third title. In the process, he became the first person to win the World Cup both as a player and as a manager; at the age of 38, he also became the second youngest coach to win the aforementioned title, behind only Alberto Suppici.

At the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany, Zagallo was disadvantaged by the international retirement of Pelé four years earlier, as well as injuries to Tostão and Carlos Alberto Torres, meaning that only two starting players from the 1970 final were in the squad. Additionally, the team had a lack of competitive practice due to the shelving of the Copa América between 1967 and 1975. In response to Brazil being eliminated by overly physical European sides in 1954 and 1966, Zagallo chose to play in an equally aggressive way. Brazil narrowly made it through the first group stage by one goal in goal difference over Scotland, and missed out on the final after a 2–0 loss to the Netherlands, in which Luís Pereira was sent off for a foul on Johan Neeskens. Poland then defeated Brazil in the third-place playoff.

In 1989, Zagallo was hired by the United Arab Emirates for their qualification campaign for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He led the amateurs to an unexpected first qualification to the tournament, but left for Vasco da Gama days before the World Cup began and was replaced by Carlos Alberto Parreira.

He then returned to the Brazilian national team as a coordinator and assistant coach, and helped the side win the 1994 FIFA World Cup while serving in those roles.

Once again, he was given to manage the Brazilian national team for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Brazil reached the final but due to Ronaldo&#x27;s sudden injury, they lost to the host nation France 3–0.

In November 2002, Zagallo came out of retirement to coach Brazil again, following Luiz Felipe Scolari&#x27;s exit after winning that year&#x27;s World Cup. On 20 November, in his only game, the team won 3–2 in a friendly away to South Korea.

==Personal life==

Zagallo married Alcina de Castro on 13 January 1955 at the Church of Capuchins in Rio de Janeiro. They remained together until de Castro&#x27;s death on 5 November 2012. Mário and Alcina had four children. He was a practicing Catholic.

Zagallo&#x27;s surname was spelled Zagalo for most of his career, including by himself, until he told a reporter in the 1990s that his surname on his birth certificate was Zagallo. He was also the only Brazilian World Cup-winning forward to be known by his surname. He was of Lebanese descent.

In July 2022, Zagallo was admitted to hospital with a respiratory infection. In August 2023, he was hospitalized for 22 days due to a urinary infection. Following a brief hospitalization in Rio de Janeiro, he died on 5 January 2024 due to multiple organ failure, resulting from the exacerbation of various pre-existing comorbidities. Zagallo was aged 92.

<text>Odra Wodzisław Śląski (), is a Polish football club based in Wodzisław Śląski, Poland. 

The club played in the top flight between 1996 and 2010, appearing in the Intertoto Cup thrice and UEFA Cup once 
They currently compete in the IV liga Silesia, the fifth level of the national football league system.

==History==
The club was established in 1922 as Odra Wodzisław, then changed its name several times. After World War II, and until 1963, the club was linked closely to the Polish State Railways (PKP), so the club bore the nickname &quot;Kolejarz&quot;, which means The Railwaymen. From 1963 until 1974, the club took the name &quot;Górnik&quot; (miner), as the club is based in Upper Silesia, known for its coal-mining industry. Then, the club reverted to its traditional name, Odra, after the Oder River).

After several decades in the second and third tiers of the league system, Odra were promoted to the Polish Ekstraklasa for the first time in 1996. The team continued to develop over the following years, achieving 3rd place in their first season at this level before settling into mid-table placings over the following decade. From 2007, however, league positions worsened until the club was finally relegated to the I liga in 2010. In spite of this, Odra did manage to reach the final of the Ekstraklasa Cup in 2009, losing to regional rivals Śląsk Wrocław. During the 2010–11 season, Odra underwent severe financial difficulties, often struggling to raise enough money to travel to away fixtures. This affected on-field performance and a second successive relegation followed. The summer of 2011 saw the Odra board declare themselves bankrupt and dissolve the club, with fans reforming as &quot;Klub Piłkarski Odra 1922 Wodzisław&quot;. This new club joined the lowest rung of the Polish league ladder for the 2011–12 season.

==Stadium==
Odra hosts their games at a multi-purpose MOSiR Stadium, with a capacity of 7,400 people.

<text>Górnik Zabrze [[Spółka Akcyjna]], commonly referred to as Górnik Zabrze S.A. or simply Górnik Zabrze (), is a Polish football club from Zabrze. Górnik is one of the most successful Polish football clubs in history, winning the second-most Polish Championship titles together with Ruch Chorzów. The club was a dominant force in the 1960s and 1980s. Górnik holds the record for winning the most consecutive Polish Championship titles (5) and Polish Cup titles (5). In addition, the club was 1969–70 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup runners-up.

They currently compete in the Ekstraklasa, the top tier of the national football league system. The club plays in a white or dark blue-red kit, and is based at the Arena Zabrze. Their main local rival is Ruch Chorzów. 

== History ==

=== First years ===
The club was founded in 1948 after several smaller sports associations – KS Zjednoczenie, KS Pogoń, KS Skra, and KS Concordia – were merged into a single organization, which took the name &quot;Górnik&quot;, the Polish word for &quot;Miner&quot;, reflecting the fact that Zabrze was an important coal-mining centre.

In 1950 Górnik joined the Opole Silesia regional league. In 1952 the club was promoted to the Polish Second Division. Their first game in the second tier was against Skra Częstochowa, and was witnessed by 20,000 fans, with Górnik winning 5–1. The whole season was very successful and Górnik finished second overall, behind Górnik Wałbrzych.

The club was promoted to the top division in 1955. In their first game in the top flight Górnik beat local rivals Ruch Chorzów 3–1, with 25,000 in attendance; the club finished the season in sixth place.

=== First successes ===
In 1957, just a year after promotion, Górnik won its first championship of Poland. The team, with star, Ernest Pohl, was third in 1958, to regain the crown in 1959 and 1961, together with such players as Stanisław Oślizło and Hubert Kostka. In 1961 Górnik for the first time appeared in European Cups, losing in the first round to Tottenham Hotspur.

=== Golden years ===

The next championship, won in 1963, marked the beginning of an unusual streak of five consecutive titles (1963, 64, 65, 66 and 67), which is a Polish record.

Górnik&#x27;s biggest success in European football took place in 1970 (even though in Poland the team was second, after Legia Warsaw). In the UEFA Cup Winners Cup, Gornik beat all their opponents – Olympiacos, Rangers, Levski Sofia and AS Roma, reaching the final, which took place in Vienna. There, Manchester City turned out to be the better team, winning 2–1. The following season Górnik would once again play Manchester City, with the 1970 final being repeated this time in the quarter-final.

=== Late 1970s and early 1980s ===
During the mid-1970s Górnik form deteriorated and in late spring of 1978, the team was relegated to the Second Division. However, it returned after one year and in games of 1979–80, Zabrze&#x27;s side finished sixth. In 1984, after purchasing of a group of talented players (Ryszard Komornicki, Waldemar Matysik, Eugeniusz Cebrat, Andrzej Zgutczyński, Tadeusz Dolny, Andrzej Pałasz), Górnik finished fourth, which was a sign of better times.

=== Late 1980s until now ===
Between 1985 and 1988 Górnik again marked a magnificent streak, with four consecutive championships. Zabrze&#x27;s side also played versus renowned European powerhouses, such as Bayern Munich, Anderlecht, Hamburger SV, Juventus and Real Madrid.

In 1994 Górnik competed again for the title and with players as Jerzy Brzęczek, Grzegorz Mielcarski, Tomasz Wałdoch, hopes were high. Before the last round of the league the standings at the top were: Legia 47 points and Górnik 45 points. Since the two teams were to face each other in Warsaw, Górnik still had a chance to win the title. However the game ended in a 1–1 tie which gave Legia the crown. Before Legia scored the goal which gave her the title (the score 0–1 would mean the title for Górnik), the referee of the match – Mr Redzinski – sent off one by one 3 players from Górnik&#x27;s squad, and Górnik had to finished match with only 8 players against 11 players of Legia. It was the last match in Mr Redzinski&#x27;s career.

In the same year, Górnik played its last so far game in European Cups, losing to Admira Wacker Vienna.

In the spring of 2007 Górnik got a new sponsor – German insurance company Allianz. However, after finishing 16th in the Ekstraklasa in 2008–09, the club was relegated to the Polish First League, the second level of Polish football, during the 2009–10 season. In June 2010, the club earned promotion back to the Ekstraklasa for the 2010–11 season. Since then, Górnik has promoted a number of players to the Poland national team and transferred several players to stronger leagues, including Arkadiusz Milik, Łukasz Skorupski, Szymon Żurkowski and Paweł Bochniewicz.

<text>Endicott Howard Peabody (February 15, 1920 – December 2, 1997) was an American politician from Massachusetts. A Democrat, he served a single two-year term as the 62nd Governor of Massachusetts, from 1963 to 1965. His tenure is probably best known for his categorical opposition to the death penalty and for signing into law the bill establishing the University of Massachusetts Boston. After losing the 1964 Democratic gubernatorial primary, Peabody made several more failed bids for office in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, including failed campaigns for the U.S. Senate in 1966 and 1986.

Born in Lawrence, Massachusetts to a family with deep colonial roots, Peabody played college football at Harvard University, where he earned honors as an All-American lineman. He served in the United States Navy in World War II before embarking on a political career noted more for its failures than its successes. He made multiple unsuccessful attempts to win the position of Massachusetts Attorney General, and for the United States Senate representing both Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and ran for United States Vice President in 1972.

==Early life==
Endicott Peabody, nicknamed &quot;Chub&quot;, was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the son of Mary Elizabeth (née Parkman) and the Reverend Malcolm E. Peabody, an Episcopal Bishop of Central New York. He was a grandson of the founder of Groton School and Brooks School, also named Endicott Peabody, and was a descendant of colonial governor John Endecott. His maternal grandfather, Henry Parkman, was a Boston businessman and politician.

Peabody first attended the William Penn Charter School, and graduated in 1938 from the Groton School. He earned his A.B. from Harvard College in 1942, majoring in history. Peabody played on the Harvard Crimson football team and also played ice hockey and tennis. He stood out in football, where he was known as the &quot;baby-faced assassin&quot;, playing three seasons on the varsity squad, and was the only unanimous choice for the 1941 College Football All-America Team. He was awarded the Knute Rockne Memorial Trophy for best collegiate lineman in 1941, and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973.

Peabody served in the United States Navy during World War II, primarily as a Lieutenant aboard the USS &quot;Tirante&quot; in the Pacific Ocean theater. He led several boarding parties involving hand-to-hand combat, for which he was awarded several commendations including the Silver Star.

==Early forays into politics==
While serving in the war, Peabody decided to embark on a career in politics. After the war ended, he attended Harvard Law School, receiving his J.D. degree and attaining admission to the Massachusetts bar in 1948. His first political work was on the 1948 presidential campaign of Harry S. Truman. Truman appointed him an Assistant Regional Counsel for the Office of Price Stabilization in 1950 and Regional Counsel for the Small Defense Plants Administration in 1952. In 1954 he won election to the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council, serving one two-year term.
In 1958, Peabody ran for Attorney General of Massachusetts, but lost in the Democratic primary to Edward McCormack, Jr. by nine percentage points. In 1960, he ran for Governor of Massachusetts, but came in second (out of seven candidates) in the Democratic primary with 25.5% of the vote. In that year&#x27;s presidential election, he coordinated John F. Kennedy&#x27;s campaigns in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire.

==Governorship==

In the 1962 gubernatorial election, Peabody was victorious in the race for governor, upsetting the Republican incumbent John A. Volpe by only 4,431 votes out of over two million cast. Peabody&#x27;s campaign manager was his law partner Joseph M. Koufman. Peabody was aided in the victory by endorsements from President Kennedy, and the landslide victory of Kennedy&#x27;s brother Edward in the coinciding race for the president&#x27;s former United States Senate seat.

During his administration, voters approved a state constitutional amendment extending the terms of office of all state constitutional officers from two years to four years, starting from the next election. Peabody advocated laws to prevent discrimination in housing and to establish drug addiction treatment programs. He also strongly opposed capital punishment and &quot;vowed that he would not sign a death warrant even for the Boston Strangler, if he were ever caught and convicted.&quot; This position was controversial, especially because several police officers were killed in the line of duty in the state during his tenure. Peabody recommended the commutation of every death sentence that he reviewed while governor. Massachusetts&#x27; last executions took place in 1947, though the penalty itself remained in force. On June 18, 1964, Peabody signed into law the bill establishing the University of Massachusetts Boston.

On April 1, 1964, the governor&#x27;s 72-year-old mother, Mary Parkman Peabody, made headlines when she was arrested at the Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge in St. Augustine, Florida, for attempting to be served in an integrated group at a racially segregated restaurant. The action made her a hero to the civil rights movement and brought civil rights efforts in St. Augustine, the nation&#x27;s oldest city, to national and international attention.

In 1964, Lt. Gov. Francis X. Bellotti mounted a primary campaign against Peabody for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Although Peabody was supported by Senator Kennedy and the party convention, Bellotti was victorious in the primary. Peabody&#x27;s loss was variously attributed to his controversial opposition to the death penalty, his stiff demeanor in television appearances, and a bruising defeat he suffered early in his term in opposing the winning candidate for Speaker of the Massachusetts General Court. Bellotti subsequently lost the general election to John Volpe.

==Post-governorship==
===Senate campaign===
In 1966, Peabody ran for the U.S. Senate, for which there was an open seat that year as a result of the retirement of Leverett Saltonstall; he won the Democratic nomination but was defeated by a landslide in the general election by the Republican nominee, the liberal state Attorney General Edward Brooke.

===1972 vice presidential election===
Peabody undertook a quixotic campaign for Vice President of the United States on the Democratic ticket in 1972; he came in fourth in the balloting at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. He ran under the slogan &quot;Endicott Peabody, the number one man for the number two job.&quot;

===New Hampshire===
In 1983, he moved to Hollis, New Hampshire, where he ran unsuccessfully for local and statewide political office several times, including for the U.S. Senate in 1986 against the Republican incumbent, Warren Rudman.

In 1992, Peabody ran again for vice president by competing in the New Hampshire vice-presidential primary, where he won with 59.7% of the vote. However, the primary is non-binding, and, at the prerogative of the presidential nominee, Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the vice-presidential nomination eventually went to Al Gore of Tennessee. Clinton and Gore subsequently won the general election.

Also in 1992, Peabody ran for a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, but he came in third place with 20.7% of the vote.

Peabody died from leukemia in Hollis in 1997, aged 77. His remains were interred in Groton, Massachusetts.

==Family==
On June 24, 1944, Peabody married Barbara Welch &quot;Toni&quot; Gibbons (1922–2012), a native of Bermuda, the elder daughter of Morris Gibbons, a member of the Parliament of Bermuda, and his wife, the former Maude Madge Welch. Peabody and his wife had a daughter, Barbara, and two sons, Robert and Endicott Jr.

Peabody&#x27;s sister, Marietta Peabody Tree, represented the United States on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.

<doc id="677583" wikidata="Q4930622" url="?curid=677583" title="Blue–Gray Football Classic">
<text>The Blue–Gray Football Classic was an annual American college football all-star game held in Alabama, usually in late December and often on Christmas Day. The brainchild of Alabama college football legend Champ Pickens, the contest began in 1939 and was held annually through 2001, with the exception of 1943 due to World War II. 

All of the games, except for the final contest, were played at the Cramton Bowl in Montgomery, Alabama, under the auspices of the Montgomery Lions Club. The game was not contested in 2002, then was revived briefly in 2003 at Movie Gallery Stadium in Troy, Alabama. Lacking a major television sponsor, the game was discontinued thereafter.

==History==
The format pitted players who attended college in the states of the former Confederacy, the &quot;Grays&quot;, who wore white jerseys, against players who attended school in the northern half of the country, the &quot;Blues&quot;, who wore blue jerseys, and also sometimes including players from western teams. Both teams wore gray pants. Only seniors played in this game, because it was their first venture into professional football, as they were paid for their participation.

The game was almost always the first major college all-star game of the year. For this reason, it was difficult to get some of the collegiate stars, because many of them were preparing at the same time for bowl games with their regular teams. Also, many potential players preferred to spend Christmas at home. In the game&#x27;s later years, most of the players came from teams with losing records and from smaller schools which do not play NCAA Division I football. The Classic gave these players an opportunity to be noticed by NFL scouts and others who may not have had the opportunity to observe them previously. Most such players now attend the NFL Combine for evaluation.

The game was slow to desegregate. In 1963, NBC, which had televised the game for much of its run, dropped it from the schedule when the Lions Club refused to integrate it. The game desegregated in 1965, which in turn convinced CBS to carry a telecast. From then on, the Classic showcased many African American stars from smaller, lesser-known schools (including many historically black colleges and universities). Jerry Rice played in the 1984 game and was named the Most Valuable Player. 

However, civil rights leaders complained that forcing African-American players from southern colleges and universities to represent the former Confederacy was both insensitive and offensive. Also in the late 1960s, as a result of growing public dissension over the Vietnam War, peace activists decried the contest as glorifying war and militarism. A large sit-in for peace was staged before the 1969 game that effectively blocked the gates at the stadium which resulted in protesters being forcibly removed, brutally beaten and arrested by the police. The start of the game was delayed for over an hour, and only part of the game was televised. For the next three years, troops of the Alabama National Guard were deployed to the stadium to keep order, on the orders of Governor George Wallace. 

The Classic also made many concessions to make it more television-friendly. In 1975, Mizlou Television Network, which carried the game that year, cut three minutes off the game clock by shortening the first quarter to 12 minutes long. The Classic&#x27;s committee, angered by the change (and an accusation that the clock had been slowed to allow a game-winning rally), asserted control over the game clock for future games so that such an incident could not happen again. The game also used a &quot;rally rule&quot;: after either team scored (by way of safety, touchdown, field goal, or returning blocked PAT attempts), if one of the two teams was losing by ten or more points, they would receive the kickoff, in order to keep the game close and prevent the loss of viewership which often occurs in lopsided games. From 1979 onward (and occasionally before that), the game was played on Christmas Day, which may have tended to limit the live attendance, but ensured it was on television at a time when potential viewership was great.

The game was not played in 2002 after longtime sponsor Kelly Springfield Tire (a subsidiary of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company), under pressure by civil rights leaders who threatened a boycott, decided to discontinue its sponsorship, and the Lions Club was unable to find a new sponsor in time. However, it was unlikely in any event the game would have been played that year due to the poor condition of the Cramton Bowl: the stadium, built in 1923, had not been well maintained over the years, and by this time it was literally crumbling. 

The Lions Club was instrumental in reviving the game at Troy University&#x27;s Movie Gallery Stadium (now Veterans Memorial Stadium), 50 miles south of Montgomery. It was generally thought that the Lions Club and others would have liked to return the game to Montgomery, but opted not to do so because it was unable to find a suitable replacement venue in the Montgomery area.

The Cramton Bowl was ultimately renovated in 2011; new ASU Stadium was also constructed at the same time. In December 2014, the Cramton Bowl began hosting the Camellia Bowl—the 2020 edition was held on Christmas Day, returning college football to the venue on the holiday for the first time in 19 years.

==Game results==
64 Blue–Gray Football Classics were played: Gray winning 33 games, Blue winning 29 games, and two games being tied. All were played in Montgomery, Alabama, except the 2003 game, played in Troy, Alabama.

<text>Górniczy Klub Sportowy Górnik Łęczna (), commonly referred to as Górnik Łęczna, is a sports club based in Łęczna, Poland. It is best known for its men&#x27;s professional football team, which competes in I liga, the second division in the Polish football league system. The club also fields teams in women&#x27;s football and wrestling.

==History==
The club was founded in 1979, as a club for the local coal miners. As the years went, the local Bogdanka Coal Mine decided to invest more and more money and as a result the club quickly rose through the leagues. The club shed its relative obscurity when it gained promotion to the Ekstraklasa in 2003.

Górnik Łęczna played in the top division from 2003 until 2007, when they were relegated to the 3rd division, as a consequence of their involvement in a match fixing scandal. However they were promoted straight back up as league winners after the 2007–08 season and competed in the I Liga for six years before winning promotion to the 2014–15 Ekstraklasa.

Since 1 January 2007, the men&#x27;s football department has been operating as a business entity separate from the rest of the club.
In February 2011, the team was renamed GKS Bogdanka () for sponsorship reasons, a decision from the local Bogdanka coal mine. As a result, a group of supporters opposing the name change formed an amateur team GKS Górnik 1979 Łęczna. On 23 July 2013, GKS Bogdanka&#x27;s board of directors announced the return to the former name.

==GKS Górnik 1979 Łęczna==

Górnik 1979 Łęczna was a club founded in 2011 by Górnik Łęczna fans who were unhappy with the name change to GKS Bogdanka. The club eventually changed its name back in 2013 but the fan owned counterpart has continued to operate in amateur football leagues. On 22 August 2014 the club withdrew from all competitions and ceased to operate, the reason cited were the lack of funds and the fact that the original Górnik Łęczna team went back to its original name scrapping the GKS Bogdanka name.

==Women&#x27;s section==

The women&#x27;s section of Górnik Łęczna played for years in the second and third-tier leagues of Poland. In 2006–07 the team reached the semi-finals of the Polish Cup but lost to Medyk Konin. In the 2009–10 season with the expansion of the Ekstraliga Kobiet the team finally gained promotion to it by finishing second in its 2nd tier division. In its Ekstraliga debut Górnik was 5th.

<doc id="677590" wikidata="Q620875" url="?curid=677590" title="Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company">
<text>The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is an American multinational tire manufacturer headquartered in Akron, Ohio. Goodyear manufactures tires for passenger vehicles, aviation, commercial trucks, military and police vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, race cars, and heavy off-road machinery. It also licenses the Goodyear brand to bicycle tire manufacturers, returning from a break in production between 1976 and 2015. As of 2017, Goodyear is one of the top four tire manufacturers along with Bridgestone (Japan), Michelin (France), and Continental (Germany).

Founded in 1898 by Frank Seiberling, the company was named after American Charles Goodyear (1800–1860), inventor of vulcanized rubber. The first Goodyear tires became popular because they were easily detachable and required little maintenance. Though Goodyear had been manufacturing airships and balloons since the early 1900s, the first Goodyear advertising blimp flew in 1925. Today, it is one of the most recognizable advertising icons in America.

The company is the sole tire supplier for NASCAR series and the most successful tire supplier in Formula One history, with more starts, wins, and constructors&#x27; championships than any other tire supplier. They pulled out of the sport after the 1998 season. Goodyear was the first global tire manufacturer to enter China when it invested in a tire manufacturing plant in Dalian in 1994. Goodyear was a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average between 1930 and 1999. The company opened a new global headquarters building in Akron in 2013.

==History==

===Early history 1898–1926===
The first Goodyear factory opened in Akron, Ohio, in 1898. The company originally manufactured bicycle and carriage tires, rubber horseshoe pads, and poker chips, and grew with the advent of the automobile.

In 1901, Goodyear founder Frank Seiberling provided Henry Ford with racing tires. In 1903, Goodyear president, chairman and CEO Paul Weeks Litchfield was granted a patent for the first tubeless automobile tire. In 1910, the company purchased an existing rubber factory in Bowmanville, Ontario, in Canada, which expanded their manufacturing outside of the United States for the first time.

In 1916, Litchfield found land in the Phoenix area suitable for growing long-staple cotton, which was needed to reinforce its rubber in tires. The 36,000 acres purchased were controlled by the Southwest Cotton Company, formed with Litchfield as president. (This included land that would develop into the towns of Goodyear and Litchfield Park.)

In 1924, Litchfield forged a joint venture with the German Luftschiffbau Zeppelin Company to form the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation. From the late 1920s to 1940, the company worked with Goodyear to build two Zeppelins in the United States. The partnership continued even when Zeppelin was under Nazi control and only ended after World War II began.

===Expansion 1926–1970===

On August 5, 1927, Goodyear had its initial public offering and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

By 1930, Goodyear had pioneered what would later become known as &quot;tundra tires&quot; for smaller aircraft—their so-called low inflation pressure &quot;airwheel&quot; aviation wheel-rim/tire sets were initially available in sizes up to 46 inches (117 cm) in diameter.

Over the next few decades, Goodyear grew to become a multinational corporation. It acquired their rival Kelly-Springfield Tire in 1935. During World War II Goodyear manufactured F4U Corsair fighter planes for the U.S. Military. Goodyear ranked 30th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. WWII forced the dissolution of the Goodyear-Zeppelin partnership in December 1940. By 1956 they owned and operated a nuclear processing plant in Ohio.

In 1944, Goodyear created a subsidiary in Mexico in a joint venture with Compañía Hulera, S.A. de C.V., Compañía Hulera Goodyear-Oxo, S.A. de C.V. or Goodyear-Oxo.

===Radial tire transition===
Goodyear is the only one of the five biggest tire firms among US tire manufacturers in 1970 to remain independent into the 21st century. Goodyear&#x27;s success was partly due to the challenge posed by radial tire technology, and the varied responses. At the time, the entire US tire industry produced the older bias-ply technology. Estimates to fit factories with new machinery and tools for making the new product were between $600 million and $900 million. This was a substantial amount in a low margin business with sales revenue in the low billions. The US market was slowly shifting towards the radial tire, as had already been the case in Europe and Asia. In 1968, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of radial construction, which had been developed in 1946 by Michelin.

When Charles J. Pilliod Jr. became CEO in 1974, he faced a major investment decision regarding the radial tire, which today has a market share of nearly 100%. Despite heavy criticism at the time, Pilliod invested heavily in new factories and tooling to build the radial tire. Sam Gibara, who headed Goodyear from 1996 to 2003, has noted that without the action of Pilliod, Goodyear &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be around today.&quot;

Sales for 1969 topped $3 billion. Five years later sales topped $5 billion and Goodyear operated in 34 countries. In 1978, the original Akron plant was converted into a Technical Center for research and design. By 1985, worldwide sales exceeded $10 billion.

Goodyear Aerospace, a holding that developed from the Goodyear Aircraft Company after World War II, designed a supercomputer for NASA&#x27;s Goddard Spaceflight Center in 1979, the MPP. The subsidiary was sold in 1987 to the Loral Corporation as a result of restructuring.

In 1987, Goodyear formed a business partnership with Canadian tire retailer Fountain Tire.

=== Diversification and Goldsmith affair 1986 ===
In the 1980s, incoming Goodyear CEO Robert E. Mercer argued that the tire and automobile-related businesses that formed the core of Goodyear to that date were slow growing and a handicap. He set a strategy &quot;to get away from the cyclical nature of the automobile business through mergers or purchase of businesses unrelated to tires or vehicles.&quot;

In 1983, Goodyear acquired the natural gas company Celeron Corporation in exchange for stock valued at more than $740 million. It went on to invest heavily in gas exploration including the 1,200 mile crude oil &quot;All American&quot; pipeline from California to Texas. The project was initially estimated to cost $600 million but ultimately cost almost $1 billion.

In October 1986 British financier James Goldsmith in conjunction with the investment group Hanson purchased 11.5% of Goodyear&#x27;s outstanding common stock. This was viewed as a greenmail attack by some, and as shareholder activism by Goldsmith, who viewed the company&#x27;s move into areas far removed from tire development production and sale as commercially ill-advised and wanted the company to divest, especially, its oil interests which he viewed as depressing the value of the company.

On November 20, 1986, Goodyear acquired all of the stock held by Goldsmith&#x27;s group (12,549,400 shares) at an above-market price of $49.50 per share. Goodyear also made a tender offer for up to 40 million shares of its stock from other shareholders at $50 per share. The tender offer resulted in Goodyear buying 40,435,764 shares of stock in February 1987.

As a result of the stock buyback, Goodyear took a charge of $224.6 million associated with a massive restructuring plan. It sold its Goodyear Aerospace business to Loral Corporation for $588 million and its motor wheel business to Lemmerz Inc. for $175 million. Two subsidiaries involved in agricultural products, real estate development, and a resort hotel in Arizona were sold for $220.1 million. The company also sold the Celeron gas and oil corporation. In 1998, the All American Pipeline, Celeron Gathering, and Celeron Trading and Transportation were sold, largely completing what Goldsmith&#x27;s hostile takeover had suggested good management should do. In the years following 1987, the company invested in its tire business. President Tom Barrett succeeded Chairman Robert Mercer in 1989, and began a process of modernizing and expanding Goodyear plants in cities like Lawton, Oklahoma, Napanee, Canada, Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Scottsboro, Alabama. In the 2000s, the move of business into low-wage countries, facilitated by GATT (which Goldsmith had warned government against, calling it &quot;a policy to impoverish&quot;), resulted in plants across North America being shuttered, for instance Cumberland, Maryland; New Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and Windsor, Vermont were closed.

===1990 to present===

The last major restructuring of the company took place in 1991. Goodyear hired Stanley Gault, former CEO of Rubbermaid, to expand the company into new markets. The moves resulted in 12,000 employees being laid off.

In 2005, Titan Tire purchased the farm tire business of Goodyear, and manufactures Goodyear agricultural tires under license. This acquisition included the plant in Freeport, Illinois.

In the summer of 2009, the company announced it would close its tire plant in the Philippines as part of a strategy to address uncompetitive manufacturing capacity globally by the end of the third quarter of that year.

Goodyear announced plans to sell the assets of its Latin American off-road tire business to Titan Tire for $98.6 million, including the plant in São Paulo, Brazil and a licensing agreement that allows Titan to continue manufacturing under the Goodyear brand. This deal is similar to Titan&#x27;s 2005 purchase of Goodyear&#x27;s US farm tire assets.

In 2011, more than 70 years after the dissolution of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation, it is announced that Goodyear would partner with Zeppelin again (the legacy company Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik) to build more zeppelins together.

In 2018, Goodyear and Bridgestone announced the creation of TireHub, a joint wholesale distribution network across the United States. At the same time, Goodyear also announced that it was ending its distribution relationship with American Tire Distributors, which is the largest tire wholesaler in the US.

In 2018, Goodyear was ordered to pay $40.1 million to J. Walter Twidwell, who claimed he developed mesothelioma because of exposure to asbestos. After the trial, Goodyear asked the New York Supreme Court for a new trial. Goodyear attorney James Lynch said Goodyear did not receive proper consideration from the jury. Lynch said that the other side&#x27;s attorneys engaged in character assassinations against expert witnesses. During closing remarks, the attorneys for Twidwell put up a slide with the heads of Goodyear&#x27;s expert witnesses pasted onto &quot;insulting caricatures.&quot;

In December 2018, Goodyear ceased operations in Venezuela due a lack of materials and rising costs resulting from hyperinflation.

In February 2021, Goodyear announced that it would acquire the Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company for $2.5 billion. The transaction closed in the second half of 2021.

==Controversies==

===Foreign relations with Indonesia in the 1960s===

Following the military coup in Indonesia in 1965, the Indonesian president Suharto encouraged Goodyear to return and offered rubber resources and political prisoners as labor. In an NBC special aired in 1967, reporter Ted Yates aired footage showing former Communist rubber union workers escorted at gunpoint to the rubber plantation.

Bad as things are in Indonesia, one positive fact is known. Indonesia has a fabulous potential wealth in natural resources and the New Order [the fascist regime headed by pro-U.S. General Suharto] wants it exploited. So they are returning the private properties expropriated by Sukarno&#x27;s regime. Goodyear&#x27;s Sumatran rubber empire is an example. It was seized [by the rubber workers] in retaliation for U.S. aggression in Vietnam in 1965. The rubber workers union was Communist-run, so after the coup many of them were killed or imprisoned. Some of the survivors, you see them here, still work the rubber – but this time as prisoners, and at gunpoint.

===Pay discrimination lawsuits===
United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated,

Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at Goodyear Tire and Rubber&#x27;s plant in Gadsden, Alabama, from 1979 until her retirement in 1998. For most of those years, she worked as an area manager, a position largely occupied by men. Initially, Ledbetter&#x27;s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work. Over time, however, her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority. By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the lowest paid male area manager received $4,286 per month, the highest paid, $5,236.

Lilly Ledbetter sued Goodyear claiming she was paid less than men doing the same work. She won the suit and was awarded $360,000, the jury deciding that Goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. In &quot;Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.&quot;, 550 U.S. 618 (2007), Justice Alito held for the five-justice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer 180 days ago or more. The United States Congress overturned this decision by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 which was the first bill signed into law by President Obama.

This was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation. The plaintiff in this case, Lilly Ledbetter, characterized her situation as one where &quot;disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period, but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period.&quot; In rejecting Ledbetter&#x27;s appeal, the Supreme Court said that &quot;she could have, and should have, sued&quot; when the pay decisions were made, instead of waiting beyond the 180-day statutory charging period.

Justice Ginsburg dissented from the opinion of the court, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer. She argued against applying the 180-day limit to pay discrimination, because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time. Furthermore, the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison. Ginsburg argued that pay discrimination is inherently different from adverse actions, such as termination. Adverse actions are obvious, but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than 180 days of the pay change. Ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the court&#x27;s &quot;cramped&quot; interpretation. Her dissent asserted that the employer had been, &quot;Knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward&quot; during the 180-day charging period, and therefore could be held liable.

===Environmental record===
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Goodyear as the 19th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with roughly 4.16 million lbs of toxins released into the air annually. Major pollutants included sulfuric acid, cobalt compounds, and chlorine. The Center for Public Integrity reports that Goodyear has been named as a potentially responsible party in at least 54 of the nation&#x27;s Superfund toxic waste sites.
On February 8, 2008, Goodyear announced the launch of an environmentally friendly tire produced using a cornstarch-based material. The Goodyear Eagle LS2000 partially replaces the traditional carbon black and silica with filler materials derived from corn starch thanks to &quot;BioTRED compounding technology&quot;. The new technology increases the tires &quot;flexibility and resistance to energy loss&quot;, which extend the tires life-span and lessen the impact on the environment. Similarly, Goodyear announced on April 22, 2008, that it had joined the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s SmartWay Transport Partnership. The transport partnership is an attempt between the truck transportation industry and the EPA to reduce air pollution and greenhouse emissions as well as increase energy efficiency. The SmartWay partnership&#x27;s tractors and trailers will use Goodyear&#x27;s Fuel Max linehaul tires that increase fuel efficiency while reducing emissions. According to Goodyear and EPA officials &quot;the fuel-efficient line-haul tires deliver up to 4% improved truck fuel economy, and when used with other SmartWay-qualified components, each 18- wheel tractor and trailer used in long-haul can produce savings of up to 4,000 gallons per year, or more than $11,000 annually.&quot;

===Foreign Corrupt Practices Act charges===

On February 24, 2015, Goodyear agreed to pay more than $16 million to settle Foreign Corrupt Practices Act &quot;FCPA&quot; charges that two of its African subsidiaries allegedly paid $3.2 million in bribes that generated $14,122,535 in illicit profits. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission &quot;SEC&quot; FCPA charges involved Goodyear subsidiaries in Kenya and Angola for allegedly paying bribes to government and private-sector workers in exchange for sales in each country. According to the SEC because &quot;Goodyear did not prevent or detect these improper payments because it failed to implement adequate FCPA compliance controls at its subsidiaries&quot; and, for the Kenyan subsidiary, &quot;because it failed to conduct adequate due diligence&quot; prior to its acquisition. It was not alleged that Goodyear had any involvement with or knowledge of its subsidiaries&#x27; improper conduct.

===Internal training and discrimination===

On August 18, 2020, WIBW, a local CBS-affiliate television station, reported that an internal PowerPoint slide on political attire from a Topeka, Kansas, training seminar was circulating on social media. The leaked slide depicted a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy towards some political movements. President Donald Trump called for a boycott of Goodyear tires the following day, as Trump campaign attire such as MAGA hats were among the banned products. Goodyear responded via Twitter, stating &quot;the visual in question was not created or distributed by Goodyear corporate, nor was it part of a diversity training class&quot;. Following release of the audio that went with the slide, Goodyear admitted the slide was used at its Topeka factory.

=== Tire blowouts ===
Defective tires are suspected to be the cause of multiple truck accidents and fatal injuries that occurred in France, Spain and other European countries in the 2010s, according to an investigation published in the French daily &quot;Le Monde&quot; in March 2024. According to the journalists, although Goodyear was aware of the problems, it did not recognize them. While the company quietly withdrew defective tires from the market and offered indemnities to the family of victims, it did not initially recognize the tires were defective and did not implement the European Union rapid alert system for unsafe consumer products, called Rapex.

==Manufacturing and development facilities==
== Goodyear blimp &quot;Spirit of America&quot; ==
In August 2015, Goodyear Airship Operations announced the retirement of the &quot;Spirit of America&quot; blimp. This GZ-20A model airship, based in Carson, California, was part of a transition to a more high-tech fleet of airships.

=== Retirement and transition ===
The &quot;Spirit of America,&quot; christened on September 5, 2002, was retired after 13 years of service. Its retirement was part of Goodyear&#x27;s initiative to introduce a new generation of NT Zeppelin model airships. A series of final events marked the blimp&#x27;s retirement, including coverage of the ESPYS, Crossfit Games, and the Special Olympics World Games LA 2015 Opening Ceremony. The blimp&#x27;s final voyage was a 29-day West Coast Tour culminating in its decommissioning in mid-August 2015.

Goodyear organized a public retirement celebration on August 7 and 8, 2015, offering a last opportunity for the community to view the blimp up close. The &quot;Spirit of Innovation,&quot; the &quot;Spirit of America&#x27;s&quot; twin ship, was set to replace it in the Los Angeles market by late September 2015.

=== Operational achievements ===
During its operational years, &quot;Spirit of America&quot; conducted 8,005 flights, carrying 30,280 passengers for a total of 13,436 flight hours. The blimp was named as a tribute to American patriotism following September 11, 2001. It appeared at numerous events, including the Rose Parade and Academy Awards, and was featured in television shows. In 2011, it was rebranded for the premiere of &quot;Cars 2.&quot;

<text>GKS Katowice (; GKS stands for , ) is a Polish professional football club based in Katowice. They currently compete in the Ekstraklasa in the 2024–25 season after gaining promotion from the I liga in 2024.

==History==

In 1963 in Katowice a special organizational committee was called with the purpose of uniting all the clubs and sporting organizations of the city into one large club which would encompass many disciplines. In mid-1963 Rapid Wełnowiec and Orzeł Wełnowiec merged, creating Rapid/Orzeł. In 1964 Rapid/Orzeł, Górnik Katowice, Koszutka Katowice, Katowicki Klub Łyżwiarski (Katowice Skating Club), Katowicki Klub Sportowy Górnik, Górniczy Klub Żeglarski Szkwał (a sailing club) amongst other clubs from Katowice merged creating GKS Katowice. Four years later on the 9 August 1968, Dąb Katowice also amalgamated with GKS Katowice. GKS Katowice made its debut in Polish football&#x27;s top league (now called the Ekstraklasa) on 8 August 1965 when GKS Katowice took on local rivals Górnik Zabrze.

GKS Katowice&#x27;s debut season in the top flight was in the 1965–66 season. In 1971, Katowice was relegated to the 2nd Division. The club&#x27;s problems were eventually overcome, and GKS returned to the top flight. From 1982 the club consistently found itself up the top end of the ladder, as well as playing off in several Polish Cup finals. In 1985 GKS Katowice played in its first Polish Cup final but lost in a penalty shootout to Widzew Łódź. The following year GKS played off in a final at Stadion Śląski against Górnik Zabrze; GKS won 4–1. From that moment the city of Katowice began to live and breathe football. The next year GKS finished third and the two following years they were runners-up. In the 1989–90 season GKS again came third, and in the 1991–92 season GKS were runners-up. From 1986 to 1995 to GKS Katowice were four times runners-up in the league, twice the winners of the Polish Super Cup and three-time Polish Cup winners.

The biggest moments for the club and fans were when the team took part in European cups. The first time GKS faced European opposition was in 1970, in the now defunct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, GKS took on Spanish club Barcelona in a two-legged tie. Katowice lost (2–4 on aggregate), but the fans were proud of their club. The second time GKS took part in European football they showed more and played better football. In the first round of the 1986–87 UEFA Cup Winners Cup, GKS defeated Icelandic side Fram Reykjavík before losing in the second round to Switzerland&#x27;s Sion. For the next 10 years, GKS Katowice took part in European football. Over the years fans of GKS got to witness their team take on the likes of Sportul Studentsc Bucharest, Rangers, Club Brugge, Galatasaray, Benfica, Aris, Girondins Bordeaux and twice Bayer Leverkusen. GKS&#x27;s record in European football stands at 10 wins, 7 draws, and 19 losses.

GKS Katowice again fell on hard times during the mining crisis. Following the 1998–99 season, the team was relegated from the Ekstraklasa, but was back in the topflight a year later. Piotr Dziurowicz became president who, despite growing debts and financial troubles, kept the team in the top flight. In 2003, the team managed to qualify for the UEFA Cup by finishing third in the league under coach Jan Żurek. This was hailed as one of the biggest surprises ever in the history of the Ekstraklasa. Despite the success, the debts under Piotr Dziurowicz began to grow to a significant sum.
From 27 March 2003 to 11 June 2004, the club played under the name of its main sponsor Dospel Katowice; this was not taken well by the fans of the club. GKS Katowice Sportowa Spółka Akcyjna finished its reins at the helm of the club in the summer of 2005 after the 2004–05 season where GKS finished 14th (and last) in the Ekstraklasa and was relegated to the second division. The team had to drop to the fourth division due to financial problems and their involvement in the 2003–2005 match-fixing scandal. After the drop to the 4th division, a group of fans known as the &quot;Stowarzyszenie Sympatyków Klubu GKS Katowice&quot; (which loosely translates into Society of Well Wishers Club of GKS Katowice) took over the helm at the club. In June 2006, the club was promoted to the third-tier, and in June 2007 the team advanced to the second division, which in 2008 was renamed I liga.

On 26 May 2024, they clinched promotion during the last matchday of the 2023–24 season after a 1–0 away victory over Arka Gdynia, tying them on points, but finishing ahead in the standings on head-to-head difference. They were promoted to Ekstraklasa as runners-up, ending their 19-year absence from the top tier.

<text>Polonia Warsaw (, ), founded on 19 November 1911, is the oldest existing sports club in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, best known for its football and basketball teams. It also has track and field, swimming, chess, mountain biking, and contract bridge sections. Historically it also had sections in ice hockey, fencing, tennis, volleyball, &quot;hazena&quot;, cycling and boxing.

The football team competes in the I liga, the second level of the Polish football league system.

== History ==
=== 20th century ===
==== Beginnings ====
Polonia Warsaw was formed in the autumn of 1911 as a union of several &quot;gimnazjum&quot; school teams (including &quot;Stella&quot; and &quot;Merkury&quot;). Alongside co-founders Wacław Gebethner, Stefan Pronaszko, and Tadeusz Gebethner, Wacław &quot;Denhoff&quot; Czarnocki was the co-founder of the club who also came up with its name. &quot;Polonia&quot; is Latin for &quot;Poland&quot; and is often used by Polish migrants in reference to the diaspora communities of Poles living abroad in other countries. The choice of such a name was a brave decision in the early 20th century, since Poland was not an independent country at this time, and Warsaw was part of the Russian partition; Poles living there were often subjected to repression and cultural imperialism from the Russian authorities ruling the Vistula Land. Due to this, Polonia could not be registered officially until political changes brought about by the advance of German troops into Russian-controlled lands in the First World War.

Initially, the players played in black-and-white striped shirts, but in the spring of 1912 they switched to their now traditional design of all black shirts. This was thanks to Janusz Mück, longtime player of the team, who bought the new tops. The legendary patriotic explanation for this colour scheme was that it was a sign of mourning for the occupied and divided motherland of Poland. This lasting devotion to tradition resulted in the club&#x27;s popular name: &quot;Czarne koszule&quot; (&quot;The Black Shirts&quot;). The uniform&#x27;s white shorts and red socks come from the colours of the Polish flag.

The club&#x27;s first match on 19 November 1911 was against a strong local rival, Korona, and ended 3:4 in favour of Korona. Two years later, in February 1913, the Black Shirts defeated Korona 4:0. During World War I, German occupiers were slightly more liberal in their ways than their previous Russian counterparts, and allowed the official registration of sports clubs on Polish territory. Thus on 15 October 1915 Polonia officially became a football club, despite already existing illegally for four years prior to this event.
The first match between Polonia and its younger rival Legia Warsaw (formed in 1916) was played on 29 April 1917, ending in a 1:1 draw. It was the first historic &quot;Great Derby of Warsaw&quot; – the clash of these two rival teams from the Polish capital. A month later, there was a second match between the teams, ending with the same score. Hatred divided their supporters early in the clubs&#x27; history and continues to this day, driving strong emotions during the matches and sometimes even violence between matches.

==== Interwar period ====

In 1921, the Black Shirts came second in the first-ever season of the Polish football championship. In 1926, they also finished the season as joint-champions. Polonia was Warsaw&#x27;s favourite club at the time – the great majority of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were devoted Black Shirt supporters. In the late 1930s, Polonia became one of the powerhouses of Polish football, with players such as: Jerzy Bulanow, Władysław Szczepaniak, Erwin Nyc, and Henryk Jaźnicki capping for the national team. The friendship between Polonia and KS Cracovia – the prewar Polish football legend (formed in 1906) and the first ever champions of Poland (1921) – dates back to these days, when both teams readily accepted players from foreign nationalities and religious backgrounds in what was a highly politicised time for Polish football.

KSP achieved many successes during the two decades between the world wars, establishing itself as a club with sections in: hockey, athletics, football, fencing, tennis, volleyball, basketball, swimming, &quot;hazena&quot;, cycling, and boxing. Although the first match between the two teams occurred earlier in 1917, the official beginning of the Varsovian derby is dated to 10 June 1921, when the Black Shirts beat Legia Warszawa 8:0. The rivalry between these two clubs continued to grow in the interwar period, during which they played against each other a total of 27 matches; Polonia secured 14 victories, Legia won 8 times, whereas 5 games ended in a draw. Construction of Polonia&#x27;s own stadium began in 1925 and ended in 1928. Ten years later, the Union of Polish Sports Associations proclaimed &quot;Klub Sportowy Polonia Warszawa&quot; the best Polish sports club of 1938.

==== World War II ====

After the Second World War began, Poland was divided between the occupying forces of the Third Reich and the USSR. Warsaw ended up in the Nazi German occupied zone known as the General Government. Under the policies of Generalplan Ost and Lebensraum, Slavs were to become a race of slaves and eventually exterminated. Authorities of the German occupying forces thus forbid Poles from practicing sports; despite this, KSP continued to play illegally, taking part in various underground initiatives and winning the secret Varsovian Championship in 1942 and 1943.

Many of Polonia&#x27;s players were involved in the resistance movement against the Nazis; some perished in concentration or death camps, some were executed, while others managed to survive the war. A prominent example is that of Tadeusz Gebethner, one of the club&#x27;s founders as well as its first president and captain. An experienced soldier, he joined the Union of Armed Struggle (precursor of the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;) in 1940. Starting from 1942, Gebethner provided shelter to a family of Jews in his own home while risking his life as a member of the Home Army. He would go on to take part in the Warsaw Uprising, during which he was wounded twice. After the fall of the uprising he was transferred by the German forces to the Stalag XI-A POW camp, where he perished from sustained wounds on 14 October 1944. Tadeusz Gebethner was posthumously recognised as Righteous Among the Nations in 1981.

Pre-war footballers of Polonia, Adam Kogut and Julian Niemczycki, and athletes Wincenty Fryszczyn and Wacław Znajdowski, were among Poles murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940.

The Kazimierz Sosnkowski Stadium sustained major damage during the war, particularly during the Warsaw Uprising – since Polish insurgents used it as a battlefield against Nazi forces – and the systematic destruction of Warsaw that followed. It was finally rebuilt by the 1950s. Murals dedicated to the Polish partisans who fought against the German invaders have been painted along the walls of the stadium by the club&#x27;s supporters in remembrance of these events.

==== The first Championship, the first Polish Cup, and relegation ====
In 1946, Polonia finally won the Polish Championship title. It was symbolic among the ruins of the bombed and burned capital. The final match was played on &quot;Wojska Polskiego&quot; Stadium (the Polish Army&#x27;s – Legia&#x27;s – ground) on Łazienkowska Street, because Polonia&#x27;s stadium on 6 Konwiktorska Street (which lay close to the Jewish ghetto area) had been ruined during the war. The Black Shirts defeated AKS Chorzów in the final.
During the Stalinist period, Polonia&#x27;s name and colours were changed; every Polish football club received a national sponsor, such as the army, militsiya, mining industry, etc. – Warsaw&#x27;s oldest club was renamed &quot;Kolejarz&quot; (&quot;Railroad worker&quot;), as the team was now tied to the Polish State Railways. At the time, the railroad was one of the poorest sponsors, even choosing another club, Lech Poznań, as the main club they were investing in. Polonia&#x27;s management also struggled to face the problems that the club came across, which contributed to its eventual relegation to the Polish second division. The traditional black shirts of the team&#x27;s kit were banned, as the Stalinist regime was trying to erase everything which was associated with Warsaw from before the war. In 1952, Polonia Warsaw won their first Polish Cup. In the final, Polonia managed to outscore local rivals Legia Warsaw 1:0, much to the delight of Warsaw&#x27;s fans, who would still continue to mainly support KSP until the 1960s. Several years after Stalin&#x27;s death, the thaw in the politics of the Eastern Bloc allowed KSP to return to its original name of &quot;Polonia Warszawa&quot; in 1956.

Years later, there were still thousands of fans on Konwiktorska Street as nobody thought it would take 40 years for Polonia to come back to top-flight football, but Legia was becoming more popular and achieving greater successes. One of the reasons behind this was that all the young men, promising footballers to be from all over Poland, and especially the Warsaw youth academies, were called up for compulsory army training, which in the PRL lasted about 5 years or sometimes even longer. Many of the players received an offer to play for the army-sponsored Legia Warsaw, which led to some of the biggest successes of Polonia&#x27;s bitter rivals in the 1960s. To this day, many of KSP&#x27;s fans attribute Legia&#x27;s current popularity in Warsaw to the backing that the &quot;Legioniści&quot; received in the PRL regime as well as Legia&#x27;s &quot;stealing&quot; of talented players.

==== Back to the top flight ====
In the 1992–1993 season, after 40 years of playing in the lower leagues, Polonia Warsaw was finally promoted to the first division again. However, the organisation of the club was insufficient to compete with the strongest clubs in Polish football – the biggest problems being a lack of money and no sound training base. After one season, the team was relegated yet again, but only for a year as in the 1995–1996 season &quot;Polonia Warszawa&quot; won promotion again. In 1996, Janusz Romanowski took over as chairman of Polonia, having just backed out from sponsoring local rivals Legia Warszawa, and brought the &quot;Poloniści&quot; back to Ekstraklasa. In 1998, the &quot;Czarne koszule&quot; finished runner-up in the top flight and in 1999 reached the semi-finals of the Intertoto Cup.

=== 21st century ===
==== The second Championship, the second Polish Cup, and another relegation ====
In the 1999–2000 season, Polonia were not considered challengers for the title. And yet by the end of the autumn round, the Black Shirts were leading the entire league. That team had two managers – Jerzy Engel (who later became the coach of the Poland national team, which qualified for the 2002 World Cup) and Dariusz Wdowczyk (former Polish international player). During the winter break, Polonia signed two talented players in Tomasz Wieszczycki and Tomasz Kiełbowicz. Financially, KSP benefited by securing a sponsorship from the Hoop Cola soft drinks producer that was popular in Poland at the time. In the spring round, the Black Shirts lost only two games and drew one.

KSP won the Polish Championship in 2000 after triumphing over Legia Warsaw at their rivals&#x27; stadium with a score of 3:0. Prior to that, the team also won a League Cup yet again beating Legia Warszawa away 2:1. In July, they confirmed their place as the best that year, by winning the Super Cup in a match against Polish Cup winners Amica Wronki by a score of 4:2. These were also the times of Emmanuel Olisadebe, a Nigerian footballer who migrated to Poland and eventually became a Polish football legend after acquiring citizenship and playing for the national team in 2000–2004 (thus becoming the first black player on the Poland national team); Olisadebe initially began his career in Poland with &quot;Polonia Warszawa&quot; in 1997 and remained there until 2001.

In the UEFA Champions League qualifiers, the Black Shirts won in the 2nd qualification round against Dinamo București (3:1, 7:4 aggregate), only to lose at the hands of Panathinaikos Athens (1:2, aggregate 3:4) in the final qualification round. Despite losing the battle for the Champions League, Polonia Warszawa started in 1st round of the UEFA Cup where they lost to Udinese Calcio twice with scores of 0:1 and 0:2.

Come the 2000/2001 season and the Black Shirts began to lose their form, playing poorly in the 1st division, yet still managing to win The Polish Cup. During the next few years, Polonia managed to stay in the top division, however finishing mainly in the bottom part of the table. During this time, the club was owned and sponsored by a longtime supporter, Jan Raniecki, a car parts company entrepreneur. Unfortunately, Raniecki died after a heart attack on 1 March 2006. His family, who inherited the club, were not interested in running and sponsoring Polonia, so the search for a new owner began.

==== Start of the JW era ====

In March 2006, the club was bought out by a new owner, Józef Wojciechowski, the owner of JW Construction, the biggest housing development company in Poland. The club budget was strengthened and, at first, it seemed that Polonia would quickly become one of the main forces in Polish football yet again. However, the club was relegated to the 2nd division after ending in last place in 2005/2006.

In the 2006/2007 season, Polonia struggled to get promoted to the 1st division again, coming close but ultimately failing, finishing in sixth place. There were reports in the newspapers that some older players in the squad were not interested in promotion, as they probably would have lost their places in the team had Polonia gone up. In 2007, a bar/cafe called &quot;Czarna Koszula&quot; (Black Shirt) for fans of the club was opened at the stadium by Paweł Puchalski, former KSP driver; featuring memorabilia from the team&#x27;s history, it serves as both a social venue and a small museum for the club. The little pub, praised for its positive and friendly atmosphere, has positive ratings and over the years became an important meeting place for the fans, players, and staff of Polonia alike.
In July 2008, Polonia Warsaw merged with Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski (3rd in the Ekstraklasa in 2007/08) and took over its place in the Polish top division. Most of Dyskobolia&#x27;s players moved to Warsaw to form the core of Polonia&#x27;s new team. Several players from Polonia&#x27;s old squad stayed in the club too. The team managed to finish 4th at the end of the 2008/2009 season, and subsequently reached the 3rd qualification round of the Europa League. After beating Budućnost Podgorica 2:1 and winning 5:9 against Juvenes/Dogana, Polonia gave in 1:4 to the Dutch side NAC Breda during the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League.

In 2009/2010, after several changes in managerial positions, and with the team performing below expectations (15th place – mid-season), the club chairman Józef Wojciechowski decided to employ the former FC Barcelona captain José Mari Bakero as manager. Although the team was last in the league at that point, Bakero managed to save the season by avoiding relegation and winning against the local rivals Legia Warszawa for the first time in 10 years. It was also Polonia&#x27;s first win against its bitter rivals at home in 60 years, sending supporters into the summer break ecstatic.

==== 100th birthday and end of JW ====

For the 100th anniversary of Polonia Warszawa&#x27;s (season 2010/11), its owner Józef Wojciechowski strengthened the squad significantly, by signing 6 new players – including Ebi Smolarek and Artur Sobiech – raising the expectations and hopes of fans for the new season dramatically.

Things got off to a good start with 3 wins (including a 3–0 prestigious victory over Legia Warsaw) and a draw from 4 matches and first place in the standings. However, the press was reporting difficulties with the relationship between the team owner and the coach. After suffering the first defeat of the season to Korona Kielce at home, Józef Wojciechowski and José Mari Bakero parted company – against the supporters&#x27; wishes. The former Polish national team manager Paweł Janas, already working at the club as football director, was installed as a replacement for the Spaniard, signing a 2-year contract.
It all went from bad to worse for Polonia from that point on. A string of unconvincing performances from the team left Polonia in 8th place, 10 points from the top of the table after the 1st round. On 6 January 2011, Dutch national Theo Bos was confirmed as the new manager of the club. However he lasted only 5 matches and was dismissed after losing in the Polish Cup and amassing just 1 point from 3 league games, leaving the club only 3 points above the relegation zone. Assistant coach Piotr Stokowiec had been promoted to the head role, but like his predecessors he didn&#x27;t last long, being sacked after just one defeat to Widzew Łódź. Tarnobrzeg-born Jacek Zieliński, who had been sacked from Polonia Warsaw back in 2009 by Józef Wojciechowski, was appointed as the new head coach. Polonia won 5 out of 7 matches under Zieliński, saving itself from relegation, and finally finished in 7th place in 2010–11 Ekstraklasa. On 6 June 2011, Polonia&#x27;s star playmaker Adrian Mierzejewski was sold to Trabzonspor for a record fee in Polish football history of 21 million zł (5,3 mln euro).
On 11 October 2011, Polish football legend Włodzimierz Lubański was appointed as vice-chairman/sports director to relieve Józef Wojciechowski of his duties, in order to secure Polonia&#x27;s immediate future. Lubański lasted a mere 3 months.

To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Polonia Warsaw in 2011, the National Bank of Poland issued commemorative general circulation 2 zł and 5 zł coins, depicting the club&#x27;s crest. This was the first such honour for a football club in Poland.

On 28 March 2012, Jacek Zieliński was replaced by Czesław Michniewicz as KSP&#x27;s manager. Despite a 3–0 victory over champions to be Śląsk Wrocław in his debut, Michniewicz had a string of poor results and failed to win the title; worse yet, Polonia failed to qualify for the European league, finishing &quot;only&quot; 6th in the Ekstraklasa. For Józef Wojciechowski this was too much and he decided to withdraw from football altogether, offloading the club to Ireneusz Król in July after an unseen by European standards deconstruction of the team in which over 15 players left; the club ceased to exist for a week, ending the &quot;JW era&quot; on a massive low and causing an outpouring of hatred from fans for Wojciechowski due to his capricious decisions.

==== Back from the dead, only to fall with the &quot;King&quot; ====

On 24 July 2012, a week after buying out Polonia&#x27;s players to move them to Katowice, the new owner Ireneusz Król (his surname literally meaning &quot;King&quot; in Polish) acquired the rights to the club name and the emblem for a symbolic &quot;1zł&quot; and kept the club in its rightful place, despite rumours of a merger with GKS Katowice in which Król had &quot;invested&quot; in previous years. By then the youth coach Piotr Stokowiec was appointed as Polonia&#x27;s first coach, and started building the new team based around literally 11 survivors from the previous season, mixing them with young (ME) talents and lower leagues players, notably the promising Under-21 Polish central midfielder Tomasz Hołota was signed.

Mid-season however, with Polonia surprisingly sitting in 3rd place in Ekstraklasa, merit to young coach Piotr Stokowiec, the worst possible scenario turned out to be true as Król was revealed as a financially unreliable owner. Delays in contract payments caused a repeat of the turmoil from the summer; in 2013 Polonia lost more than half of its first team again, and nearly all the high-priced players left on free transfers. Adding insult to injury, Polonia&#x27;s star players joined main title rivals, Georgian National striker Vladimir Dvalishvili and influential winger Tomasz Brzyski switched to Legia Warsaw, whereas young talented Poland national poacher Łukasz Teodorczyk joined Lech Poznań. Additionally KSP&#x27;s &quot;enfant terrible&quot; and top scorer from the previous season, Edgar Çani, joined Catania – leaving Polonia with only one striker (of four at the beginning) to finish the season. Almost the entire defensive block was destroyed with Đorđe Čotra, Adam Kokoszka, and the experienced Marcin Baszczyński leaving the club; the recently signed midfielder Hołota escaped Król&#x27;s mismanagement too.

On the positive side, Paweł Wszołek rejected a last-minute move to German outfit Hannover 96 to stay at Polonia till the end of the season. Sebastian Przyrowski and Łukasz Piątek – two players with around a hundred caps for Polonia (Przyrowski had 99, Piątek 122) – along with defender Aleksandar Todorovski decided to stay at the club a bit longer, despite the financial situation being very unclear and debts mounting. Manager Piotr Stokowiec, after the success of the first round, had to re-build the team from scratch again – just like he did at the beginning of the season, and both times he succeeded far above expectations. Among last-minute deals and loans of young talented players, Polonia surprisingly signed the experienced 23-year-old Estonian national defender Igor Morozov from Levadia Tallinn. Stokowiec converted a few players&#x27; positions to fill in the gaps, notably Polonia&#x27;s only striker and new captain Daniel Gołębiewski was shifted to left-back, leaving Polonia with only midfielders to play up front.

Despite performances remaining at a high level, KSP witnessed a string of poor results mainly due to off-pitch troubles. On 3 April 2013, Ireneusz Król&#x27;s &quot;IDEON&quot; filed for a strategic bankruptcy (with the possibility of an agreement). With increasing debts, doubts over Polonia&#x27;s future existence were mounting as the licensing process for the next season coincided with the exact date of IDEON&#x27;s financial debt clearing deadlines. There have been accusations of fraud on Król&#x27;s part.

Despite efforts from the association of Polonia fans to regain control over the club to clear the debts with new sponsors and ensure KSP&#x27;s survival, Król was not interested. On 28 May 2013, Polonia did not receive a license for the coming season in the Ekstraklasa, due to an outstanding debt of around 8 million Polish złoty. Subsequently, the club lost its place in the PZPN (Polish football association) ranks. On 17 June 2013, Ireneusz Król filed for bankruptcy of &quot;Polonia Warszawa S.A.&quot;. Due to the circumstances, despite finishing 6th in the 2012–13 Ekstraklasa, KSP automatically dropped five league levels to the lowest level in its 101-year history.

==== Another year, another resurrection ====

On 20 June 2013, the Mazovian Football Association (MZPN) confirmed a place in the semi-professional Mazovian &quot;Liga okręgowa&quot; (6th tier in Poland) for the newly formed &quot;Polonia Warszawa&quot; (senior) team, which was created by an association of Polonia&#x27;s supporters led by Grzegorz Popielarz, and based on the youth players of MKS Polonia Warszawa, a local youth academy, which was not a part of KSP Polonia Warszawa S.A. (Ltd.) owned and destroyed by Ireneusz Król. Due to &quot;sporting merits&quot; MZPN along with PZPN (Polish Football Association) changed their previous decision, and Polonia was moved up one tier to the IV liga (5th tier in Poland) – the bottom of the professional league in the PZPN structure.

Piotr Dziewicki was named as the new manager, and along with sports director Paweł Olczak they managed to find and sign 26 players, within a month – most of whom were connected with the MKS Polonia academy recently or played in the main Polonia Warsaw team at higher levels before; the club managed to regain control over its stadium and restarted with its historical coat of arms (since the rights to the old official logo were still left with Król), as well as switching to a kit with black-and-white striped tops reminiscent of the club&#x27;s pre-1912 colours.

The debut for the newly formed Polonia Warsaw team was set for Łomianki, a nearby town just outside of the capital. The game started very well for the Black Shirts, with the experienced Polonia legend Jacek Kosmalski (109 caps for Polonia) scoring only after 10 minutes, and Michał Strzałkowski adding another goal 5 minutes later. Unfortunately the game had to be suspended after 36 minutes, due to third party hooligans as fans of Legia Warsaw (supposedly supporting KS Łomianki) put up illegal banners, threw objects onto the playing field, and finally invaded the pitch in numbers, resulting in riots with the police and subsequently ending the match for both clubs.

However, only a week later, on 25 August 2013 the dream debut was realised. Polonia&#x27;s community proved their worth organising an unforgettable footballing spectacle with the stadium at almost full capacity (unseen before at 5th tier football); during the match Polonia Warsaw&#x27;s newly resurrected team beat Wkra Żuromin 6:0, with Michał Strzałkowski scoring a hat-trick, and more importantly leaving the thus far unknown Polonia team as the main title contender in the league. The team was strengthened mid-season, with experienced Mariusz Ujek replacing Kosmalski, joined by ex-Polonia Warszawa ME (youth) players that used to train with the Ekstraklasa team a few years earlier, notably Dominik Lemanek and Michał Gliński. Two Nigerian players, Adeniyi Lekan and Tony Uzoma Chukwuemeka, also joined the club to follow in the footsteps of KSP legend Emmanuel Olisadebe. Polonia speedily won the promotion to III liga in June 2014, with one game to spare.

Against the supporters&#x27; wishes, Piotr Dziewicki was let go, despite proving his worth, after the club and Dziewicki were unable to come to an agreement. Mid-season, at the end of 2014, more dubious decisions were taken by the club – after a very poor round with an almost unknown coach, Polonia hired coach Dariusz Dźwigała, only to let him go after just a few successful games. A few strong players were let go by the club with no official explanation: Błenszykowski, Gliński, and notably Lemanek as well as Szymanek left the club. Piotr Szczechowicz had a short episode as manager of the club, only to be dropped a few games before the end of a poor season. Club legend Igor Gołaszewski became the head coach for the last six games of the season (of which he won five). For the 2014/2015 season the club finished just above relegation, at 14th place out of the 18 teams competing in the Łódź-Mazovia group of the 4th tier of Polish football (the III liga).

==== Jerzy Engel &amp; Co. ====

On 25 June 2015, &quot;Polonia Warszawa S.A.&quot; (under the leadership of Jerzy Engel) took over the senior team from the MKS Polonia Warsaw Academy, which helped to reinstate Polonia Warsaw back from nonexistence, to the bottom-half of the 4th tier (III liga) of professional football in Poland. Under Engel the club returned to the previous emblem and the sponsor from the Polish Title winning season (1999/2000).

The stem of the team from the previous season was kept, Igor Gołaszewski remained as main coach. Wojciech Szymanek, Jacek Kosmalski, and Radosław Majdan all returned to the club as coaching staff. The club signed four experienced offensive players: Kosiorowski, Marczak, Truszkowski, and Obłuski to help Polonia in the promotion fight. &quot;Polonia Warszawa S.A.&quot; at their first press conference also made a strong intent of building a modern General Kazimierz Sosnkowski Municipal Stadium within five years (until 2020), with the goal of returning to the Ekstraklasa in the meantime.

In late 2018, Jerzy Engel resigned as the club did not see much sporting success and the club&#x27;s finances deteriorated. The city authorities were uninterested in collaborating with the clubs shareholders to build a new commercially self-sufficient stadium to stabilise KSP&#x27;s financial troubles, but opted for building a municipal youth centre instead. Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, as one of her last decisions as the president of Warsaw, announced a design contest for the new municipal stadium at Konwiktorska 6 – Polonia&#x27;s homeground, along with 158 mln zł reserved in the 2019 Warsaw budget to kick off the project. In May 2019, the results of the competition were announced with JSK Architekci (who already designed two other major stadiums in Warsaw) as the winners, with a 15,500 seat stadium and an open sports complex project, to be built at Konwiktorska 6.

Meanwhile, Polonia&#x27;s finances crippled, the new chairman Peter Kaluba was unable to bring stability or financial backing to the club, and once again in recent history Polonia found itself on the verge of bankruptcy. To add insult to injury, the vice-president of the city Renata Kaznowska suspended works on the stadium in late 2019. Many players left the club with the final blow dealt during the break of 2020, when much liked coach Krzysztof Chrobak left the club along with the fan favourite footballer Krystian Pieczara – Polonia&#x27;s top scorer of the last decade, the captain and number 10, who followed suit.

==== &quot;Bonjour Grégoire&quot; ====

In mid-February 2020, Polonia&#x27;s rival fans from Legia Warsaw launched media attacks on Grégoire Nitot – the chairman of the IT company Sii Poland, originally from France, who was negotiating a Polonia takeover. As a reaction, the Polish footballing community started an anti-hate campaign called &quot;#BonjourGregoire&quot;, to welcome the support for Polonia. On 5 March 2020, Grégoire Nitot acquired the controlling stake of &quot;Polonia Warszawa S.A.&quot; from Krystyna Bnińska-Jędrzejowicz. On the 19th he was named the chairman, as all of the football came to a halt, due to the Coronavirus pandemic, with Polonia sitting in the relegation zone of the III liga. Wojciech Szymanek remained as coach, and on the 30 of April Piotr Kosiorowski was named as the sporting director, along with the presentation of ambitious plans for the future to reach the Ekstraklasa by 2029. By May 2020, with Polonia sitting in the relegation zone, WMZPN confirmed that no relegations would take place, despite the season coming to an end due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

After normal play resumed and the 2020–2021 season of the III liga ended, Polonia finished in 4th place out of the 22 teams competing in group 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;20/21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Come August 2021, after 64 years, KSP reactivated its women&#x27;s football section. Due to Polonia&#x27;s recognisable brand and long history, this move was seen as an important event in Polish women&#x27;s football in general; Jacek Sękowski from Piastovia Piastów became the team&#x27;s first coach. The &quot;Czarne syrenki&quot; (&quot;Black Mermaids&quot;), as the KSP women&#x27;s football team is known, won their first sparring match with a score of 2:1 against AKS Zły. They continued their success in the league games, winning 6:0 against the reserves of AZS Uniwersytet Warszawski in their inauguration match of the IV liga mazowiecka and followed it up with another high victory of 11:3 against Świt Barcząca.

November 2021 brought Polonia&#x27;s 110th anniversary, which was celebrated boisterously. The club and its ultras produced unique memorabilia for the event whereas the Poczta Polska introduced a special postage stamp for the occasion, which was designed by Agnieszka Sancewicz on fluorescent paper and printed in a circulation of 135,000. Thanks to fan initiatives: a new song was recorded; the Palace of Culture and Science, the National Stadium, and the Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge were illuminated in KSP colours; and messages were displayed on screens throughout Warsaw&#x27;s public transport to remind the capital of its oldest existing club&#x27;s history. Polonia triumphed 2:0 over Wissa Szczuczyn on the main day of the celebrations, ending the autumn round of games in a strong second position of the league table and leaving the fans in an ecstatic mood on the 110th birthday of the &quot;Czarne koszule&quot;.

The Polonia men&#x27;s basketball team secured advancement from the second league to the first after a series of 36 victories in a row and not a single defeat, becoming the only team to do so in the season. The 2021/2022 season brought many more triumphs for the entire club, as the men&#x27;s football team came first in group I of the III liga, finally returning after 5 years to the II liga. The victorious sold-out match between then-group-leader Legionovia Legionowo that finally put KSP in the lead attracted 5000 fans to the home stadium, and many online viewers, who took part in and witnessed a display of Ekstraklasa-level support. Success was also reached by the U12 group, the women&#x27;s football team, and the men&#x27;s reserves – all of whom advanced to higher leagues. In the 2022/2023 season, Polonia Warsaw was officially promoted to the I liga after defeating Olimpia Elbląg 2–0 and securing the title as leaders of the II liga.

== Supporters and rivalries ==
===Friendships===
The friendship between Polonia and KS Cracovia used to be the oldest in Poland (starting in the 1930s); though officially it was ended in 2017 due to disagreements between ultras, friendly relations between the clubs and their supporters persist. Polonia fans have friendships with fans of Sandecja Nowy Sącz and the &quot;Ligallo Fondo Norte&quot; group of Real Zaragoza. The antifa section of Polonia&#x27;s supporters, known as &quot;Black Rebels&quot;, maintained links with antifascist supporters of Partizan Minsk and Arsenal Kyiv.

===Support and notable fans===
The shirt number 12 is reserved for the club&#x27;s supporters.

Famous supporters include Doman Nowakowski, Maciej Dowbor, Jan Englert, Michał Listkiewicz, Stanisław Tym, Kazimierz Górski, Krzysztof Ibisz, Marek Jurek, Grzegorz Jankowski, Wojciech Wysocki, Hanna Śleszyńska, Henryk Chmielewski, and Tomasz Konatkowski. Adam Bahdaj wrote a famous book entitled &quot;Do przerwy 0:1&quot; &quot;(0:1 at half-time)&quot; which centres around local children playing football inspired by Polonia&#x27;s team.

When fascist hooligan groups started becoming a problem in Polish football during the 1990s, some Polonia fans banded together to form an antifascist movement against what was happening on the stands. The first such group was known as &quot;Kibice Polonii przeciw faszyzmowi&quot; (&quot;Polonia Fans Against Fascism&quot;), formed in 1993, and was one of the pioneering of its kind in Poland. There were about 200 people associated with this milieu and they took on the name &quot;Black Rebels&quot; in 2011. In 2013, a series of physical attacks on the Black Rebels were carried out by far-right elements among KSP fans; messages of support for the Black Rebels from ultras and fans of various other clubs out-poured around Europe.

In August 2004, the Polonia fans adopted a black jaguar called Beata from the Warsaw Zoo, and rechristened her &quot;Beata Konwiktorska VI&quot; (a name that resembles the title of a queen as well as being an homage to the street address of the General Kazimierz Sosnkowski Municipal Stadium – 6 Konwiktorska). She lived at the zoo with her partner Kalim, with whom she had 7 cubs and 4 grand-cubs. The animal became a popular club and fan symbol. She was chosen as the most beautiful cat of the Varsovian zoo by internet voters in 2019. Aged 16 years and 9 months, she died on 16 January 2020.

===Warsaw derby===

The main rival is the local team Legia Warsaw with whom they contest the Warsaw derby. For many years, these two teams played in the Ekstraklasa. After Polonia&#x27;s relegation from the Polish top division in 2013, the games of Polonia Warsaw against Legia Warsaw II became a substitute for such matches.

<text>Sir Richard Grey (1457 – 25 June 1483) was an English knight and the half-brother of King Edward V of England.

==Early life==
Richard Grey was the younger son of Sir John Grey of Groby and Elizabeth Woodville. Richard was a 3-year-old child when his father was killed fighting for the House of Lancaster at the Second Battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461. When Richard was 6 his mother married the Yorkist king, Edward IV, in secret, on 1 May 1464. Richard first appeared on the public scene when he took part in the jousts to celebrate the creation of his half-brother Richard as Duke of York in 1474, a feat he repeated at the 4-year old Duke&#x27;s marriage celebrations in 1478 to the 5-year old Anne de Mowbray.

==Knighthood==
Grey was knighted in 1475 and was nominated four times to membership of The Most Noble Order of the Garter between 1476 and 1482. His political role also started in 1475, the year he was knighted, when he began to serve in Wales and the bordering English counties as part of the political rule of the council of his other half-brother, Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward V). Grey served as a justice of the peace in Herefordshire from 1475 and sat at sessions of the peace in Hereford and Ludlow in 1476 and 1477.

==Career as constable==
In 1479, he was appointed constable of Chester Castle and in the same year was considered important enough for the city of Bristol to appeal to him for his aid. He served on a number of other judicial commissions in the region through the remainder of the reign of his stepfather. In 1482, he was granted the Welsh lordship of Kidwelly, and in the same year was given a greater role in the upbringing of the Prince of Wales. Grey had become a very important person in Edward IV&#x27;s rule in Wales and the bordering English counties. Grey was also being given a broader geographic field of activity, serving as constable of Wallingford Castle from 1482 and the following year being granted the Holland manors in Essex and Northamptonshire.

==Imprisonment and execution==
On the death of Edward IV, on 9 April 1483, Grey&#x27;s half-brother became King Edward V. On 30 April 1483, while accompanying Edward V to London from Wales with their uncle Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, Grey was arrested by Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) at Stony Stratford and, with Rivers, imprisoned in the north of England. 

Within a few weeks, Grey&#x27;s lands and offices had been redistributed to others, even though he had not legally been deprived of them. 

After Edward V was declared illegitimate, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, acceded to the throne as Richard III. Grey and his uncle were then executed at Pontefract Castle on 25 June 1483. Richard Grey was aged around 26 at the time of his execution.

<text>Images and Words is the second studio album by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, released on July 7, 1992, through Atco Records. It is the first Dream Theater release to feature James LaBrie on vocals. Since its release, the album has maintained its position as the band&#x27;s most commercially successful studio album, and the song &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; has the distinction of being the only Top 10 hit (radio or otherwise) the band has had to date. This particular song has also had more recent success as it has appeared in the 2008 video game &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;.

==History==
After Charlie Dominici&#x27;s departure from Dream Theater, the band auditioned nearly 200 individuals across the nation, until James LaBrie, who at that point was part of Canadian glam metal band Winter Rose, sent the band an audition tape. After a short jam session, he was named Dream Theater&#x27;s new lead singer, and has remained with them ever since.

With LaBrie as the new vocalist, the band was signed to a seven-album contract by Atco Records, and shortly thereafter, they began recording their new album in late 1991. The album&#x27;s production was marred with tensions, as the band clashed with producer David Prater, including incidents where Prater would lock the band out of the studio while infamously forcing drummer Mike Portnoy to use triggered snare and bass drum samples, with the snare sample being the exact one used on FireHouse&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;, another album Prater produced around the same time.

The lead single, &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, gained the band considerable commercial success with its airplay on MTV and radio, garnering them a top 10 hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. When the album was released, it sold at a steady pace, helped by an extensive world tour.

Dream Theater originally intended to release a double album, but that plan was rejected by ATCO, causing several songs to be omitted from the album. One of these songs, &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;, would later be re-recorded by the band and released on an EP of the same name in 1995.

The song &quot;Take the Time&quot; includes samples from Kurtis Blow&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Rappin&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Hold it now&quot;), Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Dancin&#x27; Fool&quot; (&quot;Wait a minute&quot;), and Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Power to the People&quot;, (&quot;Come on&quot;). The song also features a quote from Giuseppe Tornatore&#x27;s movie Cinema Paradiso: &quot;Ora che ho perso la vista, ci vedo di più&quot; (&quot;Now that I have lost my sight, I see more&quot;), sung and paraphrased by LaBrie shortly before in the song (&quot;I can see much clearer now, I&#x27;m blind&quot;). LaBrie had appeared as a guest vocalist on Fates Warning&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Parallels&quot;, for which the band was credited as &quot;Dream Theatre&quot; in the &quot;special thanks&quot; of the album&#x27;s credits. Dream Theater responded by thanking &quot;Fatez Warning&quot; in the credits of &quot;Images and Words&quot;.

&quot;Images and Words&quot; was played in its entirety on several occasions during the European leg of the 2007 &quot;Chaos in Motion&quot; tour, in celebration of its 15th anniversary. On July 7, 2012, at a concert in Austin, Texas, the songs &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, &quot;Another Day&quot;, and &quot;Metropolis&quot; were performed as an encore to celebrate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary; additionally, &quot;Surrounded&quot; was performed during the main set. In 2017, Dream Theater celebrated the 25th anniversary of the album on the &quot;Images, Words &amp; Beyond&quot; tour in Europe, which started on January 30 at the Auditorium Parco Della Musica in Rome, Italy.

In a 2019 interview with Greg Prato in SongFacts, LaBrie listed &quot;Images and Words&quot; as the Dream Theater album he is most proud of, because &quot;that established what Dream Theater really is. I think it&#x27;s a phenomenal album from beginning to end.&quot;

The album was reissued in 2013 on vinyl as a limited edition 180 gr. double LP.

==Reception==
The album has received acclaim from music critics since its release. The German magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; elected &quot;Images and Words&quot; Album of the Month and lauded Dream Theater, using &quot;the old [1970s] term &#x27;supergroup; according to the reviewer, they set &quot;standards and still perfect them, although they hardly appear to do so&quot; and, even considering the many influences in their music, the &quot;versatility, the linking of different grooves and melody elements within each songs&quot; shows how Dream Theater are &quot;style-transcending like no other band.&quot; In another contemporary review, &quot;Select&quot; gave the album a lower rating, referring to the album as &quot;elaborate, layered prog-metal&quot; and stated that &quot;if this was a book, it&#x27;d be for the coffee-table, glossy but not essential.&quot; Phil Carter of AllMusic was taken by the band members&#x27; &quot;impressive ability on their respective instruments&quot; and by LaBrie&#x27;s vocal range, writing also that the album is an &quot;excellent mix of progressive metal stylings with heartfelt vocals and thought-provoking lyrics&quot;. Metal Storm reviewer calls &quot;Images and Words&quot; &quot;a masterpiece and also a historical album&quot;, because it &quot;brought something totally new to the scene, this famous progressive metal sound that would become Dream Theater&#x27;s signature&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff in his &quot;Collector&#x27;s Guide to Heavy Metal&quot; praised the band&#x27;s musicianship and &quot;the tricky arrangements&quot;, but was not thrilled by the album, which he found &quot;a bit too self-aware and calculated to be in the true spirit of progressive rock.&quot;

&quot;Images and Words&quot; was a moderate commercial hit, reaching number 61 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It is also Dream Theater&#x27;s only album to be certified gold by the RIAA, and remains their best-selling album to date, selling more than six hundred thousand copies.

==Accolades==
On April 9, 2013, &quot;Images and Words&quot; won &quot;Loudwire&quot;&#x27;s fan-voted March Metal Madness award for best metal album of all time.

The song &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot; was awarded the 98th best guitar solo by an About.com guitar expert.

In October 2011, &quot;Images and Words&quot; was ranked number 7 on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1992.

In 2015, the album was ranked first on the website Prog Report&#x27;s list of the top 50 progressive rock albums of 1990–2015. Four other Dream Theater albums made the list: &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; (third), &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; (14th), &quot;Awake&quot; (18th), and &quot;Train of Thought&quot; (38th).

In 2017, it was ranked 95th at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>RTS Widzew Łódź () is a Polish football club based in Łódź. The club was founded in 1910. Its official colours are red and white, hence their nicknames &quot;Czerwona Armia&quot; (Red Army) and &quot;Czerwono-biało-czerwoni&quot; (Red-white-reds). They compete in the Ekstraklasa, the top tier of the Polish football league system, since the 2022-23 season.

==History==
The club was founded in 1910 as &quot;Towarzystwo Miłośników Rozwoju Fizycznego Widzew (Society of Physical Development Fans Widzew)&quot;. Its name comes from the name of the city district Widzew, while RTS stands for Workers&#x27; Sports Association (in Polish &quot;Robotnicze Towarzystwo Sportowe&quot;). The club was founded by Polish workers and German industrialists who were employees of the Widzew textile manufactory called WIMA. Initially, the club was called the Widzew Association for Physical Development (in Polish: Towarzystwo Miłośników Rozwoju Fizycznego Widzew) because at that time Łódź was under the rule of the Russian Tsar and the adjective &quot;workers&#x27;&quot; (in Polish: Robotniczy) could not be used in the club&#x27;s name. The club&#x27;s mottos are Together We Create Power (in Polish &quot;Razem Tworzymy Siłę&quot;) and Always 12 (in Polish &quot;Zawsze w 12&quot;) which is meant to suggest that its fans are the twelfth player on the team. The club plays its matches at its stadium, located in Łódź at 138 Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego Avenue. The stadium bears the unofficial but commonly used name of the Heart of Łódź (in Polish &quot;Serce Łodzi&quot;).

After the First World War, Poland regained its independence and the club was reactivated in 1922 as &quot;Robotnicze Towarzystwo Sportowe Widzew Łódź (Workers&#x27; Sports Association Widzew Łódź).&quot;

During World War II, three pre-war players of Widzew Łódź, Joachim Schreer, Mirosław Wągrowski and Aleksander Żadziłko, were among Poles murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940.

Widzew has won four Polish league championships, in 1980–81, 1981–82, 1995–96 and 1996–97, as well as the 1985 Polish Cup.

After winning back-to-back championships in 1980–81 and 1981–82, Widzew reclaimed the league crown 14 years later after a record season once again. During the successful 1995–96 season, Widzew conceded only 22 goals in 34 matches, the least out of all teams in the league. They were also proficient in attack, scoring 84 goals and securing 88 points across the campaign. Thanks in part to the great performance of their goalkeeper Andrzej Woźniak, the team remained unbeaten for the whole season.

In the following 1996–97 season, the team enjoyed another great season. For the second time in the club&#x27;s history, they secured back-to-back championships, scoring 74 goals across the season and conceding only 21.

They have appeared in 117 matches in European Cups, of which they won 42. Widzew knocked European giants Manchester United out of the 1980–81 UEFA Cup, although their biggest achievement was reaching the semi-final of the 1982–83 European Cup, eliminating then three-time winners Liverpool along the way.

===Recent history===
At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, Widzew was purchased by one of the wealthiest men in Poland, Sylwester Cacek.
In January 2008, while playing in the second division, the Polish Football Association ruled that Widzew Łódź should be relegated due to their involvement in a corruption scandal. However, Widzew became champions that year and were allowed to stay in the second division, which was renamed I liga before the start of the 2008-09 season. Despite being deducted six points as a penalty, Widzew won the I Liga again in the 2009-10 season, and were promoted to the Ekstraklasa. However, Widzew were once again relegated at the end of the 2013–14 season after four seasons.

Due to financial problems, Widzew finished last at the end of the 2014–15 season, and subsequently went bankrupt.
Local businessmen Marcin Ferdzyn and Grzegorz Waranecki decided to take on amateur status as a new association called &quot;Stowarzyszenie Reaktywacja Tradycji Sportowych Widzew Łódź (Association of the Reactivation of the Sports Traditions of Widzew Łódź)&quot;, which continues the tradition of the old RTS Widzew Łódź. The new association was registered in a Polish court on 2 July 2015, and within a few weeks of summer 2015, they managed to hire a new coach Witold Obarek and gather a new roster, which started the 2015–16 season in the fifth tier of Polish football. In their first season in IV liga, Widzew won promotion. In the 2016–17 season, Widzew achieved third place in III liga, behind Drwęca Nowe Miasto Lubawskie and ŁKS Łódź, but next season yielded promotion to II liga. In the 2018–19 season, they finished in fifth place with 55 points. In the 2021–22 season, Widzew finished 2nd, one point ahead of Arka Gdynia, and returned to Ekstraklasa for the first time since the 2013–14 season.

==Stadium==
The club&#x27;s home stadium was the Municipal Stadium () opened in 1930. The stadium, which was owned by the city of Łódź, had a capacity of 10,500 seats. In early 2015, it was demolished to make way for a new stadium with 18,000 seats. It was intended the new stadium will be completed by November 2016.

In the 2014–15 season, Widzew played their home matches in Byczyna near Poddębice, 40 km west of Łódź.

After bankruptcy and relegation to the fifth division, a rebuilt team was forced to play its domestic games in Łódź at UKS SMS Łódź stadium, during the construction of a new Widzew Łódź Stadium.

The first match at their new stadium was played on the 18th March, 2017, where Widzew won against Motor Lubawa 2–0. 17,443 fans attended the game.

==Fans==

Widzew has one of the largest fan-bases in Poland with fan-clubs all around the country. Widzew&#x27;s biggest rival is ŁKS Łódź, with whom they contest the Łódź Derby. Legia Warsaw are also big rivals, with whom they contest the &quot;Derby of Poland&quot;, which stems from the fact there were frequent title races between the two clubs. GKS Bełchatów is third biggest rival of Widzew. Their fans maintain friendly relations with fans of Ruch Chorzów, Elana Toruń, KKS Kalisz, Wisła Kraków. A little group of ultras has a friendship with Hungarian side Honvéd, due to the Hungary–Poland relations.

<text>Kolejowy Klub Sportowy Lech Poznań S.A., commonly referred to as KKS Lech Poznań or simply Lech Poznań (), is a Polish professional football club based in Poznań and currently competing in the Ekstraklasa, the nation&#x27;s highest division.

The club was established on 19 March 1922 as &quot;KS Lutnia Dębiec&quot;, later changing its name several times. Until 1994, the club was closely linked to Polish State Railways (PKP). As a result, its popular nickname is Kolejorz , which means The Railwayman in local slang. The club&#x27;s debut in the Polish top division took place in the year 1948. The brightest era of Lech was in the early 1980s and early 1990s. Lech has won the Polish league a total of eight times, most recently in 2022, and is the most popular football club in the Greater Poland region.

== Names ==
==History==
===Formation and early years (1920–1945)===
In August 1920, a group of young teenagers from the Catholic Youth Association decided to split off and form their own football team. The founders of the club were: Jan Nowak, Antoni Dyzman, Jan Dyzman, Leon Nowicki, Józef Magdziak, Kazimierz Zmuda, Stanisław Nowicki, Stefan Fiedler, Józef Gośliński, Leon Stachowski, Józef Blumreder and Jan Wojtek. The origin of Lech can be traced back to 19 March 1922, when it was officially registered as a football club. The club&#x27;s first official name was Towarzystwo Sportowe Liga Dębiec. In September 1922 the club gained a football pitch on Grzybowa street. The first match for the club was played in May 1922 against Urania Starołęka, which ended in a 1–1 draw. The club started its foundation in a low tier league, which at the time was the Class C.

The club achieved promotion in 1928 to the Class B after six years of being in Class C. In 1932 the club was promoted to Class A where the biggest teams of the region played. From there they could get promoted to the First National Division, but the club would not achieve that goal before the outbreak of World War II. In autumn of 1933 the Klub Sportowy Kolejowego Przysposobienia Wojskowego Poznań (&quot;Poznań Military Training Railway Sports Club&quot;) was founded or KPW. In 1945, shortly after the war ended, sporting officials made Lech the first club from the city.

===Downfall and the Miracle of Błażejewko (1947–1979)===
In 1947, the Polish Football Association (PZPN) decided to create the first national division (Ekstraklasa). At first, the club was not admitted to the top flight, but the Kolejorz (&quot;the railwayman&quot;, the popular nickname of the club) filed an appeal and the PZPN decided, in a special meeting, to extend the First Division to 14 teams, including the KKS (at that time called Kolejowy Klub Sportowy Poznań) and Widzew Łódź. The first match was against Widzew Łódź, lost 3–4.

The club changed its name again in January 1957, this time to Klub Sportowy Lech Poznań and in December to Kolejowy Klub Sportowy Lech Poznań, which lasted throughout the history of the team. That same year turned out to be one of the worst for the club, since it finished last and was relegated to the second division. Lech only gained twelve points in 22 games, despite having striker Teodor Anioła, the club&#x27;s top scorer, with 141 goals and top scorer of the Polish championship in three consecutive editions (1949–1951). Along with Edmund Białas and Henryk Czapczyk, Anioła formed the famous trio known as ABC. During that period, the club managed to finish third in the top division twice, as the best result, before its relegation to second division.

Lech managed to return to the top division in 1961, but after two seasons with poor results, the blue team was relegated again in 1963. The club was even demoted to the third division, then known as the Interprovincial Division (Liga międzywojewódzka), in one of the biggest sports crisis of the organization. In 1972 the club returned to the first division, in which they had to fight again to avoid relegation every season. Coach Jerzy Kopa, who arrived from Szombierki Bytom, was responsible for reviving Lech spectacularly. He took over the team in 1976, when they were bottom of the table. Kopa gathered players at a training camp in Błażejewko, saved the team from relegation and twelve months later qualified for the first time to play in Europe after finishing third in the league, just two points behind the champion, Wisła Kraków. Therefore, this transformation became known as The Miracle of Błażejewko. The club&#x27;s first participation in the UEFA Cup in 1978–79 was brief, as they were eliminated in the first round by MSV Duisburg.

===Golden age of Lech (1980–1993)===
The arrival of coach Wojciech Łazarek in 1980 at the club was key to overcome third place and European participation. That year the team reached the final of the Polish Cup for the first time, losing 0–5 to Legia Warsaw in Częstochowa. Two years later, the club managed to win the first title in its history, the Polish Cup, by defeating Pogoń Szczecin 1–0 in Wrocław.
The league championships of 1983 and 1984 went down in history as they were the first two league titles of the Kolejorz and for winning on such tight margins against Widzew Łódź. The first league championship for Lech was a point of advantage (39) over Widzew (38). The 15 goals scored by the top scorer of the tournament, Mirosław Okoński and the participation of other players like Krzysztof Pawlak and Józef Adamiec were very important to win their first league championship. Meanwhile, the championship of the following season both teams staged an exciting tournament and tied at 42 points. Lech defended championship by having a better difference of goals than Widzew to break the tie. That season was historic for the blue team, as they got their first double by becoming champions of the Polish Cup, after winning in the final at Wisła Kraków (3–0).

As Polish champions, Lech participated for the first time in the European Cup, although they could not pass the first round in the two seasons. In its first season it was eliminated by Athletic Club. In the first leg in Poland, Mariusz Niewiadomski and Mirosław Okoński scored the first two Lech goals in the tournament and the team won 2–0. However, the return match in San Mamés was a nightmare for the Poles and the Spanish team qualified by winning 4–0. The following season the team faced the current champion, Liverpool F.C., who won by a 5–0 aggregate.

In 1988, Lech won another Cup by beating Legia in Łódź in the penalty shootout. In the second round of the European Cup, Lech faced Barcelona, coached by Johan Cruyff. After finishing the two games in a 1–1 draw, Barcelona, in the end the tournament, could only eliminate Lech in the penalty shootout.

Jerzy Kopa returned to Lech in 1990 along with Andrzej Strugarek and Kolejorz returned to be proclaimed league champions for the third time. Andrzej Juskowiak was the top scorer of the tournament with 18 goals and his team finished with 42 points, two more than the runner-up, Zagłębie Lubin. Henryk Apostel, however, was the coach who led Lech to two new championships in 1992 and 1993. The first one was achieved with a win over GKS Katowice, while the second one tied in points with the second team, Legia, and only won because Legia was penalized for disputed match fixing. 
In the autumn of 1990, Lech played one of the most spectacular qualifiers of the last decade in the European Cup. At Bułgarska street stadium the Polish club defeated Olympique Marseille 3–2 in the first leg of the second round. The return match at the Stade Vélodrome, the French team, thrashed Lech 6–1, in a match in which most of the Polish players complained of food poisoning. Since 1993 the club entered into a major financial crisis and had to sell its most important players to continue in professional football.

===New disappointments and successes (1994–present)===
Lech managed to stay in the middle of the table and their best result was fourth place in 1999, which allowed him to play in the 1999–00 UEFA Cup, where they eliminated Liepājas Metalurgs in the qualifying round and were defeated by IFK Göteborg in the first round. However, just a few months later, in 2000, Lech was relegated to the second division after 28 years of presence in the top flight. Lech&#x27;s first season in the second division was a disaster, as they were very close to falling to the third division. It was only with a great effort that the club was saved from relegation and even won the promotion the next season to the first division.
In their first year of the return to the I league (2002–03) Lech focused on ensuring permanence. The following season began with a very negative dynamic for the Kolejorz. After five days, the club hired a new coach, Czesław Michniewicz. The unexpected appointment of the young coach turned out to be a shock, since Lech finished the season in sixth position. Most important, however, was the conquest of a Polish Cup by defeating their great rival, Legia Warsaw, in the final two games in 2004. Several days later, the fans in Poznań celebrated the victory of Lech in the Super Cup against Wisła Kraków. Although the next two seasons did not bring any success of that proportion, Lech managed to finish at the top of the table of each season with coach Franciszek Smuda.
Smuda formed a strong team with the arrival at the club of players like Robert Lewandowski, Hernan Rengifo, Semir Štilić, Marcin Zając and Rafał Murawski. In the Ekstraklasa 2008–09 season, Lech had a great season and finished in third place and qualified for the UEFA Europa League thanks, in part, to the 14 goals scored by Robert Lewandowski. On 19 May 2009, Lech won the Cup for the fifth time by beating Ruch Chorzów with a solo goal by Sławomir Peszko at Stadion Śląski.

The following season, Jacek Zieliński replaced Franciszek Smuda, who was hired as the manager of the Poland national team. With many of the players who achieved third place and the cup last season, Zieliński managed to lead Lech to the sixth championship in their history in the 2009–10 season. The striker Robert Lewandowski returned to be a reference in attack and was top scorer of the championship with 18 goals. In their participation in the 2010–11 Champions League, they were eliminated by Sparta Prague in the third round and without Lewandowski, who was transferred to Borussia Dortmund. One of their most successful European appearance was in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League, in which they eliminated Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk to enter the group stage of the tournament for the first time. Lech finished second in their group with Manchester City, leaving Juventus and FC Salzburg out of the tournament. However, they were eliminated by S.C. Braga, runner-up of the tournament months later, in the round of 32 after winning in Poland (1–0) and losing in Portugal (2–0).

In the 2021–22 season, during which Lech celebrated its 100th anniversary, the team led by Maciej Skorża finished runners-up in the Polish Cup, losing 3–1 against Raków Częstochowa, and won the club&#x27;s eighth championship, their first in seven years.

Skorża left the team shortly after, citing personal reasons, and was replaced by Dutchman John van den Brom for the 2022–23 season. Lech crashed out of the UEFA Champions League first qualifying round after losing to Azerbaijani side Qarabağ 1–5 on aggregate. The team went on to have a successful UEFA Europa Conference League campaign, reaching second place in the group stage which included Villarreal, Austria Wien and Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva, then eliminating Nordic teams Bodø/Glimt and Djurgårdens IF to reach the quarter-finals, where their successful run ended after a 4–6 defeat on aggregate to Fiorentina. They were the first Polish team to win a knockout phase round of a European competition that took place after the winter break since Legia Warsaw in 1991, and the first to move through two post-winter rounds since Górnik Zabrze in 1970.

The following 2023–24 campaign was marked by disappointment. Lech failed to progress past the third qualifying round of the Europa Conference League, losing to Slovak side Spartak Trnava 3–4 on aggregate, despite winning the first game at home 2–1. In December 2023, trailing in the league by eight points by the winter break, van den Brom was dismissed and replaced with Mariusz Rumak, returning to the role after nine-and-a-half years. Lech&#x27;s form did not improve under Rumak; they were unable to take the lead in the table, lost to lower-placed teams Puszcza Niepołomice and Ruch Chorzów, and were eliminated from the 2023–24 Polish Cup after conceding in the 119th minute of a quarter-final match against Pogoń Szczecin. Still in title contention with three games to go, Lech finished the season in 5th after losing at home to Korona Kielce on 25 May, hours after their reserve team was demoted to the fourth division, allowing Korona to stay in the top-flight in lieu of Lech&#x27;s neighbors Warta.

In the group stage, Lech finished third-placed ahead of Nancy and Feyenoord to secure a place in the Third Round, where it was knocked out by the Italian side Udinese.

Their home ground Stadion Poznań has been totally rebuilt and completed in September 2010 for UEFA Euro 2012, during which it is expected to host 3 games in Group C.

The 2010–11 European campaign saw Lech not only qualify for the group stage of the Europa League, but also progress from the group stage ahead of Italian giants Juventus, before losing at the Round of 32 to eventual finalists Braga. In the 2022–23 season, Lech reached their first ever European quarter-final at the Conference League, losing to Italian club Fiorentina.

==Stadiums==
===Dębiec Stadium===
Initially the club&#x27;s first stadium was located in the Dębiec district between two train tracks. It belonged to PKP (the Polish state railways) and was demolished in 2013 after a long period of inactivity.

===Edmund Szyc Stadium===

Edmund Szyc Stadium is a currently ruined multi-purpose stadium in the Wilda district, named after Edmund Szyc, one of founders of Warta Poznań. It is the historical home of the other football team Warta Poznań, but Lech played there sporadically between the 1950s and 1970s.

===Stadion Poznań===

The Stadion Poznań is the home ground of Lech Poznań, and was one of the venues for the group phase of Euro 2012. It has a league capacity of 42,837 (all seated). The stadium was originally built between 1968 and 1980. From its inauguration in August 1980 Lech Poznań has used the ground as its main venue; since 2010 it has also been used by Warta Poznań, which currently plays in . The ground is situated on the street &quot;ul. Bułgarska 17&quot; in the southwestern part of the city (Grunwald district).

In the years 2003–10 the stadium underwent a complete reconstruction, including the building of four new fully covered stands. Currently it is the fifth largest stadium in Poland (after Kazimierz Górski National Stadium, Silesia Stadium, The Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw and PGE Arena Gdańsk) and third largest in Ekstraklasa (after the latter two). The grand opening after final renovation took place on 20 September 2010, with Sting&#x27;s &quot;Symphonicity Tour&quot; concert.

==Fans==
Lech Poznań is considered to have one of the strongest fan support in Poland due to the club&#x27;s high average attendance in the Ekstraklasa and the atmosphere during the games.

Lech&#x27;s fanbase is mainly located in the Greater Poland region, with fan clubs in many other towns.

===Friendships and rivalries===
For over a decade Lech supporters have a fellowship with fans from Arka Gdynia and KS Cracovia sometimes called the &quot;Wielka Triada&quot; or &quot;The Great Triad&quot;. Close friendship links Lech fans also with KSZO Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski and ŁKS Łódź supporters. Among the more ardent element of supporters, there are some private contacts with Fratria, fans of Spartak Moscow, and Crveni Đavoli, fans of Radnički Kragujevac from Serbia.

The biggest rival is Legia Warsaw with whom they contest the &quot;Derby of Poland&quot;. Wisła Kraków, Lechia Gdańsk and Śląsk Wrocław are also big rivals due to the fans friendship with Arka and Cracovia, similarly Korona Kielce are disliked due to the friendship with KSZO and Widzew Łódź due to ŁKS. Other teams that can be considered rivals are Ruch Chorzów and Pogoń Szczecin. In past the &quot;Greater Poland derby&quot; was played against regional rivals Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski before their decline.

Relations with local rival Warta Poznań are neutral as the clubs have almost always played in different leagues and many fans attend matches of both teams.

===The Poznań===

The fans&#x27; goal celebration involving the turning of their backs to the pitch, joining arms and jumping up and down in unison—originated in 1961. It is known in the English speaking world as &quot;The Poznan&quot; after Manchester City began using the celebration following their clash with Lech Poznań in the group stages of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. Also popular with fans of Scottish club Celtic who call their version &quot;The Huddle&quot;, in homage to the team&#x27;s pre-match ritual of a huddle before every game kicks off.

===Rap music===
Many Polish rappers who hail from Poznań have been strongly linked to the Lech supporter scene and the club prominently features in their music. Peja was an ardent supporter since he was 15 years old, and was active in the hooligan scene in the 90s. Evtis, Ascetoholix, Bzyk and DJ Decks are all prominent supporters. The fans have produced recorded and released two rap CD&#x27;s called &quot;Definicja Kibol&quot; and &quot;Definicja Kibol 2&quot; as compilation of various artists.

<doc id="677641" wikidata="Q239344" url="?curid=677641" title="Salt March">
<text>The Salt march, also known as the Salt Satyagraha, Dandi March, and the Dandi Satyagraha, was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial India, led by Mahatma Gandhi. The 24-day march lasted from 12 March 1930 to 6 April 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly. Another reason for this march was that the Civil Disobedience Movement needed a strong inauguration that would inspire more people to follow Gandhi&#x27;s example. Gandhi started this march with 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march spanned , from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, which was called Navsari at that time (now in the state of Gujarat). Growing numbers of Indians joined them along the way. When Gandhi broke the British Raj salt laws at 8:30 am on 6 April 1930, it sparked large-scale acts of civil disobedience against the salt laws by millions of Indians.

After making the salt by evaporation at Dandi, Gandhi continued southward along the coast, making salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned to stage a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, south of Dandi. However, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4–5 May 1930, just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing Dharasana Satyagraha drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi&#x27;s release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference. Although over 60,000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha, the British did not make immediate major concessions.

The Salt Satyagraha campaign was based upon Gandhi&#x27;s principles of non-violent protest called &quot;satyagraha&quot;, which he loosely translated as &quot;truth-force&quot;. Literally, it is formed from the Sanskrit words &quot;satya&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, and &quot;agraha&quot;, &quot;insistence&quot;. In early 1920 the Indian National Congress chose satyagraha as their main tactic for winning Indian sovereignty and self-rule from British rule and appointed Gandhi to organise the campaign. Gandhi chose the 1882 British Salt Act as the first target of satyagraha. The Salt March to Dandi, and the beating by the colonial police of hundreds of nonviolent protesters in Dharasana, which received worldwide news coverage, demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting against social and political injustice. The satyagraha teachings of Gandhi and the March to Dandi had a significant influence on American activists Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and others during the Civil Rights Movement for civil rights for African Americans and other minority groups in the 1960s. The march was the most significant organised challenge to British authority since the Non-cooperation movement of 1920–22, and directly followed the Purna Swaraj declaration of sovereignty and self-rule by the Indian National Congress on 26 January 1930 by celebrating Independence Day. It gained worldwide attention which gave impetus to the Indian independence movement and started the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement which continued until 1934 in Gujarat.

== Civil disobedience movement ==
At midnight on 31 December 1929, the INC (Indian National Congress) raised the triple color flag of India on the banks of the Ravi at Lahore. The Indian National Congress, led by Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, publicly issued the Declaration of Sovereignty and Self-rule, or Purna Swaraj, on 26 January 1930. (Meaning &quot;purna&quot;, &quot;complete&quot;, &quot;swa&quot;, &quot;self&quot;, &quot;raj&quot;, &quot;rule&quot;, so therefore &quot;complete self-rule&quot;) The declaration included the readiness to withhold taxes, and the statement:

We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities for growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually. We believe, therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain &quot;Purna Swaraj&quot; or complete sovereignty and self-rule.

The Congress Working Committee gave Gandhi the responsibility for organising the first act of civil disobedience, with Congress itself ready to take charge after Gandhi&#x27;s expected arrest. Gandhi&#x27;s plan was to begin civil disobedience with a satyagraha aimed at the British salt tax. The 1882 Salt Act gave the British a monopoly on the collection and manufacture of salt, limiting its handling to government salt depots and levying a salt tax. Violation of the Salt Act was a criminal offence. Even though salt was freely available to those living on the coast (by evaporation of sea water), Indians were forced to buy it from the colonial government.

==Choice of salt as protest focus==
Initially, Gandhi&#x27;s choice of the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru and Divyalochan Sahu were ambivalent; Sardar Patel suggested a land revenue boycott instead. &quot;The Statesman&quot;, a prominent newspaper, wrote about the choice: &quot;It is difficult not to laugh, and we imagine that will be the mood of most thinking Indians.&quot;

The British colonial administration too was not disturbed by these plans of resistance against the salt tax. The Viceroy himself, Lord Irwin, did not take the threat of a salt protest seriously, writing to London, &quot;At present, the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.&quot;

However, Gandhi had sound reasons for his decision. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights. The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.
Explaining his choice, Gandhi said, &quot;Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life.&quot; In contrast to the other leaders, the prominent Congress statesman and future Governor-General of India, C. Rajagopalachari, understood Gandhi&#x27;s viewpoint. In a public meeting at Tuticorin, he said:

Suppose, a people rise in revolt. They cannot attack the abstract constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes ... Civil disobedience has to be directed against the salt tax or the land tax or some other particular point – not that; that is our final end, but for the time being it is our aim, and we must shoot straight.

Gandhi felt that this protest would dramatise Purna Swaraj in a way that was meaningful to every Indian. He also reasoned that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally.

After the protest gathered steam, the leaders realised the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, &quot;it seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released.&quot;

==Satyagraha==

Gandhi had a long-standing commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience, which he termed &quot;satyagraha&quot;, as the basis for achieving Indian sovereignty and self-rule. Referring to the relationship between &quot;Satyagraha&quot; and &quot;Purna Swaraj&quot;, Gandhi saw &quot;an inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree&quot;. He wrote, &quot;If the means employed are impure, the change will not be in the direction of progress but very likely in the opposite. Only a change brought about in our political condition by pure means can lead to real progress.&quot;

Satyagraha is a synthesis of the Sanskrit words &quot;Satya&quot; (truth) and &quot;Agraha&quot; (insistence on). For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere &quot;passive resistance&quot; and became strength in practicing nonviolent methods. In his words:

Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase &quot;passive resistance&quot;, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word &quot;satyagraha&quot; ...

His first significant attempt in India at leading mass satyagraha was the non-cooperation movement from 1920 to 1922. Even though it succeeded in raising millions of Indians in protest against the British-created Rowlatt Act, violence broke out at Chauri Chaura, where a mob killed 22 unarmed policemen. Gandhi suspended the protest, against the opposition of other Congress members. He decided that Indians were not yet ready for successful nonviolent resistance. The Bardoli Satyagraha in 1928 was much more successful. It succeeded in paralysing the British government and winning significant concessions. More importantly, due to extensive press coverage, it scored a propaganda victory out of all proportion to its size. Gandhi later claimed that success at Bardoli confirmed his belief in satyagraha and Swaraj: &quot;It is only gradually that we shall come to know the importance of the victory gained at Bardoli ... Bardoli has shown the way and cleared it. Swaraj lies on that route, and that alone is the cure ...&quot; Gandhi recruited heavily from the Bardoli Satyagraha participants for the Dandi march, which passed through many of the same villages that took part in the Bardoli protests. This revolt gained momentum and had support from all parts of India.

==Preparing to march==
On 5 February, newspapers reported that Gandhi would begin civil disobedience by defying the salt laws. The salt satyagraha would begin on 12 March and end in Dandi with Gandhi breaking the Salt Act on 6 April. Gandhi chose 6 April to launch the mass breaking of the salt laws for a symbolic reasonit was the first day of &quot;National Week&quot;, begun in 1919 when Gandhi conceived of the national hartal (strike) against the Rowlatt Act.

Gandhi prepared the worldwide media for the march by issuing regular statements from the Ashram, at his regular prayer meetings, and through direct contact with the press. Expectations were heightened by his repeated statements anticipating arrest, and his increasingly dramatic language as the hour approached: &quot;We are entering upon a life and death struggle, a holy war; we are performing an all-embracing sacrifice in which we wish to offer ourselves as an oblation.&quot; Correspondents from dozens of Indian, European, and American newspapers, along with film companies, responded to the drama and began covering the event.

For the march itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest discipline and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, but from the residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi&#x27;s strict standards of discipline. The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening&#x27;s stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based on the needs of the local residents. Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.

On 2 March 1930 Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, offering to stop the march if Irwin met eleven demands, including reduction of land revenue assessments, cutting military spending, imposing a tariff on foreign cloth, and abolishing the salt tax. His strongest appeal to Irwin regarded the salt tax:

If my letter makes no appeal to your heart, on the eleventh day of this month I shall proceed with such co-workers of the Ashram as I can take, to disregard the provisions of the Salt Laws. I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man&#x27;s standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.

As mentioned earlier, the Viceroy held any prospect of a &quot;salt protest&quot; in disdain. After he ignored the letter and refused to meet with Gandhi, the march was set in motion. Gandhi remarked, &quot;On bended knees, I asked for bread and I have received stone instead.&quot; The eve of the march brought thousands of Indians to Sabarmati to hear Gandhi speak at the regular evening prayer. American academic writing for The Nation reported that &quot;60,000 persons gathered on the bank of the river to hear Gandhi&#x27;s call to arms. This call to arms was perhaps the most remarkable call to war that has ever been made.&quot;

==March to Dandi==

On 12 March 1930, Gandhi and 78 satyagrahis, among whom were men belonging to almost every region, caste, creed, and religion of India, set out on foot for the coastal village of Dandi in Navsari district of Gujarat, 385 km from their starting point at Sabarmati Ashram. The Salt March was also called the White Flowing River because all the people were joining the procession wearing white Khadi.

According to &quot;The Statesman&quot;, the official government newspaper which usually played down the size of crowds at Gandhi&#x27;s functions, 100,000 people crowded the road that separated Sabarmati from Ahmedabad. The first day&#x27;s march of 21 km ended in the village of Aslali, where Gandhi spoke to a crowd of about 4,000. At Aslali, and the other villages that the march passed through, volunteers collected donations, registered new satyagrahis, and received resignations from village officials who chose to end co-operation with British rule.

As they entered each village, crowds greeted the marchers, beating drums and cymbals. Gandhi gave speeches attacking the salt tax as inhuman, and the salt satyagraha as a &quot;poor man&#x27;s struggle&quot;. Each night they slept in the open. The only thing that was asked of the villagers was food and water to wash with. Gandhi felt that this would bring the poor into the struggle for sovereignty and self-rule, necessary for eventual victory.

Thousands of satyagrahis and leaders like Sarojini Naidu joined him. Every day, more and more people joined the march, until the procession of marchers became at least 3 km long. To keep up their spirits, the marchers used to sing the Hindu Bhajan Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram while walking. At Surat, they were greeted by 30,000 people. When they reached the railhead at Dandi, more than 50,000 were gathered. Gandhi gave interviews and wrote articles along the way. Foreign journalists and three Bombay cinema companies shooting newsreel footage turned Gandhi into a household name in Europe and America (at the end of 1930, &quot;Time&quot; magazine made him &quot;Man of the Year&quot;). The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote almost daily about the Salt March, including two front-page articles on 6 and 7 April. Near the end of the march, Gandhi declared, &quot;I want world sympathy in this battle of right against might.&quot;

Upon arriving at the seashore on 5 April, Gandhi was interviewed by an Associated Press reporter. He stated:
I cannot withhold my compliments from the government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march ... I wish I could believe this non-interference was due to any real change of heart or policy. The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation I can put upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though it is, is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent ... It remains to be seen whether the Government will tolerate as they have tolerated the march, the actual breach of the salt laws by countless people from tomorrow.

The following morning, after a prayer, Gandhi raised a lump of salty mud and declared, &quot;With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire.&quot; He then boiled it in seawater, producing illegal salt. He implored his thousands of followers to likewise begin making salt along the seashore, &quot;wherever it is convenient&quot; and to instruct villagers in making illegal, but necessary, salt. The others followed him and Sarojini Naidu addressing Gandhi, shouted &#x27;Hail, law breaker.&#x27; In a letter to her daughter, Naidu remarked:&quot;The little law breaker is sitting in a state of &#x27;Maun&#x27; [silence] writing his article of triumph for Young India and I am stretched on a hard bench at the open window of a huge room that has 6 windows open to the sea breeze. As far as the eye can see there is a little Armythousands of pilgrims who have been pouring in since yesterday to this otherwise deserted and exceedingly primitive village of fishermen.&quot;After the Gandhi broke the salt laws, about 700 telegrams were sent out from the post office nearest to Dandi, at Jalalpur. Most of them were by the journalists, who were there to break this news.

==First 78 Marchers==
78 marchers accompanied Gandhi on his march. Most of them were between the ages of 20 and 30. These men hailed from almost all parts of the country. The march gathered more people as it gained momentum, but the following list of names consists of Gandhi himself and the first 78 marchers who were with Gandhi from the beginning of the Dandi March until the end. Most of them simply dispersed after the march was over.

A memorial has been created inside the campus of IIT Bombay honouring these Satyagrahis who participated in the famous Dandi March.

==Mass civil disobedience==

Mass civil disobedience spread throughout India as millions broke the salt laws by making salt or buying illegal salt. Salt was sold illegally all over the coast of India. A pinch of salt made by Gandhi himself sold for 1,600 rupees (equivalent to $750 at the time). In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people by the end of the month.

What had begun as a Salt Satyagraha quickly grew into a mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Bombay, Mysore and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, including censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.

There were outbreaks of violence in Calcutta (now spelled Kolkata), Karachi, and Gujarat. Unlike his suspension of satyagraha after violence broke out during the Non-co-operation movement, this time Gandhi was &quot;unmoved&quot;. Appealing for violence to end, at the same time Gandhi honoured those killed in Chittagong and congratulated their parents &quot;for the finished sacrifices of their sons ... A warrior&#x27;s death is never a matter for sorrow.&quot;

During the first phase of the Indian civil disobedience movement from 1929 to 1931, the second MacDonald ministry headed by Ramsay MacDonald was in power in Britain. The attempted suppression of the movement was presided over by MacDonald and his cabinet (including the Secretary of State for India, William Wedgwood Benn). During this period, the MacDonald ministry also oversaw the suppression of the nascent trade unionist movement in India, which was described by historian Sumit Sarkar as &quot;a massive capitalist and government counter-offensive&quot; against workers&#x27; rights.

===Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre===


In Peshawar, satyagraha was led by a Muslim Pashtun disciple of Gandhi, Ghaffar Khan, who had trained 50,000 nonviolent activists called Khudai Khidmatgar. On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar&#x27;s Qissa Kahani (Storytellers) Bazaar. The 2/18 battalion of the Royal Garhwal Rifles were ordered to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200–250 people. The Pashtun satyagrahis acted in accord with their training in nonviolence, willingly facing bullets as the troops fired on them. One British Indian Army soldier, Chandra Singh Garhwali and some other troops from the renowned Royal Garhwal Rifles regiment refused to fire at the crowds. The entire platoon was arrested and many received heavy sentences, including life imprisonment.

===Vedaranyam salt march===
While Gandhi marched along India&#x27;s west coast, his close associate C. Rajagopalachari, who would later become India&#x27;s first Indian Governor-General, organized the Vedaranyam salt march in parallel on the east coast. His group started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to the coastal village of Vedaranyam. After making illegal salt there, he too was arrested by the British.

===Women in civil disobedience===
The civil disobedience in 1930 marked the first time women became mass participants in the struggle for freedom. Thousands of women, from large cities to small villages, became active participants in satyagraha. Gandhi had asked that only men take part in the salt march, but eventually women began manufacturing and selling salt throughout India. It was clear that though only men were allowed within the march, that both men and women were expected to forward work that would help dissolve the salt laws. Usha Mehta, an early Gandhian activist, remarked that &quot;Even our old aunts and great-aunts and grandmothers used to bring pitchers of salt water to their houses and manufacture illegal salt. And then they would shout at the top of their voices: &#x27;We have broken the salt law!&#x27;&quot; The growing number of women in the fight for sovereignty and self-rule was a &quot;new and serious feature&quot; according to Lord Irwin. A government report on the involvement of women stated &quot;thousands of them emerged ... from the seclusion of their homes ... in order to join Congress demonstrations and assist in picketing: and their presence on these occasions made the work the police was required to perform particularly unpleasant.&quot; Though women did become involved in the march, it was clear that Gandhi saw women as still playing a secondary role within the movement, but created the beginning of a push for women to be more involved in the future.

&quot;Sarojini Naidu was among the most visible leaders (male or female) of pre-independent India. As president of the Indian National Congress and the first woman governor of free India, she was a fervent advocate for India, avidly mobilizing support for the Indian independence movement. She was also the first woman to be arrested in the salt march.&quot;

===Impact===
British documents show that the British government was shaken by Satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused about whether or not to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, an Indian Imperial Police officer from England, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.

==Dharasana Satyagraha and aftermath==
Gandhi himself avoided further active involvement after the march, though he stayed in close contact with the developments throughout India. He created a temporary ashram near Dandi. From there, he urged women followers in Bombay (now Mumbai) to picket liquor shops and foreign cloth. He said that &quot;a bonfire should be made of foreign cloth. Schools and colleges should become empty.&quot;

For his next major action, Gandhi decided on a raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 40 km south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was sleeping on a cot in a mango grove, the District magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables. He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona (now Pune).

The Dharasana Satyagraha went ahead as planned, with Abbas Tyabji, a seventy-six-year-old retired judge, leading the march with Gandhi&#x27;s wife Kasturba at his side. Both were arrested before reaching Dharasana and sentenced to three months in prison. After their arrests, the march continued under the leadership of Sarojini Naidu, a woman poet and freedom fighter, who warned the satyagrahis, &quot;You must not use any violence under any circumstances. You will be beaten, but you must not resist: you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows.&quot; Soldiers began clubbing the satyagrahis with steel tipped lathis in an incident that attracted international attention. United Press correspondent Webb Miller reported that:

Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on unprotected skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down ... Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance ... They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police ... The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.
Vithalbhai Patel, former Speaker of the Assembly, watched the beatings and remarked, &quot;All hope of reconciling India with the British Empire is lost forever.&quot; Miller&#x27;s first attempts at telegraphing the story to his publisher in England were censored by the British telegraph operators in India. Only after threatening to expose British censorship was his story allowed to pass. The story appeared in 1,350 newspapers throughout the world and was read into the official record of the United States Senate by Senator John J. Blaine.

Salt Satyagraha succeeded in drawing the attention of the world. Millions saw the newsreels showing the march. &quot;Time&quot; declared Gandhi its 1930 Man of the Year, comparing Gandhi&#x27;s march to the sea &quot;to defy Britain&#x27;s salt tax as some New Englanders once defied a British tea tax&quot;. Civil disobedience continued until early 1931, when Gandhi was finally released from prison to hold talks with Irwin. It was the first time the two held talks on equal terms, and resulted in the Gandhi–Irwin Pact. The talks would lead to the Second Round Table Conference at the end of 1931.

==Long-term effect==

The Salt Satyagraha did not produce immediate progress toward dominion status or self-rule for India, did not elicit major policy concessions from the British, or attract much Muslim support. Congress leaders decided to end satyagraha as official policy in 1934, and Nehru and other Congress members drifted further apart from Gandhi, who withdrew from Congress to concentrate on his Constructive Programme, which included his efforts to end untouchability in the Harijan movement. However, even though British authorities were again in control by the mid-1930s, Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly began to recognise the legitimacy of claims by Gandhi and the Congress Party for sovereignty and self-rule. The Satyagraha campaign of the 1930s also forced the British to recognise that their control of India depended entirely on the consent of the Indians – Salt Satyagraha was a significant step in the British losing that consent.

Nehru considered the Salt Satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi, and felt that its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:

Of course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses ... Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance ... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole ... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi&#x27;s leadership, must have the credit for it.

More than thirty years later, Satyagraha and the March to Dandi exercised a strong influence on American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., and his fight for civil rights for blacks in the 1960s:

Like most people, I had heard of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was particularly moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (&quot;Satya&quot; is truth which equals love, and &quot;agraha&quot; is force; &quot;Satyagraha&quot;, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform.

==Legacy==
===Re-enactment in 2005===

To commemorate the Great Salt March, the Mahatma Gandhi Foundation re-enacted the Salt March on its 75th anniversary, in its exact historical schedule and route followed by the Mahatma and his band of 78 marchers. The event was known as the &quot;International Walk for Justice and Freedom&quot;. What started as a personal pilgrimage for Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s great-grandson Tushar Gandhi turned into an international event with 900 registered participants from nine nations and on a daily basis the numbers swelled to a couple of thousands. There was extensive reportage in the international media.

The participants halted at Dandi on the night of 5 April, with the commemoration ending on 7 April. At the finale in Dandi, the prime minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, greeted the marchers and promised to build an appropriate monument at Dandi to commemorate the marchers and the historical event. The route from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi has now been christened as the Dandi Path and has been declared a historical heritage route.

India issued a series of commemorative stamps in 1980 and 2005, on the 50th and 75th anniversaries of the Dandi March.

===Memorial===
The National Salt Satyagraha Memorial, a memorial museum, dedicated to the event was opened in Dandi on 30 January 2019.

<text>Aspasia Manou (; 4 September 1896 – 7 August 1972) was a Greek aristocrat who became the wife of Alexander I, King of Greece. Due to the controversy over her marriage, she was styled Madame Manou instead of &quot;Queen Aspasia&quot;, until recognized as Princess Aspasia of Greece and Denmark after Alexander&#x27;s death and the restoration of King Constantine I, on 10 September 1922. Through her marriage, she and her descendants were the only ethnically Greek members of the Greek royal family, which originated in Denmark.

Daughter of Colonel Petros Manos, aide-de-camp to King Constantine I of Greece, and Maria Argyropoulos (Petros Manos and Maria Argyropoulos were both descendants of most prominent Greek Phanariote families of Constantinople and descendants of ruling Princes of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia), Aspasia grew up close to the royal family. After the divorce of her parents, she was sent to study in France and Switzerland. She returned to Greece in 1915 and met Prince Alexander, to whom she became secretly engaged due to the expected refusal of the royal family to recognize the relationship of Alexander I with a woman who did not belong to one of the European ruling dynasties.

Meanwhile, the domestic situation in Greece was complicated by World War I. King Constantine I abdicated in 1917 and Alexander was chosen as sovereign. Separated from his family and subjected to the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, the new ruler found comfort in Aspasia. Despite the opposition of his parents (exiled in Switzerland) and Venizelists (who wanted the king to marry a British princess), King Alexander I secretly married Aspasia on 17 November 1919. The public revelation of the wedding shortly after caused a huge scandal, and Aspasia temporarily left Greece. However, she was reunited with her husband after a few months of separation and was then allowed to return to Greece without receiving the title of Queen of the Hellenes. She became pregnant, but Alexander died on 25 October 1920, less than a year after their marriage.

At the same time, the situation in Greece was deteriorating again: the country was in the middle of a bloody conflict with the Ottoman Empire, Constantine I was restored (19 December 1920) only to be deposed again (27 September 1922), this time in favor of &quot;Diadochos&quot; (Crown Prince) George. Initially excluded from the royal family, Aspasia was gradually integrated after the birth of her daughter Alexandra on 25 March 1921 and was later recognized with the title of Princess Alexander of Greece and Denmark after a decree issued by her father-in-law. Nevertheless, her situation remained precarious due to the dislike of her sister-in-law Elisabeth of Romania and the political instability of the country. As the only members of the royal family to be allowed to stay in Greece after the proclamation of the Republic on 25 March 1924, Aspasia and her daughter chose to settle in Florence, with Queen Sophia. They remained there until 1927 then divided their time between the United Kingdom and Venice.

The restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 did not change Aspasia&#x27;s life. Sheltered by her in-laws, she made the Venetian villa &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; her main residence, until the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War in 1940. After a brief return to her country, where she worked for the Red Cross, the princess spent World War II in England. In 1944, her daughter married the exiled King Peter II of Yugoslavia, and Aspasia became a grandmother with the birth of Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia in 1945. Once peace was restored, Aspasia returned to live in Venice. Her last days were marked by economic hardship, illness and especially worry for her daughter, who made several suicide attempts. Aspasia died in 1972, but it was not until 1993 that her remains were transferred to the royal necropolis of Tatoi.

==Family==

Aspasia was born in Tatoi, Athens on 4 September 1896 as the eldest daughter of Petros Manos, a Colonel in the Hellenic Army, and his first wife, Maria Argyropoulos (1874-1930). Petros Manos and Maria Argyropoulos were second cousins, both being descendants of the most prominent Greek Phanariote families of Constantinople and the descendants of the ruling Princes of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia (commonly known as Danubian Principalities). Named after her maternal grandmother, Aspasia Anargyrou Petrakis, daughter of Anargyros Petrakis (1793-1876), the first modern Mayor of Athens, she had one younger full-sister, Roxane (born 28 February 1898), wife of Christos Zalokostas, former Olympian athlete, writer and later an industrialist. From her father&#x27;s second marriage to Sophie Tombazis-Mavrocordato (b. 1875) (daughter of Alexandros Tombazis and his wife, Princess Maria Mavrocordato), she had one half-sister, Rallou (1915–1988), a modern dancer, choreographer and a dance teacher, who was married to a prominent Greek architect Pavlos Mylonas.

==Early years==
After the divorce of her parents, Aspasia left Athens to complete her studies in France and Switzerland. Having returned to Greece in 1915, she came to live with her mother. Shortly after, she met her childhood friend, Prince Alexander of Greece, at a party given by the Palace Stable master, Theodoros 
Ypsilantis. Described by many of her contemporaries as a very beautiful woman, Aspasia immediately caught the attention of the prince who then had no other wish than to conquer her.

===Secret engagement===
Initially, Aspasia was very reluctant to accept the romantic advances of the prince. Renowned for his many female conquests, Alexander seemed to her untrustworthy, also because their social differences impeded any serious relationship. However, the perseverance of the Greek prince, who travelled to Spetses in the summer of 1915 for the sole purpose of seeing Aspasia, finally overcame her misgivings.

Deeply in love with each other, they became engaged but their marital project remained secret. Alexander&#x27;s parents, especially Queen Sophia (born a Prussian princess of the House of Hohenzollern), were very attached to social conventions, making it unthinkable that their children could marry persons not belonging to European royalty.

==World War I and its consequences==

===Accession to the throne of Alexander I===
During World War I, King Constantine I (who ascended to the throne in 1913 following the assassination of his father, King George I) kept Greece in a policy of neutrality towards the German Empire and the other powers of the Triple Alliance. Brother-in-law of Emperor William II, the Greek sovereign was accused by the Allies of being pro-German because he spent part of his military training in Prussia. This situation led to a rupture between the sovereign and his Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who was convinced of the need to support the countries of the Triple Entente to link the Greek minorities of the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans to the Hellenic Kingdom. In the end, King Constantine was deposed in 1917 and replaced by his second son Prince Alexander, considered more malleable than his elder brother &quot;Diadochos&quot; George by the Triple Entente.

On the day of his accession to the throne, 10 June 1917, Alexander I revealed to his father his relationship with Aspasia and asked him for permission to marry her. Very reluctant to approve what he considered a &quot;mésalliance&quot;, Constantine asked his son to wait until the end of the war to marry. In return, the deposed King promised to be his son&#x27;s witness at his wedding day. In these circumstances, Alexander agreed to postpone his projected marriage until the restoration of peace. Two days later, Constantine and his relatives arrived at the small port of Oropos and went into exile; it was the last time that Alexander was in contact with his family.

===A bond considered unequal===
Once his family went into exile, Alexander I found himself completely isolated by Eleftherios Venizelos and his supporters. The entire staff of the crown was gradually replaced by the enemies of Constantine I, and his son was forced to dismiss his friends when they were not simply arrested. Even the portraits of the dynasty were removed from the palaces, and sometimes the new ministers called him, in his presence, &quot;son of the traitor&quot;.

Prisoner in his own kingdom, the young monarch took very badly the separation from his family. He regularly wrote letters to his parents, but they were intercepted by the government and his family didn&#x27;t receive them. Under these conditions, the only comfort of Alexander was Aspasia and he decided to marry her despite the recommendations of his father and the opposition of the Prime Minister. Indeed, Eleftherios Venizelos, despite being previously a friend of Petros Manos (Aspasia&#x27;s father), feared that she used her family connections to mediate between Alexander I and his parents. Above all, the Prime Minister would have preferred that the monarch should marry Princess Mary of the United Kingdom to strengthen the ties between Greece and the Triple Entente.

However, the relationship of Alexander I and Aspasia did not only have enemies. The Greek royal dynasty was indeed of German origin and to find Byzantine ancestors to them they had to go back to the Middle Ages. In these circumstances, the union of the monarch and his fiancée would effectively Hellenize the dynasty, which would not displease all the Greeks. Finally, in the same foreign powers, particularly the British Embassy, the assumption of this marriage was seen favorably. Indeed, the influence of Aspasia on the sovereign was found to be positive, because she gave to him the strength to remain in the throne. The official visit of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, to Athens in March 1918 also confirmed the support of the United Kingdom to the marriage project. The son of Queen Victoria in fact requested to meet Aspasia and then told Alexander I that if he had been younger, he too would have sought to marry her.

==Scandalous marriage==

===Secret wedding===
Faced with the complete opposition of both the government and royal family, Alexander I and Aspasia decided to marry secretly. With the help of Aspasia&#x27;s brother-in-law, Christos Zalokostas, and after three attempts, the couple managed to be wedded by the Archimandrite Zacharistas in the evening of 17 November 1919. After the ceremony (which also included a civil wedding), the archimandrite swore to keep silent about it, but he quickly broke his promise and confessed the whole affair to the Metropolitan Meletius III of Athens. Through her marriage, she and her descendants would become the only ethnically Greek members of the Greek royal family, which originated in Denmark.

According to the Greek constitution, members of the royal family are not only obliged to obtain the permission of the sovereign to marry but also of the head of the Church of Greece. By marrying Aspasia without the consent of the Metropolitan, Alexander I had not complied with the law, causing a huge scandal in the country. Although the marriage of the young couple was retroactively recognized as legal (but non-dynastic) following Alexander&#x27;s death, Aspasia was never entitled to be known as &quot;Queen of the Hellenes&quot;; she was instead styled &quot;Madame Manos&quot;.

===Unequal marriage===
Despite his anger at the wedding, Eleftherios Venizelos permitted, initially, that Aspasia and her mother move to the Royal Palace with the condition that the marriage not be made public. However, the secret was soon discovered and Aspasia was forced to leave Greece to escape the scandal. Exiled, she settled first in Rome and then in Paris. Alexander I was allowed to join her in the French capital six months later. Officially, the monarch made a state visit to the Allies&#x27; heads of state gathered at the Peace Conference. In reality, the stay was something of a honeymoon for the couple.

Finally, Aspasia and her husband received permission from the government to get back together in Greece during summer 1920. In the Hellenic capital, &quot;Madame Manos&quot; was firstly in her sister&#x27;s house before moving to Tatoi Palace. It was during this period that she became pregnant, an event that caused great joy to the couple.

==Death of Alexander I==
On 2 October 1920, King Alexander I had an accident when he took a walk on the lands of the domain of Tatoi. A macaque who belonged to the manager of the vineyards of the palace attacked Fritz, the German shepherd dog of the sovereign, and he attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually, servants arrived and chased away the monkeys (which were later destroyed), and the King&#x27;s wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He didn&#x27;t consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.

Beginning on the night of the event, Alexander I developed a high fever: his wound had become infected and soon developed into septicaemia. With the rapid evolution of his illness, doctors planned to amputate his leg but no one wanted to take responsibility for such an act. Operated on seven times, he was cared for only by Aspasia during the four weeks of his illness. Under the effect of the blood poisoning, the young King suffered terribly and his cries of pain were heard in the entire Royal Palace. On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother. However, the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to re-enter the country. In St. Moritz, where she was exiled with the rest of the royal family, the Queen begged the Hellenic authorities to let her take care of her son but Venizelos remained adamant. Finally, Dowager Queen Olga, widow of George I, was allowed to travel alone to Athens to be with her grandson. Delayed by rough seas, however, she arrived twelve hours after the King&#x27;s death, on 25 October 1920. Informed by telegram that night, other members of the royal family learned of the death with sadness.

Two days after the death of the monarch, his funeral service was held in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. Once again, the royal family was refused permission to enter Greece; in consequence, apart from Aspasia, only Dowager Queen Olga was present at the funeral. The body of Alexander I was buried in the royal burial ground at Tatoi Palace.

==Birth of Alexandra and its consequences==
===Kingdom without a King===
Four months pregnant at the time of her husband&#x27;s death, Aspasia withdrew to the Diadochos Palace at Athens. In Greece, the unexpected death of Alexander I had much more serious consequences: it raised the question of succession and even the survival of the monarchy. Because the King had married without his father&#x27;s or the head of Orthodox Church&#x27;s permission, it was technically illegal, the marriage void, and the couple&#x27;s posthumous child illegitimate according to law. Maintaining the monarchy therefore involved finding another sovereign and, as the Venizelists still opposed Constantine I and &quot;Diadochos&quot; George, the government decided to offer the crown to another member of the royal family, the young Prince Paul. However, he refused to ascend the throne, which remained resolutely vacant.

With Aspasia&#x27;s pregnancy approaching its end, some plotted to put her child on the throne and rumours even assured that she was a supporter of this solution. The victory of the monarchists in the elections of 1 November 1920 changed everything. Dimitrios Rallis replaced Eleftherios Venizelos as Prime Minister and Constantine I was soon restored.

===Gradual integration into the royal family===
The restoration of Constantine I at first did not bring any change to Aspasia&#x27;s situation. Considered intriguing by part of the royal family, especially by her sister-in-law Princess Elisabeth of Romania who hated her, she was under the suspicion that she wanted to put her unborn child on the throne. The royal family feared the birth of a male child, which could further complicate the political situation at a time when Greece was already at war against the Ottoman Empire. However, not all members of the royal family shared this distrust: Princess Alice of Battenberg, aunt of the deceased Alexander I, chose to spend Christmas of 1920 in the company of Aspasia. For her part, Queen Sophia, who previously strongly opposed her son&#x27;s relationship with Aspasia, approached her daughter-in-law and awaited the birth of her first grandchild.

The birth of Alexandra on 25 March 1921 caused a great relief to the royal family: under the terms of the Salic law (which prevailed in Greece), the newborn could not claim the crown and she was unlikely to be used to undermine the dynasty. King Constantine I and Dowager Queen Olga therefore accepted easily that they become the godparents of the child. Still, neither the child nor her mother received more official recognition; only in July 1922, and at the behest of Queen Sophia, a law was passed which allowed the King to retroactively recognize marriages of members of the royal family, although on a non-dynastic basis. With this legal subterfuge, Alexandra obtained the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; and the title of Princess of Greece and Denmark. Aspasia&#x27;s status, however, was not changed with the law and she remained a simple commoner to the eyes of protocol.

Humiliated by this difference in treatment, Aspasia approached Prince Christopher of Greece (who also married a commoner), and begged him to intercede on her behalf. Moved by the arguments of his niece-in-law, the Prince talked to Queen Sophia, who eventually changed her opinion. Under pressure from his wife, King Constantine I issued a decree, gazetted 10 September 1922 under which Aspasia received the title &quot;Princess of Greece and Denmark&quot; and the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

==Fall of the monarchy and wandering life==

===From Athens to Florence===
Despite these positive developments, the situation of Aspasia and her daughter did not improve. Indeed, Greece experienced a serious military defeat against Turkey and a coup d&#x27;état soon forced Constantine I to abdicate in favor of &quot;Diadochos&quot; George, on 27 September 1922. Things went from bad to worse for the country, and a failed monarchist coup d&#x27;état forced the new King George II and his family into exile in December 1923. Four months later, on 25 March 1924, the Second Hellenic Republic was proclaimed and both Aspasia and Alexandra were then the only members of the dynasty allowed to stay in Greece.

Penniless, Aspasia, with her daughter, chose to follow her in-laws to the exile in early 1924. They found refuge with Queen Sophia, who moved to the &quot;Villa Bobolina&quot; in Fiesole near Florence shortly after the death of her husband in December 1923. The now Dowager Queen, who adored Alexandra, was delighted, even if her financial situation was also precarious.

===From London to Venice===
In 1927, Aspasia and her daughter moved to Ascot, Berkshire, in the United Kingdom. They were greeted by Sir James Horlick, 4th Baronet and his Horlick family, who harbored them in their ancestral seat Cowley Manor. With her personal savings and the financial support of Horlick, Aspasia bought a small property on the Island of Giudecca in Venice. Former home of Caroline and Frederic Eden, the villa and its 3.6 hectares of landscaped grounds are nicknamed the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot;, which delighted the Greek princesses.

==Possible second marriage==
Widow for many years, in 1933 Aspasia had a romantic relationship with the Sicilian Prince Starrabba di Giardinelli, who asked her to marry him. She was about to accept the proposal, when he suddenly fell ill and died of typhoid fever.

==Estrangement from the Greek royal family==
===Restoration of the monarchy and outbreak of World War II===
In 1935, the Second Hellenic Republic was abolished and George II was restored to the throne after a referendum organized by General Georgios Kondylis. While several members of the royal family decided to return to Greece, Aspasia chose to remain in Italy, but claimed, in the name of her daughter, her rightful share of the inheritance of Alexander I. Unlike Princess Alexandra, Aspasia was subsequently not invited to the ceremonies which marked the return of the remains of King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and Dowager Queen Olga to the Kingdom (1936), or the wedding of her brother-in-law, the &quot;Diadochos&quot; Paul, with Princess Frederica of Hanover (1938). Even worse, Aspasia did not have a plot in the royal cemetery of Tatoi, because the grave of her husband was placed next to that of his parents in order to keep him away from his wife even in death.

The outbreak of the Greco-Italian War on 28 October 1940 forced Aspasia and Alexandra to suddenly leave fascist Italy. They settled with the rest of the royal family in Athens. Eager to serve her country in this difficult moment, Aspasia helped with the Red Cross. However, after several months of victorious battles against the Italian forces, Greece was invaded by the army of Nazi Germany and the majority of the members of the royal family left the country on 22 April 1941. After a brief stay in Crete, where they survived a German bombing raid, Aspasia and her family departed for Egypt and South Africa.

===Settling in England and Alexandra&#x27;s marriage===
While several members of the royal family were forced to spend World War II in South Africa, Aspasia obtained the permission of King George II of Greece and the British government to move to the United Kingdom with her daughter. Arrived at Liverpool in the fall of 1941, they settled in Mayfair, London. In the English capital, the Greek princesses resumed their activities with the Red Cross. Better accepted than in their own country, they were regularly received by their cousin Marina, Duchess of Kent (born Princess of Greece and Denmark) and, while he was on leave from the Royal Navy, met the future Duke of Edinburgh (born Prince Philip of Greece), who for some time was looked on as a suitable husband for Alexandra.

However, Alexandra soon met and was attracted to another royal figure. In 1942, the Greek princess met King Peter II of Yugoslavia at an officers gala at Grosvenor House. The 19-year-old sovereign had lived in exile in London since the invasion of his country by the Axis powers in April 1941. They quickly fell in love with each other and eventually were married on 20 March 1944, despite the opposition of the Queen Mother Maria of Yugoslavia (born Princess Maria of Romania). The ceremony was very modest, because of financial difficulties related to the war, but Aspasia, who always wanted to see her daughter marry well, was delighted.

Shortly after the end of the war, on 17 July 1945, Queen Alexandra gave birth to her only child, Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia, in Suite 212 of Claridge&#x27;s Hotel in Brook Street, London, which according to some reports was transformed for the occasion into Yugoslav territory by the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. However, the arrival of the heir to the throne was quickly followed by the deposition of the Karađorđević dynasty and the proclamation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by Marshal Tito on 29 November 1945. This was the beginning of a long period of difficulties, marked by financial instability, the pursuit of vain political projects and the deterioration of relations between Alexandra and Peter II.

==Later life==
===Return to Venice and financial difficulties===
After the end of World War II, Aspasia decided not to go back to Greece and she returned to Venice, to live once more on the Island of Giudecca. Back in the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot;, she found her house partially destroyed by the conflict and began to rebuild. Still without sufficient financial resources and concerned about the situation of her daughter (who granted her at one point the guardianship of her grandson Crown Prince Alexander,), Aspasia led a quiet life, punctuated by a few public appearances during cultural events. Over the years, her financial situation deteriorated even further, and during the winter of 1959–1960, the Princess was no longer able to pay the heating bills. She temporarily left the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; and stayed in the hotels &quot;Europa&quot; and &quot;Britannia&quot; in Venice. Shortly after, she was forced to sell some furniture and other valuables to pay off her debts.

===Alexandra&#x27;s depression and health problems===
Demoralised by exile and financial difficulties, the former King Peter II of Yugoslavia gradually became an alcoholic and relieved his boredom by multiplying his affairs with other women. Worn down by the behavior of her husband, with whom she was still in love, Alexandra developed behaviours increasingly dangerous to her health. Probably prone to anorexia, in 1950 the former queen undertook a first suicide attempt, while staying with her mother. After several years of wandering between Italy, the United States and France, Alexandra finally moved permanently to the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; after the death of Peter II in 1970.

===Aspasia&#x27;s health and death===
Heartbroken by the fate of her daughter, Aspasia saw her own health gradually deteriorate over the years. Seriously ill, she could not attend the wedding of her grandson with Princess Maria da Gloria of Orléans-Braganza on 1 July 1972. One month later, on 7 August 1972, Princess Aspasia died in the &quot;Ospedale al Mare&quot; in Venice. At the time, Greece was ruled by the Regime of the Colonels and so Alexandra chose to bury her mother in the Orthodox section of the cemetery of San Michele island near Venice. Only after the death of Alexandra, in January 1993, were the remains of Aspasia and her daughter transferred to the Royal Cemetery Plot in the park of Tatoi near Dekeleia, at the request of Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia.

<text>GKS Bełchatów is a Polish professional football club based in Bełchatów. The club currently competes in group I of the III liga.

== History ==

GKS Bełchatów entered Poland&#x27;s Klasa A in 1977 under the name of Węgiel Brunatny Bełchatów, and gained promotion to the III liga in the 1981–82 season. It took the club another seven years to rise to the II liga (1986/1987 season), before winning a place in the top-tier I liga in 1992. After another spell in II liga, the club again won promotion to the I liga at the end of the 2004–05 season. The club finished the 2005–06 season in 10th place, with 37 points. The following season they challenged for the league title. After spending much of the latter part of the 2006–07 season in first place, they were ultimately overtaken by Zagłębie Lubin and had to settle for second place.

On 11 March 2022, the club, then playing in the II liga, withdrew from the league and did not start playing in the spring round. As a consequence, they were moved to the last place in the 2021–22 season standings and their remaining matches being declared 0–3 forfeits for their opponents. They declared liquidation on 20 April 2022. On 31 May 2022, the Łódź Football Association admitted its academy (Akademia GKS Bełchatów) as its continuator to the Łódź group of the fifth division for the 2022–23 season.

<text>Pogoń Szczecin Spółka Akcyjna, commonly referred to as Pogoń Szczecin (), is a Polish professional football club based in Szczecin, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, which plays in the Ekstraklasa, the top tier of the national football league system.
== History ==
The club was founded by Poles from Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine), who had been transferred west after the Soviet annexation of Poland&#x27;s eastern territories in 1945. The founders of Pogoń Szczecin had previously been supporters of Pogoń Lwów and the colors of their new club reflect their old club. Polonia Bytom and Odra Opole were likewise founded or revived by the former inhabitants of Lwów.

The most popular sports organization in Szczecin was founded on 21 April 1948 as &quot;Klub Sportowy Sztorm&quot;. Its first departments were football and boxing, and the football team began playing in the local &quot;C-Klasa&quot;. In March 1949, several sports clubs in Szczecin (&quot;KS Sztorm, KS Cukrownik, KS Drukarz, Pocztowy KS&quot;) were merged into a large organization called &quot;Klub Sportowy Zwiazkowiec&quot;. The team of Zwiazkowiec joined local &quot;A-Class league&quot;, replacing &quot;Pocztowy KS&quot;. In November 1950, Zwiazkowiec was dissolved, and a new organization, &quot;Klub Sportowy Kolejarz Szczecin&quot; was formed. Its football team, supported by the Port of Szczecin, in 1953 was promoted to the newly created &quot;Interregional League&quot; (&quot;Liga Międzywojewódzka&quot;), which covered the provinces of Szczecin, Zielona Góra and Poznań.

In autumn 1955, Kolejarz was renamed into Pogoń Szczecin. The name and the hues of the club are a continuation of Pogoń Lwów. In 1957, Pogoń was runner up of the Interregional League, qualifying to the second division playoffs. After beating Flota Gdynia, Kujawiak Włocławek and Warta Gorzów, Pogoń for the first time won promotion to the second level of Polish football system. In 1958, Pogoń was the winner of Group North of the Second Division (37 points, goals 54–22, not a single game lost), winning promotion to the Ekstraklasa.

In its top level debut, Pogoń lost at home to Gwardia Warszawa 0–1. In 1960, Pogoń was relegated from the Ekstraklasa, to return there in 1962.

For most of the 1960s and 1970s, Pogoń remained in the top Polish league, but remained an average team, without any successes. This changed in the early 1980s: in 1981, Pogoń advanced to the final of the Polish Cup, to lose 0–1 to Legia Warsaw. In 1982, Pogoń again made it to the Polish Cup final, to lose 0–1 to Lech Poznań.

In 1984 Pogoń, managed by Eugeniusz Ksol, for the first time in history was among top three teams in the Ekstraklasa, which meant that the team qualified for the UEFA Cup. In its European debut, Pogoń faced 1. FC Köln, with such stars as Harald Schumacher, Pierre Littbarski and Klaus Allofs. In the first leg (September 19, 1984 in Cologne), Pogoń lost 1–2. In the second leg (October 3), Polish team lost 0–1, after its players failed to score on two penalty kicks.

In 1987, Pogoń was Polish runner-up. Managed by Leszek Jezierski, the team played offensively, scoring plenty of goals. With such players as Mariusz Kuras, Marek Ostrowski and Marek Leśniak, Pogoń was only behind Górnik Zabrze. In the first round of UEFA Cup, Pogon faced Hellas Verona, with Thomas Berthold and Preben Elkjær. In the first leg (September 16, 1987), Pogoń tied at home 1–1. Two weeks later, Polish team lost in Italy 1–3.

Pogoń in 2002 was on the brink of bankruptcy. As a result, fans created a new team on the basis of the reserves in the fourth division. However owner of Piotrcovia Piotrków Trybunalski Antoni Ptak decided to move the team and renamed the club MKS Pogoń Szczecin. The initial distrust was lost when the team performed well and used local players, however halfway through the 2005–06 season the team started underperforming and Ptak decided to replace almost the entire squad with only Brazilian nationals, making it the &quot;most Brazilian team outside Brazil&quot;. Antoni Ptak also built a small training facility in Gutów Mały, meaning the home games were played almost away from Szczecin. The experiment failed and in 2007 Antoni Ptak moved away from football, leaving the club to be rebuilt on the basis of the 4th division counterpart set up originally by the fans, which acted as the reserve team in the meantime.

The club was promoted to the Zachodnia (Western) group of the new II Liga (formerly the Third League) for the 2007–08 season. The club earned promotion to the Polish First League after finishing 2nd in Western Group of Polish Second League in 2008–09 season. Despite playing on the second tier, Pogoń performed well in the 2009–10 Polish Cup, defeating top division teams Polonia Warsaw, Piast Gliwice and Ruch Chorzów to reach the final, to lose 0–1 to Jagiellonia Białystok. Finally Pogoń returned to the top division after finishing the First League as runner-up in the 2011–12 season.

Since then, Pogoń has promoted a number of players to the Poland national team and transferred several players to stronger leagues, including Sebastian Walukiewicz to Serie A side Cagliari Calcio and Kacper Kozłowski to Premier League side Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. While still a Pogoń player, Kozłowski, aged 17 years and 246 days, became the youngest-ever player to play at the European Championship, when he capped for Poland against Spain in June 2021. From 2020, Pogoń re-established itself as one of the top teams in the country, finishing third in the league twice in a row (2020–21, 2021–22), and then fourth twice in a row (2022–23, 2023–24).

==Crest and colours==

The club&#x27;s colours are navy blue and maroon. Incorporated into the club&#x27;s crest, they are derived from Pogoń Lwów, from which Pogoń Szczecin also took its name. The crowned griffin in the crest comes from the coat of arms of the city of Szczecin. Additionally, the crest contains the name &quot;Pogoń&quot; and the year of the club&#x27;s foundation, i.e. 1948.

The club mascot Gryfus is a red crowned griffin, also derived from the coat of arms of Szczecin.

<doc id="677655" wikidata="Q1257951" url="?curid=677655" title="Third rail (model rail)">
<text>The use of a [[third rail]] in rail transport modelling is a technique that was once applied, in order to facilitate easier wiring.

== Early train sets ==
Pre-war train sets from makers such as Hornby were almost entirely O gauge, either clockwork or electric, with the electric sets using a three rail system. Both the track and rolling stock were made from pressed, lithographed tinplate, with a few pieces of die-cast zinc or turned brass. The third rail was insulated from the tinplate sleepers by insulating fibre washers.

Post-war, there was a shift from O gauge to half-size scales of HO and OO. Improved technology at this time, particularly for moulded plastic components, made two-rail electrification practical. Many of the new generation of scenic railway modellers scratch-built their new locomotives for two-rail, although this was far from universally accepted. Most of the commercial train set makers continued with three-rail systems for some time.

== Difficulties of two-rail ==
Using a two-rail electrification system for a model railway has a number of difficulties, for both track and rolling stock.

=== Track ===
Track obviously requires the two rails to be insulated from each other, and from the trackbed, if that is made of metal. If the track pieces are reversible, both rails must be insulated. Reliable running also requires accurate control of the track&#x27;s gauge, all of which needed accurately injection-moulded plastic fittings, rather than the flexible fibre.

Pointwork was a further problem, as the frog and moving blades are connected to opposite rails, according to which direction in which the points are set. This requires either an insulated two-part frog, with the risk of poor contact to locomotives crossing it; or else an all-metal &#x27;live&#x27; frog which must be insulated from the rails beyond the pointwork, and which usually requires an additional switch to give a reliable connection. In comparison, the three-rail system is simply isolated from the running lines.

Some layouts, such as a balloon loop, also create problems for two-rail, as they connect the opposing rails together around the loop and could require isolation.

=== Rolling stock ===
Carriages and wagons can use moulded plastic wheelsets, which are compatible with both three- and two-rail systems. Hornby Dublo introduced these in 1959, during their transition to two rail, when most users were still using three-rail layouts.

=== Locomotives ===
A two-rail locomotive must both avoid shorting the two running rails, and must also collect current from both sides independently. For a three-rail locomotive the wheels and axles are typically metal and the metal chassis may be used as a ground connection. This has the advantage that all wheels, including bogies, act as pickups. This gives a long collection length, reducing the problem of crossing supply gaps.

For two-rail, current collection is typically done by phosphor bronze spring strip collectors on the back of the wheel rims. If the wheels are insulated by using plastic wheels in metal rims, only the rim is available to a collector. Only those wheels, often two, with collector springs can collect current from the track. This can give problems for crossing gaps in pointwork. An alternative system is &#x27;split frame&#x27; construction, which had some popularity for the early narrow gauges, such as N gauge and the modelling of narrow gauge prototypes. This uses conductive metal wheels and axles, where the axles are split in half as two sides, insulated from each other. The locomotive frames are split likewise. Rather than separate pickup springs, the axle bearings are used as the collectors. This technique is somewhat complicated for making the axles, but adapts more easily to narrower gauges. It can also easily collect current from all of the driving wheels, or even pony truck wheels too.

==Two-rail versus three-rail system==

Early toy trains used two metal rail tracks like most real trains. However, manufacturers quickly found that using a center rail for electric power and the two outer rails for common or ground made electrical contact much more reliable and less prone to short circuits. Three rail contact also negates the need for insulated wheels, an important consideration before plastics became widely available. Most scales and gauges that predate H0 scale used three rails for electric operation.

=== Direction ===
Three-rail DC locomotives will move in the same direction, &#x27;forwards&#x27;, whenever the third rail has the same polarity, no matter which way round they are placed on the track. Two identical locomotives can move in different directions on the track, depending on which orientation they are placed on it.

In contrast, two-rail locos will move in the same direction relative to the track. If the loco is reversed, it will still move in the same (track-relative) direction. By convention, all locos are wired and geared to move consistently, so that double-heading trains is possible.

The Marklin stud contact system uses AC motors. These are independent of the supply polarity and instead use an internal switch, controlled by a higher-voltage pulse to reverse direction.

==Three-rail system==

A key advantage for three-rail track is balloon loops, where a train enters a loop through a turnout and then exits through the same turnout in order to change the train&#x27;s direction. With two-rail track, when the track reverses on itself, this causes a short circuit. With three-rail track, because the center rail remains constant and the outer rails are electrically identical, this causes no problems.

The third rail has also been used to automate and animate layouts. An accessory, such as a railway signal, can be wired to a section of track that has had one of its outer rails insulated (not grounded), either at the factory or by a hobbyist. A passing train then grounds the insulated rail, completing the circuit and causing the accessory to operate.

Insulated rails (or rail sections) can also be used to control turnouts, causing the turnout to switch to the position needed by an oncoming train.

Because of this feature, railroad cars intended for three-rail operation will not work on two-rail track unless their wheels are first insulated from each other. Cars intended for two-rail track will operate on three-rail track, but they will not activate controls wired to an insulated rail. Conversion of three-rail cars for two-rail operation, or vice versa, is thus a common practice among hobbyists. It requires either replacing the bogies (wheel assemblies) on the car, or replacing metal axles with axles made of a non-conductive material.

The main disadvantage of three-rail track is its lack of realism. While some real-world trains do use a third rail, the prototypes for the majority of model railroad operations do not. Lionel tried to improve this situation in the late 1950s with its &quot;Super O&quot; track, which blackened the middle rail and made it thinner to reduce its visibility. Other O scale manufacturers use similar techniques today.

== Stud contact ==

Märklin uses a &quot;phantom&quot; third rail, where the middle rail is concealed in the track ballast or ties, with only studs protruding, giving the advantages of three-rail operation without seriously detracting from its realism. This is stud contact electrification for model railways and is often used on garden railway systems. Garden railways often have a mixture of electrical and real steam locomotives, and while it is possible, insulating model steam locomotives to run on two rail electrification systems is problematic. In practice the stud system outdoors has been found to be more resistant to continuity problems caused by the outdoor environment.

== Trix twin ==
Although most three-rail systems ties the two outer rails together electrically, some manufacturers wire all three rails independently. GarGraves is a North American manufacturer of O gauge three-rail track with all of its rails insulated. Trix Express is a European manufacturer of three-rail track who insulates all three rails.

On a simple, non-computerised layout only one train can run independently on either a two or three-rail system (two trains if combined with overhead lines). On the insulated three-rail type, two trains can run independently (three trains if combined with overhead lines).

== Outside third rail ==
In the early days of railway modeling, some O scale modelers (the dominant scale at the time), made use of an outside third rail and a shoe pickup system for power. This system had the benefit of being more realistic by removing the central third rail common to O scale track, while retaining an effective power source. As technology progressed, later developments in locomotive and track design would allow for two rail operation, and ultimately rendered the practice obsolete.

<text>Cracovia () is a Polish professional football club based in Kraków. The club is five-time Polish champion, besides being the inaugural Polish champion, winner of the Polish Cup and the Polish Super Cup in 2020. Founded in 1906, Cracovia is the oldest Polish club still in existence. They play in the Ekstraklasa, the top tier of the national football league system.

== History ==

=== Beginning ===
The early years of football in the city of Kraków are associated with professor Henryk Jordan. He was a Polish physician who had spent some time in Britain and after coming back to his native city introduced football to its youth. Jordan was a huge supporter of all sports and gymnastics. On 12 March 1889, he founded The Park of Games and Plays in Kraków, which was commonly called Jordan&#x27;s Park. Places like this later spread all across Austrian Galicia, and apart from gymnastics, the youth there became acquainted with football.

However, it was not Kraków where the first football game with Polish participation took place. This happened in Lwów on 14 July 1894, with a six-minute match between the teams of Lwów and Kraków. The home team proved better, winning 1–0 through a goal by Włodzimierz Chomicki.
Within the next few years, football slowly emerged as a rising sport. It was especially popular among high school students and in the fall of 1903, a group of them created the team of Sława Lwów (the name was later changed to Czarni Lwów), the first Polish football club. In 1904, a group of Lwów&#x27;s students, together with professor Eugeniusz Piasecki, came to Kraków to play an exhibition match. The match ended in Lwów&#x27;s 0–4 defeat, and its far-reaching implications among Kraków&#x27;s youth were enormous.

13 June 1906 is regarded as a crucial date in the history of football in Kraków. On that day, two matches of high school teams took place. These matches had been announced in Kraków&#x27;s newspapers. Czarni Lwów beat the team of &quot;White-reds&quot; (&quot;Biało-czerwoni&quot;) and the IV Gymnasium beat Akademicy. The matches were warmly welcomed by Kraków&#x27;s fans, who were surprised to see for the first time real football gear, brought by players from Lwów. 13 June is also regarded as the day of Cracovia&#x27;s creation.

In the fall of 1906, another tournament took place, in which as many as 16 teams participated. Immediately prior to the matches, Jerzy Lustgarten from the team of Akademicy came up with the new name – Cracovia, which is a Latin name for Kraków. This was accepted and henceforth the new team&#x27;s full name was &quot;Akademicki Klub Footballowy, Cracovia&quot;.

On 21 October 1906, the teams of Cracovia and &quot;Biało-czerwoni&quot; played each other, drawing 1–1. The next year, facing difficulties, those two teams decided to join forces, thus creating a stronger club, which took over the name Cracovia and white-red jerseys. The combined team went to Lwów on 1 July 1907, where they lost a game against Czarni, 1–4.

In 1908, an Englishman named William Calder came to Kraków. He was a teacher of English and a huge fan of football. It was in his apartment that the first club IDs and pinup badges were handed out. In May of that year, Cracovia for the first time ever faced a team from abroad. This was an ethnic German side, Troppauer Sportverein, from the Czech city of Opava.

In 1910, Cracovia&#x27;s statutes were officially recognised by the Austrian government in Lwów and in the same year the club joined the Austrian Football Association, where it gained the proud title of the 1st class team. Kraków&#x27;s side was very active internationally, often playing Czech, German and Austrian teams. However, it did not forget its roots, and it was due to Cracovia&#x27;s initiative that the Polish Football Association (PZPN) was formed.

On 31 March 1912, after two years&#x27; efforts, Cracovia finally received its own pitch. The same year brought the debut of Józef Kałuża, one of Cracovia&#x27;s most popular players, who at first had to use the nickname &quot;Kowalski&quot;. The next year, Cracovia won the Championship of Austrian Galicia. However, in 1914, the matches were cancelled because of the outbreak of World War I.

=== Interwar period ===
In spite of the war, Cracovia&#x27;s football team did not cease its activities, playing several games with such renowned teams as Admira Wacker Wien, Vasas and Wiener Sport-Club. In those years, new players emerged, such as defender Ludwik Gintel, midfielder Stanislaw Cikowski and forward Leon Sperling. All these footballers would become members of the Poland national team in the next few years, after Poland regained independence. Also, Cracovia&#x27;s great play in games against some elite teams of Hungarian football (such as FTC Budapest and MTK Budapest) helped convince the Hungarians to invite Poland for an international friendly in 1921 (it should be mentioned that in this first historical match of Poland, there were seven Cracovia players in the starting lineup).

In 1920, the budding PZPN was unable to carry out the championships of the whole country. The situation was insecure, Polish borders were not determined and Poland was waging several wars with its neighbours. Under the circumstances, the Kraków department of the PZPN organized its own matches; the tournament was won by Cracovia, ahead of Wisła Kraków. The next year, in the 1921 matches, Cracovia became the first, historic champion of Poland.

During the following years, the team often traveled across Europe, playing in Scandinavia, France and Spain. The most memorable is the trip to Spain, which occurred in the fall of 1923. Cracovia showed itself as a good side, drawing 1–1 with Barcelona, winning 3–2 against Sevilla and losing to the renowned teams of Real Madrid and Valencia
In 1928, Cracovia joined the Polish Football League, which had been created a year earlier. Two years later, Kraków&#x27;s side for the second time in its history became the Champion of Poland. This was repeated in 1932. At the end of the season, Cracovia placed ahead of such famous teams as Pogoń Lwów, Warta Poznań, Wisła Kraków and ŁKS Łódź. In 1934, the team was the vicechampion. However, next year, Cracovia was demoted from Ekstraklasa.

Cracovia&#x27;s absence from the League lasted only one season. After beating Śmigły Wilno, AKS Chorzów and Brygada Częstochowa, the team returned. And the return was so successful that in their first season back (1937) Cracovia won the League, becoming the Champion for the fourth time.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, the German occupiers of Poland banned the Poles from officially playing any sports games. However, Cracovia, just like other teams from Kraków, participated in secret championships of the city, which were organised every year from 1940 to 1944. &quot;Pasy&quot; won only once – in 1943.

One of Cracovia&#x27;s most famous players, Jozef Kałuża, who in the 1930s was the coach of the Poland national team, refused to take the post of manager of Nazi German-sponsored football events. Kałuża did not survive the war, as he died in 1944. Pre-war player of Cracovia Adam Kogut was among Poles murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. On 28 January 1945, soon after liberation, the first official game between Wisła and Cracovia took place. Numerous spectators started by singing the Polish National Anthem. Later, on the snowy pitch, Wisła turned out to be the better side, winning 2–0.

=== Post-war period ===

In the years 1946 and 1947, Cracovia played numerous friendly internationals, as well as qualifiers for the Polish Championship. The team finished second in their group, thus not getting promoted to central playoffs.

However, in the Polish League&#x27;s first postwar season (1948), Cracovia, together with Wisła Kraków, were the leading teams. After a fierce competition, both sides were level at first place. Under the circumstances, a third, decisive game was necessary. There, Cracovia proved its quality, winning 3–1, with the game taking place in December 1948. This was their fifth, and most recent, championship.

The following years were marked by Cracovia&#x27;s slow decline. The last success – vice-championship of Poland (1949) – was then followed by the team&#x27;s worsening position, which culminated in 1954, when Cracovia was demoted to the second division. An ill-considered policy of Cracovia&#x27;s decision-makers should be blamed for the failures. The club was tied to Kraków&#x27;s Transit Authority, which turned out to be a very bad solution, as it did not bring sufficient funds to make running the club feasible.

Between 1947 and 1954, ten of Cracovia&#x27;s players were members of the Poland national team. These were: Władysław Gędłek, Tadeusz Parpan, Henryk Bobula, Tadeusz Glimas, Edward Jabłoński and Czesław Rataj.

=== Communist era ===
These years were full of ups and downs for Cracovia. Most of the time the team played in the Second Division, winning promotion on several occasions, only to be demoted after a year or two (promotions took place in 1961, 1966 and 1969). In 1959, the junior team won the Championships of Poland. Some of Cracovia&#x27;s players got the chance to represent Poland (Andrzej Rewilak, Krzysztof Hausner), but glory years were over. Sometimes, the side achieved some good scores in friendly games (1–1 against Partizan in 1966 or 3–2 against Dinamo Minsk in 1963). In 1963, a sad incident occurred. Cracovia&#x27;s wooden stands burned down, so the team had to play its home games on either Wawel Kraków&#x27;s or Wisła&#x27;s turf.

The years described were by far the worst period in the history of Cracovia&#x27;s football department. In 1969, the team again was promoted to the First League, and demoted after one year. Then, demotions came one after the other – to the Second, Third and finally – to the Fourth, regional league. It was a shock, as never before had Cracovia been so low.

The team quickly scrambled itself out of the regional league, however, anchoring in the Third Division. This level was not satisfying for the five-time champions of Poland, so Cracovia tried hard to get higher, but it was not easy. In 1975, 20,000 fans watched a lost game against Lublinianka. In 1976, they were second (after Hutnik Kraków). In 1977, at home, Cracovia had to beat Resovia to win promotion. The match ended in a tie and thus Resovia got promoted.

Finally, Kraków&#x27;s team placed first in 1978 and returned to the Second Division. Then, on 30 May 1982, all Cracovia&#x27;s fans were overcome with joy. After 13 long years, their side returned to the First Division. However, the happiness did not last long – only two years. After this interval, Cracovia was demoted firstly to the Second, then to the Third Division. While in the First Division, Kraków&#x27;s side won some important games (3–1 with Legia Warsaw and 1–0 with the champion – Lech Poznań), but this was not enough.

The second half of the 1980s was marked by a total decline. Cracovia was in the Third Division; its team never qualified higher. Because there were no sponsors, all the good players were en masse leaving the organisation to different, richer clubs. Celebrations of Cracovia&#x27;s 80th anniversary (1986) were sad and prospects for the future were dim.

=== Changing times ===
The years 1986–1990 were stagnant, with Cracovia having been unable to get itself out of the 3rd Division, group VIII. The team was most of the time in the upper part of the table, but never won the league. In 1990 and 1991 Cracovia&#x27;s junior team twice became the Champion of Poland and with a group of young, talented players (such as Tomasz Rząsa and Lukasz Kubik) supporters hoped for better times.

In June 1991, after beating Radomiak Radom in the playoffs, Cracovia finally won promotion, only to be demoted back to the 3rd Division after one year. Another promotion took place in the summer of 1995. Then, Cracovia for the first time in years faced its main rival, Wisła Kraków, beating it 1–0 in an away game (September 1995), on a goal by Krzysztof Duda. This time, Cracovia survived three seasons in the 2nd Division, but in June 1998 it was again relegated back to the 3rd League.

In mid-2002, due to the efforts of numerous, faithful supporters, Cracovia attracted a rich sponsor, Comarch, owned by professor Janusz Filipiak. This meant that finally there was money for development. Several players were purchased, such as Piotr Giza, Arkadiusz Baran, Łukasz Skrzyński and Paweł Nowak. Under new head coach Wojciech Stawowy, promotion came fast – in the fall of 2003, Cracovia returned to the Second Division.

=== Today ===

After promotion, Cracovia spent only one year in the Second Division. The team, with Kazimierz Węgrzyn, Piotr Giza and Marcin Bojarski, finished the 2003–04 season in third position, but after routing Górnik Polkowice in the playoffs, Cracovia returned to the top flight.

The newly promoted side had a successful 2004–05 season, being in contention for a UEFA Cup place until finally finishing in fifth place. A ninth-place finish followed in 2005–06. The 2006–07 season was their best since the early 1950s. Cracovia, under coach Stefan Majewski, finished fourth overall, behind Zagłębie Lubin, GKS Bełchatów and Legia Warsaw.

Cracovia finished the 2007–08 Ekstraklasa season in seventh place, but due to a match-fixing scandal resulting in relegation of such teams as Zagłębie Lubin and Korona Kielce, the team unexpectedly was offered a spot in the Intertoto Cup. However, Cracovia were quickly defeated in the first round by Belarusian side Shakhtyor Soligorsk, 5–1 on aggregate.
At the end of 2008–09 Ekstraklasa season, Cracovia was 15th (out of 16 clubs) in the league table, which normally would result in its relegation to I liga. However, ŁKS Łódź, who finished 7th, were not granted the licence to play in the Ekstraklasa for the following season; Cracovia eventually took the 14th place in the table and remained in the Ekstraklasa. They also narrowly avoided relegation after the 2010–11 season, but finished last in the 2011–12 season and was relegated to the 2012–13 I liga. They earned promotion back to the Ekstraklasa in 2013 after defeating Miedź Legnica 3–1 on 8 June 2013.

Since December 2009, Cracovia cooperates with 1860 Munich. On 24 July 2020, Cracovia lifted the Polish Cup for the first time, their first national honour in 73 years. On 9 October 2020, Cracovia was victorious in the 2020 Polish Super Cup.

=== Rivalries ===
Cracovia&#x27;s biggest rival is Wisła Kraków. When they play, it is known as the &quot;Holy War&quot;, it is the oldest and in the past, frequently also the most violent derby in Poland, with notable riots and stabbings having taken place during matchdays, as well as continually around the housing estates of the city.

Apart from derby rivals Wisła, Cracovia also has a fierce rivalry with the third club in the city, Hutnik Nowa Huta. Other rivals include Legia Warsaw, Śląsk Wrocław, Ruch Chorzów, Zagłębie Sosnowiec, Pogoń Szczecin, Motor Lublin and Lechia Gdańsk.

Across the years, Cracovia attracted several renowned names, who attended the games and publicly declared their support. Unquestionably, the most famous fan of the team was Karol Józef Wojtyła, who, even after having been named Pope John Paul II, would often ask visitors from Poland about Cracovia. As a continuing tribute, an image of the late pope hangs on a wall inside the Cracovia change room beneath a crucifix. Also, among other personalities who support the club, there are/were such persons, as Józef Piłsudski, Gustaw Holoubek, Jerzy Pilch, Kazimierz Wyka, Grzegorz Miecugow, Leszek Mazan, Jerzy Harasymowicz, Maciej Maleńczuk, Stefan Friedmann and Nigel Kennedy.

<text>Zagłębie Lubin S.A. () is a Polish professional football club based in Lubin. Founded in 1945 as &quot;OMTUR Lubin&quot;, the club competes in the Ekstraklasa.

==History==

The football team was founded in 1945 as OMTUR Lubin by local members of the &quot;Youth Organization of the Association of Workers’ Universities&quot; (&quot;Organizacja Młodzieży Towarzystwa Uniwersytetów Robotniczych, OMTUR&quot;). The team played matches on a pitch at Kościuszko Street. The games of OMTUR Lubin were very popular, attracting crowds of people. Among the opponents, was the team of the local Red Army garrison, which faced the Poles in the autumn of 1945.

In March 1946, Klub Sportowy Zawisza, based on OMTUR Lubin, was formed (the name comes after a medieval knight, Zawisza Czarny). Among its players was Emil Czyżowski of Pogoń Lwów, Tadeusz Rela of Tarnovia Tarnów, and Stanisław Leśniewski, who had briefly played for Dynamo Kyiv. In 1946, Zawisza played in the Group IV, winning promotion to the newly formed A-Klasa. On May 5, 1946 Zawisza Lubin played its first ever league game against MKS Zgorzelec. In 1947, Zawisza won the &quot;Cup of Lower Silesia&quot;, and in the same year, the team from Lubin faced the team of the Northern Group of Forces, headquartered in nearby Legnica. The game, which Poles won 1–0, was attended by Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky.

In 1949, Zawisza Lubin changed name into Gwardia, and in 1951, to Spojnia. In 1953, the team returned to its original name, Zawisza.

In 1957, rich deposits of copper were discovered in the area of Lubin. With the construction of the Lubin mine, the team gained a rich sponsor (see also KGHM Polska Miedz). In 1961, its name was changed to Górnik (&quot;Miner&quot;). In 1963, Górnik won promotion from the C-Klasa to the B-Klasa. Finally, in 1966, its name was changed to MKS Zagłębie Lubin, with MKS standing for Międzyzakładowy Klub Sportowy (&quot;Inter-Enterprise Sports Club&quot;). In 1968, Zagłębie won promotion to the third division. In the 1970s Zagłębie had nine departments: football, volleyball, basketball, boxing, handball, track and field, weight lifting, table tennis and contract bridge. In 1974, became the team&#x27;s new manager. Zagłębie was a sensation in the 1975–76 Polish Cup, beating the reigning Polish champions Ruch Chorzów, however, they eventually lost to Górnik Zabrze.

In 1975, Zagłębie won a promotion to the second division, only to be relegated after one year. In 1978, it again was promoted and relegated after one year. The team was a sensation in the 1978–79 Polish Cup, beating GKS Katowice, Legia Warsaw and Górnik Zabrze, and reaching the semi-final, where they lost 0–3 to Wisła Kraków.

In 1982, under manager Stanisław Świerk, Zagłębie again won promotion to the second division. In 1985, it was finally promoted to the Ekstraklasa. With a new manager, Eugeniusz Rozanski, and a new stadium, Zagłębie was at that time one of the most powerful sports organization in Poland. On 27 July 1985, Zagłębie played its first Ekstraklasa home game, beating GKS Katowice 1–0, with Eugeniusz Ptak scoring the sole goal. In the 1985–86 season, Zagłębie finished 12th, in 1986–87 they placed 8th, and in 1987–88 - 11th. To avoid relegation, the team from Lubin had to participate in the play-offs, and lost to Górnik Wałbrzych (1–2, 2–2).

After one year in the second division, Zagłębie returned to the Ekstraklasa in June 1989. Managed by Stanisław Świerk, they were the 1989–90 Ekstraklasa runners-up and won a spot in the 1990–91 UEFA Cup. In the first round, Zagłębie faced the Italian side Bologna, losing both games 0–1, 0–1.

In June 1991, managed by Marian Putyra, Zagłębie won the Polish championship, earning a spot in the 1991–92 European Cup, where it faced Brøndby. The Polish champions lost 0–3 in the first leg, and won 2–1 at home, to be eliminated. Among Zagłębie’s top players at that time were Romuald Kujawa and Adam Zejer, both top scorers of the Ekstraklasa in 1990 and 1991.

<text>Garbarnia Szczakowianka Jaworzno is a Polish football club based in Szczakowa, Jaworzno, Poland. The club is currently playing in the V liga Silesia.

==History==
The club was founded on 9 July 1923 as fusion of three local clubs: &quot;Kartagina&quot;, &quot;Rewia&quot;&#x27; and &quot;Sparta&quot;, under the name &quot;KS Szczakowianka&quot;. With the exception of the years 1948–1951, and brief few-day spell in 2007 (where it was met with widespread fan protests) the club has kept its &quot;Szczakowianka&quot; name throughout its existence, despite numerous minor name changes. They have spent the majority of their history in the 4th tier of Polish football, until the year 2000 they slowly started to make their way up the league pyramid.

In the 2001–02 season, they gained promotion to the second division after a double play-off match against RKS Radomsko. However, the game was shrouded in controversy, with Branko Rašić becoming the centre of attention with Radomsko claiming he was ineligible to play, as he was on loan from Victoria Jaworzno before the transfer window at the time. The case took several years to resolve, with numerous court proceedings, Polish FA involvement and even appeals to UEFA, Polish Olympic Committee, and debates in the Polish parliament. The case had widespread consequences, with many officials punished and removed from office as a result, and changes in law to prevent similar incidents in the future.

In the 2002–03 season, they played in the Ekstraklasa and were relegated after one year in the top-flight. Whilst it looked like they were about to win promotion immediately, they were convicted of match-fixing, along with several other clubs in widespread enquiry that shook Polish football.

After the two scandals, the club was heavily hit by sanctions with lack of confidence from supporters and sponsors alike in the management which led to the club being bankrupt by 2007. The team carried on relying on its reserve team in the fourth division, whilst the first team was dissolved and the disgraced management made redundant.

===Match-fixing scandal===
After a play-off scandal where Szczakowianka were convicted of match-fixing in the 2003–04 season, Szczakowianka played in second league starting with a ten-point deduction at the start of the season: Several matches were annulled as result.

<text>XCF, short for &quot;eXperimental Computing Facility&quot;, is the native image format of the GIMP image-editing program. It saves all of the data the program handles related to the image, including, among others, each layer, the current selection, channels, transparency, paths and guides.

Prior to version 4 (GIMP 2.10.0, released on 2018-04-27), the saved image data are compressed only by a simple RLE algorithm, but GIMP supports compressed files, using gzip, bzip2, or xz. The compressed files can be opened as normal image files. Since version 4, the image data can be compressed by zlib instead.

The XCF file format is backward compatible (all versions of GIMP can open earlier versions&#x27; files) and in some cases, forward compatible. For example, GIMP 2.0 can save text in text layers while GIMP 1.2 cannot. Text layers saved in GIMP 2.0 will open as ordinary image layers in GIMP 1.2. However, XCF files containing layer groups, a feature introduced in GIMP 2.7, cannot be opened with GIMP 2.6.

Despite some use in other programs (see §software support), the use of XCF as a data interchange format is not recommended by the developers of GIMP,

since the format reflects GIMP&#x27;s internal data structures and there may be minor format changes in future versions. Instead, a collaborative effort between the developers of GIMP and Krita is underway to design a standardised raster file format called OpenRaster (modelled on the OpenDocument format) for future use in both applications, and likely in others also.

GIMP&#x27;s &quot;Save&quot; dialog saves in the XCF format: starting with version 2.8, other formats with import/export support were moved to an &quot;Export&quot; dialog.

<text>The Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center (CCDC SC), formerly the United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, is a military research complex and installation in Natick, Massachusetts, charged by the U.S. Department of Defense with the research and development (including fielding and sustainment) of food, clothing, shelters, airdrop systems, and other servicemember support items for the U.S. military. It is a component unit of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command and is a tenant unit of the United States Army Natick Soldier Systems Center (SSC). The installation includes facilities from all the military services, not just the Army, and is so configured to allow cross-service cooperation and collaboration both within the facility and with the many academic, industrial and governmental institutions in the Greater Boston Area. 

The CCDC is subordinate to United States Army Futures Command (AFC) headquartered in Austin, Texas, which was activated in July 2018. Futures Command was formerly U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) at Aberdeen Proving Ground.

The SSC is sometimes called the Natick Army Labs, although this designation more properly refers to one of its tenant units, the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center.

==The installation==
The SSC occupies at its main Natick campus and has an additional in neighboring communities. The main campus is located to the northwest of Natick center and abuts upon Lake Cochituate.

Employee/tenant numbers total 1,957 (159 military personnel, 1,048 civilians and 750 contractors).

The SSC public relations office reports that the installation’s FY2006 funding totaled approximately $1 billion and that the facilities infuse more than $135 million annually into the local economy through installation salaries, utilities and local contracts.

The installation commander is a U.S. Army Brigadier General, currently BG Vincent Malone, who also serves as the Deputy Commanding General of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command.

==Mission==
The SSC includes facilities designed to research and test both materials (textiles, combat rations), advanced technologies and human performance (human research volunteers) under simulated environmental extremes (altitude, heat, cold, wind, etc.). The requirement for improved combat rations has led to groundbreaking developments in the field of food irradiation and freeze-drying techniques. Improved body armor, new military parachuting technology, and enhanced military garments designed for a variety of environments are all ongoing efforts.

==History==

Construction of the Quartermaster Research Facility at Natick, authorized by Congress in October 1949, began in November 1952. A year later, the QRF was redesignated as the Quartermaster Research and Development Center and four years later as the Quartermaster Research and Engineering Command.

July 1961 saw the activation of the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine at Natick and a year later the QREC was placed under the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC). In November 1962, the QREC was redesignated as Natick Laboratories and the following year the Food and Container Institute moved to Natick. July 1967 saw the Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility relocate to Natick.

Natick Laboratories became a subordinate element to the Troop Support Command in July 1973 and was redesignated two years later as the U.S. Army Natick Development Center and reassigned to the AMC. The NDC was redesignated the U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Command in January 1976 and assigned to the U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command. (The same month, AMC was redesignated the U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command (DARCOM).)

In September 1980, the NRDC was redesignated as the U.S. Army Natick Research &amp; Development Laboratories and three years later as the U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Center, a subordinate element of the U.S. Army Troop Support Command in St. Louis, Missouri. (DARCOM and TSC merged in July 1992 forging the U.S. Army Aviation &amp; Troop Command, St. Louis, Mo.)

In 1982, Natick Labs surrendered control of 3,100 acres in the Massachusetts towns of Hudson, Maynard, Stow and Sudbury to Fort Devens to become a field training facility. The land had been an ordnance supply depot during World War II. After being an Environmental Protection Agency &quot;superfund&quot; cleanup site in the 1990s it became the Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge.

In October 1992, the NRDC was redesignated the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, still a subordinate element of the ATC. A U.S. Army Soldier Systems Command (SSC) was activated at Natick in November 1994. Elements subsequently established at the SSC included the Sustainment &amp; Readiness Directorate (February 1995) and Product Manager-Soldier Support (October 1995); elements subsequently relocated to Natick included the Clothing and Services Office (October 1996; from Ft. Lee, Virginia) and Product Manager-Force Provider (June 1997). The Sustainment &amp; Readiness Directorate became the Integrated Material Management Center in October 1997. SSC merged with the Chemical Biological Defense Command to become the Soldier and Biological Chemical Command in October 1998. At this time the installation was renamed the United States Army Soldier Systems Center. At some time prior to January 2017 the installation was renamed Soldier Systems Center Natick.

<text>ŁKS Łódź (&quot;Łódzki Klub Sportowy Łódź&quot;; ) is a Polish sports club based in Łódź. They are best known for their football club but are represented in many sports such as basketball, volleyball, boxing, and in the past ice hockey, athletics, tennis, table tennis, swimming, cycling, fencing, chess, etc. The club is based at Władysław Król Municipal Stadium, at Aleja Unii Lubelskiej 2 in the West of Łódź.

This article focuses on the football club. Their nickname &quot;Rycerze Wiosny&quot; (&quot;Knights of Spring&quot;) was given to them due to their usually strong performances after the winter break in the league.

==History==

The club was founded in 1908. It was one of the founders of the Ekstraklasa, Poland&#x27;s top division.

During World War II, two pre-war players of ŁKS, Adam Obrubański and Alojzy Welnitz, were among Poles murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940.

ŁKS enjoyed greatest success in the 1950s and 1990s, when it reached the podium six times, including winning the championship title in 1958 and 1997–98. It also won the Polish Cup in 1957, and reached the final in 1994.

In March 2010, the city government sold the football team to a private investor, as the city could no longer afford to support the football team, particularly after several seasons in the top level Ekstraklasa, where expenses often exceeded the ticket revenue from the club&#x27;s small seating-capacity stadium.

In May 2013, at the conclusion of the second-tier 2012–13 I liga season, the private investor declared bankruptcy. The club survived when a partnership between fans and other local investors raised the necessary funds to enter the much more affordable amateur fifth-level IV liga in time for the 2013–14 IV liga season, competing against other local area teams in the Łódź group. The rebuilt club returned to the top division in 2019.

On 28 May 2023, ŁKS secured promotion to Ekstraklasa after a 1–1 draw against Arka Gdynia; this result also confirmed ŁKS as I liga champions. However, they were relegated to the second division after just one season back in the top flight.

== Facilities ==

In 2009 the new Atlas Arena was completed adjacent to the football stadium. It is an indoor arena and has already hosted international events in basketball, volleyball and boxing.

The City council, owner of the various ŁKS Łódź sports clubs, still intend to construct a brand new stadium on the site of the current football stadium. It was intended to be complete in time for UEFA Euro 2012, but now is expected to be finished in late 2013-early 2014. Although Łódź is not a Euro 2012 host city, it had been believed that a failure by Ukraine to be ready on time would lead to Poland hosting the entire tournament on its own and therefore requiring more host cities. There were four Polish host cities (Warsaw, Gdańsk, Poznań and Wrocław) involved in hosting the tournament. It was envisioned the new stadium would have approximately 34,000 seats, as required by UEFA. While the concept of a new stadium for ŁKS Łódź was being discussed in 2009, cross-town rival Widzew Łódź announced that they would not contribute to any such stadium, as they had imminent plans to renovate their own stadium (the Widzew Łódź plans were stalled for years, eventually opening the 18,000 seat Widzew Łódź Stadium in 2017). Support for the project was undermined by the successful re-call of the Łódź city president in early 2010. The city also announced a public auction for their stake in the club as they could no longer afford to cover the clubs loses. Owing to financial constraints and lack of demand from LKS fans, the conceptual plan for a new ŁKS Łódź stadium was scaled down to 16,500 in 2012.

As part of renovations, a new 3,000 seat arena was supposed to be built to complement the existing Atlas Arena. All work was expected to cost 218 million PLN.

All plans to provide the club with new facilities, however, were abandoned as of 2013, due to financial constraints and the bankruptcy of the club in May 2013.
However, with an upturn in the clubs fortunes, a new stadium is currently being built. One side was used during the 2019–20 Ekstraklasa season with the remainder of the ground set to be completed by 2021.

<text>Ruch Chorzów () is a Polish professional football club based in Chorzów, Upper Silesia. It is one of the most successful football teams in Poland, having won fourteen Polish Championships, and the Polish Cup thrice. As of the 2024–25 season, they compete in the I liga, after suffering relegation from the 2023–24 Ekstraklasa. 

Ruch&#x27;s home venue is the Ruch Chorzów Stadium, with a capacity of 9,300 seats. As it is currently under renovation, Ruch temporarily hosts their games at the Silesian Stadium with a capacity of 55,211 seats. The club is known for its Silesian identity. Ruch Chorzów has also had a very successful female handball team (9 times national champions).

== Names ==
==History==

The club was founded on 20 April 1920 in Bismarkhuta (German &quot;Bismarckhütte&quot;, historically &quot;Hajduki&quot;), one of the many heavily industrialised municipalities in the eastern part of Upper Silesia, a disputed province between Poland and Germany. The main incentive was an appeal of the Polish Plebiscite Committee a few months earlier that led to creation of around one hundred sport associations. It took place in between the first and second Silesian Uprisings, to which the name &quot;Ruch&quot; is a supposed cover reference. The Polish word ruch is however also a common noun for &quot;movement&quot;, not as strongly associated with Polishness as names of many other clubs established after the appeal (like Polonia, Powstaniec etc.). On the other hand, the club&#x27;s first match, a 3–1 win against Orzeł Józefowiec, was played on 3 May 1920, the day of the first Polish Constitution. After the Upper Silesia plebiscite and the third Silesian Uprising in 1921 Bismarkhuta became part of Poland and the Silesian Voivodeship. The municipality was renamed to &quot;Wielkie Hajduki&quot; on 1 January 1923, hence the club was known as Ruch Wielkie Hajduki until another merger into the town Chorzów (created in 1934 from amalgamation of &quot;Królewska Huta&quot;, &quot;Chorzów&quot; and &quot;Hajduki Nowe&quot;) in the early 1939, with a short period in 1923 after the fusion with the older local German club &quot;Bismarckhütter Ballspiel Club&quot;, when it was known as &quot;Ruch BBC Wielkie Hajduki&quot;. After the merger the team played its games on the former BBC&#x27;s pitch known as &quot;na Kalinie&quot;. The popular nickname of the club &quot;Niebiescy&quot; (&quot;The Blues&quot;) clung to the team already in the 1920s.

In autumn of 1920 Ruch won the promotion to the nascent Silesian &quot;Klasa A&quot; (see also: Lower Level Football Leagues in Interwar Poland). The Blues were third out of fourteen teams in its first season, unfinished due to the third Silesian Uprising. The next year Ruch won the championship of the Silesian &quot;Klasa A&quot; and represented the region in the 1922 Polish Football Championship. In 1924 the club finished second in the regional top league, behind AKS Królewska Huta, before 1924 considered German and known as &quot;Verein für Rasenspiele Königshütte&quot;, the first team Ruch had developed a local rivalry with. In 1925 the Silesian Klasa A did not play, instead &quot;Stanisław Flieger&#x27;s Cup&quot; took place, ultimately won by Ruch, which gave the side a start in the only interwar Polish Cup competition in 1926. On 4 July 1926 Józef Sobota, before 1920 a BBC&#x27;s player, became the first Ruch&#x27;s player (and the fourth from Upper Silesia) of the Poland national team, who also scored a goal (against Estonia). In the same year, two weeks after the national Cup Ruch won for the second time the regional Klasa A, firmly establishing itself as one of the strongest football clubs in this densely populated region and as such it was among the founding clubs of the Polish national league in 1927. In 1933 Ruch won its first Championship as the first side from Silesia, with all the players who were born not further as a few kilometers from the &quot;na Kalinie&quot; pitch. Thus the first truly golden era began. The local steel mill (since 1934 known as Huta Batory) began to financially support the side. In the winter of 1933 the most noteworthy players such as Edmund Giemsa, Teodor Peterek and Gerard Wodarz were joined by legendary Ernst Wilimowski, bought from 1. FC Kattowitz, who with Peterek and Wodarz were collectively nicknamed &quot;the three kings&quot; and helped to win another 4 championships (1934, 1935, 1936, 1938). On 1 November 1934 the club, as the last in the league, employed its first coach, Gustav Wieser. The side was also a leader in the unfinished season 1939. The successes rendered the club the most popular in the voivodeship and accelerated building of the new stadium in the years 1934-1935, the current Ruch Chorzów Stadium.

During the World War II German occupation of Poland in 1939, the club was officially discontinued but unofficially was simply renamed Bismarckhütter SV 99 and joined the Gauliga Oberschlesien in 1941. The club was officially re-established after the war. In 1947 Ruch won the regional championships. In 1948, under communist pressure (Stalinisation), the club was renamed Unia Chorzów, in 1955 it became Unia-Ruch, and finally in 1956 returned to the name Ruch. As Unia the club finished third in the first season of the reactivated national league in 1948 and in 1950 as the second team. In 1951 the club won the reactivated Polish Cup edition and were rewarded with the title of the National Champions (even though they were only sixth in the league). The next two years the club also won the title, first in 1952 after final against Polonia Bytom, another local bitter rival, and in 1953 after finishing the league on the top position. The most renowned player of that era was Gerard Cieślik, who dedicated his whole life to the club and became its icon.

The years 1957-1966 are considered a lost decade, completely overshadowed by the successes of the new biggest regional rival, Górnik Zabrze, even though the club won the championships in 1960. A record of its kind in the national football history as the team consisted of only 14 players, 11 of whom originated in the town of Chorzów. The turn of the tide came in the season 1967–68 when Ruch won the 10th championship title breaking Górnik Zabrze&#x27;s streak of five consecutive titles. Another golden era for &quot;the Blues&quot; arrived in the early 1970s with Michal Vičan as a coach. In 1972–73 the club finished second, in 1973–74 they won the only double in the history (the championship and the cup) and advanced up to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. In 1974–75 they again won the league and qualified to the quarter-finals of the European Cup. The most praised players of that times were Bronisław Bula, Zygmunt Maszczyk and Joachim Marx.

These successes were followed by a bad financial plight and mediocre results until 1978–79, when the club won its 13th Championship title. In the 1980s the club was one of the poorest in the national league. The worst came in the season 1986–87, when the club, the only one in the country which so far played all the seasons of the official national top league, was relegated to the second tier. Especially shifty were the circumstances of the relegation decider, against Lechia Gdańsk, when Ruch&#x27;s goalkeeper Janusz Jojko scored an infamous and bizarre own goal and the club lost the game 1–2. After one year Ruch returned to the top flight as winners of the seconed league and won the 14th Championship title, as the second freshly-promoted club in the national history (the first was Cracovia in 1937), a feat, especially as it was still one of the poorest clubs in the top tier and over half of the players were home-grown, including e.g. Dariusz Gęsior and the most renowned Krzysztof Warzycha, who was also, with 24 goals, the top scorer of the season.
After the political turnover in Poland in 1989, Ruch did not fare well for the first two seasons. The funds from the transfer of Krzysztof Warzycha to Panathinaikos ran out quickly. The team began to compete with the top teams first in 1991–92 finishing in the fifth spot, fourth the next year, furthermore the second team (&quot;Ruch II&quot;) reached the Polish cup final. Ruch was demoted for the second time in the history in the 1994–95 season. As before the stay in the second tier lasted one season. While playing in the second league Ruch won its third Polish Cup trophy. In 1998 Ruch reached the final of the UEFA Intertoto Cup and in the 1999–2000 season finished third in the league. The crisis came during the 2002–03 campaign, when the club was relegated from the top tier for the third time. In the following season, Ruch was in danger of being demoted to the third tier for the first time in history, however the club won the relegation play-offs against Stal Rzeszów (1–1, 2–0). In 2005, the club was restructured as a joint-stock company. The Blues won the promotion to the top flight in the 2006–07 season. In 2009, the side reached the Polish Cup final, the next year The Blues finished third in the league. The best season in the recent history was 2011–12, when Ruch was vice-champion (only 1 point behind the champions, Śląsk Wrocław) and reached the final of the national cup, which they lost 0–3 to Legia Warsaw.
In 2017, it was decided that for the first time in the history of Polish football, in accordance with the Restructuring Law, SA will initiate an accelerated arrangement procedure aimed at agreeing the terms of debt repayment with creditors. These proceedings were opened before the Katowice District Court on 23 June 2017. In these proceedings all 255 creditors were offered to reduce the debt, spread it into installments or convert the debt into club shares. On 30 November 2017 creditors gathered in court to decide whether or not to accept the offer. The majority agreed and the agreement was adopted, ultimately the agreement became final on 13 March 2018. According to the provisions of the agreement, Ruch is to repay PLN 8 million złoty within 5 years. Installments are spread over 400 thousand złoty every quarter.

Ruch started the 2017–18 season in Nice I liga with a six-point deduction for unpaid debts. After a disastrous season in which the Blues suffered heavy defeats, including 0–6 in a home match against Pogoń Siedlce on the club&#x27;s 98th anniversary, a 6–1 away defeat against Miedź Legnica and a 6–0 away loss to Wigry Suwałki, the club finished last in the league, being 11 points off the play-off place, which resulted in the first relegation to the third level in Ruch&#x27;s history.

Ruch ended the 2018–19 season in the II liga in last place, eight points off of safety. It was the third season in a row in which the Blues were relegated from last place in the table.

In 2020–21, Ruch dominated group III of the III liga and were promoted to the II liga, 11 points ahead of second placed Polonia Bytom.
Ruch finished the 2021–22 season in third place, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. In the semi-finals, the team faced Radunia Stężyca, which they beat 1–0 after a goal from Daniel Szczepan in the 118th minute. The final was played in Chorzów, where Ruch faced 5th placed Motor Lublin - on 29 May, Ruch won 4–0 and was promoted for the second season in a row, returning to the I liga for the first time since the 2017–18 season.

Ruch finished the 2022–23 season as runners-up, after defeating GKS Tychy 1–0 on the last matchday, with the sole goal scored again by Daniel Szczepan. In result, Ruch returned to Ekstraklasa after 7 years of absence, with a streak of three straight promotions.

However, Ruch were relegated back to the second division after just a single season back in the top flight, finishing the 2023–24 campaign in 17th and second-last.

==Crest==
Ruch Chorzów has a very specific crest and is one of the most recognizable football crests in Poland. There isn&#x27;t information who was the author of the prototype and in which year the crest was used for the first time. The oldest confirmed source is letterhead from 1929. The club colours are blue and white. They accompany the team from the very beginning of the club&#x27;s existence and already in the twenties it was written about Ruch - &quot;Niebiescy&quot; &quot;(en. The Blues)&quot;. This color has become the symbol of the club. Except for the emblem of Unia Chorzów (around 1949-1955), the shield of the crest has always been, more or less precisely, the blue Reuleaux triangle with the club&#x27;s full name on the rim. The white center of the sign is filled with an acronym. In the late 1980s, the monogram was decorated with thin lines, emphasizing the activity, militancy and mobility of the signet itself, and thereby reflecting the name of the club in a slightly expressive way (Ruch means Movement in English). In September 2007, it was decided to make a facelift of the logo, which was to be a sign of the continuous evolution of the brand of Ruch Chorzów. Shading was introduced to the sign in order to plasticize the drawing, give depth and spaciousness to the whole crest. In this way, they tried to show the spirit of nowadays and to gain the identity of a modern and attractive brand. However, trends for gradients quickly passed, while the crest in this version stayed for a long time and received many opponents. In 2021, after the jubilee year, starting its second century, the club decided to return to the most acceptable version of the crest among fans. 

&quot;Due to the lack of a consistent chronology of individual marks, the above listing of all crests with dates is approximate and conventional. The set above does not include jubilee signs.&quot;

== Upper Silesian symbolism ==
Ruch Chorzów proudly emphasizes its Silesian origin. The club is considered to be &quot;synonymous with Silesianess&quot; and has been called &quot;the most Silesian of Silesian clubs&quot;. On the stadium mast hangs the Upper Silesian flag, the stadium announcer often declares (en. Goal!) over the tannoy after goals scored, while the club mascot is named Adler, an anthropomorphic eagle, stylized as a golden eagle from the Upper Silesian coat of arms, who speaks only in the Silesian language. In fan stores there are many products with Upper Silesian symbols, on social media the club tags all posts with the hashtag (en. We are Ruch), and on the club’s television channel people often uses the Silesian language. An example of which may be the video promoting the match against Zagłębie Sosnowiec.
The symbolism of Upper Silesia is also often displayed from a sporting angle. On July 15, 2015, on Silesian Flag Day, the club presented new away kits for the 2015/2016 season. The yellow jersey, blue shorts and yellow socks alluded to the flag of Upper Silesia, intended to emphasize the Silesian character of Ruch, in whose traditions the club is so deeply rooted. The debut of the kits took place on the 80th anniversary of the stadium, and the team played in such a set for the first time in history. On that day, the coat of arms of the Silesian Voivodeship was additionally on the sleeve, and the announcer during the match spoke entirely in the Silesian language.
In the 2016–17 season, the team’s jerseys had a large coat of arms of Upper Silesia with the inscription &quot;Upper Silesia&quot;. Initially, only the first match was played in such kits, and all of them went to a charity auction, but after many requests from fans and the approval of the winners of these auctions, the emblem was printed on kits once again and from the 13th round they were in use until the end of the season.
On 23 April 2022, in a match against Radunia Stężyca, Ruch&#x27;s captain Tomasz Foszmańczyk put on a captain&#x27;s armband with the Upper Silesian flag for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

== Supporters and rivalries ==

Ruch&#x27;s popularity exploded in the 1930s and has remained strong ever since, especially in Upper Silesia. A specific subculture of (a name derived from &quot;szalik&quot; - scarf) developed in the 1970s, as elsewhere in the country, but regionally only after having first appeared among fans of Polonia Bytom. There are also hooligans (Psycho Fans, formed in the mid 1990s) and ultras (Nucleo Ultra &#x27;03 from 2003, replaced by Ultras Niebiescy, formed in 2008).

Expressions of Upper Silesian identity are often displayed in the form of golden-blue flags, on banners (like the controversial example, now banned, or (It&#x27;s us - Silesian Nation), or through chants.

Ruch&#x27;s supporters maintain friendships with fans of Widzew Łódź (since 2005), Elana Toruń, and Atlético Madrid. The biggest animosity is held against the followers of Górnik Zabrze (with whom The Great Silesian Derby is contested), GKS Katowice, Polonia Bytom (the oldest Silesian derby), Zagłębie Sosnowiec, Legia Warszawa, and Lech Poznań.
