<doc id="659983" wikidata="Q1378136" url="?curid=659983" title="Square (slang)">
<text>Square is slang for a person who is conventional and old-fashioned, similar to a fuddy-duddy. This sense of the word &quot;square&quot; originated with the American jazz community in the 1940s in reference to people out of touch with musical trends. Older senses of the term &quot;square&quot;, referring positively to someone or something honest and upstanding, date back to the 16th century.

==History==
The English word &quot;square&quot; dates to the 13th century and derives from the Old French &quot;esquarre&quot;. By the 1570s, it was in use in reference to someone or something honest or fair. This positive sense is preserved in phrases such as &quot;&quot;, meaning something done in an honest and straightforward manner, and &quot;square deal&quot;, meaning an outcome equitable to all sides. A West Country variant on the phrase, &quot;fairs pears&quot;, bears the same meaning and was first traced by Cecil Sharp in 1903 when visiting his friend (and lyrics editor) Charles Marson in Hambridge, South Somerset. 

The sense of &quot;square&quot; as a derogatory reference to someone conventional or old-fashioned dates to the jazz scene of the 1940s; the first known reference is from 1944. There it applied to someone who failed to appreciate the medium of jazz, or more broadly, someone whose tastes were out of date and out of touch. It may derive from the rigid motion of a conductor&#x27;s hands in a conventional, four-beat rhythm. It is used as both an adjective and a noun. A square contrasted with someone who was &quot;hip&quot;, or in the know.
The cub scout promise included the pledge &quot;to be square&quot; from the 1950s to the 1970s. In contemporary language, U.S. branches of the military refer to &quot;squared away&quot; to describe things that are ordered.

<text>Butano State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of California, showcasing the secluded redwood-filled canyon of Little Butano Creek, a tributary of Butano Creek in the Pescadero Creek watershed. Located in San Mateo County near Pescadero, the park was established in 1956.

==Features==
The park features 40 miles of hiking trails, 21 drive-in campsites and 18 walk-in campsites. Restrooms with running water are provided. Drinking water is available at the park in both the campground and in the day use areas. There are no showers. Butano also has a backpacking site along a trail up from the entrance. There is no water at the site but there is water nearby from seasonal streams.

Guided nature walk and weekend campfire programs are offered during the summer.

==Name==
Butano as a name has been applied to land grants, creeks, falls, ridges and forests. The earliest mention is by Padre Jaime Escudet in 1816. A &quot;butano&quot; is what early Californians called a drinking cup made from horn of a bull or other animal. A Native American origin is possible. It has been suggested that the word might mean &quot;meeting place&quot;.

<doc id="659999" wikidata="Q7320615" url="?curid=659999" title="Rhinoceros Sutra">
<text>The Rhinoceros Sutra also known as The Rhinoceros Horn Sutra (&#x27;;&#x27;; &quot;&quot; or ) is a very early Buddhist text advocating the merit of solitary asceticism for pursuing enlightenment as opposed to practicing as a householder or in a community of monastics. The goal of this was to become a pratyekabuddha, who wandered alone through the forest like a rhinoceros. It is possible this sutra is identified in the Chinese translation of the Mahāsāṃghika vinaya, and thus was also referred to with a Gāndhārī name similar to .

==Origins==
The &quot;Rhinoceros Sutra&quot; has long been identified, along with the and, as one of the earliest texts found in the Pāli Canon. This identification has been reinforced by the discovery of a version in the Gandhāran Buddhist texts, one of the oldest Buddhist (and, indeed, Indian) manuscripts extant. There is also a Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit version of it in the Mahāvastu. The early date for the text along with its rather unusual (within community-oriented Buddhism) approach to monastic life have led some scholars to suggest that it represents a holdover from a very early stage of Buddhism.

==Themes==
The scripture consists of a series of verses which discuss both the perils of community life and the benefits of solitude, almost all of which end with the admonition that seekers should wander alone like an Indian rhinoceros. The verses are somewhat variable between versions, as is the ordering of verses, suggesting a rich oral tradition that diverged regionally or by sect before being written down.

==Association with pratyekabuddhas==
Traditional commentaries on the text have unanimously associated the &quot;Rhinoceros Sutra&quot; with the Buddhist tradition of pratyekabuddhas.

In the &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot;, a 4th-century (CE) Mahayana work, Asaṅga describes followers of the Pratyekabuddhayāna as those who dwell alone like the horn of a rhinoceros, or as solitary conquerors (Skt. &quot;pratyekajina&quot;) living in a small group. Here they are characterized as utilizing the same canon of texts as the śrāvakas who follow the Śrāvakayāna, namely the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, but having a different set of teachings, the Pratyekabuddha Dharma.

==Naming controversy==
There is an ongoing dispute over whether the title, &quot;sword-horn&quot; sutra, is to be taken as a  compound (&quot;a sword which is a horn&quot;) or as a bahuvrīhi compound (&quot;one who has a sword as a horn&quot;). In the former case, the title should be rendered &quot;The Rhinoceros-Horn Sutra&quot;; in the latter case, it should be rendered &quot;The Rhinoceros Sutra.&quot; There is textual evidence to support either interpretation.

In general, Mahayana traditions in India took the title to refer to an Indian rhinoceros, which is a solitary animal. The Theravāda tradition tended toward the &quot;rhinoceros horn&quot; interpretation, but there is some variance between Theravāda commentators, with some referring to the image of a rhinoceros rather than a rhinoceros horn.

==Location in Buddhist Canons==
In the Sutta Pitaka, this Pali sutta is the third sutta in the Khuddaka Nikaya&#x27;s Sutta Nipata&#x27;s first chapter (&quot;Uragavagga&quot;, or the &quot;Snake Chapter,&quot; named after the chapter&#x27;s first sutta), and thus can be referenced in the Pali Canon as &quot;Sn 1.3.&quot;

<doc id="660004" wikidata="Q77242" url="?curid=660004" title="Theodor Billroth">
<text>Christian Albert Theodor Billroth (26 April 18296 February 1894) was a German surgeon and amateur musician.

As a surgeon, he is generally regarded as the founding father of modern abdominal surgery. As a musician, he was a close friend and confidant of Johannes Brahms, a leading patron of the Viennese musical scene, and one of the first to attempt a scientific analysis of musicality.

==Early life and education==
Billroth was born at Bergen auf Rügen in the Kingdom of Prussia, the son of a pastor. His father died of tuberculosis when Billroth was five years old. He attended school in Greifswald where he obtained his &quot;Abitur&quot; degree in 1848. Billroth was an indifferent student, and spent more time practicing piano than studying. Torn between a career as a musician or as a physician, he acceded to his mother&#x27;s wishes and enrolled himself at the University of Greifswald to study medicine, but gave up the whole of his first term to the study of music; Professor Wilhelm Baum, however, took him with him to Göttingen, and his medical career was fixed. He then followed Professor Baum to the University of Göttingen, and completed his medical doctorate at the Frederick William University of Berlin in 1852. Along with Rudolph Wagner (1805–1864) and Georg Meissner (1829–1905), Billroth went to Trieste to study the torpedo fish.

== Career in surgery ==
From 1853 to 1860 Billroth was an assistant in Bernhard von Langenbeck’s surgical clinic at the Charité in Berlin. There he was also apprenticed to Carl Langenbuch. In 1860, Billroth accepted an offer from the University of Zurich to become the Chair of Clinical Surgery, becoming director of the surgical hospital and clinic in Zurich. The beginning of his career in Switzerland was unpromising: during his first semester of teaching, he had only ten students, and he himself said that the income he received from his private practice was insufficient to pay for his morning cup of coffee. His reputation quickly grew however; Billroth had an infectious personality, attracting both students and surgical trainees to his ranks. He was loved by his students, and was an effective undergraduate as well as graduate teacher. Students flocked to his lectures, and with the cooperation of energetic colleagues, he was able to raise the Medical Faculty of Zurich to a prominent position among German speaking schools in only a few years.

While in Zurich, Billroth published his classic textbook &quot;Die allgemeine chirurgische Pathologie und Therapie&quot; (&quot;General Surgical Pathology and Therapy&quot;) (1863). At the same time he introduced the concept of audits, publishing all results, good and bad, which automatically resulted in honest discussion on morbidity, mortality, and techniques – with resultant improvements in patient selection.

He was appointed professor of surgery at the University of Vienna in 1867, in succession to Franz Schuh; there, he practiced surgery as chief of the Second Surgical Clinic at the &quot;Allgemeine Krankenhaus&quot; (Vienna General Hospital). Though he laid the foundation of his fame at Zurich, it was in Vienna, a larger and more conspicuous theater, that he established himself as the power that he was in the surgical world. A speech he gave in 1875, protesting influxes of Jewish medical students, has been counted as one of the first events in the development of Viennese political anti-Semitism.

During the Franco-Prussian War, Billroth did excellent work in the military hospital at Mannheim and Weissenburg, treating a variety of horrific battlefield injuries with aggressive and ambitious surgeries; he embodied his experience of war surgery in his &quot;Surgical Letters from Mannheim and Weissenburg.&quot; He was so impressed by the horrors of war that he was ever afterwards an ardent advocate of peace. On December 3, 1891, he delivered an address on the care of the wounded in war which made a profound sensation and led to large sums of money being voted by the Austrian legislative chambers for the provision of adequate means of succour for the wounded.

He did not limit himself to surgery only, and conducted extensive research on an ailment that affected many surgery patients at the time: wound fever. His treatise on wound fever, &quot;Untersuchungen über die Vegetationsformen von Coccobacteria septica&quot; (1874; “Investigations of the Vegetal Forms of &quot;Coccobacteria septica&quot;”) concluded that the cause was bacterial; Billroth was quick to use antiseptic techniques in his surgical practice, and the number of surgical patients afflicted with wound fever greatly decreased. With the threat of fatal surgical infections lessened through his work and others’, Billroth proceeded to turn his attention to surgery and the pioneering field of altering or removing organs that had previously been considered inaccessible.

An early adopter of the &quot;white coat&quot; (as shown in Seligmann&#x27;s c.1890 painting), Billroth was directly responsible for a number of landmarks in surgery; in 1872, he was the first to conduct an esophagectomy, removing a section of the oesophagus and joining the remaining parts together. In 1873, he performed the first laryngectomy, completely excising a cancerous larynx. He was the first surgeon to excise a rectal cancer and by 1876, he had performed 33 such operations. By 1881, Billroth had made intestinal surgery seem almost commonplace. But his most famous accomplishment is unquestionably the first successful gastrectomy for gastric cancer. On January 29, 1881, after many ill-fated attempts, Billroth performed the first successful resection for antral carcinoma on Therese Heller, who lived for almost 4 months and died of liver metastases. He accomplished this operation by closing the greater curvature side of the stomach and anastomosing the lesser curvature to the duodenum, in an operation that is still known as the Billroth I to this day.

Billroth&#x27;s literary activity was widespread, with the total number of published books and papers of which he was the author numbering about one hundred and forty. He collaborated with Franz von Pitha on a &quot;Textbook of General and Special Surgery&quot; (1882). To this, Billroth contributed the section on Scrofulosis and Tuberculosis, Injuries and Diseases of the Breast, Instruments and Operations, Burns, Frostbites, etc.

Billroth passed his restless intellectual spirit to numerous distinguished students, creating the &quot;Billroth School&quot; of followers. No aspect of his profession seemed to escape his intense scrutiny, be it research, teaching, administration, or nursing. He not only had something valuable to say about each but often saw to it that his ideas became concrete reality. In all the spheres he sought to influence, he was guided by a belief in the unity of science and art, and by confidence in his own ability to effect change.

Billroth was instrumental in establishing the first modern school of thought in surgery. He had radical ideas on surgical training, advocating a prolonged surgical apprenticeship on completion of medical studies consisting of preliminary work in hospitals followed by performing operations on cadavers and experimental animals. This would be followed by a 2-3 year assistantship in a surgical department with studies of the surgical literature and the acquisition of advanced practical skills. Among his disciples were the notable surgeons Alexander von Winiwarter, Jan Mikulicz-Radecki and John B. Murphy. William Halsted&#x27;s pioneer surgical residency program was greatly influenced by Billroth&#x27;s own methods of surgical education.

==Music==
Billroth was a talented amateur pianist and violinist. During his time in Zurich he regularly played string quartet with professional musicians such as Theodor Kirchner and Friedrich Hegar. In 1865 he met Brahms for the first time when the rising composer and pianist played Robert Schumann&#x27;s piano concerto and his own works in Zurich. After Billroth had moved to Vienna in 1867 they became close friends and shared many musical insights. Brahms frequently sent Billroth his original manuscripts in order to get his opinion before publication, and Billroth participated as a musician in trial rehearsals of many of Brahms&#x27; chamber works before their first performances. Brahms dedicated his first two string quartets, Opus 51, to Billroth.

Billroth and Brahms, together with the acerbic and influential Viennese music critic Eduard Hanslick, formed the core of the musical conservatives who opposed the innovations of Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. In the conflict, known as the War of the Romantics, Billroth supported Brahms, but was always fair and measured in his comments. &quot;Wagner was indeed a very considerable talent in many directions,&quot; he wrote in 1888.

Billroth started an essay called &quot;Wer ist musikalisch?&quot; (&quot;Who is musical?&quot;), which was published posthumously by Hanslick. It was one of the earliest attempts to apply scientific methods to musicality. In the essay, Billroth identifies different types of amusicality (tone deafness, rhythm-deafness and harmony-deafness) that suggest some of the different cognitive skills involved in the perception of music. Billroth died in Opatija, Austria-Hungary, before he could complete the research.

Excelling at both his vocation and his avocation, Billroth never saw science and music as being in conflict. On the contrary, he considered the two to complement each other. &quot;It is one of the superficialities of our time to see in science and in art two opposites,&quot; he wrote in a letter. &quot;Imagination is the mother of both.&quot;

==Honours==
In 1887 Billroth was made a member of the Austrian &quot;Herrenhaus&quot;, &quot;House of Lords&quot;; a distinction rarely bestowed on members of the medical profession. In 1888, Theodor Billroth was elected member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

<text>Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) is a method of examination of the eye. It uses the technique of confocal laser scanning microscopy for diagnostic imaging of the retina or cornea of the human eye.

As a method used to image the retina with a high degree of spatial sensitivity, it is helpful in the diagnosis of glaucoma, macular degeneration, and other retinal disorders. It has further been combined with adaptive optics technology to provide sharper images of the retina.

==Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy==

SLO utilizes horizontal and vertical scanning mirrors to scan a specific region of the retina and create raster images viewable on a television monitor. While it is able to image the retina in real time, it has issues with reflections from eye astigmatism and the cornea. Eye movements additionally can confound the data from SLO.

==Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy==

Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) is a technique used to measure living retinal cells. It utilizes adaptive optics to remove optical aberrations from images obtained from scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of the retina.

===History===

Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy developed as a method to view a distinct layer of the living eye at the microscopic level. The use of confocal methods to diminish extra light by focusing detected light through a small pinhole made possible the imaging of individual layers of the retina with greater distinction than ever before. However, using SLO for monitoring of individual retinal cells proved problematic because of optical aberrations created from the tissues of the anterior eye (specifically the cornea and lens). These aberrations (caused additionally by astigmatism and other factors affecting eye position) diminished lateral resolution and proved difficult to remove.

Adaptive optics was first attempted for SLO in the 1980s. This first attempt did not use wavefront-detecting technology with its deformable mirror and estimated aberrations through pre-measured factors such as astigmatism. However, this did not diffuse the small monochromatic aberrations resulting from light traveling through the anterior eye both into and out of the pupil during scanning. The invention and adaptation of the Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor for the apparatus produced images of the retina with much higher lateral resolution. The addition of microelectricalmechanical (MEMs) mirrors instead of larger, more expensive mirror deformable mirror systems to the apparatus made AOSLO further usable for a wider range of studies and for use in patients.

===Procedure===

The subject is placed in a dental impression mount fixed in a way to make it possible to manipulate the head in three dimensions. The subject&#x27;s pupils are dilated using a dilating agent to minimize fluctuations from accommodation. After the eyes are sufficiently dilated, the subject is told to fixate on a target while in the mount.

Once the subject is properly placed, wavefront correction and imaging takes place. A laser is collimated and then reflected off of a beam-splitting mirror. As in confocal SLO, light must pass through both a horizontal and a vertical scanning mirror before and after the eye is scanned to align the moving beam for eventual retinal faster images of the retina. Additionally, the light is reflected off of a deformable mirror before and after exposure to the eye to diffuse optical aberrations. The laser enters the eye through the pupil to illuminate the region it has been focused onto and light reflected back leaves the same way. Light returning from the mirrors passes through the first beam splitter onto another beam splitter where it is directed simultaneously toward a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and toward a Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor array. The light going toward the photomultiplier is focused through a confocal microscopy pinhole to remove light not reflecting off of the plane of interest and then recorded in the PMT. Light directed to the wavefront sensor array is split up by the lenslets in the array and then recorded onto a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera for detection of optical aberrations. These aberrations are then subtracted from the images recorded in the PMT to vastly increase lateral resolution.

===Applications===

A major use of this increased lateral resolution from AOSLO has been the ability to determine the spatial distribution of cone cells around the fovea. Not only can the spatial density of these cells be found for a variety of regions within the retina, but the anisotropy of these cells can also be calculated to determine the axial orientation of retinal cells in the living subject. This represents a major benefit over typical histological examination of small numbers of donated human eyes. AOSLO has also revealed significant decreases in foveal cone packing density for myopic eyes in comparison to emmetriopic eyes. This difference has been hypothesized to originate from a natural decrease in cone density with the increase in eye axial length associated with myopia. Abnormalities in photoreceptor structure in regions damaged by macular dystrophy have additionally been imaged by AOSLO. In these subjects, a dark area has been visualized within the macular lesion and morphologically abnormal photoreceptors have been visible on the lesion perimeter. Furthermore, scanning of subjects with cone dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) has shown significant changes in cone packing density for these subjects compared to those with normal retinas. This presents a possible future use of AOSLO in phenotype tracking and confirmation for subjects with diseased genotypes.

The imaging of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in patients with and without retinal disease has also proved possible with the use of AOSLO. With the loss of photoreceptor cells, background scattered light decreases and the light focused on the RPE can be analyzed more clearly. As the loss of RPE cells represents the primary pathology of macular degeneration, this provides a possible future avenue for tracking RPE degradation &quot;in vivo&quot;. This has been further proved with the analysis of lipofuscin granule autofluoresence in normal human and rhesus macaque retinas by AOSLO. Comparison of this fluorescence in normal and diseased retinas with simultaneous imaging of cone structure and cone/retinal pigment cell ratio analysis has been shown to be possible and in the future may allow for the tracking of retinal damage from retinal dystrophies. AOSLO has already been used in rhesus macaques to track light damage to the macula from particular wavelengths.

Additionally, AOSLO provides a greater degree of accuracy for eye tracking than possible before with other techniques. Because of the short scan time involved in AOSLO, eye motion itself represents an obstacle to taking images of the retina. Computational adjustments and modeling have been able to correct for aberrations caused by eye motion between frames. However, by tracking these aberrations based on changes to the retina between pictures, the effect of light on the individual orientation of the cone can be tracked. Research utilizing a visual stimulus and AOSLO eye tracking have yielded data on how the retina tracks movement at the microscopic level.

The high degree of specificity and the ability to focus the laser on different levels of the eyes with AOSLO has additionally allowed for real time tracking of blood flow in the eye. By injecting fluorescin into macaques before scanning, fluorescence adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (FAOSLO) can be utilized to image individual capillaries in the nerve fiber layer and determine the thickness of the nerve fiber layer itself. Vessel pattern and diameter for these capillaries have been measured throughout the regions scanned by FAOSLO. This has future applications for monitoring glaucoma patients who either have changes in nerve fiber layer thickness or alterations in vasculature from damage to the retina.

===Comparison to retinal dissection and other imaging techniques===

AOSLO represents an advantageous alternative to retinal dissection for a variety of reasons. Analysis of cone packing density before AOSLO was only possible on mounted eyes from eye donor banks. As this method could not measure changes to cones in living eyes, it could not be used to track retinal changes over time or eye movements. With the use of living subjects, AOSLO allows for these measurements as well as easier control of age and other confounding factors while maintaining similar anatomical results for cone packing density. Future clinical implications for AOSLO are also possible.

AOSLO compares favorably with other retinal imaging techniques as well. Fluorescein angiography uses injection of a fluorescein dye to image the back of the retina. It is a commonly used technique but it has a large number of side effects, including nausea in one fifth of patients and in some cases death from anaphylaxis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) represents a powerful clinical tool for monitoring retinal physiology in patients. OCT uses low coherence interferometry to differentiate tissues within the eye and create a cross section of a living patients’ retina non-invasively. It actually has greater axial resolution than AOSLO. However, AOSLO represents a method with much greater translational resolution than OCT and can thus be used to track minor lateral physical changes such as the effects of eye movements on the retina. A combination of AOSLO and OCT has recently been attempted in one apparatus to produce the first three-dimensional images of individual cone cells and illustrate the overall cone mosaic near the fovea at high speeds.

<text>The Big Picture is an American documentary television program which aired from 1951 to 1964. The series consisted of documentary films produced by the United States Army Signal Corps, Army Pictorial Service.

==Production==

The series was conceived by Albert Gannaway Jr and David Burkey, a former television producer who served with the Signal Corps in the Korean War. They saw it as a way to use film footage accumulated by the Army Pictorial Service, packaged in a way that would be attractive to commercial television. The first series of 13 episodes was broadcast on CBS in late 1951, with each episode about an aspect of the Korean War. It had a positive reception from audiences and the Army decided to expand the scope as a publicity tool. Army information units from around the world suggested topics with the Signal Corps filming all the segments. Topics varied and included military history, contemporary weaponry, training exercises, cooperation with allied forces, and Army sporting activities.

The half-hour weekly program was filmed on the Astoria stages, now Kaufman Astoria Studios, which is a historic movie studio located in the Astoria section of the New York City borough of Queens. The host was Army Master Sergeant Stuart Queen (1919–1981), a World War II veteran and Korean War combat broadcaster. Though Queen is referred to as both a host and narrator, he essentially introduced and linked segments that were narrated by others. Narrators for filmed segments included Audie Murphy, Lorne Greene, Robert Mitchum, Alexander Scourby, Walter Cronkite, Raymond Massey, and Ronald Reagan. In the 1950s, the series was shot on 35mm black-and-white negative, but by the 1960s it was using 16mm color negative.

It was eventually aired on 366 television stations on the CBS, ABC and DuMont networks and ran for 828 episodes. While the series as a regularly produced and scheduled program nominally ended in 1964, further episodes continued to be made on an irregular basis until 1971.
In addition to the various network schedulings between 1951 and 1964, the show was also widely syndicated, and it continued to air in syndication until 1971.

* TV 353 – Pictorial Report No. 26 – &quot;THE BIG PICTURE&quot; to cover Virginia township centennial and modern miracles of military science – For the first story in this pictorial report, the camera frames a picture of Fort Huachuca, Arizona, one of the most modern of all the Army&#x27;s installations. Here in this desolate country, surrounded by empty desert and mountains, the Army has found an ideal proving ground for newly developed electronic equipment. Viewers will see the testing of an amazing reconnaissance robot, the pilotless plane – the drone; the newly developed radio contained in an infantryman&#x27;s helmet and used under combat conditions; and the new all-weather flight control – a system of seeing in the dark. Fort Huachuca is a miracle testing ground, where 8,000 men and women are working to find new ways of protecting America. The second story is truly &quot;off beat&quot; for THE BIG PICTURE series. It concerns the farming community of Galax in Southern Virginia. Here is a township on the eve of its Centennial Jubilee volunteering its help through a Chamber of Commerce committee to form an Army Reserve training company that could march in the Centennial parade. It is a warm-hearted story of a people determined to keep American democracy safe. For they know that freedom is everybody&#x27;s business – and prove it on THE BIG PICTURE.

Their job: to create as realistic a maneuver enemy as possible so that combat training will approach the feeling of actual combat. In the first half of this most unusual THE BIG PICTURE, audiences discover the Aggressor Amy, Member Circle Trigon Party, have liberated large areas of the continental United States, but because of their success, THE BIG PICTURE viewers have been kept from the facts. This is a short documentary showing the liberation of the United States to date. After setting the pace for this program in the first 15 minutes, the camera examines closely this gigantic training aid of the Army. It is explained that at the close of World War II, a board of 100 combat-experienced American generals was formed to recommend training policies for the future. Out of these recommendations came the Aggressor concept of a maneuver enemy. The general mission of the Aggressor Army was threefold: First, to provide a realistic enemy for maneuver training; second, to provide realistic situations for intelligence training; third, to make sure that all American soldiers are aware that any future enemy will look and act differently from what they are accustomed to.

<doc id="660019" wikidata="Q3259505" url="?curid=660019" title="Convex polygon">
<text>In geometry, a convex polygon is a polygon that is the boundary of a convex set. This means that the line segment between two points of the polygon is contained in the union of the interior and the boundary of the polygon. In particular, it is a simple polygon (not self-intersecting). Equivalently, a polygon is convex if every line that does not contain any edge intersects the polygon in at most two points.

== Strictly convex polygon ==
A polygon is &quot;strictly&quot; convex if no line contains two of its edges. In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than &quot;or equal&quot; to 180 degrees, while in a strictly convex polygon all interior angles are strictly less than 180 degrees.

== Properties ==
The following properties of a simple polygon are all equivalent to convexity:
*Every internal angle is less than or equal to 180 degrees.
*Every point on every line segment between two points inside or on the boundary of the polygon remains inside or on the boundary.
*The polygon is entirely contained in a closed half-plane defined by each of its edges.
*For each edge, the interior points are all on the same side of the line that the edge defines.
*The angle at each vertex contains all other vertices in its edges and interior.
*The polygon is the convex hull of its edges.

Additional properties of convex polygons include:
*The intersection of two convex polygons is a convex polygon.
*A convex polygon may be triangulated in linear time through a fan triangulation, consisting in adding diagonals from one vertex to all other vertices.
*Helly&#x27;s theorem: For every collection of at least three convex polygons: if all intersections of all but one polygon are nonempty, then the intersection of all the polygons is nonempty.
*Krein–Milman theorem: A convex polygon is the convex hull of its vertices. Thus it is fully defined by the set of its vertices, and one only needs the corners of the polygon to recover the entire polygon shape.
*Hyperplane separation theorem: Any two convex polygons with no points in common have a separator line. If the polygons are closed and at least one of them is compact, then there are even two parallel separator lines (with a gap between them).
*Inscribed triangle property: Of all triangles contained in a convex polygon, there exists a triangle with a maximal area whose vertices are all polygon vertices. 
*Inscribing triangle property: every convex polygon with area formula_1 can be inscribed in a triangle of area at most equal to formula_2. Equality holds (exclusively) for a parallelogram.
*Inscribed/inscribing rectangles property: For every convex body formula_3 in the plane, we can inscribe a rectangle formula_4 in formula_3 such that a homothetic copy formula_6 of formula_4 is circumscribed about formula_3 and the positive homothety ratio is at most 2 and formula_9.
*The mean width of a convex polygon is equal to its perimeter divided by formula_10. So its width is the diameter of a circle with the same perimeter as the polygon.

Every polygon inscribed in a circle (such that all vertices of the polygon touch the circle), if not self-intersecting, is convex. However, not every convex polygon can be inscribed in a circle.

== Strict convexity ==
The following properties of a simple polygon are all equivalent to strict convexity:

*Every internal angle is strictly less than 180 degrees.
*Every line segment between two points in the interior, or between two points on the boundary but not on the same edge, is strictly interior to the polygon (except at its endpoints if they are on the edges).
*For each edge, the interior points and the boundary points not contained in the edge are on the same side of the line that the edge defines.
*The angle at each vertex contains all other vertices in its interior (except the given vertex and the two adjacent vertices).

Every non-degenerate triangle is strictly convex.

<text>James Patrick Seerey (March 17, 1923 – April 28, 1986) was an American professional baseball player. An outfielder, Seerey played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for seven seasons in the American League with the Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox. In 561 career games, Seerey recorded a batting average of .224 and accumulated 86 home runs and 261 runs batted in (RBI).

Born in Oklahoma and raised in Arkansas, Seerey played football and baseball in high school. After graduating, he joined the Cleveland Indians&#x27; farm system in 1941, and made his major league debut two-and-a-half years later. He was primarily a starting outfielder the next five seasons for the Indians, but led the league in strikeouts four times. He was traded partway through the 1948 season to the Chicago White Sox, and a month after being traded became the fifth player in major league history to hit four home runs in one game. The following season, he was sent to the minor leagues, and played a few seasons in the farm system for the White Sox before retiring.

==Early life and minor leagues==
Pat Seerey was born in Wilburton, Oklahoma, in 1923 to James and Marie Seerey. His family moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, when he was a child, and he played baseball for the Little Rock Boys&#x27; Club at Lamar Porter Field. He attended Little Rock Catholic High School, where he played baseball and American football, serving as the team&#x27;s starting fullback. After graduating from high school in 1941, he was signed by the Cleveland Indians. Shortly afterwards, he was classified as 4-F, meaning he would not be lost to the military during World War II.

Seerey started his minor league baseball career in 1941 with the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League. In one of his first appearances for the team, he hit for the cycle in a 15–4 victory against the Fond du Lac Panthers. In 104 games for Appleton that year, Seerey had a .330 batting average with 31 home runs and 117 runs batted in; the 31 home runs were a record for the Wisconsin State League at the time. The following season, Seerey played for the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Three-I League. In 117 games for the Raiders, he had a .303 batting average and 33 home runs. In 1943, Seerey was promoted to the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League, and played in 31 games over the first two months of the season. In early June, outfielder Hank Edwards broke his collarbone, and the Indians needed an extra outfielder on the roster; Seerey was promoted as a result.

==Cleveland Indians==
Seerey made his debut with the Indians on June 9, 1943. Almost immediately after his debut, he earned the nickname of &quot;people&#x27;s choice&quot; in media due to both his hitting ability and his &quot;willingness to challenge the brick walls of the stadium&quot;. He played in 26 games for the Indians on the season, and hit .222 in 72 at-bats. Entering the 1944 Cleveland Indians season, manager Lou Boudreau planned to use Seerey as the starting center fielder, as he had reported to spring training 25 pounds lighter and Boudreau felt that Seerey could improve on a weak area on the team&#x27;s roster. Seerey moved back to left field to begin the season; in his first game there on the year, he hit a three-run home run to give the Indians a 7–4 victory over the Detroit Tigers. A month into the season, Seerey was among the league leaders in runs batted in, which was attributed to better plate discipline, though his fielding in the outfield was still considered a liability. Partway through the season, Seerey&#x27;s playing time diminished, yet he remained the team leader in home runs for most of the season despite limited at-bats. He finished the season with 15 home runs, 39 runs batted in, and a league-leading 99 strikeouts in 101 games.

Entering the 1945 Cleveland Indians season, Seerey was re-classified as 1-A, and took a military examination during the offseason. He was not slated to join the military after the exam, and the season started with him on the roster as one of the team&#x27;s starting three outfielders, thanks in part to getting in shape after a strict diet during the offseason. He started off with hits in the first seven games of the season. A month into the season, Seerey hit his first two home runs of the season in a 7–3 loss to the New York Yankees. He followed that up in a mid-July game against the Yankees with three home runs and eight runs batted in, becoming the fourth Indians player to hit three home runs in a game in a 16–4 Indians win. He spent the second half of the season in and out of the starting lineup due to his inconsistent hitting; manager Boudreau felt that occasional rest days would increase his consistency. In a career-high 126 games, Seerey hit .236 with 14 home runs and 97 strikeouts, which again led the league.

After getting married in early 1946 to Jeanne Dillinger, Seerey started the 1946 Cleveland Indians season working with Boudreau to fix his hitting, as his lunge when he swung the bat was causing him to strike out too often and not hit enough home runs. The change worked, as by the start of July Seerey had a team-leading 11 home runs. His second-half performance included a doubleheader against the Chicago White Sox where he hit a home run in each game; the second home run landed in the upper deck of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, a feat that at the time had only been matched by fellow Indians outfielder Jeff Heath. He finished the season with a .225 batting average, 26 home runs, 62 RBIs, and 101 strikeouts. The 26 home runs were fourth in the league, and for the third straight year Seerey led the league in strikeouts.

Indians catcher Jim Hegan and Seerey spent the offseason improving their hitting, attending batting school led by Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby; Hornsby concentrated primarily on improving Seerey&#x27;s timing to help him to hit the ball more frequently. In spring training games, Seerey had nine home runs, and expectations were high for him; Boudreau gave him the starting job in left field for the opener against the White Sox. Through the first month of the season, Seerey had six home runs, but his performance worsened as the season went on. At the end of June, Seerey was removed from the starting lineup and replaced by both Dale Mitchell and Hank Edwards; he spent the rest of the season playing part-time. He finished the season with a .171 batting average and 11 home runs in 82 games.

After the 1947 season ended, Indians owner Bill Veeck put Seerey on a strict diet and exercise regimen for the offseason, stating that he had to lose 35 pounds if he wanted to remain on the team. By the start of spring training, he had reached his goal of 195 pounds, and felt like he had an easier time swinging the baseball bat as a result. After a good month of spring training, Boudreau named him the starter in right field for the 1948 season, saying that &quot;he&#x27;ll be in there until he stops hitting.&quot; Shortly afterwards, Seerey was removed from the starting lineup, and he ended up playing 10 games for the Indians before being traded. On June 2, Seerey was traded with Al Gettel to the White Sox for Bob Kennedy due to his inconsistency as well as an overstocked group of outfielders on the roster.

==Chicago White Sox and later life==
Seerey was named the starting left fielder upon joining the White Sox, a position he held the rest of the season. Through his first 12 games, Seerey had 16 RBIs. On July 18, Seerey made history, becoming the fifth player to hit four home runs in one game, doing so in an 11-inning, 12–11 win over the Philadelphia Athletics. Seerey homered in three successive innings (fourth through sixth), hitting his first two off starting pitcher Carl Scheib and the third off reliever Bob Savage. His fourth home run, in the 11th off Lou Brissie, gave the White Sox the win. On that day, Seerey went 4-for-6 with seven runs batted in. In 105 games, 95 with the White Sox, Seerey had a .231 batting average, 19 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 102 strikeouts; he led the league in strikeouts for the fourth time.

The White Sox brought on new manager Jack Onslow to begin the 1949 Chicago White Sox season. He had a problem with Seerey, who arrived overweight to spring training, and did not consider him worthy of practicing with the other players until he got the weight back down. After playing in four games for the Sox, his last coming on May 7, Seerey was sent to the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, ending his major league career. He played for four minor league teams in 1949: Los Angeles, the Newark Bears, the Kansas City Blues, and the San Antonio Missions.

Seerey spent 1950 with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Western League. Partway through the season, he broke the league&#x27;s home run record of 30, and went on to hit 44 for the Sky Sox over the course of the season. He then finished the season with the Memphis Chickasaws, playing 136 total games with both teams. Seerey split most of the 1951 season between Memphis and Colorado Springs. In one game with the Sky Sox in June, Seerey had two grand slams and nine RBIs in a game, both league records at the time. He ended the season with the Tampa Smokers, and had 28 home runs in 113 between the three teams.

In 1952, Seerey joined a semi-professional baseball team in Guelph, Ontario. With them, he had 11 home runs and a .253 batting average, and retired at season&#x27;s end. The 11 home runs were the highest in the league that season. After retiring, Seerey became a janitor in the St. Louis public school system. He died in Jennings, Missouri, from lung cancer on April 28, 1986, at the age of 63.

<doc id="660026" wikidata="Q2285395" url="?curid=660026" title="Decibel watt">
<text>The decibel watt (dBW or dBW) is a unit for the measurement of the strength of a signal expressed in decibels relative to one watt. It is used because of its capability to express both very large and very small values of power in a short range of number; e.g., 1 milliwatt = −30 dBW, 1 watt = 0 dBW, 10 watts = 10 dBW, 100 watts = 20 dBW, and 1,000,000 W = 60 dBW.

:formula_1

and also

:formula_2

Compare dBW to dBm, which is referenced to one milliwatt (0.001 W).

A given dBW value expressed in dBm is always 30 more because 1 watt is 1,000 milliwatts, and a ratio of 1,000 (in power) is 30 dB; e.g., 10 dBm (10 mW) is equal to −20 dBW (0.01 W).

In the SI system the non SI modifier decibel (dB) is not permitted for use directly alongside SI units so the dBW is not directly permitted but 10 dBW may be written 10 dB (1 watt).

<text>Big Town is a popular long-running radio drama featuring a corruption-fighting newspaper editor initially played from 1937 to 1942 by Edward G. Robinson in his first radio role, with echoes of the conscience-stricken tabloid editor he had played in the film &quot;Five Star Final&quot;. Edward Pawley played the lead role longer, 1943–52, in plots that made the editor more of a hands-on crime-fighter. During the later Pawley years, Big Town was adapted to film and television series, and a comic book published by DC Comics.

==Radio==
The radio program aired from October 19, 1937, to June 25, 1952. It was produced by William N. Robson and Crane Wilbur, and written by Jerry McGill. Theme music was by Fran Frey. Edward G. Robinson had the lead role of Steve Wilson, crusading editor of the &quot;Illustrated Press&quot;, from 1937 to 1943. Claire Trevor was Wilson&#x27;s reporter sidekick &quot;Lorelei,&quot; with Ona Munson taking over that role in 1939. The female lead evolved from the initial script&#x27;s description as &quot;the society editor who writes under the name of &#x27;Lorelei&#x27;&quot; to star crime reporter &quot;Lorelei Kilbourne,&quot; with no hint that her first name was a stylized byline. She provided the tabloid-minded Wilson with a conscience in the early episodes, not unlike the editor&#x27;s secretary in Robinson&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;Five Star Final&quot; in 1931. 

Edward J. Pawley portrayed Steve Wilson from 1943 until 1952 when Walter Greaza was heard as Wilson in the final episodes. Fran Carlon played Lorelei to Pawley&#x27;s Wilson from 1943 to 1952. 
During the period in which Pawley starred, &quot;Big Town&quot; was rated No. 1 among all of the reporter-type drama series on radio. It was also rated in the top 12 among all radio programs broadcast and had a listening audience rated between 10 and 20 million people.

Ken Niles was the announcer.

==Film==
Four films based on the radio series were made by Paramount Pictures&#x27; Pine-Thomas Productions studio: &quot;Big Town&quot; (1947), &quot;I Cover Big Town&quot; (1947), &quot;Big Town After Dark&quot; (1947), and &quot;Big Town Scandal&quot; (1948). All four films starred Phillip Reed as Wilson and Hillary Brooke as Lorelei, all were based on radio- and/or screenplays by Maxwell Shane, and all were produced and directed by William C. Thomas.

==Television==
When &quot;Big Town&quot; moved to television, the program was telecast live, but in 1952 the production switched to film after the move from New York City to Hollywood. The television series ran on CBS from 1950 through 1954, continuing on NBC from 1955 through 1956. Repeat episodes aired on the DuMont Network beginning on February 6, 1953, under the title &quot;City Assignment&quot;, while &quot;Big Town&quot; was still showing first-run episodes on CBS. Reruns were also shown under the titles &quot;Heart of the City&quot;, &quot;Headline&quot;, and &quot;Byline Steve Wilson&quot;.

The stories revolved around &quot;The Illustrated Press&quot;, the city&#x27;s largest newspaper, and the people who worked for it, most particularly managing editor Steve Wilson (played by Patrick McVey from 1950 to 1954 and by Mark Stevens from 1954 to 1956). Five actresses had the role of reporter Lorelei Kilbourne. In its sixth and final season, the series would adopt the documentary style made famous by &quot;Dragnet&quot;, right down to Stevens producing, writing, and directing most of the episodes.

Jack Gross and Philip Krasne produced the program in 1952.

==Television ratings==
*1950–1951: #21
*1951–1952: #15
*1952–1953: out of the top 30
*1953–1954: out of the top 30

==Comic book==
DC&#x27;s &quot;Big Town&quot; comic book ran 50 issues, from January 1951 to March–April 1958. The comic book was edited by Whitney Ellsworth, and the contributing artists included Dan Barry, Carmine Infantino, Gil Kane, John Lehti, Manny Stallman and Alex Toth, with most of the later scripts written by John Broome.

<doc id="660034" wikidata="Q582053" url="?curid=660034" title="The Big Valley">
<text>The Big Valley is an American Western television series that originally aired from September 15, 1965, to May 19, 1969 on ABC. The series is set on the fictional Barkley Ranch in Stockton, California, from 1884 to 1888. The one-hour episodes follow the lives of the Barkley family, one of the wealthiest and largest ranch-owning families in Stockton, led by matriarch Victoria Barkley (Barbara Stanwyck), her sons Jarrod (Richard Long) and Nick (Peter Breck), daughter Audra (Linda Evans), and their half-brother Heath (Lee Majors). The series was created by A.I. Bezzerides and Louis F. Edelman, and produced by Levy-Gardner-Laven for Four Star Television.

== Plot synopsis ==
The series begins about 6 years after the death of the family patriarch, Thomas Barkley. Although he is never shown in the series (other than a painting and a statue), the character of Thomas Barkley is referred to as a major plot point many times. The character of Heath Barkley is introduced in episode one as the illegitimate son of Tom Barkley. His presence and claim to the Barkley name is the focus of many of the dramatic plots in season one.

==Cast and characters==

===Main===


*Victoria Barkley, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, the widow of Thomas Barkley, was the head of the wealthy, influential Barkley family, who lived in 19th-century Stockton in California&#x27;s Central Valley. She was the main character of the series. Victoria Barkley was the owner and head of the Barkley ranch. In fact, Stanwyck&#x27;s refusal to portray Barkley as fragile was controversial at the time. Barkley&#x27;s husband Tom had been killed 6 years before the beginning of the series. Victoria Barkley loved and was proud of all her children, including her late husband&#x27;s illegitimate son Heath, to whom she would refer as &quot;my son&quot;. Stanwyck, who went from the refined, elegant lady of the manor to a jean-clad cowgirl as tough as any cowboy, appeared the most, in 103 of the 112 episodes. Her episodes were often surprisingly hard-hitting, seeing her character either locked away in a lunatic asylum to prevent her testifying as eyewitness at a murder trial (&quot;Down Shadow Street&quot;), taken prisoner in a prison wagon to replace a dead female convict (&quot;Four Days to Furnace Hill&quot;), impersonating a thief to go undercover at a women&#x27;s prison to report on conditions there (&quot;Alias Nellie Handley&quot;), or trapped underground following a cave-in (&quot;Earthquake&quot;).
*Jarrod Thomas Barkley, the eldest son, was a respected attorney-at-law. Richard Long played the role of the educated, refined, and calmest of the Barkley sons, who handled all of the family&#x27;s legal and business affairs. While Jarrod, a skilled lawyer, preferred the law to settle disputes, he was known to resort to frontier justice and violence when necessary. He was briefly married in one episode (&quot;Days of Wrath&quot;), only to see his new wife murdered with a bullet intended for him. An enraged Jarrod lost his calm and genteel manners, then relentlessly tracked down the killer. He was in the midst of killing him with his bare hands before he was stopped by Nick and Heath. Jarrod was a veteran of the American Civil War. He served as a cavalry officer in the Union Army. He commanded a cavalry troop of black soldiers as referenced in the episode &quot;The Buffalo Man&quot;. Long appeared in 98 of the 112 episodes.
*Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Jonathan Barkley, the hot-tempered younger son, was portrayed by Peter Breck. Nick managed the family ranch. He wore a black leather vest, large black hat, and black leather gloves, and was distinguished by his brawling ways and loud demeanor. Nick had served as a soldier in combat in the Union Army during the Civil War as referenced in the episode &quot;Forty Rifles&quot;. He was always ready for a fight, and at times would fight with his brothers, as well. Underneath his gruff exterior, he was fun-loving, had a great sense of humor, was warm and caring, and loved his family deeply. Breck appeared in 98 of the 112 episodes.(Several years prior to starring in &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, Breck starred in his own series for Four Star Television, &quot;Black Saddle&quot;, which aired on NBC).
*Audra Barkley, played by Linda Evans, was Victoria&#x27;s only daughter. Audra was somewhat self-absorbed, bold, and forward. Far from demure, she performed daring stunts and rode astride, like her brothers. Like Nick and Jarrod, Audra was initially leery of Heath&#x27;s story that he was their father&#x27;s son. Early, she attempted to seduce Heath, so as to expose him as a fraud, but was unsuccessful. As the series progressed, Audra and Heath formed a very close brother-and-sister bond. Audra also had a caring side, as seen by her tending to children at the local orphanage. A few episodes dealt with her romances, and one notable episode was &quot;My Son, My Son&quot; in which Robert Walker, Jr., guests as a suitor who proves to be mentally unstable. During the series&#x27; final two seasons, Evans&#x27; appearances were reduced because she wanted to spend more time with her husband John Derek. Evans appeared the least, in 82 of the 112 episodes.
*Heath Barkley was the illegitimate son of Victoria&#x27;s late husband, and he had to literally fight his way into the Barkley home. Lee Majors portrayed even-tempered but rough-and-tumble Heath, who was often angry and aggressive throughout the early episodes due to his belief that Tom Barkley had abandoned his real mother after she became pregnant, as well as the resistance he initially received from some of his new siblings. In truth, Tom Barkley never knew about Heath, as Heath&#x27;s mother had never told him, and never told Heath until she was on her deathbed (as revealed in the third episode of season one, &quot;Boots with My Father&#x27;s Name&quot;.) Heath gradually gained acceptance from the rest of the Barkley clan as the first season progressed, until he became as much a &quot;Barkley&quot; as the rest of the family, and his love for them became equal. Heath came to call Victoria &quot;Mother&quot; when speaking to her directly and about her with his siblings. In the episode &quot;Boots with My Father&#x27;s Name&quot;, Heath told Victoria, &quot;you know that there isn&#x27;t anything that I wouldn&#x27;t do for you,&quot; indicating how deeply he cared for Victoria. Although Nick was initially leery of Heath and felt he had to test Heath&#x27;s mettle, Heath proved himself worthy of Nick&#x27;s acceptance, and eventually Nick seemed to grow even closer to Heath than he was to Jarrod, perhaps in a sense due to Heath having more in common with him than did Jarrod. In &quot;The Lost Treasure&quot;, the series&#x27; season-two premiere, one of a few episodes taken out of the show&#x27;s initial syndication runs, Heath met Charlie Sawyer (comic Buddy Hackett in a rare dramatic turn), a con man who claimed to be his actual father (the final moments show him admitting he did romance Heath&#x27;s mother, but left her years before she gave birth). In the same episode, Beah Richards returns as Hannah, the black quasinanny who helped raise Heath with his mother. Heath was a veteran of the Civil War as referenced in the episode &quot;The Guilt of Matt Bentell&quot;. He served as a soldier in the Union Army in combat operations in New Mexico, and was held as a prisoner of war for 7 months by Confederate forces. Heath was also established in the episode &quot;The Death Merchant&quot; as having been involved in the Lincoln County War (1878), where he came to know the hired killer &quot;Handy&quot;, who had tracked down and killed Tom Barkley&#x27;s murderer, but who is known by Heath as a merciless killer who changed sides - or played both sides - whenever the money was good. Majors appeared in 97 of the 112 episodes.

In addition to the Barkley family members, the episode plots typically revolved around morally conflicted protagonists and antagonists, a common theme in the mythology of the American West in the 19th century.

===Recurring===
*Silas (Napoleon Whiting), the Barkley&#x27;s majordomo, appeared 35 times. In several episodes, his character showed the trauma of slavery (&quot;Joshua Watson&quot;), life for blacks after the Civil War (&quot;The Buffalo Man&quot;), and meaning in his own work for the family (&quot;Miranda&quot;).
*Sheriff Fred Madden (Douglas Kennedy) appeared in 20 episodes. 
*Eugene Barkley (Charles Briles), the youngest Barkley son and a medical student studying at Berkeley. Like his older brothers, he was known to have a temper as seen in the season-one episode &quot;Boots with My Father&#x27;s Name&quot;. He appeared in eight first-season episodes. Then, he was drafted into the Army. Only once was his name ever mentioned again.

==Episodes==


== Background and production ==

===Background===
The TV series was based loosely on the Hill Ranch, which was located at the western edge of Calaveras County, not far from Stockton. The Hill Ranch existed from 1855 until 1931 and included almost 30,000 acres, and the Mokelumne River ran through it. The source is from an episode in which Heath is on trial in a ghost town with another man (played by Leslie Nielsen), and tells the judge how much land they have. Lawson Hill ran the ranch until he was murdered in 1861. His wife Euphemia (&quot;Auntie Hill&quot;) then became the matriarch. During their marriage, they had four children, one daughter and three sons. Today, the location of the ranch is covered by the waters of Camanche Reservoir. A California state historical marker standing at Camanche South Shore Park mentions the historic ranch.

In the first episode, titled &quot;Palms of Glory&quot;, the grave of Thomas Barkley (1813–1870) is shown after he is mentioned to have fought the railroad 6 years before. Later in the same episode, Frank Braun reminds Nick, Jarrod, and Eugene, &quot;Six years ago, your daddy and mine fought and died for this,&quot; indicating the year is 1876. The episode &quot;The Odyssey of Jubal Tanner&quot; gives conflicting information. Audra states that her father died 6 years ago, which would—per &quot;Palms of Glory&quot;—point to 1876, but Jubal seems to imply that he has been gone 30 years since his wife Margaret Tanner&#x27;s death, her grave marker showing that she had died in 1854, which would put the year around 1884. In the second-season episode &quot;Hide the Children&quot;, Nick makes reference that President Ulysses Simpson Grant is in the White House. Grant&#x27;s term of office was from March 4, 1869, to March 4, 1877. In the fourth- and final-season episode &quot;They Called Her Delilah&quot;, the telegram Jarrod received from Julia Saxon dated April 27, 1878, can be seen on screen. In the fourth-season episode &quot;The Prize&quot;, Heath buries the wife of an outlaw, adding a grave marker dated May 5, 1878. In the episode &quot;The Jonah&quot;, the band at a town dance can be heard playing Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Emperor Waltz&quot; or &quot;Kaiser-Walzer&quot;. The waltz was first performed in Berlin on October 21, 1889, which, by the time it would have reached the American West, would indicate a time period of 1890 or later, much later than other historical references in the show.

===Filming===
While &quot;The Big Valley&quot; is set primarily in and near the city of Stockton, the filming of the series took place in Southern California. It was partially filmed in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California.

Wilfred M. Cline, Technicolor associate cinematographer on &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), was director of photography for several &quot;Big Valley&quot; episodes, together with Chas E. Burke. Due to similarities in appearance, it is sometimes believed that the &quot;Tara&quot; set from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was repurposed for use as the Barkley family home in &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, but it was actually the set constructed for &quot;The Kentuckian&quot; that was used.

===Music===
The theme music was composed by George Duning, who scored the pilot and 58 episodes; Lalo Schifrin was responsible for the third season, and Elmer Bernstein for the fourth. According to IMDB.com, Joseph Mullendore wrote music for two episodes, while Herschel Burke Gilbert and Rudy Schrager scored one each. Paul Henreid, of &quot;Casablanca&quot; fame, directed a number of episodes.

The series&#x27;s main title theme and primary incidental music were composed by George Duning and feature sweeping musical elements highly reminiscent of classic American cinematic Westerns. For at least the first pilot episode, the theme music starts with a more relaxed woodwinds introduction leading into the title refrain at a moderate tempo. For the remainder of season one, the tempo is increased and the intro is shortened, with much more aggressive phrasing. For seasons three and four, the main theme was reworked again, with a much more brass-heavy orchestration. The final refrain (when Miss Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s credits are shown), includes an underlying Spanish rhythm outlined with tambourine that is similar to that of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; main title. Therefore, at least three versions of the theme song were recorded for the series.

In 1966, a soundtrack album was released in both monoaural and stereo versions, featuring suites of various music cues from the series, re-recorded for the LP release (ABC-Paramount; ABC 527). The album featured the iconic main theme song, but at slower tempos, giving them a more cinematic mood. To date, the album has not been re-released on compact disc or streaming. In 1980, the LP was reissued on vinyl on MCA Records for the Japanese market.

== Reception ==

===Popularity===

Despite the series&#x27; popularity, its ratings never made the top 30 in the yearly ratings charts. &quot;The Big Valley&quot; was cancelled in 1969 as the TV Western craze began to fade, and to make room for more modern series. In Ella Smith&#x27;s 1973 biography, &quot;Starring Miss Barbara Stanwyck&quot;, Smith noted that &quot;The Big Valley&quot; had been cancelled by ABC mainly due to a poor time slot. In better times, the series had been enough of a hit to outlive various time-slot rivals during its run (mainly on Mondays at 10 pm), including &quot;The Jean Arthur Show&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, and &quot;I Spy&quot;. According to &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine (September 27, 1965), its debut episode (actually Wednesday at 9 pm, where the series aired for half the season) placed 39th in the Nielsen ratings for the week of September 13–19, 1965.
&quot;The Big Valley&quot; also was ranked as one of the top-five favorite new shows in viewer TVQ polling (the others were &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, and &quot;F Troop&quot;). Early into its second season, &quot;The Big Valley&quot; was still a mid-range performer, placing 47th out of just 88 series during the week of October 28, 1966, which was higher than such shows as &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, and &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. Even so, &quot;The Big Valley&quot; was popular enough to warrant at least three &quot;TV Guide&quot; covers. It also acted as a launching pad for two projected spin-offs from special episodes. A 1968 episode guest-starring Van Williams was meant to lead to a &quot;Rifleman&quot;-like series titled &quot;Rimfire&quot;. A March 1969 episode, &quot;The Royal Road&quot;, guest-starring heartthrob Sajid Khan as a young rogue, was also hoped to lead to a series, but by that year, the rising popularity of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; — and vocal complaints by Joey Bishop, ABC&#x27;s late-night talk show host, that the show&#x27;s faltering ratings were not helping to provide his program with a proper lead-in — ultimately led to the drama&#x27;s demise. In syndication, &quot;The Big Valley&quot; proved exceptionally popular in the United States, Europe, and Latin America.
In the comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), the wacky air traffic controller Johnny, played by Stephen Stucker, paid homage to &quot;Big Valley&quot;″s penchant for big drama in one of his many asides. After Lloyd Bridges&#x27; character frets about a pilot who cracked under pressure, Johnny says: &quot;It happened to Barbara Stanwyck!&quot; and &quot;Nick, Heath, Jarrod – there&#x27;s a fire in the barn!&quot; &quot;The Big Valley&quot; also has seeped into the darker cinematic subconscious. In &quot;Bug&quot;, an acclaimed 2006 thriller starring Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon as drug addicts, their characters spiral into a hallucination that leads them to imagine tiny bugs have invaded their dwelling, with one referring to the little critters as &quot;matriarchal aphids&quot; that act &quot;like Barbara Stanwyck in &quot;Big Valley&quot;.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
In 1966, for her first season as Victoria Barkley, Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy for lead actress in a drama series. She was nominated two more times (1967 and 1968) for her work in &quot;The Big Valley&quot; and earned three Golden Globe nominations as Best TV Star for the part, as well (1966, 1967, 1968). On March 15, 1967, Stanwyck was named favorite TV actress at the &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine awards, which aired as a special episode of &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; (David Janssen of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; was named favorite TV actor). Richard Long helped present Stanwyck her Gold Medal at the event.

&quot;The Big Valley&quot; was also recognized during its run for its polished production. In 1966 and 1968, the American Cinema Editors named &quot;Valley&quot; the year&#x27;s Best Edited Television Program (for the episodes &quot;40 Rifles&quot; and &quot;Disappearance&quot;, respectively).

==Adaptations==

===Comic book===
Dell Comics published a short-lived comic book for six issues in 1966-69. (The last issue reprinted the first, and came out two years after issue #5). All issues had photo covers.

===Film===
Several episodes have been combined into concurrent-running feature-length TV movies, while the notable two-part episodes, &quot;Legend of a General&quot; and &quot;Explosion!&quot;, have also been made into TV movies. These have been issued on DVD as a box set, alongside seasons one and two.

In July 2009, it was reported in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; that filmmakers Daniel Adams and Kate Edelman Johnson were producing a feature adaptation of &quot;The Big Valley&quot; with production to begin in April 2010 in New Mexico and Michigan. In 2012, the film, initially intent to star Susan Sarandon, and then Jessica Lange as Victoria Barkley, was placed on indefinite hold after Adams was indicted for fraud pertaining to two previous films and sued by investors in &quot;Valley&quot; who claimed foul, as well.

==Home media==
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the first season on DVD in Region 1 on May 16, 2006. Season 2, Volume 1 was released on January 30, 2007.

On January 8, 2014, Timeless Media Group announced it had acquired the rights to the series. They have subsequently released seasons 2 &amp; 3 on DVD. The fourth and final season was released on October 28, 2014.

<doc id="660049" wikidata="Q1216258" url="?curid=660049" title="The Bionic Woman">
<text>The Bionic Woman is an American science fiction action-adventure television series created by Kenneth Johnson based on the 1972 novel &quot;Cyborg&quot; by Martin Caidin and starring Lindsay Wagner, that aired from January 14, 1976, to May 13, 1978. A spin-off from the 1970s &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; television science fiction action series, &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; is centered around the fictional Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. 

Wagner starred as professional tennis player Jaime Sommers, who becomes critically injured during a skydiving accident. Jaime&#x27;s life is saved by Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson) and Dr. Rudy Wells (Alan Oppenheimer, Martin E. Brooks) with bionic surgical implants similar to those of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; Steve Austin (Lee Majors). Through the use of cybernetic implants, known as bionics, Jaime is fitted with an amplified bionic right ear which allows her to hear at low volumes and at various frequencies and over uncommonly long distances. She also has extraordinary strength in her bionic right arm and in both legs that enables her to jump great distances and run at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour. She is then assigned to secret missions as an occasional agent of the Office of Scientific Intelligence, while teaching middle and high school students in her regular life.

The series proved highly popular worldwide, gaining solid ratings in the US and particularly so in the UK (where it became the only science fiction program to achieve the No.1 position in the ratings during the 20th century). The series ran for three seasons, from 1976 to 1978, first on the ABC network and then the NBC network for its final season. Years after its cancellation, three spin-off TV movies were produced between 1987 and 1994. Reruns of the show aired on Sci-Fi Channel from 1993 to 2001. A failed remake of the series was produced in 2007.

==Plot==
The character of Jaime Sommers first appears in a 1975 two-part episode of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; titled &quot;The Bionic Woman.&quot; In the first episode, Steve travels to his hometown of Ojai, California, to buy a ranch that is for sale and to visit his mother and stepfather, Helen and Jim Elgin. During his visit, he rekindles his relationship with high school sweetheart Jaime Sommers, now one of America&#x27;s top 5 tennis players.

While she is on a skydiving date, Jaime&#x27;s parachute malfunctions and she plummets to the ground, falling through tree branches, hitting the ground and suffering traumatic injuries to her head, legs, and right arm. Steve then makes an emotional plea to his boss, Oscar Goldman, to save Jaime&#x27;s life by making her bionic. When Oscar balks, Steve commits Jaime to becoming an operative of the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI). Goldman ultimately gives in and assigns Dr. Rudy Wells (played at this point in the series by Alan Oppenheimer) and the bionics team to rebuild her.

Jaime&#x27;s body is reconstructed with parts similar to Steve&#x27;s, but later Oscar jokes that hers cost less than Austin&#x27;s six million because her parts were &quot;smaller&quot; (despite the show&#x27;s German name, &quot;Die Sieben Millionen Dollar Frau&quot;, or &quot;The Seven Million Dollar Woman&quot;). Like Austin, her right arm and both her legs are bionic, but instead of a bionic eye she has a bionic ear. Jaime&#x27;s legs are capable of propelling her at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour (having been clocked at more than 62 mph in &quot;Doomsday Is Tomorrow&quot; and outpacing a race car going 100 mph in &quot;Winning is Everything&quot;) and jumping to and from great heights. Her right arm is capable of bending steel or throwing objects great distances. Her right ear gives her amplified hearing such that she can detect most sounds regardless of volume or frequency. These bionic implants cannot be distinguished from natural body parts, except on occasions where they sustain damage and the mechanisms beneath the skin become exposed, as seen in Part 2 of the episode &quot;Doomsday Is Tomorrow&quot;, when Jaime sustained damage to her right leg. Jaime discovers on vacation in the Bahamas her artificial bionic skin cannot suntan with exposure to sunlight.

After Jaime recovers from her operation, Steve tries to break his agreement with Oscar that she will serve as an agent for OSI. Jaime agrees to undertake a mission for Oscar despite Steve&#x27;s concerns. During the mission her bionics malfunction, and she experiences severe and crippling headaches. Dr. Wells determines that Jaime&#x27;s body is rejecting her bionic implants and a massive cerebral clot is causing her headaches and malfunctions. Soon after, Jaime goes berserk and forces her way out of the hospital. Steve pursues and catches her, and she collapses in his arms. Soon after, Jaime dies on the operating table when her body shuts down.

The character was so popular that ABC asked the writers to find a way to bring her back. In the first episode of the next season, it is revealed that Jaime had not died after all, but Steve was not told. He soon discovers the truth when he is hospitalized after suffering severe damage to his bionic legs; he sees Jaime before slipping into a coma.

As Steve later learns, Wells&#x27; assistant, Dr. Michael Marchetti, urged Rudy (now played by Martin E. Brooks) to try his newly developed cryogenic techniques to keep Jaime in suspended animation until the cerebral clot could be safely removed, after which she was successfully revived. A side effect of the procedure causes Jaime to develop retrograde amnesia, preventing her from recalling previous events including her relationship with Steve. Any attempt to remember causes her headaches and pain. Realizing that he is the primary trigger for her painful memories, Steve reluctantly asks Oscar to transfer Jaime to another medical facility away from him. There, she undergoes a successful surgery to restore her memory — she remembers everything except her love for Steve and the skydiving accident that led to her bionics. When they meet again, she tells Steve that they can start again with friendship and that it can be a whole new beginning for them. Steve agrees.

Jaime retires as a tennis player and takes a job as a schoolteacher at an Air Force base in Ojai, California. She lives in an apartment over a barn located on the ranch owned by Steve&#x27;s mother and stepfather, both of whom are aware of Steve and Jaime&#x27;s bionic implants and their lives as secret agents. Season three opened with the two-part episode &quot;The Bionic Dog&quot;, in which Jaime discovers Max (short for Maximillion), a German Shepherd dog that has been given a bionic jaw and legs and can run at speeds up to 90 mph. His bionics pre-date Steve&#x27;s and Jamie&#x27;s, as he was a lab animal used to test early bionic prosthetics. He was named &quot;Maximillion&quot; because his bionics cost &quot;a million&quot; dollars. When he was introduced, he experienced symptoms suggesting bionic rejection and was due to be put to sleep. Jaime discovered the condition was psychological, stemming from a traumatic lab fire that injured him when he was a puppy. With Jaime&#x27;s help, Max was cured and went to live with her, proving himself to be of considerable help in some of her adventures. The original intent was to create a spin-off series featuring &quot;the bionic dog,&quot; and at the end of the two-part episode that introduced him, it was implied Max would stay with Jaime&#x27;s forest ranger friend Roger Grette in the Sierra Mountains and Jaime would visit occasionally. However, the network rejected the proposed spin-off series and Max stayed with Jaime instead, making several appearances throughout the third season of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;.

==Production and broadcast==
To maintain the show&#x27;s plausibility, creator/executive producer Kenneth Johnson set very specific limits on Jaime Sommers&#x27; abilities. He elaborated, &quot;When you&#x27;re dealing with the area of fantasy, if you say, &#x27;Well, they&#x27;re bionic so they can do whatever they want,&#x27; then it gets out of hand, so you&#x27;ve got to have really, really tight rules. [Steve and Jaime] can jump up two stories but not three. They can jump down three stories but not four. Jaime can&#x27;t turn over a truck but she can turn over a car.&quot; These limits were occasionally incorporated into episodes, such as &quot;Kill Oscar,&quot; in which Jaime is forced to make a jump that&#x27;s too far down for her bionic legs, causing massive damage to them and nearly causing her death as a result.

The series premiered on ABC in January 1976, as a mid-season replacement for the sitcoms &quot;When Things Were Rotten&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s My Mama&quot;. With fourteen episodes airing from January 1976 to May 1976, it became the fifth-most-watched television show of the whole 1975–76 season—despite running for only half the season—ranking behind &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;, and &quot;All In The Family&quot;, and slightly ahead of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. Season two ran from September 1976 to May 1977 with 22 episodes and finished with good ratings (number 14 overall, slightly behind &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;). Season two also had its most notable episodes, &quot;Kill Oscar&quot; in which Jaime fights the fembots, and &quot;Deadly Ringer&quot;, for which Wagner won an Emmy Award. Although the show performed well during season two, ABC elected not to renew the series, feeling it was no longer attracting the kind of demographic that ABC wanted (ABC head Fred Silverman was notorious for his focus on demographics). NBC picked up the show for a third (and final) season, which ran from September 1977 to May 1978 with 22 episodes and featured a new character, Chris Williams (Christopher Stone), as a recurring love interest for Jaime. This was due in part to the change of networks, which prevented further crossovers by Jaime&#x27;s former love interest, Steve Austin; however, in a situation still considered unique, Anderson and Brooks continued to play their roles in both series, despite the network differential.

The series proved popular worldwide, particularly so in the United Kingdom, where it was shown on the ITV network and achieved unusually high audience figures for a science fiction show. The first episode of the series (&quot;Welcome Home Jaime&quot;) was shown on 1 July 1976 and was the most watched programme of the week. It was watched in 7 million homes, giving it an average of 14 million viewers. Two weeks later, the show&#x27;s third episode (&quot;Angel of Mercy&quot;) also became the most watched programme of the week. Its success continued with a further 10 episodes scoring in the top 20 during 1976. (By contrast, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; never once entered the top 10 rating during its five seasons, though this was most likely because the show was never broadcast across all ITV stations at the same time). The second season also proved popular, with seven episodes finishing in the weekly top 20, the highest of these being the episode &quot;The Vega Influence&quot; on 12 May 1977, which reached 8 with 14.8 million viewers. The third season was not broadcast simultaneously across all ITV stations in the UK, however, and therefore no episodes reached the weekly Top 20.

==Episodes==

===Storylines===
The most notable of the frequent crossovers between the two shows included a two-part episode in which Steve and Jaime square off against Austin&#x27;s sometimes-friend/sometimes-enemy Bigfoot and a three-part story arc entitled &quot;Kill Oscar&quot; that aired the first and third parts as &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; episodes and the second part as an episode of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. The close connection between &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; was highlighted by the fact that Richard Anderson and Martin E. Brooks played their same characters on two television shows (eventually) running concurrently on two networks.
On her own, Jaime&#x27;s enemies include the Fembots, a line of powerful robots that she fights twice in the series over several episodes. She also thwarts the plan of an aging nuclear scientist named Elijah Cooper to destroy all life on Earth using a doomsday device in &quot;Doomsday Is Tomorrow&quot;. Jaime&#x27;s missions frequently involved undercover work in which she takes on a secret identity, such as a nun, a police officer, a college student, an air-steward, a singer, and a professional wrestler. Her tennis background also came into play occasionally, and she was also from time to time seen having adventures with some of her students in Ojai.

As with spy shows at this time, Jaime was frequently kidnapped (more often than not with the use of chloroform or a drugged drink) and placed in dangerous situations from which she would need her bionic abilities to escape. Typically, she would be bound or handcuffed to a bomb from which she could escape with ease once she woke up. However, on one occasion she was handcuffed to a friend, so she could not use her bionic strength to escape as this would pull off the friend&#x27;s hand.

Jaime dealt with a number of bizarre cases, such as a villain who operates a hair salon using a &quot;truth serum&quot; shampoo to extract information from OSI agents. In another episode, a convict named Lisa Galloway (also portrayed by Lindsay Wagner) is given plastic surgery and tries to replace Jaime. In a later episode, Lisa ingests a paste-like substance called Adrenalizine that gives her temporary super-strength, allowing her to fully replace Jaime at OSI while the real Jaime is imprisoned and led to question her own identity. Lisa, however, did not know of Jaime&#x27;s bionic implants and believed her powers to have come from the Adrenalizine. After Jaime&#x27;s eventual escape, Dr. Wells discovers that the Adrenalizine was breaking down and becoming toxic to Lisa&#x27;s health. Further complicating the issue was Lisa&#x27;s increasing belief that she was in fact, the real Jaime.

During the series, it is shown that Jaime&#x27;s enhanced abilities have their limitations. In one of the &quot;Kill Oscar&quot; chapters, Jaime jumps from the window of a particularly tall building while trying to escape the Fembots. However, due to the height from which she jumped, her legs explode upon landing, nearly killing her. Extreme cold is shown to inhibit her bionic implants, causing them to freeze up and malfunction (a scenario also common with Steve Austin). However, her right ear, as it is encased in her body, is typically not subject to these negative effects.

While Steve Austin occasionally (particularly in early episodes) employed violence in order to complete missions, Jaime&#x27;s approach tended to be less-violent and as such she was rarely shown directly using her bionic strength against a human opponent (and even when she did, never with deadly force).

===Final episode===
In the last episode (&quot;On the Run&quot;), Jaime is called &quot;Robot Lady&quot; by a little girl who has learned about her bionics. Like Steve Austin in the original book &quot;Cyborg&quot;, she has to come to terms with the fact that she is not quite human. After three years with too many assignments to allow her time to herself, she resigns. However, the people in charge decide that she cannot just be allowed to leave and want to put her into a safe community where they can keep their eye on her. She goes on the run but later realises that she is still the same woman, despite her mechanical parts and goes back to work for the OSI, but with fewer missions and more time to herself. The final episode was inspired by &quot;The Prisoner&quot; as Jaime is similarly being pursued by entities concerned about the secret information she possesses.

Despite being on different networks, both &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; were simultaneously cancelled in the spring of 1978 due to poor ratings; after 2 1/2 and 5 seasons respectively. Unlike &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, which ended with a standard episode, &quot;On the Run&quot; was written and filmed as a resolution to the series.

Three made-for-TV movies were produced that expanded the &quot;bionic family&quot; and explored a rekindled love between Jaime and Steve.

In the first reunion, &quot;The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman&quot; (1987), Jaime and Steve are reunited after nearly ten years of living separate lives. Jaime&#x27;s memory is fully restored (according to Oscar, Jaime was involved in an explosion at the American Embassy in Budapest and &quot;she remembered everything&quot; after she recovered from her concussion) and she tries to reconcile her feelings for Steve while at the same time helping train Steve&#x27;s son Michael in the use of his own recently acquired updated bionics. Jaime challenges Michael to a friendly race. He overtakes her and she makes the comment that she feels like an &quot;obsolete model&quot;. Michael is kidnapped by Fortress. Steve and Jaime along with the Air Force infiltrate the abandoned glass factory to &quot;rescue&quot; Michael.

The second film, &quot;Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman&quot; (1989), introduced Sandra Bullock as paraplegic Kate Mason who becomes a next-generation bionic woman and Sommers again helps train the cyborg.

In the final reunion film, &quot;Bionic Ever After?&quot; (1994), a computer virus corrupts Jaime&#x27;s bionic systems. Dr. Wells informs Steve that &quot;she may never be bionic again,&quot; but Steve&#x27;s main regard is he wants her alive above all else. She undergoes a major upgrade, which not only increases the power of her bionics but gives her night vision. Finally, after many years, the bionic couple get married.

==Music==
Jerry Fielding was the regular composer for the series and wrote its opening and closing themes. His friend Joe Harnell took over regular music duties midway through season one and wrote new opening and closing themes for season two. When Fielding expressed disappointment at this, the show instituted a policy where they used Fielding&#x27;s opening theme and Harnell&#x27;s closing theme. Harnell&#x27;s compositions for the program were post-released from 2002-2010 in the compact disc format. In 1978, Columbia released a 45 rpm record with Japanese singers performing (in Japanese) &quot;Jaime&#x27;s Love&quot; and &quot;At The Time of Kindness&quot;.

==Home media==
In the UK, Universal released three single-disc volumes of selected episodes of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; in 2001/02. Each volume contained three episodes. Universal then released the first two full seasons of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; on DVD in the UK and Australia in 2005/06. There were no special features on any of the sets. Season three was eventually released in the UK by Fabulous Films in December 2012, along with repackaged versions of the first two seasons and a complete 18-disc boxed set of all three seasons. These versions contained various special features as found on the Region 1 sets (see below), though the season three release also contains all three of the Bionic reunion movies from the 1980s and 1990s.

In Germany, Koch Media has released all three seasons on DVD under the name &quot;Die Sieben Millionen Dollar Frau&quot; (&quot;The Seven Million Dollar Woman&quot;), though these sets do not contain special features.

Plans for a North American DVD release were first announced in 2004 by Universal Home Video. Those plans were made public via a listing in a TV-DVD release guide sent to retailers, a mention in an otherwise unrelated studio press release, and as a trailer included on a DVD given away through retail chain Best Buy. However, that release never happened due to rights issues which prevented both &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; from being released on DVD in North America at that time.

In April 2010, creator Kenneth Johnson said that the rights issues had been solved and he was taping interviews for the DVD. On July 15, 2010, Universal Studios announced the release of the first season on DVD in North America, which took place on October 19, 2010. Season Two was released on May 17, 2011. On October 4, 2011, Universal released &quot;The Bionic Woman: The Complete Third &amp; Final Season&quot; on Region 1 DVD.

On October 13, 2015, Universal released &quot;The Bionic Woman- The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

The Shout! Factory will release the Blu-ray version of the complete series on August 30, 2022.

==In other media==
Two novels adapting various episodes were published to coincide with the series: &quot;Welcome Home, Jaime&quot; and &quot;Extracurricular Activities&quot;, both by Eileen Lottman. The UK editions of these two books were credited to &quot;Maud Willis&quot; and were retitled &quot;Double Identity&quot; and &quot;A Question of Life&quot;, respectively. Although the closing credits of every episode says the series was based upon Martin Caidin&#x27;s 1972 novel, &quot;Cyborg&quot;, this only refers to the bionics concept, the characters of Rudy Wells and Oscar Goldman, and the occasional appearance by Steve Austin; Jaime Sommers does not appear in any of Caidin&#x27;s novels.

Charlton Comics published a comic book adaptation, beginning in late summer 1977 (October shelf date). The series would not pick up again until #2&#x27;s February 1978 shelf date, then continued until June of that year, for at total of five issues. UK comic &quot;Look-In&quot; ran a colour comic strip between 1976 and 1979, written by Angus P. Allan and drawn by artists including John Bolton and Arthur Ranson. The character was also to have appeared in a 1996 comic miniseries entitled &quot;Bionix&quot; by Maximum Press. Although the magazine was advertised in comic book trade publications, it was ultimately never published.

The French comic magazine &quot;Télé-Junior&quot; published strips based on the TV series. This included their own versions of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and the &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; which was renamed &quot;Super Jaimie&quot;. The artist behind this was Pierre Dupuis.

In March 2012, Dynamite Entertainment launched a new &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; comic book title, based upon the revised continuity established in the Kevin Smith-written &quot;The Bionic Man&quot; comic (a reimagining of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;), in which the character of Jaime Sommers was reintroduced. A crossover mini-series, &quot;The Bionic Man vs. The Bionic Woman&quot;, was launched in January 2013. Unlike the &quot;Bionic Man&quot; title, which (depending on the artist) occasionally renders Steve Austin in the likeness of actor Lee Majors, the Dynamite version of Jaime Sommers generally is not rendered in the likeness of Lindsay Wagner. In late 2013, Dynamite ended both series and in the spring of 2014 launched &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man Season 6&quot;, a more faithful adaptation of the original &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; TV series. Jaime Sommers, based on the Wagner interpretation, was reintroduced in issue 3 and in June 2014 Dynamite announced it will publish &quot;The Bionic Woman Season 4&quot;, a continuation of the TV series, beginning in the fall of 2014.

==Merchandise==

Like its parent program &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a 12-inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version (bionic modules and removable bionic limbs), except instead of a bionic eye the doll&#x27;s head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaime&#x27;s bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset.

A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers individually and with Steve Austin.

A board game based on &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; series was also created. It was sold by Parker Brothers in the US, and was a 2–4 player game suited for children between 7 and 12 years of age.

In July 2016, prior to Comic-Con International, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a story about Dynamite Entertainment. In it, best-selling author Andy Mangels was revealed to be writing a prestigious new intercompany crossover mini-series for the company, in conjunction with DC Comics: &quot;Wonder Woman &#x27;77 Meets The Bionic Woman&quot;, bringing together the Lynda Carter television character with Lindsay Wagner&#x27;s fellow 1970s television super-heroine. The series was released in December 2016. A crossover comic book series with &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; titled, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels vs. the Bionic Woman&quot; was released in July 2019.

==Television remake==
In August 2002 it was announced that the show was to be remade by producers Jennifer and Suzanne Todd (&quot;Team Todd&quot;) for the USA Network. After the initial press release was issued, the show never made it out of pre-production and no other announcements were made as to the show&#x27;s fate.

On October 9, 2006, NBC Universal announced that it was bringing the project back, with new producers and a reworking of the concept. The project&#x27;s one-hour pilot was given an official greenlight by NBC on January 3, 2007. English actress Michelle Ryan (affecting an American accent) was cast in the title role for this pilot, and Katee Sackhoff played Sarah Corvus, the bionic woman&#x27;s nemesis. The series was subsequently picked up by NBC and debuted on September 26, 2007. Eight more episodes were produced and aired before the Writers Guild of America strike forced a halt to production. Series developer and producer David Eick told the official website of the Sci-Fi Channel (now known as Syfy) on March 18, 2008, that the series had been cancelled.

The new series featured very few elements of the original script and focused on a much darker concept, but received generally negative reviews. Lindsay Wagner, the original Bionic Woman, was not involved in the new series and was very critical of this version. Wagner said, &quot;On a technical level, it was very good, but I don&#x27;t think they understood the show. It was steeped in that old-school thinking. It was like a lot of things today, angry and dark.&quot;

<doc id="660050" wikidata="Q4862115" url="?curid=660050" title="Baron Arundell of Wardour">
<text>Baron Arundell of Wardour, in the County of Wiltshire, was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1605 for Thomas Arundell, known as &quot;Thomas the Valiant&quot;, son of Sir Matthew Arundell (died 1598) and grandson of Sir Thomas Arundell (executed 1552) and of Margaret Howard, a sister Queen Katherine Howard. According to Agnes Strickland, Margaret Howard, Lady Arundel had been a Lady Attendant to Katherine Howard, her sister, during her time she was the Queen. Arundell had already been created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire by Rudolph II in December 1595 (see below). He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He fought as a Royalist in the Civil War and was mortally wounded at the Battle of Stratton in 1643. His son, the third Baron, was implicated in the Popish Plot and imprisoned in the Tower of London for six years. However, after the accession of James II he was restored to favour and served as Lord Privy Seal from 1687 to 1688. His great-great-great-grandson, the eighth Baron (the title having descended from father to son), was an avid collector of art and accumulated immense debts in building and furnishing New Wardour Castle.

He had no sons and was succeeded by his cousin, the ninth Baron. He was the son of the Hon. James Everard Arundell, younger son of the sixth Baron. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the tenth Baron. He voted against the Reform Bill 1832, the only Catholic peer to do so. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eleventh Baron. Two of the eleventh Baron&#x27;s son, the twelfth and thirteenth Barons, succeeded in the title. The latter was a Roman Catholic priest. On the thirteenth Baron&#x27;s death the title passed to his third cousin once removed, the fourteenth Baron. He was the great-grandson of Thomas Raymond Arundell, younger son of the aforementioned the Hon. James Everard Arundell, younger son of the sixth Baron. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifteenth Baron. When he died the titles passed to his son, the sixteenth Baron, who died from effects of service in 1944 during the Second World War. On his death the barony became extinct. 

John Richard Arundell, 10th Baron Talbot de Malahide (born 1931) is the son of Reginald John Arthur Talbot, who in 1945 assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Arundell, and who was the great-grandson of Admiral The Hon. Sir John Talbot and his wife Mabile Mary Arundell, daughter of Hon. Robert Arthur Arundell, fourth son of James Everard Arundell, 9th Baron Arundell of Wardour and Charlotte Stuart Parkin, youngest daughter of Dr. Henry Parkin, RN, Inspector-General of Hospitals and Fleets.

The Barons took their title from Wardour Castle in Wiltshire, which is now partially ruined.

==Counts Arundell of Wardour in the Holy Roman Empire==
In 1595, Thomas Arundell, later to become the first Baron Arundell of Wardour, was created a hereditary Count of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Rudolph II for his military service in Hungary against the Turks. This grant occasioned much controversy on his return to England over its effect on his English precedence and the legitimacy of foreign titles in England.

The Arundell family thus held titles of nobility from different countries, governed by different rules. While their English titles normally descend according to strict primogeniture, the title of Count under the law of the Holy Roman Empire (and its successor states) belonged equally to &quot;all&quot; male-line descendants of the original grantee in perpetuity; all male-line descendants of Thomas Arundell were thus sometimes styled &quot;Count&quot; (German: &quot;Graf&quot;), while female family members were styled &quot;Countess&quot; (&quot;Gräfin&quot;).

<doc id="660059" wikidata="Q5326198" url="?curid=660059" title="Earl of Ashburnham">
<text>Earl of Ashburnham (pronounced &quot;Ash-&quot;burn&quot;-am&quot;), of Ashburnham in the County of Sussex, was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain created in 1730 for John Ashburnham, 3rd Baron Ashburnham, who was also created Viscount St Asaph, in Wales.

Baron Ashburnham was created in the Peerage of England in 1689 for John Ashburnham, grandson of the John Ashburnham who helped King Charles I escape from Oxford and Hampton Court Palace. He obtained from the King, for his London seat, the Westminster Abbey Prior&#x27;s House, which had been seized by the Crown during the dissolution of the monasteries. He rebuilt it and renamed it Ashburnham House; it now stands as one of the central buildings of Westminster School, and has given the family name to one of the co-ed day houses.

The titles all became extinct in 1924, with the death of the 6th Earl. The surviving member of the family was Lady Mary Catherine Charlotte Ashburnham (1890–1953), daughter of the 5th Earl.

The family&#x27;s wealth was substantially drawn from the Welsh village of Pembrey; as late as 1873 the earls owned 7,568 acres in Wales. They also carried on the iron industry at their extensive landholdings across Sussex.

The 2nd and 3rd Earls of Ashburnham were successful courtiers. The 4th Earl bought a famous collection of Illuminated manuscripts, which was sold by the 5th Earl, mostly to the British Library, although the Ashburnham Pentateuch is in Paris. The 5th Earl sold off most of the painting collection, including one of Rembrandt&#x27;s self-portraits. He was a supporter of the Spanish Carlist claimant, Juan, Count of Montizón.

The country seat of the Earls of Ashburnham was Ashburnham Place in Sussex. It was occupied by the 6th earl&#x27;s niece, Lady Catherine Ashburnham (1890–1953), until her death in 1953, and subsequently the contents were sold in 1953 and the land in 1953–1957. The estate was inherited by the Reverend John Bickersteth (1926–1991). The house was reduced in size and turned into a Christian conference centre, which caters to both individuals and groups.

<doc id="660067" wikidata="Q5488143" url="?curid=660067" title="Kellie Maloney">
<text>Kellie Maloney (formerly Frank Maloney; born 23 January 1953) is an English boxing manager and promoter, and television personality. Maloney managed Lennox Lewis, who won the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world, between 1989 and 2001. This made Maloney the first Briton to manage a British heavyweight champion in almost a century.

In August 2014, Maloney announced that she wished to be known as Kellie, and was undertaking gender reassignment. Maloney later appeared in the fourteenth series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in August 2014. She has been described as one of the most well-known transgender people in Britain.

== Boxing promotion ==

Maloney was born in London to Irish Catholic emigrant parents, Maureen from County Wicklow and Thomas from Roscrea, County Tipperary. She was raised as one of three brothers in Peckham, south London. Maloney&#x27;s father encouraged her to pursue boxing, and Maloney took part in her first match aged 11. However, Maloney&#x27;s small stature put her at a disadvantage, leading her to work as a boxing manager instead. By the late 1970s, her experience training other boxers and organising amateur competitions had led her to a career as a professional trainer, working with promoter Frank Warren. After splitting with Warren in the 1980s, Maloney moved into management and began promoting professional fights, becoming Lennox Lewis&#x27;s manager in 1989.

While best known as the promoter who took Lewis to the top, Maloney has also guided four other fighters to World Titles and has managed a string of British, European and Commonwealth Champions. In 2009, the &#x27;Boxing Binman&#x27;, Rendall Munroe, made his fifth successive defence of his European Super Bantamweight title and later thrice fought for a world title, twice on an interim basis, drawing once and losing twice.

On 14 September 2009 Maloney suffered a heart attack while watching John McDermott lose a contentious decision to Tyson Fury; significant heart damage was discovered when Maloney was admitted to hospital with shock after finding the body of client Darren Sutherland following his suicide. It was reported that Maloney was not welcome at Sutherland&#x27;s funeral service, although reports circulated that her wife, Tracey, and mother, Maureen, attended. Some of the evidence heard in the inquest into Sutherland&#x27;s death was critical of Maloney, who Sutherland was said to be frightened of.

Maloney announced the decision to retire from boxing in October 2013.

In April 2015, Maloney announced that, following the completion of her gender reassignment, she would be returning to boxing to promote again.

== Other ventures ==
Following her gender transition, Maloney made a number of reality television appearances. In 2014 she appeared in reality TV series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, reportedly receiving the highest fee of any housemate at £400,000. She appeared in the 2019 series of Celebrity Masterchef. In June 2021, the first trailer for &quot;Knockout Blonde&quot;, a five-part documentary series about Maloney, was released.

== Politics ==
Maloney was the UKIP candidate for the 2004 London mayoral election, during which she was accused of &quot;Griffin-like racism&quot;. 

She was also criticised for comments about lesbian and gay people. These included the explanation that a failure to campaign in Camden was because there were &quot;too many gays&quot;. Maloney later told the BBC: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to campaign around gays ... I don&#x27;t think they do a lot for society ... what I have a problem with is them openly flaunting their sexuality.&quot; James Davenport, chairman of Gay Conservatives, called for Maloney&#x27;s resignation as a UKIP candidate, saying: &quot;Frank Maloney is a dangerous extremist and should resign or be sacked as UKIP&#x27;s candidate for London mayor. UKIP must back or sack their homophobic candidate.&quot;

Maloney also stood as the UKIP candidate in the Barking constituency at the 2010 general election, finishing fifth of ten candidates with 1,300 votes (2.9%), thereby losing her deposit.

In a 2014 interview with LGBTQ magazine &quot;EQView&quot;, Maloney addressed her previous statements, stating: &quot;I accept comments I made in the past were wrong. If you knew Frank Maloney, if you were there when I made those remarks – you would have seen the smirk on my face. I knew it was wrong but I was saying it in jest [...] it was a mistake.&quot;

In 2015, Maloney spoke at UKIP&#x27;s Spring Conference in Kent, receiving a standing ovation.

Maloney later left UKIP, citing party leader Nigel Farage&#x27;s stance on LGBTQ rights as the trigger for her withdrawing her support.

== Personal life ==
Maloney has been married twice, marrying her first wife, Jackie, aged 21. The couple had their first child, Emma, shortly after.

She was married for over 15 years to second wife Tracey; they have two daughters. Maloney said in her first televised interview as an open trans woman that she and Tracey are now divorced, but that she has been &quot;very supportive&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 2015, Maloney disclosed that she once attempted to strangle her then-wife Tracey before her gender transition. She was quoted as saying, “I just lost it . . . I grabbed her and had my hands around her neck.&quot; “If [my children] hadn’t come into the room . . . I dread to think what might have happened.” Maloney wrote of the incident in her book, &quot;Becoming a Woman in a Man&#x27;s World.&quot; The book was published in June 2015.

Maloney is Catholic. She is a supporter of Millwall Football Club.

=== Gender transition ===
Following threats from the press to out her, in August 2014, Maloney announced in the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; that she is now known as Kellie, and was undergoing gender reassignment. Lennox Lewis was initially shocked at the news but expressed respect for Maloney&#x27;s decision. On a radio interview she discussed her family&#x27;s reaction with her mother Maureen, who has reportedly been supportive.

Maloney had already received counselling, hormone therapy, and voice coaching. In April 2015, Maloney announced that her gender reassignment was now complete.

<text>Boston Legal is an American legal comedy drama television series created by former lawyer and Boston native David E. Kelley, produced in association with 20th Century Fox Television for ABC. The series aired from October 3, 2004, to December 8, 2008. The series stars James Spader, William Shatner and Candice Bergen. It is a direct spin-off and continuation of the TV series &quot;The Practice&quot;, with several characters from the eighth season of that series moving to &quot;Boston Legal&quot;. While never a Nielsen ratings smash hit, the show was critically acclaimed. It received 26 Primetime Emmy Awards nominations, including for Outstanding Drama Series in 2007 and 2008 and a Peabody Award in 2005.

== Plot ==
&quot;Boston Legal&quot; follows the exploits of former &quot;Practice&quot; character Alan Shore, and his passionate co-workers, at the fictional offices of Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt. The high-end litigation firm, based in Boston, handles both civil and criminal law cases.

The series plays on the chemistry between smarmy Shore and loose cannon Denny Crane. Middle-aged Shore is wry and wily, while mid-70s Crane (suffering from early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) is flamboyant and eccentric. Shore often uses questionable methods to win cases. Crane is obsessed with the reputation of his name, which he frequently repeats. Though political opposites, Shore and Crane are best friends. Episodes more often than not end with the two relaxing and musing together on the firm&#x27;s balcony (while smoking cigars and drinking scotch whisky).

== Production ==
Prior to the show&#x27;s premiere, it had a working title of &quot;Fleet Street&quot;, an allusion to the real street in Boston where the fictitious Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt had its offices. The working title was later modified to &quot;The Practice: Fleet Street&quot;, but this title was dropped in favor of &quot;Boston Legal&quot;. The real building shown as the law office is located at 500 Boylston Street, 1.4 miles away from Fleet Street.

The American producers of the series also hired the British writer and barrister John Mortimer (creator of the UK legal series &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;) as a consultant for &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.

The show&#x27;s pilot was originally produced with former &quot;The Practice&quot; stars James Spader and Rhona Mitra, guest stars William Shatner and Lake Bell. It featured an expanded storyline with Larry Miller as Edwin Poole, Mark Valley as Brad Chase and John Michael Higgins as senior partner Jerry Austin. Monica Potter was later cast as junior partner Lori Colson and René Auberjonois as senior partner Paul Lewiston, replacing John Michael Higgins. The pilot premiered on ABC on October 3, 2004.

On November 30, 2004, it was announced that Candice Bergen would join the cast as senior partner Shirley Schmidt, a character the producers had planned to introduce for several months. Lake Bell left the series mid-season, and René Auberjonois was promoted to main cast member. Anthony Heald and Betty White also made regular guest appearances, having both appeared as the same characters on &quot;The Practice&quot;.

On April 5, 2005, the series was renewed for a second season, although ABC put the show on hiatus in favor of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; The success of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; placed &quot;Boston Legal&quot; on hold until autumn 2005, when it returned for an extended season of 27 episodes. Both Rhona Mitra and Monica Potter left the series during the hiatus, while Julie Bowen was cast as Denise Bauer. Ryan Michelle Bathe and Justin Mentell were later cast as junior associates Sara Holt and Garrett Wells. The second episode of season 3 introduced Craig Bierko as Jeffrey Coho and Constance Zimmer as Claire Simms. In episode 11, guest star Gary Anthony Williams joined the cast, with Craig Bierko leaving in episode 15.

On June 4, 2007, &quot;TV Guide&quot; announced that René Auberjonois, Julie Bowen, Mark Valley and Constance Zimmer would not return for season 4. On June 13, 2007, it was announced that actor John Larroquette (former &quot;The Practice&quot; guest star) would join the cast as a senior partner transferred from the New York offices of Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt, with actress Tara Summers joining as a young associate. Christian Clemenson (former &quot;The Practice&quot; guest star), who had guest-starred occasionally as Jerry Espenson (a brilliant but socially inept lawyer), was promoted to main cast. Production also stated that René Auberjonois, Mark Valley, Julie Bowen, and Constance Zimmer may return in guest roles. On July 2, 2007, it was reported that both René Auberjonois and Mark Valley would return in recurring roles; It was also announced that Taraji P. Henson would join the cast in season 4, with Saffron Burrows appearing in a recurring role. Burrows later became a full-time cast member.

On May 13, 2008, ABC announced that &quot;Boston Legal&quot; would return for a fifth and final season in the fall. Saffron Burrows did not return as a series regular, having joined the cast of &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot;. The final season consisted of 13 episodes to reach the &quot;100&quot; episode mark, which facilitated successful syndication. There was speculation that &quot;Boston Legal&quot; might receive an additional episode order, if the show had another strong showing in the Emmy Awards and produced solid ratings in its new fall time slot. The season began airing on September 22, 2008.

On June 18 and June 20, 2008, it was reported that Gary Anthony Williams and Taraji P. Henson would not return for season 5 as Clarence Bell and Whitney Rome, respectively. On July 17, 2008, &quot;Boston Legal&quot; was nominated for a series-high seven Emmy nominations, including for Best Drama Series for the second consecutive year. Spader, Bergen and Shatner were each nominated for their respective roles.

&quot;Boston Legal&quot;&#x27;s two-hour-long series finale aired on Monday, December 8, 2008 at 9:00PM Eastern/8:00PM Central. David E. Kelley stated in an interview with the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; on December 7, 2008 that it was ABC&#x27;s decision to end &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, and that he &quot;had to fight to bring it back for a short season of 13 episodes&quot;.

The show was noted for frequently breaking the fourth wall throughout its run.

The program included such events as an adaptation of &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;, starring Jason Robards (from the 1962 novel by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn); &quot;The Seven Little Foys&quot;, starring Mickey Rooney, Eddie Foy Jr. and the Osmond Brothers; &quot;Think Pretty&quot;, a musical starring Fred Astaire and Barrie Chase; and Groucho Marx in &quot;Time for Elizabeth&quot;, a televised adaptation of a play that Marx and Norman Krasna wrote in 1948.

Generally, each episode ran for an hour, although for some &#x27;special presentations&#x27;, NBC expanded the broadcast time to 90 minutes.

Hope was paid US$25,000 ($ in dollars ) per week for those episodes he merely introduced, and US$500,000 ($ in dollars ) for those in which he starred. Hope&#x27;s performances consisted of his typical joke- and celebrity-filled blackout sketches. These were usually called &quot;Chrysler Presents a Bob Hope Special&quot;. Every season, Hope traveled to Vietnam for Christmas, to entertain the troops.

Actors who appeared in episodes included Phyllis Avery, John Cassavetes, Broderick Crawford, Angie Dickinson, Peter Falk, Sean Garrison, Sam Levene, Jack Lord, Carol Lynley, Ida Lupino, George Maharis, Darren McGavin, Dina Merrill, Hugh O&#x27;Brian, Suzanne Pleshette, Cliff Robertson, William Shatner, Robert Stack, Robert Wagner, Stuart Whitman, Shelley Winters, and Robert Young.

Notable directors included Sydney Pollack, Stuart Rosenberg, John Cassavetes, Sam Peckinpah, Ida Lupino, and Daniel Petrie.

Several episodes were rerun from 1968 through 1972 under several different titles: &quot;NBC Adventure Theatre&quot; (1971–1972), &quot;NBC Action Playhouse&quot; (1971–1972), &quot;NBC Comedy Playhouse&quot; (1968–1970) and &quot;NBC Comedy Theater&quot; (1971–1972). The Hope introductions were replaced by other hosts, such as Peter Marshall (who hosted &quot;Action&quot;), Art Fleming (&quot;Adventure&quot; in 1971), Ed McMahon (&quot;Adventure&quot; in 1972), Monty Hall (&quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; in 1968) and Jack Kelly (&quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; in 1970, and &quot;Comedy Theater&quot;).

In syndication, the series was presented as Universal Star Time and Theatre of the Stars, minus Hope&#x27;s opening and closing segments.

Several of the dramatic episodes of the series aired in Britain on BBC2 as Impact, which also included episodes of &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;.

<text>Baron Astley of Reading, in the County of Berkshire, was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1644 for the Royalist soldier Sir Jacob Astley. He was a descendant of Ralph Astley (13th century), brother of Andrew de Astley, ancestor of the Barons Astley. The title became extinct on the death of Lord Astley of Reading&#x27;s grandson, the third Baron, in 1688.

The first Baron was the uncle of Sir Isaac Astley, 1st Baronet, and the great-uncle of Sir Jacob Astley, 1st Baronet.

<doc id="660075" wikidata="Q533360" url="?curid=660075" title="Softswitch">
<text>A softswitch (&quot;software switch&quot;) is a call-switching node in a telecommunications network, based not on the specialized switching hardware of the traditional telephone exchange, but implemented in software running on a general-purpose computing platform. Like its traditional counterparts it connects telephone calls between subscribers or other switching systems across a telecommunication network. Often a softswitch is implemented to switch calls using voice over IP (VoIP) technologies, but hybrid systems exist.

Although the term &quot;softswitch&quot; technically refers to any such device, it is conventionally applied to a device that handles IP-to-IP phone calls, while the phrase &quot;access server&quot; or &quot;media gateway&quot; is used to refer to devices that either originate or terminate traditional land line phone calls. In practice, such devices can often do both. An access server might take a mobile call or a call originating from a traditional telephone line, convert it to IP traffic, then send it over an IP network to another such device, which terminates the call by reversing the process and converting the voice over IP call to circuit-switched digital systems using traditional digital time-division multiplexing (TDM) or analog POTS protocols.

The call agents are the software switching elements of the softswitch. Other components handle functions for billing, directory services, network signaling. The network elements that convert voice streams between VoIP links and traditional media technologies, such as analog telephone lines, pair-gain devices, carrier systems, are called media gateways. A call agent may control many different media gateways in geographically dispersed areas via an IP network.

The softswitch generally resides in a building owned by a telephone company, called a telephone exchange or central office, or in a data center. Such locations have high capacity connections to carry telephone calls or digital communication to other switching centers.

Access devices to the services of a softswitch range from large media gateways with high port density to integrated access devices (IAD) at office locations, to small analog telephone adaptors (ATA) which provide just one RJ11 telephone jack to a residence. Embedded multimedia terminal adapters (eMTAs) are also built into cable television modems.

A softswitch routes telephone calls using the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) network. SS7 modules may be implemented directly in the softswitch, or accessed from standalone signaling servers.

At the turn of the 21st century with IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), the softswitch element is represented by the media gateway controller (MGC) element, while the term &quot;softswitch&quot; is rarely used in the IMS context, where it is called an &quot;access gateway control function&quot; (AGCF).

==Class 4 and Class 5 softswitches==
VoIP softswitches are subdivided into Class 4 and Class 5 systems, in analogy to the traditional functions in the public switched telephone network.

Softswitches used for transit VoIP traffic between carriers are usually called Class 4 softswitches. Analogous with other Class 4 telephone switches, the main function of the Class 4 softswitch is the routing of large volumes of long-distance VoIP calls. The most important characteristics of Class 4 softswitch are protocol support and conversion, transcoding, calls per second rate, average time of one call routing, number of concurrent calls.

Class 5 softswitches are intended to serve subscribers. Class 5 softswitches are characterized by additional services for end-users and corporate clients such as IP PBX features, call center services, calling card platform, types of authorization, QoS, Business Groups and other features similar to other Class 5 telephone switches.

<doc id="660077" wikidata="Q6678935" url="?curid=660077" title="Lord Aston of Forfar">
<text>Lord Aston of Forfar was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. The barony was created on 28 November 1627 for Sir Walter Aston, Bt, who had been previously created Baronet of Tixall Hall, Staffordshire (in the Baronetage of England) on 22 May 1611.

On the death of the 5th Lord, on 24 August 1751, the Tixall Baronetcy became extinct. The title fate of the Aston of Forfar barony is unclear, however.

Sir John Bernard Burke believed the original letters patent stated that on the failure of the 1st Lord&#x27;s line, the title should pass to his brother and his heirs. The barony is thought to have passed to a distant relative: Philip Aston, the great-great-grandson of the 1st Lord&#x27;s brother, who was styled as the 6th Lord during his lifetime. Later research, however, has shown there may have been a more senior descendant, meaning the 6th and 7th Lords were probably not entitled to the title, despite being styled as &quot;Lord Aston of Forfar&quot; during their lifetimes.

George Cokayne, however, acknowledges the assumption of the title by the 8th and 9th Lords as &quot;possibly lawful&quot;; with the 8th Lord receiving recognition by King George III.

==History==

The early Lords Aston were devoutly Roman Catholic and used their wealth and influence to make Tixall a safe haven for Catholics. They were also staunch Royalists, which meant that the Crown was usually prepared to tolerate their religious beliefs. The 2nd Lord Aston was accused of recusancy, but the charges were quickly dropped. During the Popish Plot, the 3rd Lord Aston was sent to the Tower of London, but in due course was released without standing trial.

The sister of Walter Aston, 1st Lord Aston of Forfar, was Anne, who married Ambrose Elton, Esq., of The Hazle, Ledbury, Herefordshire. Elton served as Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1618, and was a graduate of Brasenose College, Oxford, which his ancestors had founded.

===After the 5th Lord===
With the death of the 5th Lord, the main line of the family, and the Baronet title, became extinct. The fate of the barony of &quot;Aston of Forfar&quot; is unclear.

Burke states the title passed to Philip Aston, the great-great-grandson of the 1st Lord&#x27;s brother. Philip died unmarried and without issue; the title would thus pass to his younger brother Walter.
Philip and Walter&#x27;s right to use the title was, however, later disputed. Both were styled as &quot;6th and 7th Lord Aston of Forfar&quot; but, probably unbeknownst to them, there was a male descendant on a more senior line, William Aston of Beaulieu, County Louth, Ireland who outlived them, and was thus the legitimate (but at the time unrecognised) 6th Lord.

Philip, Walter, and the legitimate senior claimant, all died without male issue. The two claims for the title were then reunited in a single person: Walter Aston; Philip and Walter&#x27;s first cousin.

Walter was styled at the time as the 8th Lord, but his uncertain status caused problems in his career. Scottish Peers were entitled to vote to elect 16 Scottish representative peers to the House of Lords. In 1768 Walter&#x27;s right to vote in these elections raised objections as he was not listed on the Union Roll.
Walter&#x27;s right to the title seems to have been confirmed, however, when in 1769 King George III referred to him as &quot;Walter, Lord Aston, Baron of Forfar&quot;, and granted him an annual pension of £300.

Following Walter&#x27;s death, the title passed to his only son, the clergyman Walter Aston. He attempted to get official recognition for the barony, but died before the matter was settled. His claim as 9th Lord Aston of Forfar is called &quot;possibly lawful&quot; by Cokayne; who states the title became &quot;dormant&quot; with his death.

===Modern Claimants===
The title is currently considered extinct. It is, however, still claimed by descendants of the Aston family. The current claimant&#x27;s right to use the title is disputed and unrecognised.

<doc id="660084" wikidata="Q4862123" url="?curid=660084" title="Baron Athenry">
<text>Baron Athenry is one of the oldest titles in the Peerage of Ireland, but the date of its creation is thoroughly uncertain; each of the first four Berminghams listed below is claimed by some writers to have been Lord Athenry, but the evidence is disputed. The title appears to have been given to the de Birmingham family of Birmingham, Warks, England as a reward for their help in the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1172. Both Sir William de Birmingham, and his son Robert de Birmingham, are variously claimed to have been involved in the invasion, but it is probable that, after the invasion, William returned to his home in England and left Robert their new lands in Ireland.

Peter Bermingham was fined for not attending Parliament in 1284, and is enrolled as Lord Athenry in the Parliament of 1295. The title Earl of Louth was created in 1319 as a reward to John de Bermingham for his victory over Edward de Bruce in the Battle of Faughart in 1318.

The last Baron was created Earl of Louth in the Peerage of Ireland in 1749, but died in 1799. Since he had three daughters, the Earldom of Louth became extinct at his death; the Barony of Athenry became dormant. Part of the problem has been whether the Barony properly can descend through the female line, in which case it is in abeyance between the heirs of his daughters; or whether it passes through the male line. A descendant of the younger brother of the Richard, Lord Athenry, who died in 1645, claimed the Barony as heir male in 1827, and Thomas Denman, the Attorney General for England and Wales, agreed that he was heir male, but he was not recognized by the House of Lords. A claim by Thomas Sewell, son of the Earl of Louth&#x27;s eldest daughter Elizabeth, failed on the ground that the title did not pass in the female line.

<doc id="660086" wikidata="Q834155" url="?curid=660086" title="Trespass (album)">
<text>Trespass is the second studio album by the English rock band Genesis. It was released on 23 October 1970 by Charisma Records, and is their last album with original guitarist Anthony Phillips and their only album with drummer John Mayhew.

Genesis turned professional in autumn 1969, and began to rehearse intensely and play live shows. After several months of touring they secured a recording contract with Charisma Records, and entered Trident Studios in London in July 1970 to record &quot;Trespass&quot;. The music marked a departure from more pop-oriented songs, as displayed on their first album &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;, towards folk-flavoured progressive rock. This ranged from light acoustic pieces with multiple twelve-string guitars such as &quot;Dusk&quot;, to the heavier live favorite &quot;The Knife&quot;. The sleeve, featuring a knife slash across the front, was designed by Paul Whitehead. It was the first of three covers designed by Whitehead for the band. 

Shortly after recording, Phillips decided to leave the group, which almost caused Genesis to split. After discussing the situation, they agreed to continue, and replaced Mayhew with drummer and singer Phil Collins before they resumed touring. &quot;Trespass&quot; was not a major success upon release; it failed to chart in the UK and the US and it received some mixed reviews from critics, but it was commercially successful in Belgium, which helped sustain the band&#x27;s career. A reissue briefly charted the UK top 100 in 1984.

== Background and recording ==
In August 1969, Genesis decided to become a professional band. The founders – guitarist Anthony Phillips, bassist Mike Rutherford, vocalist and flautist Peter Gabriel, and keyboardist Tony Banks – had been joined by drummer John Silver. They split from producer Jonathan King and decided to write more complex material than the straightforward pop on their first album &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;. Gabriel recalled that the group wanted to explore and mix musical styles. The group bought new equipment, including a bass guitar and a Hammond organ, and recorded songs at Regent Studios for a demo, including &quot;White Mountain&quot; and &quot;Family&quot; (which became &quot;Dusk&quot;). Silver then left to study in the US.

In November, Genesis played their first live shows as a professional band, touring the local university circuit, with new drummer John Mayhew. Mayhew, the oldest and most experienced musician, came from a different background to the rest of the band. Phillips recalled that, despite their efforts to make him feel comfortable, the drummer was unsure of his playing. Also in November, Genesis friend and ex-schoolmate Richard MacPhail arranged for them to take up residence in his family&#x27;s abandoned weekend retreat house in Wotton, Surrey, called Christmas Cottage. Genesis remained there for six months, a period of intense songwriting in between concerts which would produce the bulk of the material for &quot;Trespass&quot;.

The group wanted to branch out from their earlier pop-oriented style, and write and perform songs that were unlike any other band at the time. Banks was also transitioning his main instrument from piano to Hammond organ, which was a difficult process for him. Rutherford later said that gigging was &quot;tough, but a good way of getting the music into shape&quot;. Two songs that made it to the next album, &quot;Looking for Someone&quot; and &quot;Stagnation&quot;, were recorded for a BBC session in February 1970. That same month, growing interest from audiences drew the attention of talent scouts and led to Threshold Records inviting Genesis to record &quot;Looking For Someone&quot; at De Lane Lea Studios. However, their chance for a recording contract with Threshold went up in smoke when Banks started arguing with producer Mike Pinder, saying they needed to do another take because he had played a wrong note on his organ.

In March 1970, they secured a six-week residency at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s jazz club in Soho, London, during which they were spotted by Charisma Records producer John Anthony. He persuaded label boss Tony Stratton Smith to sign them. In July 1970, they retreated to Trident Studios in London to record a new album. Anthony joined them as their producer and engineer, and the songs were recorded on 16-track tape. Phillips remembered that recording was &quot;slightly more sophisticated&quot; than on &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;, with the 16-track capability allowing them to multitrack solos, &quot;which would have been unheard of on the previous album&quot;. Rutherford and Phillips thought Anthony disliked having someone &quot;drop in&quot; individual parts, remembering by way of example that while recording &quot;Stagnation&quot;, Rutherford had to listen to several minutes of the track before putting down a guitar part, by which time he had become too nervous and played it incorrectly. The group had written an abundance of material, but with very little studio time in the budget there was no real opportunity to consider which songs should go on the album, and they had to simply record the songs which they had played the most in rehearsals and concerts. They worked well with Anthony, and later recalled that his contributions were important and helped shape the album.

==Songs==
Rutherford said that &quot;Trespass&quot; was the only Genesis album where each track was contributed to by each band member equally; every other album contained songs that were written by one or two individuals, with only minor contributions from the remaining members. Phillips likewise remarked that during the months at Christmas Cottage, Genesis&#x27;s habit of writing songs in their pre-Genesis writing partnerships (Phillips-Rutherford and Banks-Gabriel) was broken and they all began collaborating on writing each work. Banks felt that the old songwriting process was still present to an extent, with most of the songs originating from one of the two pairs before being brought to the group for further development. Banks later said that &quot;we had played live quite a bit and every song on the album had been performed on stage. We had a selection of at least twice as many songs as appeared on the album, and the versions changed rapidly.&quot; Rutherford recalled that since the songs had already been composed, arranged, and refined during live performances, there was no need to work out such things in the studio the way they did for later albums.

The 1969 album &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; by King Crimson was a heavy influence on Genesis, with a copy being played endlessly during their extended stay at Christmas Cottage. The band also drew from Gabriel&#x27;s soul influences, along with classical, pop and folk music, and made regular use of Phillips and Rutherford&#x27;s twelve-string guitar playing. To break the twelve-string guitar out of its traditional role as a background instrument and allow the listener to hear its individual notes, the band ran the twelve-string guitars through an old tape recorder instead of the conventional method of putting the microphone on the sound hole, against engineer Robin Cable&#x27;s objections. Gabriel was particularly fond of the combined twelve-string guitars and thought they gave the group a more unique and innovative sound.

The album opens with &quot;Looking for Someone&quot;, beginning with Gabriel&#x27;s vocal accompanied only by an organ, later described as being &quot;idiosyncratic enough to set them apart from the herd within seconds&quot;. Gabriel came up with the song as a soul piece, and it was then extended and developed by the group into a more folk direction. The coda at the end of the song was written by the group as a whole. Paul Stump wrote in 1997 that there is &quot;the barefaced presence of a riff&quot; from &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; by the Beatles in the song.

&quot;White Mountain&quot; originated with a twelve-string guitar theme composed by Rutherford and Phillips, for which Phillips has cited Mary Hopkin&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; as a likely influence. Banks wrote the lyrics.

&quot;Visions of Angels&quot; was recorded for the previous album &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;, but left off because the band did not think it was good enough in its present form. It originated from a piano piece by Phillips at a time when his piano technique was limited, but could produce a &quot;plodding&quot; style similar to songs by the Beach Boys and the Beatles. It has a more straightforward verse/chorus structure than some of the other songs. Genesis subsequently reworked and expanded it with a new middle section which was written by the group as a whole. Phillips commented that while he was &quot;rather heartbroken&quot; when the song was rejected for &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;, in retrospect it was a blessing, since if they had included it on that album, it never would have been developed into its best possible form. He also said that Gabriel realized sometime between the recording for &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot; and Genesis going on tour for the first time that Phillips had written the lyrics as a love song to Jill Moore, Gabriel&#x27;s girlfriend (and later wife), and it is likely that Genesis changed the lyrics before recording &quot;Trespass&quot;.
The whole group worked on the music for &quot;Stagnation&quot;, and Gabriel added lyrics to it. It was one of several Genesis songs to reuse sections of their never-recorded epic &quot;The Movement&quot;. &quot;Stagnation&quot; and &quot;Dusk&quot; showed Phillips and Rutherford&#x27;s combined twelve-string sound, along with Banks taking leads on piano, organ and Mellotron. The organ lead uses a surreal descending note which Banks produced by turning the organ off and then turning it back on. Rutherford later recalled there were around ten acoustic guitars on part of &quot;Stagnation&quot;, but they cancelled each other out in the final mix. Gabriel described the track as a &quot;journey song&quot; with its lack of a more typical verse/chorus structure and the variety of mood changes it presents. Sections were removed or altered, but the introduction remained unchanged. The vocal effect on the section referencing &quot;bitter minnows amongst the weeds and slimy water&quot; was created by having Gabriel sing into a narrow tube with the intent of making it sound like he was underwater. &quot;Dusk&quot; originated with a piece written by Phillips and Rutherford, with Phillips writing most of the lyrics.

The music to the verse/chorus section of &quot;The Knife&quot; was written by Gabriel and Banks, the lyrics were written by Gabriel and Phillips, and the remaining sections were written by all four founding members of Genesis. It was originally titled &quot;The Nice&quot; as a tribute to the Nice, and the organ part on the track was styled to resemble the playing of Nice keyboardist Keith Emerson. As fans of that group, Genesis were inspired to put together a heavier rock song which Gabriel said was &quot;something more dangerous&quot; compared to their delicate acoustic numbers. He added: &quot;It was the first peak of a darker energy that we discovered&quot;. It lasted up to 19 minutes in concert, but was reduced to nine for the album. Gabriel wrote the lyrics as a parody of a protest song. The song&#x27;s spoken word interlude, in which a group of soldiers fire on a crowd of protesters, was inspired by the Kent State shootings from the previous spring.

Phillips later recalled that the songs &quot;Everywhere is Here&quot;, &quot;Grandma&quot;, &quot;Little Leaf&quot;, &quot;Going out to Get You&quot;, &quot;Shepherd&quot;, &quot;Moss&quot;, &quot;Let Us Now Make Love&quot; and &quot;Pacidy&quot; were not developed further in the studio. Banks said that &quot;Going out to Get You&quot; was too long to fit on the album as well as &quot;The Knife&quot;, and the latter song had to have a portion of it cut out to fit on the LP.

== Artwork ==
The album cover was painted by Paul Whitehead and features an engraving by Hungarian illustrator Willy Pogany. Whitehead also did the covers for the band&#x27;s next two albums. Wanting his work to represent the band&#x27;s music, Whitehead sat in on several Genesis rehearsals to get inspiration. The cover showed two people looking out of a window at mountains, which represented the pastoral themes of some of the songs. Whitehead had finished the cover and then the band added &quot;The Knife&quot; to the running order. Feeling that the cover no longer fitted the mood of the album, they asked Whitehead to re-design it; when he was reluctant to do so, the band members inspired him to slash the canvas with an actual knife.

Tony Banks has said &quot;Trespass&quot; is his favorite of the three covers Whitehead did for Genesis, feeling it eloquently captured the two different sides of Genesis.

Whitehead&#x27;s original illustrations for the three albums were stolen from the Charisma archives when it was sold to Virgin Records in 1983. Whitehead claimed that Charisma staff got wind of the imminent sale and proceeded to loot its office.

== Release ==
&quot;Trespass&quot; was first released in the UK on the Charisma label in October 1970. In the US, it was first issued on ABC&#x27;s jazz label, Impulse!. &quot;The Knife&quot; was released as single (split into two parts) in June 1971, but did not chart.

The album was reissued by the main ABC Records label in 1974; then, after MCA Records bought out ABC, it was reissued on the MCA label. It was issued on CD in 1994 as a definitive edition remaster. A SACD/DVD double disc set (including new 5.1 and Stereo mixes) was released in 2008.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Trespass&quot; sold 6,000 copies on its original release and helped the band build up a live following. The album charted at in Belgium, which led to the band&#x27;s first overseas concerts there in January 1972.

The album had a mixed reception by the music press at the time of its release. Jerry Gilbert, writing in &quot;Sounds&quot;, gave a positive review and singled out &quot;Visions of Angels&quot; and &quot;White Mountain&quot;. A review in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said the album was &quot;tasteful, subtle and refined&quot;, and named it &quot;Album of the Month&quot;, despite it being the same month as prestigious albums such as &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, and &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; printed an extremely brief but unambiguously negative review of the 1974 reissue, saying &quot;It&#x27;s spotty, poorly defined, at times innately boring, and should be avoided by all but the most rabid Genesis fans.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s later retrospective review was only slightly more forgiving, summarising that the album &quot;is more interesting for what it points toward than what it actually &quot;does&quot;&quot;. They also commented that the guitars are so low in the mix that they are almost inaudible, leaving Banks&#x27;s keyboard instruments far more prominent. They considered this troublesome because Banks having a noticeable role &quot;isn&#x27;t the Genesis that everyone came to know&quot;.

Following the band&#x27;s growth in popularity in the 1980s, &quot;Trespass&quot; reached its peak of in the UK for one week in 1984. Reflecting on the album in 2024, Phillips suggested that the record proved to be something of a blueprint for the band: &quot;It led to the other albums Genesis did, of which I think &#x27;Selling England By The Pound&#x27; is the best. No disrespect to John Mayhew, but the arrival of a really good drummer like Phil elevated the band even further&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Shortly after recording &quot;Trespass&quot;, Phillips quit the group. He had confided in Rutherford (his long-time friend) that he was thinking of leaving after a concert at Kingston Polytechnic on 9 July 1970, and announced to the whole band that he was leaving at the end of a show in Hayward&#x27;s Heath on 18 July. According to Genesis road manager and friend Richard Macphail, the reason for Phillips&#x27;s departure was the onset of acute stage fright that became so severe that Phillips began to suffer an &quot;out of body experience on stage&quot;. Phillips confirmed, &quot;My leaving was nothing to do with the music; it was just due to stage fright and my health, really.&quot; He initially feared that Genesis would not be able to continue without him, but with Banks gaining confidence with the organ and Rutherford having grown into a major songwriter, he ultimately recognized that the band no longer needed him. While Phillips later described the &quot;Trespass&quot; recording sessions as &quot;pleasant&quot; and not considerably difficult, Rutherford recalled that Phillips looked unwell during the recording sessions, and he worried that Phillips&#x27;s departure might mean the end of Genesis. After the group drove back from the last gig in Hayward&#x27;s Heath to Gabriel&#x27;s house in Chobham, they decided they would carry on.

In the liner notes to the Genesis box set &quot;Genesis Archive 1967–75&quot;, Banks claims &quot;Let Us Now Make Love&quot;, one of Phillips&#x27;s songs, was not recorded for the album because the group thought it had the potential of a single, but following the guitarist&#x27;s sudden departure following the album&#x27;s completion, it was never recorded in the studio. A live version was released on the box set, performed in February 1970.

At the same time, the group decided to replace Mayhew with a more suitable drummer. He was older than the rest of the band and considered an outsider, and lacked confidence. Though Mayhew often wrote poetry and even had some published in a literary magazine when he was 12, he never participated in Genesis&#x27;s songwriting. An urgent replacement was required to fulfil live dates to promote &quot;Trespass&quot;. Phil Collins auditioned and joined in August, and the album was released in October. The group could not find a suitable replacement for Phillips, so they resumed gigging as a four-piece. In late 1970, they appeared on the television show &quot;Disco 2&quot; to promote the album with Phillips&#x27; replacement, Mick Barnard. The group mimed with Gabriel singing live, who recalled the performance was &quot;disastrous&quot;. The group auditioned Steve Hackett as a replacement in December and he officially joined the band the following month.

<doc id="660095" wikidata="Q1521255" url="?curid=660095" title="Branded (TV series)">
<text>Branded is an American Western television series that aired on NBC from 1965 through 1966. It was sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble in its Sunday night, 8:30 p.m. Eastern time period. The series is set in the Old West, following the end of the American Civil War. The show starred Chuck Connors as Jason McCord, a United States Army cavalry captain who had been court-martialed and drummed out of the service following an unjust accusation of cowardice.

==Overview==

The opening title credits of each episode in the series feature a depiction of McCord&#x27;s cashiering with the stripping of rank shoulder patches and his Light Cavalry Saber broken in two. McCord retained the handle of his broken saber with attached pommel. He had the remaining blade sharpened into a long knife, which he used in many episodes. McCord is sent out of the fort where this ceremony occurred, and the gates are closed behind him. Although the exact date of McCord&#x27;s cashiering is never given, events and people depicted in episodes place the events of the series itself as sometime during the first administration of President Ulysses S. Grant (1869–72) and after William Seward negotiated the Alaska purchase. The name and location of the fort are also not given.

In the pilot episode, &quot;The Vindicator&quot;, McCord is confronted by a newspaper reporter (Claude Akins) who wants a follow-up story on the Bitter Creek massacre. McCord refuses to cooperate. He knows that General James Reed, McCord&#x27;s mentor, was on a peace mission to meet representatives of the Cheyenne nation at Bitter Creek. His unit of 31 men was attacked by a group of renegade Indians known as Dog Soldiers. During the attack, McCord realized that the old general had taken leave of his senses. McCord assumed command, but it was too late. McCord was wounded in the battle and left for dead, the only survivor. He remained in a coma for 10 days after the attack. McCord was later hauled before a court-martial for desertion, convicted and drummed out of the Army.

The reporter tracks down a widow of the Bitter Creek massacre (June Lockhart). Her husband was third in command and had written several letters questioning Reed&#x27;s mental state. Those letters would have been enough to grant McCord a new trial and possibly exonerate him, but McCord convinced the widow to burn the letters to protect Reed&#x27;s reputation. McCord feared that if Reed&#x27;s reputation were damaged, certain people in Washington, DC, would try to start a new war with the Apaches. McCord chose never to speak about what really happened at Bitter Creek.

He traveled throughout the Old West, continually confronted by people who refused to believe his innocence, requiring him to prove them wrong.

John M. Pickard appeared in six episodes as General Phil Sheridan. Other notable guest stars included Chris Alcaide, Russ Conway, Don Collier, Burgess Meredith, John Carradine, Pat Conway, Alex Cord, Janet De Gore, Dolores del Río, Chad Everett, I. Stanford Jolley, Martin Landau, June Lockhart, Warren Oates, Gregg Palmer, Larry Pennell, Burt Reynolds, Lee Van Cleef, Dick Clark, Bruce Dern and Michael Rennie.

==Production==
Created by Larry Cohen, the show was co-produced for most of its run by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions (which later folded ultimately into Fremantle), more widely associated with their productions of various game shows, in association with Sentinel Productions. Current distribution rights are possessed by CBS Television Distribution, the successor in interest to original distributor KingWorld, who had purchased Leo A. Gutman in 1984. Historically, stations that air &quot;Branded&quot; have paired it with another Western series, the early Aaron Spelling production &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot;; this series, which starred veteran Western actor Walter Brennan in the title role, is also distributed by CBSTD, under Gutman, the show was part of &quot;Chuck Connors&#x27; Great Western Theatre&quot;. The series was originally syndicated internationally by ABC Films, and then Firestone Film Syndication, who later go on to distribute many Goodson-Todman game shows.

Parts of the series were filmed at the Kanab movie fort and Kanab Canyon in Utah.

The series followed Chuck Connors&#x27;s series &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, but it did not have that show&#x27;s longevity, lasting only 48 episodes over two seasons. For the first season, 13 episodes were shot in black-and-white; the three-part story &quot;The Mission&quot; was shot in color. The second season of 32 episodes was made entirely in color.

Andrew J. Fenady served as the producer, later executive producer, on the series. Fenady was also the producer of &quot;The Rebel&quot;.

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (1965)=== 
All episodes in black-and-white except for the three-part episode, &quot;The Mission,&quot; which was made in color

===Season 2 (1965–66)===
All episodes in color
==Home media==
Timeless Media Group released both seasons of &quot;Branded&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in 2004–2005. Season 1 was released on August 3, 2004, and season 2 was released on February 8, 2005. On February 16, 2010, Timeless Media Group released &quot;Branded: The Complete Series,&quot; a six-disc box set featuring all 48 episodes of the series and several bonus features. More-recent prints cut for syndication are used for the set, and as a result, three minutes are missing from each episode. &quot;Broken Saber&quot; (the film re-editing of &quot;The Mission Parts One, Two, And Three&quot;) is not included.

==Merchandise==
A tie-in board game called &quot;Branded Game&quot; was released by Milton Bradley in 1966.

== Impact on popular culture ==
&quot;Branded&quot; is referenced in the Coen Brothers 1998 film, &quot;The Big Lebowksi&quot;. The Dude (Jeff Bridges) and Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) have tracked down a teenager named Larry Sellers to his home, believing the boy stole money from a ransom package they were to deliver. Walter has learned that Sellers&#x27;s father is Arthur Digby Sellers, who must live in an iron lung, and that the older Sellers wrote 156 episodes of &quot;Branded&quot;. Upon entering the house and seeing the older Sellers in an iron lung, Walter acts with uncharacteristic humility and respect, in large part because of the reverence in which he holds &quot;Branded&quot;; before exploding into misdirected violence against a stranger&#x27;s car after an obscene interrogation of Larry fails to elicit any response from the affectless boy. Arthur Digby Sellers is a fictional character, and there were less than 50 episodes of &quot;Branded&quot;, not 156.

Major League Baseball player Ron Perranoski appeared in a 1965 episode of &quot;Branded&quot;, while he was a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Series star Chuck Connors had played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1949.

<text>Baron Athlumney, of Somerville and Dollarstown in the County of Meath, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1863 for the Liberal politician Sir William Meredyth Somerville, 5th Baronet, who had previously served as Chief Secretary for Ireland. In 1866 he was also created Baron Meredyth, of Dollardstown in the County of Meath, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest and only surviving son from his second marriage, the second Baron. He was childless and on his death in 1929 the baronies became extinct while the baronetcy became dormant.

The Baronetcy, of Somerville in the County of Meath, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1748 for James Somerville, who had earlier served as Lord Mayor of Dublin. His great-grandson, the fourth Baronet (the title having descended from father to son), represented County Meath in both the Irish and British Parliaments. He married Mary Anne, daughter of Sir Richard Gorges-Meredyth, 1st and last Baronet. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned fifth Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1863.

<doc id="660105" wikidata="Q834410" url="?curid=660105" title="Nursery Cryme">
<text>Nursery Cryme is the third studio album by the English rock band Genesis, released on 12 November 1971 on Charisma Records. It was their first to feature drummer/vocalist Phil Collins and guitarist Steve Hackett. The album received a mixed response from critics and was not initially a commercial success; it did not enter the UK chart until 1974, when it reached its peak at No. 39. However, the album was successful in continental Europe, particularly Italy.

Following the recruitment of Collins and Hackett, the band extensively toured in support of their previous album &quot;Trespass&quot; (1970), and then began writing and rehearsing for a follow-up in Luxford House, East Sussex, with recording following at Trident Studios. &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; saw the band take a more aggressive direction on some songs, with substantially improved drumming and new guitar techniques, such as tapping and sweep picking. The opening piece, &quot;The Musical Box&quot; had the band&#x27;s trademark mix of twelve-string guitars with harsh electric guitars and keyboards. The song, a macabre fairy story set in Victorian Britain, became the inspiration for the album cover, and went on to be a live favourite. Collins brought a new dimension to the group, covering the majority of the backing vocals (including his first lead vocal with Genesis on &quot;For Absent Friends&quot;) and bringing in a sense of humour on tracks like &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot;. Banks made more prominent use of the Mellotron on several tracks.

The band toured the UK and Europe for one year to promote the album, which raised their profile in both territories. The tour included a successful Italian leg in April 1972, where the group played to enthusiastic crowds. &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry in 2013.

==Background==

Genesis recorded their first album as a professional outfit, &quot;Trespass&quot; in July 1970, but immediately afterwards, founding member and guitarist Anthony Phillips quit owing to increased stress and unhappiness in touring. The other founders—singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks and bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford—almost split up the group, but decided to carry on and replace drummer John Mayhew with someone who was of equal stature to the others.

Phil Collins joined as the new drummer in August, also becoming an important backing vocalist, but they were unable to find a suitable replacement for Phillips. This led to the group completing the first half of their 1970–1971 tour as a four-piece with Rutherford playing rhythm guitar and bass pedals and Banks playing lead guitar lines on a Pianet through a distorted fuzz box amplifier in addition to his own keyboard parts. Banks credited this to improving his technique as it required him to play two keyboards simultaneously. The group felt that Collins was the best drummer they had worked with at that point, and his playing style and musical tastes gave a new dimension to their sound. Some songs were not practical to play live as a four-piece, so they looked again for a lead guitarist. In November 1970, Mick Barnard joined the group on recommendation from Friars Aylesbury&#x27;s David Stopps, and &quot;The Musical Box&quot; was added to the live set. However, the rest of the group realised that Barnard was not up to the same standard as Phillips, and they kept a look out for a better player.

Genesis recruited Steve Hackett after Gabriel spotted an advert he placed in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in December 1970, which read &quot;Imaginative guitarist/writer seeks involvement with receptive musicians, determined to drive beyond existing stagnant music forms.&quot; He saw Genesis play a concert at the Lyceum Theatre, London on 28 December, and was told by Gabriel that Barnard would have to be replaced. Barnard was dismissed from the band on 5 January 1971. Hackett quickly developed a rapport with Rutherford, sharing their love of twelve-string guitars and new musical ideas, and joined the band in early 1971.
With the addition of Hackett, Genesis continued touring, which included the &quot;Six Bob Tour&quot; with their Charisma Records labelmates Lindisfarne and Van der Graaf Generator, their first overseas shows which occurred in Belgium and the first of three appearances at the annual Reading Festival. Early attempts to work on material for their next studio album in what Hackett described as &quot;the odd day in a windy church hall&quot; while on tour were unproductive, causing the group to dedicate time. In July, they began a three-month break from touring to write and record, which was Hackett&#x27;s first experience of rehearsing with a group to a professional standard. The break was hastened by an injury Peter Gabriel sustained on June 19 during a show at Friar&#x27;s club in Aylesbury, when he attempted one of the first stage dives into an audience and ended up breaking his ankle.

The five moved to Charisma owner Tony Stratton Smith&#x27;s residence, Luxford House, a 16th-century Grade II listed building in Crowborough, East Sussex. The group nicknamed the house &quot;Toad Hall&quot;. Genesis were apprehensive about writing without Phillips, and both Collins and Hackett were unsure of what level of musical contributions they would be able to make. The group bought a Mellotron; Banks had played a rented one on &quot;Trespass&quot; and greatly liked the sound. Some material had been written when Phillips was still in the band, and was reworked. Collins was a particular workaholic and was happy to jam with anyone at any time.

==Recording==
With the new material worked out, Genesis recorded &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; at Trident Studios in London in August 1971 with John Anthony as their producer and David Hentschel their assistant engineer who, like Anthony, had worked the same role on &quot;Trespass&quot;. The album features Hackett playing a Les Paul guitar which the band had bought him along with a Hiwatt stack amplifier. Hackett recalled some difficulty in understanding what Banks and Rutherford were talking about, as the two had devised their own sayings; for instance, a passage that they had played was referred to as a &quot;nice guy&quot;.

==Songs==
===&quot;The Musical Box&quot;===
&quot;The Musical Box&quot; was a lengthy piece that described a macabre story placed in Victorian Britain. A young boy, Henry, is accidentally decapitated by his friend Cynthia while playing croquet. Returning to the house, Cynthia plays Henry&#x27;s old musical box, which unleashes the spirit of Henry as an old man. Henry has become sexually frustrated and attempts to seduce Cynthia. The nurse enters the room and hurls the musical box at the wall, destroying both it and Henry.

The song originated when Phillips was in the group, who would often write with Rutherford on 12-string acoustic guitars. The latter had begun to experiment with unorthodox guitar tunings and had the top three strings tuned to F sharp, which provided the jangly sound heard in the opening and the chord that signalled the start of the electric guitar solo. The tuning influenced the title of an acoustic piece, &quot;F&quot; (pronounced &quot;F sharp&quot;), that became the basis of &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, which was developed further after Phillips&#x27;s departure. The opening section of the song features both Rutherford and Banks on twelve-string guitar. The high-pitched sound of the opening guitar phrase was created using a varispeed technique; Rutherford&#x27;s guitar was recorded at half speed, so when played back it sounded higher than it did when it was recorded. An earlier version of the song, entitled &quot;Manipulation&quot;, was performed with Phillips in 1970 for the soundtrack of an unreleased BBC documentary on painter Michael Jackson.

The guitar solos originated from Barnard&#x27;s brief tenure in Genesis. Hackett modified sections that Phillips and Barnard had written while adding his own arrangements to the song. He realised that neither member had made a sound that resembled an actual musical box, so he took the opportunity to record a guitar lick that is heard before the lyric &quot;Here it comes again&quot;. Gabriel, a big fan of The Who at the time, pushed for Rutherford to come up with &quot;an arm waving, ballsy attacking&quot; section in a similar style to their guitarist Pete Townshend. Gabriel incorporated themes of violence and sex into the lyrics. Collins was inspired to play a rolling drum part during the middle section from hearing &quot;The Weaver&#x27;s Answer&quot; by Family, and put it to the rhythm. Banks wrote the chord sequence for the final section of the song. Despite all these additions, Genesis biographer Mario Giammetti reckoned that the original composition written by Rutherford and Phillips in September 1969 amounted to &quot;a good two thirds of this track&quot;.

The song became a live favourite during Gabriel&#x27;s tenure with the band. He first decided on the idea of wearing costumes at a gig in the National Stadium, Dublin in September 1972, leaving during the instrumental break and re-appearing at the conclusion wearing his wife&#x27;s red dress and a fox&#x27;s head. Later, he would wear an &quot;old man&quot; mask for the song&#x27;s ending, acting out the part of the aged Henry.

===Other songs===

&quot;For Absent Friends&quot; is an acoustic song, and the first Genesis song with Collins on lead vocals. The 12-string acoustic guitars were played by Rutherford and Hackett, and supplemented by a Hohner Pianet played by Banks. After coming up with the music himself and the lyrics with Collins, Hackett recalled being shy when he presented it to Gabriel as they were the new members of the group. Rather than feeling threatened, the original members were pleased that they were contributing to the songwriting, and Gabriel even approved when the other members suggested that Collins sing the lead for the song on the record. Hackett was inspired by &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; by the Beatles to write a straightforward song about a relationship, to which Collins suggested one about two old women who had lost their husbands. They wrote most of the lyrics together in the garden of Tony Stratton-Smith&#x27;s country house.

&quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; warns of the spread of the toxic plant &quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot; (also known as giant hogweed) after it was &quot;captured&quot; in Russia and brought to England by a Victorian explorer. Though the real plant is extremely toxic and dangerous, the song&#x27;s lyrics are a humorous exaggeration, suggesting the plant is attempting to take over the human race. The lyrics were written by Gabriel. The bulk of the song was written during Genesis&#x27;s time as a four-piece of Banks, Collins, Gabriel, and Rutherford, though Hackett wrote the introduction after joining the band. Both &quot;The Musical Box&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; feature Hackett&#x27;s first use of guitar tapping, a technique whereby the index finger of the plucking hand is applied directly to the guitar fret board. The opening to the latter features Hackett and Banks playing triplets in harmony.

&quot;Seven Stones&quot; was conceived by Banks, who used what Rutherford described as &quot;his big, schmaltzy, music hall chords [that] he loved.&quot; Hackett wrote the first half of the chorus, the part with wordless vocals. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reporter Chris Welch described the song as &quot;strangely mournful and inconclusive&quot;. He theorised that the old man addressed in the lyric is expressing his &quot;profound belief that the secret of success and good fortune is based purely on random events and chance&quot;.

&quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; showed a humorous side to Genesis, which was encouraged by Collins. The lyrics show black humour of a man contemplating suicide by jumping off a building. The song was written primarily by Gabriel, with Collins assisting him with the lyrics. The track was recorded with Gabriel and Collins singing the song as a duet. Their vocals were mixed onto the same audio track, so they cannot be separated.

&quot;Harlequin&quot; was written by Rutherford and Phillips. The instrumentation consists of two 12-string guitars, organ, electric guitar, a Mellotron on the vibraphone setting, and tambourine, and the vocals feature Gabriel, Collins, Rutherford, and Banks all singing harmony. Rutherford played two separate guitar parts on a single 12-string, which he thought produced &quot;pretty dodgy&quot; results, and was also critical of his lyrics. By contrast, listening to the album in 2007, Banks commented that &quot;I used to think &#x27;Harlequin&#x27; was a very weak song, but on hearing it again I realise it was pretty good.&quot;

&quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot; tells the Greek myth of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus. It originated from a short rundown passage that Banks had come up with while at university. An earlier version of the track, entitled &quot;Provocation&quot;, was recorded in 1970 for the soundtrack of an unreleased BBC documentary on painter Michael Jackson. The track makes use of the Mellotron, with an influence from King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;. Banks thought the instrument greatly complemented his piece when combined with the organ. It became the basis for &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot;, which was taken further to a complete song as the result of group jams. Hackett particularly enjoyed the time he came up with his ending guitar solo, which occurred around midnight at Luxford House during a rare moment when the group were up for recording. The lyrics were written by Banks and Gabriel.

==Cover==
The album&#x27;s sleeve was designed and illustrated by Paul Whitehead, who also designed the cover for &quot;Trespass&quot; and the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;. The cover depicts characters and scenes based on &quot;The Musical Box&quot; and Coxhill, the manor house with a croquet lawn, itself based on the Victorian home Gabriel grew up in. When the group originally saw Whitehead&#x27;s painting, they said it did not look old enough, so he varnished it with honey, which made it look like it was from the 19th century. When originally released, the cover shocked some people, because of the severed heads pictured on it.

The inner sleeve resembled an old photo album, with a panel for each song along with an illustrated picture. Whitehead later picked his design for &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; as his favourite of the three done for Genesis, noting: &quot;It just works very well with the music. It fits perfect. It&#x27;s the right colour, the right vibe.&quot;

Whitehead&#x27;s original illustrations for the three albums were stolen from the Charisma archives when it was sold to Virgin Records in 1983. Whitehead claimed that Charisma staff got wind of the imminent sale and proceeded to loot its office.

A poster of the album cover is featured in the 1995 film &quot;Empire Records&quot;, hanging behind the cash register inside the record store.

==Release==
&quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; was released on 12 November 1971. Charisma promoted the album less than &quot;Trespass&quot; since the company was busy with Lindisfarne&#x27;s &quot;Fog on the Tyne&quot;. The group felt discouraged by the general indifference from the record company, and believed songs like &quot;The Musical Box&quot; could have been as popular as &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, released at the same time.

The album did not chart in the UK until May 1974, when it peaked at , and charted there again when reissued in 1984, reaching . Though the group still had a minor cult following at home, they started to achieve commercial and critical success in mainland Europe, with the album reaching No. 4 on the Italian charts. The album continued to sell, and reached Silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry on 22 July 2013 for sales in excess of 60,000 copies.

From November 1971 to August 1972, Genesis toured to support the album, which included further visits to Belgium, and Italy for the first time, where they played to enthusiastic crowds. During the tour, Genesis recorded &quot;Happy the Man&quot;, a non-album single, with &quot;Seven Stones&quot; from &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; on its B-side. The group played a thirty-minute set on Belgian television to promote the album, which is the earliest surviving full broadcast of the group and has been repeated numerous times. Gabriel had yet to develop his on-stage costume attire and performed the show in a more straightforward frontman role. It has been one of Genesis&#x27; most popular bootlegs.

===Critical reception===

Critical response to the album was mixed. Richard Cromelin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; summarised that its &quot;main problem lies not in Genesis&#x27; concepts, which are, if nothing else, outrageously imaginative and lovably eccentric, nor with their musical structures—long, involved, multi-movemented frameworks on which they hang their narratives—nor even with their playing, which does get pretty lethargic at points. It&#x27;s the godawful production, a murky, distant stew that at best bubbles quietly when what is desperately needed are the explosions of drums and guitars, the screaming of the organ, the abrasive rasp of vocal cords.&quot; He nonetheless remarked positively on some of the songs, and noted that he saw promise in the band. In a full-page advert published in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, keyboardist Keith Emerson wrote a positive summary: &quot;This is not the start for Genesis neither is it the end. No bullshit: Their new album really is incredible&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in a review compiled for &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). Writing in sarcastic exclamations, he said of the record: &quot;God&#x27;s wounds! It&#x27;s a &#x27;rock&#x27; version of the myth of Hermaphroditus! In quotes cos the organist and the (mime-influenced) vocalist have the drummer a little confused! Or maybe it&#x27;s just the invocation to Old King Cole!&quot;

Retrospective appraisals have been mildly positive. BBC Music praised the two new members of the band as fundamental to Genesis&#x27;s artistic success, remarking &quot;Collins&#x27; snappy drums were augmented by his uncanny ability to sound not unlike Gabriel ... Hackett&#x27;s armoury of tapping and swell techniques really broadened the palette of the band, giving Tony Banks more room for his Delius-lite organ filigrees, not to mention their newly purchased Mellotron&quot;, and gushed that &quot;Genesis had virtually invented their own genre, Edwardian rock&quot;. Although Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic deemed the album highly uneven, he considered &quot;The Musical Box&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; to be &quot;genuine masterpieces&quot;, and concluded that even if the rest of the album &quot;isn&#x27;t quite as compelling or quite as structured, it doesn&#x27;t quite matter because these are the songs that showed what Genesis could do, and they still stand as pinnacles of what the band could achieve&quot;. Geddy Lee of Rush included this album among his favourites in a list from an interview with &quot;The Quietus&quot;.

<doc id="660116" wikidata="Q422226" url="?curid=660116" title="Dapsone">
<text>Dapsone, also known as 4,4&#x27;-sulfonyldianiline (SDA) or diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS), is an antibiotic commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. It is a second-line medication for the treatment and prevention of pneumocystis pneumonia and for the prevention of toxoplasmosis in those who have poor immune function. Additionally, it has been used for acne, dermatitis herpetiformis, and various other skin conditions. Dapsone is available both topically and by mouth.
Severe side effects may include a decrease in blood cells, red blood cell breakdown especially in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD), or hypersensitivity. Common side effects include nausea and loss of appetite. Other side effects include liver inflammation, methemoglobinemia, and a number of types of skin rashes. While the safety of use during pregnancy is not entirely clear some physicians recommend that it be continued in those with leprosy. It is of the sulfone class.
Dapsone was first studied as an antibiotic in 1937. Its use for leprosy began in 1945. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The form, which is taken by mouth, is available as a generic drug and not very expensive.

==Medical uses==

===Infections===
Dapsone is commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. It is also used to both treat and prevent pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). It is also used for toxoplasmosis in people unable to tolerate trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole.

Dapsone by mouth was one of the first medications used to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris, and is still occasionally prescribed for the treatment of severe cases. A topical form of dapsone is also effective with potentially less side effects.

It is unclear if the combination with pyrimethamine is useful in the prevention of malaria.

===Autoimmune disease===
*Cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Dapsone is effective and safe in persons with moderate, severe, or refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
*Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Dapsone is effective and safe for adjunctive glucocorticoid-sparing treatment of persons with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and is preferred over danazol or interferon alpha in those people with antinuclear antibodies.
*Chronic spontaneous urticaria. Dapsone is effective and safe for treatment of second-line therapy for people with chronic spontaneous urticaria in those for whom antihistamines and other first-line agents have failed.
*Relapsing polychondritis. There are no clinical trials but there are many case reports that dapsone is effective at doses of 25 mg/day to 200 mg/day for treatment of relapsing polychondritis.

===Other===
Dermatitis herpetiformis in combination with a gluten-free diet.

Dapsone may be used to treat brown recluse spider bites that become necrotic.

Dapsone is the recommended treatment for erythema elevatum diutinum, as a review found that using oral dapsone alone was effective in 80% of early cases of the disease. However, dapsone can potentially cause severe side effects, meaning that sometimes steroids or other antibiotics should be used instead, although these alternative treatments are much less effective.

An August 2015 review notes that dapsone is reported to be effective against generalized granuloma annulare.

Dapsone has been used as a monomer in the design of dye adsorbent polymers.

==Contraindications and precautions==
People with porphyria, anemia, cardiac disease, lung disease, HIV infection, G6PD deficiency, and liver impairment are at higher risks of adverse effects when using dapsone.

==Adverse effects==
Hypersensitivity reactions occur in 1.4% of persons treated with dapsone, and can be fatal in medical settings with low resources. It is a form of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in which a SCARs disorder, primarily the DRESS syndrome or a DRESS syndrome-like reaction occurs.

===Blood===
Hemolysis is the most prominent side-effect, occurring in about 20 % of patients treated with dapsone, although it is dose-related. It may lead to hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. The side-effect is more common and severe in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, leading to the dapsone-containing antimalarial combination Lapdap being withdrawn from clinical use. A case of hemolysis in a neonate from dapsone in breast milk has been reported. Agranulocytosis occurs rarely when dapsone is used alone but more frequently in combination regimens for malaria prophylaxis. Abnormalities in white blood cell formation, including aplastic anemia, are rare, yet are the cause of the majority of deaths attributable to dapsone therapy.

Methemoglobinemia occurs in about 15 % of patients treated with long-term dapsone at standard doses (100 mg/day). Only special multi-wavelength oximeters (CO-oximeters) can detect methemoglobinemia directly. When there is a &quot;saturation gap&quot; between a low ordinary pulse oximeter reading and a high arterial blood gas analysis result, methemoglobinemia may be suspected.

===Liver===

Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported by the manufacturer. These toxic reactions may also occur as part of the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (a form of SCARs-see above) or dapsone syndrome (see below). Dapsone is metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system, specifically isozymes CYP2D6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19. Dapsone metabolites produced by the cytochrome P450 2C19 isozyme are associated with the methemoglobinemia side effect of the drug.

===Skin===
When used topically, dapsone can cause mild skin irritation, redness, dry skin, burning, and itching. When used together with benzoyl peroxide products, temporary yellow or orange skin discolorations can occur.

=== Dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome ===

Hypersensitivity reactions occur in some patients. This reaction may be more frequent in patients receiving multiple-drug therapy.

The reaction always involves a rash, may also include fever, jaundice, and eosinophilia, and is likely to be one manifestation of the SCARs reaction viz., the DRESS syndrome (see above). In general, these symptoms will occur within the first six weeks of therapy or not at all, and may be ameliorated by corticosteroid therapy.

===Other adverse effects===
Other adverse effects include nausea, headache, and rash (which are common), and insomnia, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Effects on the lung occur rarely and may be serious, though are generally reversible.

==Mechanism of action==
As an antibacterial, dapsone inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, via competition with para-aminobenzoate for the active site of dihydropteroate synthase, thereby inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. Though structurally distinct from dapsone, the sulfonamide group of antibacterial drugs also work in this way.

As an anti-inflammatory, dapsone inhibits the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide-mediated cytotoxic system in polymorphonucleocytes. As part of the respiratory burst that neutrophils use to kill bacteria, myeloperoxidase converts hydrogen peroxide () into hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is the most potent oxidant generated by neutrophils, and can cause significant tissue damage during inflammation. Dapsone arrests myeloperoxidase in an inactive intermediate form, reversibly inhibiting the enzyme. This prevents accumulation of hypochlorous acid, and reduces tissue damage during inflammation. Myeloperoxidase inhibition has also been suggested as a neuron-sparing mechanism for reducing inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and stroke.

Dapsone&#x27;s anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects are thought to be its mechanism of action in treating dermatitis herpetiformis.

Dapsone is an odorless white to creamy-white crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste.

==History==

===Discovery===

In the early 20th century, the German chemist Paul Ehrlich was developing theories of selective toxicity based largely on the ability of certain dyes to kill microbes. Gerhard Domagk, who would later win a Nobel Prize for his efforts, made a major breakthrough in 1932 with the discovery of the antibacterial prontosil red (sulfonamidochrysoidine). Further investigation into the involved chemicals opened the way to sulfa drug and sulfone therapy, first with the discovery of sulfanilamide, the active agent of prontosil, by Daniel Bovet and his team at Pasteur Institute (1935), then with that of dapsone independently by Ernest Fourneau in France and Gladwin Buttle in the United Kingdom.

===Proposed use in antimalarial drugs===
The spread of drug-resistant malaria in Africa has encouraged the development of new, low-cost antimalarial drugs. &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, one of the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species that causes malaria, has developed resistance both to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, two of the most common treatments for malaria. Artemisinin, another antimalarial drug, had been developed in the 1980s but was too expensive for large-scale use. This led GlaxoSmithKline to develop Lapdap, a combination drug consisting of chlorproguanil and dapsone. Lapdap was licensed in the United Kingdom starting in October 2003.

One advantage of Lapdap was that chlorproguanil and dapsone are both low-cost drugs. Another was that by virtue of being a combination drug, it was less likely to cause drug resistance. However, because dapsone causes hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, and because G6PD deficiency affects 10-25% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, it was discovered that Lapdap is not safe for use in Africa. It was available in many African countries for four years before GlaxoSmithKline took it off the market in February 2008.

===Dapsone gel===
Dapsone had been reported in a few cases to effectively treat acne, but the risk of hemolytic anemia kept it from being widely used for this purpose. For many years scientists attempted to develop a topical formulation of dapsone that would be as effective against acne as oral dapsone, but without the hemolysis side effect. This was difficult to accomplish because dapsone is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents. In the early 2000s QLT USA developed Aczone, a 5% dapsone gel that was shown to be effective against acne without causing clinically significant declines in hemoglobin levels, even in subjects with G6PD deficiency. In February 2016, the FDA approved a 7.5% dapsone gel. This higher strength has the advantage of a once-daily application, versus twice-daily application of the 5% formulation.

==Other uses==
4,4-Diaminodiphenyl sulfone also finds uses as a curing agent for materials like epoxy resins and imine-based vitrimers, applications include in printed circuit boards, adhesives and coatings. Its use in epoxy systems typically give a resin with a high glass-transition temperature.

<text>Broken Arrow is a Western television series that ran on ABC-TV in prime time from September 25, 1956, through September 18, 1960. The show was based on the 1947 novel &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, by Elliott Arnold, which had been made into a film in 1950, starring James Stewart as Tom Jeffords and Jeff Chandler playing as Cochise.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; was set in the 1870s. The main characters were Tom Jeffords, an Indian agent, and Cochise, an Apache Chief.

The program differed from other Westerns because Jeffords and Cochise were equal in stature and respected each other. They practiced tolerance of each other.

==Cast==
*Tom Jeffords - John Lupton
*Cochise - Michael Ansara
*Duffield - Tom Fadden
*Nukaya - Steven Ritch
*Geronimo - Charles Horvath

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1956–57)===
===Season 2 (1957–58)===
==Production==
The series was based on the novel &quot;Blood Brother&quot; by Elliott Arnold. Series co-star John Lupton noted that the production tried to stay as true to the book as possible. 

Mel Epstein was the producer; directors included Alvin Ganzer, and writers included Clark E. Reynolds. The show was filmed at 20th Century Fox Studios. The sponsor was General Electric&#x27;s Appliance and Television Receiver Division. 

The pilot included some stock footage that was used in the &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; film, and Lupton wore the costume that Stewart wore in the film. Use of the costume continued in the series.

Lupton noted that at one point episodes began concentrating on Jeffords, but the original format was restored after the audience began to diminish.

Location shooting took place at Fox Ranch in Malibu Canyon and Vaquez Rocks.

== Broadcast ==
The pilot for &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; was broadcast on May 2, 1956, as an episode of &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;. Lupton portrayed Jeffords, with Ricardo Montalban as Cochise and Anthony Caruso as Geronimo. 

&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; initially was on Tuesdays from 9 to 9:30 p.m. Eastern time. From April 1960 through the end of its run it was on Sundays from 7 to 7:30 p.m. E. T Reruns were shown on Sunday afternoons during the 1959-60 TV season. Its competition included &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; on CBS and &quot;Dotto&quot; on NBC.

&quot;Cochise&quot; was the name used for the series in syndication.

==Critical response==
Donald Kirkley wrote in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, &quot;&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; is hitting the bulls-eye and setting a good example.&quot; Kirkley noted that &quot;some soft-pedalling&quot; occurred in adapting content from the book to the TV show, but he concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s a good story, and if it helps to give some viewers a new perspective on the Indian&#x27;s version of our history, it will be doing an excellent service.&quot;

A review in the trade publication &quot;Broadcasting&quot; noted &quot;obvious handicaps (and a too obvious plot)&quot; and called &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; &quot;a passable show&quot;. It said that Lupton&#x27;s &quot;appearance does not convey the rugged impression the job demands.&quot;

<text>Foxtrot is the fourth studio album by the English progressive rock band Genesis, released on 15 September 1972 by Charisma Records. It features their longest recorded song, the 23-minute track &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;.

The album was recorded during the tour in support of their previous album, &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; (1971), which saw them gain popularity, including a well-received slot at the Great Western Festival, Lincolnshire, in May 1972. The album was written over the summer of 1972 and combined songs that had already been performed live with new material worked out in jam sessions. Recording began in August with Bob Potter as producer, but sessions were prone to tension and disagreements. After a short Italian tour, sessions resumed with Dave Hitchcock as producer. The cover was the final one designed by Paul Whitehead, featuring a fox wearing a red dress. Frontman, Peter Gabriel, wore the dress and a fox&#x27;s head on stage during the following tour, which gathered press attention and raised the group&#x27;s profile.

&quot;Foxtrot&quot; was the first Genesis album to chart in the UK, reaching , and received largely positive reviews. It reached No. 15 in Italy, where the band had been popular for some time. The album has continued to attract critical praise and was reissued with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix as part of their 2008 &quot;Genesis 1970–1975&quot; box set.

== Background ==
By the end of January 1971, Genesis consisted of frontman and singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist and guitarist Mike Rutherford, guitarist Steve Hackett and drummer Phil Collins. They had played around 400 gigs in the UK, but had yet to achieve commercial success. However, they had become popular abroad. Their 1970 album &quot;Trespass&quot; had reached in Belgium, while 1971&#x27;s &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; had reached in Italy. The Italian leg of the tour in April saw Genesis play to large and enthusiastic crowds, which gave the band a new sense of their audience appeal.

In May, Genesis performed a set at the Great Western Festival in Lincoln. Gabriel appeared wearing a jewelled Egyptian collar, black eye makeup, and had shaved the front of his head, which drew attention from the press, while the fact that the set included the first public performance of &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; went unnoticed. The music press&#x27;s fixation on the non-musical elements of Genesis&#x27;s shows would be an ongoing trend. Genesis continued to tour England extensively throughout June and July, as well as playing their first shows in Holland, while simultaneously dedicating time to write and rehearse new material for a new studio album. Hackett considered leaving the band after feeling &quot;fairly shattered&quot; by the lengthy tour, but his bandmates persuaded him to stay.

== Production ==

=== Recording ===
Initial rehearsals were held in a rehearsal space at Blackheath in London before they relocated to a space underneath the Una Billings School of Dance in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. Some material Hackett used for his first solo album, &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;, was rehearsed by Genesis during the &quot;Foxtrot&quot; sessions but not used on the album. Material that became &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; and &quot;Can-Utility and the Coastliners&quot; was performed live before recording of &quot;Foxtrot&quot; started.

Genesis recorded &quot;Foxtrot&quot; in August 1972 at Island Studios in London. The recording sessions were sporadic, taking place during the brief intervals between tour dates. Genesis were set to record with producer John Anthony, who had worked with them on their previous two albums and on their new single &quot;Happy the Man&quot; in March, but escalating costs due to the slow progress of completing it caused disagreement between Anthony and Charisma Records, the group&#x27;s label, so they looked for a new producer. Banks recalled that Charisma was anxious for the group to make a hit recording. Contrarily, Hackett&#x27;s recollection was that Charisma&#x27;s owner, Tony Stratton Smith, approved their making the rise to fame slowly and was willing to allow them &quot;many, many albums to make it.&quot; Charisma&#x27;s first choice for producer was Bob Potter, a young engineer who was still learning the particulars of music production but had assisted producer Bob Johnston on the recent hit album &quot;Fog on the Tyne&quot; by Charisma labelmates Lindisfarne.

The band did not get on with Potter because he disliked their music, comparing Banks&#x27;s Mellotron opening to &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; to the soundtrack to the science fiction film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, and felt that the song was better without it. Potter was also aggravated about how long the band took to set up to record. The unproductive sessions were curtailed, and the band toured in Italy from 15 to 23 August 1972, before resuming work on the album at the end of the month. Potter ultimately went uncredited on the album, though Hackett has said that a substantial part of &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; and the entirety of &quot;Horizons&quot; were completed with Potter as producer. The group tried promoting the engineer at the sessions, Tony Platt, to producer, but that was abandoned owing to personality clashes. Smith then asked Dave Hitchcock to produce the album, in part because he had experience with recording epic suites like &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, specifically, the track &quot;Nine Feet Underground&quot; from &quot;In the Land of Grey and Pink&quot; by Caravan. Hitchcock was unfamiliar with Platt and preferred to have an engineer who he had worked well with in the past, so he replaced Platt with John Burns. Genesis approved of the change in engineers, with Banks later commenting: &quot;We weren&#x27;t too sure about [Platt] either.&quot; Burns continued to work with Genesis on their next three albums. Banks disliked Hitchcock&#x27;s production work.

During the album&#x27;s sessions, Genesis recorded the live favourite &quot;Twilight Alehouse&quot;, which had been written and performed when founding member and guitarist Anthony Phillips was in the band (a short instrumental excerpt of the song appears on their debut album &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot; between &quot;Fireside Song&quot; and &quot;The Serpent&quot;). However, Genesis decided &quot;Twilight Alehouse&quot; was inferior to the newer material and kept it off the final track list, though Banks said in 2012 that, in retrospect, it was better than most of the songs which ended up on the album. It was put out as a limited single by &quot;ZigZag&quot; magazine and the band&#x27;s fan club in 1973 and as the B-side to &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; in 1974. A piece devised by Rutherford and rehearsed by the band in a 3/4 time signature was not used, but it was adapted by Hackett into &quot;Shadow of the Hierophant&quot; on &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;. The group tried an early take of &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; but it failed to inspire their interest. Banks worked on it over the course of the following year and it was released on their next album, &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;. When Smith heard the album for the first time, he said to the band&#x27;s friend and roadie Richard Macphail: &quot;This is the one that makes their career&quot;. Smith added: &quot;I had to wipe a tear from my eye. Everything that one had believed about the band had come through&quot;. Banks was particularly pleased with &quot;Foxtrot&quot; which he thought contained no weak tracks.

=== Songs ===
====Side one====
&quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; takes its title from a line of the 1817 sonnet &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot; by John Keats. The song begins with a solo played on a Mellotron that the band had bought from King Crimson. Banks was &quot;searching for chords that actually sounded good ... because of its tuning problems&quot; and settled on the opening two chords &quot;that sounded great ... There was an atmosphere about them&quot;. The tremendous power the chords had when played at the Palazzo dello sport, Pesaro and Palasaport, Reggio Emilia during soundchecks on 11 and 12 April 1972, during their first Italian tour, convinced Genesis that they should be used in a song. The lyrics were written by Rutherford and Banks in Naples on 19 April, inspired by the view from the roof of their hotel, the Domitiana, overlooking the Mostra d&#x27;Oltremare. They wondered what an empty Earth would look like if surveyed by an alien visitor. Banks described them as &quot;a sort of sci-fi fantasy&quot; inspired by the novel &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; (1953) by Arthur C. Clarke, and the Watcher race of extraterrestrials featured in the Marvel Comics. Rutherford thought they were &quot;interesting words but they didn&#x27;t sing very well&quot;, and Banks concurred that &quot;some of the vocal parts are a bit embarrassing.&quot; The verse/chorus sections of the song were initiated by Collins, who wrote a staccato rhythm in 6/4 that he wanted to sound like Morse code. Collins felt the need to bring in &quot;some tricky arrangements&quot; into the song&#x27;s rhythm from seeing Yes perform live. Gabriel wrote some of the melodies in the verses and chorus, and Hackett came up with the idea of having a section where the 6/4 rhythm plays without accompaniment, first very softly and then very loudly.

&quot;Time Table&quot; features a romantic theme that yearns for tradition, decency, and an age of kings and queens that is banished by war and conflict. It is one of the few Genesis songs from this period which was not collaboratively written; Banks wrote and presented the song as a complete piece and had the band perform it. The distinctive sound of the piano lead in the chorus was created by picking the strings with a plectrum, thereby emulating the mechanism of a harpsichord. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Chris Welch described the track as light relief and a &quot;gentle but stirring pop song&quot; after the &quot;pounding excitement&quot; of &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;. Gabriel biographer Daryl Easlea considered the song the most overlooked from the Gabriel-era of the band&#x27;s history with its &quot;sweet and touching&quot; flavour and its resemblance to Genesis songs of the late 1970s.
&quot;Get &#x27;Em Out by Friday&quot; is a song described as a &quot;comic opera&quot; that Gabriel described as &quot;part social comment, part prophetic&quot;. The opening instrumental section consists of fragments from &quot;The Movement&quot;, a never-recorded epic song dating back to when Anthony Phillips was in the group. The rest of the music was written by the group collectively and recorded without any lyrics or vocal parts; though Gabriel sometimes sang during writing sessions for the song, his vocals were drowned out by the other members due to the mediocre PA of the rehearsal room, according to Collins. During recording of the instrumental tracks, Scottish musician Donovan came into the studio and remarked that the part where Gabriel and Banks harmonize on flute and Mellotron-flute respectively sounded like endless rows of houses. The resulting lyrics were partly inspired by Gabriel&#x27;s own landlord problems he was having with his apartment on Campden Hill Road, stories about notorious landlord Peter Rachman, and a television documentary he had seen about housing in the borough of Islington. Similar to &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; and &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot; from &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, the song features characters with Gabriel adopting a different vocal style for each one, but this time each character also has their own musical theme. The track features four characters: John Pebble, a business man of Styx Enterprises; Mark Hall (aka The Winkler), an employee of Styx who evicts tenants; Mrs. Barrow, a tenant of a house owned by Pebble; and Joe Ordinary, a customer in a pub. The song starts with Hall informing Mrs. Barrow that her property has been purchased and must be evicted, but she refuses to leave, leaving Pebble to raise her rent. Hall then offers Mrs. Barrow £400 to move to a new property in Harlow New Town, which she does, before Pebble raises her rent again. After an instrumental section, the date is 18 September 2012 and Genetic Control announce on a Dial-A-Program television service its decision to shorten the height of all humans to 4 ft. Joe reasons this so housing blocks will be able to accommodate twice as many people. Rutherford and Collins singled out &quot;Get &#x27;Em Out by Friday&quot; as one of the early Genesis songs that suffered from Genesis&#x27;s dense music and practice of recording tracks without any vocals to start with, which made the track busy and crowded when the vocals were added, while Gabriel instead felt the problem was that his lyrics were &quot;too wordy&quot;. Rutherford, however, considered the lyrics to be among Gabriel&#x27;s best. Steve Hackett&#x27;s brother John has claimed he wrote the guitar figure for the passage beginning &quot;After all this time&quot;.

&quot;Can-Utility and the Coastliners&quot; preceded the album writing sessions. It made its live debut on the afternoon of 9 April 1972, at San Martino Buon Albergo, under the title &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;. By the 14th of that same month, it had been renamed &quot;Bye-Bye Johnny&quot;. Hackett recounted that he wrote everything in the song up to 1:45 in and the closing vocal melody, and Rutherford wrote the guitar break and came up with the idea of the bass remaining silent from 3:44-4:00. Collins said he recalls writing part of the song but could not remember which part, though Hackett remarked that the instrumental parts of the closing (from 5:17 onward) sound like Collins&#x27;s work. The organ and Mellotron playing together was inspired by &quot;Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; by Procol Harum (one of Genesis&#x27;s major inspirations) from their album &quot;A Salty Dog&quot; (1969). The lyrics are based on King Canute and his inability to hold back the incoming tide. Hackett, who wrote the lyrics, said that he was drawn to Canute because he seemed the complete opposite of the self-aggrandizing attitude typical of world leaders. However, Welch theorised that the song may be in fact about Gabriel and the idea of a singer growing wary of his role and his flattering admirers.

====Side two====
Side two begins with &quot;Horizons&quot;, a short guitar instrumental performed by Hackett that was recorded in the short time that Potter was the album&#x27;s producer. It was written in the course of a year, and took musical inspiration from the Prelude of Suite No. 1 in G major, BWV 1007 for cello by Bach. He presented the piece to the group at a rehearsal on an electric guitar, though he had written it on a steel-string acoustic. He said that he was not sure it was right for Genesis because it was a solo piece, and initially thought the band would reject it. Hackett remembered Collins saying that there should be applause added to the end of the piece, and felt surprised when the band agreed to include it on the album. Hackett wrote it with English composers of the Tudor period in mind, including William Byrd, who often composed very short pieces, and a piece by Julian Bream. He pointed out the common mistake adopted by some listeners that &quot;Horizons&quot; was an opening to &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, but it did not bother him.

The rest of the second side contains &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, a 23-minute track formed of seven parts and the longest the band recorded. Gabriel believed the band&#x27;s growing support as a live act gave them the confidence to start writing extended pieces. The song and its theme of good versus evil was inspired by an experience Gabriel and his then-wife Jill had with Anthony at Kensington Palace, when she reportedly entered a trance state as the room&#x27;s windows suddenly blew open. Gabriel compared the ordeal to a scene from &quot;a Hammer Horror film&quot;. Initially, the song took form as an acoustic track similar to &quot;Stagnation&quot; from &quot;Trespass&quot; or &quot;The Musical Box&quot; from &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, something the band wished to avoid repeating. To develop the piece further, Gabriel pitched his idea for what became the song&#x27;s fifth section, titled &quot;Willow Farm&quot;, on the piano. Banks noted the change from the song&#x27;s more romantic introduction into &quot;Willow Farm&quot;, with its &quot;ugly chord sequence&quot;, worked as it took the song &quot;into another dimension&quot;. Genesis went to the street and picked eight children to record vocals for the song and paid them ten &#x27;bob&#x27; (shillings) each. &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot; was improvised by Banks, Rutherford and Collins, with Hackett later layering guitar parts on top of it. It is a mostly instrumental performed in a 9/8 time signature that began with Rutherford playing his bass pedals which Collins recalled as &quot;totally abstract with no time signature&quot; and incorporated a drum pattern to it. Banks assumed his organ solo would have no vocals, but after Gabriel proceeded to record lyrics over it, something that he disagreed with initially, he said, &quot;it only took about ten seconds to think &#x27;This sounds fantastic, it&#x27;s so strong. Banks picked &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot; and &quot;As Sure as Eggs Is Eggs&quot; as &quot;the best piece of composition&quot; Genesis recorded during Gabriel&#x27;s tenure as lead singer, but thought Gabriel had written the lyrics too quickly. Collins supported this view, who recalled Gabriel rushing to get them written while the backing tracks were being recorded.

=== Sleeve design === 
The album&#x27;s cover was the last of three Genesis releases designed by Paul Whitehead, following &quot;Trespass&quot; and &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;. He was a former art director for &quot;Time Out&quot; and gained inspiration from the lyrics to &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, which alludes to the apocalypse. Whitehead wanted to present the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in an original way but it turned into something &quot;a little more whimsical&quot;, with two horse riders being a monkey and an alien. The cover for &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; had depicted croquet which represented the English upper class which Whitehead repeated on &quot;Foxtrot&quot; with the depiction of fox hunting. The croquet scene is also repeated, placed in the background which has the Victorian manor now replaced with a hole in the ground. Whitehead devised the album&#x27;s title, which he had done for &quot;Trespass&quot; and &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; as he recalled the group were stuck for ideas. He had heard the word &quot;foxy&quot;, an American slang term for an attractive woman, during a visit in the United States, and &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which he used as inspiration to draw a female with a fox head. Whitehead&#x27;s original illustrations for the three albums were stolen from the Charisma archives when it was sold to Virgin Records in 1983. Whitehead claimed that Charisma staff got wind of the imminent sale and proceeded to loot its office.

The band disliked the cover. Gabriel felt less pleased with the design than Whitehead&#x27;s previous works. Hackett felt &quot;unsure&quot; about the cover when he saw it for the first time, calling it a &quot;strange&quot; design that has made more sense to him over time. Banks thought it was the weakest cover Whitehead designed for Genesis. Rutherford felt the design was a decline in quality following the &quot;lovely atmosphere&quot; of the &quot;Trespass&quot; and &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; covers, saying the &quot;Foxtrot&quot; cover was &quot;a little bit weak&quot;. Collins thought it was not &quot;particularly special&quot; and lacked a professional look.

== Release ==
&quot;Foxtrot&quot; was released in September 1972. &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; was re-recorded in a shorter version for a US single.

It became the band&#x27;s highest-charting album at the time of its release, peaking at No. 12 for a seven-week run on the UK Albums Chart. Like their previous three albums, &quot;Foxtrot&quot; failed to chart in the United States. It reached in Italy, signifying their growth in popularity in Europe after &quot;Trespass&quot; had topped the charts in Belgium. &quot;Foxtrot&quot; is certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 60,000 units.

=== Critical reception ===

Initial reception for this album was mixed. Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;C&quot;. In his review for &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine, Jerry Gilbert thought Genesis &quot;almost achieved the perfect album&quot;. At times he noticed &quot;the overall sound does lack the required vitality&quot; and moments where the band &quot;are trying just that little bit too hard&quot;, but such moments &quot;are sporadic&quot;, and considered it more interesting than &quot;Trespass&quot; and &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;. Welch thought &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was &quot;a milestone in the group&#x27;s career&quot;, &quot;an important point of development in British group music&quot;, and that the band had reached &quot;a creative peak&quot;. A short critical review from Rich Aregood in the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; read: &quot;Genesis still has trouble putting songs together, but they play and sing beautifully.&quot;

Retrospective reviews of the album have been more positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was &quot;the first time that Genesis attacked like a rock band&quot;. François Couture, on AllMusic, described &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; as the band&#x27;s &quot;undisputed masterpiece&quot;. BBC Music gave a favourable review, liking the production but feeling the lyrics had dated. &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; gave the album three stars (out of five) in its 1979 first edition, then dropped it in its 2nd edition in 1983 when the album went out of issue.

In 2015, the album was ranked in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time. XTC guitarist Dave Gregory said: &quot;To this day &quot;Foxtrot&quot; is a magical album. &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; became like an addiction. It had such a great sound, and enough mystery to make you want to hear it over and over again ... To this day, I will never tire of it&quot;. Faith No More bassist Bill Gould named it one of the ten albums that changed his life.

=== Reissues ===
&quot;Foxtrot&quot; was re-released in 1994 as a digitally remastered CD issued by Virgin. As part of the band&#x27;s box set &quot;Genesis 1970–1975&quot; released in 2008, &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was reissued as a hybrid CD/Super Audio CD with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix with a DVD of previously unreleased bonus material. The reissue includes sleeve notes written by Queen drummer Roger Taylor. Later in 2014, &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was reissued on a remastered 180 gram LP and remastered CD by Rhino Records, Atlantic Records, and Charisma Records.

=== Tour ===
Whereas Genesis&#x27;s previous tours had featured setlists that varied from show to show, the tour which followed the recording of &quot;Foxtrot&quot; had a relatively stable setlist; from September through early November it usually consisted of &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;, &quot;Can-Utility and the Coastliners&quot;, &quot;Get &#x27;Em Out by Friday&quot;, &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot;, and &quot;The Knife&quot;, with occasional performances of &quot;Twilight Alehouse&quot; and &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot;. On 10 November they performed &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; live for the first time, and to make room for its inclusion in concerts, &quot;Can-Utility and the Coastliners&quot; (a song which Genesis felt had never worked well live) was permanently dropped from the set.

On 28 September 1972, Genesis played a gig at the National Stadium, Dublin. During the last song, &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, Gabriel disappeared during the instrumental section, and re-appeared wearing his wife&#x27;s red dress and a fox&#x27;s head, mimicking &quot;Foxtrot″&quot;s front cover. He had not told his bandmates he would do this, but he appeared in this getup on the front cover of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, raising the band&#x27;s profile. The album entered the UK Albums Charts at No. 12 on 14 October 1972 due in large part from this exposure in the music press.

The tour covered Europe and North America between September 1972 and May 1973. It opened with a UK leg with Lindisfarne as co-headliners. The group played their first US shows during the tour, including a warm up show at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts followed by a gig at Philharmonic Hall in New York City with String Driven Thing in December 1972. The latter was in benefit for the United Cerebral Palsy Fund. Despite the band&#x27;s critical opinion of the concert due to a lack of rehearsal time, technical problems, and a perceived unenthusiastic audience, it went down well with the crowd that requested more Genesis songs be played on local radio stations, thus increasing their exposure.

A later UK leg, again with String Driven Thing as the support act, included two shows (Manchester on 24 February 1973 and Leicester on the 25th) which were recorded and used as the source for Genesis&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Genesis Live&quot;.

<doc id="660123" wikidata="Q7671152" url="?curid=660123" title="TPG (Internet service provider)">
<text>TPG is an Australian internet service provider that specialises in consumer and business internet services as well as mobile telephone services. TPG is the second-largest internet service provider in Australia and is the largest mobile virtual network operator. As such, it has over 671,000 ADSL2+ subscribers, 358,000 landline subscribers and 360,000 mobile subscribers, and owns the second-largest ADSL2+ network in Australia, consisting of 391 ADSL2+ DSLAMs. It also operates in New Zealand. 

The company was formed from the merger between Total Peripherals Group, which was established in 1986 by David and Vicky Teoh, and SP Telemedia in 2008. In August 2018, TPG and Vodafone Hutchison Australia announced their intention to merge, with TPG holding a 49.9% stake in the merged company. In February 2020, the Federal Court of Australia decided against an objection by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission opposing that merger. On 13 July 2020, Vodafone Hutchison Australia merged with TPG via a scheme of arrangements. TPG was renamed to TPG Corporation Limited and delisted from Australian Securities Exchange, with Vodafone Hutchison taking on the TPG Telecom name.

TPG provide five ranges of products and services including Internet access, networking, OEM services, mobile phone service and accounting software.

==History==

Total Peripherals Group was established in 1986 by Malaysian-born Australian businessman David Teoh, as an IT company that sold OEM computers and later moved to provide internet and mobile telephone services.

In 2007, TPG took a 70 per cent controlling interest in then struggling Adelaide internet provider Chariot. David Teoh shored up TPG&#x27;s role as Chariot&#x27;s parent company a year later, in April 2008, and then quickly followed up with the $225 million reverse takeover of SP Telemedia to bring Soul, Chariot and TPG under the one banner.

Soul Converged Communications, formally known as Comindico, was an Australian telecommunications company based in Sydney. Soul&#x27;s main activities revolve around telecommunications, with business and home and small business divisions. In April 2005, it bought a 43 per cent stake in mobile phone company B Digital. In September 2006 Soul increased its stake in B Digital to 75 per cent and made a full takeover offer.

In April 2008, SPT merged with Total Peripherals Group at a cost of $150 million in cash and $230 million in shares (approximately 80 million) with TPG owner David Teoh becoming the largest shareholder and Executive Chairman of the combined group. On 25 November 2009, following shareholder approval, SP Telemedia Ltd (Trading as Soul) changed its name to TPG Telecom Ltd. The ASX code was changed also from SOT to TPM.

=== Post-merger acquisitions ===
In November 2009, TPG, which already owned a substantial portion of PIPE Networks&#x27; shares, announced it intended to acquire the company. TPG completed its acquisition of PIPE for $373 million by way of scheme of arrangement on 31 March 2010, after shareholders and government bodies approved the transaction. The acquisition allows TPG to gain full control of PIPE Networks&#x27; fibre optic network in Australia and the Pipe Pacific Cable (PPC-1), connecting Sydney to Guam.

TPG, in a statement released on 14 July 2011, announced it intended to acquire IntraPower for $12.8 million. It was also stated in the statement that the Board of Directors of IntraPower recommended the shareholders of the company approve the transaction. The acquisition was completed on 30 August, allowing TPG to benefit from TrustedCloud and other IntraPower products.

On 9 December 2013, TPG purchased AAPT from Telecom New Zealand for $450 million. The transaction allows TPG to gain control of AAPT&#x27;s fibre-optic network, which extends across six Australian states and territories, and is estimated to be 11,000 km in length. The transaction was expected to be finalised by February 2014.

On 13 March 2015, TPG advised of its intent to take over Australia&#x27;s third Largest ISP iiNet at A$8.60 per share, giving a value of $1.4 billion. TPG offered $8.60 per iiNet share, on top of the entitlement to the already-declared 10.5-cent interim dividend, valuing iiNet at about 21 times its underlying net profit for 2014. The deal was approved by shareholders on 27 July, and by the ACCC on 20 August 2015. This made TPG Australia&#x27;s second-largest ISP by customer volume after Telstra.

=== Ventures ===
On 7 May 2013, TPG won a $13.5 million bid for two 10 MHz spectra of the 2.5 GHz band in Australia. TPG, which operates a mobile virtual network, in a statement, announced that the network would allow it to offer &quot;value-adding&quot; wireless broadband products to its customers. Although TPG did not reveal what the purpose of the spectra would be, the 2.5 GHz band is expected to be used as a 4G channel. The network will be switched on in October 2014.

On 17 September 2013, during TPG&#x27;s financial year results presentation, it was announced that the company plans on constructing fibre to the Building (FTTB) networks, capable of offering a bandwidth of 100 Mbit/s, in five major capital cities. It was also estimated that the cost of the plans would be $69.99 per month, lower than the current price of NBN plans though it excludes initial connection and setup costs. Although, final costs have yet to be determined, the network is expected to compete with the NBN, leading to calls from the research director of Ovum, David Kennedy, for NBN Co to respond competitively.

On 13 July 2020, Vodafone Hutchison merged with TPG via a scheme of arrangements. TPG was renamed to TPG Corporation Limited and delisted from ASX, with Vodafone Hutchison taking on the TPG Telecom name.

In September 2020, TPG Telecom announced a partnership with the National Australia Bank to deliver fixed and mobile network services for the bank.

==== SIMBA Telecom ====

On 14 December 2016, it was announced that TPG had secured the fourth telecommunications license in Singapore for S$105 million (A$122 million). They were provisionally allocated 60 MHz of spectrum made available in the New Entrant Spectrum Auction (NESA), with spectrum rights that commenced in April 2017. TPG was also expected to provide street level coverage nationwide within 18 months of the start date. TPG launch commercial service in March 2020.

For voice communications, it makes use of Voice over LTE technology which saw subscribers have initial troubles setting up during the trial rollout at the start of 2019 as existing phones did not contain the configuration profile required for the VoLTE functionality to work. These was largely resolved when the major brands added the configuration profile into their operating systems, with Apple adding the profile only in September 2019. 

On 30 June 2020, as part of the Vodafone-TPG merger, the Singapore operations were spun off into an independent entity, Tuas Limited. As part of the spin off, Tuas Limited was also listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. In December 2021, TPG won 10MHz of the 2.1GHz frequency spectrum in the government auction, allowing it to deploy its 5G network across the island. SIMBA Telecom has since been an independent company in Singapore, effectively making it a local company with zero TPG Australia&#x27;s involvement in any of its business operations. In April 2022, the Singapore operations was rebranded from TPG to SIMBA Telecom, in reference to Singapore&#x27;s &#x27;Lion City&#x27; nickname.

== Divisions ==
===TPG Internet===

TPG Internet sells many internet services, such as dialup, ADSL, ADSL2+, fibre and SHDSL broadband access, IPTV, VoIP solutions and virtual phone cards. TPG also include plans and bundles on the National Broadband Network (NBN).

====Unlimited broadband====

On 24 September 2010, TPG introduced a phone-line bundled unlimited plan that included unlimited, unmetered uploads and downloads and free IPTV.

====IPTV====

After a limited beta, TPG officially launched IPTV service on 12 June 2007. IPTV was available to all ADSL2+ customers on supported exchanges. It was discontinued in 2019.

===TPG Systems===

TPG Systems was an OEM of PCs, laptops and servers. This division of the company ceased trading in early 2004.

===TPG Software===

TPG Software, trading as Catsoft, makes and sells accounting software to businesses.

===TPG Boomerang TV===

TPG Boomerang TV was a subscription television service that operated using PAS 8. It was launched in February 2000.

===TPG Mobile===

TPG Mobile acted as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) using the Optus network from August 2008 until late 2015. In September 2015, TPG announced a switch to Vodafone Australia as its mobile service provider, moving its customers from the Optus network to the Vodafone network. Subsequently, in 2020, TPG merged with Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA), effectively becoming the owner of the Vodafone network in Australia.

TPG Telecom and Optus have implemented an 11-year regional network-sharing deal under a Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) agreement that went live in early 2025. This arrangement allows TPG to use 2,444 Optus mobile network sites across regional Australia, expanding its mobile coverage from around 400,000 square kilometers to approximately 1 million square kilometers, covering 98.4% of Australia&#x27;s population. In return, Optus gains access to TPG&#x27;s spectrum, enhancing its network capacity and accelerating its 5G rollout in regional areas. The deal, which received ACCC approval in September 2024, aims to increase competition in the telecommunications market and improve services for customers of both companies.

===AAPT===

AAPT is TPG&#x27;s wholesale arm.

== Subscribers ==
It is Australia&#x27;s second-largest internet service provider and largest mobile virtual network operator.

== ACCC lawsuit ==

A lawsuit over TPG&#x27;s advertising campaigns was filed against TPG Telecom by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in December 2010. The ACCC accused TPG of misleading its customers by advertising that its &quot;unlimited&quot; broadband package only cost $29.99 per month when the actual minimum monthly cost for the plan is $59.99. The ACCC also claimed in the lawsuit that TPG did not adequately disclose other costs associated with the setting up of the connection. In response, TPG released a statement saying that it believes all costs were adequately noted in the advertisement and that it was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the ACCC&#x27;s decision to bring the issue to court. In November 2011, the Federal Court ruled against TPG and fined the company $2 million, however the fine was reduced to $50,000 after TPG appealed to the full bench of the Federal Court. The ACCC later filed an appeal in the High Court, which was approved in August 2013.

== Email Migration ==

In 2023, TPG commenced steps to discontinue provision of email services. An option was given to customers to close their email account or migrate email accounts to an independent organisation called &#x27;The Messaging Company&#x27;.

<doc id="660129" wikidata="Q187441" url="?curid=660129" title="Bronco (TV series)">
<text>Bronco is a Western television series on ABC from 1958 through 1962. It was shown by the BBC in the United Kingdom. The program starred Ty Hardin as Bronco Layne, a former Confederate officer who wandered the Old West, meeting such well-known individuals as Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Theodore Roosevelt, Belle Starr, Cole Younger, and John Wesley Hardin.

==Overview==
&quot;Bronco&quot; premiered in the fall of 1958 when Warner Bros. executives and actor Clint Walker clashed over Walker&#x27;s contract on the series &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. Walker had walked out on his show over such stringent clauses as a requirement that he return half of all personal appearance fees to Warner Bros., and that he only record for Warner music labels. When the two sides came to an impasse, the network hired newcomer Ty Hardin to play the new character of Bronco Layne, but kept the title of &quot;Cheyenne&quot;.

When Walker came back to his series, &quot;Bronco&quot; became a spin-off of &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. &quot;Bronco&quot; at first alternated with another Western series, &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, featuring Will Hutchins. In 1960, the two began alternating with &quot;Cheyenne&quot; under the &quot;Cheyenne&quot; title. &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; was dropped in 1961, leaving only &quot;Bronco&quot; and &quot;Cheyenne&quot; to alternate. Other Warner Bros. Westerns in production around this time included &quot;Maverick&quot; with James Garner, Jack Kelly, and Roger Moore, &quot;Colt .45&quot; with Wayde Preston, and &quot;Lawman&quot; with John Russell; series characters occasionally crossed over into each other&#x27;s series.

According to the theme song, Bronco came from the Texas Panhandle, but episodes of the series are set throughout the West.

In the eighth episode, &quot;Freeze-Out&quot; (December 30, 1958), a writer calling herself Mary Brown, played by Grace Raynor, hires Bronco to escort her to a ghost town in the high country, where they encounter three men amid the isolation. As it develops, Mary is not interested so much in story ideas, but in the body of a man buried in a nearby glacier and missing gold. Some four years before the debut of his &quot;The Virginian&quot;, James Drury plays the part of John Smith, who develops a romantic interest in Mary. Edgar Stehli (1884–1973) plays the part of &quot;Pancake&quot; Riddle.

<text>Garretson Warner Gibson (May 20, 1832 – April 26, 1910) was the 14th president of Liberia from 1900 to 1904. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, his family emigrated to Liberia in 1845. After receiving an education in mission schools, he returned to Maryland to study theology. Ordained a priest, he served as rector of the Episcopalian Trinity Church in Monrovia. He also served as Chaplain of the Liberian Senate. Later, he served as President of the Trustee Board of Liberia College and at one time President of the college.

Gibson began his political life as a justice of the peace. With the election of William D. Coleman as president in 1896, Gibson was appointed secretary of the interior. He was secretary of state when Coleman resigned in 1900, and because there was no vice-president, Gibson was chosen to succeed him. He won his own term later that year and served until 1904.

Gibson died in Monrovia on April 26, 1910. He was the last Liberian president to have been born in the United States.

==Presidency (1900–1904)==

Prior to attaining the presidency, Gibson had had a long career in government including serving as Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of State.

In 1903, the British forced a concession of Liberian territory to Sierra Leone, but tension along that border remained high.

Whenever the British and French seemed intent on enlarging at Liberia&#x27;s expense the neighboring territories they already controlled, periodic appearances by U.S. warships helped discourage encroachment, even though successive American administrations rejected appeals from Monrovia for more forceful support.

<doc id="660135" wikidata="Q645948" url="?curid=660135" title="Loeb Classical Library">
<text>The Loeb Classical Library (LCL; named after James Loeb; , ) is a series of books originally published by Heinemann and since 1934 by Harvard University Press. It has bilingual editions of ancient Greek and Latin literature, with the original Greek or Latin text on the left-hand page and a fairly literal translation on the facing page.
==History==
Under the inspiration drawn from the book series specializing in publishing classical texts exclusively in the original languages, such as the Bibliotheca Teubneriana, established in 1849 or the Oxford Classical Texts book series, founded in 1894, the Loeb Classical Library was conceived and initially funded by the Jewish-German-American banker and philanthropist James Loeb (1867–1933). The first volumes were edited by Thomas Ethelbert Page, W. H. D. Rouse, and Edward Capps, and published by William Heinemann, Ltd. (London) in 1912, already in their distinctive green (for Greek text) and red (for Latin) hardcover bindings. Since then scores of new titles have been added, and the earliest translations have been revised several times. In recent years, this has included the removal of bowdlerization from earlier editions, which often reversed the gender of the subjects of romantic interest to disguise homosexual references or (in the case of early editions of Longus&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;) translated sexually explicit passages from the Ancient Greek into Latin, rather than English.

Since 1934, the library has been co-published with Harvard University. Profit from the editions continues to fund graduate student fellowships at Harvard University.

The Loebs have only a minimal critical apparatus, when compared to other publications of the text. They are intended for the amateur reader of Greek or Latin, and are so nearly ubiquitous as to be instantly recognizable.

In 1917 Virginia Woolf wrote (in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;):

Harvard University assumed complete responsibility for the series in 1989 and in recent years four or five new or re-edited volumes have been published annually.

In 2001, Harvard University Press began issuing a second series of books with a similar format. The I Tatti Renaissance Library presents key Renaissance works in Latin with a facing English translation; it is bound similarly to the Loeb Classics, but in a larger format and with blue covers. A third series, the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, was introduced in 2010 covering works in Byzantine Greek, Medieval Latin, and Old English. Volumes have the same format as the I Tatti series, but with a brown cover. The Clay Sanskrit Library, bound in teal cloth, was also modeled on the Loeb Classical Library.

As the command of Latin among generalist historians and archaeologists shrank in the course of the 20th century, professionals came increasingly to rely on these texts designed for amateurs. As Birgitta Hoffmann remarked in 2001 of Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Agricola&quot;, &quot;Unfortunately the first thing that happens in bilingual versions like the Loebs is that most of this apparatus vanishes and, if you use a translation, there is usually no way of knowing that there were problems with the text in the first place.&quot;

In 2014, the Loeb Classical Library Foundation and Harvard University Press launched the digital Loeb Classical Library, which they described as &quot;an interconnected, fully searchable, perpetually growing, virtual library of all that is important in Greek and Latin literature.&quot;

<text>Anna Lee, MBE (born Joan Boniface Winnifrith; 2 January 1913 – 14 May 2004) was a British actress, labelled by studios &quot;The British Bombshell&quot;.

==Early life==
Anna Lee was born Joan Boniface Winnifrith in Ightham (pronounced &#x27;Item&#x27;), Kent, the daughter of Bertram Thomas Winnifrith, a headmaster and Anglican rector, and his second wife, Edith Maude Digby-Roper. Her father supported his daughter in her desire to become an actress. Lee&#x27;s grandfather, Reverend Alfred Winnifrith, was Rector of Mariansleigh. During WWI, he provided for Belgian refugees and was awarded the Medaille du Roi Albert. Lee&#x27;s brother, Sir John Winnifrith, was a senior British civil servant who became permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture. She was the goddaughter of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and lifelong friend of his daughter, Dame Jean Conan Doyle.

==Career==
===Britain===
Lee trained at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art at the Royal Albert Hall, and made her debut with a bit part in &quot;His Lordship&quot; (1932), when she was 19. She played a number of minor, often uncredited, roles in films during the early 1930s. Lee began to get more prominent roles in films to satisfy the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 (17 &amp; 18 Geo. 5. c. 29), which was an act of the United Kingdom Parliament designed to stimulate the declining British film industry. She was known for her roles in films set amongst the wealthy, particularly in &quot;Chelsea Life&quot; (1933), in which she starred with Louis Hayward.

In 1934, Lee signed a contract with Gainsborough Pictures, the biggest British production company of the era. She played leading lady roles in a variety of different genres at Gainsborough, including the comedy-thriller &quot;The Camels Are Coming&quot;, the drama &quot;The Passing of the Third Floor Back&quot;, the horror film &quot;The Man Who Changed His Mind&quot; and the war film &quot;OHMS&quot;. She appeared in the 1935 Jessie Matthews musical &quot;First a Girl&quot; as the aristocratic playgirl and other woman, Princess Miranoff. In 1937, she starred in one of the studio&#x27;s large-budget productions, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;.

In 1933, Lee met the director Robert Stevenson, who became her first husband, while shooting &quot;The Camels Are Coming&quot; on location in Egypt. In 1937, she starred in his picture, &quot;Non-Stop New York&quot;, for Gaumont British. During 1938, she took time off from acting to give birth to her first child. In 1939, Lee and her husband switched to Ealing Studios run by Michael Balcon, the former head of Gainsborough. She played a 19th-century Irish music hall performer who falls in love with an aristocrat in the comedy &quot;Young Man&#x27;s Fancy&quot; (1939) and a journalist who helps heroes thwart a foreign enemy&#x27;s plot against Britain in &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (1939).

Her final film in Britain was &quot;Return to Yesterday,&quot; a film about a young repertory theatre actress who falls in love with a Hollywood star she meets while touring in a small seaside town. Lee and Stevenson emigrated to the United States, her husband having gained a contract with David O. Selznick. She remained supportive of the British war effort during World War II, and in 1943 appeared alongside other British actors in &quot;Forever and a Day&quot;, a film made to raise money for British charities.

===United States===
After her move to Hollywood, she became associated with John Ford, appearing in several of his films, including &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (1948), and &quot;Two Rode Together&quot; (1961). She co-starred with John Wayne and John Carroll in &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; (1942).

She had a lead role opposite Brian Donlevy and Walter Brennan in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Hangmen Also Die!&quot; (1943), a wartime thriller relating to the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. She worked for producer Val Lewton in the horror/thriller &quot;Bedlam&quot; (1946) and 

Lee made frequent appearances on television anthology series in the 1940s and 1950s, including &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;The Ford Theatre Hour&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. She made a guest appearance on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as Crystal Durham in &quot;The Case of the Unsuitable Uncle&quot; (1962). She guest starred on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; in the 1963 episode “Last Seen Wearing Blue Jeans” (S1E28). 

In 1958, she returned to Britain to appear in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Day (US Title: Gideon of Scotland Yard)&quot;, in which she played the detective&#x27;s wife. She had a small role as Sister Margaretta in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, one of the two nuns who thwarted the Nazis by removing car engine parts, allowing the Von Trapps to escape. Lee appeared in &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962) in a main supporting role as Mrs. Bates, a neighbour of the sisters played by Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. In 1994, Lee took the leading role in the feature film &quot;What Can I Do?&quot;, directed by Wheeler Winston Dixon.

In later years, she became known as matriarch Lila Quartermaine on &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Port Charles&quot;. Lila was a contract role until 2003, when Lee was taken off contract and dropped to recurring status by Jill Farren Phelps, a move widely protested in the soap world. According to fellow &quot;General Hospital&quot; actress Leslie Charleson, Lee had been promised a job for life by former &quot;General Hospital&quot; executive producer Wendy Riche. When interviewed in 2007, Charleson said, &quot;The woman was in her 90s. And then when the new powers-that-be took over they fired her, and it broke her heart. It was not necessary.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lee married director Robert Stevenson, in 1933 and moved to Hollywood in 1939. They had two daughters, Venetia and Caroline. Venetia Stevenson, a former actress, was married to Don Everly of the Everly Brothers and has three children, Edan, Erin, and Stacy. Lee and Stevenson divorced in March 1944, with Venetia and Caroline electing to live with their father. Lee met her second husband, George Stafford, as the pilot of the plane on her USO tour during the Second World War. They married on 8 June 1944, and had three sons, John, Stephen and Tim Stafford.

Tim Stafford is an actor under the stage name of Jeffrey Byron. Lee and Stafford divorced in 1964. Her final marriage was to novelist Robert Nathan (&quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;, &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot;), on 5 April 1970, and ended at his death in 1985. 

Lee became a naturalised US citizen under the name Joanna Boniface Stafford (#123624) on 6 April 1945; certificate issued 8 June 1945 (#6183889, Los Angeles, California).

In the 1930s, Lee occupied a house at 49 Bankside in London; she was later interviewed by writer Gillian Tindall for a book written about the address, &quot;The House by the Thames&quot;, released in 2006. Since built in 1710, the house had served as a home for coal merchants, an office, a boarding house, a hangout for derelicts, and a private residence in the 1900s. The house is listed in tour guides as a famous residence and has been variously claimed as possibly being home to Christopher Wren during the construction of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

In 1981, a car accident left her paralysed from the waist down.

Lee was a staunch Conservative and stated that her views coincided with those of Sir Winston Churchill.

==Awards and honours==
In 1982 she was awarded an MBE, after fundraising for the White Cliffs at Dover and Ightham Mote. In 1995, her star was installed on Hollywood&#x27;s Walk of Fame. On 21 May 2004, she was posthumously awarded a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award; she was scheduled for months to receive the award, but died from pneumonia at age 91 before she could receive it. Her son, Jeffrey Byron, accepted the award on her behalf. On 16 July 2004, &quot;General Hospital&quot; aired a tribute to Lee by holding a memorial service for Lila Quartermaine.

<doc id="660161" wikidata="Q150429" url="?curid=660161" title="Pentane">
<text>Pentane is an organic compound with the formula C5H12—that is, an alkane with five carbon atoms. The term may refer to any of three structural isomers, or to a mixture of them: in the IUPAC nomenclature, however, pentane means exclusively the &quot;n&quot;-pentane isomer, in which case pentanes refers to a mixture of them; the other two are called isopentane (methylbutane) and neopentane (dimethylpropane). Cyclopentane is not an isomer of pentane because it has only 10 hydrogen atoms where pentane has 12.

Pentanes are components of some fuels and are employed as specialty solvents in the laboratory. Their properties are very similar to those of butanes and hexanes.

== History ==

Normal pentane was discovered in 1862 by Carl Schorlemmer, who, while analyzing pyrolysis products of the cannel coal mined in Wigan, identified, separated by fractional distillation and studied a series of liquid hydrocarbons inert to nitric and sulfuric acids. The lightest of them, which he called hydride of amyl, had an empirical formula of C5H12, density of 0.636 at 17 °C and boiled between 39 and 40 °C. In the next year he identified the same compound in the Pennsylvanian oil. By 1872 he switched his nomenclature to the modern one.

==Isomers==

==Industrial uses==
Pentanes are some of the primary blowing agents used in the production of polystyrene foam and other foams. Usually, a mixture of n-, i-, and increasingly cyclopentane is used for this purpose.

Acid-catalyzed isomerization gives isopentane, which is used in producing high-octane fuels.

Because of their low boiling points, low cost, and relative safety, pentanes are used as a working medium in geothermal power stations and organic Rankine cycles. It is also used in some blended refrigerants.

Pentanes are solvents in many ordinary products, e.g. in some pesticides.

==Laboratory use==
Pentanes are relatively inexpensive and are the most volatile liquid alkanes at room temperature, so they are often used in the laboratory as solvents that can be conveniently and rapidly evaporated. However, because of their nonpolarity and lack of functionality, they dissolve only nonpolar and alkyl-rich compounds. Pentanes are miscible with most common nonpolar solvents such as chlorocarbons, aromatics, and ethers.

They are often used in liquid chromatography.

==Physical properties==
The boiling points of the pentane isomers range from about 9 to 36 °C. As is the case for other alkanes, the more thickly branched isomers tend to have lower boiling points.

The same tends to be true for the melting points of alkane isomers, and that of isopentane is 30 °C lower than that of &quot;n&quot;-pentane. However, the melting point of neopentane, the most heavily branched of the three, is 100 °C &quot;higher&quot; than that of isopentane. The anomalously high melting point of neopentane has been attributed to the tetrahedral molecules packing more closely in solid form; this explanation is contradicted by the fact that neopentane has a lower density than the other two isomers, and the high melting point is actually caused by neopentane&#x27;s significantly lower entropy of fusion.

The branched isomers are more stable (have lower heat of formation and heat of combustion) than n-pentane. The difference is 1.8 kcal/mol for isopentane, and 5 kcal/mol for neopentane.

Rotation about two central single C-C bonds of &quot;n&quot;-pentane produces four different conformations.

==Reactions==
Like other alkanes, pentanes are largely unreactive at standard room temperature and conditions - however, with sufficient activation energy (e.g., an open flame), they readily oxidize to form carbon dioxide and water:
:C5H12 + 8 O2 → 5 CO2 + 6 H2O + heat/energy

Like other alkanes, pentanes undergo free radical chlorination:
:C5H12 + Cl2 → C5H11Cl + HCl
Without zeolite catalysts, such reactions are unselective, so with &quot;n&quot;-pentane, the result is a mixture of the 1-, 2-, and 3-chloropentanes, as well as more highly chlorinated derivatives. Other radical halogenations can also occur.

==Production and occurrence==
Pentane is produced by fractional distillation of petroleum and purified by rectification (successive distillations).

It occurs in alcoholic beverages and in hop oil. It is a component of exhaled breath for some individuals. A degradation product of unsaturated fatty acids, its presence is associated with some diseases and cancers.

Pentane is a relatively minor component of automobile gasoline, with its share varying within 1–6% in 1990s Sweden, 2–13% in 1990s US and 1–3% in the US in 2011. At 62, its octane number (both RON and MON) is quite low.

<text>Robert Lee Sweet (born March 21, 1960) is the drummer of the Christian metal band Stryper. He and his brother Michael founded the band as Roxx or Roxx Regime. Robert became known as the &quot;Visual Time Keeper&quot; for his wild drumming and captivating drum kits. Unlike most drummers, Sweet faces in the direction of stage left or right while playing, not straight ahead, so that the audience can see him and not have their view of him obscured by his drumkit. He began using a sideways setup in 1978 as a way to enhance his showmanship and connect with the audience. Sweet also played a key role in the visual direction of the band itself as well as being a significant contributor to the group.

Sweet&#x27;s interest in drumming began in early childhood. He cites a stop at a club during a trip to Las Vegas when he was 10 years old as a defining moment. A blue sparkle Ludwig drum set caught his attention and he &quot;fell in love&quot;.

Sweet attended Pioneer High School in Whittier, California. During high school, instead of participating in a traditional school music program like marching band, he worked with the school&#x27;s music director to put together a rock band. He is a self-taught drummer, honing his craft playing along with other drummers while developing his style at the same time. After high school he went to college to study music but left after a month.

At the age of 15, in April 1975, Sweet became a Christian, an outgrowth of a lifelong belief in God.

==Post Stryper==
After Stryper broke up in 1992, Sweet played in a variety of acts and projects largely Christian-oriented. He participated in the band King James with former Stryper bassist Tim Gaines and former Whitecross guitarist Rex Carroll, and toured with them until 1996. He also participated in other projects, such as Shameless and Titanic. Sweet recorded a solo album titled &quot;Love Trash&quot; which demonstrated an eclectic side of his writing and performing capabilities. Later, Sweet performed for a number of metal bands&#x27; albums including Blissed, Final Axe, Menchen (with guitarist Bill Menchen), Seventh Power, Subdux, and Dbeality as well as guest appearing on a few tracks for Titanic and the supergroups Shameles, 7 Hours Later and Cleanbreak.

==Stryper reunion==
Sweet played a key role in the reappearance of Stryper by taking part in 2000s &quot;Stryper Expo&quot; and a reunion show in Costa Rica. The successful reception led Sweet to push for a reunion of the band which came in the form of a request by Hollywood Records for a new &quot;Best of&quot; collection. The band decided that rather than doing another compilation, they would record two new songs and go on tour in support of the new release. 2003 saw Sweet tour with a re-formed Stryper that featured the departure of bassist, Tim Gaines, who was replaced by Tracy Ferrie. In 2004, Stryper returned to the studio to begin working on its August 2005 release, &quot;Reborn&quot;, which marked the band&#x27;s first full-length recording of original material in over 15 years, since 1990&#x27;s &quot;Against the Law&quot;. The Stryper &quot;Murder by Pride&quot; album, released July 2009, marked the first Stryper album Sweet did not record drums for, this position was filled by studio musician Kenny Aronoff. He did however play in Stryper&#x27;s &quot;25th Anniversary Tour&quot; in support of the album. Sweet has appeared on every Stryper album since.

==Influence==

<text>Concordia College is a private liberal arts college in Moorhead, Minnesota. Founded by Norwegian settlers in 1891, the school is associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and is unrelated to the Concordia University System operated by the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod. Concordia is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and has a total student enrollment of 1,800. It offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Education, and Master of Science, and Master of Music Education degrees.

Since Concordia was founded, it has articulated a Christian and global curriculum. Students are required to take courses in health, communication, religion, and culture. The college maintains athletic teams in 22 sports and carries 20 music ensembles, including The Concordia Orchestra, The Concordia Band, and The Concordia Choir.

==History==
Concordia College was dedicated as a private academy on October 31, 1891, by a group of approximately one dozen Norwegian pastors and laymen who had recently settled in the Red River Valley. The school was founded on the property of the former Episcopalian Bishop Whipple School, which had closed in 1887. English professor Ingebrikt Grose of St. Olaf College was asked to preside over the academy, which at that time offered mixed-sex education in English literature, natural sciences, mathematics, piano, and organ. The school opened with three faculty and twelve students.

In 1892, Rasmus Bogstad, a Norwegian pastor, raised funds to build a male dormitory on campus grounds. His efforts led to the construction of Academy Hall. In 1893, Grose resigned and recently hired business professor Hans Aaker took his place. Aaker became mayor of Moorhead in 1900 and left two years later when that job compromised his dedication to the school. Bogstad was appointed Concordia&#x27;s next president and established its liberal tradition. Under Bogstad, Concordia constructed a new academic building, now called Old Main.

Henry O. Shurson held the presidency after Bogstad resigned in 1910 until Johan A. Aasgaard was appointed in 1911. Under Aasgaard, the nearby Park Region College and Bruflat Academy were merged with Concordia, and a new library was built in what is now called Grose Hall. In 1925, John N. Brown became president and oversaw Concordia&#x27;s accreditation by the North Central Association in 1927. Eleven years later, a female dormitory was built, named Fjelstad Hall, and in 1947, a male dormitory was built, later called Brown Hall.

Joseph &quot;Prexy Joe&quot; Knutson became president in 1951, and presided over the construction of 16 buildings and the increase in enrollment to 1592 students. Under his leadership, the Concordia Annual Fund, which continues today, was established to raise money for the college&#x27;s interests. Paul J. Dovre took the presidency in 1975 and oversaw new college programs and articulated Concordia&#x27;s Lutheran mission. In 1991, Concordia&#x27;s Speech Team placed 4th in the nation at the AFA-NIET, beating schools with twenty times their enrolment. 

In 1999, the college welcomed President Thomas W. Thomsen, who implemented the design for a new campus center; in 2004 Pamela M. Jolicoeur, who established plans for the college&#x27;s Offutt School of Business, was appointed the first female President. Construction on the Offutt School of Business was completed in late 2012, and hosted students in the fall semester of 2013. William Craft began as president in 2011 and served until June 30, 2023. In 2018, the college&#x27;s ministry became a member of Reconciling in Christ, affirming its support of LGBTQIA+ people. Today, the college is led by President Colin Irvine.

==Academics==
Concordia is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It enrolls over 1,800 students and offers 61 majors and 12 pre-professional programs. Master of Education degrees are offered, and the most popular majors are business, education, and communication.

The college upholds a curriculum that centers on a Christian and global perspective. Affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Concordia practices the liberal arts from the Lutheran theological tradition. Faculty are encouraged to retain &quot;Becoming Responsibly Engaged in the World&quot; (BREW) as a thematic focus in their instructions. The college operates by a semester calendar and first-year students are required to take courses in health, communication, religion, and culture. An honors program is offered for motivated students.

Concordia is included in the Open Doors survey of the top twenty baccalaureate institutions that send students abroad. The college offers four global education programs and offers instruction in nine languages. Moreover, students are permitted to study at two neighboring universities, Minnesota State University Moorhead and North Dakota State University, for course credit to their degrees.

In July 2023, Concordia opened the Heimarck Center, an experiential learning facility for the Sanford Heimarck School of Health Professions.

== Student life ==
=== Music ===
The college maintains three choirs, four bands, two orchestras, three jazz ensembles, two percussion ensembles, and two handbell choirs. Music education began with the college&#x27;s 1891 formation, when piano and organ lessons were taught by one instructor. The college has since expanded to include a music department of 45 faculty that offers five Bachelor of Music degrees and two Bachelor of Arts degrees.
The Concordia Choir is a 78-member mixed choir that travels internationally and has performed at major performance venues, including Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center. The choir was founded in 1919 by the college&#x27;s voice instructor and began touring in 1923 under the direction of Herman Monson. The choir grew to national prominence in the following decades when Paul J. Christiansen became the director. Christiansen remained in the position for 49 years until composer René Clausen took over in 1986. Under Clausen, The Concordia Choir has released numerous recordings and has performed with the King&#x27;s Singers. He was succeeded in 2020 by Michael Culloton.

The college has put on an annual Christmas concert since 1927 that remains a tradition of the local community. From its inception, it has featured the music department&#x27;s choirs and orchestra. In 1940, Christianson began working with painter Cyrus M. Running to incorporate murals with the concert to reflect the music&#x27;s themes. Running completed the designs until 1978, when their development was taken over by David J. Hetland, whose murals have traditionally extended . After Hetland&#x27;s 2006 death, mural designs were taken over by artist Paul Johnson. The concert is currently performed four times annually on Concordia&#x27;s campus and twice annually at Orchestra Hall. Over 450 students perform for an audience of twenty thousand, and the concert is broadcast on radio and television. The 2009 concert, &quot;Journey to Bethlehem&quot;, was recorded by Twin Cities Public Television and won a regional Emmy. It was broadcast nationally by members of the Public Broadcasting Service.

=== Athletics ===
Concordia–Moorhead athletic teams are the Cobbers. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) since the 1921–22 academic year.

Concordia–Moorhead competes in 20 intercollegiate varsity sports, in which more than 800 students participate. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, ice hockey, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

==== Origins ====
Athletics began when a baseball club was organized in 1903 and a basketball team was formed after the construction of a gymnasium in 1907. Football emerged in 1916 and Concordia joined the MIAC in 1920. Soon after, teams for tennis, golf, wrestling, softball, volleyball, track, cross country running and others were formed.

Athletics grew further when Jake Christiansen, brother of conductor Paul J. Christiansen, was appointed physical education director in 1941. He coached the football team to five conference championships over his 28-year career. In 1952, Christiansen designed a new athletic facility that promoted the college&#x27;s reputation in the region. One of Christiansen&#x27;s former students, Jim Christopherson, took over coaching in 1969 and led the team to nine conference titles and two national championships. Both coaches have been inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame.

The 1982 Concordia–Moorhead women&#x27;s basketball team defeated Mount Mercy, 73–72, to capture the Cobbers&#x27; first AIAW Division III national championship. The Cobbers defeated St. John Fisher in the 1988 NCAA Division III championship game, 65–57, to claim the Cobbers&#x27; first NCAA national title.

<text>Nathaniel Eaton (before 17 September 1609 − before 11 May 1674) was an Anglican clergyman who was the first Headmaster of Harvard, President designate, and builder of Harvard&#x27;s first College, Yard, and Library, in 1636.

Nathaniel was the uncle of Samuel Eaton, one of the seven founding members and signatories of the Harvard Corporation by charter in 1650.

==Early life and education==
The fifth or sixth son of the Reverend Richard Eaton (1565–1616), and Elizabeth [Okell]. Nathaniel was baptised in St Mary and All Saints&#x27; Church, Great Budworth, Cheshire, where his father was vicar, on 17 September 1609.

Eaton was educated at Westminster School, London. He attended Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he was a contemporary and friend of John Harvard, a student at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge.

He then attended the University of Franeker, where he studied under Rev. William Ames. Eaton later obtained a MD and PhD from the University of Padua, in Venetia.

==Career==
In 1637, Eaton emigrated to the New England Colonies on the merchant ship &quot;Hector&quot;, and arrived in Boston on 26 June 1637 along with a party that included his older brothers, Theophilus and Samuel, and John Davenport.

===Harvard College===

In the fall of 1637, Eaton was appointed the first headmaster of the then-unnamed college which would later be named Harvard College, and was awarded 500 acres of land by the General Court of Massachusetts. He erected Harvard&#x27;s first building, in 1636, called the Old College; named, fenced and planted the Harvard Yard called the College yard; established the colony&#x27;s first printing press in March 1639, and created its first semi-public library, the Harvard Library.
Around the time that Eaton started teaching at Harvard, the Antinomian Controversy had erupted in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The governor at the time, John Winthrop, was noted for his extreme stance within the Puritan community and was feared by many of the colonists. Even those who were Winthrop&#x27;s close allies, such as Rev. Thomas Hooker, who cofounded the colony of Connecticut, were repulsed by his personality. As such, many left the colony and any Antinomians who didn&#x27;t leave voluntarily were forced out, banished, or excommunicated (such as Rev. John Wheelwright who founded Exeter, New Hampshire, and his sister-in-law, Anne (Marbury) Hutchinson, who founded a new colony in what later became Rhode Island).

Eaton&#x27;s older brother, Theophilus Eaton, led the group along with John Davenport as their religious leader. They intended to start their own settlement – probably due in part to the commanding persona of John Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony at the time (1637 to 1640, and many other terms). Winthrop was termed &quot;an object of great fear in all the colonies,&quot; and caused the Rev. Thomas Hooker and others to go off and form their own colonies. Deciding that he didn&#x27;t want to be involved in the animosity, he – like Rev. Thomas Hooker before him – founded a new colony, the colony of New Haven, though Winthrop and others begged both of them to stay.

In 1639, the year after Theophilus left, Eaton was brought before a court on allegations that he had beat his assistant Nathaniel Briscoe too harshly. According to John Winthrop&#x27;s account, Briscoe had been hired by Eaton for less than three days when a dispute broke out. Eaton ordered others to hold Briscoe in place while he beat him with &quot;200 stripes&quot; using a walnut tree branch that Winthrop describes as &quot;large enough to have killed a horse&quot;. The court also heard a number of other complaints, including that he would beat students with &quot;20 to 30 lashes at a time&quot; and that his wife had supposedly served students hasty pudding with goat dung in it as a substitute for raisins. As a result, Eaton was ordered to step down from his position and pay a fine. The school was subsequently closed the next academic year. The only record of Eaton&#x27;s own supposed confession was destroyed in a suspicious fire in the office of the historian James Savage (1784–1873), and the full extent of his guilt remains in doubt. 

It is through the court case that we know that Eaton owned a slave referred to as &quot;The Moor&quot;, in what is the earliest known record of slavery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During the trial students of Harvard complained about being served the same food as &quot;The Moor&quot;. At that time, the term &quot;Moor&quot; was used as a blanket term covering all of the inhabitants of North Africa, including Black and Muslim peoples. It is possible that &quot;The Moor&quot; had arrived a year earlier on the slave ship &quot;Desire&quot;. 

Henry Dunster succeeded Eaton in 1640 as Harvard&#x27;s first president, and the first students graduated in 1642. Dunster resigned in 1654 over disagreements with the church about infant baptism. Around the same time, he was excommunicated from the congregation in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1640, Eaton moved to the Colony of Virginia, and then sent for his wife and children who left New England, except for his two year old son Benoni.

===Family lost at sea===
According to Winthrop&#x27;s &quot;History of New England&quot;, the ship in which the family traveled disappeared without a trace. His only remaining child, Benoni Eaton, had been left in Cambridge under the care of Thomas Chesholm and his wife, Isobel; Thomas was steward of Harvard College from 1650 to 1660. Through Benoni, Nathaniel has modern descendants.

Following the loss of his family, Eaton married the widow Anne (Graves) Cotton (1620–1684), the daughter of Captain Thomas Graves (1584–1635) of Virginia, becoming the brother-in-law of William Stone, the governor of the Province of Maryland, and family members with future Founding Fathers Thomas Stone and Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer.

Eaton served for several years as an assistant to the Anglican curate at Accomac, Virginia before returning to England, where he was appointed vicar of Bishop&#x27;s Castle, Shropshire, in 1661 and rector of Bideford, Devon, in 1668.

In 1647, Eaton was exonerated of a £100 debt that Winthrop misstated as being for £1,000 in his &quot;History of New England&quot;, and with which Eaton had supposedly absconded to Virginia in 1640. The exoneration is documented in Henry Dunster&#x27;s record book for Harvard College as a copy of a letter by two benefactors that Dunster recorded directly underneath his first design of the seal of Harvard College. The 1640 endowment letter was footnoted in 1647 by Theophilus, who wrote:
 The intention of the footnote was to indicate that his brother had finally been repaid, and apparently Nathaniel had in part used the money to further his education. As for the £100, Thomas Symonds , a carpenter who apparently assisted in the building of the college at Cambridge in 1639 and afterwards. was found to be in debt to one of the college&#x27;s creditors, John Cogan, for the same amount. The college building was poorly erected, and Symonds was the responsible party after Eaton left. Symonds and at least one of his assistants were ultimately incarcerated in debtor&#x27;s prison.

== Religious convictions ==
Eaton left for England around 1652, where he had already been accepted back by the Church of England and honoured as a parish priest, though obviously he had his scruples, and was said to waver between devotion to his newly found home and that to his former.

In all likelihood, that &quot;back and forthedness&quot; and covering up set up a scenario of confusion, which seems to have confused every recordkeeper involved. Eaton died in 1674 in King&#x27;s Bench Prison, where he had been incarcerated for a similar debt: quite probably the same £100 debt from which he had already been given relief. His imprisonment coincided with the Stuart Restoration, and was likely reposted on an old list that King Charles II&#x27;s father had kept concerning those of lingering or questionable indebtedness. He was given a burial service on 11 May 1674 at St George the Martyr, Southwark, Surrey, England.

== Confusion with Nathaniel Heaton of Boston ==

There was also Nathaniel (H)eaton, Heaten, wife, Elizabeth and children, who emigrated on the &quot;Griffin&quot; with William and Anne Marbury Hutchinson landing on 18 September 1634 in the town of Boston, but who spelled his name &quot;Heaton&quot;. This Nathaniel Heaten was made free on 25 May 1636. Nathaniel Eaton of this article only arrived on the &quot;Hector&quot; on 28 June 1637, and was made a Freeman on 9 June 1638. In 1903 a series of plans of Boston, showing existing ways and owners of property from 25 December 1630 to 25 December 1645 inclusive was published showing the work of cartographer, George Lamb. In these maps #98, Nathaniel Eaton is cited as a property owner in Boston from 1638 to 1645. The subject of this article, Nathaniel Eaton, was known to have left Cambridge in the fall of 1639 and relocated to Virginia by 1640. The Nathaniel Eaton cited in the Lamb map collection is most likely Nathaniel Heaton. This error may have caused further conflation of two individuals, Nathaniel Heaton (Boston), and Nathaniel Eaton (Cambridge). In &quot;The Crooked and Narrow Streets of the Town of Boston – 1630–1822&quot; [note 185] by Annie Haven Thwing, Nathaniel Heaton is accurately cited.

==Notes==
1. Cf. Samuel Eliot Morison &quot;Builders of the Bay Colony&quot; (1930) pp 190–191 where can be found his wife&#x27;s supposed confession that was obviously coerced. Allegations of embezzlement appear to be &quot;ex post facto&quot;, or after the fact, and when one compares the entries in: Thomas Lechford&#x27;s &quot;Note Book Kept by Thomas Lechford Lawyer, 1638–1641&quot; (1885), it can be seen that Nathaniel paid all his debts, and was even owed money by Thomas Lechford himself.

2. Cf. Nathaniel B. Shurtleff, M.D. &quot;Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England&quot; (1853, vol I) p. 275; and subsequent later trials such as the Salem Witch Trials where it can be seen that testimonies at trial, etc., were thereafter taken down.

3. According to Cotton Mather&#x27;s &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana&quot; (1702), the graduating class of 1642 included the following individuals:
:Benjamin Woodbridge
:Georgius [George] Downing
:Johannes Bulklæus [John Bulkeley]
:Gulielmus [William] Hubbard
:Samuel Bellingham
:Johannes Wilsonus [John Wilson]
:Henricus [Henry] Saltonstall
:Tobias Barnardus [Barnard]
:Nathanael Brusterus [Nathaniel Brewster]

4. James Savage, &quot;Winthrop&#x27;s Journal &quot;The History of New England&quot; 1630–1649&quot; (1825–26 edition). There are other versions, including the original 1649 version, but Savage&#x27;s annotated edition, or its 1853 revision, is considered to be the most comprehensive.

5. Many spelling variations exist, such as &quot;Greaves&quot; for &quot;Graves&quot;. Some authorities state that Ann was the daughter of Francis Graves, the son of Thomas Graves. She later married Francis Doughty as her third and final husband.

<text>Human rights in pre-Saddam Iraq were often lacking to various degrees among the various regimes that ruled the country. Human rights abuses in the country predated the rule of Saddam Hussein.

==1850 to 1920== 
Assyrian historian Eden Naby writes that the relations between Assyrians and Kurds have been marked by a &quot;bitter history&quot;, since Kurdish tribal chiefs in
Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, and northwest
Iran regularly attacked and plundered Christian tribes, and during World War I Kurds were
&quot;responsible for most of the atrocities committed against
the Assyrians in particular, due to proximity and a long
tradition of perceived Kurdish rights to pillage Assyrian
Christians and carry away women and goods&quot;, and that &quot;Kurdish expansion happened at the expense of Assyrians&quot;. In 1918, a Kurdish chieftain and his tribe assassinated the Patriarch
of the Church of the East at the negotiation dinner. It is known that the Iraqi Kurdistan have accepted more than 200,000 Christians refugees and IDPs who had fled from Arab areas between 2012 and 2016. It is also known that security officers and authorities who work for Barzani tribe and his political party, the KDP, have frequently abused some local Christians and IDPs for not being &quot;enough&quot; loyal to them.

From the mid 19th century, &quot;the Kurds carried out numerous massacres of Nestorians, culminating in 1915-1918 with the murder of about half of all the Nestorians and their patriarch Mar Shimun XIX - a genocide proportionally similar to the massacre of the Armenians.&quot; The important Rabban Hormizd Monastery and the Mar Mattai monastery in Iraq was plundered countless times by the Kurds. Nestorian libraris were destroyed by Turks and Kurds over the course of centuries. The Kurds murdered thousands of women and men, slicing off the ears of the dead and sending them to Badr Khan, and young women were sold as slaves. The Kurds also forcibly took possession of churches and convents, and they constantly abducted virgins, brides and women, forcing them to turn Muslim. Most notable are the first genocide carried out by Turks and Kurds in the period 1894 1896, and in 1915–1918. The Kurd Agha Simko assassinated the patriarch Mar Shimun XXI Benyamin.

== The British occupation of Iraq (1920–1932)==
In the 1920s, when Britain held a mandate from the League of Nations (predecessor of the United Nations), British occupational forces, under the command of Arthur Harris, used mustard gas and delayed action bombing to suppress Iraqi resistance to British rule, leading to numerous civilian casualties.

==The Hashemite monarchy (1932–1958)==
The Hashemite monarchy that took over Iraq from the British has been described as imperfect in terms of human rights, but in many ways better than the regimes that followed: 
:&quot;After the creation of Iraq as an independent kingdom in 1932, the monarchy [...] sought to maintain the status quo of Sunni dominance, prompting conflict between the Arab Sunni establishment and several minorities (such as the Assyrians and the Kurds). But the monarchy also sought solutions, compromises, and certain forms of elections and democratic expression.&quot; Because the regime&#x27;s legitimacy derived from its history in Arabia and its long experience in administration and ability to work with the British, it was able &quot;to lead with less repression and coercion.&quot;

Prime ministers, and at one point the leaders of a military coup, had enormous influence during the era of the monarchy, and civil rights varied at different points. According to a United States Library of Congress history of Iraq:

:In 1952 the depressed economic situation, which had been exacerbated by a bad harvest and by the government&#x27;s refusal to hold direct elections, triggered large-scale antiregime protests; the protests turned especially violent in Baghdad. In response, the government declared martial law, banned all political parties, suspended a number of newspapers, and imposed a curfew. The immense size of the protests showed how widespread dissatisfaction with the regime had become. The middle class, which had grown considerably as a result of the monarchy&#x27;s expanded education system, had become increasingly alienated from the regime, in large part because they were unable to earn an income commensurate with their status. Nuri as Said&#x27;s autocratic manner, his intolerance of dissent, and his heavy-handed treatment of the political opposition had further alienated the middle class, especially the army. Forced underground, the opposition had become more revolutionary.

===Repression of Assyrians===
In 1915, facing massacres that led to the deaths of up to two-thirds of the Assyrians in southeastern Turkey and northern Iran, about 50,000 survivors streamed over the border into northern Iraq, which was largely populated by Kurds and Turkomen. The refugees were housed in British-run refugee camps. Similar upheavals in 1918 in Iran led to more flows of refugees into Iraq, where Assyrian communities already had existed for centuries. These influxes led to decades of ethnic conflict.

Under the British mandate, Assyrians were organized into militia groups called &quot;the Assyrian Levies&quot; and were used to put down revolts and support the British military presence in Iraq. The Assyrians were abandoned by the British once Iraq achieved independence in 1933. In the summer of that year an armed group of 800 Assyrians crossed from Iraq into Syria, where there were many other Assyrians, to &quot;assert what they perceived as their legitimate national rights&quot;, according to Jonathan Eric Lewis, a political analyst. French colonial authorities in Syria forced them back into Iraq where the Iraqi military attacked them. On August 7, &quot;the Iraqi army and Kurdish irregulars, with genuine popular support, committed a massacre at Simele.&quot; According to Assyrian sources, the dead numbered 3,000 (other estimates put the number in the &quot;hundreds&quot;. &quot;No event has shaped Iraqi Assyrian collective identity more&quot;, Lewis wrote.

Assyrians have suffered persecution during the early 20th century, mainly at the hands of Kurdish tribes who persecuted them as individual tribes (Shakkak), and as Muslim allies of the Committee on Union and Progress working through the Ottoman armies during World War I, and later as Kurds who took part in the 1933 Simele massacre of Assyrians. In the early 1930s, the Iraqi ministries disseminated leaflets among the Kurds calling them to massacre Assyrians. This call appealed to Islamic convictions and united Arabs and Kurds against the infidel Christians. Shortly before the August 11 Simmele massacre in 1933, Kurds began a campaign of looting against Assyrian settlements. The Assyrians fled to Simele, where they were also persecuted. There were many accounts by witnesses of numerous atrocities perpetrated by Arabs and Kurds on Assyrian women. Under the command of Kurdish chieftain Bakr Sidqi on August 11 the perpetrators committed the Simele massacre which targeted men almost exclusively. Under the leadership of the Kurdish General Bakr Sidqi Kurds, Arabs and others united and committed the Simele massacre against Christian Assyrians and plundered their towns, and raped and murdered women and children. Since the 16th century after Sultan Selim I brought the Kurds and settled them in Assyrian lands, the Ottoman Empire began using Kurdish tribes to kill Christian Assyrians and Armenians systematically. In the beginning of World War I the Kurdish tribes, and which formed a Kurdish cavalry force in the Ottoman army known as the &quot;Hamidian Cavalry&quot; headed to the Assyrian plain villages in the east of what is today known as Turkey as well as the Assyrian villages in Tur Abdin and Hakkari and killed thousands of Assyrians. The Assyrian Patriarch Mar Binyamin Shimon (who was later assassinated by a Kurd) declared that the Assyrians joined the war on Russia&#x27;s side in self-defence and for liberation.

==Between the monarchy and Saddam Hussein (1958–1969)==
In the decade following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958, various regimes ruled the country, each responsible for the government&#x27;s treatment of its citizens and for protecting citizens, until the 1968 coup that brought the Ba&#x27;ath Party to power with Saddam Hussein as one of the coup leaders:

* Military government of Abd al-Karim Qasem and the &quot;Free Officers&quot; (1958–1963);
* First regime of the Ba&#x27;ath Arab Socialist Party (February–November 1963);
* Governments of the Arif brothers and Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz (1963–1968).

The second regime of the Ba&#x27;ath Arab Socialist Party began with a coup in July 1968, with Saddam Hussein, one of the leaders of the coup, growing in power and eventually assuming the presidency of the country in 1979. He was overthrown in the United States-led invasion of 2003.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Iraqis and many other Arabs often supported the idea of a strong leader &quot;along the lines of Stalin or Mao, Ho Chi Minh or Castro&quot; who would act as &quot;a political savior&quot;, acting with great power, a sense of mission and ruling with justice. Saladin, the eleventh-century Islamic hero who defeated the Crusaders, was looked on as a model and even Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, was viewed as a leader from whom an example could be drawn. In Iraq, many felt a strong leader was needed to hold the country together despite its ethnic divisions and other problems.

===Abd al-Karim Qasem and the &quot;Free Officers&quot; Regime (1958–1963)===
The 1958 military coup that overthrew the Hashemite monarchy brought to power members of &quot;rural groups that lacked the cosmopolitan thinking found among Iraqi elites&quot;. Iraq&#x27;s new leaders had an &quot;exclusivist mentality [that] produced tribal conflict and rivalry, which in turn called forth internal oppression [...]&quot;

According to Shafeeq N. Ghabra, a professor of political science at Kuwait University, and, in 2001, director of the Kuwait Information Office in Washington D.C.:

:After the 1958 revolution, Iraq&#x27;s ruling establishment created a state devoid of political compromise. Its leaders liquidated those holding opposing views, confiscated property without notice, trumped up charges against its enemies, and fought battles with imaginary domestic foes. This state of affairs reinforced an absolute leader and a militarized Iraqi society totally different from the one that existed during the monarchy.

Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis fled the country within four years of the 1958 revolution. In 1959 there was a massacre committed against the Iraqi Turkmen, known as the Kirkuk Massacre.

Assyrians fared rather well under the five-year regime, but since Baathist rule began again in 1968, they fared much worse, according to Jonathan Eric Lewis. &quot;As Baathist power increased, Assyrian influence and rights within Iraq decreased,&quot; he wrote in 2003.

A power struggle developed among the coup leaders Brigadier Abd al Karim Qasim and Colonel Abd as Salaam Arif. Arif&#x27;s pro-Nasserite sympathies were supported by the Baath Party, while Qasim found support for his anti-union position in the ranks of the communists. Qasim eventually emerged victorious, first dismissing Arif, then bringing him to trial for treason. He was condemned to death in January 1959, then pardoned in December 1962.

Aware of plotting for a coup by officers opposed to Qasim&#x27;s increasing links with the communists, Qasim had his communist allies mobilize 250,000 of their supporters in Mosul in March 1959. The coup attempt never materialized, but the communists massacred nationalists and some well-to-do Mosul families. As a result of the killings, and a riot in Kirkuk, Baath Party leaders decided assassination was the only way to dislodge Qasim. Their attempt to kill him, led by Saddam Hussein, failed while injuring Qasim, and the dictator reacted by aligning himself more with the communists and by suppressing the Baath and other nationalist parties. But by 1960 and 1961, Qasim decided the communists had become too strong and he moved against them, purging communists from sensitive government positions, cracking down on trade unions and on peasant associations, and shutting down the communist press.

===Various regimes (1963–1968)===
After Qasim was overthrown in 1963, the Baath Party took over. The party was small, with only 1,000 active members, and lacked a coherent program, having been held together largely by opposition to Qasim. Saadi, the leader of the Baathists, established a one-party state with little tolerance for opposing views. The Baath was overthrown by November 1963 in a military coup led by a small group of officers. For the next five years power shifted among the officers until 1968, when another coup brought the Baath back to power.

===The early Baathist regime (1968–1969)===
When the Baathists came back to power, two men, Saddam Hussein and Bakr, increasingly dominated the party. Although Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, by 1969 Saddam &quot;clearly had become the moving force behind the party.&quot;

== Ethnic conflicts ==
Human rights violations in Iraq often came from conflicts between the country&#x27;s rulers and members of distinct ethnic communities, especially the Kurds and Shiite Arabs, although Sunni Arabs, members of the minority that filled the top positions in the regimes after 1958 and through Saddam&#x27;s years in power, could feel the wrath of the rulers for reasons unrelated to ethnic conflict.

===Conflict with the Shi&#x27;a===
Ghabra has called the treatment of the Shi&#x27;a one of the worst political mistakes of the regimes after 1958. Writing in 2001, Ghabra said the post-1958 regimes dismissed the &quot;Shi&#x27;a majority and its rights, alienating them despite their commitment to Iraq.&quot;

===Conflict with the Kurds===
In the regimes that followed the 1958 overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy, human rights violations in Kurdistan occurred frequently as Kurdish nationalism conflicted with the goals of various Iraqi regimes, causing violence to break out when political negotiations broke down:

:[T]he Kurds encountered a familiar pattern under each of the regimes that followed: first a period of negotiations that invariably failed to satisfy Kurdish demands for autonomy, and then, when the talks broke down, renewed outbreaks of violence. Rural villages were bombed and burned and Kurdish fighters hunted down relentlessly. The name that they adopted expressed accurately the condition of their existence. They called themselves peshmerga — &quot;those who face death.&quot;

<doc id="660187" wikidata="Q1340889" url="?curid=660187" title="Tracheal tube">
<text>A tracheal tube is a catheter that is inserted into the trachea for the primary purpose of establishing and maintaining a patent airway and to ensure the adequate exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Many different types of tracheal tubes are available, suited for different specific applications:
* An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal).
* A tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube; this curved metal or plastic tube may be inserted into a tracheostomy stoma (following a tracheotomy) to maintain a patent lumen.
* A tracheal button is a rigid plastic cannula about in length that can be placed into the tracheostomy after removal of a tracheostomy tube to maintain patency of the lumen.

==History==
Portex Medical (England and France) produced the first cuff-less plastic &#x27;Ivory&#x27; endotracheal tubes. Ivan Magill later added a cuff (these were glued on by hand to make the famous Blue-line tube copied by many other manufacturers). Maeterlinck GmbH developed the disposable endotracheal tube and produced many design variations, adding the &#x27;Murphy Eye&#x27; to their tubes in case of &#x27;accidental&#x27; placement of the tube to avoid right bronchial occlusion. David S. Sheridan was one of the manufacturers of the American markets &quot;disposable&quot; plastic tracheal tube now used routinely in surgery. Previously, red rubber (Rusch-Germany) tubes were used, then sterilized for re-use. 

==Applications==
Tracheal tubes can also be used to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. Tracheal tubes may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as salbutamol, atropine, epinephrine, ipratropium, and lidocaine. Tracheal tubes are commonly used for airway management in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation, and emergency medicine.

==Endotracheal tube==


Most endotracheal tubes today are constructed of polyvinyl chloride, but specialty tubes constructed of silicone rubber, latex rubber, or stainless steel are also widely available. Most tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal the trachea and bronchial tree against air leakage and aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions, and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to pediatric patients (in small children, the cricoid cartilage, the narrowest portion of the pediatric airway, often provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation).

Types of endotracheal tubes include oral or nasal, cuffed or uncuffed, preformed (e.g. RAE (Ring, Adair, and Elwyn) tube), reinforced tubes, and double-lumen endobronchial tubes. For human use, tubes range in size from 2 to 10.5 mm in internal diameter (ID). The size is chosen based on the patient&#x27;s body size, with the smaller sizes being used for pediatric and neonatal patients. Tubes larger than 6 mm ID usually have an inflatable cuff. Originally made from red rubber, most modern tubes are made from polyvinyl chloride. Those placed in a laser field may be flexometallic. Robertshaw (and others) developed double-lumen endobronchial tubes for thoracic surgery. These allow single-lung ventilation while the other lung is collapsed to make surgery easier. The deflated lung is re-inflated as surgery finishes to check for fistulas (tears). Another type of endotracheal tube has a small second lumen opening above the inflatable cuff, which can be used for suction of the nasopharngeal area and above the cuff to aid extubation (removal). This allows suctioning of secretions that sit above the cuff which helps reduce the risk of chest infections in long-term intubated patients.

The &quot;armored&quot; endotracheal tubes are cuffed, wire-reinforced, silicone rubber tubes that are quite flexible but yet difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Polyvinyl chloride tubes are relatively stiff in comparison. Preformed tubes (such as the oral and nasal RAE tubes, named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) are also widely available for special applications. These may also be constructed of polyvinyl chloride or wire-reinforced silicone rubber. Other tubes (such as the Bivona Fome-Cuf tube) are designed specifically for use in laser surgery in and around the airway. Various types of double-lumen endotracheal (actually, endobronchial) tubes have been developed (Carlens, White, Robertshaw, etc.) for ventilating each lung independently—this is useful during pulmonary and other thoracic operations.

==Tracheostomy tube==

Several types of tracheostomy tubes are available, depending on the requirements of the patient, including Shiley, Bivona (a silicon tube with metal rings that are good for airways with damage to the tracheal rings or otherwise not straight), and fenestrated.

==Tracheal button==
A tracheal button is generally used in people with severe obstructive sleep apnea, who often wear this device during waking hours and remove it while sleeping to ensure a patent airway and reduce the risk of asphyxiation. Since the tube does not extend far into the trachea, it is easy to breathe and speak with the device in place.

<text>A laryngeal mask airway (LMA), also known as laryngeal mask, is a medical device that keeps a patient&#x27;s airway open during anaesthesia or while they are unconscious. It is a type of supraglottic airway device. They are most commonly used by anaesthetists to channel oxygen or inhalational anaesthetic to the lungs during surgery and in the pre-hospital setting (for instance by paramedics and emergency medical technicians) for unconscious patients.

A laryngeal mask is composed of an airway tube that connects to an elliptical mask with a cuff which is inserted through the patient&#x27;s mouth, down the windpipe, and once deployed forms an airtight seal on top the glottis (unlike tracheal tubes which pass through the glottis) allowing a secure airway to be managed by a health care provider.

The laryngeal mask was invented by British anaesthesiologist Archibald Brain in the early 1980s, and in December 1987 the first commercial laryngeal mask was made available in the United Kingdom. The laryngeal mask is still widely used today worldwide, and a variety of specialised laryngeal masks exist.

==Uses==
It channels oxygen and inhalational anaesthetic to the lungs. It can be used during anaesthesia, or while a patient is unconscious. Laryngeal mask airways are designed to be an easy way to secure the airway and ventilate a patient – they are easier to place than tracheal intubation due to the lack of muscle relaxants and laryngoscopy. They are also less likely to damage teeth or the larynx itself. It may form an air-tight seal. Cuffs are available in multiple sizes.

LMAs can be alternatives to the use of a face mask when using a bag-valve-mask device to prevent gastric insufflation.

== Contraindications ==
A laryngeal mask airway is generally not used in surgeries where there is a high risk that stomach contents may be aspirated. This is particularly for surgeries that last longer than 2 hours. It often uses low inflation pressures, so may not be appropriate in patients with illnesses that cause low lung compliance. As it is typically larger and more obstructive than tracheal intubation, it is generally not used for surgery of the mouth and throat.

It should not be used for conscious patients because of the risk of stimulating the gag reflex.

== Complications ==
A laryngeal mask leaves more anatomical dead space in the trachea than with tracheal intubation. This can decrease the oxygenation of the lungs and the removal of carbon dioxide. It also slightly increases airway resistance. More serious complications include vomiting while the laryngeal mask airway is in place (potentially leading to aspiration of stomach contents).

Although the laryngeal mask airway is specifically designed to be easy to place, it is possible for the ventilation it provides to be inadequate. This may be due to variations in neck anatomy, abnormal neck position, dislodgement of the cuff, the mask not being long enough to reach the larynx (or more rarely too long), or folding of the mask in the pharynx. For these reasons, radiology can be used to ensure that the laryngeal mask airway is in the correct position.

== Technique ==
A laryngeal mask airway has an airway tube that connects to an elliptical mask with a cuff. The cuff can either be an inflating type (achieved after insertion using a syringe of air), or self-sealing.

A laryngeal mask airway must first be completely sterilised (it may be reused many times). Standard checks for common use defects should be performed (such as cracks in the plastic). For an inflatable cuff, the cuff should be inflated and deflated outside the patient to ensure it is functional. A pen-like grip is used to move it through the patient&#x27;s mouth and throat, preferably when their head is extended to straighten the airway. The laryngeal mask airway should be lubricated so that it can be placed more easily.

Once inserted correctly (and the cuff inflated where relevant), the mask conforms to the anatomy with the bowl of the mask facing the space between the vocal cords. The tip of the laryngeal mask sits in the throat against the upper oesophageal sphincter.

==History==

===Concept===
Archie Brain began studying the anatomy and physiology of the upper airway in relation to existing airways. Brain concluded that current techniques for connecting artificial airways to the patient were not ideal. He reasoned that if the respiratory tree is seen as a tube ending at the glottis and the objective is to connect this tube to an artificial airway, the most logical solution was to create a direct end-to-end junction. Existing airway devices failed to form this junction; the face-mask sealed against the face, and the endotracheal tube penetrated too far so that the junction was created within the trachea, instead of at its beginning.

===First study===
The first study of a laryngeal mask in 23 patients was conducted at London Hospital in 1982. Insertion and ventilation using the laryngeal mask in 16 anaesthetised, paralysed female patients was successful, achieving a seal greater than 20 cm H2O in all patients. Emergence from anaesthesia was also noted to be uneventful and only 3 patients complained of a sore throat, a marked contrast to endotracheal tube anaesthesia. Following the success of the initial study, Brain successfully inserted and ventilated 6 anaesthetised, non-paralysed patients. Finding no difference between the first and second group of patients, Brain realised that muscle relaxation was not required for insertion. Finally, Dr Brain used the device in a dental extraction patient, he realised that because the space in and around the glottis was filled by the mask, the need for packing was much reduced and more impressively the larynx was completely protected from surgical debris. Brain realised the exciting possibility that the laryngeal mask could be applied to head and neck surgery and also observed that &quot;In two patients the anatomy was such as to suggest that endotracheal intubation might have presented at least moderate difficulty. Neither presented difficulty with regard to insertion of the laryngeal mask &quot;. By 1985, experience with the laryngeal mask prototype had reached 4000 cases. Brain published a case series in Anaesthesia in 1985 describing the management of 3 difficult airway patients, illustrating the use of the laryngeal mask for airway rescue. Brain with 5 co-authors published a second paper in anaesthesia describing the use of the laryngeal mask in over 500 patients, adding considerable credence to the laryngeal mask concept. However the limitation of the prototypes remained, a new material was urgently needed.

===Search for new material===
Following the realisation that a new material was needed, Brain looked at a number of options; polyvinyl chloride was too rigid and synthetic foam did not lend itself to re-use. Silicone prototypes looked promising as what was produced was an ellipse with a flat central web which, if cut correctly, could be used to create an aperture bar to prevent the epiglottis falling into the distal aperture. The silicone prototype was also smooth and deflated into a wafer thin ellipse, however, the silicone mask was unable to retain the desired bowl shape and it was no longer possible to make rapid adjustments to the design. The silicone Dunlop prototype was superior to the Goldman prototype, one of Brain&#x27;s first prototypes created from the cuff of a latex Goldman dental mask, however Brain needed a material that would give him design flexibility before the next set of silicone moulds were cast. In 1986, Brain continued to make prototypes from latex with a range of modifications; the inclusion of an inflation line, a thin-walled elliptical ring in the cuff which resulted in equal expansion of the cuff, the creation of a larger size to increase the reliability of cuff seal pressure and a moulded back plate for the cuff. By December 1986, Brain was ready to conduct the first wholly independent trial and chose John Nunn to be the recipient of the silicone prototypes to conduct the trial. &quot;There were three outstanding advantages of the LMA in patients who breathed spontaneously. Firstly, excellent airway patency was obtained in 98% of patients and did not deteriorate during the course of the anaesthetic. Secondly, as no manual support of the jaw was necessary the hands of the anaesthetist were freed for monitoring, record keeping and other tasks. Thirdly, it was possible to maintain a clear airway throughout transfer of the patient to the recovery room.&quot; The publication of this trial in 1989 was critical in kickstarting the uptake of the laryngeal mask in the UK&quot;.

===First commercial laryngeal mask===
On 5 December 1987, Brain received the first case of all-factory-made, silicone cuffed, LMA Classic laryngeal mask distributed by The Laryngeal Mask Company Limited. The LMA Classic was launched in the UK and the British anaesthesia community were quick to realise the potential benefits of the laryngeal mask. Within 3 years of launch in the UK, the device had been used in at least 2 million patients and was available in every hospital. By 1992, the laryngeal mask was approved for sale and being sold in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, India and the United States. The anaesthesia community had been calling for practice guidelines and in 1992 the ASA commissioned a task force to establish practice guidelines for managing difficult airway situations. The ASA algorithm for difficult airways was published in 1993 and stressed an early attempt at insertion of the laryngeal mask if face mask ventilation was not adequate. The laryngeal mask revolutionised anaesthetic practice and by 1995 had been used in excess of 100 million patients and was available in more than 80 countries throughout the world. The laryngeal mask had now been widely accepted as a form of airway management. From 1988 to 2017, more than 200 million patients used laryngeal mask. 

Between 1989 and 2000 a variety of specialised laryngeal masks were released which included the LMA Flexible (1990), LMA Fastrach (1997), LMA Unique (1997) and LMA ProSeal (2000), all offered by The Laryngeal Mask Company.

<text>The codice_1 command is a command-line network utility included in Windows NT operating systems since Windows 2000 that combines the functionality of ping with that of tracert. It is used to locate spots that have network latency and network loss.

==Overview==
The command provides details of the path between two hosts and ping-like statistics for each node in the path based on samples taken over a time period, depending on how many nodes are between the start and end host.

The advantages of codice_2 over codice_3 and codice_4 are that each node is pinged as the result of a single command, and that the behavior of nodes is studied over an extended time period, rather than the default ping sample of four messages or default traceroute single route trace. The disadvantage is that it takes a total of 25 seconds per hop to show the ping statistics.

==Syntax==
The command-syntax is:

 pathping [-g host-list] [-h maximum_hops] [-i address] [-n]
 [-p period] [-q num_queries] [-w timeout] [-P] [-R] [-T]
 [-4] [-6] target_name

Options:
*codice_5 Loose source route along host-list.
*codice_6 Maximum number of hops to search for target.
*codice_7 Use the specified source address.
*codice_8 Do not resolve addresses to hostnames.
*codice_9 Wait period milliseconds between pings.
*codice_10 Number of queries per hop.
*codice_11 Wait timeout milliseconds for each reply.
*codice_12 Test for RSVP PATH connectivity.
*codice_13 Test if each hop is RSVP aware.
*codice_14 Test connectivity to each hop with Layer-2 priority tags.
*codice_15 Force using IPv4.
*codice_16 Force using IPv6.

<text>Richard Stephen Berry (April 9, 1931 – July 26, 2020) was an American professor of physical chemistry.

He was the James Franck Distinguished Service Professor, emeritus, at The University of Chicago. He was also special advisor for national security to the director, at Argonne National Laboratory.

==Career and research==
A native of Denver, Colorado, Berry joined the Chicago faculty in 1964, having been an assistant professor at Yale University and, between 1957 and 1960, an instructor at the University of Michigan. At the University of Chicago, he has been a member of the department of chemistry, the James Franck Institute, the College, and, for many years, the Committee and then the School of Public Policy Studies.

He was home secretary of the National Academy of Sciences from 1999 until 2003. He has written one book, been co-author of four others, one with Stuart A. Rice and John Ross, another with Linda Gaines and Thomas V. Long, another with Vladimir Kazakov, Stanislaw Sieniutycz, Zbigniew Szwast, and Anatoly Tsirlin, and one with Boris Smirnov. He was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1983.

His scientific studies have included both experimental and theoretical work. His doctoral thesis, directed by William Moffitt, was on the subject of the electronic structure of butadiene. He then went on to study alkali halides in the gas phase, first at the University of Michigan and then at Yale, using shock waves to produce sufficient dissociation of the molecules to ions to make it feasible to observe the photodetachment spectra of the halide ions, thus determining the electron affinities of the halogen atoms to four or five significant figures. He worked at Michigan with Martin Stiles to observe the free benzyne in the gas phase, and then, at Yale, with a graduate student Margaret Emery and an undergraduate Jon Clardy, they found the meta and para isomers of benzyne. He also worked with Walter Lwowski to study nitrenes in the gas phase.

In 1964, he moved to The University of Chicago, where he has worked on atomic and ionic collision processes, photoionization, the nature of correlation of valence electrons in atoms, and, more recently, on atomic and molecular clusters, and on protein dynamics. He became interested in energy and its efficient use first through concern about Chicago&#x27;s air pollution in the 1960s. This led to what we believe is one of the first public studies of what has become called &quot;life cycle analysis.&quot; This was an analysis of the actual and ideal limiting energy and free energy use in the manufacture and disposal of the automobile, and was carried out with Margaret F. Fels. This led to many other such analyses, which now are done very frequently. This work, in turn, stimulated what has become known as &quot;finite-time thermodynamics,&quot; the study of the optimal performance of processes constrained to operate in finite time or at nonzero rates. He has been very active in the study of atomic and molecular clusters, particularly in their phases and phase changes. This has led to a broader interest in bridging between the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of physical systems, especially of finding the boundary below which a macroscopic description fails.

His interests, apart from traditional scientific studies, have included energy and energy policy (which he was teaching with the economist George Tolley), scientific integrity issues, scientific information, its distribution and its contributions to policy and governmental decisions including those of the courts, and science education, particularly the problem of science illiteracy.

==Personal life==
Berry was married to Carla Friedman Berry. They had two grown daughters, one son, five grandsons, and three granddaughters. He died in July 2020 in Chicago.

<text>Cornwall County was a county of the former Province of New York, established on September 5, 1665 from of land that had been granted to the Duke of York in modern Maine. As established, the grant ran all the way from the St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean, between the Kennebec and St. Croix rivers, and produced what today is most of Aroostook, Piscataquis, Washington, Hancock, Penobscot, Waldo, Knox, Lincoln, Kennebec, Somerset, and Sagadahoc counties.

==History==
On October 7, 1673, Massachusetts, relying on a new survey of its northern border, and responding to the Dutch capture of New York in August 1673 as a result of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, claimed of the Duke of York&#x27;s territory east of the Kennebec River in present-day Maine, including the Pemaquid settlement, and established a new county there. On May 27, 1674, this county was named Devonshire. Cornwall was implicitly reduced to the area north of the Massachusetts claim. Cornwall and Devonshire were lost to the Abenaki Indians in King Philip&#x27;s War in the Autumn of 1675. Cornwall County was recreated on November 1, 1683, conforming to the original grant, still part of New York. Cornwall continued unchanged until the Spring of 1687, when it was transferred to the expanded Dominion of New England, extinguishing New York&#x27;s claim to the land. Cornwall County was transferred from New England to Massachusetts in 1692 and called Yorkshire. Much of this region became part of Maine when it was split from Massachusetts in 1820.

<doc id="660213" wikidata="Q25202820" url="?curid=660213" title="Clumping (biology)">
<text>Clumping is a behavior in an organism, usually sessile, in which individuals of a particular species group close to one another for beneficial purposes. Clumping can be caused by the abiotic environment surrounding an organism. Barnacles, for example, group together on rocks that are exposed for the least amount of time during the low tide. Usually, clumping in sessile animals starts when one organism binds to a hard substrate, such as rock, and other members of the same species attach themselves afterwards. Herbivorous snails are known to clump around where sufficient algae are present. The clumping of mussels (shown right) has been found to be influenced by competition with other species. The mussels attach themselves by byssal threads to potential competitors for space.

==Causes==
=== Predation avoidance ===
Clumping and increased locomotion has been found to occur with organisms such as blue mussels (&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot;) due to risks from predators such as the European lobster (&quot;Homarus gammarus&quot;). Trade-offs exist with clumping such as decreased growth and less reproductive activity from mussels clumping together due to predation. However, there are also benefits obtained, such as decreased mortality from predation and adverse weather conditions, from clumping.

Clumping has been practiced by bivalve organisms from the times of the fossil record, and the trade-offs between living quite an aggregated lifestyle. Predators such as the gastropod &quot;Nucella lamellosa&quot; utilize drilling techniques in order to hunt prey such as the blue mussels, and the latter&#x27;s clumping strategies results in significantly less drilling frequency overall. However, the average drilling placement and variation by the gastropod did not show variation as a result of clumping.

== Measurement ==
Measuring clumped populations of organisms in nature can prove challenging at times for researchers. Quadrat sampling, a favored method by ecologists to study the density of populations, is not as effective with criteria such as those groups that are clumped. Other methods instead can be utilized to measure clumped populations, such as the line-intercept method which is more popular with organisms that can be studied and identified before they move. The reasoning behind organisms clumping revolve around resources being restrained in smaller regions within larger ones and select organisms forming social groups. The funnel-web spider (&quot;Agelenopsis aperta&quot;) at smaller scales are evenly distributed in their habitats, but are a clumped species on larger scales. The reasoning for this is two-fold. Firstly, these types of spiders prefer environments with the ability to attract insect prey and have favorable thermal properties. Secondly, there is a limited space for spiders to establish their websites, and competition for these spaces is substantial. However, on a macro scale, most organisms actually have clumped distributions due to their habitats not being eventually distributed over extensive areas. Similar trends are seen with other species of spiders. &quot;Stegodyphus lineatus&quot; sees disadvantages no matter what other parameters exist when feeding in large groups. Otherwise, these types of spiders were able to survive in close proximity most effectively when they were of approximate equal size. The size of groups also played a role in the ability of these spiders to live.

== Cellular clumping ==
The practice of clumping occurs at both the macro and micro level for organisms. Closely tied to the endosymbiotic theory, there exists significant evidence that single-celled organisms in the distant past evolved and combined with other organisms to create complex multi-cellular lifeforms that make up much of life in the present. This was despite the fact that these single-celled organisms were capable of sustaining themselves and reproducing to create future generations. Nevertheless, this occurrence is considered to be a major transition in the evolution of life. The benefits of these multi-cellular lifeforms forming include further advances in efficiency to already existing ways that single-celled organisms cooperated; the creation of extracellular &quot;public goods&quot; is an example of organisms gaining from clumping. However, cooperation could still evolve and coexist alongside clumping as a strategy for organisms. As genetic similarity strengthened between organisms that clumped, both &quot;public goods&quot; production and clumping itself became more prevalent and easier to accomplish in the case of the latter. In addition, just small changes in genetic similarity can cause major shifts the outcome of evolution for organisms, such as increased output of vital materials for survival and growth. Clumping can be impeded when the number of organisms that benefits must be shared with increases, but stimulated when those organisms are more related to one another.

<doc id="660216" wikidata="Q13047" url="?curid=660216" title="Alpha Librae">
<text>Alpha Librae (α Librae, abbreviated Alpha Lib, α Lib) is a double star and, despite its &#x27;alpha&#x27; designation, it is the second-brightest star system (or star) in the constellation of Libra. The two components are designated α1 Librae and α2 Librae. The system bore the traditional name of Zubenelgenubi , though the International Astronomical Union now regards that name as only applying to α2 Librae.

Alpha2 Librae is 0.33 degrees north of the ecliptic so it can be occulted by the Moon and (very rarely) by planets. It was occulted by Venus on October 25, 1947; the next occultation by a planet will be by Mercury on 10 November 2052. Both components are eclipsed (occulted) by the sun from about 7–9 November. Thus the star can be viewed the whole night, crossing the sky, in early May.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;α Librae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Librae&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation.

&quot;Zubenelgenubi&quot; , also rendered &quot;Zuben Elgenubi&quot;, derives from the Arabic ّالزُبَانَى الجَنُوبِي &quot;al-zubānā al-janūbiyy&quot; &quot;the southern claw&quot;, which was coined before Libra was recognized as a constellation distinct from Scorpius. The alternative name &quot;Kiffa Australis&quot; (&quot;Elkhiffa Australis&quot;) is a partial Latin translation of the Arabic &quot;al-kiffah al-janubiyyah&quot; &quot;الكفة الجنوبية&quot; &quot;southern pan [of the scales]&quot;. Another name used in older astronomy texts, equivalent to &quot;southern pan&quot;, was &quot;Lanx Australis&quot;.

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Zubenelgenubi&quot; for &quot;α2 Librae&quot; on 21 August 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Root&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of α2 Librae, ι Librae, γ Librae and β Librae. Consequently, the Chinese name for α2 Librae itself is (), &quot;the First Star of Root&quot;.

== Properties ==
Alpha Librae is about from the Sun. 
The two brightest components of Alpha Librae form a double star moving together through space as common proper motion companions. They are separated in the sky by an angular distance of 231&quot; (3&#x27;51&quot;). The position angle of the companion is 314 degrees. The brighter of the two is a white star of spectral type A3, with an apparent magnitude of 2.8. Its companion is a type F4 star of apparent brightness 5.2. They are probably members of the Castor Moving Group of stars that have a similar motion through space and share a common origin some 200 million years ago.

=== Alpha2 Librae ===
The brightest member, α2 Librae, is itself a spectroscopic binary system. The components have similar masses (mass ratio of 0.92) but the primary has a rotational velocity three times higher than its companion, which could be caused by them having significantly misaligned spin axes or if the primary is a merger product. 
=== Alpha1 Librae ===
The second member, α1 Librae, is separated from the primary system by around . It too is a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 5,870 days and an angular separation of 0.383 arcseconds; equal to about 10 AU. 
=== KU Librae ===
The system may have a fifth component, the star KU Librae at a separation of 2.6°, thus forming a hierarchical quintuple star system. KU Lib shares a similar motion through space to the Alpha Librae system, but is separated from the other stars by about a parsec. It is sufficiently close to be gravitationally bound to the other members, but has a substantially different metallicity, making it unlikely to be physically bound to the system.

<doc id="660219" wikidata="Q5075473" url="?curid=660219" title="Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe">
<text>Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe, (21 September 1867 – 3 July 1958) was a British Conservative politician and colonial governor. He was Governor-General of New Zealand from 1930 to 1935.

==Early life==
Bathurst was born in London, the second son of Charles Bathurst, of Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, and Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel Thomas Hay by Georgette Arnaud. He was educated at Sherborne School, Eton College and then University College, Oxford, where he graduated with a law degree in 1890. He then studied law and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1892, when he gained a Master of Arts from Oxford. He was also called to the bar. He inherited Lydney Park on the death of his elder brother.

==Member of Parliament and the First World War==
Bathurst worked as a barrister and conveyancer. In 1910 he entered parliament representing the Conservative Party as MP for the South or Wilton division of Wiltshire. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food.

During the First World War of 1914–1918, Bathurst joined the Royal Engineers Special Reserves, and then served in Southern Command as Assistant Military Secretary at the War Office. He carried out the task of ensuring the country had a supply of sugar when asked to chair the Royal Commission on Sugar Supply until 1919. Bathurst was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1917, and raised to the peerage as Baron Bledisloe of Lydney in the County of Gloucester on 15 October 1918. He remained in parliament until 1928, serving as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1924 onwards. The following year Bristol University granted him an honorary Doctorate of Science. He served as a member of the Privy Council from 1926. Stanley Baldwin appointed Lord Bledisloe to chair the Royal Commission on Land Drainage, probably owing to his own experiences on the banks of the Severn in Gloucestershire. This was his last such honour before being posted overseas.

==Governor-General of New Zealand==
After leaving parliament, Lord Bledisloe was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George and invested a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem on appointment as the fourth Governor-General of New Zealand, an office he held from 1930 until 1935, proving to be well liked and respected.
His social conscience was much appreciated during the Depression era, as was his insistence that his salary should be cut as were the salaries of public servants at the time. Bledisloe also contributed to improved Pākehā–Māori relations, purchasing the site where the Treaty of Waitangi was signed and presenting it to the nation as a memorial. In 1934, the site was dedicated as a national reserve. The dedication ceremony attracted thousands of people, both Māori and Pākehā. Bledisloe continued to take an interest in the site even after his term expired and he returned to England. He also contributed to the recognition of the Māori King Movement by developing a friendship with King Koroki and Te Puea Herangi, and his willingness to use the title &quot;king&quot; without reticence.

Bledisloe also promoted various causes and events by the presentation of trophies, notably the Bledisloe Cup, the trophy for an ongoing rugby union competition between New Zealand and Australia, first awarded in 1932, and currently contested annually. He also initiated the New Zealand Chess Federation inter-club championship trophy, also called the Bledisloe Cup.

Bledisloe was a freemason. During his term as governor-general, he was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New Zealand.

==Later life==
In 1935, Bledisloe was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal, honorary doctorate of civil laws (DCL) from Oxford, and honorary doctorate of Law (LLD) from Edinburgh. Upon returning to England he was elevated on 24 June 1935 to Viscount Bledisloe, of Lydney in the County of Gloucester. He continued to serve on a number of committees and councils, and was made a fellow of University College, Oxford and Pro-Vice Chancellor of Bristol. He received the King&#x27;s Coronation Medal from George VI in 1937 and was admitted at the same time as Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.

Bledisloe was a director of Lloyds Bank and the Australian Mutual Provident Society; and latterly also of the P &amp; O Steamship Company.

Lord Bledisloe chaired the Bledisloe Commission, also known as the Rhodesia-Nyasaland Royal Commission, appointed in 1937–39 to examine the possible closer union of the three British territories in Central Africa: Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. These territories were to some degree economically inter-dependent, and it was suggested that an association would promote their rapid development. (The three territories would ultimately unite as the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953.)

In 1943, he created the Empire Knowledge Trophies, a school competition to promote the British Empire to grammar and secondary technical schools. The competition was organized by the Gloucestershire Education Committee. Lord Blesdisloe himself often attended to present the prizes to the pupils.

On his 90th birthday he endowed the Bledisloe Gold Medal for Landowners of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, to be awarded annually for the application of science or technology to some branch of British husbandry.

Bledisloe died, aged 90, at Lydney on 3 July 1958, and was succeeded as Viscount Bledisloe by his eldest son, Benjamin Ludlow Bathurst.

==Family==
Charles Bathurst married Hon Bertha Susan, daughter of Henry Lopes, 1st Baron Ludlow by Cordelia Clark. They had two boys and a girl.
* Benjamin Ludlow, 2nd Viscount Bledisloe (1899–1979)
* Ursula Mary (1900–1975), married Horace Field Parshall Jr. (1903–1986) on 14 May 1929; divorced 1942.
* Hon. Henry Charles Hiley (1904–1969)
Bertha died in 1926 and Bathurst remarried in 1928 to Alina Kate Elaine Cooper-Smith (née Jenkins), the daughter of Lord Glantawe. Alina died in 1956.

==Sports==
Upon its formation in 1888, Bathurst was invited to become President of Lydney Rugby Football Club. He held this position for 70 years until his death and was succeeded as by his eldest son, Benjamin. The Australia – New Zealand Bledisloe Cup, and Bledisloe Park sports ground in New Zealand, are named for Bledisloe.

<text>Atlas , designation 27 Tauri, is a triple star system in the constellation of Taurus. It is a member of the Pleiades, an open star cluster (M45). It is 431 light-years (132 parsecs) away, and is 3.92 degrees north of the ecliptic.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;27 Tauri&quot; is the star&#x27;s Flamsteed designation.

In 2016 the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Atlas&quot; for this star on 21 August 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

==Mythology==

Atlas was a Titan and the father of the Pleiades sisters in Greek mythology.

==Properties==
Atlas is a triple star system, with the inner pair orbiting in under a year and the outer star orbiting in 260 years. The outer star, component Ab (sometimes component B, such as in CCDM and SIMBAD), has been resolved at a distance of from the unresolved spectroscopic binary. It is too close to have been assigned a spectral class, but has an apparent magnitude of 6.8, three magnitudes fainter than the combined magnitude of the closer pair. Its mass is estimate to be twice that of the Sun. In the WDS catalog, there are 8 other stars, ranging from B-I, which have been classed as companions of Atlas.
The inner pair have a well-defined orbit with a period of 291 days, a semi-major axis of , and an eccentricity of 0.24. At an inclination of 108°, it is not thought to show eclipses. Although the two stars cannot be resolved, the primary, component Aa1, is calculated to be 1.6 magnitudes brighter than the secondary, component Aa2.

Low amplitude variability of the brightness of Atlas was tentatively detected in observations by STEREO and clearly detected by Kepler/K2. The light curve varies with several periods, the most prominent being 2.427, 0.7457 and 1.214 days.
