<text>The Trans-Am Series presented by Pirelli is a sports car racing series held in North America. Founded in 1966, it is sanctioned by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA). Primarily based in the United States, the series competes on a variety of track types including road courses and street circuits. Trans-Am is split into the TA and TA2 classes for silhouette racing cars, while its production classes are the GT (grand touring), SGT (super grand touring), and XGT (extreme grand touring).

It was known as the CRC Chemicals Trans-Am Championship (1981–1983), the SCCA Budweiser Trans-Am Championship (1983–1984), the SCCA Bendix Brakes Trans-Am Championship (1985–1987), the SCCA Escort Trans-Am Series (1988) the SCCA Liquid Tide Trans-Am Tour (1991), the SCCA Tide Trans-Am Tour (1992), the NTB Trans-Am Series (1998), the BFGoodrich Trans-Am Series (1999–2000), the Trans-Am Series for the BFGoodrich Cup (2001–2002), the Motorock Trans-Am Tour for the BFGoodrich Cup (2003), the Motorock Trans-Am Series (2004), and the Muscle Milk SCCA Trans-Am Series (2009).

==Origins==
The Trans-Am Series was created in 1966 by Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) President John Bishop. Originally known as the Trans-American Sedan Championship, the name was changed to the Trans-American Championship for 1967 and henceforth. The series has in fact gone by at least twenty different names through the years. Some were linked to sponsors, some not. It has evolved over time from its original format as a Manufacturers&#x27; Championship series for modified passenger sedans and coupés to its current form as a Drivers&#x27; / Manufacturers&#x27; Championship Series that is open to GT style racecars. Champion drivers have been officially recognized, and Drivers&#x27; Championships awarded since the 1972 season. The series was cancelled after 2006 but was revived in 2009, using SCCA GT-1 based cars.

Over the years, the series has raced on a variety of different types of race tracks (Permanent and temporary road courses / street circuits / airport circuits) all over the country, as well as at venues in Canada, Mexico, and even San Juan, Puerto Rico in 2003. Since 2015, Trans Am has been a national series (Continental U.S. only), racing at tracks primarily throughout the East Coast, South, and Midwest. In 2017, the new stand-alone West Coast Championship was added to the Trans-Am Series. Currently, there are six races on the schedule, two of which are joint, or &quot;shared&quot; races with the national Championship series, in which drivers from both championship series race together in the same races, but only earn points in the championship series that they are entered in. The Trans Am series also awards the Northern Cup and Southern Cup which give points in certain races of the national series for competitors who do not run the full season.

==Current series format==
===Tire suppliers and presenting sponsor===
In 2017, Pirelli became the exclusive tire supplier (replacing Hoosier Racing Tire) and presenting sponsor for the Trans Am Series, and all classes use Pirelli P ZERO radial ply racing slicks. The change from bias ply tires to Pirelli P ZERO radial tires has been very well received, and has resulted in faster average speeds and improved lap times in all four classes.

=== Schedules ===
In late 2016, the Trans Am Race Company (TARC) announced that after a long absence, the Trans Am Series would return to the West Coast with the 2017 Trans Am West Coast Championship, partnering with the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association (SVRA). The West Coast Championship Series consists of a separate 3 race competition, plus one round that is shared with the Trans Am Championship Series at Circuit of the Americas. (3 permanent road courses / 1 temporary road course)

For 2017, the schedule was reorganized, with five race venues (Homestead-Miami Speedway, Road Atlanta, Watkins Glen, Virginia International Raceway, and New Jersey Motorsports Park) receiving new dates, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway being added, and Louisiana&#x27;s NOLA Motorsports Park being dropped.

For 2018, the Brainerd, MN and New Jersey Motorsports Park races were dropped, and a race at the Pittsburgh International Race Complex was added for the TA, TA3, and TA4 classes only. There are now 12 race venues on the Trans Am Championship Series schedule (8 permanent road courses / 3 temporary road courses / 1 temporary street circuit), with the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix presented by Lear race being open to TA2 class cars only. There are actually 13 actual races on the schedule, as the TA2 cars race twice in Detroit.

For 2018, the West Coast Championship&#x27;s race at Willow Springs, CA was dropped, Sonoma, CA was added, and a shared race at INDY was added, expanding their series to a separate 3 round competition, plus two shared races (3 permanent road courses / 2 temporary road courses).

The schedule for 2019 continues to be 12 races long (including two &quot;shared events&quot; with the West Coast Championship Series), but the mid-April Homestead, Florida race date changes to an early May event at Weathertech Raceway, Laguna Seca, California—the first time the series has raced there since 2004. The early August Pittsburgh race was also dropped, having been replaced by the Memorial Day Motorsports Festival at Connecticut&#x27;s Lime Rock Park, the first time the series will have raced there in three years, and it will be the thirtieth time overall. Additionally, the Indianapolis race weekend moves from mid-June to early August, and the &quot;shared&quot; Circuit of the Americas (COTA) race weekend moves from early November back to early October. The Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix presented by Lear moves from early June to May 31—June 2, just four days after the event at Lime Rock Park ends. The season finale at Daytona International Speedway moves up one week to mid-November.

On the 2019 West Coast Championship schedule, the season is one race longer (6), and opens a couple of weeks earlier at Willows, California&#x27;s Thunderhill Raceway Park. The shared event at Laguna Seca takes place in early May, with Sonoma moving from early June to mid-June, replacing the shared event at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The shared event at Circuit of the Americas (CoTA) moves from early November to early October.

For 2020, the season finale at Daytona was dropped due to unresolvable scheduling conflicts, and after a two-year absence, the race at Brainerd, Minnesota was reinstated to honor the late Jed Copham, the track&#x27;s co-owner and part time Trans Am Series driver. The season&#x27;s grand finale in both series will now be the shared event at Circuit Of The Americas (CoTA), with that race being moved from October to November. The Indianapolis race is the only event that is open to all competitors who are registered to race in the Trans Am Championship series, or either of the regional sub-championship series. In the West Coast Championship series, the season will start one month earlier (mid-March) at Sonoma Raceway, which will for the first time ever also hold a second race in late August to make up for the Auto Club Speedway race being dropped. Other than this and minor reordering, the schedule remains at six races, with Laguna Seca as the other shared event with both series racing together.

On March 17, 2020, the Road Atlanta round was forced to be postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. This was the start of a series of postponements and cancellations that lead to a revised schedule being announced on April 7, 2020. In this schedule, the Detroit round was dropped reducing the series to an 11-round championship. Unfortunately the planned restart of the series at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was also postponed with a new date for the track still to be determined and the series resuming at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course instead. The rounds at Watkins Glen and Lime Rock Park were the final casualties of the outbreak with late cancellations leading to double headers at Virginia International Raceway and Road Atlanta.

In 2021, for the first time since 2017, the series will return to Homestead-Miami Speedway. Trans-Am will also be having its first ever race at the newly renovated Charlotte Motor Speedway Roval and a TA2-only round at the inaugural running of the Music City Grand Prix on the streets of Nashville. No double-headers are scheduled to return following their appearances in 2020; however, all tracks that were featured on the preliminary 2020 calendar are scheduled for 2021 as well. For the first time in series history, Trans-Am instituted a drop-round system where competitors can choose to drop their two worst round results including non-appearances that took place before August 1.

===Car classifications===

====Tube-frame / silhouette body====
=====TA=====

TA class cars are high-performance Grand Touring race cars with a tubular chassis and a Cadillac CTS-V, Chevrolet Camaro (Gen 6), Dodge Challenger (Gen 3), or Ford Mustang (Gen 6) full-scale replica body built by Advanced Composite Products or Derhaag Motorsports. All body types are eligible from the first year of production of the street car to five years after production ends. After each body model&#x27;s full eligibility ends, each body will be partially eligible for an additional five years, and may be used in up to five races per year of eligibility. Cars may use a single-element rear wing. (Older body styles may continue to be used in the West Coast Championship, Northern Regional Cup, and Southern Regional Cup for an additional 10-years after partial-eligibility for the National Championship has ended. Cars using a Trans Am approved body model with bodies from alternate manufacturers that are approved to run in the SCCA Club GT1 class may be approved to run in the West Coast Championship, Northern Regional Cup, or Southern Regional Cup on a case-by-case basis.)

Power comes from overhead valve (two per cylinder), pushrod, naturally aspirated, carbureted (single 4-barrel) 366 cubic inch (5.99 L) V8 engines producing 850+ horsepower. The minimum base weight is 2,780 pounds. Current rules allow for the use of leaded gasoline, whereas all other classes except XGT must use unleaded gas. Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than five forward gear ratios, as well as a functional reverse gear. Sequential shifting transmissions are permitted, as well as commercially available No-Lift Shift (NLS) systems, and also &quot;auto-blip&quot; RPM matching systems for downshifting. Traction Control systems or devices that function independently of the driver are strictly prohibited, as is ABS (Anti-skid Braking System).

===== TA2 =====
TA2 class rules specify a tubular chassis built by Howe Racing Enterprises, Mike Cope Racing, M-1 Motorsports, or Meissen Enterprises, and a Chevrolet Camaro (Gen 5 &amp; 6), Ford Mustang (Gen 5 &amp; 6) or Dodge Challenger (Gen 3) body (full-scale replica) built by either Five Star Racing Race Car Bodies (Gen 6 Camaros / Mustangs), or Howe Racing Enterprises (all other eligible cars). The minimum base weight (including driver and any driver gear) for all cars is 2,830 pounds. The costs of shock absorbers, brake calipers &amp; pads, and wheels are controlled, and no titanium or carbon fiber components are allowed. Only the driver&#x27;s seat and Derhaag single plane rear wing may be constructed using carbon fiber. TA2 is currently Trans Am&#x27;s most popular class among competitors and has been exported internationally to Europe, Asia and Australia.

TA2 engines are similar to TA engines, except that they must be supplied by a Trans Am Approved and Certified Engine Builder/Rebuilder, and use fuel injection rather than a carburetor, as well as a Trans Am certified inlet restrictor plate, as maximum power is limited to 490 HP and 447 lb-ft of torque. Engines must comply with all TA2 engine regulations, and are sealed by the builder/rebuilder. As per current rules, &quot;Nothing may direct or force air to the filter or housing.&quot; Transmissions must be commercially available, &quot;H pattern&quot; manual units with four forward gear ratios (1:1 fourth gear ratio, and no overdrive) and a reverse gear. Sequential shift mechanisms are not allowed, nor are shift-without-lift mechanisms. Traction Control devices or systems that function independently of the driver are strictly prohibited, as is ABS (Anti-skid Braking System).

==== Production based ====
=====XGT=====
New for 2020, the Xtreme Grand Touring (XGT) class will be used for former FIA Group GT3 cars whose homologation has expired under SRO and FIA regulations. During the 2019 Indianapolis Motor Speedway round, an Audi R8 whose GT3 homologation had expired was placed in the SGT class. After Trans Am Series officials and owners of former GT3 cars that could not be raced in a GT3 series following the expiration of the car&#x27;s GT3 homologation had discussions, the series&#x27; officials announced that for the 2020 season, the &quot;Xtreme Grand Touring&quot; class will be part of the series. All original period-correct GT3 specifications will be enforced, and the series intends for 2016 and earlier cars that have had expired homologations to participate.

=====SGT=====

This class is intended to be a place for &quot;... sports cars, grand touring cars, performance coupes, and performance sedans, all with their varying engines and drivetrain layouts...&quot; to race. Unlike GT class cars, the current rules allow them to compete at a higher level of vehicle preparation. Some engines are required to have restrictor plates, for the purpose of equalizing performance. SGT class cars must be of a number of different specified domestic or foreign makes, models, and year of manufacture, from American &quot;muscle cars&quot;, such as Chevy Corvettes and Camaros, Dodge Challengers and Vipers, and Ford Mustangs to European exotics like Aston Martins, Ferraris, Ginettas, Ligiers, McLarens, Mercedes-AMGs, Lamborghinis, Maseratis, Panozes, and Porsches, as well as Asian exotics, such as Acura NSXs. Eligible cars up to fifteen years old will now be able to race in the series, and for five years after that, partially eligible cars will be able to race in up to six races per year of eligibility. Standard body appearance must be maintained, including the OEM grille and badge. Aftermarket or OEM rear wings are allowed. As with GT, Tube frames are not allowed, but roll cages are mandatory. Minimum Vehicle Base Weights may be changed for the same purpose.

=====GT=====

This class complies more with the classic Trans Am standards of &quot;the glory era&quot;, and is the entry-level class of the three production-based classes within the Trans Am Series. &quot;All vehicles must be production based, whether mass-production or limited-production, or a &quot;kit car&quot; that matches the look and performance of the GT class, and is available to the general public&quot; (including &#x27;track specific&#x27; models), such as Ford Mustangs, Chevrolet Camaros, Dodge Vipers, Nissan 350Zs, Porsche Caymans, or Mercedes-AMGs, and many more. The class is intended to be a competition between late model, nearly stock, high-performance cars, and as the introductory level for Trans Am Series beginners to start racing. As with the SGT class, there is a fifteen-year period of full eligibility, and a five-year period of partial eligibility for eligible makes and models where a maximum of six races may be run. OEM rear spoilers/wings may be used. As with SGT, some engines are required to have approved restrictor plates, for the purpose of equalizing performance. Minimum Vehicle Base Weights are adjusted depending on optional components used.

===Championships and awards===
Originally, Manufacturers&#x27; Championship points were awarded in all classes to the top 6 finishing positions of each make of car: 9-6-4-3-2-1. Beginning in 1972, the SCCA instituted a Drivers&#x27; Championship that would be based on overall finishing position from 1st through 10th places: 20-15-12-10-8-6-4-3-2-1. Beginning in 1990, the top 25 finishers were awarded points as follows: 30-27-25-23-21-19-18-17-16-15-14-13-12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-1.

Currently, Manufacturers&#x27; Championship points are earned in exactly the same manner as they were originally. (*Vehicles must be classified as finishers to score Manufacturers&#x27; points.) Final point standings ties will be decided by which manufacturer has more wins, second-place finishes, etc., as necessary to determine the winner.

Series Champions in each of the four competition classes are determined based on points accumulated during the season. Drivers&#x27; Championship points are awarded as follows: At each race, after Qualifying has been completed, 3 points are awarded to the First Qualifier, 2 to the Second Qualifier, and 1 to the Third Qualifier. The top 24 finishers in each class, at each race are awarded points as follows: 30-27-25-23-21-20-19-18-17-16-15-14-13-12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. All other finishers are awarded 1 point, provided the driver is classified as a starter. After the first green flag lap of a race, 1 point is awarded to any driver leading a lap in class, as well as 1 point for leading the most laps in class for each race. &quot;In the event qualifying was not held due to any reason, Drivers Championship points will not be awarded.&quot; (A driver must be classified as a starter to score Championship points.)

The West Coast Championship Series operates just like the national championship. Points earned at shared events only count toward the series that the driver / team is currently entered in. If a race counts toward more than one championship series, a driver wishing to earn points for more than one championship must formally enter each series.

After the results of each race are &quot;final&quot;, the COOLSHIRT Systems &quot;Cool Move of the Race&quot; Award (If applicable, it is given to the outstanding driver of the race, and the &quot;move&quot; could also be a &#x27;move up through the field&#x27;.), pitboxes.com Crew Award, and Traq Gear Crew Chief Award are given out.

Series Champions are awarded the brand new for 2017 Trigon Trophy (sponsored by 3-Dimensional Services Group, and custom designed by longtime partner Crystal Sensations). According to The Trans Am Race Company, LLC President John Claggett, &quot;The base is shaped as a &quot;D&quot;... The crystal is essentially 3 sided... thus... the Trigon Trophy reflects the sponsorship. And yes... They are beautiful.&quot; The Trans Am Series&#x27; traditional colors are red and black, and Pirelli&#x27;s color is yellow, with The Trigon Trophies incorporating those design elements.

2018 introduced the Northern Cup and Southern Cup Regional sub-championships for teams that either do not wish to, or cannot run the entire race schedule, and have run a limited number of races in the past. There are very specific requirements for entry into the regional championships, as they are intended to allow drivers to try competing in the series before committing to running the full schedule of events. A driver / team may earn points in one or both championship series, or either the Northern or Southern Cup sub-championship series, but not in both a sub-championship series and also a championship series.

Also new for 2018 is the Master&#x27;s Championship, which is intended to recognize drivers still actively competing on the racetrack who are over 65 years of age. Again, the points schedule for driver&#x27;s championship points will be used. The highest finishing Master&#x27;s Championship driver in each class will be recognized during the podium ceremony after each race. At the end of the year, the top three Master&#x27;s Championship drivers in each regional series will be recognized at the series awards banquet.

Rookie of the Year winners in each class are also determined by points accumulated during the season.

New for 2018 is the Trans Am Team Championship, with points being awarded to each car/car number. Multiple drivers may compete in the same car / car number in order to earn points towards the Team Championship. The number of points earned follows the same methodology as in the Driver&#x27;s Championship (according to finishing position), but as the rule book states, &quot;In addition to the points earned on-track, teams will be judged by several factors that embody a professional team and help promote, and improve, the Series&quot;.

For the 2021 season, the Trans Am Series in partnership with the Sports Car Club of America created the Pro/Am Challenge. The Pro/Am Challenge allows SCCA drivers to compete in Trans Am using the 2021 SCCA road racing rulebook for their cars, making the transition back and forth between the SCCA Road Racing program and Trans Am much easier. This secondary championship is open to all five Trans Am classes and the primary SCCA classes that fit into these Trans Am classes are GT1, GT2, GTX, T1, T2, T3 and STO. The various cars are balanced into the correct Trans Am class with minor weight and restrictor changes. The Pro/Am Challenge requires competitors to compete in the two specific Pro/Am Challenge rounds and pick four other Trans Am Series or West Coast Trans Am Series races in which they will earn points. Points are awarded using the same system as the main Trans Am Series championship.

*See current rule book for complete information on all Trans Am Series rules and regulations.

==Manufacturers / drivers championships==
===National championship===
NOTE: In 1980, the Sports Car Club of America retroactively named an overall drivers&#x27; championships for all pre-1972 seasons, using the points system of the time to calculate drivers&#x27; championships. The SCCA and the Trans-Am Series now recognise these drivers as series champions. 

===West coast championship===
==Class championships by manufacturer==
==Other series based on the format==
The Trans-Am Series has used tube-frame / silhouette cars, similar to the original IMSA GT Series, since the early 1980s, with heavy emphasis on GT cars. The SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge and Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge racing series, run by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), and the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), respectively, utilize modified production-based cars, sports cars, and touring cars, similar in spirit to the Trans-Am Series since the 1980s. With the rise of these other series, Trans-Am saw decreased attention from the media, however, Speedvision did occasionally cover Trans-Am races.

There are two popular TA2-based racing series in Australia, see Trans-Am racing in Australia.

<doc id="689992" wikidata="Q45207" url="?curid=689992" title="Antonio Inoki">
<text>, born and later Muhammad Hussain Inoki (); February 20, 1943 – October 1, 2022) was a Japanese professional wrestler, professional wrestling trainer, martial artist, politician, and promoter of professional wrestling and mixed martial arts (MMA). He is best known as the founder and 33-year owner of New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). He is considered to be one of the most influential professional wrestlers of all time, and one of the biggest key influences on MMA in Japan and internationally.

After spending his adolescence in Brazil, Inoki began his professional wrestling career in the 1960s for the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA) under the tutelage of Rikidōzan. After he changed his in-ring moniker to Antonio Inoki in 1963, a homage to accomplished Italian wrestler Antonino Rocca, Inoki became one of the most popular stars in Japanese professional wrestling. He is credited with developing strong style and shoot style wrestling in the 1970s and 1980s. He parlayed his wrestling career into becoming one of Japan&#x27;s most recognizable athletes, a reputation bolstered by his 1976 fight against world champion boxer Muhammad Ali – a fight that served as a predecessor to modern day MMA. In 1995, with Ric Flair, Inoki headlined two shows in North Korea that drew 165,000 and 190,000 spectators, the highest attendances in professional wrestling history. Inoki wrestled his retirement match on April 4, 1998 against Don Frye, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2010. Inoki was a twelve-time professional wrestling world champion, notably being the inaugural IWGP Heavyweight Champion and the first Asian WWF Heavyweight Champion (and one of only four overall WWF/WWE Champions of Asian descent, the others being The Iron Sheik, Batista, and Jinder Mahal) – a reign not officially recognized by WWE.

Inoki began his promoting career in 1972, when he founded New Japan Pro-Wrestling. He remained the owner of NJPW until 2005 when he sold his controlling share in the promotion to the Yuke&#x27;s video game company. In 2007, he founded the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF). In 2017, Inoki founded ISM and the following year left IGF. He was also a co-creator of the karate style Kansui-ryū (寛水流, &quot;Kansui-ryū&quot;) along with Matsubayashi-ryū master Yukio Mizutani.

In 1989, while still an active wrestler, Inoki entered politics as he was elected to the Japanese House of Councillors. During his first term with the House of Councillors, Inoki successfully negotiated with Saddam Hussein for the release of Japanese hostages before the outbreak of the Gulf War. His first tenure in the House of Councillors ended in 1995, but he was reelected in 2013. In 2019, Inoki retired from politics.

==Early life==
Kanji Inoki was born into an affluent family in Yokohama on February 20, 1943. He was the sixth son and the second-youngest of the seven boys and four girls. His father, Sajiro Inoki, a businessman and politician, died when Kanji was five years old. Inoki was taught karate by an older brother while in 6th grade. By the time he was in 7th grade at Terao Junior High School, he was 5 feet 11 inches tall and joined the basketball team. He later quit and joined a track and field club as a shot putter. He eventually won the championship at the Yokohama Junior High School track and field competition.

The family fell on hard times in the post-war years, and in 1957, the 14-year-old Inoki emigrated to Brazil with his grandfather, mother, and brothers. His grandfather died during the journey to Brazil. Inoki won regional championships in Brazil in shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw, and finally the All Brazilian championships in the shot put and discus.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1960–1971)===
Inoki met Rikidōzan at the age of 17 in Brazil and went back to Japan for the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA) as his . He trained in the JWA dojo under the renowned Karl Gotch, complementing further his training under amateur wrestler Isao Yoshiwara and kosen judoka Kiyotaka Otsubo. One of his dojo classmates was Giant Baba. After Rikidozan&#x27;s murder, Inoki worked in Baba&#x27;s shadow until he left for an excursion to the United States in 1964.

After a long excursion of wrestling in the United States, Inoki found a new home in Tokyo Pro Wrestling in 1966. While there, Inoki became their biggest star. His first major feud in Japan was against Johnny Valentine, NWA United States Champion in Toronto. Inoki defeated Valentine on December 19, 1966 in Osaka to claim a version of the title. The company folded in January 1967, due to turmoil behind the scenes, and Inoki abandoned the title.

Returning to JWA in late 1967, Inoki was made Baba&#x27;s partner and the two dominated the tag team ranks as the &quot;B-I Cannon&quot;, winning the NWA International Tag Team Championship belts four times.

On May 16, 1969, during the 11th World Big League, Inoki stopped Giant Baba&#x27;s fourth consecutive victory and won his first tournament.

In July 1969, when NET (currently TV Asahi) started broadcasting Japanese professional wrestling, Inoki was the ace of NET&#x27;s wrestling broadcasts, as Baba&#x27;s matches were monopolized by Nippon TV under the agreement between the JWA and Nippon TV. On December 2, 1969, he challenged Dory Funk Jr. for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and on March 26, 1971, won the NWA United National Championship from John Tolos, establishing the title in Japan.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1972–2005)===

Fired from JWA in late 1971 for planning a takeover of the promotion, Inoki founded New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in 1972. His first match as a New Japan wrestler was against Karl Gotch. In 1975 he faced Lou Thesz, with Inoki taking a vicious Greco-Roman backdrop within the first seconds of the match.

In 1976, Inoki fought with Pakistani Akram Pahalwan in a special rules match. The match apparently turned into a shoot, with an uncooperative Akram biting Inoki in the arm and Inoki retaliating with an eye poke. At the end, Inoki won the bout with a double wrist lock, injuring Pahalwan&#x27;s arm after the latter refused to submit. According to referee Mr. Takahashi, this finish was not scripted and was fought for real after the match&#x27;s original flow became undone.

On December 8, 1977, Inoki was involved in a match against former strongman turned professional wrestler Antonio Barichievich better known as The Great Antonio. Barichievich inexplicably began no-selling Inoki&#x27;s attacks and then stiffing Inoki; Inoki responded by shooting on Barichievich, retaliating with a series palm strikes, grounding him with a single leg takedown and following with up repeated kicks, and then stomping his head repeatedly as he lay on the mat before the match was stopped.

In June 1979, Inoki wrestled Akram&#x27;s countryman Zubair Jhara Pahalwan, this time in a regular match, and lost the fight in the fifth round. In 2014, 22 years after Zubair Jhara&#x27;s death, he announced he would take Jhara&#x27;s nephew Haroon Abid under his guardianship.
On November 30, 1979, Inoki defeated WWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund in Tokushima, Japan, to win the championship. Backlund then won a rematch on December 6. However, WWF president Hisashi Shinma declared the re-match a no contest due to interference from Tiger Jeet Singh, and Inoki remained champion. Inoki refused the title on the same day, and it was declared vacant. Backlund later defeated Bobby Duncum in a Texas Death match to regain the title on December 12. Inoki&#x27;s reign is not recognized by WWE in its WWF/WWE title history and Backlund&#x27;s first reign is viewed as uninterrupted from 1978 to 1983.

In 1995, Inoki and the North Korean government came together to hold a two-day wrestling festival for peace in Pyongyang, North Korea. The event drew 165,000 and 190,000 fans respectively to Rungnado May Day Stadium. The main event saw the only match between Inoki and Ric Flair, with Inoki coming out on top. Days before this event, Inoki and the Korean press went to the grave and birthplace of Rikidōzan and paid tribute to him.

Inoki&#x27;s retirement from professional wrestling matches came with the staging of the &quot;Final Countdown&quot; series between 1994 and 1998. This was a special series in which Inoki re-lived some of his martial arts matches under traditional professional wrestling rules, as well as rematches of some of his most well known wrestling matches. As part of the Final Countdown tour, Inoki made a rare World Championship Wrestling appearance; defeating WCW World Television Champion Steven Regal in a non-title match at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVIII&quot;. On April 4, 1998, Inoki defeated Don Frye in the final official match of his professional wrestling career. After his retirement in 1998, Inoki founded a new wrestling promotion, the Universal Fighting-Arts Organization (UFO).

Inoki would later participate in four exhibition matches after his retirement. On March 11, 2000, at a Rikidōzan memorial event, Inoki was defeated by Japanese actor and singer Hideaki Takizawa; later that year during a New Year&#x27;s Eve event, he wrestled Brazilian mixed martial artist Renzo Gracie to a time limit draw. On December 31, 2001, he teamed with The Great Sasuke to defeat Giant Silva and Red &amp; White Mask; two years later, on December 31, 2003, Inoki wrestled the final match of his career, facing Tatsumi Fujinami as part of Fujinami&#x27;s retirement ceremony.

In 2005, Yuke&#x27;s, a Japanese video company, purchased Inoki&#x27;s controlling 51.5% stock in New Japan.

===Post NJPW years (2005–2022)===
In 2007, Inoki founded a new promotion called Inoki Genome Federation (IGF).

On February 1, 2010, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) announced on its Japanese website that Inoki would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Inoki was presented with a Hall of Fame certificate by WWE&#x27;s Ed Wells.

In 2017, Inoki created a new company, ISM. ISM held its first event on June 24 of that year. On March 23, 2018, Inoki left IGF.

In October 2019, Inoki appeared at a Pro Wrestling Zero1 event at the Yasukuni Shrine, which is controversial for its relation to World War II.

In August 2022, Inoki established the Inoki Genki Factory to serve as his official management company. It was later reported that the Inoki Genki Factory was looking into the idea of hosting professional wrestling and mixed martial arts events.

==Political career==
===House of Councillors===
====1989–1995: First stint====
Following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Inoki entered politics in 1989, when he was elected into the House of Councillors as a representative of his own Sports and Peace Party in the 1989 Japanese House of Councillors election. Inoki&#x27;s win secured him among the highest offices ever won by a professional wrestling personality in politics. The Sports and Peace Party later formed a parliamentary alliance with the Democratic Socialist Party. On October 14, 1989, Inoki was stabbed during a political event in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima Prefecture.

Imitating Muhammad Ali, Inoki traveled to Iraq in 1990 in &quot;an unofficial one-man diplomatic mission&quot; to negotiate with Saddam Hussein for the release of Japanese hostages before the outbreak of the Gulf War. He personally organized a wrestling event in Iraq to entice Saddam to free the 41 captive Japanese nationals, this ultimately proved to be a success with 36 Japanese nationals freed. Inoki subsequently retained his seat in the 1992 Japanese House of Councillors election. He failed to win re-election in the 1995 Japanese House of Councillors election following a number of scandals reported in 1994, and left politics for the next eighteen years.

====2013–2019: Second stint====

On June 5, 2013, Inoki announced that he would again run for a House of Councillors seat in the National Diet under the Japan Restoration Party ticket. Inoki won the election to return to Japan&#x27;s Upper House as an MP.

In November 2013, he was suspended from the Diet for 30 days because of an unauthorized trip to North Korea. He had visited on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the armistice in the Korean War, and had met with senior North Korean figure Kim Yong-nam during his visit. This was Inoki&#x27;s 27th visit to North Korea; he explained in an interview that the North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens had caused the Japanese government to &quot;close the door&quot; on diplomacy with the North, but that the issue would not be resolved without ongoing communication, and that he saw his relationship with North Korean-born Rikidōzan as a crucial link to the people of the North.

He was reportedly considering running for governor of Tokyo in 2014 following another visit to North Korea.

Inoki joined the splinter of the Japan Restoration Party, Party for Future Generations, in 2014. In January 2015, he helped to establish a new party named the Assembly to Energize Japan, which he left in 2016, to sit in the Independents Club.

In September 2017, Inoki re-established his position that Japan should make more of an effort to have co-operative dialogue with North Korea, in the wake of North Korea launching ballistic missiles over Hokkaido. This was succeeded by another of Inoki&#x27;s controversial trips to the nation.

In June 2019, Inoki announced his retirement from politics.

===Other positions===
On June 23, 1989, Inoki founded the Sports and Peace Party, his own political party. Inoki served as the party&#x27;s leader until the 1998 House of Councillors election when he was succeeded by Iichi Nishime. In 2002, Inoki was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of Palau; Inoki would again be appointed a Japanese Goodwill Ambassador to Palau in 2013.

From August 2014 until December 2014, Inoki served as the director of the National Sports Bureau of the Party for Future Generations and as a chairperson of the Policy Research Committee of the House of Councillors. On March 1, 2015, Inoki was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the 2016 Summer Olympics by the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia. From 2015 until 2016, Inoki served as the supreme advisor of the Assembly to Energize Japan, a political party he co-founded with Kota Matsuda.

==Mixed martial arts involvement==

Inoki was amongst the group of professional wrestlers who were tutored in the art of hooking and shooting by the professional wrestler Karl Gotch. This method of wrestling taught to Inoki by Gotch borrowed heavily from professional wrestling&#x27;s original catch wrestling roots, and is one of the most important influences of modern shoot wrestling. Inoki named his method of fighting &quot;strong style&quot; and it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Inokiism&quot;.

Inoki faced many opponents from all dominant disciplines of combat from various parts of the world, such as boxers, judoka, karateka, kung fu practitioners, sumo wrestlers, and fellow professional wrestlers. These bouts included a match with then-prominent karate competitor Everett Eddy. Eddy had previously competed in a mixed skills bout against boxer Horst Geisler and lost by knockout. The bout with Eddy ended with the karateka knocked out by a professional wrestling powerbomb followed by a Hulk Hogan-esque leg drop. Another such match pitted Inoki against 6&#x27;7&quot; Kyokushin karate stylist Willie Williams, who had allegedly fought a bear for a 1976 Japanese film titled &quot;The Strongest Karate 2&quot;. This bout ended when a doctor stopped the fight after both competitors repeatedly fell out of the ring. Although many of the matches were predetermined and scripted, they are seen as a precursor to modern mixed martial arts (MMA). When asked about Inoki&#x27;s fighting skills, business colleague Carlson Gracie stated Inoki was &quot;one of the best fighters he&#x27;d seen.&quot;

His most famous bout was against heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali on June 26, 1976, in Tokyo. Inoki initially promised Ali a predetermined match to get him to fight in Japan, but when the deal materialized, Ali&#x27;s camp feared that Inoki would turn the fight into a shoot, which many believe was Inoki&#x27;s intention. Ali visited a professional wrestling match involving Inoki and witnessed Inoki&#x27;s grappling ability. The rules of the match were announced several months in advance. Two days before the match, however, several new rules were added which severely limited the moves that each man could perform. One rule change, specifying that Inoki could only throw a kick if one of his knees was on the ground, had a major effect on the outcome of the fight. Ali landed a total of six punches to Inoki, and Inoki kept to his back in a defensive position for almost the entire duration of the match of 15 rounds, hitting Ali with a low kick repeatedly. The bout ended in a draw, 3–3. Ali left without a press conference and suffered damage to his legs as a result of Inoki&#x27;s repeated kicks.

Following his retirement from professional wrestling, Inoki promoted a number of MMA events such as UFO Legend, NJPW Ultimate Crush (which showcased pro wrestling matches and MMA matches on the same card), and the annual Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye shows which took place on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. Some of the major attractions of these events involved the best of NJPW against world-renowned fighters in legitimate MMA matches. Inoki faced mixed martial artist Renzo Gracie in an exhibition match at the 2000 Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye.

On August 28, 2002, Inoki participated in the Shockwave event co-promoted by K-1 and the Pride Fighting Championships; with a reported attendance of 91,107, Shockwave remains the highest attended live event in MMA&#x27;s history. The event&#x27;s opening ceremony saw Inoki dropping into the National Stadium by parachute and then being joined by Hélio Gracie. After being dubbed the &quot;founding fathers of MMA&quot;, the two lit a ceremonial Olympic Torch together.

Future UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Lyoto Machida began his career in MMA under the management of Inoki. Machida was described by Inoki as a symbolic &quot;successor&quot; figure for himself, as Naoya Ogawa and Kazuyuki Fujita had been in the past. In 2003, Inoki co-founded the Brazilian MMA promotion Jungle Fight with Wallid Ismail. Inoki was also the ambassador for the International Fight League&#x27;s Tokyo entry before that promotion&#x27;s demise. Additionally, Inoki&#x27;s Inoki Genome Federation promoted both professional wrestling matches and mixed martial arts fights.

==Personal life==
Inoki had 10 siblings. His brother Juichi Sagara was a karate master and is credited with bringing Shōtōkan to Brazil. Inoki&#x27;s brother Pablo Inoki, a tenor and political activist, once led the Inoki-founded Sports and Peace Party.

Inoki married American woman Diana Tuck (also known as Linda Tuck) in 1965. The couple would have a daughter together, but separated two years later. Inoki&#x27;s daughter later died at age 8. Inoki was married to actress Mitsuko Baisho from 1971 to 1987, and together they had a daughter, Hiroko. Inoki married for a third time in 1989, with his third wife giving birth to Inoki&#x27;s first son. The couple divorced in 2012. Inoki&#x27;s son later attended Columbia University in New York City. In 2014, Inoki took Haroon Abid, nephew of his Pakistani rival Zubair Jhara Pahalwan, under his guardianship. Inoki&#x27;s fourth wife, Tazuko Tada, died on August 27, 2019. Inoki has two grandsons, Hirota and Naoto Inoki. Hirota was a swimmer at Santa Monica College, having previously set school records in swimming at El Segundo High School. In June 2023, Hirota was appointed to the board of directors of the Inoki Genki Factory. In January 2024, it was reported that Naoto was training in professional wrestling under Katsuyori Shibata, having previously trained under the staff of the L.A. Inoki Dojo. Naoto additionally trains in mixed martial arts (MMA) at Black House MMA. On July 20, 2024, Naoto made his professional wrestling debut, defeating Casanova at a Backyard Squabbles event.

Inoki converted to Shia Islam in 1990 during a pilgrimage to Karbala, the Shiite holy city in Iraq. He was in Iraq negotiating for the release of several Japanese hostages. While in Iraq, Inoki was bestowed the Islamic moniker Muhammad Hussain Inoki (), later reportedly describing himself as both a Muslim convert and a Buddhist. In 2014, Inoki said he was &quot;usually a Buddhist&quot;.

Inoki operated a wrestling themed restaurant in Shinjuku, Tokyo, named Antonio&#x27;s Inoki Sakaba Shinjuku. Inoki is the namesake of two islands, the Inoki Friendship Island in Cuba and the Inoki Island in Palau. In 2021, it was reported that spinal issues had confined Inoki to a wheelchair.

== Death and legacy ==
On October 1, 2022 (September 30 in Eastern Time), at age 79, Inoki died from systemic transthyretin amyloidosis.

American professional wrestling promotion WWE paid tribute to Inoki on the September 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. On October 1, at Royal Quest II in London, England, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) held a ten-bell salute for Inoki. Numerous other Japanese promotions would additionally hold ten-bell salutes for Inoki in the weeks and months following his death. NPB team Yokohama DeNA BayStars would play Inoki&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Inoki Bombaye&quot; (itself a remix of &quot;Ali Bombaye (Zaire Chant) I&quot; from Muhammad Ali&#x27;s 1977 biographical film), at their games as a tribute to Inoki following his death.

On October 4, NJPW announced that they had made Inoki the promotion&#x27;s Honorary Chairman for Life prior to his passing. On October 10, during Declaration of Power, the first NJPW event held in Japan since Inoki&#x27;s death, the promotion held a second ten-bell salute for Inoki.

On December 28, Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye x Ganryujima, a memorial show honoring Inoki, was organized by the Inoki Genki Factory in collaboration with Samurai Warriors Ganryujima and NJPW. Three days later, on December 31, mixed martial arts promotion Rizin held their Rizin 40 event as a memorial for Inoki. On January 4, 2023, NJPW held their Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in tribute to Inoki. On June 9, NJPW, All Japan Pro Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling Noah held All Together: Again to celebrate Inoki&#x27;s legacy.

On January 16, 2023, Inoki was posthumously awarded the Order of the Rising Sun by the Government of Japan. On that same day, it was announced that Inoki had been awarded the Junior Fourth Rank in Japan&#x27;s &quot;ikai&quot; court ranks system. On June 9, the Japan Anniversary Association declared October 1 to be Antonio Inoki Fighting Spirit Day. On September 9, a statue of Inoki was unveiled at the Sojiji Temple in Yokohama.

America&#x27;s All Elite Wrestling held an event on October 1, 2023, the one-year anniversary of Inoki&#x27;s death, titled WrestleDream that was organized in honor of Inoki. WrestleDream has since been established as an annual event held by AEW in tribute to Inoki.

On December 14, 2024, the Antonio Inoki Memorial Show was organized in Shanghai, China by NJPW and various Asia-Pacific Federation of Wrestling promotions.

Two of Inoki&#x27;s former students, Durango Kid and Laberinto, currently run a &quot;lucha libre&quot; promotion that bears his name, Inoki Sports Management. The two also serve as the head trainers of a wrestling school named the L.A. Inoki Dojo.

==In media==
A character based on Inoki called &quot;Kanji Igari&quot; appears in the Japanese manga series &quot;Baki the Grappler&quot; by Keisuke Itagaki.

Inoki appears in the manga &quot;Tiger Mask&quot;, in a secondary role: he is the only one who was able to win over Naoto &quot;Tiger Mask&quot; Date, with the two subsequently becoming best friends.

Under the names &quot;Kanta Inokuma&quot; and &quot;Armand Inokuma&quot;, Inoki appears in the manga &quot;Rasputin the Patriot&quot; by Takashi Nagasaki and Junji Itō, a manga heavily based on the book &quot;Trap of the State&quot; written by ex-diplomat and political writer Masaru Satō. This manga reveals Inoki&#x27;s experience when he visited Russia to meet with vice president of the Soviet Union Gennady Yanayev in May 1991, three months before the Soviet coup attempt. According to the manga, Inoki correctly predicted that Yanayev would be the one to lead the coup d&#x27;état attempt in August.

Inoki appeared in the film &quot;The Bad News Bears Go to Japan&quot; as himself. A subplot in his scenes involved Inoki seeking a rematch with Ali. Gene LeBell, who also appears in these scenes as a manager of Inoki&#x27;s scheduled opponent, Mean Bones Beaudine, was the referee of Inoki&#x27;s match with Ali. Inoki&#x27;s appearance in the film culminates with a match against the main character, Marvin Lazar (played by Tony Curtis), when Beaudine suddenly becomes unavailable to participate. Professional wrestler Héctor Guerrero served as Curtis&#x27;s stunt double for the wrestling portions of this scene.

Inoki had the starring role in the film &quot;Acacia&quot; directed by Jinsei Tsuji.

In Oh!Great&#x27;s manga &quot;Air Gear&quot;, Inoki is regularly referred to by the author, and by the manga&#x27;s characters as an influence on their fighting style. The manga also makes several references to Inoki&#x27;s large chin. Along with Inoki, fellow wrestler Steve Austin of the World Wrestling Federation has been referred to in &quot;Air Gear&quot;″s pages.

Inoki made an appearance as the guest in 2005 &quot;Doraemon&quot; episode &quot;The Pitch-Black Pop Stars&quot;, where he wrestled Gian after he splashed ink on his face.

Inoki is the inspiration for the wrestling legend Iron Kiba, from the manga &quot;Koukou Tekkenden Tough&quot;.

Several episodes of the Japanese comedy show &quot;Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!&quot;, most notably 2007&#x27;s &quot;Do Not Laugh at the Hospital&quot; and 2009&#x27;s &quot;Do Not Laugh as a Hotel Man&quot;, have included parodies of Inoki. In the former, three &quot;patients&quot; are presented as being Inoki, with each imitating Inoki&#x27;s in-ring persona; while in the latter, the guest known only as &quot;Shin Onii&quot; was asked to imitate Inoki as if he were a hotel bellhop.

In May 2021, Inoki appeared on the Vice on TV series &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot; in an episode covering the 1995 Collision in Korea event.

In 2023, Inoki was the subject of a documentary film, &quot;Looking for Antonio Inoki&quot;.

<doc id="689993" wikidata="Q1203550" url="?curid=689993" title="Khaosan Road">
<text>Khaosan Road or Khao San Road (, , ) is a short, long street in central Bangkok, Thailand constructed in 1892 during the reign of Rama V. It is in the Bang Lamphu area of Phra Nakhon District about north of the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew.

==Background==

&quot;Khaosan&quot; translates as &#x27;milled rice&#x27;, an indication that in former times the street was a major Bangkok rice market. However, according to historical documentary evidence from the time the road was first completed in the reign of Rama V, it was found that no one living here worked in the rice trade. Therefore, it is assumed that the rice trade probably began in the early Rattanakosin period, which is during the reigns of Rama I to Rama III. In the last 40 years, however, Khaosan Road has developed into a world-famous &quot;backpacker ghetto&quot;. It offers cheap accommodation, ranging from &quot;mattress in a box&quot;-style hotels to reasonably priced three-star hotels. In an essay on the backpacker culture of Khaosan Road, Susan Orlean called it &quot;the place to disappear.&quot; According to the Khao San Business Association, the road sees 40,000–50,000 tourists per day in the high season, and 20,000 per day in the low season.

Visitors to Khao San Road are diverse:

It is also a base of travel: coaches leave daily for all major tourist destinations in Thailand, from Chiang Mai in the north to 
Ko Pha-ngan in the south, and there are many relatively inexpensive travel agents who can arrange visas and transportation to the neighbouring countries of Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and Vietnam.

Khaosan shops sell handicrafts, paintings, clothes, local fruits, unlicensed CDs, DVDs, a wide range of fake IDs, used books, and other useful backpacker items. After dark, bars open, music is played, food hawkers sell barbecued insects and other exotic snacks for tourists, and touts promote ping pong shows.

The area is internationally known as a center of dancing, partying, and just prior to the traditional Thai New Year (Songkran festival) of 13–15 April, water splashing that usually turns into a huge water fight. One Thai writer has described Khaosan as &quot;...a short road that has the longest dream in the world&quot;.

A Buddhist temple under royal patronage, the centuries-old Wat Chana Songkram, is directly opposite Khaosan Road to the west, while the area to the northwest contains an Islamic community and several small mosques.

==History==
According to those who have lived in Bang Lamphu for a long time, the first guest house on Khaosan Road opened around 1982 in a narrow &quot;trok&quot; (alley) connecting to Ratchadamnoen Avenue.

Back then, Khaosan Road was very quiet. Both sides of the street were small shophouses, consisting of beef noodle shop, some were grocery stores, Thai fabric shops, 3–4 illegal snooker clubs where the clientele was mostly teens. In terms of housing, some were old houses of the gentry.

In July 2018, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), in an attempt to clean up Khaosan Road, announced that street vendors would be removed from the thoroughfare from 1 August 2018. The BMA intends to move them to a nearby area and restrict their trading hours to 18:00 to midnight. The Khaosan Street Vendors Association, representing some 300 vendors, rejected the move, citing financial ruin for vendors. Last-minute negotiations between the BMA and vendors proved fruitless as neither side has been willing to compromise. Khaosan vendors announced that, in defiance of BMA order, they will open as usual on 1 August. On the first day of the ban on stalls, roughly 70 percent of the vendors opened as usual in defiance of the police.

===2019 facelift===
The BMA announced in 2019 that it will commit 48.8 million baht to transform Khaosan Road into an &quot;international walking street&quot;. The US$1.6 million project, the first makeover of the road since its creation in 1892, will commence in October 2019, continue through the tourist high-season, and be completed by February 2020. The project will repave footpaths and create designated 1.5 m x 2 m spaces for 240–360 licensed Thai vendors . Vehicles will be prohibited on Khaosan Road from 09:00–21:00 daily.

* Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down on alcohol use
* Time is spent obtaining alcohol or recovering from effects
* Social, occupational and recreational pursuits are given up or reduced because of alcohol use
* Use is continued despite knowledge of alcohol-related harm (physical or psychological)

==== Other alcohol-related disorders ====
Because only 3 of the 7 DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence are required, not all patients meet the same criteria and therefore not all have the same symptoms and problems related to drinking. Not everyone with alcohol dependence, therefore, experiences physiological dependence. Alcohol dependence is differentiated from alcohol abuse by the presence of symptoms such as tolerance and withdrawal. Both alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse are sometimes referred to by the less specific term alcoholism. However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two major differences between alcohol dependence and alcoholism as generally accepted by the medical community.

# Alcohol dependence refers to an entity in which only alcohol is the involved addictive agent. Alcoholism refers to an entity in which alcohol or any cross-tolerant addictive agent is involved.
# In alcohol dependence, reduction of alcohol, as defined within DSM-IV, can be attained by learning to control the use of alcohol. That is, a client can be offered a social learning approach that helps them to &#x27;cope&#x27; with external pressures by re-learning their pattern of drinking alcohol. In alcoholism, patients are generally not presumed to be &#x27;in remission&#x27; unless they are abstinent from alcohol.

The following elements are the template for which the degree of dependence is judged:

# Narrowing of the drinking repertoire.
# Increased salience of the need for alcohol over competing needs and responsibilities.
# An acquired tolerance to alcohol.
# Withdrawal symptoms.
# Relief or avoidance of withdrawal symptoms by further drinking.
# Subjective awareness of compulsion to drink.
# Reinstatement after abstinence.

=== Screening ===
AUDIT has replaced older screening tools such as CAGE but there are many shorter alcohol screening tools, mostly derived from the AUDIT. The Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SAD-Q) is a more specific twenty-item inventory for assessing the presence and severity of alcohol dependence.

==== AUDIT ====
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is considered the most accurate alcohol screening tool for identifying potential alcohol misuse, including dependence. It was developed by the World Health Organization, designed initially for use in primary healthcare settings with supporting guidance.

==== CAGE ====
The CAGE questionnaire, the name of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used method of screening for alcohol dependence.

* Online version of the CAGE questionnaire

==== SADQ ====
The Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ or SAD-Q) is a 20 item clinical screening tool designed to measure the presence and level of alcohol dependence.

== Withdrawal ==
Withdrawals from alcohol dependence is a common side effect that occurs when a person with the dependency stops drinking abruptly or even cuts back on their drinking after a prolonged period of indulgence. Withdrawal from alcohol dependence can vary from mild, moderate to severe, depending on several factors such as: how long the person has been drinking, whether they are a binge drinker, whether they relapse chronically, and how much they drink daily. All these factors can vary from one person to the next depending on psychological, environmental, and biological factors. Some common withdrawal side effects are as listed:

=== Mild ===
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rapid heartbeat
* Elevated blood pressure
* Fatigue
* Body aches / tremors
* Anxiety / Irritability / Depression
* Fuzzy brain
* Issues with sleeping

=== Severe ===
* Vomiting
* Hypertensive crisis
* Seizures / Tremors
* Delusions / Hallucinations
* Dehydration
* Fever
* Chills / Shakes
* Extreme mood lability
* Mental pandemonium
* Little to no appetite

The spectrum of alcohol withdrawal symptoms range from such minor symptoms as insomnia and tremulousness to severe complications such as withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be very tricky to diagnose, due to other preliminary conditions that may exist from individual to individual.

== Treatment ==
Treatments for alcohol dependence can be separated into two groups, those directed towards severely alcohol-dependent people, and those focused for those at risk of becoming dependent on alcohol. Treatment for alcohol dependence often involves utilizing relapse prevention, support groups, psychotherapy, and setting short-term goals. The Twelve-Step Program is also a popular faith-based process used by those wishing to recover from alcohol dependence.

The ultimate goal when it comes to treating alcohol dependence or as the DSM-5 now calls it alcohol use disorder, is to help with establishing abstinence from drinking. There are several other benefits that come along with treatment. For some, it is reconnecting with themselves and obtaining self-esteem and confidence, a healthier lifestyle (physically and mentally), creating new relationships with other like-minded people as well as rekindling or mending old relationships if possible. The treatment process consists typically of two parts short-term and long-term. First, there is the path to abstinence and/or recovery. There are several reasons why someone with alcohol use disorder or alcohol dependency would seek treatment. This can either be a personal reason or because of law enforcement. There is a series of different levels of treatment processes depending on the severity subtype. Some would or could benefit from medication treatment with psychosocial treatment, while others could just benefit from psychosocial treatment. Listed below are some different types of treatments that are used with treating alcohol dependency/alcohol use disorder depending on several factors that vary from person to person.

Types of treatments:

* Withdrawals (no medication aid needed)
* Withdrawals (depending on severity of symptoms, could be accompanied with supervision by medical personal and medication)
* Psychosocial treatment (counseling, CBT, psychoeducation, assertive community treatment)
* Alcoholics Anonymous
* Inpatient or outpatient programs
* Social services (case management)
* Al-Anon/Alateen
* Acceptance and mindfulness-based interventions 

Acceptance and mindfulness-based interventions show evidence of efficacy in being used to target Alcohol Use Disorder. These types of interventions are often most effectively delivered in group settings, however, they are also proven effective in individual therapy contexts. Overall, this is crucial in helping individuals who are dependent on alcohol because it raises awareness, provides a non-judgemental environment for people to express their thoughts, and allows individuals to be heard and accepted in the present moment. 

== Epidemiology ==

About 12% of American adults have had an alcohol dependence problem at some time in their life. In the UK the NHS estimates that around 9% of men and 4% of UK women show signs of alcohol dependence.

==Genetic factors==
A 2015 study found that alcohol dependency may have genetic risk factors. Linkage disequilibrium between an AD-associated GABA receptor gene cluster, GABRB3/GABRG3, and eye color genes, OCA2/HERC2, as well as between AD-associated GRM5 and pigmentation-associated TYR, were all associated with alcohol dependency. GABA downregulation may decrease sensitivity to the toxic effects of alcohol, leading to increased alcohol consumption in blue-eyed individuals.

== History ==
The term &#x27;alcohol dependence&#x27; has replaced &#x27;alcoholism&#x27; as a term in order that individuals do not internalize the idea of cure and disease, but can approach alcohol as a chemical they may depend upon to cope with outside pressures.

The contemporary definition of alcohol dependence is still based upon early research. There has been considerable scientific effort over the past several decades to identify and understand the core features of alcohol dependence. This work began in 1976, when the British psychiatrist Griffith Edwards and his American colleague Milton M. Gross collaborated to produce a formulation of what had previously been understood as &#x27;alcoholism&#x27; – the &quot;alcohol dependence syndrome&quot;.

The alcohol dependence syndrome was seen as a cluster of seven elements that concur. It was argued that not all elements may be present in every case, but the picture is sufficiently regular and coherent to permit clinical recognition. The syndrome was also considered to exist in degrees of severity rather than as a categorical absolute. Thus, the proper question is not &#x27;whether a person is dependent on alcohol&#x27;, but &#x27;how far along the path of dependence has a person progressed&#x27;.

<doc id="690007" wikidata="Q743229" url="?curid=690007" title="Johnny Burke (lyricist)">
<text>John Francis Burke (October 3, 1908 – February 25, 1964) was an American lyricist, successful and prolific between the 1920s and 1950s. His work is considered part of the Great American Songbook.

His song &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot;, from the Bing Crosby film &quot;Going My Way&quot;, won an Academy Award for Best Song in 1944.

==Early life==
Burke was born in Antioch, California, United States, the son of Mary Agnes (Mungovan), a schoolteacher, and William Earl Burke, a structural engineer. When he was still young, his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where Burke&#x27;s father founded a construction business. As a youth, Burke studied piano and drama. He attended Crane College and then the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he played piano in the orchestra.

After graduating from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1927, Burke joined the Chicago office of the Irving Berlin Publishing Company in 1926 as a pianist and song salesman. He also played piano in dance bands and vaudeville.

==Career==
===Burke and Spina===
Irving Berlin Publishing transferred Burke to its New York City office, where he began to write lyrics in collaboration with composer Harold Spina. In 1932, they wrote &quot;Shadows on the Swanee&quot;, followed in 1933 by &quot;Annie Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;, their first big hit for the Guy Lombardo Orchestra. In 1934, Burke and Spina wrote &quot;You&#x27;re Not the Only Oyster in the Stew&quot;, which was a novelty hit for Fats Waller, as was &quot;My Very Good Friend, the Milkman&quot;. Burke and Spina wrote many songs that were played by leading bands of the day, including those led by Ben Pollack, Paul Whiteman and Ozzie Nelson. The Burke - Spina partnership ended in 1936 when Burke left for Hollywood.

=== Burke in Hollywood ===
Burke&#x27;s first partner in Hollywood was Arthur Johnston. He then worked with Jimmy Monaco, but he was to make his mark in collaboration with Jimmy Van Heusen. The team of Burke and Van Heusen turned out some of the great hit tunes of the 1940s. Burke signed a contract with Paramount in 1939, and spent his entire career with the same studio. Burke&#x27;s primary function as a lyricist was working on the films of Bing Crosby. Of the 41 films on which he worked, 25 starred Bing Crosby. Seventeen songs were substantial hits, including &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Pocketful of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Only Forever&quot;, &quot;Moonlight Becomes You&quot; and &quot;Sunday, Monday, or Always&quot;.

Another Burke-Van Heusen song that Crosby recorded was &quot;Sunshine Cake&quot;, which Crosby also sang with Clarence Muse and Coleen Gray in Frank Capra&#x27;s 1950 Paramount film &quot;Riding High&quot;. The song was also recorded by Peggy Lee, Jo Stafford and Dick Haymes, and later Tiny Tim. Other Burke-Van Heusen songs Crosby performed in &quot;Riding High&quot; included &quot;A Sure Thing&quot;, &quot;Someplace on Anywhere Road&quot;, and &quot;The Horse Told Me&quot;.

==Other works==
In 1939, Burke wrote the lyrics for &quot;Scatterbrain&quot;, with music by Frankie Masters and &quot;What&#x27;s New?&quot; with Bob Haggart. In 1955, Burke added lyrics to a standard by jazz pianist Erroll Garner entitled &quot;Misty&quot;. Burke also wrote the words and music to the Nat King Cole song &quot;If Love Ain&#x27;t There&quot;.

The film &quot;The Vagabond King&quot; (1956) was Burke&#x27;s last Hollywood work. In 1961, Burke both composed the music and wrote the lyrics for the Broadway musical &quot;Donnybrook!&quot;, which was based on the 1952 film &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;. The show opened May 18, ran for 68 performances (plus two previews), and closed on July 15.

==Death==

In February 1964, Burke died in New York City from a heart attack at the age of 55.

==Awards and honors==
Burke and Van Heusen&#x27;s song &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot;, from the Bing Crosby film &quot;Going My Way&quot;, won an Academy Award for Best Song in 1944, one of seven Academy Awards won by the film. Burke was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

In 1995, Burke&#x27;s life was depicted in the Broadway musical revue, &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot;.

==Personal life==
Burke was married four times. He was married to Mary Mason in the 1960s, who played Liesl in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; on Broadway. He was married to Bess Patterson from 1939 to 1955; the marriage produced three children.

<text>Jack Morris Rosenthal (8 September 1931 – 29 May 2004) was an English playwright. He wrote 129 early episodes of the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and over 150 screenplays, including original television plays, feature films, and adaptations.

==Early life==
Jack Morris Rosenthal was born into a Jewish family on 8 September 1931, in Cheetham, Manchester. He was the younger of two sons to father Sam, a raincoat factory worker, and mother Leah (née Miller) Rosenthal. His parents were married in 1927 in Manchester, and were children of Russian Jewish immigrants. 

Rosenthal attended the Manchester Jews School in Derby Street, Cheetham. During the Second World War, he was evacuated to Blackpool, Lancashire with an inhospitable family who censored his letters and confiscated his food parcels. His family subsequently moved to Colne, Lancashire, and Rosenthal attended Colne Grammar School. In 1953, after studying English Literature at Sheffield University, he carried out his national service in the Royal Navy as a Russian translator.

== Career ==
Rosenthal worked briefly in advertising before joining Granada Television in 1956. He earned his first television credit with Granada in 1961, assigned as a writer of episode 31 of what would become Britain&#x27;s longest-running soap opera, &quot;Coronation Street.&quot; Rosenthal became a regular writer for the series and, in addition, began writing for other series. During the 1960s, he contributed material for various television comedy shows, including the satirical &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;. At Granada Television, he wrote a &quot;Coronation Street&quot; spin-off series for the character Leonard Swindley, played by Arthur Lowe, called &quot;Pardon the Expression&quot;. Rosenthal also created two comedy series, &quot;The Dustbinmen&quot; and &quot;The Lovers&quot;, the latter starring Richard Beckinsale and Paula Wilcox. In 1976, he wrote a drama for ITV, &quot;Ready When You Are, Mr McGill&quot;, which was remade in 2003.

Rosenthal won three BAFTA awards for &quot;Bar Mitzvah Boy&quot; (about a Jewish boy&#x27;s bar mitzvah), &quot;The Evacuees&quot; (based on his own war-time evacuation) and &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend&quot; (about the football pools winner, Viv Nicholson, directed by John Goldschmidt). He also wrote &quot;The Knowledge&quot;, a film about London taxi-drivers which has become a classic for cabbies-in-training. He wrote the 1986 television film &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; for London Weekend Television, which proved so successful that it was adapted into a television series of the same name, which ran from 1988 until 2002. Rosenthal adapted the novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Lieutenant&quot; for director John Goldschmidt as a mini-series for Channel 4 and ZDF. He also wrote the screenplay for the 1998 &quot;Captain Jack&quot; (based on a true story) for Goldschmidt as producer.

In 1983, Rosenthal co-wrote the film &quot;Yentl&quot; with Barbra Streisand. He also did uncredited work on the screenplay of &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, and wrote the book for the musical version of &quot;Bar Mitzvah Boy&quot;, with music by Jule Styne.

==Personal life and death==
On 23 February 1964, Rosenthal married model Catherine Ward in Blackpool, Lancashire; two years later, the marriage ended in divorce. Rosenthal met actress Maureen Lipman in 1969 in a pub in Manchester while Rosenthal was writing for &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. He married Lipman on 18 February 1973 in Marylebone, London; they had two children, writers Amy and Adam Rosenthal, and lived in a large house in Muswell Hill, north London.

Rosenthal was a lifelong Manchester United fan, listing his recreations in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; as &quot;checking Manchester United&#x27;s score, minute by minute, on teletext&quot;.

In 2002, Rosenthal was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. He died on 29 May 2004 at the North London Hospice in Barnet, north London, aged 72. He is buried in Golders Green Jewish Cemetery. Rosenthal&#x27;s estate was valued at £1.3 million; he left a legacy to The Ravenswood Foundation, West London Synagogue, Jewish Care, Manchester Jewish Museum, Nightingale House and the North London Hospice.

== Honours ==
Rosenthal was appointed CBE in 1994, for services to drama. He received four honorary degrees from northern universities including an honorary doctorate from Sheffield University in 1998 and a degree from Manchester Metropolitan University in 2002.

== Legacy ==
Rosenthal&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;By Jack Rosenthal&quot;, was published posthumously, and a four-part adaptation by his daughter, titled &quot;Jack Rosenthal&#x27;s Last Act&quot; was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in July 2006, starring Maureen Lipman as herself and Stephen Mangan as Rosenthal.

As part of the regeneration of the First Street district in Manchester, a street was named after him, Jack Rosenthal Street, unveiled by his widow in May 2015, next to HOME, a centre of contemporary art, theatre and film.

<doc id="690027" wikidata="Q5335296" url="?curid=690027" title="Ed Pulaski">
<text>Edward Crockett Pulaski (February 9, 1866 – February 2, 1931) was a U.S. Forest Service ranger based in Wallace, Idaho. Pulaski traveled west and worked as a miner, railroad worker, and ranch foreman before joining the forest service in 1908. He was reputed to be, and personally claimed that he was, a collateral descendant of Casimir Pulaski.

==Great Fire of 1910==
On August 20, 1910, Pulaski was credited with saving all but five of his 45-man crew during what is known as the &quot;Great Idaho Fire,&quot; the &quot;Great Fire of 1910&quot; or the &quot;Big Blowup.&quot; It had been unusually dry in 1910 and forest fires were rampant across the northern Rockies. Pulaski was supervising crews on the west fork of Placer Creek, about five miles south of Wallace when the fire suddenly broke out of control, overwhelming the crew.

Drawing on his knowledge of the area and of the dynamics of forest fires, Pulaski led his men to safety in an abandoned prospector&#x27;s mine. After ordering his crew into the mine tunnel, he threatened to shoot with his pistol any man who left. Lying prone on the tunnel floor, all but five of the firefighters survived, though Pulaski himself suffered burns, eye and lung damage, and was temporarily blinded by the fire and smoke. The two horses with them died from smoke inhalation. The mine entrance, now known as the Pulaski Tunnel, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Pulaski remained with the Forest Service until 1929, though the great fire&#x27;s smoke and flames had damaged his lungs and eyes; during that time he petitioned the government for money to care for the graves of the dozens of firefighters killed by the 1910 fire, and for compensation for his wounds.

==Pulaski firefighting tool==
Pulaski is widely credited for the invention of the Pulaski in 1911, a hand tool commonly used in wildland firefighting. A combination hand tool with a mattock for digging or grubbing on one side and an axe for chopping on the other, it is often called a &quot;Pulaski tool&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Mount Pulaski, a peak southwest of Wallace, is named for him.

The US Forest Service&#x27;s Pulaski Tunnel Trail near Wallace, Idaho, provides access to the Nicholson Mine site where Pulaski and his team took shelter.

An initialed (&quot;E.P.&quot;) tool, which purportedly belonged to Pulaski himself, is at the Wallace District Mining Museum in Wallace, Idaho in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

American Singer-Songwriter Steve Earle wrote and recorded a song that largely recounts the story of Ed Pulaski&#x27;s heroic actions and invention, &quot;The Firebreak Line&quot;. It appears on his 2017 album &quot;So You Wannabe An Outlaw&quot;.

Pulaski&#x27;s actions during the Great Fire of 1910 were covered in the &quot;Drunk History&quot; episode &quot;Good Samaritans.&quot;

&quot;&quot;, the firetruck character voiced by Patrick Warburton is named &quot;Pulaski&quot; after the tool, or its inventor.

<doc id="690032" wikidata="Q262498" url="?curid=690032" title="Tracey Gold">
<text>Tracey Gold (born May 16, 1969) is an American actress and former child star known for her role as Carol Seaver on the 1980s sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;.

==Acting career==
Tracey Gold became an actress at the age of four, first appearing in a Pepsi print ad. She appeared in two canceled series, &quot;Shirley&quot; with Shirley Jones in 1979, and &quot;Goodnight Beantown&quot;, starring Bill Bixby in 1983. Gold was originally cast as the youngest daughter in the original pilot series of the sitcom &quot;Gimme A Break!&quot; starring Nell Carter, but was replaced by actress Lara Jill Miller when the show went to series. She played one of Albert Finney and Diane Keaton&#x27;s four daughters in the feature film &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; (1982). 

In 1985, Gold auditioned for the role of Carol Seaver on &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, but was not initially cast. The actress chosen for the pilot was Elizabeth Ward, who had starred alongside Gold in &quot;The Hand-Me-Down Kid&quot;, a 1983 &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot;. However, test audiences did not favor Ward in the role of Carol, and she was replaced by Gold. &quot;Growing Pains&quot; ran from 1985 until 1992. During this time, Gold became a famous teen star and battled anorexia. In 1988, Gold also starred as Angela Strull in the teen film &quot;Dance &#x27;til Dawn&quot;.

On August 9, 1988, Gold and her two sisters were the only celebrities at the funeral of murdered child-actor Judith Barsi. Gold read &quot;A Child of Mine&quot; (from the poet Edgar A. Guest) as a eulogy.

After the end of the series, Gold continued to work as an actress. Over the next decade, she starred in several television movies. In 2003, Gold appeared in an episode of the TV show &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; as the character Penny Barton. Gold was a contestant on the program &quot;Celebrity Mole: Yucatán&quot; in 2004, and starred in the movie &quot;Safe Harbor&quot; in 2006. She hosted the TV Guide Channel mini-show &quot;Trapped in TV Guide&quot;. In addition, she hosted the TLC series &quot;The Secret Life of a Soccer Mom&quot;, which debuted on March 3, 2008. Gold appeared as the spokesperson in &quot;Baby Sleeps Safe&quot;, a national television infomercial for Baby Guardian. On January 2, 2012, she appeared on the ABC network&#x27;s reality series, &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, trading places with singer Carnie Wilson for a week. On July 24, 2013, Gold returned to sitcoms with an appearance on the &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot; episode, &quot;Something Happened,&quot; as one half of a lesbian couple with a home-schooled daughter. Gold starred in the first episode of &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; called &quot;Shot Through The Heart&quot; on ID on August 13, 2014.

She competed on and won the twenty fourth season of &quot;Worst Cooks in America&quot;, the show&#x27;s seventh celebrity edition titled &quot;That&#x27;s So 90s&quot;, airing in April and May 2022.

== Battle with anorexia ==

Gold said around the age of seven, she thought about dieting, having learned the word and the concept on the many television production sets she worked on as a child actress. She became preoccupied with the television movie &quot;The Best Little Girl in the World&quot;, starring actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, about an anorexic teenager. In her autobiography, Gold says that in an attempt to control her development into a woman, she began restricting what she ate. When she was 11, she was diagnosed with the early stages of anorexia nervosa by her family pediatrician after a weight loss that accompanied a growth spurt. After some counseling, she eventually returned to a more normal weight for most of her teenage years. In 1988 at age 19, Gold gained some weight over the &quot;Growing Pains&quot; series hiatus. That season, the sitcom&#x27;s scripts called for her to be the brunt of jokes about her being overweight from her television brothers for many episodes in a row.

Beginning in October 1988, Gold dieted from 133 pounds to about 110 pounds on a medically supervised diet, but still occasionally the scripts continued to include weight-based jokes at her expense. In her autobiography, she says that between 1989 and 1991, she became increasingly obsessed with food and her weight and continued to slowly and steadily lose weight.

In 1990, Gold began group therapy in an eating disorder program, but only learned more ways to lose weight. That season, her problem with weight loss was touched upon slightly on her television series, when Gold is seen looking at her body in a carnival mirror, and describes to another character the distorted image in her head.

In 1991, she started starving herself more than ever and vomiting, and lost a great amount of weight, to the point that she was admitted to a hospital in early 1992. Her lowest weight is estimated to have been near 80 pounds. She was suspended from the show for her skeletal appearance. Photos of Gold&#x27;s emaciated body were plastered all over tabloid magazines, and she was one of the first celebrities ever to be formally outed for anorexia. She last appeared in the 1991 episode &quot;Menage a Luke&quot; after missing the two prior episodes where her problem is very obvious in some scenes, and did not return until the last two episodes of the series in the late spring of 1992, although she was not nearly recovered at this point.

After several years&#x27; struggle, Gold eventually recovered, and starred in the television movie &quot;For the Love of Nancy&quot; (1994) with Jill Clayburgh. The film explored a young woman&#x27;s battle with anorexia and its effects on her family. Although she was warned of the possibility that she had done damage to her reproductive organs by the years of anorexia, Gold was able to give birth to four children.

As she entered her thirties, Gold maintained a normal weight for her body structure, and often holds speaking engagements warning young women about the dangers of eating disorders, while continuing work as an actress.

== Personal life ==
Gold met her husband Roby Marshall through &quot;Growing Pains&quot; co-star Joanna Kerns. Marshall served as a consultant on the true crime miniseries Blind Faith, about the 1984 contract killing of Roby’s mother, Maria, arranged by Roby’s father, Robert. Kerns portrayed Maria in the miniseries.

Gold and Marshall married on October 8, 1994, and have four sons, Sage Gold, Bailey Vincent, Aiden Michael, and Dylan Christopher.

In 2003, Gold wrote the book &quot;Room to Grow: An Appetite for Life&quot; with Julie McCarron, about Gold&#x27;s struggle with and eventual recovery from anorexia.

In 2005, Gold pleaded guilty to a September 3rd, 2004 incident of felony drunken driving. The SUV she was driving had veered off the highway and rolled down an embankment, causing injuries to her husband and two sons. As a result, she was placed on three years&#x27; probation and ordered to complete 30 days of work release and 240 hours of community service.

Her three younger sisters are Missy (best known as Katie on &quot;Benson&quot;), Brandy (best known as Alexis on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;) and Jessie, who has had a variety of guest spots.

<doc id="690034" wikidata="Q863115" url="?curid=690034" title="&quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham">
<text>Eldridge Wayne Coleman Jr. (June 7, 1943 – May 17, 2023), better known by his ring name &quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham, was an American professional wrestler. He gained recognition for his tenure as the WWF Heavyweight Champion from 1977 to 1978. He was a three-time world champion in major professional wrestling promotions. As an award-winning bodybuilder, he was a training partner and close friend of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was most remembered for revolutionizing the interview, which resembled the interviewing style of boxer Muhammad Ali, and physique aspects of the professional wrestling industry, and for his charismatic performance style.

== Early life ==
Coleman was born into a working-class family in Phoenix, Arizona, on June 7, 1943. His father Eldridge was from Mississippi and drove phone poles into the ground for a power company but developed multiple sclerosis and was reassigned to light office work. His mother Juanita, who claimed Cherokee ancestry, was from Arkansas. Coleman was attracted to weight lifting in the fifth grade. As a teenager, he was an avid reader of bodybuilding magazines, his idols being Steve Reeves and John Grimek. As a teenager, he became a devout Christian and traveled to religious revivals where he incorporated feats of strength into his sermons. Wayne was often beaten by his father due to his jealousy of Wayne&#x27;s physique, but one day, he was able to yank the leather strap from his father&#x27;s fingers; his mother also hit him with a brick on his head “because he was too big to hit with anything else.”

Coleman attended North High School, where he was a track and field star and a shot put champion. He also dabbled in amateur and professional boxing, participating in the 1959 Golden Gloves.

Coleman played for the Waterbury Orbits of the Atlantic Coast Football League in 1966. He was a member of the Oakland Raiders of the American Football League in 1967 but did not play in a game. In 1968, Coleman tried out for the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Calgary Stampeders, but he was traded to the Montreal Alouettes and only played in five games while there. He played for the Las Vegas Cowboys of the Continental Football League in 1969. He also worked as a debt collector. In between football engagements, he worked as a bouncer at a bar in Phoenix.

== Bodybuilding career ==
In 1961, Coleman was the winner of the West Coast division of the Mr. Teenage America bodybuilding contest (Frank Zane won the East Coast division), and his photo appeared soon after in Bob Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;Strength and Fitness&quot; magazine. Coleman began to train intensively in 1968 at Gold&#x27;s Gym in Santa Monica, where he worked out with Dave Draper, Franco Columbu and Arnold Schwarzenegger. At this time he was able to bench press 605 lbs (the world record, held by his friend Pat Casey, was 616 lbs). One of Coleman&#x27;s photo shoots with Schwarzenegger was featured that year in Joe Weider&#x27;s &quot;Muscle Fitness&quot; magazine.

When Coleman decided to become a professional wrestler two years later, he had the inspiration of marrying wrestling to bodybuilding. As a wrestler, he weight-trained continually, and in 1975 prepared for the World Bodybuilding Guild&#x27;s Pro Mr. America contest in New York City, where his 22-inch biceps won first place in the Best Developed Arms division. At the peak of his wrestling career in 1977, Coleman weighed 275 lbs. From 1978, he gained more weight and in 1980, at 325 lbs, he took part in the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition in Great Gorge, New Jersey. He finished seventh in this contest in spite of injuring himself in one of the events. On December 6 of the same year, Coleman hosted the U.S. Invitational Powerlifting Championship in Phoenix, Arizona.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early years (1969–1972) ===
In 1969, Coleman was encouraged by football player and occasional professional wrestler Bob Lueck to train with Stu Hart for the latter&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling promotion. He trained under Hart in Calgary before debuting on January 16, 1970, in a match with Dan Kroffat. After wrestling briefly under his real name, Coleman traveled back to the United States in May, wrestling for a few months with Dr. Jerry Graham, Brick Darrow, Rick Cahill and Ron Pritchard in Arizona before he and Jerry joined the National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s Los Angeles promotion (run by Mike LeBell) as a tag team the following August. He changed his ring name to Billy Graham, as a tribute to the famous evangelist of the same name. Jerry also told him to dye his hair blonde with a bottle of Clairol. While wrestling in Championship Wrestling from Florida, the name served both as his ring name and to make him the (kayfabe) youngest brother of Jerry and the other Graham Brothers (Eddie and Luke).

In late December, Graham went north to join Roy Shire&#x27;s NWA San Francisco promotion, working with Pat Patterson (his tag-team partner), Ray Stevens, Cyclone Negro, and Peter Maivia. Graham&#x27;s nearly two-year run in central California included a stint wrestling in Hawaii in February and March 1972. It was during his Californian period that Graham developed a new aspect of his character; before a match he would stage an arm wrestling contest, encouraging public challenges to his title of &quot;Arm Wrestling Champion of the World&quot;.

=== American Wrestling Association (1972–1975) ===
During his time with the AWA, Graham feuded with Gagne, The Crusher, The Bruiser, Wahoo McDaniel, Billy Robinson, Ken Patera and Ivan Koloff, the latter becoming his tag-team partner. By this time, Graham was integrating into his performances not only arm wrestling contests but also weightlifting challenges (mainly involving ex-Olympian Ken Patera) and posing routines. One of his most memorable and violent feuds was against McDaniel, with whom he wrestled numerous bouts between 1973 and 1974. In the AWA, he also began his career feud with &quot;Polish Power&quot; Ivan Putski; the feud would also occur when anti-Polish phrases were being frequently spouted by Archie Bunker against his irreligious Polish-American son-in-law Michael Stivic on lead American television series &quot;All In The Family&quot;.

In September and October 1974, Graham took leave from the AWA to join the International Wrestling Enterprise&#x27;s &quot;Super Wide Series&quot; tour of Japan, where he fought such local stars as Mighty Inoue, Animal Hamaguchi and Rusher Kimura. Following his return from Japan, Graham formed a tag team with Dusty Rhodes. He left the AWA and returned to the NWA in May 1975, signing up with Red Bastien&#x27;s Dallas-based promotion for five months and taking the local &quot;Brass Knucks&quot; title from Mad Dog Vachon on August 8. For most of October, Graham worked for the Mid Atlantic promotion in North Carolina, standing in for Ric Flair, who had just been injured in a plane crash.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation and return to NWA (1975–1976) ===
Graham made his in–ring debut in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on October 25, 1975, in a tag team match at the Boston Garden, in which he and Spiros Arion defeated WWWF Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino and Dominic De Nucci. During this time, The Grand Wizard became Graham&#x27;s manager.

A brief contract with the NWA in Houston, Texas, followed from June to August 1976, after which Graham went on his second tour of Japan, this time accompanied by Ivan Koloff. He feuded with Antonio Inoki during this Japanese run. After returning to America, Graham and Koloff made an unsuccessful attempt to launch their own wrestling promotion in Southern California. In November, on the invitation of Dusty Rhodes, Graham joined the NWA promotion in Florida, beating Rhodes for the Florida heavyweight title on November 22 at the West Palm Beach Auditorium. His work in this period included occasional visits to St Louis, Missouri, where he took on NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race.

=== Return to WWWF (1977–1978) ===

Graham defeated Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship on April 30, 1977, in Baltimore, Maryland, after putting his feet on the ropes. During his reign, he wrestled across America and Japan, facing challengers such as former champion Bruno Sammartino, Jack Brisco, Dusty Rhodes, Pedro Morales, Don Muraco, Mil Mascaras, Strong Kobayashi, Carlos Rocha and Riki Choshu. On January 25, 1978, in Miami, Florida, at the Orange Bowl football stadium, Graham wrestled against then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race in a WWWF Heavyweight Championship vs. NWA World Heavyweight Championship unification match which ended in a one-hour time-limit draw.

Graham eventually lost the title to Bob Backlund on February 20, 1978. Another feud Graham had as champion was with Dusty Rhodes, which culminated in a Texas Bullrope match. His confrontations with Rhodes continued after Graham had been forced to drop the belt to Backlund. Rhodes himself, a long-time friend of Graham&#x27;s, recalled these matches with Graham in 1978 as among the most exciting and memorable of his career.

=== Return to NWA and hiatus (1978–1982) ===
Disillusioned by the loss of his belt, Graham left the WWWF in December 1978 and accepted an offer to join Paul Boesch&#x27;s promotion in Houston, Texas, lending himself out for other NWA events in California and Florida as well. In April 1979, he embarked on his third IWA tour of Japan. On October 8, Graham became the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) World Champion, defeating Pat McGuinness. On November 8, Graham lost the belt to Jerry Lawler in Lexington, Kentucky.

Graham wrestled only three matches (one in Windsor, Ontario, Canada and two in Los Angeles) in 1981, and was reported to have died on November 8. However, that report was false and started by Dusty Rhodes as a joke. In 1982, he spent some time competing in Japan and the United States, adding some martial arts techniques to his repertoire.

=== Second return to WWF (1982–1983) ===

Graham returned to the now-renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in August 1982. He debuted in the promotion with an entirely new look: leaner, with a bald head and mustache, and sporting black karate pants. Graham later stated that he wanted to retire the &quot;Superstar&quot; character out of frustration with Vince McMahon Sr. for not letting him become a fan favorite. After his return, he attacked Backlund, destroying his championship belt. He challenged Backlund for the WWF Championship, but was unable to win the title and left the promotion in April 1983.

=== Return to AWA and third return to NWA (1983–1986) ===

Graham signed up with the AWA again in October 1983, and by the following year, he had regained his earlier body weight. In April 1984, he began his NWA run with Championship Wrestling from Florida, first as a member of Kevin Sullivan&#x27;s Army of Darkness and later as the group&#x27;s opponent after he was tired of Sullivan&#x27;s abuse of his valet, The Lock, and stopped Sullivan from beating her at ringside. In November, Graham joined Jim Crockett Promotions (Mid-Atlantic Wrestling) in North Carolina, working for Paul Jones in his feud against Jimmy Valiant. It was during this stint, in the summer of 1985, that Graham bulked up further, and returned to his tie-dyed look, growing a full goatee and dyeing the mustache blond.

=== Third return to the WWF (1986–1989) ===
Graham returned to the WWF one more time in 1986, . After a few appearances, it was diagnosed in August that he required a hip replacement. The footage of Graham&#x27;s hip replacement surgery was shown on WWF TV on September 27 as a means of promoting his comeback. He returned in mid-1987, but the strain on his hip and ankles proved to be too much. In Syracuse on October 27, the One Man Gang supposedly retired him from active competition permanently with a running splash on the concrete floor after Graham&#x27;s win over Butch Reed. In this incident, aired on the November 14, 1987, episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Don Muraco came to Graham&#x27;s aid, and Graham subsequently became Muraco&#x27;s manager. Graham&#x27;s last wrestling match, also against Butch Reed and at 44 years of age, actually took place on November 7, in St Louis, Missouri. Over the next year, in between bouts of surgery, Graham worked for the WWF as a commentator.

=== Fourth return to WWE (2004–2009) ===

On March 14, 2004, Graham was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004, the night before &quot;WrestleMania XX&quot;, by then-World Heavyweight Champion Triple H, whom Graham had helped inspire to become a professional wrestler. Graham later sold his WWE Hall of Fame ring to purchase anti-rejection medications to help treat his liver transplant.

Several months later, Graham joined WWE on a swing of nine televised events where he was interviewed by Jonathan Coachman (on December 28) before performing a skit which ended with Coachman getting knocked out. On February 25, 2005, Graham appeared at another live event and was again interviewed by Coachman before knocking him out. Three days later, Graham appeared on &quot;Raw&quot;, where he encouraged Randy Orton to do something to make himself notable. On October 3 at &quot;WWE Homecoming&quot;, Graham participated in a Legends Ceremony with 24 other WWE legends. On the January 23, 2006, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he promoted his book and DVD. Graham parted ways with WWE in 2009.

===Fifth return to WWE (2015–2023)===
In November 2015, Graham announced that he had signed a legends contract (a long-term deal to make infrequent, non-wrestling appearances) in a Facebook post. He signed a renewed five-year contract in 2021.

== Legacy ==

Speaking of his legacy, Dave Meltzer of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; wrote: &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for Billy Graham, this industry would be so much different than it is.&quot; Roberta Morgan&#x27;s 1979 kayfabe book &quot;Main Event&quot; stated, &quot;Although he is a rule bender, [Graham] has managed to stay very popular with the fans, probably because of his skill, strength, and colorful personality&quot;. As a headliner in Madison Square Garden, the WWF&#x27;s primary arena throughout his tenure, Graham sold out 19 shows.

Many wrestlers have based their looks and styles on Billy Graham. Some examples are Ric Flair, Austin Idol, Steve Austin, Scott Steiner, Triple H, Hulk Hogan and Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura. Graham was also famous for his characteristic use of the word &quot;brother&quot; in his promos, referring to either commentators or fellow wrestlers. This stems from his background attending evangelical revival meetings, where everybody referred to each other as &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot; (in Christ). Graham&#x27;s use of the word caught on, and since then countless wrestlers have also used &quot;brother&quot; in their own respective promos, most notably Hulk Hogan.

Graham often lectured young athletes on the dangers of steroids. His autobiography, &quot;Tangled Ropes&quot;, was released by WWE on January 10, 2006. WWE also released a DVD about Graham&#x27;s career, titled &quot;20 Years Too Soon: The &quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham Story&quot;. Graham had a new DVD released in 2013 through Seriocity Productions titled &quot;&quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham: Full Disclosure&quot;.

== Disputes with the McMahons ==
In the early 1990s, U.S. federal agents were investigating Dr. George Zahorian, a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, physician who had been dispensing anabolic steroids and other drugs to wrestlers at WWF events. In 1991, Dr. Zahorian was convicted under the U.S. federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 which prohibited the prescription of steroids for non-therapeutic purposes. This led to WWF owner Vince McMahon Jr., who admitted to being a steroid user himself, being put on trial on charges of steroid distribution in 1994. The trial concluded with McMahon&#x27;s acquittal. During this time, Graham personally sued Zahorian and the WWF, claiming that they had forced him to take steroids to maintain his position in the company. His lawsuit was unsuccessful, partly because he had been using steroids for a decade preceding his WWF debut. Recalling the lawsuit on a 2003 episode of &quot;WWE Confidential&quot;, he attributed the litigation to his bitterness and claimed that he was an innovator of steroid use in the organization.

Graham went on a public awareness campaign regarding the dangers of steroids during this time, including an appearance with McMahon on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; in 1992. During the &quot;Donahue&quot; taping, Graham claimed to have witnessed WWF officials sexually abuse children. McMahon claimed the abuse had never taken place, and Graham later admitted that he made up the allegations, hoping to extort &quot;hush money&quot; out of the WWF. In his autobiography, Graham describes making the allegations as being &quot;my most shameful moment, not only in the wrestling profession, but in my life&quot;. Graham wrote an apology to McMahon but received no response until his 2002 liver transplant.

Five years after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, Graham was released from his consultancy position in WWE. He sold his Hall of Fame ring on eBay to help pay for medical bills and requested that he be entirely removed from the Hall of Fame after Abdullah the Butcher was inducted, complaining that Abdullah had never wrestled in the promotion.

Graham spoke out against Linda McMahon during her 2010 Senate campaign, claiming that she was distancing herself from the racy programming that she profited from while acting as CEO for WWE. Upon learning that his liver condition had worsened, Graham reached out to apologize to the McMahons, even offering to be a spokesman for Linda McMahon&#x27;s campaign.

In July 2015, Graham sent a letter to Vince McMahon requesting to take the position of Dusty Rhodes, who had recently died, at NXT. Graham received criticism from fans due to his timing and opportunism. He defended himself, calling his critics &quot;evil subhumans&quot;, and compared a possible reconciliation with McMahon to that of long-time WWE critic Bruno Sammartino, who reconciled with McMahon and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2013.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
As stated in his autobiography &quot;Tangled Ropes&quot;, Graham and his wife Valerie Belkas, whom he married in 1978, were never able to have children. Graham has two children from a previous marriage to Madelyn Miluso; he was also married to Shirley Potts. His daughter Capella was born on June 8, 1972. She was named after a star he read about in the &quot;Atlas of the Universe&quot;. His son Joey was born on March 18, 1975. Joey was born with double pneumonia and an enlarged heart, which was later surgically corrected. Joey&#x27;s godfather was wrestler Dusty Rhodes.

=== Health issues ===
After contracting hepatitis C, Graham received a liver transplant in 2002 from a 26-year-old female donor, who had died in a car crash. He had cirrhosis at the time of his transplant. Graham was again hospitalized on May 24, 2006, due to a bowel obstruction from an earlier surgery.

In July 2010, Graham was hospitalized due to liver problems. Afterward, he announced that he probably only had one year left to live without another liver transplant. He reserved a burial spot at the Green Acres cemetery in Scottsdale, Arizona, next to Eddie Guerrero. On March 31, 2011, &quot;The Phoenix New Times&quot; reported that Graham&#x27;s doctor, Hector Rodriguez-Luna, acknowledged that Graham&#x27;s advanced fibrosis may have been early cirrhosis and that he could live for two more years if he took Interferon—a drug to help slow his hepatitis C—and stayed in shape. By 2012, Graham was diagnosed with third-stage liver disease and cirrhosis.

On January 17, 2013, Graham was hospitalized with double pneumonia and possible heart failure. He was re-hospitalized for a liver complication in October 2014.

On August 2, 2016, Graham was hospitalized while undergoing a medical procedure due to internal bleeding; he underwent surgery the next day to identify the cause of the issues.

In June 2022, it was announced that he needed to have his toes amputated.

=== Death ===
Graham was hospitalized in January 2023 as a result of an ear and skull infection that had left him deaf. By April, his condition had worsened; he had lost 80 pounds and was being treated for kidney, heart and lung problems. He died of sepsis and multiple organ failure on May 17, 2023, three weeks short of his 80th birthday, after having been placed on life support earlier that week.

<text>Agatupu Rodney Anoai (October 2, 1966 – October 23, 2000) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he wrestled under the ring name Yokozuna. He was also known for his appearances with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as Great Kokina.

Anoa&#x27;i&#x27;s character was portrayed as a champion sumo wrestler, with his ring name being a reference to the highest rank in professional sumo wrestling in Japan. While Anoaʻi wrestled as a representative of Japan, he was a Samoan American and was billed as hailing from Polynesia. However, he was managed by the Japanese character Mr. Fuji (in reality a Japanese American) who would follow Anoai to the ring with a wooden bucket of salt while waving a Japanese flag.

In the WWF, Anoai was a two-time WWF World Heavyweight Champion and two-time WWF Tag Team Champion (with Owen Hart), as well as the winner of the 1993 Royal Rumble. He was the first wrestler of Samoan descent to hold the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, as well as the first Royal Rumble winner who (as a result of a direct stipulation) received a WWF world championship title shot at WrestleMania. He defeated WWE Hall of Famers Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan in consecutive pay-per-view victories in the main event of WrestleMania IX, and the 1993 King of the Ring, to win his two WWF Championships, also headlining WrestleMania X against Hart. He was the third-fastest newcomer (after Brock Lesnar and Sheamus) to win the WWF Championship after his debut. He was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2012.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1985–1988) ===
Anoaʻi grew up in a family of wrestlers, the Anoaʻi family; his uncles, the Wild Samoans (Afa Anoaʻi and Sika Anoaʻi) trained him from an early age. He debuted in 1985. He spent the early years of his career performing for promotions such as International World Class Championship Wrestling, Texas All-Star Wrestling, the Universal Wrestling Federation, the Continental Wrestling Association, and the Continental Wrestling Federation under a variety of ring names, including &quot;Giant Kokina&quot;, &quot;Great Kokina&quot;, &quot;Kokina&quot;, and &quot;Kokina the Samoan&quot;. In December 1988, he wrestled for the Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) in Germany, unsuccessfully challenging Otto Wanz for the CWA World Heavyweight Championship.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1988–1992) ===
In August 1988, Anoaʻi began making appearances in Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as &quot;Great Kokina&quot;. In August and September 1988, he took part in the &quot;Sengoku Series&quot; tour, where he faced opponents such as Super Strong Machine and Tatsutoshi Goto, and teamed with fellow &quot;gaijin&quot; including Crusher Bam Bam Bigelow and Scott Hall.

Anoaʻi made his next appearances with NJPW in June and July 1989 as part of its &quot;Summer Fight Series&quot;. During this tour, he repeatedly teamed with Big Van Vader and Mike Kirchner, with his opponents including Kengo Kimura, Masa Saito, and Riki Choshu. In October and November that year, Anoaʻi made a third tour of Japan as part of NJPW&#x27;s &quot;Toukon Series&quot;; during this stint, he again repeatedly teamed with Big Van Vader, while his opponents included Choshu, Kimura, Masahiro Chono, and Osamu Kido.

Anoaʻi wrestled a fourth stint with NJPW in January and February 1990 as part of its &quot;New Spring Gold Series&quot;. During this tour he once again teamed with Big Van Vader, as well as teaming with his future World Wrestling Federation tag team partner Owen Hart. On the final day of his tour, he and Vader unsuccessfully challenged Masa Saito and Shinya Hashimoto for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. He returned to NJPW for one week in July 1990 during the &quot;Wrestling Scramble&quot;, teaming with Wild Samoan as the Samoan SWAT Team and unsuccessfully challenging Keiji Muto and Masahiro Chono for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. He had a short sixth stint with NJPW in September 1990 during the &quot;Explosion Tour&quot;, once again teaming with Wild Samoan.

Anoaʻi returned to NJPW for a seventh stint in April 1991 during that year&#x27;s &quot;Explosion Tour&quot;. This stint saw the Samoan SWAT Team primarily wrestle six-man tag team matches, teaming with Scott Norton or Pegasus Kid. He made a sixth stint with NJPW in July 1991 as part of the &quot;Summer Crush&quot; tour and a seventh stint in September 1991 as part of the &quot;Battle Autumn&quot; tour, again teaming with Wild Samoan. At the end of the Battle Autumn tour, Anoaʻi took part in the &quot;Memorial Battle in Yokohama&quot; event at the Yokohama Arena, teaming with Wild Samoan, Pegasus Kid, and Brad Armstrong to defeat Black Cat, Kengo Kimura, Osamu Kido, and Shiro Koshinaka. In October 1991, Anoaʻi and Great Kokina took part in the Super Grade Tag League; they defeated Kim Duk and Tiger Jeet Singh, but lost their other five matches, ultimately placing in joint last place with two points.

Anoaʻi made a ninth stint with NJPW in March 1992 as part of the &quot;Big Fight Series&quot;, once again teaming with Wild Samoan as the Samoan SWAT Team; the main event of the final day of the series saw the Samoan SWAT Team and Big Van Vader lose to Keiji Muto, Masahiro Chono, and Riki Choshu in the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo. In June and July 1992, the Samoan SWAT Team wrestled on the &quot;Masters of Wrestling&quot; tour. Anoaʻi made his final appearances with NJPW in September 1992 as part of its &quot;Battle Autumn&quot; tour. His last match took place at the &quot;Battle Hold Arena&quot; event at the Yokohama Arena, where the Samoan SWAT Team lost to Raging Staff (Super Strong Machine and Tatsutoshi Goto).

=== American Wrestling Association (1989–1990) ===
In 1989, Anoa&#x27;i received his first major exposure in the United States when he joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA) as &quot;Kokina Maximus&quot;. Managed by Sheik Adnan El Kassey, he depicted a disheveled Samoan wild man, and was billed as the biggest Samoan wrestler ever. In late-1989, an angle was booked in which he repeatedly delivered a big splash to Greg Gagne, marking the end of Gagne&#x27;s career. Anoaʻi made his final appearance with the AWA in April 1990, losing to Yukon John Nord in a lumberjack match at SuperClash IV.

=== Universal Wrestling Association (1990–1992) ===
In February 1990, Anoaʻi began wrestling for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) in Mexico as &quot;Great Kokina&quot;. He initially wrestled primarily in two-out-of-three falls matches. In March 1991, he unsuccessfully challenged El Canek for the UWA World Heavyweight Championship. In April 1991, Anoaʻi and his cousins Fatu and Samoan Savage (with the trio collectively billed as the &quot;Hawaiian Beasts&quot;) defeated Los Villanos for the UWA World Trios Championship. Los Villanos regained the titles in a rematch the following month. For the remainder of his tenure in the UWA, Anoaʻi continued to wrestle primarily in two-out-of-three falls matches (including teaming with Black Scorpio and Buffalo Allen in a loss to André the Giant, El Canek, and Villano III in May 1992), as well as again unsuccessfully challenging El Canek for the UWA World Heavyweight Championship on several other occasions. He made his final appearances with the promotion in August 1992.

===World Wrestling Federation (1992–1998) ===

==== WWF Champion (1992–1994) ====
In 1992, Anoai was contacted by Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and offered a roster spot along with The Samoans (Fatu and Samoan Savage). On the August 17 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, the Samoans (soon to be the Headshrinkers) made their debut. Commentator Gorilla Monsoon made mention of another, larger Samoan that they would soon be seeing in the WWF. Anoaʻi made his initial debut as Kokina in an untelevised match on September 1, at a &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; taping in Hershey, Pennsylvania, defeating Ron Neal. This would be the only time that Anoaʻi wrestled under his former gimmick, as shortly after, he was offered a new gimmick: Yokozuna.

Managed by Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna debuted on the October 31, 1992 edition of &quot;Superstars&quot; with his then new gimmick of a stereotypical sumo wrestler, who competed under the Japanese flag; though the WWF tactfully acknowledged his Samoan roots. He wore a &quot;mawashi&quot; as part of his ring attire, but wore long tights underneath the loincloth, something that Vince McMahon and Yokozuna&#x27;s cousin Rikishi later felt wasn&#x27;t needed and that he should&#x27;ve worn the traditional &quot;mawashi&quot; without the tights to expose his buttocks (which Rikishi himself would later do). Anoaʻi also revamped his appearance as Yokozuna by gaining additional weight, becoming clean shaven and transforming his unruly hair into a chonmage. He made his pay-per-view debut on November 25 at Survivor Series, easily defeating the much smaller Virgil with his huge weight advantage. Yokozuna&#x27;s career soon took off and he was billed as a potential favorite to win the Royal Rumble match on January 24, 1993, doing so by last eliminating Randy Savage. Having cemented his movement towards main-event status, Yokozuna was a competitor in the first-ever match in &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; history, defeating the much smaller Koko B. Ware with his signature finisher, the Banzai Drop. Soon after, Yokozuna was challenged by American patriot &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan, who aimed to be the first man to knock Yokozuna off his feet (this was taped before Randy Savage knocked down Yokozuna at the Royal Rumble). On the February 6 airing of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Duggan succeeded in knocking Yokozuna down, only for Yokozuna to sneak attack Duggan with a bucket of salt Mr. Fuji had brought to the ring, and crush him with four Banzai Drops, the fourth being with the American flag draped over Duggan. Afterwards, Duggan was suffering from (kayfabe) internal bleeding. On the May 10, 1993, edition of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Yokozuna served as one of the lumberjacks in a match between Duggan and Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship. Duggan, upon seeing Yokozuna, immediately charged at him and knocked him off his feet again; late in the match, after Bam Bam Bigelow distracted Duggan, Michaels attacked the challenger from behind and threw him out of the ring to where Yokozuna was standing. Yokozuna knocked Duggan to the floor and nailed him with a leg drop, then rolled his unconscious body back into the ring as payback for the earlier attack.

At WrestleMania IX on April 4, Yokozuna wrestled against Bret Hart for the WWF Championship. Hart had the match won with Yokozuna about to submit to the Sharpshooter, when Mr. Fuji threw salt into the champion&#x27;s face. Blinded, Hart was then pinned by Yokozuna, who won the WWF Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;WrestleMania 9 – Yokozuna vs Hart/Hogan vs Yokozuna&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As he and Mr. Fuji celebrated, Hulk Hogan came to the ring to help Hart and was challenged by Mr. Fuji to take on the new champion. After Fuji accidentally threw salt in Yokozuna&#x27;s eyes, Hogan came through with the win and captured his fifth WWF Championship. At the time, Yokozuna held the record for the second shortest time (after Ric Flair) to win the WWF Championship after his debut, with 173 days (currently, Yokozuna holds the fourth shortest time, after Flair, Sheamus, and Brock Lesnar). On June 13 at King of the Ring, Yokozuna, whose weight increased from to , challenged Hogan for the title. Hogan seemed to have the match won, but a photographer, planted at ringside among a legitimate Japanese wrestling press group, shot a blast of fire into Hogan&#x27;s face. This allowed Yokozuna to take Hogan out with a leg drop and regain the WWF Championship, after which he proceeded to hit Hogan with the Banzai Drop in the corner. Hogan then left the WWF to pursue other interests, leaving Yokozuna and Fuji to claim that they had ended &quot;Hulkamania&quot;. To celebrate, he held a &quot;Bodyslam Competition&quot; aboard the , a decommissioned aircraft carrier, on Independence Day. Many wrestlers and athletes failed to slam Yokozuna until Lex Luger flew in by helicopter, stepped forward, and slammed him on the deck. Commentator Bobby Heenan claimed Luger&#x27;s move was a hiptoss, not a bodyslam, as Yokozuna was running at Luger, but the slam was ruled legitimate. This made Luger the next major challenger to Yokozuna&#x27;s title.

On August 30 at SummerSlam, Yokozuna, now weighing , and Luger fought for the WWF Championship. Luger took control late in the match, scoring on Yokozuna with a bodyslam and flying forearm. Luger had metal plates put into his arm following an injury from a motorcycle accident (it was stipulated that Luger had to wear a protective pad over it, but it was torn off in the course of the match). However, Yokozuna was knocked out of the ring unconscious and lost via count-out, though he retained the title because it could not change hands via count-out. The contract Luger had signed for the match, as orchestrated by Yokozuna&#x27;s new spokesman and advisor James E. Cornette, stated that if he did not win the championship, he would not get another shot at the title. Yokozuna and Luger continued to feud until Survivor Series on November 24, where each chose a team of allies for an elimination match, which was billed as an All-Americans (Lex Luger, The Undertaker, and Steiner Brothers) vs. Foreign Fanatics (Yokozuna, Quebecer Jacques, Ludvig Borga, and Crush) contest. Yokozuna was eliminated via double count-out after brawling with the Undertaker outside of the ring; the All-Americans went on to win the match.

Yokozuna&#x27;s next title challenger was The Undertaker, whom he was eventually forced to accept a casket match with. The match occurred on January 22, 1994, at Royal Rumble, which Yokozuna won by shoving the Undertaker in the casket with help from multiple heel wrestlers. After the match, a mysterious figure appeared on the titantron, looking like the Undertaker inside the casket. He opened his eyes and said the Undertaker would not rest in peace; he then disappeared in a smoke and light show, rising to the top of the titantron and seemingly levitating all the way to the arena ceiling until vanishing. This storyline was used to allow the Undertaker to rest for several months to recover from lingering real-life injuries.

In the Royal Rumble match, the last two competitors, Lex Luger and Bret Hart, fought and eliminated each other simultaneously. Since the winner of the Royal Rumble was to become the number one contender to Yokozuna&#x27;s title, it was decided that both wrestlers would get a shot at the title at WrestleMania X. By virtue of winning a coin toss, Luger got to wrestle Yokozuna first at the event. The winner of that match would go on to face Bret Hart later in the evening with the title on the line. To obviate the risk of outside interference, both title matches were scheduled to have special guest referees, with Mr. Perfect as the referee for the Luger/Yokozuna bout. Luger had knocked out Yokozuna with a running forearm smash in the middle of the ring, as well as Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette, but when he went for the pin, Perfect occupied himself with the unconscious Fuji and Cornette who were still lying on the ring apron. An angry Luger was disqualified after pushing Mr. Perfect, making Yokozuna the first villainous champion to successfully defend the WWF Championship at WrestleMania. Later in the night, Yokozuna defended the championship again, this time against Bret Hart, who had lost earlier in the night to his brother Owen Hart. For this match, Roddy Piper was the special referee, attacking Cornette when he tried to break a pinfall. At the end of the match, Yokozuna seemed ready to hit his finishing maneuver, the Banzai Drop, but lost his balance and took a fall from the ropes. Hart pinned Yokozuna to win the title, ending Yokozuna&#x27;s reign at 280 days.

After dropping the belt, Yokozuna&#x27;s main event status began to fade away. He briefly tagged with Crush, another Mr. Fuji charge. On the May 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Yokozuna lost to Earthquake in the only (worked) sumo match until WrestleMania 21, between The Big Show and an actual &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Akebono. At King of the Ring on June 19, Yokozuna and Crush failed to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). Yokozuna then had to deal with the &quot;rebirth&quot; of the Undertaker, who immediately came after the foe who had taken him out of action. The two met in another casket match on November 23 at Survivor Series, this time with actor/karate expert Chuck Norris as the special enforcer to keep the other heel wrestlers away from ringside. Without their help (although Irwin R. Schyster successfully interfered on Yokozuna&#x27;s behalf), Yokozuna lost the match and ended up locked inside the casket. Yokozuna continued to wrestle briefly before taking some time off to increase his already huge weight advantage.

==== Teaming with Owen Hart; departure (1995–1998) ====
In April 1995, Owen Hart began promising that he would have a great tag team partner to face off against The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart) at WrestleMania XI for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At the event on April 2, Yokozuna, now weighing in at , was revealed as his partner, and the team defeated the Gunns to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. The two retained the titles against the Gunns in a rematch on May 14 at In Your House 1 and against the Allied Powers (Lex Luger and Davey Boy Smith) on July 23 at In Your House 2.

At In Your House 3 on September 24, Yokozuna and Davey Boy Smith took on Shawn Michaels and Diesel (the back story being that Hart was with his wife as she gave birth to one of their children) with Diesel&#x27;s WWF Championship, Shawn Michaels&#x27; Intercontinental Championship and Hart and Yokozuna&#x27;s Tag Team Championship on the line. During the match, Hart came to the ring, only to be pinned by Diesel. The next day, due to protests from the team and the legal help of Clarence Mason, President Gorilla Monsoon reluctantly returned the belts to Yokozuna and Hart, since Hart was not an official part of the match. Their second reign was shorter, as the Smoking Gunns defeated them that night for the belts.

Yokozuna, by now weighing in at , had little continued success in 1996. He competed in the Royal Rumble match on January 21, eliminating Bob Backlund, King Mabel, and Swat Team member #2 before being tossed out by eventual winner Shawn Michaels. Although Cornette tried to make peace between him and new acquisition Vader, many observers felt Yokozuna was being relegated. After several run-ins, Yokozuna left Cornette and began a short stint as a fan favorite. He spoke English to the fans, had Mr. Fuji wave an American flag during his matches, and challenged Vader to numerous matches. On March 31 at WrestleMania XII, Yokozuna, Ahmed Johnson and Jake Roberts lost to Vader, Owen Hart and British Bulldog. Vader jumped on Yokozuna&#x27;s leg on the April 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, (kayfabe) breaking it. The splash was shown on television as a leg break, but in reality, it was performed to allow Yokozuna to take some time off to lose weight. However, instead of a stretcher, a real forklift had to be brought to carry Yokozuna out, as it was the only way to move a man of his size.

In May, Yokozuna returned at In Your House 8: Beware of Dog to wrestle Vader. During the event, a severe thunderstorm in the area caused the pay-per-view broadcast feed to blackout. In one of the matches not broadcast, Yokozuna defeated Vader. The event was rescheduled two days later, in which the matches that were previously blacked-out took place again. Vader won their rematch. On August 17, he appeared at &quot;Free for All&quot; just before SummerSlam, where he lost to Stone Cold Steve Austin after he attempted a Banzai Drop on the rope, which broke under his weight, sending him crashing back down for Austin to win.

The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Yokozuna faced then WWF Champion Shawn Michaels for the title in a losing effort. Afterwards, he only made appearances on house shows. He made his final televised WWF appearance at the Survivor Series on November 17, still going after Vader, however he only briefly entered the match illegally and it ended with all remaining wrestlers being disqualified. His final match in the WWF was on November 20, 1996, at a house show in White Plains, New York in a battle royal won by his cousin Rocky Maivia.

For a second time, Yokozuna went to his home in Los Angeles to lose weight through exercise and dieting, being replaced by other wrestlers on a late November 1996 tour of the United Kingdom. Despite dropping a reported , he still could not lose enough to satisfy the WWF officials, and was not medically cleared to wrestle in some states because of his physical condition. Yokozuna was ultimately unable to pass a physical examination required for professional wrestlers by the New York State Athletic Commission, and was released from the WWF in May 1998.

=== Independent circuit (1998–2000) ===
After his WWF career ended in 1998, he performed sporadically for various independent promotions, including Maryland Championship Wrestling. At the Heroes of Wrestling pay-per-view event on October 10, 1999, Yokozuna was scheduled to take on King Kong Bundy in one of the event&#x27;s two featured matches. However, Jake Roberts, who was scheduled to face Jim Neidhart in the other main event match, came to the ring for his match intoxicated and in no condition to wrestle. The promoters made a last-minute change and Yokozuna teamed with Roberts against Bundy and Neidhart, and Yokozuna&#x27;s team lost. He wrestled his final match on October 2, 2000 (three weeks prior to his death) for All Star Wrestling, teaming with Greg Valentine to defeat Cowboy Carter and Drew McDonald in Cannock in the United Kingdom.

== Filmography ==
== Personal life ==
Anoai was a member of the Anoaʻi wrestling family, with Roman Reigns, Rikishi, Samu, Rosey, Manu, Umaga, and The Rock among his cousins. The Usos and Solo Sikoa were his nephews and Afa and Sika were his uncles. He had two children, Justin and Keilani. He also suffered from arachnophobia, and claimed to devour 240 eggs, 12 pieces of chicken and a bucket-sized portion of Japanese rice every day.

== Death ==
On October 23, 2000, Anoai died in his sleep from pulmonary edema in his seventh-floor room at the Moat House Hotel on Paradise Street in Liverpool while on a wrestling tour of the UK for All Star Wrestling. He was 34 years old. His body was found by his crew&#x27;s transport manager, and after paramedics came into his hotel room, it took six men to move his body. At the time, it was widely reported that he died of heart failure or a heart attack, but this was later found to be incorrect due to his lungs showing severe signs of fluid blockage.

== Legacy ==
The Yokozuna Memorial Show was held in Allentown, Pennsylvania in November 2001, shortly after the first anniversary of Anoaʻi&#x27;s death. It was presented by the independent promotion World Xtreme Wrestling, although matches included wrestlers from multiple promotions.

On March 31, 2012, Yokozuna was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by his nephews The Usos and cousin Rikishi.

The , and their residents, are represented in the Parliament of Bhutan, a bicameral legislature consisting of the National Council and the National Assembly. Each has one National Council representative. National Assembly representatives are distributed among the in proportion to their registered voter population as recommended by the Delimitation Commission, provided that &quot;no shall have less than two and more than seven National Assembly constituencies.&quot;

Thimphu is the most densely populated, with , whereas Gasa is the least densely populated, with .

==History==

Medieval Bhutan was organized into provinces or regions headquartered in (castles/fortresses) which served as administrative centres for areas around them. The of Paro, Dagana and Trongsa were headed by (provincial lords/governors) while other were headed by (fortress lords). and gained power as the increasingly dysfunctional dual system of government eventually collapsed amid civil war. The victorious Penlop of Trongsa Ugyen Wangchuck gained sovereignty over the entire realm in 1907, marking the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Bhutan and the ascendancy of the House of Wangchuck.

At the direction of the fourth (Bhutan head of state), Jigme Singye Wangchuk, the process of decentralisation of local administration started in 1981 with the formation of a (DYT, district development committee) in each of the newly created .

Four (zones) were established in 1988 and 1989: Zone I, including four western districts, seated at Chhukha; Zone II, including four west-central districts, seated at Damphu; Zone III, including four east-central districts, seated at Geylegphug; and Zone IV, including five eastern districts, seated at Yonphula; to &quot;provide a more efficient distribution of personnel and administrative and technical skills.&quot; acted as the intermediary administrative divisions between the administration and the central government. Although Thimphu and Thimphu (municipality) were within the boundaries of Zone I, they stayed outside the zonal system. By 1991, however, only Eastern (Zone IV) was fully functional. Zone I, Zone II and Zone III were &quot;indefinitely&quot; disabled in early 1991. Zone IV also ceased to function in mid-1992. slowly lost relevance and went defunct as they were not included in the Constitution of Bhutan and the Local Government Act of 2009, which repealed the previous local governments and administrative divisions.

Under the (District Development Council Act) of 2002, a (administrator), assisted by a (deputy district collector), carry out administrative activities, while the DYT coordinates all developmental activities within the . Each DYT includes representatives of the municipalities and the towns within the , who elect a chairperson from among themselves. The DYTs also had non-voting members, which included the , the ( (sub-district) head) (where a exists) and the officials from various sectors such as the chief engineer, and the planning, finance, education, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and health officers.

The Constitution of 2008 laid basic provisions for an elected and courts in each . The Local Government Act of 2009 further codified the election process of , the appointment process of , and the role of courts within the judicial system of Bhutan. It also repealed all previous acts and laws regarding local governments, including the of 2002.

==Political structure==
Under the Local Government Act of 2009, the is the non-legislative executive body of the , composed of the ( head) and the (elected representatives of the ) from each (block of villages), and representatives from the of that . They are empowered to enforce rules on health and public safety, regulate environmental pollution, advertise in regard to environmental aesthetics, regulate broadcast media in accordance with the Information, Communications, and Media Act, regulate gambling, and raise their own funds.

<text>The Long Kiss Goodnight is a 1996 American action thriller film co-produced and directed by Renny Harlin, and produced by Shane Black and Stephanie Austin with screenplay written by Black. It stars Geena Davis, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Amandes, Yvonne Zima, Brian Cox, Patrick Malahide, Craig Bierko, and David Morse. The story follows an amnesiac schoolteacher (Davis) who sets out to recover her identity with the help of a private detective (Jackson) when they discover a dark conspiracy.

Released by New Line Cinema on October 11, 1996, it grossed almost $96 million against a budget of $65 million, and gained a strong cult following.

==Plot==
Samantha Caine is a schoolteacher in small-town Honesdale, Pennsylvania, living with her boyfriend, Hal, and her daughter, Caitlin. Eight years earlier, she was found washed ashore on a New Jersey beach, pregnant with Caitlin, and totally amnesiac. Having never remembered her real name, &quot;Samantha&quot; has hired several ineffective private investigators to discover her past, the latest being the down-on-his-luck Mitch Henessey. During the Christmas holidays, Samantha is involved in a car accident and suffers a brief concussion; when she recovers, she finds she possesses skills with a knife that she cannot explain. Shortly thereafter, the family home is broken into by &quot;One-Eyed Jack&quot;, a convict who escaped from jail after seeing Samantha&#x27;s face on television. Samantha demonstrates her fighting prowess by killing Jack bare-handed. Worried that she poses a danger to Hal and Caitlin, Samantha leaves with Mitch, who has found a suitcase belonging to her, to seek out answers.

The suitcase contains a note directing them to Dr. Nathan Waldman. They arrange to meet at a train station unaware that government agents are tapping the doctor&#x27;s calls. En route, Samantha discovers the bottom of the suitcase contains a disassembled sniper rifle which she can expertly reassemble, along with other weapons. When Samantha and Mitch go to meet Waldman at the station, they are attacked by a team of agents who shoot numerous bystanders, but the two escape with Waldman&#x27;s help. The doctor informs Samantha that she is really an expert CIA assassin, Charlene Elizabeth &quot;Charly&quot; Baltimore, who had disappeared eight years earlier.

Unsure if they can trust Waldman, Samantha and Mitch leave him behind and seek another contact named on a note in the suitcase, Luke, believing he may be Charly&#x27;s fiancé.

Waldman catches up with them, trying to warn them that Luke is actually Charly&#x27;s last assassination target, &quot;Daedalus.&quot; However, Luke kills Dr. Waldman before he can warn them. Samantha is then tortured with repeated near-drowning experiences for information. During this process, her real identity fully resurfaces and her memory returns. Samantha frees herself, kills Luke, and escapes with Mitch. Samantha completes her physical transformation back to Charly, cutting her hair and dying it platinum blonde. Charly realizes that her &quot;Samantha Caine&quot; personality was a cover to get near to Daedalus eight years earlier.

A psychological-operations specialist named Timothy, with whom Charly once had a romantic relationship, kidnaps Caitlin.

Charly and Mitch learn about Daedalus&#x27; involvement in &quot;Project Honeymoon&quot;, which she disrupted on her mission, resulting in One-Eyed Jack&#x27;s incarceration; &quot;Project Honeymoon&quot; was intended to be a false flag chemical bomb detonation in Niagara Falls, planned by the CIA in an attempt to blame Islamic terrorists and secure more funding. Charly realizes that Timothy and a new group are plotting to restage the attack led by CIA Director Leland Perkins. In Niagara Falls, where Timothy has taken Caitlin, he captures Mitch and Charly. She tells Timothy that he is Caitlin&#x27;s biological father and implores him not to hurt their daughter. However, Timothy is ultimately unmoved, locking Charly and Caitlin in a freezer to kill them.

Charly and Caitlin break out of the freezer by detonating barrels of kerosene and then freeing Mitch, who helps Charly attack the staging area. This forces Timothy to launch the attack early; meanwhile, Caitlin locks herself in a cage on the truck carrying the bomb. Charly chases the truck, overpowers its driver, diverts it from a Christmas parade, and overturns it on the Niagara Falls International Bridge leading to Canada.

Charly frees Caitlin but they cannot get away from the bomb, which is about to explode, as Timothy and his agents attack them from a helicopter. Mitch suddenly arrives in a car, picking up Charly and Caitlin and entering Canada just before the bomb explodes, which kills Timothy and his forces and destroys the bridge.

In an epilogue, Charly has returned to her assumed identity of Samantha Caine, moving with Caitlin and Hal to a remote farmhouse and declining an offer from the president to join the State Department (which could imply rejoining the CIA). Mitch enjoys the publicity attracted by his role in the crisis and is interviewed by Larry King on television about Perkins, who was indicted for treason.

==Cast==

In addition, Joseph McKenna plays One-Eyed Jack, while Larry King has a cameo as himself.

==Production==
In 1994, New Line Cinema paid a then-record million (equivalent to $ million in ) for Black&#x27;s script.

In an early cut of the film, Mitch Henessey died, but during a test screening an audience member shouted, &quot;You can&#x27;t kill Sam Jackson!&quot; Harlin changed the final cut so that Jackson&#x27;s character survived.

On February 27, 1996, during filming at the 127-year-old Windermere House in Ontario, Canada, a fire broke out, leaving only the stone verandah intact. There was speculation that it was caused by film lighting; however, it may have been a short circuit. When the fire started, filming was taking place on the frozen lake, with the house lighted from within to be seen in the background. It is unknown whether the fire was directly associated with filming, but the building was otherwise closed for the winter. Ironically, some of the remaining scenes there involved fire, but the real fire prevented them from being shot. The film crew helped evacuate nearby homes, but the fire did not spread beyond the building. The house was rebuilt and its support buildings were expanded the next year.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Over its opening weekend, the film grossed $9,065,363 from 2,245 theaters, coming in third among films opening that weekend. It grossed $33,447,612 in the US and Canada and $62,009,149 internationally, for a worldwide gross of $95,456,761.

Renny Harlin blamed the film&#x27;s poor performance on confusing advertising, but Shane Black wondered if it might have been more successful if it were about a man: &#x27;It might have made more money, they told me, but it &quot;had&quot; to be a woman. The lead had to be female.&#x27; It has also been suggested that the film&#x27;s poor advertising campaign and lukewarm critical reception may have been a carry-over effect from Renny Harlin and Geena Davis&#x27;s previous collaboration, &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;, which was released 10 months earlier and was one of the biggest box office bombs of all time.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; received mainly positive reviews. It holds a 67% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Smart, sharp-witted, and fueled by enjoyably over-the-top action, &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; makes up in impact what it lacks in consistent aim.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 44 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a median grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Christine James from &quot;Boxoffice&quot; gave it 3 and a half out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;a lot of fun&quot;, but believing that there were some weaknesses in the script. Roger Ebert gave it 2 and a half out of 4 stars, stating, &quot;I admired it as an example of craftsmanship, but what a lot of time and money to spend on something of no real substance.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films and &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight &quot;placed 82nd on the list.

In retrospect, Geena Davis said: “I love that movie. My character might be my favorite role—it’s a close call between Thelma and that one. Anyway, that movie came out great and got some good reception, but it didn’t soar to heights, let’s say, perhaps as we wanted it to.”
Samuel L. Jackson stated that &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; was his favorite movie to watch that he was in. Of all the films he’s made, Renny Harlin said &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; was his favorite:

&quot;It is definitely. For me, it’s just very simple. It&#x27;s a movie that had a really good screenplay, which meant that I was able to get really good actors … It&#x27;s always challenging to make a movie, but it sure makes it easier when you have a good screenplay like in that one. When you have characters that are complex, and you have good drama and have some humour and some good action, you kind of have all the ingredients. When you have that you don&#x27;t even need some crazy special effects—you just need to let the characters do their thing. It was a great experience.&quot;

The film has become a popular Christmas movie, as an alternative to &quot;Die Hard&quot;.

==Sequel==
The last page of Black&#x27;s original 1994 script stated that there would be a sequel called &quot;The Kiss After Lightning&quot; that never happened.

While a possible sequel was reportedly in the works in 2007, no sequel has been produced as of 2025.

<text>Khobar () is a city and governorate in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, situated on the coast of the Persian Gulf. With a population of 409,549 in the city core and 658,550 in the governorate, as of 2022, Khobar forms part of the Dammam metropolitan area along with Dammam and Dhahran, making up the residential core of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Persian Gulf region.

The city was founded alongside Dammam by the Dawasir, who moved there in 1923 fearing British persecution with the permission of King Abdulaziz Al Saud. Khobar experienced rapid growth during and after the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia as it served as the port for the oil exports of Saudi Aramco in the company&#x27;s early days. Traditionally, Khobar has also been a city of shopkeepers and merchants, and today has several shopping malls in and around it.

The city is the newest in the Dammam metropolitan area, facing the Persian Gulf with its 16-km long Corniche Road, which runs parallel to the city&#x27;s eastern coast. Khobar is also considered a resort town as its southern suburbs of the city face the Half Moon Bay and host several beaches and beach resorts. By night, the quiet city turns into a bustling one, with some of the largest malls in the kingdom, such as the &quot;Mall of Dhahran&quot; and the &quot;al-Rashid Mall&quot;. The city is also home to the historic &quot;Suwaiket Street&quot;, officially known as Prince Bandar ibn Abdulaziz Street, which is home to some of the oldest markets in the city. The same could also be said about King Khalid Street and Prince Mohammed Street.

The Khobar governorate is further divided into several municipalities, with Khobar as their capital. &#x27;Issam ibn Abdullatif al-Mulla has been serving as the mayor of the governorate since the Islamic year 1428 AH (2007 CE).

==History==
The city shares a similar history with Dammam. In the early 1930s, Khobar was mainly a fishing hamlet inhabited by members of the Dawasir tribe, who moved there in 1923, fearing British persecution with the permission of King Abdulaziz. The tribe settled in Khobar for its proximity to Bahrain as they had hoped to return to their homeland. The Khobar Governorate was incorporated in 1942 and with the discovery of oil in nearby areas, a port was built in the southern parts of the modern city to facilitate the export of petroleum to Bahrain.

The city quickly transformed into a residential hub and a commercial and industrial port. It soon lost these privileges as commercial operations were transferred to the King Abdulaziz Port in Dammam and the petroleum exports were transferred to Ras Tanura. As a result, Khobar retained its status as the residential core of the area, but over time, its streets slowly became densely packed with markets. Its northern waterfront along the Persian Gulf has been transformed into a corniche, with beaches and resorts to the south on Half Moon Bay.

While most of Khobar&#x27;s districts are built upon the grid system, unlike Dammam, most of the buildings in the city&#x27;s main districts are a mix of commercial and residential complexes, with masjids of varied designs and colours adorning its many streets.

Islamist militants carried out attacks in 1996 and 2004.

After he was trained by Tojo Yamamoto, Eudy made his debut as he teamed with Austin Idol and wrestled the team of Nick Bockwinkel and Jerry Lawler. He began his career in Continental Championship Wrestling (CCW) in 1987 under the masked wrestler persona Lord Humungous. On Christmas Day 1987, Sid won the NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship (Northern Division). Later, he turned into a fan favorite after rekindling a (kayfabe) childhood friendship with Shane Douglas, resulting in the two forming a tag team and capturing the NWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship.

He competed in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he challenged Tatsumi Fujinami for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship under the name Vicious Warrior, but was unable to win the title. Eudy then made a very brief stint in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), where he adopted one of his most notable ring names: Sid Vicious, which he took from the punk rock musician of the same name who played bass for the Sex Pistols.

=== NWA World Championship Wrestling (1989–1991) ===

==== The Skyscrapers (1989) ====

In 1989, Eudy signed with World Championship Wrestling and retained his Sid Vicious ring name. He made his televised debut in WCW by defeating DeWayne Bruce on the June 17, 1989, episode of &quot;Pro&quot;. Originally slated as a singles wrestler, Eudy was eventually paired with Danny Spivey to form The Skyscrapers, and were managed by Teddy Long. The Skyscrapers feuded with The Road Warriors and The Steiner Brothers. During that time, he incorporated the Powerbomb as his finishing move. The team was short-lived, as Eudy was replaced by &quot;Mean&quot; Mark Callous after breaking a rib and puncturing a lung during a match with The Steiner Brothers on November 15 at &quot;Clash of the Champions IX&quot;.

==== Four Horsemen (1990–1991) ====

After his recovery, Eudy was introduced on the May 11, 1990 edition of &quot;NWA Power Hour&quot; as the newest member of Ric Flair&#x27;s Four Horsemen. Sid was the &quot;muscle&quot; of the group and initially brought in to counter-act the strength of RoboCop at Capital Combat. His first televised match back was a 26-second loss to Lex Luger on June 13 at &quot;Clash of the Champions XI&quot; after the referee performed a fast three count. As one of the Horsemen, Eudy feuded with Paul Orndorff and the Junkyard Dog. He attacked NWA World Heavyweight Champion Sting following the champion&#x27;s title match at &quot;Clash of the Champions XII&quot; in September, setting up his first feud as a singles wrestler. On October 27 at Halloween Havoc, a fake Sting (Barry Windham), in collusion with Sid, let Sid pin him after switching places with the real Sting in order for Sid to win the belt. They were thwarted when the real Sting came out and beat Sid to retain the title.

Sid&#x27;s association with the Horsemen became tenuous following this episode, and he began a quasi-face run on November 20, when he defeated The Nightstalker at &quot;Clash of the Champions XIII: Thanksgiving Thunder&quot;. On December 16, The Skyscrapers had a short-lived reunion when Sid and former partner Spivey defeated Big Cat and The Motor City Madman at Starrcade. Following this match, Eudy made an abrupt return to heel status, squashing Joey Maggs at &quot;Clash of the Champions XIV: Dixie Dynamite&quot; on January 30, 1991. He returned to full-fledged Horsemen activity and participated in the WarGames match on February 24 at WrestleWar. The Horsemen amicably split in April, during which time he entered negotiations with the WWF. Despite a huge contract offer and a promise of a world championship run, Eudy announced his intentions to leave WCW. Eudy left WCW after his match with El Gigante on May 19, 1991, at SuperBrawl I.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1991–1992) ===
At a &quot;Superstars&quot; taping on May 28, 1991, Eudy made his WWF debut in an untelevised segment, attacking The Mountie following Mountie&#x27;s open offer. On the June 8 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, vignettes began airing promoting his WWF debut and introducing him as Sid Justice. Sid made his debut on WWF television on the July 20 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;. On August 26 at SummerSlam, he served as the guest referee in a handicap match pitting The Ultimate Warrior and the WWF Champion Hulk Hogan against The Triangle of Terror (Sgt. Slaughter, Col. Mustafa, and Gen. Adnan). Later that night, Sid saved Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth from an attack at the hands of Jake Roberts and The Undertaker at the newly wed couple&#x27;s reception. During this time, Sid defeated Kato in his first televised match on the September 21 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;.

Sid competed for the vacant WWF Championship in the Royal Rumble match on January 19, 1992. Sid entered at No. 29 and was among the final four wrestlers, along with Hogan, Randy Savage, and Ric Flair, before he eliminated both Savage and then Hogan, leaving himself and Flair in the ring. Hogan, who was still at ringside after being eliminated, grabbed Sid&#x27;s arm and tried to pull him over the top rope, giving Flair the chance to grab Sid&#x27;s legs and throw him out to win the match and become the new WWF Champion. Less than a week later, on the January 25 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, WWF President Jack Tunney held a press conference to determine Flair&#x27;s opponent at WrestleMania VIII. Before Tunney revealed his decision, Sid stood up as if Tunney called his name. Yet to Sid&#x27;s annoyance, Tunney chose Hogan, giving a menacing glance in Hogan&#x27;s direction and calling Tunney&#x27;s decision &quot;bogus&quot;. Sid later apologized to Hogan and teamed up with him to face The Undertaker and Flair on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXX&quot;. During the match, after he double clotheslined Undertaker and Flair, Hogan reached to Sid for a tag. Sid refused and walked out of the match, turning heel in the process. Hogan won the match by disqualification.

On the February 23 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, Sid appeared as a guest on Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake&#x27;s &quot;The Barber Shop&quot;. Knowing that Hulk Hogan (Beefcake&#x27;s long-time real-life friend) was not in the arena, Sid threatened Beefcake and chased him off the set before destroying the Barber Shop with a chair. Later that night, Hogan was scheduled to battle Sid (and not WWF Champion Ric Flair) at WrestleMania VIII. Sid acquired Harvey Wippleman as his manager and began a post-match gimmick where he would further (kayfabe) injure his defeated opponents with one or more powerbombs, and sometimes–after the defeated wrestler placed on a stretcher–following it up by grabbing the stretcher and running it into a fixture, such as a ring post or guardrail. Prior to his WrestleMania match with Hogan, Sid failed a drug test. He was allowed to do the match and then went on their European tour, after which he was told he was going to serve his suspension. At WrestleMania VIII on April 5, Sid lost to Hogan by disqualification when Wippleman jumped into the ring to get involved. After the match, Sid and Papa Shango attacked Hogan until the returning Ultimate Warrior stormed the ring and saved Hogan.

After WrestleMania, Sid was about to embark on a feud with The Ultimate Warrior, the story being that Sid was angry at the Warrior for saving Hogan at WrestleMania VIII. Eudy wrestled Warrior at two house shows, both of which Warrior won by disqualification. After wrestling Warrior in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 26, Eudy voluntarily quit the company due to disagreements with the Warrior and WWF management in particular about the outcome of his match with Warrior. The WWF replaced Sid with Papa Shango in the feud with Warrior.

=== Return to WCW (1993) ===
On May 23, 1993, Eudy, under his Sid Vicious ring name, returned to WCW as a mystery competitor of Col. Robert Parker against Van Hammer at Slamboree. That summer, he teamed with Big Van Vader and reignited his feud with Sting. On September 19 at Fall Brawl, Sting&#x27;s team (Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster) defeated Sid&#x27;s team (Sid, Vader, and Harlem Heat) in a WarGames match. At Halloween Havoc on October 24, Sid faced Sting but was defeated via a roll-up.

After this, Sid turned face and was scheduled to challenge then WCW World Heavyweight Champion Vader at Starrcade and win the title. Before this could happen, Sid was released from his contract due to an altercation with Arn Anderson during a WCW tour of Europe. Eudy and Anderson were involved in an argument at a hotel bar in the English town of Blackburn on October 27, 1993. Anderson threatened Eudy with a broken bottle; after being sent to their rooms by security chief Doug Dillinger, Eudy came to Anderson&#x27;s room and attacked him with a chair leg, and Anderson retaliated with a pair of scissors. Eudy received four stab wounds and Anderson received 20, losing a pint and a half of blood in the process. The fight was broken up by fellow wrestler 2 Cold Scorpio, who was credited with saving Anderson&#x27;s life. Neither man pressed charges against the other, and British police declined to do so since both men would soon be leaving the country.

=== United States Wrestling Association (1994–1996) ===
After his departure from WCW, Sid moved to the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in Memphis, where he began feuding with old rival Jerry Lawler. On July 16, 1994, he won the promotion&#x27;s Unified World Heavyweight Championship by forfeit when Lawler, who had been attacked and injured by Sid earlier in the card, could not appear for the scheduled match. While Lawler was able to defeat Eudy in non-title matches, Sid was able to retain his title in several championship defenses through screwjobs initiated by The Spellbinder, his ally at the time. Sid also participated in the UWF Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994, challenging &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams for the UWF World Heavyweight Championship. On February 6, 1995, Lawler won the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship back from Sid. Sid regained the title from Lawler on August 30, 1996, before relinquishing the title back to Lawler on September 2.

=== Return to WWF (1995–1997) ===

==== Alliance with Shawn Michaels and Million Dollar Corporation (1995) ====

On the February 20, 1995 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; Eudy-now under the moniker &quot;Psycho Sid&quot; (later changed to &quot;Sycho Sid&quot;)-entered the WWF as the bodyguard of Shawn Michaels. Along with Jenny McCarthy, Sid accompanied Michaels to ringside for Michaels&#x27;s WWF Championship match against then-champion and Michaels&#x27;s former bodyguard, Diesel, at WrestleMania XI. Michaels had hit his signature Superkick, but Sid stood on the ring apron and distracted referee Earl Hebner, allowing Diesel time to recover and pin Michaels after a Jackknife Powerbomb to win the match and retain his title. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels expressed dissatisfaction with Sid&#x27;s interference and gave him the night off for his rematch against Diesel. In response, Sid yelled at Shawn and attacked Michaels from behind before hitting him with a powerbomb three times, turning Michaels into a face again.
Two weeks later on the April 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Ted DiBiase introduced Sid as the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the Million Dollar Corporation. Sid challenged Diesel to a match for the WWF Championship at the first In Your House pay-per-view on May 14, where Diesel won the match via disqualification, and thus retained his title, when Tatanka interfered. After the match, Sid and Tatanka continued to double-team Diesel until Bam Bam Bigelow came out to save him. At King of the Ring on June 15, Sid and Tatanka lost to Diesel and Bigelow. On July 23, Sid faced Diesel once again at In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks for the WWF Championship in a lumberjack match, which Diesel won to end the feud. Following this, Sid moved on to a feud with Shawn Michaels and was scheduled to face him at SummerSlam, but was replaced by Razor Ramon at the request of WWF President Gorilla Monsoon, with Ramon challenging for Michaels&#x27; Intercontinental Championship in a ladder match as Sid was seen watching on the backstage television monitors. On the September 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Sid faced Michaels for the title but lost after being hit with three superkicks. Sid then started a brief feud with Henry Godwinn, culminating in a victory over Godwinn on September 24 at In Your House 3: Triple Header.
On the November 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Sid faced Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon in a non-title match, with Ramon&#x27;s friend The 1–2–3 Kid as the special guest referee. Razor was about to deliver the Razor&#x27;s Edge on Sid, but The 1–2–3 Kid helped Sid avoid it, allowing Sid to pin Ramon after a powerbomb, with the Kid making a fast count. After the match, the Kid turned heel and joined the Million Dollar Corporation. In the first elimination match at Survivor Series on November 19, Sid and Corporation leader Ted DiBiase helped The 1–2–3 Kid pin Marty Jannetty to win and become the sole survivor for his team. Later in the event, Sid was randomly teamed up with his rival Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, and The British Bulldog to face Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Razor Ramon, and Dean Douglas in a &quot;Wild Card&quot; Survivor Series match. Sid was eliminated by Razor Ramon after Michaels hit Sid with a superkick. After his elimination, Sid powerbombed Michaels. On December 17 at In Your House 5: Seasons Beatings, Razor Ramon and Marty Jannetty defeated Sid and The 1–2–3 Kid. Sid and The 1–2–3 Kid teamed up the next night to participate in the first-ever Raw Bowl, which The Smoking Gunns won. Shortly after, he left the WWF, claiming a neck injury.

==== WWF Champion (1996–1997) ====
Eudy was not seen again until the July 8, 1996 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Under the Sycho Sid variation of his Sid gimmicks, Eudy was a strident-voiced and intense character, prone to erratically unstable mannerisms, such as in his random contemplative stares off into the distance, excessive eye-blinking, laughter turned sudden seriousness, and menacing fist bumps with fans during entrances. In his return, he replaced The Ultimate Warrior (who left the WWF) for a six-man tag team match, teaming with former rival Shawn Michaels and Ahmed Johnson against Vader, Owen Hart, and The British Bulldog in the main event of In Your House 9: International Incident on July 21, effectively making him a face. Sid&#x27;s team lost the match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Sid started a feud with The British Bulldog, whom he defeated at SummerSlam on August 18.

At In Your House 10: Mind Games on September 22, during the WWF Championship match between Michaels and Mankind, Michaels went for the pinfall on Mankind until Vader came out, broke up the count and attacked him, which got Mankind disqualified. After the match, Mankind and Vader double-teamed Michaels until Sid came out to make the save and brawled with Vader backstage. On October 20 at In Your House 11: Buried Alive, Sid defeated Vader despite interference from his manager Jim Cornette, earning a match against Michaels for the WWF Championship at Survivor Series.

On November 17 at Survivor Series, Sid grabbed a camera from the operator and prepared to hit Michaels with it. Michaels&#x27; manager, Jose Lothario, got on the ring apron and told Sid to put the camera down, but he refused and hit Lothario in the chest with it instead. Although this was the act of a heel, the audience cheered wildly for him and booed Michaels, just as they had done, in Sid&#x27;s favor, four and a half years earlier against Hogan at the Royal Rumble. After dropping the camera and turning around, Michaels hit him with the Sweet Chin Music, then went outside the ring to check on his manager instead of going for the pin. Sid hit Michaels in the back with the camera, then threw him back in the ring before hitting him with a powerbomb to win the WWF Championship. At In Your House 12: It&#x27;s Time on December 15, Sid defended the title against Bret Hart. Hart made Sid tap out to the Sharpshooter, but the referee was knocked out and unable to witness the submission. As Michaels was commentating at ringside, Sid and Hart left the ring and started fighting right beside him. After Sid had pushed Michaels and then climbed into the ring with Hart, Michaels went to hit Sid but the latter threw Hart into him. He then pinned him after a powerbomb to retain the title.

At the Royal Rumble on January 19, 1997, Sid lost the WWF Championship to Michaels. During the match, Sid hit the chokeslam on Michaels and repeatedly powerbombed him outside the ring. Jose Lothario got on the ring apron and was approached by Sid, but before he could do anything to him, Michaels hit Sid in the back and the face with the camera, knocking him out. Michaels went for the pin, but Sid managed to kick out, only for Michaels to hit him with Sweet Chin Music to win the championship. After Michaels forfeited that same title three weeks later, a four corners elimination title match was held for the vacant championship between Bret Hart, The Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vader at In Your House 13: Final Four on February 16, which Hart won. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Sid fought Hart for the championship. During the match, Hart had Sid trapped in the Sharpshooter submission when Austin, whom Hart was feuding with, came to the outside of the ring and hit Hart with a steel chair, allowing Sid to hit Hart with the powerbomb to win the WWF Championship for the second time. Sid successfully defended the title against Mankind and Hart in a steel cage match on the March 3 and 17 episodes of &quot;Raw&quot;, respectively.

At WrestleMania 13 on March 23, Sid lost the WWF Championship to The Undertaker after interference from Hart. He was scheduled to wrestle Hart at the April In Your House and Mankind in May, before both matches were cancelled. He returned on the June 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he failed to regain the title from the Undertaker. At King of the Ring on June 8, Sid and The Legion of Doom lost to The Hart Foundation (Owen Hart, The British Bulldog, and Jim Neidhart) in a six-man tag team match after Owen pinned Sid with a roll-up. Sid defeated Owen the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; before disappearing from television for over a month, making a brief final appearance on July 14. He was released by the WWF once again in the summer to recover from a neck injury.

=== Indie circuit and Extreme Championship Wrestling (1998–99) ===
After being inactive for nearly a year, Sid wrestled on the independent circuit in Mississippi and New Jersey. He defeated King Kong Bundy at the Eddie Gilbert Memorial Brawl on February 28, 1998. Eudy debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in January 1999, where he had matches with The Dudley Boyz, John Kronus, Skull Von Krush and Justin Credible. He left ECW in May due to the monetary problems plaguing the promotion.

=== Second return to WCW (1999–2001) ===

==== The Millennium Man and United States Heavyweight Champion (1999) ====
Eudy returned to WCW at The Great American Bash in on June 13, 1999, joining Randy Savage&#x27;s heel stable Team Madness. Upon his return, he took the nickname of &quot;The Millennium Man&quot; and faced the WCW World Champion Kevin Nash on the July 5, 1999, episode of &quot;WCW Nitro&quot;. Sid was dubbed as undefeated having a winning streak much like Goldberg had previously; although, the majority of this streak was due to Sid coming to the ring and power bombing wrestlers already in a match or immediately following their match and thus &quot;defeating&quot; them.

On September 12, Sid won his first and only WCW United States Heavyweight Championship from Chris Benoit at Fall Brawl. He then began a feud with Goldberg, who challenged him for the United States Heavyweight Championship on October 24 at Halloween Havoc. Earlier that night, their backstage fighting led Sid to require stitches, though he refused to be treated, which led to Sid bleeding openly the entire night. After brawling with Goldberg, a weary Sid lost the match due to excessive bleeding, awarding Goldberg the title against his opponent&#x27;s will. Sid lost again to Goldberg in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Mayhem on November 21, effectively ending their feud and Sid&#x27;s &quot;streak.&quot; WCW later released a VHS home video highlighting Sid&#x27;s return to WCW called &quot;Sid Vicious: Millennium Man&quot;.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2000) ====
Sid turned face after the &quot;Millennium Man&quot; gimmick ran dry. He was placed in a match at Souled Out on January 16, 2000, to fill the suddenly vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship after Bret Hart was forced to relinquish it due to a concussion. Sid lost to Chris Benoit, but the title was again vacated as Benoit left for the WWF the next day. The on-screen explanation was that Sid&#x27;s foot was under the rope during his submission loss. On January 24, Sid was presented with a challenge by Nash, who had become commissioner of WCW. If he could beat Don and Ron Harris on &quot;Nitro&quot; that night, he would face Nash for the championship that night. Sid defeated the Harris Brothers and eventually Nash himself to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Two nights later on &quot;Thunder&quot;, Nash stripped Sid of the championship due to him not beating the legal Harris brother in the match on &quot;Nitro&quot;. Later that night, Sid defeated Nash in a Caged Heat match to win the title for a second time. On February 20, he retained the title at SuperBrawl in a three-way match against Scott Hall and Jeff Jarrett.

At Uncensored on March 19, Sid successfully defended his title against Jarrett with help from a returning Hulk Hogan. On the following night&#x27;s &quot;Nitro&quot;, during a tag team match pitting Sid and Hogan against Jarrett and Scott Steiner, Sid turned heel and attacked Hogan, due to him being incensed that the fans were chanting Hogan&#x27;s name. He chokeslammed Hogan and forced the referee to count Hogan being pinned, although the official result was a no contest. Shortly after this, WCW began its New Blood angle and on April 10, Sid (along with all the other WCW champions at the time) was stripped of his championship. He did not play a large role in the angle that followed, and was kept off of television for several months.

==== Injury and first retirement (2000–2001) ====
Sid returned on the November 27 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, revealing himself as the challenger for Scott Steiner&#x27;s WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Starrcade. At Starrcade on December 17, Sid failed to win the title.

On January 14, 2001, at the Sin pay-per-view in Indianapolis at Conseco Fieldhouse (now Gainbridge Fieldhouse), Sid faced Steiner, Jeff Jarrett and Road Warrior Animal in a Four Corners match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, he had a near career-ending injury. WCW executive John Laurinaitis allegedly felt that Eudy needed to broaden his arsenal of wrestling moves and suggested that he try an aerial maneuver, despite his unwillingness and disbelief that a wrestler of his shape should do highspots. His leg fractured following a leap from the second turnbuckle in an attempted big boot on Steiner. This had him awkwardly landing with all his weight on one foot while kicking with the other, severely fracturing the leg on which he landed. Eudy broke his left leg in half, snapping both the tibia and fibula, with at least one of the bones breaking through the skin and rotating his foot without his input at 90 degrees anti-clockwise. The fracture was too graphic for many television stations to re-air, although it was shown on the following &quot;Nitro&quot;.

The injury put Sid out of action indefinitely, and he pondered retiring from wrestling for good: &quot;I had about a year left on my contract, and I was thinking back then prior to hurting my leg what was I going to do as far as wrapping up my career. The only thing I really wanted to do was ideally go out in a big pay-per-view, like a WrestleMania or something like that main event, leave like that, and not come back again. It would really be the retirement match&quot;. A 17-inch (43 cm) rod was placed in his leg during the two-hour surgery. Sid later sued WCW, claiming that he was made to jump off the second rope against his objections. The injury forced a plot change in the SuperBrawl Revenge event. The main event was supposed to be Kevin Nash, Diamond Dallas Page, and Sid against Scott Steiner, Jeff Jarrett, and Road Warrior Animal but was rewritten as Kevin Nash against Scott Steiner. Sid left WCW, before WCW closed down the following month after the final episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; on March 26, 2001.

===Recovery and later career (2002–2017)===
After WCW was bought by the WWF in March 2001 and following surgery, Eudy was faced with the prospect of rehabilitation of his leg for three to five days per week for at least the next year. He was told by his doctor that he would never run again, and Sid set a goal of being able to do so. At first he was limited to using a cane, but through extensive effort he was able to not only walk again, but in time run. During his arduous rehabilitation, he made several appearances as World Wrestling All-Stars&#x27;s (WWA) commissioner during its 2002 Australian tour, though at the beginning of WWA&#x27;s Sydney show. Sid also filed a lawsuit with the Universal Wrestling Corporation (the Turner holding company for what remained of WCW&#x27;s unpurchased assets), seeking redress for the injury that he sustained. The judge ultimately ruled in favor of the UWC.

Eudy returned to active wrestling in 2004 with the Canadian-based Internet Wrestling Syndicate. On July 14, 2007, Eudy debuted in Memphis Wrestling and started a feud with old rival Jerry Lawler while serving as &quot;Hollywood&quot; Jimmy Blaylock&#x27;s enforcer. Sid appeared at the Juggalo Championship Wrestling event Evansville Invasion on October 6, helping Tracy Smothers attack the promotion&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion Corporal Robinson. On November 7, 2008, Sid faced Lawler in the main event of the &quot;Jerry Lawler 35th Anniversary Wrestling event&quot; at the Tennessee Fairgrounds, where he was defeated. On February 28, 2009, Eudy returned to Memphis Wrestling and won a battle royal before defeating Lawler in a rematch. Following this, Eudy&#x27;s appearances were greatly reduced as he began focusing on competition in over-50 bodybuilding. He did however appear in Mid Southern Championship Wrestling on August 18, 2009 in Osceola. There he teamed with Pokerface against Scott Hall &amp; Lord Humongous, the latter a revival of the gimmick formerly portrayed by Sid. In this match it marked the debut of Sid&#x27;s son Gunnar Eudy. Humongous and Hall won via disqualification after Sid hit the referee. Sid and Pokerface faced Humongous and Hall again in Jonesboro, AR on September 19, 2009, but again were defeated. 
Sid then wrestled three times in 2010 and 2011, defeating Chase Stevens, Josef von Schmidt, and Eddie Kingston.
On the June 25, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Eudy made his return to WWE as Sycho Sid in a match against Heath Slater, where he defeated Slater as part of the ongoing celebration building up to WWE&#x27;s 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. It was his first appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; since the July 14, 1997, episode and his first match on the show since June 9, 1997. Eudy would reappear at &quot;Raw 1000&quot; on July 23, where he and other WWE legends helped Lita take down Slater. 

On August 5, 2017, Sid wrestled the last match of his career defeating Paul Rosenberg in Ottawa, Ontario, for Great North Wrestling.

== Personal life ==
Eudy and his wife, Sabrina Paige (née Estes), were married on December 30, 1983, in Shelby County, Tennessee. Frank, a cast member on the CBS reality show &quot;Big Brother 14&quot; and &quot;18&quot;, and Gunnar Eudy, who is also a wrestler, are their sons. At the time of his death, Eudy lived with his wife in Marion, Arkansas.

Eudy was a fan of softball, which he briefly played during his time off from wrestling between 1997 and 1999.

In January 2011, Eudy was arrested in Shelby County. Initially pulled over for and charged with not wearing his seatbelt, Eudy was also charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana and driving without a license. He was later released on $1,000 bond.

==Death==
On August 26, 2024, Eudy died of cancer, specifically non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, at the age of 63. Previously, he had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation. That night, a video package paying tribute to Eudy aired during an episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, with Damian Priest paying tribute by claiming during an in ring segment with Rhea Ripley &quot;we are the masters and rulers of this world&quot; before they each simultaneously performed Sid&#x27;s trademark chokeslam and powerbomb.

==Other media==
Eudy made an appearance in the 2000 film &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; alongside David Arquette and Scott Caan. In 2011, he starred alongside fellow wrestlers Kurt Angle and Kevin Nash in the horror movie &quot;River of Darkness&quot;. He starred in the 2011 horror film &quot;Death from Above&quot;, alongside fellow wrestlers Kurt Angle, James Storm, Matt Morgan, Terry Gerin, and Jessica Kresa. On August 2, 2012, he appeared on the CBS reality show &quot;Big Brother 14&quot; in which his son, Frank, was a contestant.

Eudy was a playable character in the NES version of &quot;WWF WrestleMania: Steel Cage Challenge&quot;, the Game Boy game &quot;WWF Superstars 2&quot; and the SNES version of &quot;WWF Super Wrestlemania&quot;. For WCW he appeared in &quot;WCW Backstage Assault&quot;. He was a playable character in both &quot;Legends of Wrestling II&quot; and &quot;&quot; as well.

Eudy appears as Sycho Sid in &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;, as downloadable content. Sid is part of the roster in &quot;WWE 2K18&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K19&quot;.

A photo of Eudy in the ring features on the cover art of the Westside Gunn album &quot;Still Praying&quot;.

<text>Richard Masur (born November 20, 1948) is an American character actor who has appeared in more than 40 films. From 1995 to 1999, he served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). He is best known for playing David Kane on &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; (1975–1976), Nick Lobo on &quot;Rhoda&quot; (1974–1977), Clark in &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), adult Stanley Uris in the miniseries &quot;It&quot; (1990), and Edward L. L. Moore on &quot;Younger&quot; (2016–2018).

==Life and career==

Masur was born in New York City to Jewish parents: a high school counselor mother, Claire Masur, and a pharmacist father, Jesse Masur. He has a sister, Judith Masur. He attended P.S. 28, Walt Whitman Junior High School, and Roosevelt High School, Yonkers, New York. He is married to Eileen Henry.

Masur studied at the Yale School of Drama toward an MFA in acting and appeared on stage before acting in movies and television shows during the 1970s. He appeared on an episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot; as well as in an episode of &quot;The Waltons&quot; in 1974, and had recurring roles in &quot;Rhoda&quot; from 1974 to 1977; &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; from 1975 to 1976; &quot;Hot l Baltimore&quot; in 1975; and the pilot to an NBC sitcom, &quot;Bumpers&quot;, in 1977. In 1981, Masur played the role of a child molestor armed with a camera in the television film &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;.

Masur played the role of a character modeled after Jewish American spy Jonathan Pollard in the film &quot;Les Patriotes (The Patriots)&quot; (1994), by French director Éric Rochant.

In January 2006, Masur began appearing as a recurring character on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. He has also appeared in guest spots on many TV shows, including &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Kevin (Probably) Saves the World&quot;, &quot;All In The Family&quot;, and &quot;Transparent&quot;.

<text>Arrochar () is a neighborhood in northeastern Staten Island in New York City in the United States. It is located directly inland of Fort Wadsworth and South Beach, on the east side of Hylan Boulevard south of the Staten Island Expressway; the community of Grasmere borders it on the west. It is today primarily a neighborhood of one- and two-family homes and small businesses.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the late 17th century Staten Island, the area was the site of a Lenape encampment. The name &quot;Arrochar&quot; comes from the estate of William Wallace MacFarland in the 1840s, who named it for his hometown of Arrochar in Scotland, the seat of the ancient chiefs of the Clan MacFarlane.

At the beginning of the 20th century the neighborhood became a fashionable gateway to the resort communities of South Beach and Midland Beach. The house of the MacFarland estate is now part of the grounds of St. Joseph Hill Academy, a Catholic girls school. Across Landis Avenue from St. Joseph Hill Academy sits St. John Villa Academy, a now-defunct all-girls Catholic high school. Throughout the 20th century it became a residential neighborhood for various ethnic groups, Italian-Americans being chief among them. Arrochar today is still inhabited by many Italians and has a growing Chinese-American community as well.

==Education==
Arrochar is served by the elementary school P.S.39 and St. Joseph Hill Academy (which is both elementary and high school).

==Transportation==
Arrochar once had its own train station, on the South Beach Branch of the Staten Island Railway. The station was located at Major Avenue.
This station was abandoned when the SIRT discontinued passenger service on the South Beach Branch to Wentworth Avenue at midnight on March 31, 1953, because of city-operated bus competition. The tracks of the South Beach line have been removed and homes now stand on its former right-of-way.

Due to its proximity to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Arrochar is served by the express buses to and from Manhattan; the buses to and from Brooklyn; and the intra-borough buses.

<text>The German Football Association ( ; DFB ) is the governing body of football, futsal, and beach soccer in Germany. A founding member of both FIFA and UEFA, the DFB has jurisdiction for the German football league system and is in charge of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams. The DFB headquarters are in Frankfurt am Main. Sole members of the DFB are the German Football League (; DFL), organising the professional Bundesliga and the 2. Bundesliga, along with five regional and 21 state associations, organising the semi-professional and amateur levels. The 21 state associations of the DFB have a combined number of more than 25,000 clubs with more than 6.8 million members, making the DFB the single largest sports federation in the world.

== History ==


=== 1875 to 1900 ===
From 1875 to the mid-1880s, the first kind of football played in Germany was according to rugby rules. Later, association-style football teams formed separate clubs, and since 1890, they began to organise on regional and national levels.

=== 1900 to 1933 ===
The DFB (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) was founded on 28 January 1900 in Leipzig by representatives of 86 clubs. The vote held to establish the association was 62:22 in favour (84 votes). Some delegates present represented more than one club, but may have voted only once. Other delegates present did not carry their club&#x27;s authority to cast a ballot. Ferdinand Hueppe, the representative of DFC Prague, was named its first president. The DFB consolidated the large number of state-based German regional competitions in play for a single recognized national title for the season 1902/03. Germans were not present in Paris when FIFA was founded by seven nations in May 1904, but by the time the FIFA statutes came into effect on 1 September, Germany had also joined by telegram as the eighth nation. The German national team played its first game in 1908.

Before 1914, the German Empire was much larger than today&#x27;s Germany, comprising Alsace-Lorraine and the eastern provinces. The borders of the regional associations were drawn according to suitable railway connections. Also, teams based in Bohemia, then part of Austria-Hungary, were eligible, as they were German Football clubs and thus considered German. Thus, a German team from Prague was runner-up in the German championship. On the other hand, clubs of the Danish minority in Northern Schleswig refused to join the DFB. This area after World War I voted to join Denmark. Due to border changes imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, the DFB had to adapt its structure. The Saarland, Danzig, and the Memelland were detached from Germany and East Prussia was cut off from the main part by the Polish Corridor.

=== 1933 to 1945 ===
The role of DFB and its representatives like Felix Linnemann under Nazi Germany was documented in &quot;100 Jahre DFB&quot; and by Nils Havemann in &quot;Fußball unterm Hakenkreuz&quot;. According to &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; policy, the DFB, with its large membership from all political sides, and strong regional structures compared to weak national ones, submitted to new rulers and new Gau structures. On a short general meeting on 9 July 1933 in Berlin, the DFB did so, at least formally.

Later, the Hitler salute was made compulsory; Marxists and Jews were expelled. The records of German Jews were erased from the DFB&#x27;s records, such as those of Gottfried Fuchs who had scored a world record ten goals for Germany in a 16–0 win against Russia at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, becoming the top scorer of the tournament and setting an international record. When, in 1972, German former player and national team coach Sepp Herberger asked the German Football Association vice president Hermann Neuberger to invite Fuchs as a guest or a guest of honour to an international against Russia on the 60th anniversary of Fuchs&#x27; performance for the German team, the DFB Executive Committee declined to do so, writing that it was not willing to invite Fuchs because it would have created an unfortunate precedent (as was pointed out, given that Fuchs was the last remaining former Jewish German international, the DFB&#x27;s concern about creating a precedent was a difficult one to understand). As of 2016, Fuchs was still the top German scorer for one match.

A new organization, Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen (German Reich League for Physical Exercise), was established and Linnemann was appointed leader of its &quot;Fachamt Fußball&quot; (Football section), which took over the operational affairs, whereas the DFB lost most of its duties until it was formally dissolved in 1940.

On the pitch, Germany had done well in 1934, but after a 0–2 loss to Norway in the quarter finals of the 1936 Summer Olympics, with Adolf Hitler attending, the DFB and football fell from grace. &quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot; Baldur von Schirach and the Hitler Youth took over youth football (under 16) from the clubs following a deal with &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; Hans von Tschammer und Osten, who had been in charge of all sports in Germany since 1933, making DFB officials even more powerless. Germany had made a bid to host the 1938 World Cup, but it was withdrawn without comment.

Following the Anschluss in March 1938 that made Austria part of Germany, the Austrian Football Association became part of the German federation. New coach Sepp Herberger was told on short notice to use also Austrian players in his team, which was eliminated in the first round of the World Cup, weakening the situation of football within the Nazi politics to near meaninglessness. Four Germans (Hans Jakob, Albin Kitzinger, Ludwig Goldbrunner, and Ernst Lehner) represented West Europe in a FIFA friendly on 20 June 1937 in Amsterdam, and another two (Kitzinger again and Anderl Kupfer) represented a FIFA continental team on 26 October 1938 in London, England. During the war, Germany played international games until 1942.

=== 1945 to 1963 ===
In the aftermath of World War II, German organisations were disbanded by the allies. FIFA decided in November 1945 to ban the no longer existing DFB (and Japan&#x27;s football association) from international competition, while the Austrian association was re-founded. Internationally, Germans were still represented, with Zürich-based Ivo Schricker serving as General Secretary of FIFA from 1932 to December 1950. In 1948, Switzerland requested FIFA to lift the ban on games against Germans, but this was denied. Swiss clubs played German clubs anyway, but had to cease doing so due to international protests. This was only changed in 1949 when The Football Association requested FIFA to lift the ban on club games. FIFA did so on 7 May 1949, two weeks before the Federal Republic of Germany was founded, thus games required permission by the military governments of the time.
Due to partition into several occupation zones, and states, the DFB was legally re-founded in Stuttgart on 21 January 1950 only by the West German regional associations, without the Saarland Football Association in the French occupied Saarland, which on 12 June 1950 would be recognized by FIFA as the first of three German FAs after the war. At the FIFA congress held on 22 June prior to the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the Swiss Football Association requested that the DFB be reinstated with full FIFA membership, which was granted on 22 September 1950 in Brussels. Thus, Germany was excluded from the 1950 FIFA World Cup and could resume international games only in late 1950.

In the early years of the division of Germany, West Germany claimed exclusive mandate of all of Germany. Unlike the IOC, which granted only provisional recognition to the East Germans in 1955, demanding they participate in an All-German Olympic team (United Team of Germany), FIFA fully recognized the East German Football Association in 1952. Winning the 1954 World Cup was a major success for the DFB, and the popularity of the sport in Germany.

The teams of the DFB and the Saarland were squared off in the qualifiers for the 1954 World Cup before the Saarland and its FA was permitted to rejoin Germany and the DFB in 1956.

=== 1963 to present ===
Due to that success, and due to regional associations fearing to lose influence, the old amateur structure, in which five regional leagues represented the top level, remained in effect longer than in many other countries, even though a &quot;Reichsliga&quot; had been proposed decades ago. Also, professionalism was rejected, and players who played abroad were considered &quot;mercenaries&quot; and not capped. The conservative attitude changed only after disappointing results in the 1962 FIFA World Cup when officials like the 75-year-old Peco Bauwens retired. According to the proposals of Hermann Neuberger, the DFB finally introduced a single nationwide professional league, the Bundesliga, for the 1963–64 season.

The DFB has hosted the World Cup in 1974 and 2006. Germany also hosted the European Championship in 1988 as well as in 2024. Upon reunification in 1990, the East German Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR (DFV) was absorbed into the DFB along its honours.

The national team won the World Cup for a second time in 1974, a third time in 1990, and a fourth in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Also, they were crowned European champions three times, in 1972, in 1980 and in 1996. On top, the &quot;Mannschaft&quot; were runners-up in the 1966, 1982, 1986 and 2002 World Cups and in 1976, 1992 and 2008 European Championships, making it the second-most successful national team in the world as well as the most successful national team in Europe.

The DFB has also overseen the rise of Germany as a world power in women&#x27;s football. The national team has won World Cups in 2003 and 2007—the latter without conceding a goal in the final tournament, making them the only World Cup champions for men or women to do so. Furthermore, the women&#x27;s national team&#x27;s victory in 2003 made Germany the only nation to have won both the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s World Cups, until Spain achieved the same milestone in 2023. They have also won eight UEFA Women&#x27;s Championships, including the last six in succession.

In 1990, mere months before reunification became official, the DFB founded the women&#x27;s Bundesliga (&quot;Frauen-Bundesliga&quot;), directly modelled after the men&#x27;s Bundesliga. Initially, it was played in north and south divisions but became a single league in 1997. Bundesliga teams have enjoyed more success in the UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League than those from any other nation; four different clubs have won a total of nine titles, with the most recent being 2015 champions 1. FFC Frankfurt, now known as Eintracht Frankfurt.

Since 2005, in memory of former German-Jewish Olympian international footballer Julius Hirsch who was killed in Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust, the German Football Federation awards the &quot;Julius-Hirsch-Preis&quot; for outstanding examples of integration and tolerance within German football.
== Critics ==

The main criticisms of the DFB are the lack of transparency and the commercialization of football, which has been strongly promoted by DFB officials.

Christian Prechtl, from the fan organization &quot; FC PlayFair!&quot;, mentioned that the growing unpopularity of the men&#x27;s national team is &quot;just a perfect example of what can happen when you have the fans out of sight&quot;.

== Structure ==
=== Members ===
Direct members of the DFB are only its five regional associations and its 21 state associations, along with the German Football League, whereas the clubs participating in the German football league system are members of the state associations covering their district. Today, more than 25,000 clubs are organised in those state associations, fielding nearly 170,000 teams with over two million active players and totalling over six million members, the largest membership of any single sports federation in the world. The Association governs 870,000 male members and 8,600 female teams.

=== Regional and state associations ===
The DFB is organised into five regional associations, which themselves are sub-divided into 21 state associations. These associations typically have their boundaries run along the borders of the German states, with the exception of some states (North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Baden-Württemberg) having up to three state associations covering different areas of such state.

==== Southern Germany ====
The Southern German Football Association ( &quot;SFV&quot;) covers the states of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse. The &quot;SFV&quot;, formed on 17 October 1897 under the name of &quot;Verband Süddeutscher Fußball-Vereine&quot;, originally administered the Southern German football championship, until it was dissolved by the Nazis in 1933. Reformed in the American occupation zone after the Second World War, it operated the Oberliga Süd, the regional division of the former top level German Oberliga until the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963. Since the 2012–13 season, the &quot;SFV&quot;, except its member Bavarian FA, along with the &quot;Football Association of the Southwest&quot; is in charge of the Regionalliga Südwest, a step 4 division in the German football league system. The &quot;SFV&quot; itself is formed by the following state associations: 
* Baden Football Association ( &quot;BFV&quot;)
* Bavarian Football Association ( &quot;BFV&quot;)
* Hessian Football Association ( &quot;HFV&quot;)
* South Baden Football Association ( &quot;SBFV&quot;)
* Württemberg Football Association ( &quot;WFV&quot;)

==== Southwestern Germany ====
The Southwestern Regional Football Association ( &quot;FRVS&quot;) covers the states Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland and was formed after the Second World War in the French occupation zone in Germany. Its highest league until the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963 was the Oberliga Südwest, the regional division of the former top level German Oberliga. Since the 2012–13 season, the &quot;FRVS&quot;, along with the &quot;Southern German football association&quot; is in charge of Regionalliga Südwest, a step 4 division in the German football league system. Additionally, the &quot;FRVS&quot; administers the Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar, a step 5 division. The &quot;FRVS&quot; itself is formed by the following state associations:
* Rhineland Football Association ( &quot;FVR&quot;)
* Saarland Football Association ( &quot;SFV&quot;)
* Southwest German Football Association ( &quot;SWFV&quot;)

==== Western Germany ====
The Western German Football Association ( &quot;WDFV&quot;) covers the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The association was known as &quot;WFLV&quot; from 2002 to 2016 and used to administer the Western German football championship until 1933. From 1947 to 1963, its highest league was the Oberliga West, the regional division of the former top level German Oberliga. Since the 2008–09 season, the &quot;WDFV&quot; is in charge of the Regionalliga West, a step 4 division in the German football league system. The &quot;WDFV&quot; itself is formed by the following state associations:
* Middle Rhine Football Association ( &quot;FVM&quot;)
* Lower Rhine Football Association ( &quot;FVN&quot;)
* Westphalia Football and Athletics Association ( &quot;FLVW&quot;)

==== Northern Germany ====

The association used to administer the Northern German football championship until 1933. From 1947 to 1963, its highest league was the Oberliga Nord, the regional division of the former top level German Oberliga. Since the 1994–95 season, the &quot;NFV&quot; is in charge of the Regionalliga Nord, a step 4 division in the German football league system. The &quot;NFV&quot; itself is formed by the following state associations:
* Bremen Football Association ( &quot;BFV&quot;)
* Hamburg Football Association ( &quot;HFV&quot;)
* Lower Saxony Football Association ( &quot;NFV&quot;)
* Schleswig-Holstein Football Association ( &quot;SHFV&quot;)

==== Northeastern Germany ====
The Northeastern German Football Association ( &quot;NOFV&quot;) covers the states of Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. The association is the youngest of the five regional associations, having been formed after German reunification in 1990 as a successor of the disbanded &quot;German Football Association of the GDR&quot;. Since the 2012–13 season and previously from 1994 to 2000, the &quot;NOFV&quot; administers the Regionalliga Nordost, a step 4 division in the German football league system, and the step 5 Oberliga Nordost.

<doc id="690083" wikidata="Q2331393" url="?curid=690083" title="List of WWE Champions">
<text>The WWE Championship is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship in WWE, currently defended on the SmackDown brand. It was the first world title established in WWE, at the time known as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), having been introduced in 1963 as the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship. The WWWF, a National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territory, did not recognize Lou Thesz&#x27;s victory over reigning NWA champion Buddy Rogers and sought to create its own world title upon exiting the body. The WWWF rejoined the NWA in 1971; however, one of the caveats of rejoining is that the championship would no longer be recognised as a &quot;world championship&quot;, and only as a regional heavyweight championship. The promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979 and ended its affiliation with the (NWA) in 1983, with the title also renamed to reflect the changes; it regained its world championship status upon leaving the NWA. In 2001, it was unified with the World Championship and became the Undisputed WWF Championship. In 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and split its roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown. The title, now renamed the WWE Championship, was then designated to the SmackDown brand while WWE established an alternate world title known as the World Heavyweight Championship for the Raw brand. A third alternate world title, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, was reactivated for the ECW brand in 2006. It was vacated and decommissioned when the ECW brand disbanded in 2010.

When WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena at the pay-per-view event on December 15, 2013, in a Tables, ladders, and chairs match, the World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWE Championship, resulting in the retiring of the former, as well as the renaming of the latter to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On June 27, 2016, the name was shortened back to the WWE Championship, before assuming the WWE World Championship name on July 26, when the brand split returned. It became designated to the SmackDown brand and WWE again established an alternate world title known as the WWE Universal Championship for the Raw brand. In December 2016, WWE again shortened the title&#x27;s name back to WWE Championship. Since April 2022, the title has represented one-half of the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, with the other half represented by the Universal Championship, but both titles have retained their individual lineages. Under the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship moniker, the title was moved to SmackDown in the 2023 draft and Raw established a new World Heavyweight Championship as an alternative title.

The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. Some reigns were held by champions using a ring name while others use their real name. Cody Rhodes is the current champion in his first reign. He won the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship (WWE and Universal Championships) by defeating Roman Reigns in a Bloodline Rules match at WrestleMania XL Night 2 on April 7, 2024, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Following his win, the undisputed title&#x27;s name was truncated to Undisputed WWE Championship.

As of 18, 2025, there have been 147 recognized reigns between 55 recognized champions and 11 recognized vacancies (there are 4 reigns, 2 people, and 2 vacancies that are not recognized by the WWE). The first champion was Buddy Rogers, who was awarded the championship in 1963. The champion with the single longest reign is Bruno Sammartino with a reign of 2,803 days while the record for longest combined reign is also held by Sammartino at 4,040. John Cena has the most reigns with 13. Nine men in history have held the championship for a continuous reign of one year (365 days) or more: Bruno Sammartino (who achieved the feat on two occasions), Pedro Morales, Bob Backlund, Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, John Cena, CM Punk, AJ Styles, and Roman Reigns. Of those nine, four held the championship for a continuous reign of 1,000 days or more: Bruno Sammartino (who achieved the feat on two occasions), Pedro Morales, Bob Backlund and Hulk Hogan.

<doc id="690089" wikidata="Q913337" url="?curid=690089" title="Provinces of the Dominican Republic">
<text>The Dominican Republic is divided into thirty-one (provinces; singular ), while the national capital, Santo Domingo, is contained within its own Distrito Nacional (&quot;National District&quot;; &quot;D.N.&quot; on the map below).

The division of the country into provinces is laid down in the constitution (Title I, Section II, Article 5) and enacted by law. The latter is currently Law 5220 on the Territorial Division of the Dominican Republic (), issued 1959 and frequently amended to create new provinces and lower-level administrative units.

==The provinces as administrative divisions==

The provinces are the first-level administrative subdivisions of the country. The headquarters of the central government&#x27;s regional offices are normally found in the capital cities of provinces. The president appoints an administrative governor () for each province but not for the Distrito Nacional (Title IX of the constitution).

The provinces are divided into municipalities (), which are the second–level political and administrative subdivisions of the country.

The Distrito Nacional was created in 1936. Prior to this, the Distrito Nacional was the old Santo Domingo Province, in existence since the country&#x27;s independence in 1844. It is not to be confused with the new Santo Domingo Province, which split off from it in 2001. While it is similar to a province in many ways, the Distrito Nacional differs in its lack of an administrative governor and consisting only of one municipality, Santo Domingo, the city council () and mayor () which are in charge of its administration.

==The provinces as constituencies==
The provinces are also constituencies for the elections to the bicameral National Congress (). Each province elects one member of the Senate () and a guaranteed minimum of two members of the Chamber of Deputies ().

==Statistics==
The following is a table of the provinces and their capital cities. The population figures are from the 2021 population estimate.

<doc id="690092" wikidata="Q3778632" url="?curid=690092" title="Arrochar, Argyll">
<text>Arrochar ( ; or ) is a village at the head of Loch Long in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. The Arrochar Alps are named after the village. The village is within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.

==Geography==

Arrochar is overlooked by a group of mountains called the Arrochar Alps, part of the Grampian Mountain range. In particular by the distinctive rocky summit of the Cobbler.

The village enjoys good communications, located at the junction of the A83 and A814 roads and is served by Arrochar and Tarbet railway station. In addition the A82 road runs through Tarbet east.

==Arrochar Mountain Rescue Team==

The rescue team was setup in the mid 1950&#x27;s. The team has around thirty voluntary members on call 365 days a year.

==History==

Arrochar was Historically in the Dunbartonshire area, until boundary changes in 1996.

For over five centuries this area, the feudal barony of Arrochar, was held by the chiefs of Clan MacFarlane and before them by their ancestors the barons of Arrochar.
The family is Celtic in the male line.

The settlement was a key target for Viking raiders who took their boats a further overland to Tarbet to attack the unprotected inland settlements around the shores of Loch Lomond. In 1263 the Vikings where defeated at the battle of Largs.

===Royal Naval Torpedo Testing Station and Range===


The photograph shows the former torpedo testing facility at the head of Loch Long. Established in 1912 and decommissioned in 1980. The site is currently part demolished. Demolition has been stalled since a fire on the site in June 2007.

Torpedoes were fired up Loch Long from tubes at the front of the facility. A boat stood by to recover the (unarmed) torpedoes where they were returned for analysis. The now roofless shed to the left and the main part of the building have tracks where torpedoes were stored and worked on. Hoists on the first floor lowered the torpedoes into the tubes.

The control room at the top looking straight down the loch housed a camera. Behind the control room, above the loading shed, is office accommodation. The rest of the facility included housing and workshops but these have been sold off.

<doc id="690099" wikidata="Q1228607" url="?curid=690099" title="Discworld (video game)">
<text>Discworld is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Teeny Weeny Games and Perfect 10 Productions and published by Psygnosis. It is based on Terry Pratchett&#x27;s novels of the same name. Players assume the role of Rincewind the &quot;wizzard&quot;, voiced by Eric Idle, as he becomes involved in exploring the Discworld for the means to prevent a dragon terrorising the city of Ankh-Morpork. The game&#x27;s story borrows elements from several &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, with its central plot loosely based on the events in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;

Pratchett was originally reluctant to grant a licence for a game based on his novels, after the commercial failure of a video game adaptation of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; in 1986. Gregg Barnett, the game&#x27;s designer, managed to persuade the writer through offering, alongside an initial design concept, to faithfully recreate elements from the novels. As part of his desire for a large adventure for CD-based computer systems and opening up a new potential market for similar video games, he convinced Pratchett to create an original story that would offer a game based on the entire series rather than an adaptation of one book. Development included incorporating a British cast of comedians to voice several of the game&#x27;s characters.

The game was originally released in 1995 for MS-DOS, Macintosh and PlayStation, with a Sega Saturn version released the following year. &quot;Discworld&quot; proved more popular with European gamers than those in North America, with reviewers praising it for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, but criticising its gameplay and difficult puzzles. A sequel, &quot;Discworld II: Missing Presumed...!?&quot;, was released in 1996.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Discworld&quot; is a third-person point-and-click graphic adventure game. In each location in the game, players can examine and interact with people and objects, picking up and using items to acquire other objects or solve puzzles to remove obstacles. Conversations focus on Rincewind using one of four topics with characters: Greet; Sarcastic or Joking; Question; and Vent Anger. Additional topics may sometimes appear related to a subject that Rincewind learns during the course of the game, with the character interacting with a variety of people during the game, including the Archchancellor, Dibbler, the Librarian, and Death.

Items found in the game can be stored in one of two inventories: Rincewind&#x27;s pockets, which can store only four items at any one time; or in the Luggage. To progress the story, which is divided into four acts, Rincewind must find key items needed to advance, requiring visiting a multitude of locations; some around Ankh-Morpork, and other outside the city and around the Discworld, all of which are accessed via an overworld map for each region whenever the player leaves a location to visit another (some become accessible when players learn of them).

The PlayStation version is compatible with the PlayStation Mouse, as well as the standard PlayStation controller. The Japanese Sega Saturn version is also compatible with the Shuttle Mouse.

== Plot ==
A secret brotherhood summons a dragon from its native dimension, so as to cause destruction and mayhem across the city of Ankh-Morpork. Rumours of the dragon&#x27;s rampage across the city reaches Unseen University. Since the Archchancellor wishes the involvement of at least one wizard in the matter, Rincewind is summoned to handle the problem. After acquiring a book to learn what is needed to track the dragon to its lair, Rincewind searches the city for the various components needed to assemble a dragon detector and brings them back to the Archchancellor. After the Archchancellor lets slip that the dragon&#x27;s lair is stocked with gold, Rincewind snatches the dragon detector from him, searches the city, finds the lair, and takes all the gold within it. Just before he leaves, the dragon stops him and requests his aid in removing the brotherhood&#x27;s hold upon her, claiming they are using her for evil and are planning to make her go on a major rampage.

To do this, Rincewind is told to discover who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items are what they use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood&#x27;s hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds a role in the city – Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King – and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.

Learning that a hero with a million-to-one chance can stop it, Rincewind searches for the right components to be that hero, journeying across the city, the Disc, and even over the edge, to find the necessary items, including a sword that goes &quot;ting&quot;, a birthmark, and a magic spell. With the components acquired, he returns to the city&#x27;s square, where Lady Ramkin, the owner of a local dragon sanctuary, is tied to a rock to be sacrificed to the dragon. Despite having what is needed to combat the dragon, Rincewind fails to stop it, and so seeks out an alternative method. Taking a swamp dragon called Mambo the 16th, and feeding him hot coals and a lit firecracker, Rincewind tries again, but Mambo stops working when he becomes infatuated with the dragon. Rincewind then throws a love custard tart at the dragon. The dragon falls in love with Mambo, and the two fly off to perform mating dances. Rincewind heads to the pub for a pint to celebrate the end of his adventure.

== Development ==
Terry Pratchett was pleased with the 1986 interactive fiction game &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, but criticised its poor marketing. He was reluctant to grant &quot;Discworld&quot; licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company who cared about the property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and their failure to obtain a &quot;Discworld&quot; licence led to the creation of &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot;, which took inspiration from the &quot;Discworld&quot; series of books.

When the creative director and designer Gregg Barnett sought out the &quot;Discworld&quot; licence, he intended to show Pratchett that he cared about &quot;Discworld&quot;, rather than seeking money (Barnett stated in an interview that Pratchett was more invested in how the intellectual property would be treated than money). During negotiations, he offered to design the game before signing a deal. He did so, and Pratchett agreed. Gregg stated that the design showed respect for &quot;Discworld&quot;, and that was what persuaded Pratchett. This took roughly six months, and Pratchett was impressed with a demonstration of Rincewind using a broom to get the Luggage off the top of a wardrobe. Perfect 10 Productions developed an engine, which was developed in a separate location to &quot;keep the code clean&quot;. The dialogue was refined by Pratchett. The character design was based on Barnett giving his interpretation of characters to a character designer who had worked for Disney. He stated that they &quot;went a bit slapstick on it&quot;. The backdrops were painted manually and digitised.

Pratchett originally wanted the game to be based on &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and for the team to work in succession through the series, but Barnett believed that would be detrimental, and thought that it was difficult to make a game based on just one book (he also said in an interview that he was more interested in the Discworld itself than any particular book, and that this was so the story would not be restricted to a narrative thereof). He explained that they wanted to license all of &quot;Discworld&quot;. An original story was made, taking elements from various &quot;Discworld&quot; books, particularly &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;. Barnett stated that the team had &quot;effectively written a complete film script for the game&quot;. The game introduced a new character: a practising psychiatrist (known as the psychatrickerist). Pratchett initially objected to this, but later added his input, and the character became a retro-phrenologist. Barnett stated that he wanted to create &quot;Discworld&quot; as a flagship game for CD-based systems, and thought the &quot;Discworld&quot; licence was &quot;100% suited&quot;.

Barnett stated that he wanted to improve the British comedy by hiring voice actors with &quot;British talent&quot;. John Cleese was his first choice for Rincewind, but he rejected the offer saying that he did not do games. Pratchett wanted Nicholas Lyndhurst for Rincewind because he was physically based on his &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; character. Eric Idle was cast as Rincewind, who was tweaked to make him more like Idle from &quot;Monty Python&quot;. Other voice actors include Tony Robinson, Kate Robbins (who voiced every female character), Rob Brydon, and Jon Pertwee. Barnett wanted Christopher Lee as Death, but was unable to afford him. Brydon had already been recorded when he offered to voice Death. Barnett initially believed that Rowan Atkinson &quot;would make a great Death&quot;. According to Barnett, they were all &quot;friendly, professional, and funny&quot;, and Idle was recorded during day-long sessions in Los Angeles.

The concept art and background layouts were produced by Nick Martinelli, who, according to Barnett, was &quot;an excellent art director from the animation industry&quot;. These were illustrated and coloured by a professional team. Barnett stated that he was &quot;intimately involved&quot; with the graphics in the concept stages and initial production, but later stepped back.

The game was originally due to be published by Sierra On-line. Their engine was obtained and worked on, but due to costs for another project, they cancelled all external development. An advert in &quot;Computer Trade Weekly&quot; attracted interest from companies such as Electronic Arts and Psygnosis. The latter approached Perfect 10 Productions and would not leave until a deal was signed. Psygnosis had offered Pratchett &quot;a big cheque&quot;, which he refused. &quot;Discworld&quot;″s engine was rewritten from scratch afterwards.

The game was officially announced by September 1993 and slated for a Christmas release the following year. It was released in 1995 for the PC, PlayStation, and Macintosh. The Saturn version was released in Europe on 15 August 1996, and in Japan on 13 December 1996.

The game was released on both floppy disk and CD-ROM, with the CD version featuring a fully voiced cast of characters. For the Japanese PlayStation and Saturn releases, all voice acting was redone by Japanese comedian Junji Takada, a major selling point for the game in Japan. A port had been under way for the Philips CD-i in 1996, and had entered its final stages of development, but was never released. A 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was announced to be in development and slated to be published by Psygnosis during E3 1995, however this port was never released for unknown reasons. In an April 2020 online interview, former Perfect 10 Productions/Teeny Weeny Games member David Swan stated that Atari Corporation approached the company in regards to a potential conversion of &quot;Discworld&quot; for the Atari Jaguar CD, however no actual development started on the port beyond discussion phase due to market issues and low install base of the platform. A Sega CD release was also advertised but never published for unknown reasons as well.

== Reception ==
&quot;Discworld&quot; was a &quot;massive hit&quot; in Europe and the United Kingdom, according to director Gregg Barnett. However, the game was less successful in the United States. It received generally positive reviews. The humour and graphics in particular were widely praised, but some thought that the difficulty was too harsh. It tied for third place in &quot;Computer Game Review&quot;″s 1995 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award category. The editors noted its &quot;good voice work&quot; and &quot;very nice animation&quot;, and praised its humour. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked Discworld 78th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot; In 1998, Saturn Power listed the game 91st in its Top 100 Sega Saturn Games.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the voice-acting of Eric Idle, but criticised the PlayStation version, saying that it was difficult to navigate without the PlayStation Mouse and that the text was too small. In their review of the PlayStation version, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; similarly commented that the PlayStation mouse is required for full enjoyment, but highly praised the voice acting, humour, and graphics. Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot;, in contrast to &quot;EW&quot; and &quot;EGM&quot;, said the standard joypad &quot;works just as well&quot; as the PlayStation Mouse. He praised the humorous graphics, extensive voice acting, and script which &quot;will leave your sides aching from laughter&quot;, but found the gameplay too simplistic and lacking in challenge. He recommended it for players who were open to less serious gaming. IGN called &quot;Discworld&quot; challenging and long, but criticised the long loading times. The reviewer of described the game as &quot;very beautiful&quot; and said that the PlayStation version has more colours than the PC version, but disliked the difficulty and the size of the save game files.

&quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; cited overlong dialogues, poor graphics, and &quot;largely non-existent&quot; animation, but complimented the variety of locations to visit and their mediaeval backdrops, and described the dialogue as &quot;jokey&quot; and &quot;sarcastic&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Japanese namesake agreed with this assessment of &quot;British&quot; humour by describing it as ironic and amusing. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; reviewers believed the Saturn version had lost some authenticity, and thought that the gags were not funny, but complimented the storyline.

Reviewing the PC version, Coming Soon Magazine&#x27;s reviewer believed that the graphics are colourful and liked the humour, but criticised the way the dialogue was handled. David Tanguay of Adventure Classic Gaming described &quot;Discworld&quot; as &quot;one of the funniest adventure games ever made&quot;, but recommended that players use a walkthrough. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Charles Ardai praised the humour and believed the writing was true to Pratchett. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s reviewer praised the speech, believing it greatly improved the humour, and also complimented the difficulty, saying the game cannot be completed within days. His criticisms included the overuse of dialogue in the first act, saying most of it is irrelevant to the story, and also thought the control system &quot;falters in certain areas&quot;. He stated that &quot;Discworld&quot; is &quot;a worthy contender&quot; to &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; and challenged the hold LucasArts had on the point-and-click genre. The graphics and animation were criticised as &quot;merely average&quot; by Christopher Lindquist of &quot;PC Games&quot;, although he claimed that fans of Pratchett &quot;won&#x27;t mind&quot; the game and described it as &quot;A smart, funny--and long--gaming tribute&quot; to the series. The Macintosh version was described by &quot;Génération 4&quot; as &quot;the gag of the year!&quot;; the reviewer liked the humour and decoration, but criticised it for only being compatible with Motorola 68000-based systems. Adventure Gamers praised the voice acting, graphics, humour and story, calling it &quot;a wonderful game&quot;, but noted that &quot;it stops short of being a classic simply due to its sheer difficulty and the unwieldy nature&quot;. Adventure Gamers also called the music &quot;serviceable at best, and fairly forgettable&quot;. In 2009 Eurogamer&#x27;s Will Porter reviewed the game retrospectively, praising the game&#x27;s cartoonish graphics and voice-acting, but criticising its puzzles and noting that &quot;Discworld commits every point-and-click crime you&#x27;d care to mention&quot; (such as &quot;obtuse puzzles&quot;). The game was reviewed in 1995 in &quot;Dragon&quot; by David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook in the final &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Cook praised the &quot;exceptional&quot; animation and art, as well as the &quot;faithful&quot; conversion of Pratchett&#x27;s work to a video game, but criticised the testing and quality control as &quot;crappy&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; recommended the game for fans of Douglas Adams or Monty Python.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Darren Franich in 2010 called the game an &quot;underrated point-and-click gem&quot;, saying that it was one of the games he wanted on the PlayStation Network. In 2013, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; cited &quot;Discworld&quot; as an example demonstrating that British developers produced a disproportionately large number of overly hard video games.

<doc id="690100" wikidata="Q843886" url="?curid=690100" title="Prefectures of the Central African Republic">
<text>Since 10 December 2020, The Central African Republic is administratively divided into 20 prefectures (, Sango: &quot;kodoro kômanda-kôta&quot;) and the capital city of Bangui, which is an autonomous commune (, Sango: &quot;kôta-gbata&quot;).

Each prefecture is governed by a local assembly called General Council (&quot;Conseil Général&quot;), presided by a Prefect (&quot;Préfet&quot;). The prefectures are further subdivided into 80 sub-prefectures.

Prefectures are all named after major rivers passing through their areas:

* Ubangi, Nana, Mambéré, Kadeï, Lobaye, M&#x27;Poko, Ombella, Sangha, Kémo, Ouaka, Kotto, and Mbomou all flow into the Congo River.
* Pendé, Ouham, Gribingui, Bamingui, Bangoran, and Vakaga all flow into the Chari River, and then into Lake Chad.

(&quot;Basse&quot; (&quot;Lower&quot;) means downstream, and &quot;Haut&quot; or &quot;Haute&quot; (&quot;Upper&quot;) means upstream.)

<doc id="690101" wikidata="Q275737" url="?curid=690101" title="Annona">
<text>Annona or Anona (from Taíno &quot;annon&quot;) is a genus of flowering plants in the pawpaw/sugar apple family, Annonaceae. It is the second largest genus in the family after &quot;Guatteria&quot;, containing approximately 166 species of mostly Neotropical and Afrotropical trees and shrubs.

The generic name derives from &quot;anón&quot;, a Hispaniolan Taíno word for the fruit. Paleoethnobotanical studies have dated &quot;Annona&quot; exploitation and cultivation in the Yautepec River region of Medicoto to approximately 1000 BC. Plants of the genus have several common names, including sugar-apple, soursop, anona, chrimoya and guanabana.

Currently, seven &quot;Annona&quot; species (A. cherimola,
A. muricata, A. squamosa, A. reticulata, A. senegalensis, A. scleroderma, A. purpurea) and one hybrid (the atemoya) are cultivated for domestic or commercial use, mostly for the edible and nutritious fruits; several others such as A. crassiflora and A. salzmannii also produce edible fruits. Many of the species are used in traditional medicines for the treatment of a variety of diseases, though their efficacy has yet to be validated scientifically. Several annonaceous species have been found to contain acetogenins, a class of natural compounds with a wide variety of biological activities. The first complete genome for a species in this genus (&quot;Annona muricata&quot;) was published in 2021. The earliest fossils have been found in the Lance Formation dating to the Late Cretaceous.

==Description==
&quot;Annona&quot; species are taprooted, evergreen or semideciduous, tropical trees or shrubs. The plants typically grow in areas where air temperature does not drop below , especially Cuba, Jamaica, Central America, India the Philippines and Calabria (southern Italy). However, they have also been known to grow in certain parts of the Andes mountains in South America and in Florida.

The woody trunks have thin bark that has broad and shallow depressions or fissures which join together and are scaly, giving rise to slender, stiff, cylindrical, and tapering shoots with raised pores and naked buds. Leaf blades can be leathery or thin and rather soft or pliable, bald or hairy.

The flowering stalks rise from axils, or occasionally from axillary buds on main stems or older stems, or as solitary flowers or small bundles of flowers. Usually, the three or four deciduous sepals are smaller than the outer petals that do not overlap while in bud. Six to eight fleshy petals are arranged in two whorls—the petals of the outer whorl are larger and do not overlap; inner petals are ascending and distinctively smaller, and nectar glands are darker pigmented. The numerous stamens are ball-shaped, club-shaped, or curved and hooded or pointed beyond anther sac. Numerous pistils, attached directly to the base, are partially united to various degrees with a distinct stigma, with one or two ovules per pistil; the style and stigma are club-shaped or narrowly conic.

One fleshy, ovate to spherical fruit is produced per flower. Each fruit consists of many individual small fruits or syncarps, with one syncarp and seed per pistil. Seeds are bean-like with tough coats; the seed kernels are toxic.

Pollination occurs via Dynastid scarab beetles, which appear to be basic generalists within the genus &quot;Annona&quot;. Those species of &quot;Annona&quot; which are more morphologically derived, as well as all &quot;Rollinia&quot; spp., possess reduced floral chambers and attract small beetles such as Nitidulidae or Staphylinidae.

==Toxicology==

The compound annonacin and dozens of other acetogenins contained in the seeds and fruit of some members of Annonaceae such as &quot;Annona muricata&quot; (soursop) are neurotoxins and seem to be the cause of a Parkinson-like neurodegenerative disease. The only group of people known to be affected by this disease live on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe and the problem presumably occurs with the consumption of plants containing annonacin. The disorder is a so-called tauopathy associated with a pathologic accumulation of tau protein in the brain. Experimental results published in 2007 demonstrated for the first time that the plant neurotoxin annonacin is responsible for this accumulation.

<text>Chyna (born Joan Marie Laurer; December 27, 1969 – April 17, 2016) was an American professional wrestler, fitness model, bodybuilder, actress, adult actress and television personality.

Chyna first rose to prominence in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 1997, where she was billed as &quot;The Ninth Wonder of the World&quot; (André the Giant was already billed as the eighth). A founding member of the stable D-Generation X as the promotion&#x27;s first female enforcer, she held the WWF Intercontinental Championship (the only female performer they wrote to do so) twice and the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship once. She was also the first woman to participate in the Royal Rumble match and King of the Ring tournament, in addition to becoming number one contender to the WWF Championship. She is considered one of the biggest stars of the Attitude Era. With singles victories over several prominent male wrestlers – including multiple-time world champions Triple H, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho and Jeff Jarrett – she left what WWE called &quot;a lasting legacy as the most dominant female competitor of all time&quot;. After leaving the WWF in 2001, she wrestled sporadically, with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in 2002 and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in 2011. The latter was her final appearance in the ring.

Outside of wrestling, Chyna appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine twice, plus numerous television shows and films. She was considered a sex symbol. In 2005, she was a cast member on VH1&#x27;s &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;, which led to several other celebrity reality appearances on the network, including &quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot; in 2008. Chyna was also known for her tumultuous relationship with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman, with whom she made a sex tape released commercially in 2004 as , which won a 2006 AVN Award for Best-Selling Title. She starred in a further five pornographic titles, including AVN&#x27;s 2012 Best Celebrity Sex Tape, &quot;Backdoor to Chyna&quot;.

In 2019, Chyna was posthumously entered into the WWE Hall of Fame as a member of D-Generation X, making her the first woman to be inducted as a part of a group or team.

== Early life ==
Joan Marie Laurer was born in Rochester, New York, on December 27, 1969. Her parents divorced when she was around four years old. She had three stepfathers and one stepmother. She said her first stepfather threatened suicide at one point, while her biological father had a problem with alcoholism and once accidentally stabbed her mother in the thigh with a butcher knife. From 1973 to 1983, she, her siblings and her mother moved several times.

As a child, Laurer learned to play violin and cello. She later said that in seventh grade she was sexually kissed by a much older teacher who worked at her school. At 13, while attending Penfield High School, she began purging after she ate. She left home at 16 when her mother tried to force her into a drug rehabilitation facility and lived with her biological father. That year, she began working out, and because her abdominal muscles were so strong, she did not feel any pain when she developed an ovarian tumor. She finished her last year of high school in Spain.

Laurer attended the University of Tampa, graduating in 1992 with a major in Spanish literature. She studied French and German there (she could converse in either language) and said that during this time she was raped by two men after getting drunk at a party. She was a member of the ROTC. She originally wanted to use her knowledge of foreign languages to work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Drug Enforcement Administration. She subsequently joined the Peace Corps and was assigned to Guatemala.

After returning from abroad, she held several jobs: a cocktail waitress in a strip club, singer in a band, and a 900-number chat line worker. In her mid-to-late 20s, while living in the Florida Keys, she took a six-week class to train as a flight attendant. On the way to her first flight, she was in a car crash and spent four days in the hospital. When she recovered, her sister Kathy helped her get a job selling pagers; they both also worked as belly dancers.

After college, Laurer began to regularly enter fitness competitions. In 1996, she competed in the New York City regional level of the Fitness America competition. Because of her large size compared to the other women, she usually finished in last place.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1995–1997) ===
Laurer trained at Wladek &quot;Killer&quot; Kowalski&#x27;s professional wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts. Her first match was in 1995 against a male wrestler dressed as a woman. While attending the school, she also worked for various independent promotions as Joanie Lee. Some of her earliest matches were set up by The Fabulous Moolah.

Laurer met World Wrestling Federation (WWF) performers Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque (then known as Hunter Hearst Helmsley) and Shawn Michaels after a professional wrestling show in 1996. After watching tapes of her matches, they decided to bring her into the WWF as a bodyguard. Vince McMahon, owner of the WWF, initially did not want her to join the company because he did not believe the audience would find a woman beating up men believable. While waiting for the WWF&#x27;s decision, Laurer was approached by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), who wanted her to be the sole female member of the New World Order. She initially accepted the offer, but later turned it down when Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon&#x27;s son, informed her that she was about to be hired by the WWF. However, Kowalski said that he got Laurer hired by the WWF after introducing her to Shane McMahon and telling him of WCW&#x27;s interest in her.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1997–2001) ===

==== D-Generation X (1997–1999) ====
Laurer made her WWF debut on February 16, 1997, at In Your House 13: Final Four; her character emerged as a plant from a ringside seat, choking Marlena while Goldust was in the ring with Triple H. The next night, she appeared on Raw and bearhugged Marlena. Her original role in the promotion was as the laconic enforcer/bodyguard for D-Generation X, which was founded by Shawn Michaels and Triple H. She often helped them (then, a rising villain) cheat to win by physically interfering in matches by executing her trademark low blow to the groin. She was later given the ring name &quot;Chyna&quot;, an intentionally ironic moniker; fine china is delicate and fragile, a sharp contrast to her character. Offstage, however, the male wrestlers were hesitant at first to let a woman be seen overpowering them.

During her time in D-Generation X, she was put in a romantic storyline with Mark Henry, member of the rival stable Nation of Domination. It started in August 1998 after The Rock ordered Henry to kiss Chyna to humiliate her, during which she fought back. Henry would chase her romantically, eventually threatening her with a storyline sexual harassment demand over one of her beatdowns if she didn&#x27;t go to a date with him. Chyna accepted and eventually reconciled with him, becoming his on-screen girlfriend and ally. However, in January 1999, she revealed it was all a ruse to humiliate Henry.

A week after her storyline with Henry, Chyna was the 30th entrant in the Royal Rumble, becoming the first woman ever to enter the eponymous match. In the match she eliminated Mark Henry before being eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. One day later, she turned heel by betraying Triple H and aligning herself with his enemies Vince McMahon and Kane. She teamed with Kane at the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre pay-per-view against former allies X-Pac and Triple H. At WrestleMania XV, she turned on Kane in his match by attacking him with a chair, appearing to rejoin DX. Chyna and Triple H, however, turned against DX later that evening when they helped Shane McMahon defeat DX member X-Pac. The duo became part of The Corporation and later Shane McMahon&#x27;s Corporate Ministry. Following the dissolution of the Corporate Ministry, the villainous Chyna remained at Triple H&#x27;s side. They split up later that year.

==== Intercontinental Champion (1999–2000) ====
In June 1999, Chyna became the first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring tournament. She was also the first woman to be the number one contender for the WWF Championship, but lost the spot to Mankind before SummerSlam in August. Later that year, she became a fan favorite again during her long feud with Jeff Jarrett. She challenged the British Bulldog to a match on the October 4, 1999, Raw, and defeated him. At Unforgiven, she had a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jarrett, which she lost. She defeated Jarrett for the title at No Mercy in his last WWF match, a Good Housekeeping match on October 17, in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship. She also gained the services of his valet, Miss Kitty. Laurer said that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon to lose the title cleanly to a woman. His contract had expired on October 16, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view. If he had not appeared, the WWF would have been criticized for false advertising, and the title&#x27;s lineage would have been broken.

Chyna then feuded with Chris Jericho over the belt, defeating him at Survivor Series, but losing the title to him at Armageddon. They faced off again in a match on the edition of December 28 of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which ended controversially with both wrestlers pinning each other. As a result, then &quot;head of authority&quot; Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley declared them co-champions. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho and Chyna defended the title against Hardcore Holly in a Triple Threat match to determine the Intercontinental Champion, which Jericho won. Chyna&#x27;s &quot;co-champions&quot; reign is no longer recognized by WWE and is now considered a continuation of Jericho&#x27;s second Intercontinental reign. Afterwards, Chyna briefly teamed with Jericho.

==== Storyline with Eddie Guerrero and Women&#x27;s Champion (2000–2001) ====

Not long after losing the Intercontinental title, Chyna became the onscreen girlfriend of Eddie Guerrero. Originally villains, they became fan favorites during the summer of 2000, with Guerrero dubbing her his &quot;Mamacita&quot;. They faced Val Venis and then-rookie Trish Stratus in an intergender tag team match at SummerSlam with the Intercontinental Championship on the line. Chyna won the match, but lost the belt two weeks later to Guerrero in a Triple Threat match with Kurt Angle. They officially split in November 2000 after Chyna, in storyline, found Eddie cavorting in the shower with two other women.

At the same time, Chyna posed nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s November 2000 issue. It was also worked into a WWF storyline (based, in part, on a real-life legal feud between the WWF and the socially conservative Parents Television Council), in which it drew the ire of the Right to Censor (a group of morally conservative wrestlers). Shortly after, Chyna began a feud with Ivory, a member of the Right to Censor, over the Women&#x27;s Championship. It culminated in a storyline at the Royal Rumble where Chyna appeared to reinjure her neck while performing a handspring back elbow. To convince the audience she was injured, color commentator Jerry Lawler left the commentators&#x27; booth and entered the ring to check on her condition, something he had not done since the in-ring accident that killed Owen Hart in 1999. When she returned from the &quot;injury&quot;, she won the Women&#x27;s Championship from Ivory at WrestleMania X-Seven in a squash match. She also defended her title against Lita at Judgment Day in 2001. She soon vacated the title, however, as it was her final WWF match.

She left the WWF on November 30, 2001, several months after she had been taken off of television. Various accounts of her departure have circulated over the years. Behind the scenes, her former real-life boyfriend Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque began a relationship with Stephanie McMahon; Chyna said the pair began seeing each other before she and Levesque had broken up. In a 2002 interview with &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, Chyna indicated that the breakup with Levesque had nothing to do with her leaving WWF, stating she left to pursue an acting career. At the time of Chyna&#x27;s departure from WWF Jim Ross, then Executive Vice President of Talent Relations, reported it was &quot;mutually agreed&quot; to let her WWF contract expire in order for her to explore other career options. In a 2015 interview with Vince Russo, Chyna said after a meeting with Vince McMahon about the Stephanie McMahon situation, she was sent home and later received a fax telling her that she was not needed anymore. After Chyna&#x27;s death, Chyna&#x27;s sister Kathy reported the wrestler was offered a new WWF contract in 2001 with a minimum salary of $400,000 per year and the potential for substantially higher income via merchandising and pay-per-view appearances, but she refused to sign a contract for less than a base salary of $1 million per year. Ross later confirmed this account, characterizing the demand for $1 million per year as &quot;outrageous&quot; and unrealistic, leaving WWF officials reluctant to negotiate with her despite her fan popularity.

=== Japan (2002) ===
After the end of her WWF career in 2001, Chyna made her way to Japan in 2002 where she had a relatively brief but productive stint with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Her first appearance was at the New Japan Thirtieth Anniversary Show, refereeing a bout between the Steiner Brothers and Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kensuke Sasaki. On August 8, 2002, Chyna defeated woman boxer Chika Nakamura for Universal Fighting Arts Organization, beating Nakamura in the first round by TKO. In September and October 2002, she wrestled several matches for the promotion. After losing to Masahiro Chono on October 14, 2002, Laurer performed her final match on October 26, teaming with a fake Great Muta played by Troy Enders in a loss to Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kenzo Suzuki. Despite working with the biggest names like Masahiro Chono and Hiroshi Tanahashi, Chyna could not break out as a relevant player for NJPW.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2011) ===
During the May 3, 2011, tapings of the edition of May 12 of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Chyna made her Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) debut, introduced by the returning Spike TV network consultant Mick Foley. He introduced her as Kurt Angle&#x27;s business associate (she had been previously referred to as his &quot;Mistress&quot;) and tag team partner at Sacrifice, where they would face Jeff Jarrett and Karen Jarrett. During the taping she also took part in a battle royal, where she eliminated Jeff. At Sacrifice on May 15, Chyna submitted Karen for the win in the mixed tag team match. She left TNA shortly after, making Sacrifice 2011 her final wrestling match.

== Other media ==

=== &quot;Playboy&quot; ===

Laurer modeled nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; in the November 2000 issue. In 2002, following her departure from the WWF, she appeared in a second nude pictorial. She also filmed a &quot;Playboy&quot; adult documentary, &quot;Joanie Laurer Nude: Wrestling Superstar to Warrior Princess&quot;, which followed her on the set.

=== Literature ===
In 2001, Laurer released her autobiography, &quot;If They Only Knew&quot;. It spent time on &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ bestseller list.

=== Television and film ===
Laurer appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in 2000, where she claimed she &quot;made [an ass] out of [her]self.&quot; She also appeared in three epidsodes of &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; as Janice, a police officer who briefly dated Harry Solomon, and in several commercials for Stacker. She was a presenter at the MTV Video Music Awards.

In 2001, she was a guest on a special celebrity edition of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. She lost in the final round of the competition to Coolio. She provided her voice for stop-motion animation renditions of herself in Celebrity Deathmatch and Gary &amp; Mike. The next year, she was reportedly considered for a part in &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, but lost the role to Kristanna Loken. She hosted &quot;Robot Wars: Grand Champions&quot; in 2002, and appeared on the celebrity game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in 2003.

Laurer appeared as Lulu in Sevendust&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Enemy&quot; in 2003.

In early 2005, she debuted on &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; with housemates Da Brat, Jane Wiedlin, Adrianne Curry, Christopher Knight, Marcus Schenkenberg and Verne Troyer. On the show, she drank heavily, appeared nude, and got into an argument with her ex, Sean Waltman. She remained friends with Adrianne Curry after the show and made a brief cameo on her reality show &quot;My Fair Brady&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot;, which began airing on VH1 in January 2007. Filming took place in April 2006 in Las Vegas. She was eliminated from the show in the seventh episode.

Also in 2006, Laurer appeared in &quot;Just Another Romantic Wrestling Comedy&quot; and &quot;Illegal Aliens&quot;, the latter of which was the last movie featuring Anna Nicole Smith. On &quot;Cristina&#x27;s Court&quot;, a syndicated court-themed reality show, Laurer appeared in an episode originally airing July 14, 2007, in a civil dispute against a breeder of teacup chihuahuas. Judge Perez ruled in her favor and awarded her $4,000.

=== Adult films ===
Laurer made her adult film debut with the 2004 video &quot;1 Night in China&quot;. Laurer and Sean Waltman approached Red Light District Video to distribute the homemade video, which was released in 2004. Laurer appeared in her second adult video, &quot;Another Night in China&quot; in 2009. In 2011, she starred in her first professional pornographic film for Vivid Video, &quot;Backdoor to Chyna&quot;. She also starred for Vivid as She-Hulk in their parody of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, released in May 2012. A spinoff feature centered on the She-Hulk character, &quot;She-Hulk XXX,&quot; was released to video in April 2013.

In one of her final YouTube videos before her death, she said that she&#x27;d had no ambitions to go into porn, but was &quot;making lemonade out of lemons&quot; after the video of her and X-Pac was released &quot;without her permission&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Laurer&#x27;s breast implants were custom-made for her after her first implants were ruptured during a wrestling match. She had also complained to her plastic surgeon that their largest implants did not suit her frame as she desired. The custom implants became the model for the Chyna 2000s, now marketed to large-framed women and female bodybuilders. Laurer said she paid $6,000 for them.
From 1996 until 2000, Laurer dated fellow wrestler Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque. They initially hid their relationship from their co-workers because she felt people might think she &quot;[slept] her way to the top&quot;. They also lived together for some time. There is some debate as to whether Levesque started his relationship with Stephanie McMahon while still with Laurer. However, after Laurer&#x27;s death, her sister Kathy Hamilton told Bleacher Report that while Levesque &quot;was very good to Joanie&quot;, the couple disagreed about future family plans (Levesque wanted children and Laurer did not), and that Laurer&#x27;s addictions and mental health problems also contributed to their breakup.

Beginning in 2003, Laurer had a tumultuous relationship with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman. They were engaged for a period in 2003, then broke up, then became engaged again, a pattern that continued for the next two years. In 2004, they released a sex tape which was filmed in 2003. Eager for a repeat success, the company that released Paris Hilton&#x27;s celebrity sex tape obtained the footage, edited it, and released it under the name &quot;1 Night in China&quot;. It sold over 100,000 copies, with Laurer and Waltman earning a share of the profits. Laurer, however, maintained that she did not earn any money from the release. In January 2005, she was arrested for domestic assault after allegedly beating Waltman in front of his children.
On February 8, 2007, a visibly upset Laurer appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; to speak about her friend Anna Nicole Smith, who had died earlier that day. Laurer said that she &quot;knew it was coming&quot; because of how the media ridiculed Smith, and she drew parallels between the plight of Smith and herself. However, the wife of the CEO of Trim Spa, Monique Goen, stated that Smith did not consider Laurer a friend.

After leaving the WWF, Laurer was unable to use the name &quot;Chyna&quot; because of its trademark. She began using the name &quot;Chyna Doll&quot; for public appearances. In November 2007, she legally changed her name to Chyna.

She also had problems with substance abuse. She said that her &quot;life was spinning out of control&quot; around the time she made the sex tape. In January 2005, Waltman said that she was battling drug and alcohol addiction, as well as mental illness. Days after the domestic dispute between Waltman and Laurer, it was reported in the &quot;New York Post&quot; that she had removed her clothes and jumped into a fish tank in a New York nightclub. That month, she made another appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, where she was described as &quot;slurring her words, contradicting herself and launching into random tangents that were impossible to follow.&quot; On the program, she said she did not want to do drugs anymore, but said that if a line of cocaine was in front of her, she would do it. After her appearance, she entered a facility specializing in depression recovery, and decided to stop drinking. In early 2008, she appeared on the VH1 reality TV show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, but said on the show that she did not consider herself an addict. On December 27, 2008, she was rushed to the hospital after her birthday party, where she was found unconscious with cuts on her arms.

Laurer had a strained relationship with her family. She last saw her mother at the age of 16, and she said that her father was never able to get over her decision not to pursue a career in law enforcement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. She also alleged that her father took out several student loans in her name without her knowledge, leaving her with $40,000 in debt. On an episode of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot; in 2008, Laurer said she had a bad relationship with all of her family members, including her siblings. In September 2010, Laurer was hospitalized after overdosing on sleeping medication. Laurer later re-established a good relationship with her mother; her father died on May 15, 2014.

From early 2012 until mid-2015, Laurer taught English in Japan. She converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints while there.

== Death ==
On April 20, 2016, Laurer was found dead at her home in Redondo Beach, California at the age of 46. Her manager Anthony Anzaldo was concerned when she did not post updates or content to her usual social media outlets for several days, and subsequently found her body in her apartment. Initial police reports stated that she appeared to have died of either an accidental drug overdose or of natural causes. Anzaldo suggested that any overdose was accidental, saying that she was prescribed drugs, but tended to use them improperly.

Her brain was donated to science to study the effects of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, the brain had naturally decomposed to a point where it could not be definitively determined whether Laurer had CTE. A memorial service was held in Los Angeles on June 22, 2016. Among the attendees were wrestlers Melina Perez, Rob Van Dam, Sean Waltman and Johnny Mantell; actors C. Thomas Howell and Barry Williams; Dennis Hof, owner of the Bunny Ranch; and singers Coolio and Baby Bash, who also performed during the memorial. Chyna was cremated and her ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

A report of her autopsy was released in December 2016 which determined that she died on April 17 of an overdose of alcohol, combined with the anxiety drugs diazepam and nordazepam, painkillers oxycodone and oxymorphone, and sleeping aid temazepam.

== Legacy ==
Numerous commentators have credited Chyna as being influential to women&#x27;s wrestling and one of the biggest stars of WWF&#x27;s Attitude Era. Commentator and former WWE official Jim Ross called her, &quot;the distinctive athlete [who] was to WWE what Ronda Rousey has been to UFC&quot;, while E! News said that she accomplished more in her near-decade career than any other woman. Others praised her as a feminist icon who defied gender norms; Dawn Heinecken, a professor of women&#x27;s and gender studies at the University of Louisville, wrote in 2004 that &quot;She was demonized as a feminist who challenged male dominance ... Her latest, and most popular incarnation was that of a sex symbol&quot;. She was the first woman to compete in the Royal Rumble match and is the only woman to have held the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Luke Winkie of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed her as the 79th greatest wrestler of all time, while WWE named her the fourth greatest &quot;Female Superstar in Modern WWE History&quot; in 2021. Beth Phoenix credits her with &quot;breaking down doors&quot; in the industry, and Kimber Lee credits Chyna as her motivation for entering wrestling. In 2017, WWE Hall of Famer Tammy Sytch said Chyna should be inducted into the Hall of Fame, stating: &quot;I believe she really opened up the doors for women&#x27;s wrestling; not for Divas, but for the women&#x27;s wrestling industry. She was wrestling men and it was believable because she was such a big personality, such a huge human being, and she should be rewarded for what she did.&quot;
The day following her death, a post on WWE.com expressed sadness about it and featured a video of her winning the Women&#x27;s Championship. After years without acknowledging Laurer, WWE played a posthumous tribute video on the April 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. A short memorial article was also published on Howard Stern&#x27;s official website, lamenting her death and describing her as &quot;fan favorite [with a] great sense of humor about herself.&quot;

Columnist Mike Mooneyham of &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; stated after Chyna&#x27;s death that it was &quot;an oft-asked question&quot; as to when she would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Jim Ross said that Chyna had an &quot;overwhelming desire&quot; to be inducted during her lifetime. On February 9, 2015, during a WWE Network podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Paul Levesque mentioned that Chyna deserved to be in the Hall of Fame but that her career in pornography prohibited it. In interviews shortly after her death, Levesque said that she &quot;definitely warranted&quot; a place in the Hall of Fame and Stephanie McMahon said she was sure Chyna would be inducted but did not know what year it would happen.

Chyna was announced as an inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2019 on February 18, 2019, as part of D-Generation X. Levesque spoke to ESPN of the &quot;complexities&quot; he mentioned on the 2015 Austin podcast, but after describing her in-ring accomplishments he said she &quot;100 percent deserves&quot; the honor. Although she was being inducted as part of a group, Levesque said that she deserved to be inducted a second time as well for her individual career. Shawn Michaels also endorsed the idea of her being inducted a second time, stating: &quot;Of all the people in this group, and D-Generation X as a whole is deserving, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anybody that would argue that [Chyna] is not the most deserving of [an induction].&quot;

=== Posthumous documentary ===
On April 20, 2017, a trailer was released for &quot;Wrestling with Chyna&quot;, a special documentary featuring Chyna&#x27;s life from almost her very beginning, to after she left the wrestling business, to her last days of life. On June 16, 2021, Vice TV aired the documentary with exclusive interviews from friends and family members and her manager Anthony Anzaldo.

<text>The Hunted is a 2003 American action thriller film directed by William Friedkin. It stars Tommy Lee Jones as a retired civilian contractor and SOF Trainer, who is tasked with tracking down a former student of his played by Benicio del Toro who has gone rogue; Connie Nielsen also stars.

The film was released on March 14, 2003. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $46 million against its $55 million budget.

==Plot==

The movie begins with Aaron Hallam, a SOF operator, fighting as part of a unit in the war in Kosovo. Infiltrating a mosque, he successfully assassinates a genocidal Serbian military leader. Hallam is awarded the Silver Star for this act, but is left traumatized by the atrocities he witnessed.

In Silver Falls State Park, Oregon, Hallam encounters two apparent deer hunters with expensive high-powered sniper rifles. He accuses them of not being genuine hunters due to their usage of guns and scopes. The two men pursue him, but are no match for his tactics/traps and are brutally murdered.

Meanwhile, L.T. Bonham, a former civilian survival and combat instructor for spec ops soldiers, lives in a secluded cabin deep in British Columbia. He finds a white wolf caught in a snare, frees it, treats its injury, then tracks down in a bar the man who set the snare, knocks him out, then warns his buddies not to use them again.

Sometime later, Bonham is approached by the FBI, who asks him to help apprehend the perpetrator of the killings. Bonham agrees and joins the FBI task force led by Abby Durrell. Arriving at the crime scene, he proves that one man with a knife was responsible for the hunters’s deaths, not several men with hatchets as previously believed by the agents. Bonham convinces Abby to let him track the killer on his own, but she insists that he take an FBI radio.

Bonham discovers Hallam&#x27;s personal effects in a small cave just before the assassin appears, and recognizes him as one of his students. Hallam asks Bonham why he never answered the letters he sent, but Bonham demands to know why Hallam killed those hunters. His protege explains that he believes the men were “sweepers” sent by the government to eliminate him. Bonham fails to talk Hallam into surrendering, and the two of them come to blows before Hallam is tranquilized and taken into custody by the FBI, who tracked his teacher’s radio.

During his interrogation, Aaron is uncooperative, rambling about the slaughter of chickens, and how humans would feel if they were in the same position. He only wants to talk to L.T, who urges him not to discuss his covert operations. When questioned by Abby, Bonham admits that his father prevented him from joining the military after his brother was killed during the war in Vietnam to avoid losing another son. L.T followed his father’s footsteps and became a tracker before being contracted by the Armed Forces.

The FBI is then forced to hand Hallam over to three of his fellow operators led by Dale Hewitt, who arrives with a letter authorizing them to take Hallam. Hewitt tells them that Hallam lost control during a mission that came after the war in Kosovo, killing numerous innocent civilians, and that he cannot stand trial because his military assignments are classified. While being transported, Aaron, upon learning that he will be summarily executed to ensure his silence, manages to kill the operatives and escape.

Alerted to the incident, Bonham and the FBI search for Hallam. Bonham finds him at the house of his ex-girlfriend and her daughter in Portland, Oregon. The two have a tense stare-down and stand-off, but Hallam flees after Abby arrives to apprehend him. Bonham follows him out of the window, and narrowly dodges a car Aaron stole from the garage. Later, in a wooden compartment, Durell and Bonham find Hallam’s silver star and a letter accusing L.T of sending the aforementioned hunters to kill him, confirming his paranoid mental state.

Relentlessly chased by the FBI, his former instructor, and the Portland Police Bureau, Hallam flees into a sewer. There, he ambushes and kills Harry Van Zandt, Abby’s Boss, as well as her partner and friend Bobby Moret, before escaping by boarding a streetcar to blend in. The police block the bridge, and he takes a hostage at knife-point to escape from Bonham. Eventually, Aaron climbs to and then dives off the top of the bridge, fleeing upstream.

Abby, devastated and wanting revenge for her fallen colleagues, intends to deploy the full force of the FBI into the woods in search of Hallam. Bonham protests this, asserting that sending more agents after Hallam will only result in further bloodshed, and unsuccessfully argues that he is the only one who can stop the renegade soldier he trained.

Resurfacing up the river, Hallam crafts a knife out of reclaimed metal, and Bonham crafts a knife out of stone and enters the wilderness alone to search. Bonham is caught by one of Hallam&#x27;s traps and is thrown down a waterfall. He meets his student at the bottom, and they engage in hand-to-hand combat. The two sustain severe injuries, and Bonham’s knife is broken, but he gains the upper hand and fatally stabs Hallam with his own knife just as Abby and the FBI arrive.

Bonham, mostly recovered, returns to his home in British Columbia. He rereads and then burns Hallam&#x27;s aforementioned letters that expressed his concerns over the things he witnessed during his military service. Going outside to get more firewood, Bonham spots the same white wolf he saved earlier running through the snow, watches it contemplatively.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was partially filmed in and around Portland, Oregon and Silver Falls State Park. Portland scenes were filmed in Oxbow Park, the South Park Blocks, the Columbia Blvd Treatment Plant, and Tom McCall Waterfront Park. The technical adviser for the film was Tom Brown Jr., an American outdoorsman and wilderness survival expert. The story is partially inspired by a real-life incident involving Brown, who was asked to track down a former pupil and Special Forces sergeant who had evaded capture by authorities. This story is told in Tom&#x27;s book, &quot;Case Files Of The Tracker&quot;. Chapter 2 of this book, &quot;My Frankenstein,&quot; describes Brown&#x27;s tracking and fight with a former special operations veteran.

The hand-to-hand combat and knife fighting in the film featured Filipino Martial Arts. Thomas Kier and Rafael Kayanan of Sayoc Kali were brought in by Benicio del Toro. They were credited as knife fight choreographers for the film.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The box office for the film was less than its reported production budget of $55 million. &quot;The Hunted&quot; opened on March 14, 2003, at #3 in 2,516 theaters across North America and grossed $13.48 million during its opening weekend. It went on to gross $34,244,097 in North America and $11,252,437 internationally markets for a worldwide total of $45,496,534.

Buena Vista International handles the distribution in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Netherlands and parts of Latin America.

Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International handles Finnish &amp; Swedish theatrical distribution through its then distribution partner Nordisk Film.

In United Kingdom - Redbus Film Distribution handles distribution under the name Helkon SK. It was released on 6 June 2003 (despite being renamed to Redbus on 6 May 2003).

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Many reviewers noted striking similarities to &quot;First Blood&quot;, with which this film was unfavorably compared. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;Just a &quot;Rambo&quot; rehash.&quot; While there was some praise for the cinematography and the action scenes, much criticism was directed at the thin plot and characterization, and the general implausibility. Rex Reed of the &quot;New York Observer&quot; called it a &quot;Ludicrous, plotless, ho-hum tale of lurid confrontation.&quot; The UK magazine, &quot;Total Film&quot; said the film was &quot;scarcely exciting to watch.&quot;

However, the film also received praise from other high-profile critics, particularly for the fact it kept the special effects and stunts restrained. For example, Roger Ebert said, &quot;We&#x27;ve seen so many fancy high-tech computer-assisted fight scenes in recent movies that we assume the fighters can fly. They live in a world of gravity-free speed-up. Not so with Friedkin&#x27;s characters.&quot; He reviewed the film on his own site and scored it 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. &quot;Time Out London&quot; was also positive saying, &quot;Friedkin&#x27;s lean, mean thriller shows itself more interested in process than context, subtlety and character development pared away in favour of headlong momentum and crunching set pieces.&quot;

<text>Burundi is divided into eighteen provinces, each named after their respective capital with the exception of Bujumbura Rural.

== History ==
The Belgian colonial administration created provinces in Burundi on September 26, 1960, to replace chiefdoms as part of a series of administrative reforms. There were 18: Bubanza, Bukirasazi, Bururi, Cankuzo, Cibitoke, Karuzi, Kayanza, Kitega, Kirundo, Makamba, Muhinga, Muramvya, Mwaro, Mwisale, Ngozi, Ruyigi, Rutana, and Usumbura. The 1962 constitution of the Kingdom of Burundi provided for eight provinces: Bubanza, Bukirasazi, Bururi, Gitega, Muramvya, Muyinga, Ngozi, and Ruyigi.

In 2000, the province encompassing Bujumbura was separated into two provinces, Bujumbura Rural and Bujumbura Mairie. The newest province, Rumonge, was created on 26 March 2015 from portions of Bujumbura Rural and Bururi.

In July 2022, the government of Burundi announced a complete overhaul of the country&#x27;s territorial subdivisions. The proposed change would reduce the amounts of provinces from 18 to 5, and reduce the amount of communes from 119 to 42. The change were approved by both the National Assembly and the Senate and will take effect in 2025 with the new parliamentary elections.

With the new administrative division, the country is now made up of 5 provinces : Buhumuza, Bujumbura, Burunga, Butanyerera and Gitega. These provinces are furthermore subdivided into 42 communes, 451 zones and 3044 hills (or districts)

<doc id="690108" wikidata="Q4575101" url="?curid=690108" title="Bizarro (comic strip)">
<text>Bizarro is a single-panel cartoon written and drawn by American cartoonist Dan Piraro and later by cartoonist Wayne &quot;Wayno&quot; Honath. The cartoon specializes in surrealist humor and at times is slightly cryptic in its humor. The creator often includes hidden symbols in the drawing that refer to inside jokes or other elements.

== Publication history ==
Launched January 21, 1985, the panel appears daily in 350 markets throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia. Initially syndicated by Chronicle Features, it moved to the Universal Press Syndicate in 1995 and then King Features Syndicate in 2003.

On January 1, 2018, Piraro&#x27;s friend and colleague Wayne &quot;Wayno&quot; Honath took over creative duties on the daily strip, with Piraro continuing to do the Sunday strip. Honath had collaborated on writing the strip since 2009, and drew it for a few previous stretches.

==Characters and story==
&quot;Bizarro&quot; offers an eccentric, exaggerated and, as the name implies, bizarre look at everyday life. Piraro described it as &quot;about the incredibly surreal things that happen to all of us in our so-called &#x27;normal&#x27; lives.&quot; The situations are surreal, yet often plausible. Some cartoons involve celebrities, while others make reference to themselves or characters from comics or animation (such as Superman and Gumby). Comics critic Tom Heintjes described &quot;Bizarro&quot;&#x27;s themes, cryptic aspects and expansion into performance art:
:Piraro has taken his panel in directions simultaneously surreal and topical. In a comic universe where world-weary talking dogs exist alongside nihilistic housewives, Piraro gives his cartoons heft by skewering his own &quot;bêtes noires&quot;: wasteful consumerism, environmental destruction, corporate greed and sheeplike people, to name a few. (He also espouses animal rights in his work, for which the Humane Society honored him in January with its Genesis Award.) Though his humor is never didactic, Piraro&#x27;s work is remarkable in its unwillingness to pander, even when the occasional panel borders on the inscrutable. (For example, he once used the Etruscans as a punchline; if you skipped history class that day, tough.) The 54-year-old Kansas City, Missouri, native has also begun participating in the nascent vaudeville revival with his one-man &quot;Bizarro Bologna Show&quot;, an entertainment potpourri into which he incorporates puppetry, song, ventriloquism, mind reading and drawing (not to mention slides of &quot;Bizarro&quot; cartoons too blue for newspaper publication). Creatively restive, Piraro also produces fine art, some of which uses the Catholic imagery that he was exposed to at parochial school.

==Hidden symbols==

Most &quot;Bizarro&quot; cartoons since 1995 include one or more of these elements hidden somewhere in the cartoon:
* an eyeball (the Eyeball of Observation), 
* a piece of pie (the Pie of Opportunity), 
* a rabbit (the Bunny of Exuberance), 
* an alien in a spaceship (the Flying Saucer of Possibility), 
* the abbreviation &quot;K2&quot; (referring to Piraro&#x27;s children Kaitlin and Killian), 
* a crown (the Crown of Power), 
* a stick of dynamite (the Dynamite of Unintended Consequences), 
* a shoe (the Lost Loafer), 
* an arrow (The Arrow of Vulnerability), 
* a fish tail (The Fish of Humility) 
* an upside down bird (the Inverted Bird)
* Olive Oyl, or the abbreviation &quot;O2&quot; (the Mighty Oyl) (first occurrences in May 2017)
* a smoker&#x27;s pipe (the Pipe of Ambiguity), added 01/01/2021

As of 2008, Piraro indicates how many symbols are hidden in each strip with a number above his signature.

==Awards==
The strip and its creator have received several awards, including the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award (1999, 2000 and 2001). They were nominated for the NCS Reuben Award each year from 2002 to 2010, finally winning in 2010. 

In 2005, Piraro was seen in the 75th anniversary edition of &quot;Blondie&quot;.

<text>Gail Kim-Irvine (born February 20, 1977) is a Canadian-American retired professional wrestler. She is signed to TNA Wrestling, where she serves as a producer. In TNA she was the inaugural and record setting seven-time Knockouts Champion and she also was a one-time Knockouts Tag Team Champion with Madison Rayne. She is also known for her tenure in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where she won the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship in her first match.

Kim began her career wrestling on the Canadian-American independent circuit, before joining WWE in 2002. She became the first WWE Diva in history to win a championship in her debut match. After being released by WWE in 2004, Kim joined TNA in September 2005. There, she joined the tag team America&#x27;s Most Wanted as their valet. After the dissolution of the group, Kim performed as a singles wrestler, eventually becoming the inaugural TNA Knockouts Champion in October 2007. During her time in TNA, she had an acclaimed feud with Awesome Kong, which is generally considered one of the greatest women&#x27;s wrestling feuds of the 2000s.

She later left TNA in August 2008, to return to WWE three months later, where she remained until 2011. The following October she returned to TNA. In 2012, &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; named Kim the number one female wrestler in the world and in 2016 she was announced as the first female inductee into the TNA Wrestling Hall of Fame.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early Career (2000–2002)===
After obtaining her degree from Ryerson University, Kim decided to become a professional wrestler and joined Ron Hutchison&#x27;s School of Pro Wrestling in Toronto. She received supplementary training from Rob Etchevarria at the Squared Circle Pro Wrestling Gym. She debuted in December 2000, wearing a mask and wrestling as &quot;The Queen of the Cats&quot; La Felina in the Southern Ontario-based Apocalypse Wrestling Federation. She, however, was eventually unmasked by Tracy Brooks in a &quot;Mask versus Hair&quot; match. Kim worked on the Canadian independent circuit for two years, wrestling for promotions such as Border City Wrestling.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2004)===
Kim was introduced to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) employee Nora Greenwald (known on-screen as Molly Holly) by Jason Sensation in 2001; Greenwald encouraged Kim to send her videos and tapes to WWF officials. In October 2002, she was hired by the WWF, now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). She spent eight months training in their then-developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) and wrestled house shows and dark matches before being called up to their main roster. After several weeks of vignettes showcasing &quot;Matrix&quot;-like effects aired on &quot;Raw&quot;, Kim debuted on June 30 as a fan favorite, with a &quot;Matrix&quot;-inspired outfit.

Her first televised WWE match was a seven-woman battle royal on the June 30, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; with the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship, then held by an injured Jazz, on the line. Kim won the match by lastly eliminating Victoria. Kim held the title for four weeks, successfully defending it once against Molly Holly, before losing it to Holly on the July 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. The following week, Kim turned heel on Trish Stratus, which stemmed from a previous &quot;Raw&quot; episode where Stratus cost Kim and herself a tag match against Victoria and Holly; Kim subsequently formed an alliance with Holly to take on Stratus, defeating her and various partners on several occasions, until Stratus was later assisted by Lita. At WWE&#x27;s Unforgiven pay-per-view event on September 21, Stratus and Lita defeated Kim and Holly in a tag team match. The four women continued to feud until November, when Kim was sidelined with a broken right collarbone.

Kim returned to &quot;Raw&quot; in April 2004 and immediately reforged her alliance with Holly. In May 2004, Kim submitted then-Women&#x27;s Champion Victoria twice, in singles match and a six-woman tag match, earning herself a title shot at Bad Blood. However, Lita pinned Kim on the June 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and Lita and Trish Stratus were added to the championship match. At Bad Blood on June 13, she faced Lita, Stratus, and Victoria in a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship, which was won by Stratus.

Kim participated in a battle royal on October 19 at Taboo Tuesday, which was won by Stratus. Kim, however, was released by WWE on November 3, 2004, as a result of cost cutting. Kim was caught off guard by her release and was told that management wanted to take the women&#x27;s division in a new direction.

===Independent Circuit (2005)===
After her release from WWE, Kim made an appearance for Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling on January 22, 2005, in South Korea, teaming with Lollipop in a tag team match, where they defeated Malia Hosaka and Nidia. On June 26, Kim made her debut for World Series Wrestling (WSW) in Melbourne, Australia, losing to Nidia in a singles match. Two days later at another WSW event in Sydney, Kim defeated Nidia in a rematch. The following night, Kim teamed up with A.J. Styles to defeat Nidia and Christopher Daniels in a mixed tag team match.

====America&#x27;s Most Wanted (2005–2007)====
Following her release from WWE and the expiration of her 90-day no-compete clause, Kim made sporadic appearances on the independent circuit, including at Michigan&#x27;s All World Wrestling League and in Japan. She also competed in Korea and Mexico before being signed by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on September 6, 2005. She made her TNA debut on the October 8, 2005, episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, aligning herself with Jeff Jarrett and America&#x27;s Most Wanted (AMW) (Chris Harris and James Storm) and taking on the role of AMW&#x27;s and Jarrett&#x27;s manager, and regularly got physically involved in the wrestlers&#x27; matches. Kim made her in-ring debut on July 16, 2006, at TNA&#x27;s Victory Road pay-per-view in a Six Man Mixed Tag Team match with AMW against A.J. Styles, Christopher Daniels, and Sirelda.

The first encounter between the group was on February 11 at Against All Odds in a mixed tag team match, which Kim and her partner, Petey Williams, lost. On March 11 at Destination X, Storm and Jacqueline won a rematch against Kim and Williams in a Double Bullrope match. Kim went on to defeat Jacqueline in a Six Sides of Steel cage match on April 15 at Lockdown. Their feud came to an end on the May 3 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, when Kim defeated Jacqueline under street fight rules.

====Singles competition (2007–2008)====
After the conclusion to her feud with Jacqueline, Kim made two minor pay-per-view appearances in a short feud against Robert Roode, before outlasting nine other competitors in a ten-woman gauntlet match to become the inaugural TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Champion on October 14, 2007, at Bound for Glory. She made her first title defense on November 11 at Genesis, where she retained the renamed TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship by defeating Roxxi Laveaux, ODB, and Angel Williams. Kim then began a feud with Awesome Kong over the championship. Their first encounter occurred on December 2 at Turning Point, which resulted in Kim retaining the title due to a disqualification by Kong. On January 6, 2008, at Final Resolution, Kim defeated Kong in an acclaimed second encounter to retain the championship under no disqualification rules. In their third and final encounter in the main event of the January 10 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, Kong defeated Kim to win the TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship, however also suffering a concussion at the hands of Kong after being powerbombed in the ring three times.

Kim competed for the championship on the May 15 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, however failed to win the title. At Slammiversary on June 8, Kim teamed with ODB and Roxxi to defeat The Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky) and Moose in a six woman tag team match. Kim then went on to defeat Love on July 13 at Victory Road. Kim then teamed with ODB and Taylor Wilde to defeat the team of Kong and The Beautiful People on August 10 at Hard Justice, in her last TNA pay-per-view match. Kim&#x27;s final match with TNA aired on the August 21 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; in a losing effort to Kong under street fight rules. Kim left TNA in mid-August 2008 after her contract expired.

===Return to WWE (2008–2011)===
After leaving TNA, Kim re-signed with WWE in late 2008. She made her return as a fan favorite on the March 27, 2009, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, interrupting a WWE Divas Championship match between the villainous Diva&#x27;s Champion, Maryse and Michelle McCool by attacking both competitors. Kim made her in-ring return on the March 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in an 18-Diva tag team match. She made her first WrestleMania appearance in the 25-Diva Miss WrestleMania battle royal on April 5, 2009, at WrestleMania XXV. On the April 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Kim defeated then-Divas Champion Maryse. This earned her a championship match the following week, which she failed to win.

On the June 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kim was traded to the Raw brand as part of a 15 wrestler tri-branded trade between Raw, SmackDown, and ECW. A few weeks later on the August 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, she became number one contender for the Divas title by winning a Fatal 4-Way match against Beth Phoenix, Kelly Kelly, and Alicia Fox. She, however, was unsuccessful in winning the championship on the August 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when she faced then-champion Mickie James. At Bragging Rights on October 25, Kim, with Melina and Kelly Kelly, represented Raw in a losing effort to Michelle McCool, Beth Phoenix, and Natalya, representing SmackDown.

In early 2010, a tournament was held for the newly vacated Divas Championship, and Kim defeated Jillian Hall and Alicia Fox en route to the finals. The finals were held on the February 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which Maryse won to become the new champion. The finals were originally to be held on February 21 at Elimination Chamber, but the match was changed to the team of Maryse and Kim versus Team LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla), which was won by LayCool as a result of Maryse abandoning Kim during the match. Kim was a part of the losing side of a 10-Diva tag team match, against Team LayCool, Alicia Fox, Vickie Guerrero, and Maryse, at WrestleMania XXVI on March 28. At Fatal 4-Way on June 20, Kim challenged for the Divas Championship in a Fatal 4-Way match that also involved then-champion Eve, Maryse, and Alicia Fox, which Fox won to become the champion.

In early 2011, Kim participated in fewer matches on television, as she became the on-screen girlfriend of Daniel Bryan. She also began accompanying him to the ring during his matches. At that time, Bryan was managed by The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie), and after they discovered Bryan kissing Kim backstage, they started a feud with her. The night after the Royal Rumble, Kim accompanied Bryan to ringside for his match against Tyson Kidd. After the match, the Bellas ended their association with Bryan.

For the first half of 2011, Kim feuded with Melina, due to Melina&#x27;s claims that Kim was a &quot;horrible friend&quot;. The matches between the two mainly took place on &quot;Superstars&quot;, and saw Kim emerging victorious in two singles matches on May 30 and June 23. On the August 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kim participated in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the Divas Championship, however, shortly after the match began, she eliminated herself. Kim later explained that WWE had instructed her to get eliminated from the match within the first minute, so she decided to just eliminate herself. On August 5, Kim announced on her Twitter account that she had quit WWE following the incident. Kim later said that WWE did not grant her release, but would instead force her to stay with the promotion for the remainder of her contract. Kim&#x27;s WWE.com profile was removed on September 30, indicating that she had officially left the company, and that her contract expired.

On the November 3 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kim and Rayne defeated TnT (Tara and Brooke Tessmacher) to win the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. The following week they made their first title defense, defeating Velvet Sky and Mickie James. On November 13 at Turning Point, Kim defeated Sky to win the TNA Knockouts Championship for the second time, making her a double champion and only the second woman in TNA history, after her partner Madison Rayne, to hold both the Knockouts and the Knockouts Tag Team titles simultaneously. She made her first title defense on December 11 at Final Resolution, defeating Mickie James following interference from Madison Rayne. On the December 29 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kim retained her title against James following another interference from Rayne.

On June 14, 2016, Kim was announced as the first female inductee into the TNA Wrestling Hall of Fame. Shortly after, on October 2 at Bound for Glory she defeated Maria Kanellis for the Impact Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship, winning the title for the record-tying sixth time which she had to vacate a week later after sustaining a back injury that forced her to take a few months off in-ring competition, during which Kim made a few appearances in November and December as she showed her support for Jade who feuded with Rosemary for the vacant championship.

On the July 6, 2017, episode of the recently rebranded &quot;GFW Impact!&quot;, Kim returned to announce her legit retirement that is about to take place at the end of 2017. A month later, on August 17, at Destination X, Kim faced Sienna for the Unified GFW Knockouts Championship which she was unsuccessful to win due to interference by the return of her old rival Taryn Terrell.

In late–November, Kim was inserted in the feud between Taya Valkyrie and Tessa Blanchard, after the latter had retained her title by attacking the referee. In December, in order to prevent any shenanigans from their upcoming match, Kim was announced as the special guest referee for the next encounter between the two Knockouts, that was set for January 6, 2019, at &quot;Impact Wrestling Homecoming&quot;. At the event, after she attacked Kim multiple times, Blanchard lost the Impact Wrestling Knockouts Championship to Valkyrie after Kim used her finishing move &quot;Eat Defeat&quot; on Tessa Blanchard. Throughout the next few months, the feud between Kim and Blanchard progressed even further as both attacked each other inside and outside the ring (including at the restaurant of Kim&#x27;s husband). This led to the announcement of a match between the two, at &quot;Impact Wrestling Rebellion&quot; on April 28, where Blanchard defeated Kim in what was officially Kim&#x27;s last match.

<text>Ctags is a programming tool that generates an index file (or tag file) of names found in source and header files of various programming languages to aid code comprehension. Depending on the language, functions, variables, class members, macros and so on may be indexed. These tags allow definitions to be quickly and easily located by a text editor, a code search engine, or other utility. Alternatively, there is also an output mode that generates a cross reference file, listing information about various names found in a set of language files in human-readable form.

The original Ctags was introduced in BSD Unix 2.0 and was written by Ken Arnold, with Fortran support by Jim Kleckner and Pascal support by Bill Joy. It is part of the initial release of Single Unix Specification and XPG4 of 1992.

==Editors that support ctags==
&quot;Tag index files&quot; are supported by many source code editors, including:

* Atom
* BBEdit 8+
* CodeLite (via built-in ctagsd language server)
* Cloud9 IDE (uses it internally but does not expose it)
* CygnusEd
* Emacs and XEmacs
* EmEditor Professional
*Far Manager (via Ctags Source Navigator plugin)
* Geany
* Gedit (via gedit-symbol-browser-plugin)
* JED
* jEdit (via plugins CodeBrowser, Tags, ClassBrowser, CtagsSideKick, or Jump)
* JOE
* KDevelop
* Kate
* mcedit (Midnight Commander builtin editor)
* NEdit
* Notepad++ (via OpenCTags plug-in)
* QDevelop
* TSE (via macro)
* TextMate (via CodeBrowser-PlugIn)
* UltraEdit
* TextPad
* VEDIT
* vi (and derivatives such as Elvis, Nvi, Vim, vile, etc.)
* Visual Studio Code
* Xedit (X11)
==Variants of ctags==
There are a few other implementations of the &quot;ctags&quot; program:

===Etags===
GNU Emacs comes with two ctags utilities, etags and ctags, which are compiled from the same source code. Etags generates a tag table file for Emacs, while the ctags command is used to create a similar table in a format understood by vi. They have different sets of command line options:
etags does not recognize and ignores options which only make sense for vi style tag files produced by the ctags command.

===Exuberant Ctags===
Exuberant Ctags, written and maintained by Darren Hiebert until 2009, was initially distributed with Vim, but became a separate project upon the release of Vim 6. It includes support for Emacs and compatibility.

Exuberant Ctags includes support for over 40 programming languages with the ability to add support for even more using regular expressions.

===Universal Ctags===
Universal Ctags is a fork of Exuberant Ctags, with the objective of continuing its development. A few parsers are rewritten to better support the languages.

===Language-specific===
 creates ctags compatible tag files for Haskell source files. It includes support for creating Emacs etags files.

 is a ctags-compatible code indexing solution for JavaScript. It is specialized for JavaScript and uses the CommonJS packaging system. It outperforms &quot;Exuberant Ctags&quot; for JavaScript code, finding more tags than the latter.

==Tags file formats==
There are multiple tag file formats. Some of them are described below. In the following, represents the byte with hexadecimal representation . Every line ends with a line feed (LF, = ).

===Ctags and descendants===
The original &quot;ctags&quot; and the Exuberant/Universal descendants have similar file formats:

====Ctags====
This is the format used by &quot;vi&quot; and various clones. The tags file is normally named &quot;tags&quot;.

The tags file is a list of lines, each line in the format:

 {tagname}\t{tagfile}\t{tagaddress}

The fields are specified as follows:

* } – Any identifier, not containing white space
* – Exactly one tab () character, although many versions of &quot;vi&quot; can handle any amount of white space.
* } – The name of the file where } is defined, relative to the current directory
* } – An ex mode command that will take the editor to the location of the tag. For POSIX implementations of &quot;vi&quot; this may only be a search or a line number, providing added security against arbitrary command execution.

The tags file is sorted on the } field which allows for fast searching of the tags file.

====Extended Ctags====
This is the format used by Vim&#x27;s Exuberant Ctags and Universal Ctags. These programs can generate an original &quot;ctags&quot; file format or an extended format that attempts to retain backward compatibility.

The extended tags file is a list of lines, each line in the format:

 {tagname}\t{tagfile}\t{tagaddress}[;&quot;\t{tagfield...}]

The fields up to and including } are the same as for ctags above.

Optional additional fields are indicated by square brackets (&quot;[...]&quot;) and include:
* – semicolon + double quote: Ends the } in a way that looks like the start of a comment to &quot;vi&quot; or &quot;ex&quot;.
*} – extension fields: tab separated &quot;key:value&quot; pairs for more information.

This format is compatible with non-POSIX &quot;vi&quot; as the additional data is interpreted as a comment. POSIX implementations of &quot;vi&quot; must be changed to support it, however.

===Etags===
This is the format used by Emacs &quot;etags&quot;. The tags file is normally named &quot;TAGS&quot;.

The etags files consists of multiple sections—one section per input source file. Sections are plain-text with several non-printable ascii characters used for special purposes. These characters are represented as underlined hexadecimal codes below.

A section starts with a two line header (the first two bytes make up a magic number):

 \x0c
 {src_file},{size_of_tag_definition_data_in_bytes}

The header is followed by tag definitions, one definition per line, with the format:

 {tag_definition_text}\x7f{tagname}\x01{line_number},{byte_offset}

 can be omitted if the name of the tag can be deduced from the text at the tag definition.

===Example===
Given a single line test.c source code:

 #define CCC(x)

The TAGS (etags) file would look like this:

 \x0c
 test.c,21
 #define CCC(\x7fCCC\x011,0

The tags (ctags) file may look like:

or more flexibly using a search:

<text>Debra Gale Marshall (formerly McMichael and Williams; born March 2, 1960) is an American retired professional wrestling valet, professional wrestler, and actress. She is best known for her time with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) between 1995 and 1998 as Queen Debra and with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) between 1998 and 2002 as simply Debra.

Marshall began her career in professional wrestling in 1995, accompanying her husband Steve &quot;Mongo&quot; McMichael to the ring in WCW. She joined the WWF in 1998, where she managed the tag team of Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart until Hart&#x27;s in-ring death in May 1999. Later that year, she won the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship from Sable in an evening gown match. She later appeared on-screen with her second husband Stone Cold Steve Austin until 2002, when the duo left the company.

==Early life==
Raised in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Marshall became a track-runner, cheerleader, and Homecoming Queen in high school before attending the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in New York City. She then became a flight attendant. Before her involvement in wrestling, she competed and won the title of 1987 Mrs. Illinois America in Elgin, Illinois and went on to compete in the Mrs. America pageant that same year in Las Vegas, Nevada. She later competed and won in the 1992 Mrs. Texas USA pageant held in Houston, Texas and went on to compete in the National Mrs. USA pageant. Marshall also attended the University of Alabama.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== World Championship Wrestling (1995–1997) ===

Marshall first appeared in WCW in late-1995 and early-1996, making occasional unnamed appearances as an audience plant, and as part of a group of valets for the team of Hulk Hogan and &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. In April 1996, she began appearing regularly as a valet for her husband, Steve &quot;Mongo&quot; McMichael as he transitioned from commentator to wrestler. Based on her real-life participation in beauty pageants, Debra took on the role of a beauty-pageant queen character, giving herself the nickname &quot;The Queen of WCW&quot; and often making remarks about other wrestlers and valets in kayfabe interviews.

At The Great American Bash 1996, Steve McMichael and his partner Kevin Greene competed against two of the Four Horsemen (Ric Flair and Arn Anderson). Flair won the match after Mongo and Debra turned on Greene by hitting him with a steel briefcase, joining the 4 Horsemen. She managed the stable with Miss Elizabeth and Woman. The briefcase later became one of Debra&#x27;s signature objects. At Bash at the Beach in July 1997, Debra turned on Mongo during his WCW United States Heavyweight Championship match against Jeff Jarrett by handing Jarrett the steel briefcase, which he then used to knock Mongo out and thus to win the match. Next, Debra briefly managed Goldberg and Alex Wright. On the November 24, 1997 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Wright fired Debra after she accidentally distracted him, causing a loss to Prince Iaukea. After her divorce from McMichael, Debra left WCW.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998–2002) ===

==== Manager of Jeff Jarrett; WWF Women&#x27;s Champion (1998–1999) ====
In October 1998, Marshall rejoined Jarrett in the WWF. At the beginning of her WWF career, known as Debra McMichael and later simply as Debra, she played the part of a shrewd businesswoman, wearing business suits. She also played the part of Jarrett&#x27;s girlfriend. In late 1998, Jarrett began a feud with Goldust that culminated in December at Rock Bottom: In Your House in a &quot;Striptease match&quot;. During the match, Debra hit Goldust over the head with Jarrett&#x27;s trademark guitar, enabling Jarrett to win. WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, disqualified Jarrett, and Debra had to strip due to the match&#x27;s stipulations. As she stripped, The Blue Blazer (Owen Hart) and Jarrett covered her up. Debra, however, began utilizing a new strategy during matches, distracting Jarrett&#x27;s opponents by unbuttoning her blouse. She would willingly take off her blouse to show the crowd her &quot;puppies&quot;, a nickname originally bestowed upon her chest by wrestler Road Dogg and later utilized by commentator Jerry Lawler.

The strategy helped Jarrett and partner Hart defeat The Big Boss Man and Ken Shamrock to become World Tag Team Champions in January 1999. In the same month, she also attempted to cause distraction in a tag match between Jarrett and Hart against Road Dogg and Billy Gunn, but was attacked by Chyna, who was also at ringside. In February, Debra feuded with female professional wrestler Ivory, making her in-ring debut in a mixed tag match on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, which ended in a no contest. Immediately after the bell rang, she attacked Ivory and hit her with Jarrett&#x27;s guitar. The same month, Jarrett and Hart retained the tag title in a tag match against Ivory&#x27;s associates Mark Henry and D&#x27;Lo Brown at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre with Debra&#x27;s assistance. In March, the team lost their tag title to the team of Kane and X-Pac. She also competed in her first singles match, against Ivory but lost via disqualification after Jacqueline and Terri Runnels attacked Ivory during the match. As Debra continued to manage Jarrett and Hart, a potential storyline developed where Hart and Debra would have an affair, but the creative team or Owen himself more likely vetoed the idea before it played out on-screen. A team name was also in the works—Debra favoring &quot;Talent and Attitude&quot; (T&amp;A)—but Hart died in May 1999 at Over the Edge. Later in the event, Debra and Jarrett lost a mixed tag team match against Nicole Bass and Val Venis. Debra and Jarrett were interviewed moments after Hart&#x27;s fall from the rafters at Kemper Arena, where Debra was noticeably shaken and fighting back tears of concern for her friend and was unable to stay in her persona.
On May 2, 1999, Debra was scheduled to take on Sable in a &#x27;Nightgown&#x27; match, but was made to compete against Nicole Bass, against whom she lost. On May 10, 1999, Debra won the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship from Sable in an evening gown match. Usually, in an Evening Gown match, the woman who forcibly removes her opponent&#x27;s dress wins. Because Sable removed Debra&#x27;s dress, she therefore should have been the winner. Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that he considered the woman who had &quot;lost&quot; her dress the winner, crowning Debra the new Women&#x27;s Champion. She held the Women&#x27;s title for a month and eventually lost it to Ivory on June 14, due to interference from Nicole Bass.

At SummerSlam in 1999 Jarrett faced D&#x27;Lo Brown. During the match, Debra and Brown&#x27;s former tag-team partner Mark Henry interfered on Jarrett&#x27;s behalf, allowing him to win both the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship. The following night, Jarrett awarded Henry the European title and gave Debra an assistant, Miss Kitty. Following an attack by Jarrett after losing a mixed tag match against Stephanie McMahon and Test, on September 26, Debra turned on Jarrett at Unforgiven and hit him over the head with a guitar in the middle of his match against Chyna for the Intercontinental Championship. Chyna pinned Jarrett, but referee Tom Prichard overturned the decision due to Debra&#x27;s involvement. On the following episode of &quot;RAW&quot;, Debra participated in an intergender tag match with Chyna against the team of Jarrett and Prichard, in a winning effort.

==== Sporadic appearances (1999–2002) ====

In November 1999, Debra participated in an eight-women Sudden Death match at Survivor Series where she teamed with The Fabulous Moolah, Mae Young, and Tori in a winning effort against Ivory, Jacqueline, Luna Vachon and Terri Runnels which also served as her last appearance as an in-ring performer, despite being trained at the time to compete. Debra subsequently stayed off television while her husband Stone Cold Steve Austin recovered from neck surgery. She reappeared in April 2000, acting as a guest ring announcer at Backlash for the opening match. In the fall of that year she played the role of Lieutenant Commissioner, the assistant of Commissioner Mick Foley.

Debra resigned as Lieutenant Commissioner on the March 5, 2001 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to pursue managing again, while it was revealed on-screen that she was the wife of Stone Cold. Vince McMahon subsequently gave her the duty of managing The Rock, who at the time was feuding with Stone Cold. During the feud, she appeared on an episode of RAW and slapped Vince McMahon. Although she was advertised to be involved in the Wrestlemania 17 main event match between The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, she was later pulled due to both competitors lobbying not to have her out at ringside. After Wrestlemania, she returned on an episode of RAW, questioning Vince McMahon for his role in Stone Cold&#x27;s villainous persona, and subsequently slapping him after he insulted her. During an episode of Smackdown, she appeared in a backstage segment and slapped The Undertaker, who was feuding with Austin at the time. 
By the second half of 2001, Debra accompanied Austin, as he defected to the Alliance, with a running gag about her famous chocolate chip cookies being repulsive (although Debra herself remained oblivious to this). On an episode of RAW, Debra was subject to a bucket of milk accidentally falling on her, which was a miscommunication by Stacy Keibler and Shawn Stasiak who meant to play the prank on Kurt Angle. The following week, Debra beat up Keibler with a tray of cookies in a backstage segment.
In August, during an episode of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;, Debra also clocked Stone Cold in frustration with a cookie tray in the middle of the ring. The next week on &quot;RAW&quot;, she accompanied her husband to the ring for a match against Matt Hardy, and was involved in a physical altercation with Lita during the match.

In 2002, Debra was involved in a major backstage brawl with Stephanie McMahon after arguing over their respective husbands. Debra appeared sporadically thereafter in backstage segments, notably slapping Ric Flair in a backstage segment in April on an episode of RAW. She left the company in June 2002 after her last RAW appearance with Austin, fanning the flames of their well-publicized marital fallout.

Following domestic abuse charges against Austin and arrest, Austin eventually returned to WWE in 2003. Debra, however, was never invited back. References of Debra were subsequently dropped from WWE programming and media altogether, although, in 2021, she was acknowledged by WWE.com in a list of female performers who made an impact outside the ring.

==Other media==
Before becoming involved in wrestling, Marshall studied acting in Texas. Her first acting jobs involved commercials and two music videos for country musician George Strait. She also had a small role in the 1995 film &quot;The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; as a police officer. The producers originally offered her the lead in the film, but when the director&#x27;s first choice changed her mind and accepted the role, Marshall was given the small role instead.

On March 10, 2002, Marshall appeared on an episode of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; alongside several other members of the WWE roster. In addition, she has a role in the 2010 film &quot;Gathering of Heroes&quot;.

==Personal life==
Marshall&#x27;s marriage to National Football League alumnus and professional wrestler Steve McMichael lasted thirteen years. McMichael&#x27;s mother, whom Marshall met on an airplane, set up their first meeting as a blind date. They divorced on October 12, 1998.

Debra met Steven Williams, known on-screen as Stone Cold Steve Austin, in 1998; they moved in together in 2000. On September 13 of that year, they married at The Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, and she changed her name to Debra Williams. On June 15, 2002, police responded to a call to the couple&#x27;s residence in San Antonio, Texas, and found Debra with bruises and a bloody nose. On August 14, the authorities arrested Austin and charged him with misdemeanor assault. He pleaded no contest on November 25 and received a year&#x27;s probation, a $1,000 fine, and an order to carry out eighty hours of community service. Austin filed for divorce from Marshall on July 22, 2002, and the divorce was finalized on February 5, 2003. Marshall later auctioned her wedding ring off on eBay for $27,100 and donated a portion of the proceeds to &quot;Safe Place&quot;, an organization which assists the victims of domestic abuse.

In June and July 2007, Marshall made several appearances to discuss the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide. She described steroids and drugs as the cause of Austin hitting her in June 2002 and suggested links between such substances and the death of Benoit and his family. She also alleged that Austin beat her three times. However, she maintains a cordial relationship with Austin following the divorce.

Marshall graduated cum laude from the University of Alabama with an undergraduate interdisciplinary degree in 2013. In December 2017, she was awarded a Master of Science degree in criminal justice from the University of Alabama. While working on her master&#x27;s of science degree, Marshall was awarded the University of Alabama College of Arts and Science&#x27;s Mary Avis Todd Award for &quot;outstanding work in community studies&quot;.

<text>Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine is a falling block puzzle video game developed by Compile and published by Sega. It was released for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive and Game Gear in 1993 and ported to the Master System in 1994.

The game is a Westernised version of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; (1991), and replaces its characters with those from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise, primarily the &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; animated series. The &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; character Carbuncle appears under the name &quot;Has Bean&quot; and makes different animations depending on how the player plays the game. The gameplay is similar to puzzle games such as &quot;Tetris&quot;, in which the player organises coloured shapes as they descend a board. The plot sees &quot;Sonic&quot; antagonist Doctor Robotnik kidnapping residents from Beanville and turning them into robots. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay but criticising the difficulty.

==Premise and gameplay==
The game is set on the planet Mobius, which is inhabited by bean-like creatures. Doctor Robotnik conceives a plan to bring terror to the world by kidnapping the citizens of Beanville and turning them into robot slaves, and eventually creating an army that will help him rid the planet of fun and joy. To achieve this, he creates the &quot;Mean Bean-Steaming Machine&quot; in order to transform the bean-like creatures into robots. Putting his plan into motion, Robotnik sends out his Henchbots to gather all the bean-like creatures and group them together in dark dungeons so they can be sent to the Mean Bean-Steaming Machine. The rest of the game&#x27;s story revolves around the player character, &quot;Has Bean&quot;, and their journey to stop Robotnik&#x27;s henchmen by breaking into the dungeons and freeing the bean-like creatures.

&quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot; is based on &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot;, an Asian falling-block puzzle game. In the story, players must rescue Beanville from Dr. Robotnik and his army of Badniks. In Scenario Mode, the player plays against 13 increasingly challenging computer opponents. In the multiplayer 1P vs 2P Mode, two players battle against each other, and in Exercise Mode, players can simply practice. The Game Gear and Master System versions feature an additional mode, Puzzle Mode, in which players must attempt to clear predetermined sets of beans. On each player&#x27;s grid, groups of beans fall from the top of the screen and can be moved and rotated until they reach the bottom. When four beans of the same colour are matched together, they disappear from the grid, causing any beans above to drop. These beans can trigger other matches, resulting in chain combos. By performing chain combos, players can send grey &quot;refugee beans&quot; to hinder their opponent. These beans cannot be matched normally and can only be removed by completing a match adjacent to them. A player loses when beans spill over the top of the board, leaving them unable to add more beans into the grid.

== Levels and characters ==
All 13 characters have a different strategy of gameplay. For example, Coconuts puts beans towards the sides of the grid. All these characters cameo in the &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; episode &quot;Super Special Sonic Search and Smash Squad&quot;. Coconuts, Grounder, Scratch, and Dr. Robotnik himself are the main antagonists of the &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.

All the characters come in this order:
==Development and release==
&quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot; is a Westernised version of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; (1991), a Japanese falling-block puzzle game developed by Compile and released for the MSX2 in 1991. Fearing that the game would not be popular with Western audiences, Sega replaced the characters of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; with those from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise, particularly those from the 1993 &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; animated series. An 8-bit version was also released for the Game Gear in the same year and the Master System in the following year, adapted from the Japanese &quot;Nazo Puyo&quot; game.

&quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot; has also appeared in retrospective compilations, such as the &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; for the GameCube in 2002, &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004; which also contains the Game Gear version, and &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (known as &quot;Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection&quot; in Europe) for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2009. In 2006, Sega released the game on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console. In 2010, it was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam. In June 2013, the Game Gear version was released for the Nintendo 3DS via its Virtual Console emulation service. In 2021, it was released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

==Reception==

&quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot; received generally positive reviews. It holds an average score of 7.8/10 at Metacritic, based on an aggregate of 13 reviews.

Critics praised the various aspects of gameplay, although the puzzle genre&#x27;s difficulty and overuse were negative factors. Andy Dyer from &quot;Mega&quot; acknowledged that the game had a simple concept and also observed that it did not provide enough of a challenge. Lucas Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; enjoyed the game&#x27;s array of puzzles and recognised that its design was intended to encourage two-player competition. Reviewing the Mega Drive version, Damien McFerran of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; similarly echoed Thomas&#x27; opinion of the game&#x27;s intention to encourage two-player competition, and also noted that it provided a &quot;decent&quot; challenge despite viewing that a single player could get bored easily. In contrast, Andrew Webster of &quot;Gamezebo&quot; criticised the high level of difficulty and the game&#x27;s general accessibility due to its &quot;ancient&quot; password save system. Aaron Thomas of &quot;GameSpot&quot; found the game difficult to recommend due to the availability of free &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; clones on the PC, but commended its basic mechanics, a wide range of game modes, and gradually increasing difficulty. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; Kristan Reed labelled the game as a &quot;fairly unapologetic reskin&quot; of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; and thought that Sega decided to &quot;shoehorn&quot; it into the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise in order to enhance their sales, although Reed admitted the gameplay was solid and addictive. A reviewer from &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; questioned the game&#x27;s originality, saying that &quot;stacking beans to make them disappear is not a new concept&quot; but would still satisfy fans of the genre. Amanda Tipping from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; thought that the game was as addictive and as puzzling as the &quot;Tetris&quot; series, and also preferred the game&#x27;s colourful visuals as opposed to &quot;Tetris&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewer Andromeda found the game most enjoyable when using an offensive strategy.

The Game Gear version was well received. In a retrospective review, Ron DelVillano from &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; praised the game&#x27;s wide variety of game modes but noted the soundtrack&#x27;s lack of diversity. DelVillano also thought that the graphics had not aged well as of 2013, but accepted that games in the puzzle genre did not require prominent visuals. In a similar vein, a reviewer from &quot;&quot; opined that the game&#x27;s graphics were not &quot;a joy&quot; to look at, but understood that it was &quot;normal&quot; for a game of that genre. Neal Ronaghan of &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; lauded the game&#x27;s addictive and &quot;fun&quot; puzzle gameplay but admitted it contained flaws due to the limitations of the Game Gear. In 1995, &quot;Mega Zone&quot; included the game in their &quot;Top 50 Games in History&quot;.

<text>In typography, the ransom note effect is the result of using an excessive number of juxtaposed typefaces. It takes its name from the appearance of a stereotypical ransom note or poison pen letter, with the message formed from words or letters cut randomly from a magazine or a newspaper in order to avoid using recognizable handwriting. 

The term is also used in a pejorative manner to describe poor typesetting or layout created by an untrained Web developer or desktop publishing user. The software industry discovered that the drawback to placing &quot;professional publishing tools&quot; in the hands of &quot;people with no graphic design&quot; training or education was that &quot;all too often users mixed all sorts of things together, just because they could&quot;. However, the problem has long been recognized in classical typography and examples of such layouts can be found in handbills from the 18th and 19th centuries. 

Early versions of Macintosh system software, up through System 7, included a bitmapped font called San Francisco that replicated the ransom note effect. The font was not carried over into later versions of Mac OS. Microsoft similarly had a Ransom typeface commissioned in 1992.

The ransom note effect may also occur when a web browser uses different fonts to display parts of a web page in different languages or encodings (or if a language uses glyphs from different code blocks, as is the case with Ancient Greek). To avoid this, web browsers try to use the same font for as much of the page as possible.

<text>Motif description is the term that has been used for a form of dance notation; however, the current preferred terminology is Motif Notation. It is a subset and reconception of Labanotation sharing a common lexis. The main difference between the two forms is the type of information they record.

* Labanotation: Detailed description of movement so it may be reproduced exactly as it was performed or conceived.
* Motif description: Depicts the most important elements, the essential aspects of the movement sequence.

Motif description is often used as an alternative to Labanotation when information needs to be written down quickly.

<doc id="690131" wikidata="Q798696" url="?curid=690131" title="Bad Girls (1994 film)">
<text>Bad Girls is a 1994 American Western film directed by Jonathan Kaplan, and written by Ken Friedman and Yolande Turner. It stars Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson, Andie MacDowell, and Drew Barrymore. The film follows four former prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and prison escape, who later encounter difficulties involving bank robbery and Pinkerton detectives.

The film was originally conceived as a feminist Western and a low-budget independent film, until producers Albert Ruddy and André Morgan brought in 20th Century Fox. The involvement of a major studio substantially increased the film&#x27;s budget and necessitated the casting of big-name actresses. Principal photography began in July 1993 in Sonora, California with director Tamra Davis at the helm, but shortly into filming, producers fired Davis and reconceptualized the movie to be more of an action film. Jonathan Kaplan was hired to replace Davis.

&quot;Bad Girls&quot; opened in North American theaters on April 22, 1994. It received largely negative reviews and was a box office disappointment, with critics opining that the film squandered its encouraging premise and misused its four female leads.

==Plot==
Cody, Anita, Eileen and Lily work together in a brothel. When Anita is abused by a customer, Cody kills the man after he opens fire on her. Narrowly escaping from a lynch mob, they are pursued by Pinkerton detectives hired by the widow of the coronel Cody shot. A man they meet on the road, McCoy, warns them of the pursuit.

They discuss riding to Oregon and starting a new life by taking up the claim to land inherited by Anita when her husband died of cholera. Cody offers to fund their new start from savings she has accumulated over the years.

Going to the bank where Cody&#x27;s savings are held, as she tries to close her account and make a withdrawal, the Pinkerton detectives catch up with her and try to arrest her. Leaving the bank manager&#x27;s office, they find themselves in the middle of a bank robbery being staged by Kid Jarrett, a former lover of Cody&#x27;s. He helps her escape from arrest, but takes her money and tells her to find him.

During the escape, Eileen is arrested. Cody decides to go after the money and Kid Jarrett, telling Anita and Lily to wait in hiding. Instead, they return to town to break Eileen out of jail.

Cody&#x27;s meeting with Kid Jarrett and his father Frank Jarrett does not go well. As Kid Jarrett has not forgiven her for running out on him, he flogs her. Later, she is found unconscious by McCoy, who brings her to a healer in town and puts the Pinkerton detectives off her trail.

McCoy, Cody and the other three women meet up on the ranch of a farmer who&#x27;d been guarding Eileen&#x27;s cell (and whom they&#x27;d tricked into releasing her). Cody plans revenge on Kid Jarrett. They foil a train robbery and steal his loot, at the cost of Lily being abducted. In turn, they abduct Frank Jarrett.

Regrouping again on the ranch, Anita leaves the others, frustrated with their revenge-motivated misadventures. She goes to a lawyer in town and finds out that the claim is only valid in the hands of her husband - as a woman, she cannot claim the land in Oregon.

Frank Jarrett antagonizes his captors until McCoy shoots him. Angry over it, Cody sends McCoy away. Meanwhile, Lily is being raped by her captors. When McCoy stages a one-man rescue attempt, he is captured, but Lily escapes.

Reunited, Cody, Anita and Eileen go to rescue Lily and meet her on the road. When she tells them that McCoy has been captured, they continue towards Kid Jarrett&#x27;s hideout, and offer to trade the stolen loot for McCoy, who has been flogged and tortured. Kid agrees, then shoots McCoy as soon as the loot is handed over. He gives Cody the money he stole from her.

While retreating, one of Lily&#x27;s would-be rapists taunts her, triggering a shootout that results in the deaths of Kid&#x27;s entire gang.

After the shootout, Eileen marries the rancher, while Lily, Cody and Anita head west to start a new life, mentioning the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896. On the trail, they overtake the Pinkerton detectives, who do not see them.

==Cast==
==Production==
The original director was Tamra Davis. The script, written by Yolande Finche and Davis&#x27; close friend Becky Johnston, was envisioned as an artsy film that would &quot;foreground the political themes of the Western&quot;. Davis lobbied for New Line Cinema to make the film with her as the director. The budget was initially set at $6 million. The project was abandoned until 20th Century Fox agreed to finance it, assigning producers Albert Ruddy and André Morgan to be in charge. The film then became a high-profile production with name actresses in talks to star, and the budget was upped to $16.5 million.

Just before filming began in Sonora, California, Davis was handed a 75-page script rewrite, and the actresses reportedly received only one day&#x27;s worth of weapons training and a minimal amount of rehearsal time. Nine days into filming, Davis was fired. Ruddy and Morgan maintained that the reasoning was Davis falling behind schedule, but reports also speculated that in contrast to Davis&#x27; vision, the studio wanted a &quot;sexier version of the $43 million-grossing &quot;Young Guns&quot;&quot;. Madeleine Stowe told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; at the time, &quot;Tamra had nothing to work with. There is no director, given the kind of production she was given, who could have come up with what they wanted.&quot; Co-star Dermot Mulroney said the studio had been dissatisfied when the dailies showed &quot;women just sitting around, and they paid for this big action film&quot;.

In the wake of Davis&#x27; firing, Fox hired producer Lynda Obst, director Jonathan Kaplan, cinematographer Ralf Bode, and screenwriter Ken Friedman. The budget then went up to $20 million. Production was shut down for three weeks, during which the script was rewritten to be more action-oriented and the principal cast attended a &quot;cowboy camp&quot; supervised by stunt coordinator Walter Scott. Discussing the studio&#x27;s hiring changes, Obst said, &quot;Jonathan is like a woman. His &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot; was the first feminist movie that knocked me out. He&#x27;s more of a feminist than I am. I kept saying, &#x27;Women do not want to ride into the sunset without men. We like men.&#x27;&quot; Obst later expressed that the studio&#x27;s meddling had made for a troublesome production.

Stowe said, &quot;I had actually liked the first script very much and would never have agreed to do it otherwise. But I guess it wasn&#x27;t translating.&quot; Stowe later recalled the shoot as an unpleasant experience, with the only positive being that it introduced her to Texas, where she later bought a home.

The railroad scenes were filmed on the Sierra Railroad in Tuolumne County, California. When filming resumed with Kaplan, the production moved to Brackettville, Texas for eight weeks.

The ending of &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was reshot after negative test screenings. Said Mary Stuart Masterson, &quot;The [original] story was more about each of us getting our money and going our separate ways.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s music was written by Jerry Goldsmith, who composed the music as a cross between the style of his 1960s westerns and a contemporary sound. The soundtrack has been released twice; through 20th Century Fox Film Scores on 10 May 1994 and an extended, limited edition through La-La Land Records and Fox Music on 28 June 2011.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Bad Girls&quot; received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics upon its release and currently holds a 13% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews, with an average score of 3.6/10. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave &quot;Bad Girls&quot; a grade of &quot;B-&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

On April 22, 1994, Roger Ebert wrote for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;: &quot;What a good idea, to make a Western about four tough women. And what a sad movie.&quot; He concluded, &quot;The failure of &#x27;Bad Girls&#x27; is all the more poignant because the actresses are at the top of their forms right now, and could have been inspired by a more ambitious production. Think of Stowe in &#x27;Blink,&#x27; MacDowell in &#x27;Four Weddings And A Funeral,&#x27; Masterson in &#x27;Fried Green Tomatoes,&#x27; Barrymore in &#x27;Gun Crazy.&#x27; Better still, see them in those films, and reflect how lame they seem in this concoction.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; ridiculed the film as &quot;Cowpoke Barbie&quot; and commented the only positive aspect to the film was its cast. Maslin said Stowe gives the film&#x27;s most interesting performance, but she lamented Masterson has so little to do. She also commented &quot;Jonathan Kaplan directs &#x27;Bad Girls&#x27; in a surprisingly stilted manner, without the slightest feel for the western genre in either its traditional or neo-feminist forms. The film feels stiff and looks awkward, despite Mr. Kaplan&#x27;s usually serious, accomplished way of telling a story.&quot;

&quot;The Morning Call&quot; praised the film&#x27;s production values, saying &quot;the authentic-appearing sets give one a sense of the 1890s west in the waning days of the American frontier. Filter-laden cinematography imparts a lived-in, burnished look to the west Texas landscape where the movie was partly made&quot;. It said &quot;the best performance among the female leads is by Drew Barrymore, as Lilly Laronette, who chews the tobacco out of the pulp fiction script&quot;, but lamented that the film squanders the talents of Stowe, MacDowell, and Masterson.

In a retrospective review for &quot;Grantland&quot;, Molly Lambert wrote, &quot;&quot;Bad Girls&quot; is a campy romp that’s never very much fun. Madeleine Stowe has the most to do as tomboy Cody Zamora, Andie MacDowell is better than usual as a Southern belle madame, Mary Stewart Masterson wears prairie dresses, and Drew Barrymore shows her boobs.&quot; She added the outcome &quot;is particularly disappointing because a Western about four prostitutes swearing vengeance has so much potential&quot;.

===Box office===
The film opened in the number 1 position with $5,012,200, but dropped to number 4 in its second week of release. The film grossed $15,240,435 in the United States and Canada and $23 million worldwide.

<doc id="690139" wikidata="Q241545" url="?curid=690139" title="Nene Pimentel">
<text>Aquilino Quilinging Pimentel Jr. (, December 11, 1933 – October 20, 2019), commonly known as Nene Pimentel, was a Filipino politician and human rights lawyer who was one of the leading political opposition leaders during the regime of Ferdinand Marcos from the declaration of martial law in 1972 until the People Power Revolution in 1986, which removed Marcos from power. He co-founded the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan (PDP–Laban) and served as the President of the Senate of the Philippines from 2000 to 2001. He is the father of incumbent senator and former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III. In 2018, Pimentel was identified by the Human Rights Victims&#x27; Claims Board as a Motu Proprio human rights violations victim of the Martial Law Era.

==Early life==
Nene Pimentel was born on December 11, 1933, to Aquilino &quot;Aquio&quot; E. Pimentel Sr. (January 4, 1909 – November 8, 1987), a lawyer from Cagayan de Oro, and Petra Quilinging (July 27, 1911 – May 11, 1956), a public school teacher from Batac, Ilocos Norte. He married Lourdes &quot;Bing&quot; de la Llana on April 30, 1960, and they had six children, including Aquilino Pimentel III.

==Political career==
===Delegate to the 1971 Constitutional Convention===
In 1971, Pimentel rose to national prominence as an elected delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1971, representing Misamis Oriental. The nature of the Constitutional Convention changed when then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972. Pimentel and a few like-minded delegates feared the Constitutional Convention would produce a Marcos-scripted Constitution and were vocal in their opposition. Pimentel also protested certain provisions as being contrary to the people&#x27;s interest. In the subsequent roundup of those who opposed Marcos, he was arrested in early 1973 and jailed for three months at Camp Crame. Pimentel, who had a young family, bade his wife Bing &quot;Be brave. Don’t cry,&quot; and submitted to the incarceration. He was released from prison in time for the signing of the Constitution. Along with a few other delegates, Pimentel refused to sign the Constitution.

He then went to work as a lawyer for the National Secretariat for Social Action of the Catholic Bishops Conference.

===1978 interim Batasang Pambansa elections===
In April 1978, Pimentel ran for a post in the Interim Batasan elections as an official candidate of the Laban party of Metro Manila with Benigno S. Aquino Jr. Members of Marcos&#x27; KBL party swept the seats. Pimentel and other opposition leaders like Senator Lorenzo Tañada, Francisco Soc Rodrigo, Tito Guingona, Archie Intengan SJ, and Chino Roces loudly protested the defeat of all opposition candidates and denounced the massive cheating that had taken place. Pimentel was one of those arrested for leading a demonstration against what he termed farcical elections. He had spoken out against Marcos&#x27; bid to produce a rubber stamp legislature to win legitimacy for his iron-fisted regime which was increasingly being criticized here and abroad. Pimentel was jailed for two months in Camp Bicutan in Taguig, Metro Manila.

Pimentel&#x27;s second stint in prison did not silence him. In fact, it strengthened his resolve to fight for freedom and to oppose electoral fraud. Ever the parliamentarian, he brought the battle from the streets to the polls in January 1980 when Marcos allowed local elections.

===Mayor of Cagayan de Oro===
His wife Bing recalled they launched his mayoralty bid in Cagayan de Oro with a mere in his war chest – all the money the couple could muster. But Cagayanons who believed in him contributed to his campaign and penned his name on their ballot. Pimentel won by a 3–1 margin over his KBL rival, who was fielded by Marcos. Pimentel ran under the coalition banner of the National Union for Democracy and Freedom and the Mindanao Alliance which busted KBL dominance in Misamis Oriental. He and his entire slate of candidates for vice mayor and seven city councilors swept the elections in Cagayan de Oro. His candidates for governor and vice governor also won.

Pimentel was not to govern his city unhindered. In 1981, while he was on a five-week training course in the United States, the COMELEC ousted him for &quot;political turncoatism&quot;, installing the KBL candidate as mayor. The COMELEC cited Pimentel for switching from Laban in April 1978 to the Narional Union for Democracy and Freedom in December 1979 and then running as candidate of the Mindanao Alliance in January 1980.

The COMELEC&#x27;s move ired the Cagayanons. Pimentel partisans immediately staged peaceful demonstrations to express their displeasure. About 30 of his supporters also started fasting in protest. Six days later, 10,000 of his supporters marched around the city in a nonviolent show of support for Pimentel who was then on an official trip to the US. Thousands more lined the streets to cheer them on. This first-ever demonstration of &quot;People Power&quot; came at a time when Marcos did not lightly tolerate dissent.

Meanwhile, in Manila, Pimentel&#x27;s lawyer, headed by opposition leaders former senators Lorenzo Tañada and Soc Rodrigo, along with Abraham Sarmiento, Raul Gonzales and Joker Arroyo, claimed that the COMELEC had acted without jurisdiction and contented that the electorate&#x27;s will should be respected. The COMELEC, however, reaffirmed its decision to oust Pimentel.

The conflict made national headlines and photos of demonstrations in Cagayan de Oro appeared in a major daily. To defuse the escalating turmoil, Marcos engineered a truce and reinstalled Pimentel as mayor, pending a Supreme Court decision. Pimentel arrived from the US in time to pick up the reins of city government that had briefly been wrested from him.

In 1983, while he was in Cebu City, Pimentel was arrested on charges of rebellion and was detained. He had allegedly given P100 to New People&#x27;s Army commander. Bing Pimentel recalled it was horrible time as the family did not know where he was. They traced him to Camp Sergio Osmeña and later to Camp Cabahug in the City of Cebu. Even as he was held in the military detention centers, his followers from Cagayan de Oro and other parts of the country visited him by the hundreds to boost his morale and keep his spirits high.

Nene Pimentel disputed the charges and was later released. Returning home, he was mobbed by thousand of his supporters upon his arrival at the pier of Cagayan de Oro. Later, he was again arrested for allegedly engaging in ambuscades. His supporters contributed centavos and pesos in small denomination to bail him out. Subsequently, Pimentel was placed under house arrest which lasted for almost seven months.

===Assemblyman for Batasang Pambansa===
From the confines of his home, Pimentel continued to keep abreast of national news. He helped rally the opposition, ran the city and launched his bid as assemblyman for the Batasang Pambansa. He was, if anything, not quiet. He protested relentlessly and fearlessly against injustice, fraud, corruption and Marcos&#x27; dictatorial rule.

Then, in the aftermath of the assassination of Marcos&#x27;s chief rival, Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr. in 1983, Pimentel won a seat in the 1984 Philippine parliamentary election, but the Marcos government ousted him on the allegation that he had cheated in the elections. The Supreme Court itself recounted the ballots in an electoral contest.

The feisty Pimentel, a relentless critic of the Marcos regime, was often seen with Ninoy&#x27;s widow, Cory, as they rallied the opposition. At one point, Cory asked him to be her running mate in the 1986 Philippine presidential election and he agreed. However, when Cardinal Jaime Sin brokered a political marriage between Cory and Salvador &quot;Doy&quot; Laurel, Pimentel graciously stepped aside and let history run its course.

Upon her ascent to power after the People Power Revolution, President Aquino appointed Pimentel as Minister of Local Government. He had the unenviable task of dismantling the structure of dictatorship and corruption left behind by the Marcos regime. Pimentel wielded the axe deliberately, gaining a breathing space for the new administration. His critics alleged he had sold positions in the new government, but none could make the charge stick. Pimentel incurred the ire of some but also the respect of those who saw that he did it without fear or favor or taint of corruption.

==Senator (1987–1992)==
===First term: 1987–1992===

Pimentel then was elected Senator in 1987, finishing 20th, serving a five-year term until 1992. He authored the seminal Local Government Code of 1991. As Senator, he authored and sponsored several key pieces of legislation, among them the Local Government Code of 1991, the Cooperative Code, the Philippine Sports Commission Act, the Act Creating the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and the People&#x27;s Small-Scale Mining Act. He also authored and co-sponsored the Generic Drugs Act and the Act Establishing the Philippine Police under a Reorganized Department of Interior and Local Government.

On November 24, 1990, Pimentel was riding a six-seater plane to Naga City to deliver a speech on the proposed Local Government Code when an engine malfunctioned during the plane&#x27;s descent in stormy weather, but the pilot, Capt. Edgardo Lopez, was able to maneuver around a mountain and land safely at Naga Airport. On September 16, 1991, Pimentel was among the &quot;Magnificent 12&quot; senators who voted against the extension of the PH-US Bases Treaty. 

He also authored the RA 6975, or the DILG Act that created the civilian Philippine National Police.

===Vice Presidential Bid and a 1995 attempt to return to the Senate (1992–1998)===

Pimentel then launched a bid for the vice presidency in 1992, running under the Liberal Party–PDP–Laban coalition with Jovito Salonga running for president. However, he lost to fellow Senator Joseph Estrada, finishing fifth among the vice presidential candidates by garnering 9.9% of the vote.

Pimentel was defeated in the 1995 national elections after running for another term for the Senate placing on number 15. He then took the case to the Supreme Court eventually winning the suit in 2004.

==Return to the Senate (1998–2010)==
In 1998, Pimentel ran successfully for another term in the Senate of the Philippines, from 1998 to 2004. Along with Edgardo Angara and Juan Ponce Enrile, Pimentel is one of the three senators elected in 1987 to return to the Senate.

He was re-elected in the May 10, 2004, National Elections attaining the third highest number of votes nationally of nearly 80 candidates for 12 Senate seats.

During his term (1998–2010) at the Senate, Pimentel authored several bills and resolutions, some of which have already been enacted into law:

*R.A. No.7160, The Local Government Code in 1991;

*R.A. No. 6938, The Cooperative Code; 

*R.A. No. 6678, The Generic Drugs Act; 

*R.A. No. 6734, An Act Creating the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao;

===Senate President (2000–2001)===

In October 2000, Senate President Franklin Drilon issued a statement about the &quot;Juetengate scandal&quot; of President Joseph Estrada. Drilon was removed as Senate President the next month through a Senate revamp and Pimentel was installed as Senate President. In December 2000, an impeachment case was filed on the Senate. On January 16, 2001, Pimentel was one of those who voted in favor of the opening of the second bank envelope. Their vote was outnumbered and some of the opposition senators cried in front of Senate President Pimentel. Joseph Estrada was ousted in January by the second EDSA People Power Revolution, but he was pardoned by his successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on October 26, 2007. Pimentel occupied the Senate presidency until the end of the regular session in June 2001. As he explained his vote to open he declared: 

Before stepping down as senator, Pimentel made a final privilege speech, where he demanded the American government and the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago to return to the Philippines the Golden Tara, one of the most significant artifacts in the entire country which landed in American possession during the financial crisis in the Philippines.

===Blue Ribbon Committee Chair===
As chair of the Blue Ribbon Committee, he has recommended the prosecution of top government officials of previous administrations in relation to the Expo Pilipino centennial scam and the misuse of the funds of the Retirement and Separation Benefits Systems of the Armed Forces. He has also recommended the prosecution of certain personnel of the Land Registration Administration for involvement in faking of land titles. Recently his committee also conducted series of investigations into the allegation of Governor Luis &quot;Chavit&quot; Singson on jueteng scandal. As Chair of the Committee on Local Government, he has supported far-reaching amendments to further strengthen the role of local government units in national development. He has also gotten senate approval to return the police to the supervision of LGUs and has authored a law to fix the date for elections of ARMM officials.

He was the president and founder of the PDP–Laban party. On April 25, 2008, Senator Pimentel authored a bill that would shift the Philippines into a Federal Republic of the Philippines.

==Post-Senate career==
Nene Pimentel left office on June 30, 2010, after serving three Senate terms and briefly as Senate President.

Pimentel remained active in political life, taking on the role of elder statesman - continuing to criticise authoritarianism, human rights violations, and the Marcoses.

Nene Pimentel was a proponent of federalism in the Philippines. He has proposed 5 states in Luzon (North Luzon, Cordillera, Central Luzon, Southern Tagalog, and Bicol), 1 federal capital (Metro Manila), 4 states in Visayas (East Visayas, Central Visayas, Western Visayas, and Minparom), and 3-4 states in Mindanao (Bangsamoro, Southern Mindanao, and Northern Mindanao - which may be divided into Northeast Mindanao and Northwest Mindanao). He also proposed the establishment of two autonomous regions within the proposed Bangsamoro federal state, as the Muslims of the Sulu archipelago do not want to be lumped with the Muslims of mainland Mindanao due to their distinct culture.

== Politically active descendants ==
His son Aquilino &quot;Koko&quot; Pimentel III ran for Senator in 2007. In 2010, his daughter Gwen made a senatorial race attempt under the Nacionalista Party coalition and a member of the PDP–Laban.

The following year, Koko was proclaimed senator after Migz Zubiri resigned from the Senate. He got his full term in 2013 under Team PNoy. He then served as Senate President from 2016 to 2018. Nene supported President Rodrigo Duterte during the election campaign.

==Death==
On October 14, 2019, Pimentel was admitted to the intensive care unit of an undisclosed hospital in Metro Manila. His daughter, Gwendolyn, reported that he was experiencing difficulty in breathing due to pneumonia. A family statement described that Pimentel was &quot;very ill&quot;.

On October 20, his son, Senator Koko Pimentel, announced that his father had died at around 5 a.m. (PST) due to complications from lymphoma. He was 85 and two months shy of his 86th birthday. The elder Pimentel&#x27;s wake was held at the Heritage Memorial Park in Taguig from October 20 to 22 and from October 25 to 26, at the Senate of the Philippines session hall on October 23, and at the Cagayan De Oro City Hall from October 23 to 25. His remains were laid to rest at The Heritage Park in Taguig on October 26.

<doc id="690141" wikidata="Q4840295" url="?curid=690141" title="Bad Girls (Voigt novel)">
<text>Bad Girls is a young-adult novel by Cynthia Voigt, first published in 1997. It follows two fifth-graders, Michelle &quot;Mikey&quot; Elsinger and Margalo Epps, exploring issues of friendship, courage, and ethics using the lens of these two girls who are ambitious, combative, intelligent, and independent in ways that break from the norm. Voigt uses the concept of &quot;bad&quot;-ness here in somewhat the way Nietzsche deals with good and evil in his &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, debunking some of our socially constructed values (in this case, surrounding gender) rather than merely embracing the dark side.

The novel has been translated into Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish, and Spanish.

==Sequels==
Sequels in the &quot;Bad Girls&quot; series include &quot;Bad, Badder, Baddest&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s Not Easy Being Bad&quot;; &quot;Bad Girls in Love&quot;; and &quot;Bad Girls, Bad Girls, Whatcha Gonna Do?&quot; which will reportedly be the last in the series. Each book takes the two girls through one grade.

<doc id="690147" wikidata="Q874223" url="?curid=690147" title="Regions of Eritrea">
<text>The regions of Eritrea are the primary geographical divisions through which Eritrea is administered. Six in total, they include the Central, Anseba, Gash-Barka, Southern, Northern Red Sea and Southern Red Sea regions.

At the time of independence in 1993 Eritrea was arranged into ten provinces. These provinces were similar to the nine provinces operating during the colonial period. In 1996, these were consolidated into six regions (&quot;zobas&quot;). Gash-Barka Region is the largest and sparsely populated region and is called the &quot;bread-basket&quot;.

The People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice or PFDJ (originally Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front) rules the country and its regions as a single-party totalitarian government. The regional and local elections are conducted on a periodic basis on a restricted framework. All men and women of any ethnic or religious background are eligible to vote. No parties or groups other than PFDJ are allowed to contest and the elections are presided by representatives from PFDJ.

==History==
At the time of independence in 1993 Eritrea was arranged into ten provinces and they were Asmara (the capital of Eritrea), Akele Guzay, Barka, Denkalia, Gash-Setit, Hamasien, Sahel, Semhar, Senhit and Seraye. These provinces were similar to the nine provinces operating during the colonial period. In 1996, these were consolidated into six regions (&quot;zobas&quot;). The boundaries of these new regions are based on catchment basins. Critics of this policy contend that the Government of Eritrea was erasing the historical fabric of Eritrea while proponents believe that these new Regional boundaries would ease historical land disputes. Furthermore proponents of this policy argue that basing boundaries on an important natural resource would ease the planning of its use.

==Administration==
Each region has a locally elected regional assembly while the local administrator is appointed by the President of Eritrea. During Cabinet meetings the President also meets with the Regional Administrators who report on the activities of their regions. The Regional Assemblies are charged with developing a budget for local programs and hearing the concerns of the local populations. Local programs included cultural events, infrastructure such as feeder roads, and to promote afforestation. Eritrea has a single-party National Assembly governed by the People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice or PFDJ (originally Eritrean Liberation Front), a totalitarian government. From the time of independence since 30 May 1991, the country has been continuing with a transitional government elected during the elections in April 1993. The scheduled elections in 2001 has been postponed indefinitely. The regional and local elections are conducted on a periodic basis on a restricted framework. All men and women of any ethnic or religious background are eligible to vote. No parties or groups other than PFDJ are allowed to contest and the elections are presided by representatives from PFDJ. Policy decisions should be centered around the party mandate and opposition and dissenters have been imprisoned.

==Geography==

The topography of the regions on the Western side, namely, Anseba, Central and has highland plateau, which are cooler than the regions around the coastal plains. There are two rainy seasons, the heavier one during summer and the lighter one during spring. The climate and geography of the region along with other regions of Eritrea is similar to the one of Ethiopia. The average elevation in the region is around to . The hottest month is May recording temperatures up to , while the coldest month is December to February when it reaches freezing temperature. The region received around of rainfall and the soil is conducive for agriculture.

There are a number of flora and fauna species in the high plateau regions in the West. Notably this was historic habitat for the endangered painted hunting dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;), a canid which is now thought to be extirpated from the region. Eritrea as a whole was extensively forested as recently as 1900. However, at present the total forest cover of Eritrea is less than one percent. Wildlife such as hamadryas baboons, Soemmerring&#x27;s gazelle, dorcas gazelle, warthog, black-backed jackal, Ruppells sandfox, dikdik, African golden wolf, hyena, Abyssinian hare, wild ass and ostriches are found in this region. African wild dog was also found in the coastal region, but their present condition is unknown. There have been reports of cheetah occurring in this region, but there has been no evidence of their presence. It is extremely likely that both cheetah and wild dog are extinct in Eritrea.

<text>Paul Finley Zaloom (born December 14, 1951) is an American actor and puppeteer, best known for his role as the character Beakman on the television show &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Garden City, Paul Zaloom was educated at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, and began his entertainment career at Goddard College with artists in residence the Bread and Puppet Theater, a troupe specializing in self-invented, home-made theatre. One of their performance locales was Coney Island, where Zaloom is said to have given advice to the &quot;unofficial Mayor of Coney Island&quot;, Dick Zigun, on how to bring in the crowds. In his solo work he utilizes found-object animation, in which he takes objects as varied as coffee pots and humidifiers and turns them into elements of political satire. His personal politics are liberal; he has referred to Elizabeth Dole and Margaret Thatcher as &quot;right-wing nutjobs&quot;. He has also been a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy since the early 1980s, having helped to lead a disarmament march during the Cold War.
In 1989, Zaloom appeared in &quot;The Unnaturals&quot;, a sketch comedy series featuring Tim Blake Nelson, John Mariano and Siobhan Fallon Hogan. In 1992 Zaloom starred in the cable TV children&#x27;s science program &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot;. The show moved to CBS in 1993 and aired for four seasons. Zaloom has also written, designed and performed eleven full-length one-man shows, including &quot;Fruit of Zaloom&quot;, &quot;Sick but True&quot;, &quot;Mighty Nice&quot; and &quot;The Mother of All Enemies&quot;, the latter being a shadow-puppet show featuring traditional Mid-west Asian comic puppet character Karagöz. His latest effort tackles social issues such as privacy, the war on terrorism, and discrimination based on sexual orientation and ethnicity. Aside from shadow-puppetry, Zaloom&#x27;s idiosyncratic work utilizes techniques such as overhead projection, government document expose, cantastoria picture performance, toy theater, as well as hand, rod, found object and dummy puppets.

Paul Zaloom has produced two films; the first is a mockumentary titled &quot;In Smog and Thunder: The Great War of the Californias&quot;, recounting a fictitious war between Los Angeles and San Francisco, released in 2003. The second film, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;, is a retelling of the poet Dante&#x27;s journey through hell, set in Los Angeles and performed in a style of puppetry called toy theater that uses paper cut-outs for puppets and sets. Zaloom co-wrote the script and was head puppeteer, and performed multiple voices for the film. Both films feature the artwork of Sandow Birk.

Zaloom has performed his work across the U.S. at many types of venues, including the Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center, the Walker Arts Center, Spoleto Festival U.S.A., UCLA Performing Arts Series, the American Repertory Theater, L.A.&#x27;s Museum of Contemporary Art, King Tut&#x27;s Wah-Wah Hut, and hundreds of others. He&#x27;s also played the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Les Semaines de la Marionnette in Paris, the UNIMA World Congress in Dresden, Vienna Festival and many others on nine international tours. Zaloom has received a &quot;Village Voice&quot; Obie Award, an American Theater Wing Design Award, New York Dance and Performance Award (the &quot;Bessie&quot;), LA Weekly Theater Award, and four Citations of Excellence in the Art of Puppetry from UNIMA-USA. He&#x27;s also been granted a Guggenheim Fellowship, four Jim Henson Foundation grants, a C.O.L.A. Fellowship, and four National Endowment for the Arts grants.

He has taught puppetry and cantastoria at colleges and universities in the U.S. and Europe, including CalArts, Rhode Island School of Design, Emerson College, the Omega Institute, George Mason University, the University of Michigan, and the Institut International de la Marionnette, Charleville-Mézières, France, amongst others. He continues to perform as Beakman in &quot;Beakman Live!&quot; stage shows, and is involved in any number of artistic projects as an advisor and mentor. He also attended a furry convention called Megaplex as a guest of honor in Orlando, FL in 2010.

In 2016, Zaloom made a guest appearance as Beakman in one of Captain Disillusion&#x27;s videos, debunking &quot;free energy&quot; devices.

==Personal life==
Zaloom is openly gay and has a daughter, Amanda Yvette Finley Israel Zaloom, with his former wife Jayne Israel.

He describes his ethnicity as &quot;half Syrian and half W.A.S.P.&quot;

<text>The Menominee River is a river in northwestern Michigan and northeastern Wisconsin in the United States. It is approximately long, draining a rural forested area of northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan into Lake Michigan. Its entire course, with that of its tributary, the Brule River, forms part of the boundary between the two states.

==Description==
It is formed approximately northwest of Iron Mountain, Michigan, by the confluence of the Brule and Michigamme rivers. As the Menominee flows southeast it picks up the Pine River and travels past Kingsford, Michigan and Niagara, Wisconsin. It then flows generally south, making broad meanders collecting the Sturgeon, Pemebonwon and Pike rivers. It enters Green Bay on Lake Michigan from the north between Marinette, Wisconsin and Menominee, Michigan.

Along its course the Menominee River has been converted into a series of large reservoirs. The waters contained in these reservoirs are some of the area&#x27;s deepest and cleanest lakes. Many of the lands around those waters are managed for recreational use, which ensures conservation and restricts shoreline development of rows of cottages and docks. The lakes are pristine, with wild shores of forest lands.

The name of the river comes from an Ojibwe Algonquian term meaning &quot;wild rice&quot;, or &quot;in the place of wild rice&quot;. They used the same name for the river as for the historic Menominee tribe who lived in the area and used the plant as a staple. The Menominee are the only Native American tribe living in Wisconsin today whose origin was in the present-day state. The federally recognized Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin have a reservation on the Wolf River (Fox River tributary). The Menominee believe that they were created at the mouth of the Menominee River when the Ancestral Bear emerged from the river mouth and was transformed into the first Menominee by the Creator.

The Chippewa lived in the upper portion of the river basin and referred to the river as &quot;Me-ne-cane Sepe&quot; or &quot;Many Little Islands River&quot;. In the &quot;Jesuit Relations,&quot; the French missionary priests referred to the river as &quot;Rivière de la Folle Avoine&quot; or &quot;Wild Oats River&quot;, again a reference to the wild rice.

The region through which the river flows was formerly a center of iron ore mining. Menominee River sediments are contaminated with arsenic at Marinette, Wisconsin, from industry. The Back Forty Mine is a proposed gold and zinc open-pit near Stephenson, Michigan to be constructed within of the river.

<text>Click It or Ticket is a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration campaign aimed at increasing the use of seat belts among young people in the United States. The campaign relies heavily on targeted advertising aimed at teens and young adults.

The Click It or Ticket campaign has existed at state level for many years. In 1993, Governor Jim Hunt launched the campaign in North Carolina in conjunction with a &quot;primary enforcement safety belt law&quot;, which allows law enforcement officers to issue a safety belt citation, without observing another offense. Since then, other states have adopted the campaign. In May 2002, the ten states with the most comprehensive campaigns saw an increase of 8.6 percentage points, from 68.5% to 77.1%, in safety belt usage over a four-week period (Solomon, Ulmer, &amp; Preusser, 2002).

==History==

Before 1980, usage of seat belts in the United States lingered around 11% despite volunteer and educational campaigns at local, county, and state levels. Between 1980 and 1984, individual organizations, public education programs, incentives and policy changes strove to increase the use of seat belts. However, these efforts failed to significantly affect usage in large, metropolitan areas, and by the end of the effort national seat belt usage had reached only 15%.

In 1984, New York became the first state to enact a mandatory seat belt use law, and by 1990, 37 other states had followed suit. The vast majority of these laws were &quot;secondary safety belt laws&quot;, meaning that an officer had to observe another traffic violation before issuing a citation for a seat belt infraction. Despite this, the national usage rate climbed from 15% to 50%.

==Campaign methods==
Seat belts have been proven to be one of the most effective safety devices in vehicles. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), seat belts saved an estimated 14,955 lives in 2017 alone. Despite these numbers, some individuals still fail to buckle up, putting their lives and the lives of others at risk. Educating the public about the importance of seat belt safety is crucial. By wearing a seat belt, individuals significantly reduce the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a crash. It&#x27;s not just about obeying the law; it&#x27;s about taking responsibility for one&#x27;s safety and the safety of others.

The Click it or Ticket campaign is a nationwide initiative aimed at increasing seat belt usage through a combination of education and enforcement. It was launched in 1993 by the NHTSA and has since become a highly recognized and effective campaign. The campaign&#x27;s main goal is to remind drivers and passengers that seat belt laws are strictly enforced, and failure to comply can result in fines and penalties. Law enforcement agencies play a crucial role in this campaign by conducting seat belt enforcement blitzes and increasing visibility on the roads.

The national television ad [airing] on several major networks features people driving in several regions of the country without their safety belts on. They receive a ticket, and then buckle up. The ads [appear] primarily in programs that deliver large audiences of teens and young adults—especially men. The programs include Fear Factor, WWE Smackdown, Major League Baseball, NBA Conference Finals, NASCAR Live, and the Indy 500.

The campaign is also stressing strict enforcement of safety belt laws, in particular, the &quot;Primary safety belt laws&quot;, which allow law enforcement officers issue a safety belt citation without observing another offense. New Hampshire, the state with historically the lowest safety belt usage, is the only state without an adult safety belt law. Massachusetts, the state with the second lowest usage, has only a secondary safety belt law, which requires officers to observe another driving offense before issuing a safety belt citation. Enforcement of safety belt laws of both types is to be made possible by checkpoints and saturation patrols that will detect violations of safety belt and child passenger safety laws.

==Success==

Figures released by the U.S. Department of Transportation, after amplifying the advertising and enforcement campaign on May 19, 2003, indicated that &quot;National belt use among young men and women ages 16-24 moved from 65% to 72%, and 73% to 80% respectively, while belt use in the overall population increased from 75% to 79%.&quot;

==Opposition==

Opposition to the effort is primarily based on the belief that requiring wearing of a seatbelt is a violation of civil rights. For example, Prof. Walter E. Williams of George Mason University writes, &quot;The point is whether government has a right to coerce us into taking care of ourselves. If eating what we wish is our business and not that of government, then why should we accept government&#x27;s coercing us to wear seat belts?&quot; Journalist Scott Indrisek has strenuously worked to oppose mandatory seat belt efforts, which he calls &quot;a black stain on America.&quot;
Additional objections settle specifically around the assertion that a seatbelt is a medical device, and because one is entitled to make their own medical decisions they should also be permitted to make their own decisions about wearing a seatbelt.

In Maryland, former Governor Robert Ehrlich opposed spotlights used by police officers to see into vehicles at night to determine if seat belts were being used on the basis that this violated privacy. Nighttime enforcement was suspended at the governor&#x27;s request. Nighttime enforcement was resumed by Ehrlich&#x27;s successor, Martin O&#x27;Malley, hours after O&#x27;Malley took office in January 2007.

During the COVID-19 pandemic after seeing facemask orders/mandates have been being compared to seat belt laws, many states in 2021 have tried to repeal their seat belt laws.

<text>The provinces of Rwanda (Kinyarwanda: &quot;intara&quot;) are divided into districts (&quot;akarere&quot;) and municipalities (&quot;umujyi&quot;). Prior to January 1, 2006, Rwanda was composed of 12 provinces. The Rwandan government decided to establish new provinces in an attempt to address issues that arose from the genocide against the Tutsis. The new provinces were to be &quot;ethnically-diverse administrative areas&quot;. 

Until 2002, the provinces were called prefectures (&quot;perefegitura&quot;).

==Provinces==
As of January 1, 2006 the five provinces of Rwanda are:
==Provincial districts and sectors ==

===Eastern Province ===
===Northern Province===
===Western Province===
===Southern Province===

<text>Olivet Nazarene University (ONU) is a private Nazarene university in Bourbonnais, Illinois. Named for its founding location, Olivet, Illinois, ONU was originally established as a grammar school in east-central Illinois in 1907. In the late 1930s, it moved to the campus in Bourbonnais. The university is affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene and is the annual site of the church&#x27;s &quot;Regional Celebrate Life&quot; youth gathering for the Central USA Region.

==History==
Olivet Nazarene University traces its roots to 1907, when the Eastern Illinois Holiness Association started Miss Mary Nesbitt&#x27;s Grammar School in a house in Georgetown, Illinois. In 1908, the school&#x27;s founders acquired 14 acres in the village of Olivet, and moved the grammar school to the proposed campus. A Wesleyan–holiness community sprang up around the school.

In 1909, the liberal arts college was chartered and named Illinois Holiness University, with A. M. Hills from Texas Holiness University as its first president. It was then given to the Church of the Nazarene in 1912, with E. F. Walker as president, and inherited one of the most populated Nazarene regions in the United States. It was renamed Olivet University in 1915, and again in 1921 to Olivet College.

The economic solvency of the school became a problem in the 1920s, and the trustees were forced to declare bankruptcy in 1926. The school&#x27;s treasurer, T. W. Willingham, purchased the school back at an auction and was elected president. In 1939, the main building on campus was destroyed by fire. This prompted the school to look for a new location. Under President A.L. Parrott, the school moved in 1940, onto the previous campus of St. Viator&#x27;s College. With the move, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Olivet Nazarene College (ONC). The school&#x27;s name was changed again in 1986 to Olivet Nazarene University (ONU).

The past 20 years have seen a significant change in the culture and image of Olivet. Following the appointment of John C. Bowling as University president, the university began appealing to a more diverse set of students from different Christian denominations. The school began several different construction projects to mark the growth of the school as a whole. The university currently is organized with seven academic units: the College of Arts and Sciences, the McGraw School of Business, the Martin D. Walker School of Engineering, the School of Education, the School of Life and Health Sciences, the School of Theology and Christian Ministry, and the School of Graduate and Continuing Studies.

==Campus==
ONU&#x27;s campus is in the village of Bourbonnais, Illinois, outside the city of Kankakee, Illinois, with 30 buildings. Four buildings are original from St. Viator College, including Burke Administration, Chapman Hall, Miller Business Center, and Birchard Gymnasium. There are also satellite campuses for adult education in Rolling Meadows, Illinois and Hong Kong.

===Campus features===

Since Olivet Nazarene University relocated to Bourbonnais, the campus has undergone several different waves of construction. In addition, within the past two years, there have been numerous construction projects including the construction of the Betty and Kenneth Hawkins Centennial Chapel, the largest theater in Kankakee County, which seats approximately 3,059 people, and the Student Life and Recreation Center, which opened in December 2012.

In total, there are seven academic buildings (Burke, Wisner, Weber, Reed, Larsen, Forton Villa, and Leslie Parrott), two gymnasiums (Birchard and McHie), and six residence halls (Chapman, Hills, Nesbitt, Parrott, McClain, Howe and Williams). The university also has several off-campus apartment buildings (Old Oak, Oak Run, University Place, Grand, Stadium, Stratford, and Bresee). Centennial Chapel has showcased many Christian artists including Bill Gaither and Chris Tomlin.

The university has also completed their student life and recreation center which was opened on December 12, 2012. This building serves as central hub for the campus and features an Olympic-sized pool, Jacuzzi, lazy river, resistance pool, indoor track, one of the tallest collegiate rock climbing walls in North America, various classrooms, offices, a fitness center, game room and coffee shop.

==Organization==
ONU is one of nine regional U.S. liberal arts colleges affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene. ONU is the college for the &quot;Central USA Region&quot; of the United States. In terms of the Church of the Nazarene, the &quot;Central Region&quot; comprises the Wisconsin, Northwestern Illinois, Illinois, Chicago Central, Northern Michigan, Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Northwest Indiana, Northeastern Indiana, Indianapolis, and Southwest Indiana districts, which include Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. Each college receives financial backing from the Nazarene churches on its region; part of each church budget is paid into a fund for its regional school. Each college or university is also bound by a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement not to actively recruit outside its respective &quot;educational region.&quot;

==Academics==
ONU has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1956 and offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 67 academic majors. The School of Graduate and Continuing Studies offers master&#x27;s degrees, nontraditional adult degree-completion programs, and a doctor of education degree offered only at Bourbonnais main campus as well as a master of &quot;professional counseling&quot; degree offered at a site in Hong Kong and distance education for a master in education degree. The doctor of education degree was offered through a unique hybrid/cohort model (both in-class and online). Starting late 2018, the doctor of education program was switched to full online only version. The 2007 acceptance rate for students who applied to the college was 70.3 percent.

==Student life==
There were 4,636 students at the college in 2007, 3,190 of whom were undergraduates. ONU students are from 40 states and 20 countries, and represent 30 Christian denominations. 
The university offers over 80 different clubs with many different focuses. All of the clubs and student organizations are sponsored by the Olivet Nazarene University Associated Student Council. Some of the most influential clubs on campus include Capitol Hill Gang, the university&#x27;s political society, and the campus chapter of the International Justice Mission.

The school also supports one club sports team which is loosely affiliated with the university. In 2010, the Black Penguins, a club Ultimate Frisbee team was created and reached the UPA&#x27;s College Nationals, reaching that level again in 2014.

==Athletics==
The Olivet Nazarene athletic teams are called the Tigers. The university is member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) since the 1996–97 academic year. They are also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the North Central Region of the Division I level. The Tigers previously competed in the Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference (NIIC) of the NCAA Division III ranks from 1974–75 to 1995–96; while also becoming a founding member of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA) in the 1994 fall season (football-only).

Olivet Nazarene competes in 21 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading and marching bands. Club sports include ice hockey.

===Overview===
The purple and gold colors and the &quot;Tigers&quot; athletic nickname at Olivet Nazarene have existed since 1940, when ONC students first played Bethany Nazarene College (BNC; now Southern Nazarene University), and intervarsity athletics began with another game between ONC and BNC in 1966.

===Training camp===
From 2002 to 2019, the Chicago Bears held their summer training camp at the school. Although the Bears had an agreement to continue practicing at the university through 2022, they moved the camp to Halas Hall for the 2020 season.

==Controversies==
===Evolution controversy===
In 2007, President John C. Bowling prohibited ONU alumnus and faculty member Richard G. Colling from teaching the general education biology course which he had taught since 1991. President Bowling banned professors from assigning Colling&#x27;s 2004 book: &quot;Random Designer: Created from Chaos to Connect with the Creator&quot; (Browning Press: ) In the book, Colling argued that &quot;&#x27;evolution has stood the test of time and considerable scrutiny,&#x27; and that evolution through random mutation and natural selection is &#x27;fully compatible with&#x27; faith. In particular, his designing God uses the laws of nature he created &#x27;to accomplish his goals&#x27; of, among other things, a wondrous diversity of nature and an ever-changing living world.&quot;

The 2009-2013 Manual of the Church of the Nazarene states: &quot;The Church of the Nazarene believes in the biblical account of creation (&quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . .&quot;—Genesis 1:1). We oppose any godless interpretation of the origin of the universe and of humankind.&quot; The 2005-2009 Manual included an additional paragraph that was removed in 2009: &quot;[T]he church accepts as valid all scientifically verifiable discoveries in geology and other natural phenomena, for we firmly believe that God is the Creator.&quot; In a chapel message delivered 11 January 2006, President Bowling stated: &quot;The Christian faith and some understandings of evolution are not necessarily incompatible. However, I want to be very clear in saying that not every articulation of evolution will do; not at all. That is to say, evolution must be understood in certain ways to be compatible with Christian faith.&quot; In October 2007 the School of Theology and Christian Ministry and the Department of Biology issued a statement concerning creation and theistic evolution, which includes this statement: &quot;We affirm the value of science as a way of exploring the revelation of the Creator God in nature. We think that the theory of evolution can be seen as a scientific explanation of the diversity of life on earth, rather than as a godless religion that denies God&#x27;s hand in the processes of creation.&quot;

In a September 15, 2007 article about the Colling controversy published in Newsweek, Bowling is quoted as saying: &quot;In the last few months [objections to Colling] took on a new life and became a distraction, and things were deteriorating in terms of confidence in the university.&quot; Bowling further said that he banned Colling&#x27;s book in order to &quot;get the bull&#x27;s-eye off Colling and let the storm die down.&quot; In 2009, the conclusion of an American Association of University Professors (AAUP) investigation found problems with shared governance at ONU and that Colling&#x27;s rights had been violated when Bowling placed the concerns of the more conservative members of its Nazarene constituency higher than its principles of academic freedom. In 2009, Dr. Colling resigned from the Olivet Nazarene University faculty in an agreement with the school.

===Homosexuality===
According to the 2009–2013 Manual of the Church of the Nazarene: &quot;Homosexuality is one means by which human sexuality is perverted. We recognize the depth of the perversion that leads to homosexual acts but affirm the biblical position that such acts are sinful and subject to the wrath of God. We believe the grace of God sufficient to overcome the practice of homosexuality (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). We deplore any action or statement that would seem to imply compatibility between Christian morality and the practice of homosexuality. We urge clear preaching and teaching concerning Bible standards of sexual morality.&quot;

Woody Webb, VP for Student Development, stated: &quot;We want to talk about this issue with students, and we want them to feel safe doing so. If they come to us and want help understanding their same sex attractions, our offices are open. While we won&#x27;t help a student accept [his or her] same sex attraction and enter a gay lifestyle, if they realize that their same sex attraction is contrary to God&#x27;s will for them, we will walk with them on their journey.&quot; According to a controversial article published in the Olivet student newspaper, &quot;[I]f a student needs counseling and indicates that he or she is gay on the application... Olivet counselors are not permitted to counsel them according to University policy.&quot; If a student is attempting to overcome homosexual tendencies, the University will accept them into counseling services. The only way that ONU will not accept a student into the counseling program is if the purpose of the counseling is directly related to accepting their homosexuality. In addition, if this is the case, Olivet will refer the student to an outside counseling agency.

In March 2012, the Illinois Defense of Marriage Initiative visited campus, and advocated against gay marriage. That same month, Mike Haley, a motivational speaker and self-proclaimed reformed homosexual, spoke to students during the school&#x27;s mandatory Chapel. According to &quot;The Daily Journal&quot; &quot;[t]his prompted a small group of students at Olivet to petition for tolerance and an open discussion about homosexuality.&quot;

===T. J. Martinson===

On June 28, 2019, the university rescinded its job offer of assistant professor to academic and author T. J. Martinson (Ph.D. IU Bloomington, &quot;The Reign of the Kingfisher&quot;), a third-generation Olivet alumnus, &quot;citing complaints that his novel contained profanity and other elements [including the depiction of prostitution and the portrayal of a lesbian character] that conflict with the school&#x27;s religious doctrine&quot;.
On July 26, 2019, PEN America released a statement on the controversy: &quot;A professor&#x27;s dismissal on the basis of a work of fiction suggests a disturbing climate for open inquiry and creative expression at [Olivet Nazarene University]. Unfortunately, the circumstances of Martinson&#x27;s dismissal give the impression that the institution is more committed to quelling potential criticism and controversy than it is committed to defending the academic freedom of its faculty. In this case, dismissing Martinson over the content of his novel, including the presence of a lesbian character, sends a message of exclusion to the ONU community and is likely to have a chilling effect on the free and creative expression of students and faculty.&quot;

<text>&#x27; (&quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), originally called &#x27; (&quot;On the Deeds of the Britons&quot;), is a fictitious historical account of British history, written around 1136 by Geoffrey of Monmouth. It chronicles the lives of the kings of the Britons over the course of two thousand years, beginning with the Trojans founding the British nation and continuing until the Anglo-Saxons assumed control of much of Britain around the 7th century. It is one of the central pieces of the Matter of Britain.

Although taken as historical well into the 16th century, it is now considered to have no value as history. When events described, such as Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasions of Britain, can be corroborated from contemporary histories, Geoffrey&#x27;s account can be seen to be wildly inaccurate. It remains, however, a valuable piece of medieval literature, which contains the earliest known version of the story of King Lear and his three daughters, and helped popularise the legend of King Arthur.

==Contents==
===Dedication===
Geoffrey starts the book with a statement of his purpose in writing the history: &quot;I have not been able to discover anything at all on the kings who lived here before the Incarnation of Christ, or indeed about Arthur and all the others who followed on after the Incarnation. Yet the deeds of these men were such that they deserve to be praised for all time.&quot; He claims that he was given a source for this period by Archdeacon Walter of Oxford, who presented him with a &quot;certain very ancient book written in the British language&quot; from which he has translated his history. He also cites Gildas and Bede as sources. Then follows a dedication to Robert, Earl of Gloucester and Waleran, Count of Meulan, whom he enjoins to use their knowledge and wisdom to improve his tale.

===Outlook===
The work of the which was complied by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century has since been cited by medieval English and Welsh kings to assert the legitimacy of their rule. The legend begins 3,000 years ago after the Trojan War (). It states Brutus of Troy&#x27;s family fled Troy for Anatolia, then Italy, and finally to the British Isles, specifically Totnes in England, where the Brutus Stone is found today. Then, Brutus divided the island of Great Britain between his three sons as leaders of their respective countries. Locrinus was his eldest and was given England to rule, Albanactus was given Scotland, and Camber, the third son, became the ruler of Wales. All three making up the countries of Britain (). The books then follow the timeline of the Kings of Britain for the following millennium, until the Roman invasion of Britain and the subsequent founding of medieval kingdoms in Britain.

==Books==
===Book One===
The &quot;Historia&quot; itself begins with the Trojan Aeneas, who, according to the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil, settled in Italy after the Trojan War. His great-grandson Brutus is banished, and, after a period of wandering, is directed by the goddess Diana to settle on an island in the western ocean. Brutus lands at Totnes and names the island, then called Albion, &quot;Britain&quot; after himself. Brutus defeats the giants who are the only inhabitants of the island, and establishes his capital, Troia Nova (&quot;New Troy&quot;), on the banks of the Thames; later it is known as Trinovantum, and eventually renamed London.

===Book Two===
When Brutus dies, his three sons, Locrinus, Kamber and Albanactus, divide the country between themselves; the three kingdoms are named Loegria, Kambria (North and West of the Severn to Humber) and Albany (Scotland). The story then progresses rapidly through the reigns of the descendants of Locrinus, including Bladud, who uses magic and even tries to fly, but dies in the process.

Bladud&#x27;s son Leir reigns for sixty years. He has no sons, so upon reaching old age he decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. To decide who should get the largest share, he asks his daughters how much they love him. Goneril and Regan give extravagant answers, but Cordelia answers simply and sincerely; angered, he gives Cordelia no land. Goneril and Regan are to share half the island with their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall. Cordelia marries Aganippus, King of the Franks, and departs for Gaul. Soon Goneril and Regan and their husbands rebel and take the whole kingdom. After Leir has had all his attendants taken from him, he begins to regret his actions towards Cordelia and travels to Gaul. Cordelia receives him compassionately and restores his royal robes and retinue. Aganippus raises a Gaulish army for Leir, who returns to Britain, defeats his sons-in-law and regains the kingdom. Leir rules for three years and then dies; Cordelia inherits the throne and rules for five years before Marganus and Cunedagius, her sisters&#x27; sons, rebel against her. They imprison Cordelia; grief-stricken, she kills herself. Marganus and Cunedagius divide the kingdom between themselves, but soon quarrel and go to war with each other. Cunedagius eventually kills Marganus in Wales and retains the whole kingdom, ruling for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son Rivallo.

A later descendant of Cunedagius, King Gorboduc, has two sons called Ferreux and Porrex. They quarrel and both are eventually killed, sparking a civil war. This leads to Britain being ruled by five kings, who keep attacking each other. Dunvallo Molmutius, the son of Cloten, the King of Cornwall, becomes pre-eminent. He eventually defeats the other kings and establishes his rule over the whole island. He is said to have &quot;established the so-called Molmutine Laws which are still famous today among the English&quot;.

===Book Three===
Dunvallo&#x27;s sons, Belinus and Brennius, fight a civil war before being reconciled by their mother, and proceed to sack Rome. Victorious, Brennius remains in Italy, while Belinus returns to rule Britain.

Numerous brief accounts of successive kings follow. These include Lud, who renames Trinovantum &quot;Kaerlud&quot; after himself; this later becomes corrupted to London. Lud is succeeded by his brother, Cassibelanus, as Lud&#x27;s sons Androgeus and Tenvantius are not yet of age. In recompense, Androgeus is made Duke of Kent and Trinovantum (London), and Tenvantius is made Duke of Cornwall.

===Book Four===
After his conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar looks over the sea and resolves to order Britain to swear obedience and pay tribute to Rome. His commands are answered by a letter of refusal from Cassivellaunus. Caesar sails a fleet to Britain, but he is overwhelmed by Cassivellaunus&#x27;s army and forced to retreat to Gaul. Two years later he makes another attempt, but is again pushed back. Then Cassivellaunus quarrels with one of his dukes, Androgeus, who sends a letter to Caesar asking him to help avenge the duke&#x27;s honour. Caesar invades once more and besieges Cassivellaunus on a hill. After several days Cassivellaunus offers to make peace with Caesar, and Androgeus, filled with remorse, goes to Caesar to plead with him for mercy. Cassivellaunus pays tribute and makes peace with Caesar, who then returns to Gaul.

Cassivelaunus dies and is succeeded by his nephew Tenvantius, as Androgeus has gone to Rome. Tenvantius is succeeded in turn by his son Kymbelinus, and then Kymbelinus&#x27;s son Guiderius. Guiderius refuses to pay tribute to emperor Claudius, who then invades Britain. After Guiderius is killed in battle with the Romans, his brother Arvirargus continues the defence, but eventually agrees to submit to Rome, and is given the hand of Claudius&#x27;s daughter Genvissa in marriage. Claudius returns to Rome, leaving the province under Arvirargus&#x27;s governorship.

===Book Five===
The line of British kings continues under Roman rule, and includes Lucius, Britain&#x27;s first Christian king, and several Roman figures, including the emperor Constantine I, the usurper Allectus and the military commander Asclepiodotus. When Octavius passes the crown to his son-in-law Maximianus, his nephew Conan Meriadoc is given rule of Brittany to compensate him for not succeeding. After a long period of Roman rule, the Romans decide they no longer wish to defend the island and depart. The Britons are immediately besieged by attacks from Picts, Scots and Danes, especially as their numbers have been depleted due to Conan colonizing Brittany and Maximianus using British troops for his campaigns. In desperation the Britons send letters to the general of the Roman forces, asking for help, but receive no reply (this passage borrows heavily from the corresponding section in Gildas&#x27; &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;).

===Book Six===
After the Romans leave, the Britons ask the King of Brittany (Armorica), Aldroenus, descended from Conan, to rule them. However, Aldroenus instead sends his brother Constantine to rule the Britons. After Constantine&#x27;s death, Vortigern assists his eldest son Constans in succeeding, before enabling their murder and coming to power. Constantine&#x27;s remaining sons Aurelius Ambrosius and Uther are too young to rule and are taken to safety in Armorica. Vortigern invites the Saxons under Hengist and Horsa to fight for him as mercenaries, but they rise against him. He loses control of much of his land and encounters Merlin.

===Book Seven: The Prophecies of Merlin===

At this point Geoffrey abruptly pauses his narrative by inserting a series of prophecies attributed to Merlin. Some of the prophecies act as an epitome of upcoming chapters of the &quot;Historia&quot;, while others are veiled allusions to historical people and events of the Norman world in the 11th–12th centuries. The remainder are obscure.

===Book Eight===
After Aurelius Ambrosius defeats and kills Vortigern, becoming king, Britain remains in a state of war under him and his brother Uther. They are both assisted by the wizard Merlin. At one point during the continuous string of battles, Ambrosius takes ill and Uther must lead the army for him. This allows an enemy assassin to pose as a physician and poison Ambrosius. When the king dies, a comet taking the form of a dragon&#x27;s head (pendragon) appears in the night sky, which Merlin interprets as a sign that Ambrosius is dead and that Uther will be victorious and succeed him. So after defeating his latest enemies, Uther adds &quot;Pendragon&quot; to his name and is crowned king.

But another enemy strikes, forcing Uther to make war again. This time he is temporarily defeated, gaining final victory only with the help of Duke Gorlois of Cornwall. But while celebrating this victory with Gorlois, he falls in love with the duke&#x27;s wife, Igerna. This leads to war between Uther Pendragon and Gorlois of Cornwall, during which Uther clandestinely lies with Igerna through the magic of Merlin. Arthur is conceived that night. Then Gorlois is killed and Uther marries Igerna. But he must war against the Saxons again. Although Uther ultimately triumphs, he dies after drinking water from a spring the Saxons had poisoned.

===Books Nine and Ten===
Uther&#x27;s son Arthur assumes the throne and inflicts a severe enough defeat against the Saxons that they cease to be a threat until after his death. In the meantime, Arthur conquers most of northern Europe and ushers in a period of peace and prosperity that lasts until the Romans, led by Lucius Hiberius, demands that Britain once again pay tribute to Rome. Arthur defeats Lucius in Gaul, intending to become Emperor, but in his absence, his nephew Mordred seduces and marries Guinevere and seizes the throne.

===Books Eleven and Twelve===
Arthur returns and kills Mordred at the Battle of Camlann, but, mortally wounded, he is carried off to the isle of Avalon, and hands the kingdom to his cousin Constantine, son of Cador and Duke of Cornwall.

The Saxons returned after Arthur&#x27;s death, but would not end the line of British kings until the death of Cadwallader. Cadwallader is forced to flee Britain and requests the aid of King Alan of the Armoricans. However an angel&#x27;s voice tells him the Britons will no longer rule and he should go to Rome. Cadwallader does so, dying there, though leaves his son and nephew to rule the remaining Britons. The remaining Britons are driven into Wales and the Saxon Athelstan becomes King of Loegria.

==Sources==
Geoffrey claimed to have translated the &quot;Historia&quot; into Latin from &quot;a very ancient book in the British tongue&quot;, given to him by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford. However, no modern scholars take this claim seriously. Much of the work appears to be derived from Gildas&#x27;s 6th-century &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;, Bede&#x27;s 8th-century &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;, the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; ascribed to Nennius, the 10th-century &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, medieval Welsh genealogies (such as the Harleian Genealogies) and king-lists, the poems of Taliesin, the Welsh tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, and some of the medieval Welsh saints&#x27; lives, expanded and turned into a continuous narrative by Geoffrey&#x27;s own imagination.

==Medieval influence==
The medieval works are deemed to be drawn from traditional Celtic materials and are supposed to have deep roots to the point that the publications are considered reliable and not the imagination of one man, aka Geoffrey. However, since Geoffrey&#x27;s publication of the Historia Regum Britanniae (De gestis Britonum), his work has been downgraded due to factual errors that were once recorded for the publication of his work i.e. observations to do with Stonehenge. Then, it was merely a century later that Geoffrey&#x27;s was rewritten and translated in Cistercian monasteries at locations such as Whitland, St Davids Cathedral and later the Strata Florida Abbey in Wales, and then translated by Hywel Fychan ap Hywel Goch of Buellt into Latin-Welsh during 1250 in the manuscript &quot;Chronicle of Kings&quot; (). Both of which are part of the medieval manuscripts of Wales (Wales Library collection), a lot of which are kept at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth today. Geoffrey&#x27;s work was to do with the history of the British kings who hailed from the Greek Empire and specifically from after the Trojan War (fall of Troy). Then, the books detail the Welsh medieval era during the Kingdom of Gwynedd, from around 682, culminating in the life of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd until 1282, it was Prince Llywelyn II who referenced Geoffrey&#x27;s work. Also, another king to cite the books was Prince Owain Glyndwr, he spoke of the Galfridian works Geoffrey to Robert III of Scotland. Glyndwr referenced himself as the Prince of Wales and a direct descendant and heir of the son of Brutus of Troy, King Camber, and also of later the medieval King Cadwaladr. The work of Geoffrey of Monmouth was considered to take inspiration from the Latin publication of the life of 11th and 12th century King Gruffudd ap Cynan (written from 1137), finished by Gerald of Wales. Gruffudd&#x27;s biography has a detailed list of the Kings of Wales with his ancestry going back to Brutus of Troy. However, Gruffudd&#x27;s descent was from Locrinus of Scotland and not his brother King Camber of Wales. Otherwise, it is said that in the 8th century, the Welsh monk Nennius wrote the now questioned ancestry list, and that it was Geoffrey who published the king list accepted to date.

In an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, Robert of Torigny gave Henry of Huntington a copy of &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works, by which means some of Geoffrey&#x27;s fictions became embedded in popular history. The history of Geoffrey forms the basis for much British lore and literature as well as being a rich source of material for Welsh bards. It became tremendously popular during the High Middle Ages, revolutionising views of British history before and during the Anglo-Saxon period despite the criticism of such writers as Gerald of Wales and William of Newburgh, who stated &quot;no one but a person ignorant of ancient history [can doubt] how impertinently and impudently he falsifies in every respect.&quot;
The prophecies of Merlin in particular were often drawn on in later periods, for instance by both sides in the issue of English influence over Scotland under Edward I and his successors.

The &quot;Historia&quot; was quickly translated into Norman verse by Wace (the &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;) in 1155. Wace&#x27;s version was in turn translated into Middle English verse by Layamon (the &quot;Brut&quot;) in the early 13th century. In the second quarter of the 13th century, a version in Latin verse, the &quot;Gesta Regum Britanniae&quot;, was produced by William of Rennes. Material from Geoffrey was incorporated into a large variety of Anglo-Norman and Middle English prose compilations of historical material from the 13th century onward.

Geoffrey was translated into a number of different Welsh prose versions by the end of the 13th century, collectively known as &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;. One variant of the &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, the so-called &quot;Brut Tysilio&quot;, was proposed in 1917 by the archaeologist William Flinders Petrie to be the ancient British book that Geoffrey translated, although the &quot;Brut&quot; itself claims to have been translated from Latin by Walter of Oxford, based on his own earlier translation from Welsh to Latin. Geoffrey&#x27;s work is greatly important because it brought the Welsh culture into British society and made it acceptable. It is also the first record we have of the great figure King Lear, and the beginning of the mythical King Arthur figure.

For centuries, the &quot;Historia&quot; was accepted at face value, and much of its material was incorporated into Holinshed&#x27;s 16th-century &quot;Chronicles&quot;. Modern historians have regarded the &quot;Historia&quot; as a work of fiction with some factual information contained within. John Morris in &quot;The Age of Arthur&quot; calls it a &quot;deliberate spoof&quot;, although this is based on misidentifying Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, as Walter Map, a satirical writer who lived a century later.

It continues to have an influence on popular culture. For example, Mary Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Merlin Trilogy&quot; and the TV miniseries &quot;Merlin&quot; both contain large elements taken from the &quot;Historia&quot;.

==Manuscript tradition and textual history==
Two hundred and fifteen medieval manuscripts of the &quot;Historia&quot; survive, dozens of them copied before the end of the 12th century. Even among the earliest manuscripts a large number of textual variants, such as the so-called &quot;First Variant&quot;, can be discerned. These are reflected in the three possible prefaces to the work and in the presence or absence of certain episodes and phrases. Certain variants may be due to &quot;authorial&quot; additions to different early copies, but most probably reflect early attempts to alter, add to or edit the text. The task of disentangling these variants and establishing Geoffrey&#x27;s original text is long and complex, and the extent of the difficulties surrounding the text has been established only recently.

The variant title was introduced in the Middle Ages, and this became the most common form in the modern period. A critical edition of the work published in 2007, however, demonstrated that the most accurate manuscripts refer to the work as , and that this was the title Geoffrey himself used to refer to the work.

<text>Spin bowling is a bowling technique in cricket, in which the ball is delivered relatively slowly but with rapid rotation, giving it the potential to deviate sharply after bouncing. A bowler who uses this technique is called a spinner, a spin bowler, or a slow bowler.

It is one of the two main approaches to bowling, the other being fast bowling.

A spinner may bowl with their right-arm or left-arm, and with a finger spin or wrist spin action. Therefore, there are four types of spin bowling: off spin, leg spin, left-arm orthodox spin and left-arm unorthodox spin.

The bowlers with the highest, second-highest and fourth-highest number of wickets in the history of Test cricket, Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne and Anil Kumble, respectively, were spinners.

==Purpose==
The main aim of spin bowling is to bowl the cricket ball with rapid rotation so that when it bounces on the pitch it will deviate from its normal straight path, thus making it difficult for the batsman to hit the ball cleanly. The speed the ball travels is not critical, and is significantly slower than that for fast bowling. A typical spin delivery has a speed in the range 70–90 km/h (45–55 mph).

==Techniques==

Spin bowling is divided into four categories, depending on the physical technique used. There is virtually no overlap between the two basic biomechanical techniques of wrist spin and finger spin.

Depending on technique, a spin bowler uses either predominant wrist or finger motion to impart spin to the ball around a horizontal axis that is at an oblique angle to the length of the pitch. This sort of spin means it is also possible for the Magnus effect to cause the ball to deviate sideways through the air, before it bounces. Such deviation is called &quot;drift&quot;. The combination of drift and spin can make the ball&#x27;s trajectory complex, with a change of direction at the bounce.

Spin bowlers are generally given the task of bowling with an old, worn cricket ball. A new cricket ball better suits the techniques of fast bowling than spin bowling, while a worn one grips the pitch better and achieves greater spin. Spin bowlers are also more effective later in a game, as the pitch dries up and begins to crack and crumble. This again provides more purchase for the spinning ball and produces greater deviation. Spin bowlers that open the bowling are rare, but became a more viable option with the introduction of Twenty20 cricket when pitch conditions are in their favour, and the ball also generally drifts more in the air. Spin bowlers can also be used tactically in shorter forms of the game, to &#x27;take the pace off the ball&#x27;. This strategy is especially effective to slow down the scoring rates of batsmen who specialise in making use of the pace of faster bowlers to score runs quickly. The lower inherent momentum of a spin bowler necessitates more power exerted by the batsman to achieve the same results.

==Equivalences==
Both finger spin and wrist spin bowlers use a range of different angles of spin to confuse the batsman and dismiss them. Many of these variations have direct equivalents in the other discipline, but the names used for the various deliveries may be different.

==Conditions==
Spin bowling has become a forte of bowlers from South Asia. The primary reason for this is that pitches in the sub-continent provide more help to spin bowlers. The faster the pitch degenerates, the earlier the spinners come into the picture. Australian and South African pitches are usually very hard and bouncy, helping the fast bowlers more. They do not break up very much during the match. In contrast, pitches in the sub-continent are not that hard. They are not usually held together by the grass as much; hence they break up more quickly and help spin bowlers. 

In addition to this, spin bowling is considered to be less tiring than pace bowling as it generally does not employ a lengthy run up. Therefore, spin bowling is more prevalent in the hot and humid conditions of the sub-continent as a form of energy conservation, especially in multi-day competitions. 

In general, leg-spin is considered to be one of the toughest types of bowling in which to keep control of the ball, but it is very effective in picking off wickets.

==Flight, turn, bounce, drift, dip==

It is customary among cricket commentators to describe and judge the quality of spin bowling in terms of the characteristics &quot;flight&quot;, &quot;turn&quot;, &quot;bounce&quot;, &quot;drift&quot;, and &quot;dip&quot;. All these are arts to deceive the batsman and require much practice. The basic trajectory of spin bowling is two-lines-at-an-angle, but the above characteristics (described below) modify this &#x27;normal&#x27; trajectory into more complex shapes.

Turn: How much the ball turns after pitching (e.g. 5 degree deviation after meeting the ground). It depends on the number and direction of revolutions of the ball. The movement and rotation of the ball varies, depending on the position of the wrist and the finger. An occasional unexpected straight ball can usefully be included in an attack, but spin variation is the main technique used to deceive the batsman and take wickets. A high rate of turn is above 33 rev/second, or 2000 rpm. Graeme Swann consistently spun over 2000 rpm, the most amongst English spinners until Liam Dawson topped 35 rev/second, or 2100 rpm. Also, the slower the ball, the more it tends to deviate. For an offspinner, you will have to bowl from wide of off-stump to get the ball to turn into the right-handed batsman and force them to nick off the edge to a fielder or into the top of off stump.

Bounce: Getting the ball to bounce more than normal, so that the ball meets the batsman at a greater height than expected. Sometimes, if the ball spins horizontally (e.g. a slider), the batsman will not be able to make contact with the ball and it may hit the stumps before the second bounce.

Drift: Getting the ball to move sideways while in air. Late drift causes the batsman to cover the wrong line and the ball may catch the edge of the bat.

Dip: Getting the ball to pitch (meet the ground) at a shorter distance than normal. Late dip causes the batsman to misjudge the length of the ball.

Flight: throwing the ball up a bit more than normal, so that its time in the air before pitching is longer. A slow ball with extra flight may deceive the batsman into thinking it is slower than it is and therefore mistiming his shot. This is very effective for offspinners. Usually a spin bowler relies on tricks during flight to produce turn, bounce, drift and dip, or combinations of them.

<text>Cynthia Voigt (born February 25, 1942) is an American writer of books for young adults dealing with various topics such as adventure, mystery, racism and child abuse. Her first book in the Tillerman family series, &quot;Homecoming&quot;, was nominated for several international prizes and adapted as a 1996 film. Her novel &quot;Dicey&#x27;s Song&quot; won the 1983 Newbery Medal.

Voigt received the Margaret Edwards Award from the American Library Association in 1995 recognizing her contribution in writing for teens.

== Life ==
Cynthia Voigt was born February 25, 1942, in Boston, Massachusetts. She graduated from Dana Hall School and Smith College in Massachusetts and worked in advertising in New York City. In 1964, she married and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she started teaching. She taught second grade (and one high school English class) at the Key School in Annapolis, Maryland, from 1966 to 1971. She divorced in 1972, and taught high school English in Glen Burnie, Maryland. She began writing again and remarried in 1974, to Walter Voigt, who taught classical Greek at the Key School, where she returned to teach high school English again. After winning the Newbery Medal for &quot;Dicey&#x27;s Song&quot;, she left teaching to write full-time and moved to Deer Isle, Maine. She is the mother of two children, Peter and Jessica.

==Awards and honors==

The ALA Margaret Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot;. Voigt won the annual award in 1995, citing seven books published from 1981 to 1986: &quot;Homecoming&quot;, &quot;Dicey&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;A Solitary Blue&quot;, &quot;Building Blocks&quot;, &quot;The Runner&quot;, &quot;Jackaroo&quot;, and &quot;Izzy, Willy-Nilly&quot;(‡). According to the YA librarians, her &quot;work for young adults over a period of years has provided an authentic voice ... Voigt&#x27;s intense character studies introduce young adults to genuine people often isolated from society. While her characters may be orphaned, abandoned, disabled, their strength to overcome adversity is extraordinary.&quot;

She has won several awards for particular works, too.

==Works==

===Tillerman Cycle===

The Tillerman Cycle follows the struggles of the eponymous family, beginning with &quot;Homecoming&quot;, in which one generation of Tillerman children is abandoned by their mother. The young foursome must find their way to their estranged grandmother, under the leadership of thirteen-year-old Dicey, the eldest sibling and main character of the series. Four of the books are, however, centered on other characters—&quot;The Runner&quot; follows Dicey&#x27;s uncle, Bullet. &quot;Come a Stranger&quot; and &quot;A Solitary Blue&quot; cover some of the same territory as &quot;Dicey&#x27;s Song&quot; from the perspectives of Mina and Jeff, respectively, who are two of Dicey&#x27;s friends. &quot;Sons from Afar&quot; focuses on Dicey&#x27;s brothers, James and Sammy. Throughout Voigt&#x27;s novels, she taps into the emotional aspects of the struggles of the Tillerman children, as well as the other protagonists of her novels, making the Tillerman cycle a series of books appropriate for all ages.

(‡) The first four Tillerman books were among seven cited when Voigt won the 1995 Edwards Award.

===Kingdom series===

The vast majority of Voigt&#x27;s work is marked by a contemporary or historical setting and a realistic style. The &quot;Kingdom&quot; books break from the former, being set in an unspecified but apparently invented region in a circa-medieval period of historical development. While the world is invented, however, it remains realistic in its construction, and resembles in most respects a historically faithful period setting, rather than a sword and sorcerer fairyland. What myths are present in the Kingdom are usually seen to have historical basis; the first novel, &quot;Jackaroo&quot;, deals with such a myth—a Robin Hood-like figure who is really just an archetype whose guise is donned by various nobles and commoners through the years.

The Kingdom books are connected by history and geography rather than the lifespan of any one character or family; though characters in later novels are sometimes descended from characters in earlier novels, their adventures are usually the stuff of myth or distant memory.

In recent years, the series was repackaged and the books were released under new titles: &quot;The Tale of Gwyn&quot; (previously published as &quot;Jackaroo&quot;), &quot;The Tale of Birle&quot; (previously published as &quot;On Fortune&#x27;s Wheel&quot;), &quot;The Tale of Oriel&quot; (previously published as &quot;The Wings of a Falcon&quot;), and &quot;The Tale of Elske&quot; (previously published as &quot;Elske&quot;).

<doc id="690202" wikidata="Q836672" url="?curid=690202" title="Regions of Kazakhstan">
<text>Kazakhstan is divided into 17 regions (; ; ; ) and 4 cities. The regions are further subdivided into districts (; ; ; ). The four cities, Almaty, Baikonur, Shymkent, and the capital city Astana, do not belong to their surrounding regions.

Initially there were 14 regions. On 16 March 2022, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced that three new regions would be created. Abai Region was created from East Kazakhstan Region with its capital in Semey. Ulytau Region was created from Karaganda Region with its capital in Jezkazgan. Jetisu Region was created from Almaty Region with its capital in Taldykorgan; Almaty Region&#x27;s capital was moved from Taldykorgan to Qonayev.

== Regions ==

== Demographic statistics ==
In 2022, three new regions were created - Abai (from part of East Kazakhstan), Jetisu (from part of Almaty Region) and Ulytau (from part of Karaganda Region). In the following table, the 2009 population totals have been amended to reflect the population in the new or altered regions.

== Former administrative boundaries ==

Over the last 60 years, both the distribution and names of regions of Kazakhstan have changed considerably. Major changes were several fusions and splits between Guryev and Mangystau, Karaganda and Dzhezkazgan, Almaty and Taldy-Kurgan, East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk and Kostanay, Turgay and Tselinograd, respectively. Changes in region names were often in line with the renaming of cities, such as in the case of Alma-Ata/Almaty. After the administrative reform in 1997, the last change happened since then took place in 1999, when parts of North Kazakhstan that originally belonged to Kokshetau region became part of Akmola. The 1990s merges were in order to dilute the Russian population in the resulting region and to avoid having regions where Russians form a majority.
== Notes ==
;Notes
: Almaty, Astana and Shymkent have the status of the city of republican significance, and as such do not relate to any region.
: The West Kazakhstan and Atyrau regions are both partly located in Eastern Europe as the Ural River runs through Atyrau and Oral, their respective capital cities.
: Baikonur city has a special status because it is currently being leased to Russia along with Baikonur Cosmodrome until the year 2050.

<doc id="690206" wikidata="Q867567" url="?curid=690206" title="Governorates of Jordan">
<text>Jordan is divided into twelve historical regions (&quot;almanatiq altaarikhia&quot;), further subdivided into districts (&quot;liwa&quot;), and often into sub-districts (&quot;qada&quot;).

==1994 reform==
In 1994, four new governorates were created as part of the administrative divisions system of the Ministry of Interior: Jerash, Ajloun, Madaba and Aqaba. Jerash Governorate and Ajloun Governorate were split from Irbid Governorate, Madaba Governorate was split from Amman Governorate and Aqaba Governorate was split from Ma&#x27;an Governorate.

==Geographical regions vs. metropolitan areas==
Geographically, the governorates of Jordan are located in one of three regions (aqalim): the North Region, Central Region and the South Region. The three geographical regions are not distributed by area or populations, but rather by geographical connectivity and distance among the population centres. The South Region is separated from the Central Region by the Mountains of Moab in Karak Governorate. The population centres of the Central and North Region are separated geographically by the mountains of Jerash Governorate.

Socially, the population centres of Amman, Salt, Zarqa and Madaba form together one large metropolitan area in which business interactions in these cities are under the influence of Amman, while the cities of Jerash, Ajloun, and Mafraq are mostly under the influence of the city of Irbid.

<doc id="690208" wikidata="Q1148498" url="?curid=690208" title="Trinovantum">
<text>Trinovantum is the name in medieval British legend that was given to London, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, when it was founded by the exiled Trojan Brutus, who called it &quot;Troia Nova&quot; (&quot;New Troy&quot;), which was gradually corrupted to &quot;Trinovantum&quot;. The legend says that it was later rebuilt by King Lud, who named it &quot;Caer Lud&quot; (&quot;Lud&#x27;s Fort&quot;) after himself and that the name became corrupted to &quot;Kaer Llundain&quot; and finally London. The legend is part of the Matter of Britain. 
The name &quot;Trinovantum&quot; derives from the Iron Age tribe of the Trinovantes, who lived in Essex, Suffolk and part of Greater London and are mentioned by Julius Caesar in his account of his expeditions to Britain in 55 and 54 BC. In a later account of those expeditions by Orosius, they are referred to as &quot;civitas Trinovantum&quot;, &quot;the nation of the Trinovantes&quot;, with &quot;Trinovantum&quot; in this case being in the genitive plural. However, as &quot;civitas&quot; can also mean &quot;city&quot; and Latin neuter nouns often end in &quot;-um&quot; in the nominative singular, this phrase was misinterpreted by Geoffrey or his sources as &quot;the city Trinovantum&quot;.

In Roman times, the city was known by the name Londinium, which appears to be cognate with &quot;Llundain&quot; and &quot;London&quot;.

<text>Dr. Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Carter, USAF is a fictional character in the Canadian–American military science fiction &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise. Played by Amanda Tapping, she appears in all three shows in the franchise: &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. She was a main character in all ten seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (1997–2007). Following a recurring role in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; for three seasons (2004–07), Carter became a main character in Season 4 of &quot;Atlantis&quot; (2007–08), and also appeared in the 2008 direct-to-DVD &quot;SG-1&quot; films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Amanda Tapping accepted a starring role in &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and appears in only the first and last episodes in Season 5 of &quot;Atlantis&quot; (2008–09). Carter also appears in two episodes of Season 1 of &quot;Stargate Universe.&quot;

Captain Samantha Carter first appears in &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, as a United States Air Force captain who joined the fictional SG-1 team under the command of Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill. After being promoted to major in Season 3, Carter remains O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s second-in-command until her promotion to lieutenant colonel early in Season 8, at which point she assumes command of the SG-1 team and O&#x27;Neill is promoted to brigadier general in order to lead Stargate Command. Between Seasons 8 and 9 of SG-1, following the defeat of the Replicators and downfall of the Goa&#x27;uld system lords, she accepts a position as Head of the Stargate Research and Development Program, based in Nevada. She is engaged in deep-space research when the Ori emerge. Upon her return to Earth, she is reassigned to SG-1, now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell. Following the defeat of the Ori in &quot;Stargate: The Ark of Truth&quot;, Carter is promoted to full colonel and appointed as commander of the Atlantis expedition early in Season 4 of &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Carter is later given command of the Daedalus-class ship, the &quot;George Hammond&quot;.

Unofficially in the online game &quot;&quot;, it is implied by visual screenshots showing a general&#x27;s office with her name on the desk label that she eventually succeeds Major General Hank Landry as commander of the SGC, implying an offscreen (non-canonical) promotion to brigadier general.

Overall, Carter is the character with the most appearances across the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise, though ranking as second-mostbehind Teal&#x27;cin the series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;.

==Role in &quot;Stargate&quot;==
===Character arc in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;===
Before the present-time events of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Samantha Carter worked at the Pentagon for several years, trying to get the Stargate operational. She has a Ph.D. in theoretical astrophysics and &quot;logged over 100 hours in enemy airspace&quot; during the Gulf War. She is the daughter of Major General Jacob Carter, and has a brother named Mark. Her mother died in a car accident when she was a teenager.

Holding the rank of captain, Samantha Carter joins the SG-1 team in the pilot episode, &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;. She comes under the temporary control of the Tok&#x27;ra Jolinar in season 2 and retains many of her memories, leading to an alliance with the Tok&#x27;ra against the Goa&#x27;uld. Carter&#x27;s brief merging with Jolinar also assists her in detecting a Goa&#x27;uld presence and using certain Goa&#x27;uld technology. Carter is promoted to the rank of major early in season 3. When an advanced lie detector shows they are concealing something in early season 4, it forces Carter and her superior officer, Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill, to admit that they care for one another &quot;a lot more than [they&#x27;re] supposed to&quot;. In Exodus (season 4), Carter uses a stargate to destroy a star by dialing the gate on P3W-451, the planet being consumed by a black hole (originally discovered in A Matter of Time), and launching the active stargate into the nearby star; the resulting imbalance in mass causes the star to go supernova and destroy Apophis&#x27;s fleet.

Trapped on board the Earth ship &quot;Prometheus&quot; in season 7&#x27;s &quot;Grace&quot;, Carter realizes that her feelings for O&#x27;Neill stop her from exploring other romances. Two episodes later in Chimera, Carter begins dating her brother&#x27;s friend Pete Shanahan, but Pete disrespects her privacy and the confidential nature of her work. Pete gaslights her and stalks her until she is forced to disclose her job to him. In the season 8 premiere, &quot;New Order&quot;, Carter gets captured by a humanoid Replicator named Fifth she had first encountered in season 6&#x27;s &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;. Fifth eventually releases her, but keeps a replicator copy of her, known commonly as &#x27;RepliCarter&#x27;. Upon O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s promotion to brigadier general in the same episode, he promotes her to lieutenant colonel. Carter assumes command of the SG-1 team, which includes the de-ascended Daniel Jackson, the alien Teal&#x27;c, and herself. Shortly after the death of her father in late season 8, Carter breaks up with Pete and goes fishing with Jack, Daniel, and Teal&#x27;c to celebrate the defeat of the System Lords.

Season 9 reveals that Carter left SG-1 to work at Area 51 after the collapse of the Goa&#x27;uld power structure. After Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell assumes command of SG-1, General O&#x27;Neill orders Carter to assist SG-1 on a mission concerning the new Ori threat. Carter officially rejoins SG-1 in the season 9 episode &quot;Ex Deus Machina&quot;. Samantha Carter appears in the 2008 direct-to-DVD films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===Character arc in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;===
Lieutenant Colonel Carter makes her first appearance in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; at the end of its first season (airing in parallel to season 8 of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;), receiving a very brief data transmission from the Atlantis expedition to Earth. The &quot;Atlantis&quot; character Dr. Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) has a hallucination of Carter which enables him to survive while trapped in a sinking Puddle Jumper in season 2. Lieutenant Colonel Carter approaches McKay&#x27;s sister Jeannie Miller with an offer to work for Stargate Command in season 3. At an unknown point after the end of the Ori conflict in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Carter is promoted to a &quot;full bird&quot; colonel and is transferred to the Midway space station to oversee the final stages of completion. The IOA appoints Carter as the new commander of the Atlantis expedition early in season 4 of &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

Carter finds the Atlantis command experience quite relaxed in terms of military protocol, but enjoys it nonetheless (&quot;Midway&quot;). True to her SG-1 heritage, she conducts herself bravely by actively taking part in missions (&quot;Reunion&quot;, &quot;Trio&quot;) and protecting and defending those under her command (&quot;Be All My Sins Remember&#x27;d&quot;, &quot;Search and Rescue&quot;). Carter even builds a more amicable relationship with Dr. Rodney McKay, having put their past tensions aside, and clearly respects Lt. Colonel Sheppard&#x27;s command and past accomplishments in the Pegasus Galaxy.

Carter is recalled to Earth at the end of the first episode of season five for a Tok&#x27;ra extraction ceremony concerning the final Ba&#x27;al clone (a ceremony witnessed in &quot;&quot;), followed by an exhaustive first-year command review by the International Oversight Advisory (IOA). Upon arrival, however, Richard Woolsey informs her that the IOA has removed her from command, and that he will be replacing her. As of &quot;Enemy at the Gate&quot;, she is the temporary SGC base commander while General Hank Landry is heading a task force based in Washington. After this assignment she is to be made commander of the new Daedalus Class (BC-304) battlecruiser, formerly known as the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, now named the &quot;George Hammond&quot; in memory of General George Hammond.

===&quot;Stargate Universe&quot;===
Carter is in command of the &quot;George Hammond&quot; when it ferries personnel from Earth to Icarus Base to witness the latest attempt to dial the ninth chevron. The &quot;Hammond&quot; attempts to fight off the assault on the base by a fleet of Goa&#x27;uld ships that Carter presumes belong to the Lucian Alliance. Although they are unsuccessful in preventing the destruction of the base, they are able to rescue most of the survivors stranded outside, including Colonel David Telford, who was to command the expedition to &quot;Destiny&quot;. She also appears later in season 1 where she is the officer in charge of the assault on the Lucian Alliance base.

===Relationships===
Over the course of the two shows, a number of men are in love with, infatuated with, or attracted to, Carter. This includes Jack O&#x27;Neill, the Tok&#x27;ra Martouf, Dr. Rodney McKay, Fifth, Orlin, Agent Malcolm Barrett, Narim, Pete Shanahan, Dr. Jay Felger, her former fiancé Jonas Hanson, and Joseph Faxon (her duplicitous husband of a possible future in Season 4, episode 16, &quot;2010&quot;). Many of these individuals have (presumably) since died, including: Martouf (and symbiote Lantash); Fifth; Narim; Hanson; and two alternate versions of Jack O&#x27;Neill. This has led many of the cast and crew of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; to humorously nickname her character Samantha &quot;the Black Widow&quot; Carter.

Asked why the series never confirmed a relationship between Carter and O&#x27;Neill, producer Joseph Mallozzi stated in his blog,
The Sam/Jack relationship was fraught with complications, given that he was her commanding officer. Pursuing any sort of relationship would have been inappropriate for both and would only have really been possible late in the series after Jack&#x27;s retirement. [...] Jack and Sam could have gotten together after Jack&#x27;s retirement, but it was never made canon because, quite frankly, it wasn&#x27;t my call. Still, despite the lack of official confirmation, it was only natural that they should get together after the events of Threads and, in my mind, they have been together ever since. An attempt to suggest as much in [Stargate Atlantis&#x27;] season 4&#x27;s Trio, unfortunately, ended up on the cutting room floor when the episode ran long.

In season 9, episode 7, Sam catches up with Malcolm Barrett and tells him that she and Pete had broken up. He asks if she is single, and she responds, &quot;not exactly.&quot;

When Carter joins the Atlantis expedition as commanding officer, a framed photo of O&#x27;Neill is seen on top of a box of her personal effects. A scene was cut from the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; season 4 episode &quot;Trio&quot; in which Carter and Dr. Jennifer Keller discuss their love lives. When asked by Keller if she&#x27;s seeing anyone, Carter initially avoids the question before admitting that &quot;it&#x27;s complicated&quot; and that the man in question is in Washington D.C. but is going to retire soon.
In episode 12, season 10, Samantha is shot and reveals to Mitchell that she has a file on her laptop with letters to people who she cares for in case she dies. The password is &#x27;fishing,&#x27; an apparent reference to O&#x27;Neill.

Carmen Argenziano, the actor who plays Carter&#x27;s father Jacob Carter, was asked in an interview who would be a good match for his on-screen daughter. He said:
I like Daniel Jackson. I felt that Daniel would have been the right choice because Daniel is well-educated, is intelligent, gentlemanly and he was everything that I envisioned that my daughter would end up with.
===SG-1 leadership===
Carter first assumes command of SG-1 in &quot;SG-1&quot;″s season 2 episode &quot;Spirits&quot; when Jack O&#x27;Neill is in the infirmary injured. Carter takes over command from O&#x27;Neill as SG-1 leader at the end of season 7. Hammond had instructed Carter to relieve O&#x27;Neill of duty had she deemed him too unstable while under the influence of the Repository of the Ancients. O&#x27;Neill subsequently &quot;quits&quot; to avoid making Carter feel guilty. When Amanda Tapping was on maternity leave at the beginning of season 9, Cameron Mitchell was introduced as the leader of SG-1 who would bring the team back together. Following negative fan reactions to Carter&#x27;s cancelled leadership within the team, Ben Browder noted the production difficulties that came with Amanda Tapping&#x27;s maternity leave, and pointed out that new leaders are brought in routinely into units of the military. Tapping admitted to also have been &quot;kind of put off&quot; upon learning that someone else would lead SG-1, hoping that the producers would make SG-1 more of an ensemble team in season 10 by removing the patriarchal line of command. The writers eventually decided after an animated discussion during season 9 that Mitchell and Carter would co-command the team, although they left Mitchell in the official leadership position. Tapping considered the question of leadership in season 10 irrelevant; Mitchell cannot give orders to his team since he and Carter hold the same military rank, and Daniel and Teal&#x27;c are not members of the United States military.

==Conceptual history==

During the casting process of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the producers were looking for an actress who could portray a strong woman whom the audience would accept as a soldier. The character should have had combat training and have been in wars, but should also be a brilliant scientist and a beautiful woman. Amanda Tapping at first assumed that the show would put more emphasis on intellect, but found that it was an action-adventure scifi show where the characters often got physical. Tapping described Carter as a cross between Jack O&#x27;Neill and Daniel Jackson, and the conflict of her character whether to go the scientific route or with military protocol.

Amanda Tapping was part of the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; main cast for all of the show&#x27;s ten seasons. She did not appear in season 6&#x27;s &quot;Disclosure&quot; or season 7&#x27;s &quot;Inauguration&quot; except in clips from previous episodes and was completely absent from season 8&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; and the season nine episodes &quot;Avalon (Part 2)&quot;, &quot;Origin&quot;, &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; and &quot;The Powers That Be&quot; due to Tapping&#x27;s maternity leave (she appeared briefly in &quot;Avalon (Part 1)&quot; to explain her absence); and season ten&#x27;s &quot;Bad Guys&quot;.

While Amanda Tapping was part of the main cast of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, she made several cameo appearances in the first three seasons of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Amanda Tapping became a member of the &quot;Atlantis&quot; main cast for 14 episodes of Season 4. She did not appear in &quot;Travelers&quot;, &quot;Missing&quot;, &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, &quot;This Mortal Coil&quot;, &quot;Spoils of War&quot; and &quot;Harmony&quot;.

Tapping sat down with Robert C. Cooper at the beginning of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;&#x27;s season 7 to discuss Carter&#x27;s struggle with her demons and her life choices in regards to work and family. The events of &quot;Grace&quot; are left open for interpretation, both for the audience and the actors. Grace could be Sam&#x27;s child within, her hopes and dreams for having a child, the child Sam left behind when she started her career as an astrophysicist, or Carter&#x27;s potential future with a family. &quot;Chimera&quot; is an offshoot of what happened in &quot;Grace&quot;, and the writers were trying to &quot;dispel the black widow curse that Carter has, and also to open her up for more experiences and to flesh her out just a little bit more as a human being&quot;. Tapping felt out of her element doing these two episodes, as the flirty side of the character had not really been explored in the show until then. Also, Pete Shanahan does not die, which confuses Carter. According to Tapping, Carter is oblivious what lengths Shanahan is going (stalking, background checks) to find out more about her classified life, although the character is finally free to talk about her life at the end of episode.

Several fans refused to watch the episode &quot;Chimera&quot; because Carter was getting involved with someone other than who they wanted her to be involved with. Tapping received letters of fans who said that Carter&#x27;s integrity &quot;is completely out the window, and, &#x27;What the hell [were you] thinking.&#x27;&quot; According to Tapping, Carter &quot;harbors great depth of feeling for Colonel O&#x27;Neill, but because nothing can ever happen ... He&#x27;s the one who let her go. He says, &#x27;I&#x27;m a safe bet. You know you can&#x27;t have me so you&#x27;re just protecting your heart by, you know, hanging your hat on someone you can&#x27;t have. So, let me go,&#x27; is essentially what&#x27;s said at the end of &quot;Grace&quot;&quot;. Tapping said,

The whole episode is her sort of rethinking her life and rethinking her choices, and I don&#x27;t think that she&#x27;s lost integrity. I don&#x27;t think that her feelings for O&#x27;Neill are any less. I think she&#x27;s just placed them in a different box, if you will. It was weird, I have to say, for her to hand her heart over to somebody else. But it&#x27;s baby steps for her, and this is all new for her. And I think it&#x27;s ultimately O&#x27;Neill who says, &#x27;You have to move on.&#x27; And it&#x27;s her father, too, who says, you know, &#x27;Don&#x27;t give up your chance of love. You know, I would live my whole life over again even knowing that your mother&#x27;s gonna die, I would do all that again.&#x27; So it&#x27;s her opening up her heart as opposed to actually – it&#x27;s been closed this whole time because she&#x27;s, you know, been protecting it with thoughts of O&#x27;Neill, who she knows she can&#x27;t have, so it opens her up.

Working around Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s reduced schedule was a challenge for Tapping. Nevertheless, Tapping, Michael Shanks and Christopher Judge knew going into season 7 that this allowed for their characters to be fleshed out a bit more and to have a bit more screen time. She did not think the dynamics or the chemistry of the team had suffered.

Unlike O&#x27;Neill and Jackson, Carter did not appear in the series premiere of &quot;Atlantis&quot;. This was probably to do with the legalities of her being a character specifically created for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Tapping considered the elevator scene with Cassandra in season 1&#x27;s &quot;Singularity&quot; to be one of the scenes to best fully capture Carter.

==Reception==
For her portrayal of Samantha Carter, Amanda Tapping was nominated for a 2000 Leo Award in the category &quot;Dramatic Series: Best Lead Performance – Female&quot; for the episode &quot;Point of View&quot;, and won the Leo for &quot;Ascension&quot; in 2003, for &quot;Grace&quot; in 2004, and for &quot;Threads&quot; in 2005. Tapping was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category &quot;Best Supporting Actress on Television&quot; in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. Tapping was nominated for a 2001 Gemini Award in the category &quot;Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role&quot;. In 2008 Amanda Tapping was nominated for a Constellation Award nomination in the category &quot;Outstanding Canadian Contribution to Science Fiction Film or Television in 2008&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; reviewed the pilot episode &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, where he stated that Tapping&#x27;s character was &quot;Pushy&quot; and her acting was &quot;Wooden&quot;. Tory Ireland Mell, reviewer from IGN said that Carter&#x27;s season four presence on Stargate Atlantis was &quot;underused&quot; and a &quot;slap in the face&quot; to her character. In 2008, Amanda Tapping started to produce her own web series entitled &quot;Sanctuary&quot; with Damian Kindler and Martin Wood among others. Many reviewers have felt that Tapping accepted the role of Doctor Helen Magnus to make a name of herself outside the &quot;Stargate&quot; universe as Samantha Carter. AOL named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.

<text>Accie Julius Connor (born October 22, 1973), better known by his ring name D&#x27;Lo Brown (also formatted as D-Lo Brown), is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to TNA Wrestling, where he works as a producer. He is best known for his time with WWE. Brown is also known for his appearances in Ring of Honor, All Japan Pro Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling Noah.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1994–1997) ===

Connor began his wrestling career in New Jersey as &quot;Ace the Animal&quot;. He then wrestled Earthquake in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1994 under his given name as a jobber.

Connor debuted in Smoky Mountain Wrestling in September 1994 as &quot;A.C. Conner&quot;. In October 1994, he was renamed &quot;&#x27;Downtown&#x27; D&#x27;Lo Brown&quot; and introduced as the head of security for the Gangstas (Mustapha Saed and New Jack). Brown was the worker of the stable, complementing Saed&#x27;s size and Jack&#x27;s animated personality. He regularly wrestled on Smoky Mountain Wrestling&#x27;s television show, unsuccessfully challenged for the SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship on several occasions. At Sunday Bloody Sunday II in February 1995, the Gangstas lost to the Heavenly Bodies and Jim Cornette. At Bluegrass Brawl III in April 1995, the Gangstas lost to Tracy Smothers and The Undertaker in a handicap match. Brown wrestled his final match for Smoky Mountain Wrestling in October 1995. 

After leaving Smoky Mountain Wrestling, Brown signed a deal with the WWF and was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association for more training while also making appearances as a jobber on WWF television. Brown also spent most of 1996 wrestling in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (1997–2003) ===
==== Nation of Domination (1997–1998) ====
In April 1997, Brown was reintroduced to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as a member of Faarooq&#x27;s heel Nation of Domination stable, debuting as one of several non-descript people in suits that accompanied the group to the ring. During this time, his most notable moment was when Ahmed Johnson slammed him onto the roof of a car during &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;. His first televised match as a member of the Nation was on the April 26, 1997, episode of &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;, as he, Crush, and Savio Vega defeated Aldo Montoya, Steve Corino, and Freddie Joe Floyd. On May 26, 1997, he had his first match on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, defeating Bob &quot;Spark Plugg&quot; Holly. After the King of the Ring 1997, Faarooq fired the rest of the Nation&#x27;s members, except for D-Lo, who was later joined by Ahmed Johnson (later replaced by Rocky Maivia), Kama Mustafa, and Mark Henry. 

In early 1998, the Nation of Domination turned on Faarooq, allowing Maivia, now going by the name &quot;The Rock&quot;, to assume leadership. During this period Kama also changed his name to &quot;The Godfather&quot; and began portraying a pimp character. Brown and Henry eventually turned on both Rock and Godfather separately, moving into a feud with the Rock before finally branching out as a moderately successful tag team, later turning face along the way. Prior to the face turn, Brown had started wrestling with a chest protector, supposedly for a torn pectoral muscle sustained in a match against Dan &quot;The Beast&quot; Severn. Instead, he used the chest protector to his advantage, making his finishing move, the Lo Down, more effective.

==== Title pursuit (1998–2000) ====
In 1998, he feuded with X-Pac over the WWF European Championship. His career peaked when he held the European and Intercontinental Championships simultaneously during a feud with Jeff Jarrett and Mark Henry. This feat has only been duplicated by Jeff Jarrett, Kurt Angle, and Rob Van Dam, all of whom became world champions in some form, later in their careers.

Brown was involved in inadvertently ending the career of Droz on October 5, 1999, when a running powerbomb was botched due to Droz&#x27;s baggy shirt. The match was filmed for the October 7 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but was never aired. Droz suffered a severe neck injury, rendering him a quadriplegic. During an interview with Title Match Wrestling, Brown dispelled a popular rumor that a fan had thrown an object into the ring which caused him to slip and badly injure Darren Drozdov. Brown took responsibility for botching the move, stating that the accident could have happened to &quot;any&quot; wrestler he had been in the ring with that night. He also said the accident caused him to &quot;wrestle differently&quot; and to second guess every move he performed in the ring from that day forward. Drozdov maintained that he did not blame Brown for his injuries and believed the incident was an accident.

During the rest of the year and into some of the next, Brown became an ally of former fellow Nation member The Godfather, emulating his dress and walking motions. The teaming ended when Brown turned heel on the Godfather.

==== Lo Down (2000–2001) ====
Brown then formed a tag team in July 2000 with Chaz named &quot;Lo Down&quot;. The team mostly wrestled on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; and &quot;WWE Jakked / Metal&quot;. Shortly after the team formed, Tiger Ali Singh joined the team to become their manager. The tag team then came dressed towards the ring in Sikh attire and took on a gimmick very similar to Tiger&#x27;s. The team was removed from WWF television in January 2001 after Singh was injured. According to Brown, it was the lowest point in his career. Chaz and Singh were later released by WWE while Brown stayed in WWE&#x27;s developmental territory, OVW. Notably, Brown wrestled future World champion Batista in a losing effort. Brown also spent six months in Puerto Rico wrestling for the International Wrestling Association teaming with Glamour Boy Shane holding the IWA tag team titles. Later that year he returned to OVW and worked for Heartland Wrestling Association going into 2002.

====Alliance with Theodore Long (2002–2003)====

Brown returned to television on the April 28, 2002, episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, losing to Eddie Guerrero. For the rest of the year, Brown mostly wrestled on &quot;Heat&quot;, did a little bit of commentary on the show, and even started a brief feud with Raven. In late 2002, Theodore Long retired as a WWE referee and managed D&#x27;Lo, who had complained about acts of racism during his matches. D&#x27;Lo started Long&#x27;s group Thuggin&#x27; and Buggin&#x27; Enterprises which eventually turned into a group of African Americans who worked an angle in which they felt they were victims of racism and were being held down by the &quot;white man&quot;. With Long&#x27;s managerial services, D&#x27;Lo Brown went undefeated for several weeks.

Brown faced Booker T in a losing effort on the February 10, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.
