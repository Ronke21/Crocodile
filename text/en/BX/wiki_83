<text>Kazaam () is a 1996 American musical fantasy comedy film directed by Paul Michael Glaser, written by Christian Ford and Roger Soffer based on a story by Glaser, and starring Shaquille O&#x27;Neal as the title character, a 5,000-year-old genie who appears from a magic boombox to grant a 14-year-old boy three wishes.

The film was released on July 17, 1996, grossing $18.9 million on its $20 million budget. It was panned by critics, who criticized the screenplay and O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s performance.

==Plot==
In the story, a wrecking ball demolishes an abandoned building, causing a magic lamp inside to fall onto a boombox. The genie inside, named Kazaam, decides to reside in the boombox. Meanwhile, a 12-year-old boy named Max Conner goes to school and faces various challenges. He deals with bullies who retaliate against him for a failed robbery attempt. Max seeks refuge in the abandoned building and accidentally releases Kazaam from the boombox. Kazaam becomes Max&#x27;s genie and demonstrates his powers before disappearing.

Max notices his father during his journey home and discovers that his mother plans to marry a fireman named Travis O&#x27;Neil. Max resents Travis and confronts his mother about hiding the truth about his real father&#x27;s whereabouts. Determined to find his father, Max encounters Kazaam again, who pesters him into making a wish. Max eventually reunites with his father, Nick Matteo, a musical talent agent involved in unauthorized music. Although Max initially does not care about his father&#x27;s profession, he is happy to see him and is introduced to the employees of Nick&#x27;s agency.

Max shares the news with Kazaam and they have a bike race in Max&#x27;s hideout, where Kazaam showcases his powers. Kazaam persuades Max to make his first wish, causing junk food to rain from the sky. Max realizes that he has control over Kazaam until he uses his last two wishes. They visit Max&#x27;s father again and attend a show where Kazaam&#x27;s genie abilities impress Malik, the nightclub owner who desires to control Kazaam.

Kazaam stays at Max&#x27;s home, pretending to be his tutor. Max confides in Kazaam about his strained relationship with his father, and Kazaam shares a rap about his own genie origins. Max tries to wish for his parents to rekindle their love, but Kazaam cannot grant this wish since he is not a djinn.

Later, Max witnesses his father being attacked by Malik and his hitmen over a stolen master tape, which Max was pressured into by his bullies. Max seeks help from Kazaam, who hesitates due to his newfound success as a rapper. Max uses his second wish to conjure a replacement tape, causing a rift between him and Kazaam. Max&#x27;s father confronts him about the stolen tape, leading to their separation.

That night, Max is kidnapped by Malik, who takes control of Kazaam&#x27;s boombox. Max&#x27;s father is also held captive. Malik tries to force Kazaam to do his bidding, but Kazaam breaks free from the boombox&#x27;s control and defeats Malik and his minions. Kazaam transforms Malik into a basketball and dunks him into a garbage disposal. However, Kazaam discovers Max&#x27;s lifeless body and regrets not being able to grant Max&#x27;s wish for a second chance with his father.

In his grief, Kazaam becomes a djinn, granting him the power to bring Max back to life and grant his third wish for his father to have a second chance to escape his criminal life. Kazaam saves Max and carries him out of the burning building, where Travis rescues him. Max&#x27;s father expresses his desire to rebuild their relationship before leaving with the authorities. Kazaam, now a djinn, walks away, facing the lighthearted annoyance of his new girlfriend, who pressures him into getting a job, while unaware of the concept of a job. Max watches Kazaam walk away with a smile.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s origins began with director Paul Michael Glaser taking his son to the NBA All-Star game, when an acquaintance, who was on Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s management team, called and asked if his son would like to meet him. After saying yes, the acquaintance asked, in passing, if he knew of any film roles for Shaquille to which Glaser replied, &#x27;He should play a genie.&#x27; Which laid the foundation for what would become &quot;Kazaam&quot;. In a very short time, Glaser took &quot;Kazaam&quot; to Warner Bros. as they had the Michael Jordan project &quot;Space Jam&quot;, and Glaser also went back to Interscope Communications, where he had already done two pictures. Glaser had to have a screenplay and a green light in ten and a half weeks, or he wouldn&#x27;t be able to make the movie as Shaquille had to go back to basketball camp. The script was written in six and a half weeks with production commencing after ten before going into Turnaround where it was acquired by Disney.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Kazaam&quot; has an approval rating of 5% based on 37 reviews and an average rating of 2.82/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Crafted from a mix of genre clich√©s, &quot;Kazaam&quot; doesn&#x27;t know what kind of film it wants to be, and Shaq&#x27;s larger-than-life charisma is stifled by rote filmmaking and an unimaginative story.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 24 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars, writing: &quot;Shaq has already proven he can act (in &quot;Blue Chips&quot;, the 1994 movie about college basketball). Here he shows he can be likable in a children&#x27;s movie. What he does not show is good judgment in his choice of material. [...] the filmmakers didn&#x27;t care to extend themselves beyond the obvious commercial possibilities of their first dim idea.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the film one star and described the film as &quot;the kind of project someone probably told Shaq would sell to kids. It&#x27;s marketing, not moviemaking.&quot;

Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s performance in the film was considered poor and has since been referenced in a number of movies, including &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, mainly either criticizing his acting or gloating about it. The film grossed $18.9 million against a $20 million production budget. In a 2012 interview with &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, O&#x27;Neal said: &quot;I was a medium-level juvenile delinquent from Newark who always dreamed about doing a movie. Someone said, &#x27;Hey, here&#x27;s $7 million, come in and do this genie movie.&#x27; What am I going to say, no? So I did it.&quot;

== &quot;Shazaam&quot; ==

Many people falsely remember a similar 1990s film titled &quot;Shazaam&quot;, starring comedian and actor Sinbad as a genie. However, no such film ever existed, and it is possible people are misremembering &quot;Kazaam&quot; as the aforementioned film. Sinbad denied having ever starred in &quot;Shazaam&quot; on Twitter. One theory for the belief in &quot;Shazaam&quot; is that Sinbad wore a genie costume while introducing the 1977 film &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot; on TNT in 1994. In addition, in the late 1960s, Hanna-Barbera had an animated series about a genie called &quot;Shazzan&quot;.

The earliest online reference to &quot;Shazaam&quot; dates to 2009, when an anonymous Yahoo! Answers user made a post asking other users if they remembered a 1990s movie starring Sinbad as a genie, finding no success in finding others who shared their memories. Isolated incidents of Internet users asking about the movie would pop up over the next years: In 2011, Reddit user /u/MJGSimple made a post likewise asking users about the movie, and recalled its title to be &quot;Shazaam&quot;, although they were not certain about its title. On 11 August 2015, Vice News published a story discussing the &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; and its relation to the Mandela Effect, which helped popularize the r/MandelaEffect Reddit community, where users flocked to discuss &quot;Shazaam&quot;. Afterwards, discussions of the alleged Sinbad film sharply rose in prominence.
As an April Fools&#x27; Day prank in 2017, CollegeHumor released a parody VHS trailer for &quot;Shazaam&quot; starring Sinbad, in which he plays a genie who gets released from his lamp by two children, Rachael and James.

During the production of &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot; (2023), director David F. Sandberg planned to give Sinbad a cameo role as a nod to the alleged 1990s film. However, Sinbad cancelled the appearance due to health issues.

<text>The urogenital opening is where bodily waste and reproductive fluids are expelled to the environment outside of the body cavity. In some organisms, including monotremes, birds and some fish, discharge from the urological, digestive, and reproductive systems empty into a common sac called the cloaca.

In most mammals, these three systems are more separated. In females (specifically primates and rodents), separate orifices have evolved for all three, while males discharge urine and semen from the urethra through a common urinary meatus. In marsupials and most placentals, the female urethra and vagina open into a urogenital sinus with a common urogenital opening (vulvar opening in placentals).

<doc id="683433" wikidata="Q5136415" url="?curid=683433" title="Club cricket">
<text>Club cricket is a mainly amateur, but still formal form of the sport of cricket, usually involving teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening. There is a great deal of variation in game format although the Laws of Cricket are observed. The main nations that club cricket is played in include Pakistan, England, Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Nepal, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Netherlands, Hong Kong and in some of the major cities in India. Club cricket is also now played in the United States and Canada, as both countries have large communities of immigrants from mainstream cricket-playing regions such as the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia.

==Format==
Club cricket is usually played in league or cup format. Games are limited by either time or overs. A less common, but more traditional, format is limiting the game by time only. Games can range from a few hours in the evening to three days long.

Saturday league cricket is the most serious format of club cricket. The game will usually be a limited overs contest of between 40 and 60 overs per side, with bonus points awarded based on runs, wickets, and whether or not the match was a &quot;winning draw&quot; or an outright win to one-side. This format of cricket covers teams that vary in standard between occasional players in the lower divisions to professional and ex-professional players in the highest leagues.

Friendly cricket often takes place on a Sunday. These games tend to follow the more traditional format of declaration cricket in which a time limit or number of overs - typically 80 to 120 - is set for the whole match. It is then up to the team batting first to declare their innings early enough to give themselves time to bowl the opposition out and force victory. The widest variety of cricket is generally seen in this format, with teams batting second either aggressively chasing a total or attempting to bat conservatively and save the draw.

Evening cricket is the least formal format of club cricket, and the route by which many new players are introduced to the game. It tends to follow the 20-20 version of the game, with additional time saving measures such as using 15 8-ball overs and not re-bowling wides or no-balls (which then count as 2 runs each rather than the standard 1). This version of the game also puts an emphasis on inclusivity, with rules such as each bowler being limited to 2 overs each, and batsmen retiring after reaching 25 runs being used to ensure that every player has a part to play in the outcome of the game.

Finally, in Australia and New Zealand two day matches are occasionally played over both Saturday and Sunday, or, alternatively, over successive Saturdays (though this can sometimes have unfortunate effects on the game where the condition of the pitch and ground changes radically from one week to the next). These matches usually have two innings per side.

==Standard==

Most players are amateur, but often cricket clubs employ the services of professionals as coaches and players. Many of these have played first-class or Test cricket. Also, first-class players returning from injury will sometimes appear at club level as match practice - for example, Shoaib Akhtar during Pakistan&#x27;s tour of England in 2006 when he played for Berkswell C.C, a club who are in the well-known Birmingham League. Similarly, Steve Smith and David Warner played in Sydney Grade Cricket during their suspension from the Australia national cricket team during 2018-19.

Standards of play can vary from semi-professional to occasional recreational level. While many clubs train in similar ways to professional teams, village or park cricket is played purely for fun, and club cricket is often enjoyed as much for the social element as for the competition. This is particularly true in England where the between-innings teas and post-match beer are as important as the result. However, this may vary depending on the standard.

==Officials==

In the higher leagues, umpires are appointed by the local umpires association to preside over the game and receive a fee and transport allowance for their time. However, as the number of umpires available is typically considerably less than the number of games scheduled, the majority of games are played without externally appointed umpires. In this scenario, members of the batting side not currently involved in the action take it in turns to take on the umpiring responsibilities, typically in stints of 10 or 15 overs at a time. The umpires are expected to remain impartial and unbiased in their judgements, and although a small degree of bias is occasionally perceived, this arrangement functions remarkably well.

The same scenario applies to scorers. Some teams may have an official scorer who attends all of their home games, but often it is simply left to the batting side to keep score. It is expected that this task is undertaken with impartiality. One means for the fielding side to prevent cheating is to ensure that the scoreboard is updated at the end of each over. This way any unexpected change in the number of runs and wickets would quickly be noticed and challenged.

==Facilities==

Club cricket is played extensively in most cricketing nations, and also by immigrants from cricketing nations. Club cricket can take place on an artificial turf pitch or a more traditional grass pitch. A traditional grass pitch is compulsory in the UK for entry into the higher divisions of club competitions. The rest of the actual field is always natural grass.

Most clubs have their own ground to play on regularly, including a field and pavilion or club house. Some also have nets for practice. These facilities may be owned or leased by the club itself, or may be provided by the local authority. A groundsman may be employed to look after the pitch and the outfield on either a full-time or part-time basis, or in smaller clubs the pitch may be maintained by the players themselves on a voluntary basis.

Clubs without grounds are known as &quot;wandering&quot; or &quot;nomadic&quot; clubs. Examples include the various sides affiliated to larger clubs, such as the club MCC sides and county &quot;Gentlemen of&quot; sides that often play against schools; school old boy sides, such as Eton Ramblers and Harrow Wanderers, which often play in the Cricketer Cup; and amateur clubs such as the Free Foresters, I Zingari and the XL Club.

Whereas professional cricketers often tour abroad during the winter, many amateur cricket clubs play indoor cricket during the winter months, leading to a full 12 month calendar of cricket fixtures for the keen amateur cricketer.

<text>Space elevator economics compares the cost of sending a payload into Earth orbit via a space elevator with the cost of doing so with alternatives, like rockets.

==Costs of current systems (rockets)==

The costs of using a well-tested system to launch payloads are high. The main cost comes from the components of the launch system that are not intended to be reused, which normally burn up in the atmosphere or are sent to graveyard orbits. Even when reusing components, there is often a high refurbishment cost. For geostationary transfer orbits, prices are as low as about US$11,300/kg for a Falcon Heavy or Falcon 9 launch. Costs of low Earth orbit launches are significantly less, but this is not the intended orbit for a space elevator. 

=== Proposed cost reductions ===

Various adaptations of the conventional rocket design have been proposed to reduce the cost. Several are currently in development, like the SpaceX Starship. An aspirational price for this fully reusable launch vehicle is , significantly cheaper than most proposed space elevators. New Glenn is also currently in development, a partially reusable rocket that promises to reduce price. However, an exact cost per launch has not been specified. Others, like the Sea Dragon and Roton have failed to get sufficient funding. The Space Shuttle promised a large cost reduction, but financially underperformed due to the extensive refurbishment costs needed after every launch.

==Cost estimates for a space elevator==
For a space elevator, the cost varies according to the design. Bradley C. Edwards received funding from NIAC from 2001 to 2003 to write a paper, describing a space elevator design. In it he stated that: &quot;The first space elevator would reduce lift costs immediately to $100 per pound&quot; ($220/kg).

The gravitational potential energy of any object in geosynchronous orbit (GEO), relative to Earth&#x27;s surface, is about 50 MJ (15 kWh) of energy per kilogram (see geosynchronous orbit for details). Using wholesale electricity prices for 2008 to 2009, and the current 0.5% efficiency of power beaming, a space elevator would require US$220/kg just in electrical costs. Dr. Edwards expects technical advances to increase the efficiency to 2%.

However, due to the fact that space elevators would have a limited throughput as only a few payloads could climb the tether at any one time, the launch price may be subject to market forces.

==Funding of capital costs==
According to a paper presented at the 55th International Astronautical Congress in Vancouver in October 2004, the space elevator can be considered a prestige megaproject whose current estimated cost (US$6.2 billion) is favourable compared to other megaprojects e.g. bridges, pipelines, tunnels, tall towers, high-speed rail links and maglevs. Costs are also favourable compared to that of other aerospace systems and launch vehicles.

==Total cost of a privately funded Edwards&#x27; Space Elevator==
A space elevator built according to the Edwards proposal is estimated to have total cost of about $40 billion (that figure includes $1.56 billions operational costs for first 10 years). Subsequent space elevators are estimated to cost only $14.3 billion each.

For comparison, in potentially the same time frame as the elevator:
* the Skylon, a 12,000¬†kg cargo capacity single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane (not a conventional rocket) is estimated to have an R&amp;D and production cost of about $15 billion. The vehicle has about $3,000/kg price tag. Skylon would be suitable to launch cargo &quot;and particularly&quot; people to low/medium Earth orbit (targeting maximum 30 people per flight). Early space elevator designs move only cargo but could move people as well to a much wider range of destinations. 
* Another alternative project to get large numbers of people and cargo to orbit inexpensively during this time frame is the SpaceX Starship which, like Skylon, is not a conventional rocket design as it will be fully reusable. Its cargo capacity will be between , is estimated to have an R&amp;D cost of $10 billion, and production cost of about $200-million for Starship crew, $130-million for Starship tanker and $230-million for Super Heavy. The system has a less than $140/kg price tag which is possibly as low as $47/kg. It will be capable of transporting 100 people comfortably to Mars (therefore significantly more to low/medium earth orbit).

<text>Bandelier National Monument is a United States National Monument near Los Alamos in Sandoval and Los Alamos counties, New Mexico. The monument preserves the homes and territory of the Ancestral Puebloans of a later era in the Southwest. Most of the pueblo structures date to two eras, dating between AD 1150 and 1600.

The monument is of the Pajarito Plateau, on the slopes of the Jemez volcanic field in the Jemez Mountains. Over 70% of the monument is wilderness, with over one mile of elevation change, from about along the Rio Grande to over at the peak of Cerro Grande on the rim of the Valles Caldera, providing for a wide range of life zones and wildlife habitats. of road and more than of hiking trails are built. The monument protects Ancestral Pueblo archeological sites, a diverse and scenic landscape, and the country&#x27;s largest National Park Service Civilian Conservation Corps National Landmark District. Two-thirds of the park, , is designated as the Bandelier Wilderness Area. Motorized travel and permanent structures are forbidden in the Wilderness.

Bandelier was designated by President Woodrow Wilson as a national monument on February 11, 1916, and named for Adolph Bandelier, a Swiss-American anthropologist, who researched the cultures of the area and supported preservation of the sites. The park infrastructure was developed in the 1930s by crews of the Civilian Conservation Corps and is a National Historic Landmark for its well-preserved architecture. The National Park Service cooperates with surrounding Pueblos, other federal agencies, and state agencies to manage the park.

==Geography and geology==
In October 1976, roughly 70% of the monument, , was included within the National Wilderness Preservation System. The park&#x27;s elevations range from about at the Rio Grande to over at the summit of Cerro Grande. The Valles Caldera National Preserve adjoins the monument on the north and west, extending into the Jemez Mountains.

Much of the area was covered with volcanic ash (the Bandelier Tuff) from an eruption of the Valles Caldera volcano 1.14 million years ago. The tuff overlays shales and sandstones deposited during the Permian Period and limestone of Pennsylvanian age. The volcanic outflow varied in hardness; the Ancestral Puebloans broke up the firmer materials to use as bricks, while they carved out dwellings from the softer material.

==History==
Human presence in the area has been dated to over 10,000 years before present. Permanent settlements by ancestors of the Puebloan peoples have been dated to 1150 CE; these settlers had moved closer to the Rio Grande by 1550. The distribution of basalt and obsidian artifacts from the area, along with other traded goods, rock markings, and construction techniques, indicate that its inhabitants were part of a regional trade network that included what is now Mexico. Spanish colonial settlers arrived in the 18th century. The Pueblo Jose Montoya brought Adolph Bandelier to visit the area in 1880. Looking over the cliff dwellings, Bandelier said, &quot;It is the grandest thing I ever saw.&quot;

Based on documentation and research by Bandelier, support began for preserving the area and President Woodrow Wilson signed the declaration creating the monument in 1916. Supporting infrastructure, including a lodge, was built during the 1920s and 1930s. The structures at the monument built during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps constitute the largest assembly of CCC-built structures in a national park area that has not been altered by new structures in the district. This group of 31 buildings illustrates the guiding principles of National Park Service Rustic architecture, being based on local materials and styles. It has been designated as a national landmark district.

During World War II, the monument area was closed to the public for several years, since the lodge was being used to house personnel working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos to develop an atom bomb. In 2019, Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM), announced plans to introduce legislation to redesignate Bandelier National Monument as a national park and preserve.

==Monument description==
Frijoles Canyon contains a number of ancestral pueblo homes, &quot;kivas&quot; (ceremonial structures), rock paintings, and petroglyphs. Some of the dwellings were rock structures built on the canyon floor; others were &quot;cavates&quot; produced by voids in the volcanic tuff of the canyon wall and carved out further by humans. A , predominantly paved, &quot;Main Loop Trail&quot; from the visitor center affords access to these features. A trail extending beyond this loop leads to Alcove House (formerly called Ceremonial Cave, and still so identified on some maps), a shelter cave produced by erosion of the soft rock and containing a small, reconstructed kiva that hikers may enter via ladder.


===Ancient pueblo sites===
One site of archaeological interest in the canyon is &quot;Tyuonyi&quot; (&quot;Que-weh-nee&quot;) pueblo and nearby building sites, such as Long House. Tyuonyi is a circular pueblo site that once stood one to three stories tall. Long House is adjacent to Tyounyi, built along and supported by the walls of the canyon. A reconstructed Talus House is also found along the Main Loop Trail.
These sites date from the Pueblo III Era (1150 to 1350) to the Pueblo IV Era (1350 to 1600). The age of the Tyuonyi construction has been fairly well established by the tree-ring method of dating, widely and successfully used by archeologists in the Southwest. Ceiling-beam fragments recovered from various rooms have been dated between 1383 and 1466. This general period seems to have been a time of much building in Frijoles Canyon; a score of tree-ring dates from the Rainbow House ruin, which is down the canyon a half-mile, also fall in the early and middle 15th century. Perhaps the last construction anywhere in Frijoles Canyon occurred close to 1500, with a peak of population reached near that time or shortly thereafter.

The century before Tyuonyi&#x27;s construction is thought to have been characterized by intense change and migration in the Ancestral Puebloan culture. The period of highest population density in Frijoles Canyon corresponds to a period contemporaneous with a wide-scale migration of Ancestral Puebloans away from the Four Corners area, which was suffering a deep drought, environmental stress, and social unrest in the Pueblo III period. Scholars believe that some Ancestral Puebloan groups relocated into the Rio Grande valley, southeast of their former territories, founding Tyuonyi and nearby sites. The pueblo was abandoned by 1600. The inhabitants relocated to pueblos near the Rio Grande, such as Cochiti and San Ildefonso Pueblos, which have been occupied ever since.

Other, more rustic trails enter the backcountry, which contains additional smaller archaeological sites, canyon/mesa country, and some transient waterfalls. Hikes to many of these areas are feasible and range in length from short (&lt;1 hour) excursions to multi-day backpacks. Some of the backcountry sites have been submerged, damaged, or rendered inaccessible by Cochiti Lake, a reservoir on the Rio Grande created to reduce the seasonal flooding that threatened communities and agricultural areas downstream.

A detached portion of the monument, called the Tsankawi unit, is located near the town of Los Alamos. It has some excavated sites and petroglyphs. Also at the Tsankawi unit are the remains of the home and school for indigenous people established in the late 19th century by Baroness Vera von Blumenthal and her lover Rose Dougan (or Dugan).

In the upper elevations of the monument, Nordic skiing is possible on a small network of trails reachable from New Mexico Highway 4. Not every winter produces snowfall sufficient to allow good skiing.

===Wildlife at Bandelier===
Wildlife is locally abundant, and deer and Abert&#x27;s squirrels are frequently encountered in Frijoles Canyon. Black bear and mountain lions inhabit the monument and may be encountered by the backcountry hiker. A substantial herd of elk are present during the winter months, when snowpack forces them down from their summer range in the Jemez Mountains.

Notable among the smaller mammals of the monument are large numbers of bats that seasonally inhabit shelter caves in the canyon walls, sometimes including those of Frijoles Canyon near the loop trail. Wild turkeys, vultures, ravens, several species of birds of prey, and a number of hummingbird species are common. Rattlesnakes, tarantulas, and horned lizards are occasionally seen along the trails.

==Bandelier Museum==
The visitor center at Bandelier National Monument features exhibits about the site&#x27;s inhabitants, including Ancestral Pueblo pottery, tools and artifacts of daily life. Two life-size dioramas demonstrate Pueblo life in the past and today. Also featured are contemporary Pueblo pottery pieces, 14 pastel artworks by Works Progress Administration artist Helmut Naumer Sr, and wood furniture and tinwork pieces created by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression. A 10-minute introductory film provides an overview of the monument.

==Trails==
The National Park service has noted several designated trails, advising visitors to bring adequate safe water supplies on some trails.

The &quot;Pueblo Loop Trail&quot; (previously called the &quot;Main Loop Trail&quot;) is long and loops through archeological areas, including the &quot;Big Kiva&quot;, &quot;Tyuonyi&quot;, &quot;Talus House&quot;, and &quot;Long House&quot;. It will take between 45 minutes to one hour. There are some optional ladders to allow access to the cavates (small human-carved alcoves).

Prior to the construction of the modern entrance road, the &quot;Frey Trail&quot; was the only access to the canyon. Originally, the parking lot was at the canyon rim. Today, the trail starts at the campground amphitheater. The trail is one way. There is an elevation change of .
The &quot;Alcove House&quot; trail begins at the west end of the &quot;Main Loop trail&quot; and extends to Alcove House. Previously called the &quot;Ceremonial Cave,&quot; the alcove is located above the floor of Frijoles Canyon. This pueblo was the home of around 25 Ancestral Pueblo people. Except in winter, the site is reached by four wooden ladders and stone stairs. Alcove House has a reconstructed kiva that offers views of viga holes and niches of several homes.

As of spring 2013, however, access to the kiva&#x27;s interior is closed indefinitely for safety reasons associated with stabilization of the structure. Ladders and stairs have been reopened to public use.

The &quot;Falls Trail&quot; starts at the east end of the Backcountry Parking Lot (adjacent to the Cottonwood Picnic Area). Over its , it descends , passing two waterfalls and ending at the Rio Grande. But, trail damage resulting from the 2011 Las Conchas Fire has led to the indefinite, and possibly permanent, closure of the trail beyond Upper Frijoles Falls, pending remediation. In addition to the elevation change, the trail&#x27;s challenges include steep dropoffs at many places along the trail and a lack of bridges over Frijoles Creek. These continue to factors on the portion of the trail that is open.

The &quot;Frijolito Loop Trail&quot; is more strenuous. It starts in the Cottonwood Picnic Area and climbs out of Frijoles Canyon using a switchback path. Once on top of the mesa, it passes &quot;Frijolito Pueblo&quot;. It returns to the visitor center along the &quot;Long Trail&quot;.

Additional backcountry trails extend into the designated wilderness of the monument, crossing Alamo and Capulin Canyons and connecting with the Dome Trailhead on the Santa Fe National Forest. As there is much less visitor use of these trails, trail conditions can vary. This backcountry system was designated as a National Recreation Trail in 1982.

==Gallery==
==National Park Service Rustic style==
Bandelier has excellent examples of CCC-constructed National Park Service Rustic style of architecture, built during the Great Depression by work crews while the area was managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The Bandelier CCC camp employed several thousand men from 1933 to 1941 as a New Deal works project, and built roads, trails, and park buildings and other amenities. In 1943, camp provided temporary housing for scientists, technicians, and their families involved in the secret Manhattan Project at nearby Los Alamos. Construction contractors were housed there in early 1944.

The park&#x27;s service area was designed to resemble a traditional Pueblo village. Most of the CCC-built buildings are set around a wooded plaza at the end of the main access road (also a CCC construction), and were designed to house the monument staff, provide accommodations and services for visitors, and included maintenance areas. These historic structures include the Frey Lodge (park headquarters); the guest cabins (employee housing), the gift shop, and the park visitor center. The CCC crews also built furniture for these facilities, and artists paid by the Federal Arts Project provided artwork. The preserved elements of the CCC construction were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

<doc id="683441" wikidata="Q810498" url="?curid=683441" title="Bassenthwaite Lake">
<text>Bassenthwaite Lake is a body of water in the Lake District in North West England, near the town of Keswick. It has an area of , making the fourth largest of the lakes in the region. The lake has a length of approximately long and maximum width of , a maximum depth of , and a surface elevation of above sea level. Its primary inflow and outflow is the River Derwent, which drains into the Irish Sea at Workington. The lake is in the unitary authority of Cumberland, and the ceremonial county of Cumbria.

Bassenthwaite Lake is the only body of water in the Lake District to use the word &#x27;lake&#x27; in its name, all the others using the local terms &#x27;water&#x27; (e.g. Derwentwater), &#x27;mere&#x27; (e.g. Windermere) or &quot;&quot;&#x27;tarn&#x27; (e.g. Dock Tarn). Some maps dating from the 18th century do in fact mark this lake with the name &quot;Bassenwater&quot;, and the use of the name &quot;Broadwater&quot; for this lake is also attested.

The A66 dual carriageway runs roughly north‚Äìsouth along the western side of the lake. The lay-bys are popular spots for photographers and bird watchers looking for osprey. The section running south towards Keswick was built along the course of the former Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith railway line.

==Origin==
Like the other Lake District lakes, Bassenthwaite Lake lies in a glacially eroded valley, left after the last glaciation. Bassenthwaite Lake is linked to Derwent Water by the River Derwent, which crosses the alluvial plain between the two lakes. There has been speculation that Derwent Water and Bassenthwaite Lake were once one larger lake with the alluvial flats now separating them formed from partial infill of the original basin.

==Etymology==
The lake takes its name from the village of Bassenthwaite, meaning &quot;Bastun&#x27;s clearing&quot;. &quot;Bastun&quot; is usually taken to be an Anglo-French nickname or surname originally meaning &quot;stick&quot;, while &quot;thwaite&quot; is from Old Norse &quot;√æveit&quot; (&quot;clearing&quot;). The lake was also formerly known as &quot;Bastun&#x27;s water&quot;.

==Biodiversity==
The lake&#x27;s catchment is the largest of any lake in the Lake District. This, along with a large percentage of cultivable land within this drainage area, makes Bassenthwaite Lake a fertile habitat.

The lake contains salmon, trout, pike, perch, minnow, dace, ruffe and eel, though the predominant species is roach. Also present was the vendace, until it was declared extinct within the lake in 2001.

===Birdlife===
Cormorants have been known to fish the lake and herons can also be seen; at the turn of the 19th century there was a report of 60 nests in a heronry in nearby Wythop Woods.

====Lake District Osprey Project====
In 2001, ospreys returned to nest in the Lake District after more than a hundred years. They nested by the lake, and have done so regularly since. The osprey family can be watched from viewpoints at Dodd Wood and by CCTV from Whinlatter Forest Visitor Centre.

==Threats==
Water quality is adversely affected by high sediment deposition, and there are other problems such as phosphate pollution. These issues are being addressed via the Bassenthwaite Lake Restoration Programme.
To reduce the sediment entering the lake more trees have been planted alongside watercourses, and clear felling of existing tree cover has been discouraged with the cooperation of Forestry England.

Phosphates encourage algae formation.
The Environment Agency attributed unacceptable levels of phosphate in the catchment to Keswick wastewater treatment works, Greta Grove pumping station and the associated overflow.
Water company United Utilities was fined ¬£27,000 in 2011 for allowing raw sewage to pollute nearby Pow Beck watercourse. The company&#x27;s sewer improvement scheme, begun in 2011, aims to improve water quality in the River Greta and the lake itself. The project will facilitate removal of greater quantities of phosphates. Works to upgrade the wastewater treatment works and pumping station were begun in May 2010.

==Neolithic era==
It has been reported that the wide gravel spreads between Derwent Water and Bassenthwaite Lake provided the best centre within Lakeland for Neolithic farming communities. Stone axes have been found in the area and particularly at Mossgarth, Portinscale.

<text>Erasmo Ramirez (born April 29, 1976) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers, Oakland Athletics, and Florida Marlins.

==Biography==
Ramirez, a first-generation Mexican American, played high school baseball for Saddleback High School in Santa Ana, California, and college baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans. The San Francisco Giants drafted Ramirez in the 11th round (338th overall pick) in the 1998 MLB draft. He spent seasons with the Giants organization before being traded with Todd Ozias and Chris Magruder for Andr√©s Galarraga on July 24, 2001.

;Texas Rangers
Ramirez made his major league debut with the Texas Rangers in 2003. That season, he compiled a 3‚Äì1 record with a 3.86 ERA and 28 strikeouts in 49 innings pitched and allowed just 9 walks. He played parts of 2004 and 2005 in MLB with the Rangers.

In 2006, after the Rangers had signed more relievers, Ramirez was optioned to the Oklahoma Redhawks, their Pacific Coast League Triple-A affiliate. Ramirez spent the entire 2006 season with the Redhawks and then became a free agent.

;Oakland Athletics
On November 20, 2006, the Oakland Athletics signed Ramirez to a minor league contract. He began the 2007 season with their Triple-A affiliate, the Sacramento River Cats, and was promoted to the major league club on May 25. Ramirez played three games for the Athletics; he also had an 18-day stretch during which he did not play at all. Ramirez was designated for assignment by the Athletics on June 16, 2007, and became a free agent.

;Florida Marlins
The Florida Marlins signed Ramirez on June 20, 2007, and assigned him to Triple-A Albuquerque of the Pacific Coast League. On July 2, 2007, Ramirez had his contract purchased by the Marlins and he returned to the major leagues. He played just four games for the Marlins and was designated for assignment on July 13, 2007, and was outrighted to Triple-A five days later.

Ramirez signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers in January 2008, and played for their Triple-A team, the Nashville Sounds, during the 2008 season. He became a free agent after the season and signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox, but did not play for any of their farm teams.

Ramirez had excellent control of his pitches and did not walk many batters. He walked just 1.74 batters per 9 innings in 114 major league innings.

<doc id="683449" wikidata="Q1973568" url="?curid=683449" title="Ullswater">
<text>Ullswater is a glacial lake in Cumbria, England and part of the Lake District National Park. It is the second largest lake in the region by both area and volume, after Windermere. The lake is about long, wide, and has a maximum depth of . Its outflow is River Eamont, which meets the River Eden at Brougham Castle before flowing into the Solway Firth. The lake is in the administrative county of Westmorland and Furness and the ceremonial county of Cumbria.

==Geography==
It is a typical Lake District &quot;ribbon lake&quot;, formed after the last ice age by a glacier scooping out the valley floor, which then filled with meltwater. Ullswater was formed by three glaciers. Surrounding hills give it the shape of an extenuated &quot;Z&quot; with three segments or reaches winding through them. For much of its length, Ullswater formed the border between the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Ullswater is uncertain. Whaley suggests &quot;Ulf&#x27;s lake&quot;, from Old Norse personal name Ulfr plus Middle English water, influenced in usage by the Old Norse &quot;vatn&quot; (water or lake). &quot;Ulfr&quot; is also the Old Norse noun meaning wolf, and Hutchinson thought that the name might refer to the lake as a resort of wolves, or to its elbow-shaped bend (citing a Celtic &quot;ulle&quot;).&quot;

Some say it comes from the name of a Nordic chief named Ulf, who ruled over the area. There was also a Saxon Lord of Greystoke called Ulphus, whose land bordered the lake. The lake may have been named Ulf&#x27;s Water in honour of either of these, or after the Norse god Ullr. Hodgson Hill, an earthwork on the north-east shoreline of Ullswater may be the remains of a Viking fortified settlement.

==Settlements==
Glenridding, is situated at the southern end of the lake, Pooley Bridge is at the northern end, other villages situated on Ullswater include Howtown, Sandwick and Watermillock.

Ullswater is overlooked by Dunmallard Hill, which was the site of an Iron Age fort, on the western side of the lake is the Aira Force waterfall.

==Activities==
The lake has been a tourist destination since the mid-18th century. By the 1890s, Ullswater had become a fashionable holiday destination for the British aristocracy, thanks to its good sailing conditions and proximity to fell shooting estates. In 1912, Wilhelm II, German Emperor visited Ullswater and toured the lake on the MY &quot;Raven&quot;, which was re-fitted to act as a royal yacht. A shooting lodge (The Bungalow) was constructed for the Kaiser at Martindale by the major local landowner, Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale.

Ullswater&#x27;s attractions include the Ullswater &quot;Steamers&quot; which offer trips around the lake calling at Pooley Bridge, Glenridding, Howtown and Aira Force. These sail all the year round and were originally working boats which from the 1850s moved mail, workers and goods to and from the Greenside Mine at Glenridding, which closed in 1962. 

A walking route the Ullswater Way was officially opened in 2016 by writer and broadcaster Eric Robson. The route can be walked in either direction and from any starting point. 

Ullswater is also a sailing location with several marinas round the lake. It is home to the Ullswater Yacht Club and the Lord Birkett Memorial Trophy, held annually on the first weekend in July. This regularly attracts over 200 sailing boats for two races covering the length of the lake. There are also facilities for diving, rowing and motorboats. Another of attraction is the waterfall of Aira Force, midway along the lake on the western side. Ullswater lies partly within the National Trust&#x27;s Ullswater and Aira Force property. Close to the falls is Lyulph&#x27;s Tower, a pele tower or castellated building built by a former Duke of Norfolk as a shooting box. The Sharrow Bay Country House hotel stands on the lake&#x27;s eastern shore.

Donald Campbell set the world water speed record on Ullswater on 23 July 1955, when he piloted the jet-propelled hydroplane &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; to a speed of 202.32¬†mph (325.53¬†km/h).

Ullswater Lake is a popular tourist destination containing many campsites, static caravan parks, and holiday parks. The rural setting gives plenty of space for pitching tents as well as woodland shelter and screening. 

== Ullswater geese deaths ==
In 2022 greylag geese on the lake were seen to be dragged underwater by several witnesses on different occasions. The cause is unknown, though there was speculation that a large pike, a wels catfish or an otter was responsible. Dr Roger Sweeting, of the Freshwater Biological Association, also suggested that the birds could have become entangled in discarded fishing line and had become exhausted, losing their stability.

==Notable people==
Just south of Pooley Bridge on the lake&#x27;s eastern shore is &quot;Eusemere&quot;, where anti-slavery campaigner Thomas Clarkson (1760‚Äì1846) lived; the house gives one of the best views of the lower reach of Ullswater. William and Dorothy Wordsworth were friends of Clarkson and visited on many occasions. After visiting Clarkson in April 1802, Wordsworth was inspired to write his famous poem &quot;Daffodils&quot; after seeing daffodils growing on the shores of Ullswater on his journey back to Grasmere. Wordsworth once wrote of &quot;Ullswater, as being, perhaps, upon the whole, the happiest combination of beauty and grandeur, which any of the Lakes affords&quot;.

The politician William Marshall lived on the Ullswater shore at Watermillock. His descendants, the diplomat Sir Cecil Spring Rice and his brother Stephen Spring Rice, were brought up there. Nearby Aira Force has several memorials to members of the Spring family.

In 1962 Lord Birkett led a campaign to prevent Ullswater from becoming a reservoir. He died one day after the proposition was defeated in the House of Lords and he is commemorated with a plaque on Kailpot Crag. The Birkett Regatta, held each year in early July, involves a two-day round-the-island race in Birkett&#x27;s memory, 2018 was the 60th anniversary of the event, with Lord Birkett&#x27;s granddaughter in attendance.

<text>}}
In September 1970, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked four airliners bound for New York City and one for London. Three aircraft were forced to land at Dawson&#x27;s Field, a remote desert airstrip near Zarqa, Jordan, formerly Royal Air Force Station Zarqa, which then became PFLP&#x27;s &quot;Revolutionary Airport&quot;. By the end of the incident, one hijacker had been killed and one injury reported. This was the second instance of mass aircraft hijacking, after an escape from communist Czechoslovakia in 1950.

On 6 September, TWA Flight 741 from Frankfurt (a Boeing 707) and Swissair Flight 100 from Z√ºrich (a Douglas DC-8) were forced to land at Dawson&#x27;s Field. On the same day, the hijacking of El Al Flight¬†219 from Amsterdam (another 707) was foiled: hijacker Patrick Arg√ºello was shot and killed, and his partner Leila Khaled was subdued and handed over to British authorities in London. Two PFLP hijackers, who were prevented from boarding the El Al flight, hijacked instead Pan Am Flight¬†93, a Boeing 747, diverting the large aircraft first to Beirut and then to Cairo, rather than to the small Jordanian airstrip. On 9 September, a fifth aircraft, BOAC Flight 775, a Vickers VC10 coming from Bahrain, was hijacked by a PFLP sympathizer and taken to Dawson&#x27;s Field in order to pressure the British to free Khaled.

While the majority of the 310 hostages were transferred to Amman and freed on 11 September, the PFLP segregated the flight crews and Jewish passengers, keeping the 56 Jewish hostages in custody, while releasing the non-Jews. Six hostages in particular were kept because they were men and American citizens, not necessarily Jews: Robert Norman Schwartz, a U.S. Defense Department researcher stationed in Thailand; James Lee Woods, Schwartz&#x27;s assistant and security detail; Gerald Berkowitz, an American-born Jew and college chemistry professor; Rabbi Avraham Harari-Raful and his brother Rabbi Yosef Harari-Raful, two Sephardi Brooklyn school teachers; and John Hollingsworth, a U.S. State Department employee. Schwartz, whose father was Jewish, was a convert to Catholicism. On 12 September, prior to their announced deadline, the PFLP used explosives to destroy the empty planes, as they anticipated a counterstrike.

The PFLP&#x27;s exploitation of Jordanian territory was an example of the increasingly autonomous Arab Palestinian activity within the Kingdom of Jordan¬†‚Äì a serious challenge to the Hashemite monarchy of King Hussein. Hussein declared martial law on 16 September and from 17 to 27 September his forces deployed into Palestinian-controlled areas in what became known as Black September in Jordan, nearly triggering a regional war involving Syria, Iraq, and Israel.

A swift Jordanian victory, however, enabled a 30 September deal in which the remaining PFLP hostages were released in exchange for Khaled and three PFLP members in a Swiss prison.

==Hijackings==

===El Al Flight 219===
El Al Flight 219, a Boeing 707-458 registered as with serial number 18071, originated in Tel Aviv, Israel, and was headed to New York City. It had 138 passengers and 10 crew members aboard. It stopped in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and was hijacked shortly after it took off from there by Patrick Arg√ºello, a Nicaraguan American, and Leila Khaled, a Palestinian.

The original plan was to have four hijackers aboard this flight, but two were prevented from boarding in Amsterdam by Israeli security‚Äîthese two conspirators, traveling under Senegalese passports with consecutive numbers, were prevented from flying on El Al on 6 September. They purchased first-class tickets on Pan Am Flight 93 and hijacked that flight instead.

Posing as a married couple, Arg√ºello and Khaled boarded the plane using Honduran passports‚Äîhaving passed through a security check of their luggage‚Äîand were seated in the second row of tourist class. Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, in an interview in 2000,So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when we crossed the first class, people were shouting but I didn&#x27;t see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me &quot;go forward I protect your back.&quot; So I went and then he found a hostess and she was going to catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. So I was screaming &quot;open the door.&quot; Then the hostess came; she said &quot;she has two hand grenades,&quot; but they did not open (the cockpit door) and suddenly I was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying &quot;I will count and if you don&#x27;t open I will blow up the plane.&quot;

After being informed by intercom that a hijacking was in progress, Captain Uri Bar-Lev (39), decided not to accede to their demands:I decided that we were not going to be hijacked. The security guy was sitting here ready to jump. I told him that I was going to put the plane into negative-G mode. Everyone would fall. When you put the plane into negative, it&#x27;s like being in a falling elevator. Instead of the plane flying this way, it dives and everyone who is standing falls down.

Bar Lev put the plane into a steep nosedive which threw the two hijackers off-balance. Arg√ºello reportedly threw his sole grenade down the airliner aisle, but it failed to explode, and he was hit over the head with a bottle of whiskey by a passenger after he drew his pistol. Arg√ºello shot steward Shlomo Vider and according to the passengers and Israeli security personnel, was then shot by a sky marshal. His accomplice Khaled was subdued by security and passengers, while the plane made an emergency landing at London Heathrow Airport; she then claimed that Arg√ºello was shot four times in the back after he and Khaled failed to hijack the airplane. Vider underwent emergency surgery and recovered from his wounds; Arg√ºello died in the ambulance taking both him and Khaled to Hillingdon Hospital. Khaled was then arrested by British police.

===TWA Flight 741===
Trans World Airlines Flight 741, a Boeing 707-331B registered as with serial number 18917, was a round-the-world flight carrying 144 passengers and a crew of 11. The flight on this day was flying from Tel Aviv to Athens, Frankfurt am Main, West Germany, and then to New York City, and was hijacked over Belgium on the Frankfurt-New York leg. It was crewed by Captain Carroll D. Woods, First Officer Jim Majer and Flight Engineer Al Kiburis.

Flight 741&#x27;s purser, Rudi Swinkles, recalled seeing a passenger running toward first class. Assuming it was an angry husband chasing his wife, Swinkles ran after him. The hijackers were at the cockpit door, ordering a flight attendant to open the door. The male hijacker turned around, pointing a nickel-plated .38 revolver and a hand grenade at Swinkles and yelled &quot;Get back! Get back!&quot; Swinkles dove behind the bulkhead first class divider.

Hijackers gained control of the cockpit. The male hijacker kept his revolver pointed at Majer until the plane landed at Dawson&#x27;s Field, saying &quot;I want you to turn this plane around.&quot; The female hijacker stated on the intercom, &quot;This is your new captain speaking. This flight has been taken over by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. We will take you to a friendly country with friendly people.&quot; The female hijacker also ordered everyone in first class to move back to coach.

It landed at Dawson&#x27;s Field in Jordan at 6:45¬†p.m. local time.

Yitzchak Hutner was one of the passengers.

Martha Hodes, an American then 12 who was on this flight with her 13-year-old sister, published her account of the hijacking in 2023. Her book is entitled &quot;My Hijacking&quot;.

===Swissair Flight 100===
Swissair Flight 100, a Douglas DC-8-53 registered as HB-IDD and serial number 45656, named &quot;Nidwalden&quot;, built in 1963, was carrying 145 passengers and 12 crew members from Z√ºrich-Kloten Airport, Switzerland, to John F. Kennedy International Airport, United States. The aircraft was hijacked over France minutes after the TWA flight. A male and a female seized the plane, one of them carrying a silver revolver. An announcement was made over the intercom that the plane had been taken over by the PFLP as it was diverted to Dawson&#x27;s Field, increasing the hostage number to 306 hostages.

When all the non-Israeli and non-Jewish passengers and crew were released, First Officer Horst Jerosch remained as a captive.

====Nationalities on Flight 100====


===Pan Am Flight 93===
Pan Am Flight 93, a Boeing 747-121 registered as with serial number 19656, named &quot;Clipper Fortune,&quot; was carrying 152 passengers and 17 crew, of which 85 were US citizens. The flight originated from Brussels, Belgium, to New York, with a stopover in Amsterdam. The two hijackers bumped from the El Al flight boarded and hijacked this flight as a target of opportunity.

Flight director John Ferruggio recalled, We were ready for take off in Amsterdam, and the aircraft came to an abrupt stop in the middle of the runway. And Captain Priddy called me up into the cockpit and says, &quot;I&#x27;d like to have a word with you.&quot; I went up to the cockpit, and he says, &quot;We have two passengers by the name of Diop and Gueye.&quot; He says, &quot;Go down and try to find them in the manifest, because I would like to have a word with them.&quot; ... So Captain Priddy sat them down at these two seats over here. He gave them a pretty good pat. They had a Styrofoam container in their groin area where they carried the grenade, and the 25-Cal. pistols. But this we found out much later.

The plane first landed in Beirut, where it refueled and picked up several associates of the hijackers, along with enough explosives to destroy the entire plane. It then landed in Cairo after uncertainty whether the Dawson&#x27;s Field airport could handle the size of the new Boeing 747 jumbo jet. Flight director John Ferruggio, who led the plane&#x27;s evacuation, is credited with saving the plane&#x27;s passengers and crew. The plane was blown up at Cairo seconds after it had been evacuated. This was the first hull loss of a Boeing 747. An audio recording of Feruggio&#x27;s landing instructions to passengers was made by one of them and can be heard in a National Public Radio report. The hijackers were arrested by Egyptian police.

===BOAC Flight 775===
On 9 September, a fifth plane, BOAC Flight 775, a Vickers VC-10 registered as flying from Bombay (now Mumbai) to London via Bahrain and Beirut was hijacked after departing Bahrain and forcibly landed at Dawson&#x27;s Field. This was the work of a PFLP sympathizer who wanted to influence the British government to free Leila Khaled.

Footage of the plane taking off from Beirut for Dawson&#x27;s Field is in the Pathe News archive.

==Hostage accounts==

Unnamed passengers later recounted their days as hostages.

Unknown speaker 1: &quot;I was held hostage in the front of the plane by the Arabs. They wouldn&#x27;t believe that I was an American citizen, because they saw my passport that I was in Israel two weeks before. They thought I was connected with the Israeli military, and I was held at gunpoint in front of the plane.&quot;

Unknown speaker 2: &quot;Well, then they were told that we were being hijacked to Beirut, which we, we originally were, and everyone was to remain calm and do exactly what they said.&quot;

Unknown speaker 3: &quot;I landed at the airport, we got off, and they told the captain that we had three minutes to evacuate; but I didn&#x27;t think there were still a couple of people on board when they blew the, they blew the front part of the plane up. They had dynamite all over the front and the back of the plane. They brought on 20 kilos of plastic dynamite or something in Beirut.&quot;

==Days in the desert==
On 7 September 1970, the hijackers held a press conference for 60 members of the media who had made their way to what was being called &quot;Revolution Airport&quot;. About 125 hostages were transferred to Amman, while the American, Israeli, Swiss, and West German citizens were held on the planes. Jewish passengers were also held. Passenger Rivke Berkowitz of New York, interviewed in 2006, recalled &quot;the hijackers went around asking people their religion, and I said I was Jewish.&quot; Another Jewish hostage, 16-year-old Barbara Mensch (sister of Peter Mensch and sister-in-law of former UK MP Louise Mensch), was told she was &quot;a political prisoner.&quot;

As groups of the remaining passengers and crew were assembled on the sand in front of the media, members of the PFLP, among them Bassam Abu Sharif, made statements to the press. Sharif claimed that the goal of the hijackings was &quot;to gain the release of all of our political prisoners jailed in Israel in exchange for the hostages.&quot;

In the United States, President Richard Nixon met with his advisers on 8 September and ordered United States Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird to bomb the PFLP positions in Jordan. Laird refused on the pretext that the weather was unfavorable, and the idea was dropped. The 82nd Airborne Division was put on alert, the Sixth Fleet was put to sea, and military aircraft were sent to Turkey in preparation for a possible military strike.
In contrast, British Prime Minister Edward Heath decided to negotiate with the hijackers, ultimately agreeing to release Khaled and others in exchange for hostages. This was bitterly opposed by the United States:Tensions between London and Washington are reflected in a bitterly acrimonious telephone conversation between top Foreign Office official Sir Denis Greenhill and senior White House aide Joseph Sisco. ... &quot;I think your government would want to weigh very, very carefully the kind of outcry that would occur in this country against your taking this kind of action.&quot; Greenhill replied: &quot;Well, they do, Joe, but there is also an outcry in this country,&quot; expressing concern that &quot;Israel won&#x27;t lift a bloody finger and ... our people get killed. You could imagine how bad that would look, and if it all comes out that we could have got our people out but for the obduracy of you and other people so to speak. ... I mean people say, why the bloody hell didn&#x27;t you try?&quot;

On 9 September the United Nations Security Council demanded the release of the passengers, in Resolution 286. The following day, fighting between the PFLP and Jordanian forces erupted in Amman at the Intercontinental Hotel, where the 125 women and children were being kept by the PFLP, and the Kingdom appeared to be on the brink of full-scale civil war. The destruction of the aircraft on 12 September highlighted the impotence of the Jordanian government in Palestinian-controlled areas, and the Palestinians declared the city of Irbid to be &quot;liberated territory&quot;, in a direct challenge to Hussein&#x27;s rule.

On 13 September the BBC World Service broadcast a government announcement in Arabic saying that the UK would release Khaled in exchange for the hostages.

According to United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, &quot;At this point, whether because [American] readiness measures had given [King Hussein] a psychological lift or because he was reaching the point of desperation, Hussein resolved on an all-out confrontation with the fedayeen.&quot;

Complicating the international crisis was the fact that Syria and Iraq, which had links with the USSR, had already threatened to intervene on behalf of Palestinian groups in any confrontation with the Kingdom of Jordan. According to British documents declassified under the &quot;thirty year rule&quot;, an anxious King Hussein asked the UK and United States to pass a request to Israel to bomb Syrian troops if they entered Jordan in support of the Palestinians. When a Syrian tank crossed the border, Israeli aircraft overflew the area in warning.

==Resolution and consequences==
King Hussein declared martial law on 16 September and initiated the military actions later known as the Black September conflict. Hostage David Raab described the Jordanian military actions: We were in the middle of the shelling since Ashrafiyeh [neighbourhood in Amman] was among the Jordanian Army&#x27;s primary targets. Electricity was cut off, and again we had little food or water. Friday afternoon, we heard the metal tracks of a tank clanking on the pavement. We were quickly herded into one room, and the guerrillas threw open the doors to make the building appear abandoned so it wouldn&#x27;t attract fire. Suddenly, the shelling stopped.

About two weeks after the start of the crisis, the remaining hostages were recovered from locations around Amman and exchanged for Leila Khaled and several other PFLP prisoners. The hostages were flown to Cyprus and then to Rome&#x27;s Leonardo da Vinci Airport, where on 28 September they met President Nixon, who was conducting a State visit to Italy and the Vatican. Speaking to reporters that day, Nixon noted he had told the released captives that: ... as a result of what they had been through... the possibility of reducing hijackings in the future had been substantially increased, because the international community was outraged by these incidents. Now we have not only mobilized guards on our planes, but we are developing facilities ... for the purpose of seeing that people who might be potential hijackers do not get on planes with weapons or explosive material.

During the crisis, on 11 September President Nixon initiated a program to address the problem of &quot;air piracy&quot;, including the immediate launch of a group of 100 federal agents to begin serving as armed sky marshals on U.S. flights. Nixon&#x27;s statement further indicated the U.S. departments of Defense and Transportation would determine whether X-ray devices then available to the military could be moved into civilian service.

The PFLP officially disavowed the tactic of airline hijackings several years later, although several of its members and subgroups continued to hijack aircraft and commit other violent operations.

==Documentary film==
In 2006, Ilan Ziv described the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings in &quot;Hijacked&quot;, an hour-long episode of PBS&#x27;s program &quot;American Experience&quot;, which he wrote and directed and which originally aired on 26 February 2006. Ziv included archival footage of the events and interviewed hijackers, hostages, members of the media, and politicians.

<text>Sidney Hillman (March 23, 1887 ‚Äì July 10, 1946) was an American labor leader. He was the head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and was a key figure in the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and in marshaling labor&#x27;s support for President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal coalition of the Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Sidney Hillman was born in ≈Ωagarƒó, Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire, on March 23, 1887, the son of Lithuanian Jewish parents. Sidney&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a small-scale merchant; his paternal grandfather was a rabbi known for his piety and lack of concern for material possessions. Hillman&#x27;s father was himself an impoverished merchant, more concerned with reading and prayer than with his faltering business.

From a young age Sidney had shown great academic promise, mastering the rote memorization upon which the &quot;cheder&quot; education of the day was based. By the age of 13, Hillman had memorized several volumes of the Talmud. The next year he was chosen by the Hillman rabbinical clan to go away to attend &quot;yeshiva&quot; in Vilijampolƒó, a small town across the river from the city of Kaunas. It was hoped that Sidney would follow in the Hillman family tradition by becoming a rabbi.

Things did not proceed as planned, however. While in Slobodka, Hillman began to regularly attend the secret meetings of an illegal study circle headed by a local druggist. The study circle&#x27;s members read radical literature and books on political economy, and Hillman was here exposed to the works of Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer in Russian translation.

==Career==

===Early career===

====Russia====

Early in 1903, Hillman passed from the training grounds of the Marxist study circle to fully fledged membership in the Bund, a revolutionary socialist union of Jewish workers within the Pale in conflict with the Tsarist authorities. Hillman became a leading activist in the Bund, leading the first May Day march ever conducted by the organization through the streets of Kovno in 1904. Hillman was arrested shortly thereafter for his revolutionary activities and sat in prison for several months, where he learned more about revolutionary social theory from fellow prisoners.

By 1905 Hillman ‚Äî along with many others in the Bund ‚Äî had come to identify himself with the Menshevik wing of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP), identifying in particular with the internationalism of Julius Martov. Hillman played only a minor local role during the Russian Revolution of 1905, engaging in the distribution of leaflets, raising funds for the revolutionary organization, and informally speaking on the streets to groups of workers.

====Great Britain====

In 1906, Tsarist repression in the form of police raids and organized pogroms forced the Russian socialist movement back underground. Hillman joined the exodus of revolutionaries from the country in October 1906, traveling under a false passport through Germany to Manchester, England, where he joined his uncle, a prosperous furniture dealer, and two brothers already living there.

====Chicago====

In the summer of 1907, Hillman emigrated once again, this time setting out for America aboard the White Star liner &quot;Cedric,&quot; arriving in New York City on August 8. Hillman&#x27;s prospects were poor in New York and he soon set out for Chicago, where a friend and a more favorable job market awaited him.

In Chicago, Hillman worked briefly picking orders in a warehouse for $6 a week. He then found a slightly better-paying job as a clerk in the infants&#x27; wear department of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Hillman remained in that position for nearly two years before being fired in the spring of 1909 during a downturn of business.

The unemployed Hillman found work in the garment industry as an apprentice garment cutter for Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx, a prominent manufacturer of men&#x27;s clothing. It would prove to be Hillman&#x27;s last job as a worker at the bench.

=== Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union===
====Formation====

When a spontaneous strike by a handful of women workers there led to a citywide strike of 45,000 garment workers in 1910, Hillman was a rank-and-file leader in the strike. That strike was a bitter one and pitted the strikers against not only their employers and the local authorities, but also their own union, the United Garment Workers, a conservative AFL affiliate. When the UGW accepted an inadequate settlement, the membership rejected the offer and continued the strike, winning some gains at Hart, Schaffner. Hillman became a business agent for the new local.

The leadership of the international union mistrusted the more militant local leadership in Chicago and in other large urban locals, which had strong Socialist loyalties. When it tried to disenfranchise those locals&#x27; members at the UGW&#x27;s 1914 convention, those locals, representing two thirds of the union&#x27;s membership, bolted to form the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.

Hillman had taken the position of Chief Clerk within the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union in New York in early 1914. He found that job, in which he tried to maintain the stability imposed on a ferociously competitive industry by the Protocols of Peace, and in which the internal rivalries within the union threatened to flare up into all-out conflict, frustrating. When the insurgents who had walked out of the UGW convention to form the Amalgamated sent him a telegram imploring him to accept the Presidency, followed by another telegram from Bessie Abramowitz (b.1889). She was one of the original leaders of the 1910 strike, an important figure in union politics and his fianc√©e. Hillman accepted and left the ILG after less than a year.

Hillman knew the risks he was taking. The AFL refused to recognize the new union and the UGW regularly raided it, furnishing strikebreakers and signing contracts with struck employers, in the years to come. He helped the Amalgamated solidify its gains and extend its power in Chicago through a series of strikes in the last half of the 1910s and to extend the union&#x27;s membership into important garment centers in Baltimore and Rochester, New York, where the union had to overcome divisions within garment workers on ethnic lines and the opposition of the Industrial Workers of the World. Manning ramparts for Hillman in Rochester was Paul Blanshard.

The ACWA also benefited from the relatively pro-union stance of the federal government during World War I, during which the federal Board of Control and Labor Standards for Army Clothing enforced a policy of labor peace in return for union recognition. Hillman was particularly receptive to the opportunities that government intervention in labor relations presented the union; he not only did not have the ingrained distrust of governmental regulation that now marked Samuel Gompers and other leaders of the AFL, but had a firm belief in the sort of industrial democracy in which government helped mediate between labor and management. The government&#x27;s interest in maintaining production and avoiding disruptive strikes helped the Amalgamated organize non-union outposts such as Rochester and control the cutthroat competition that had prevailed in the industry for decades.

That policy ended in 1919, when employers in nearly every industry with a history of unionism went on the offensive. The ACWA not only survived a four-month lockout in New York City in 1919, but came away in an even stronger position. By 1920, the union had contracts with 85 percent of men&#x27;s garment manufacturers in the city and had reduced the workweek to 44 hours.

====Social unionism and economic rationalization====

The ACWA pioneered a version of &quot;social unionism&quot; in the 1920s that offered low-cost cooperative housing and unemployment insurance to union members and founded a bank (Amalgamated Bank) that would serve labor&#x27;s interests. Hillman had strong ties to many progressive reformers, such as Jane Addams and Clarence Darrow, who had assisted the Amalgamated in its early strikes in Chicago in 1910 and New York in 1913. While other unions, notably the railroad brotherhoods and building trades unions within the AFL also founded banks of their own, the Amalgamated also used its banks to supervise the business operations of those garment businesses that came to it for loans.

Under Hillman&#x27;s leadership, the union tried to moderate the fierce competition between employers in the industry by imposing industry wide working standards, thereby taking wages and hours out of the competitive calculus. The ACWA tried to regulate the industry in other ways, arranging loans and conducting efficiency studies for financially troubled employers. Hillman also favored &quot;constructive cooperation&quot; with employers, relying on arbitration rather than strikes to resolve disputes during the life of a contract. As Hillman explained his philosophy in 1938:

:Certainly, I believe in collaborating with the employers! That is what unions are for. I even believe in helping an employer function more productively. For then, we will have a claim to higher wages, shorter hours, and greater participation in the benefits of running a smooth industrial machine...

Hillman&#x27;s belief in stability as the basis for progress was linked with a willingness to embrace industrial engineering approaches, such as Taylorism, that sought to rationalize the work processes as well. This put Hillman and the ACW leadership at odds with the strong anarcho-syndicalist tendencies within the union&#x27;s membership, many of whom believed in direct action as a principle as well as tactic.

====Bolshevism====
On the other hand, it made Hillman receptive in the early 1920s to the Soviet Union&#x27;s reconstruction efforts, particularly during its New Economic Policy phase. Hillman led the union into a joint business project with the Soviet Union that brought western technology and principles of industrial management to ten clothing factories in the Soviet Union.

The mechanism for this interaction was the Russian-American Industrial Corporation (RAIC) at 31 Union Square, New York City, launched by Hillman with Max Lowenthal as his attorney. Both Hillman and Lowenthal were also among the original directors of the Amalgamated Bank of New York, as advertised in the &quot;Liberator&quot; magazine. The ad mentions that the bank is owned and operated by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. It lists chairman Hyman Blumberg, president R. L. Redheffer, vice president Jacob S. Potofsky, cashier Leroy Peterson, and directors including Sidney Hillman, August Bellanca, Fiorello H. La Guardia, Joseph Schlossberg, and Max Zaritsky.

Hillman&#x27;s support for the Soviet experiment won him the enthusiastic support of the Communist Party USA in the early 1920s; it also further alienated him from those in the Socialist Party and associated with the Daily Forward under the leadership of Abraham Cahan, with whom Hillman and the Amalgamated already had strained relations. While Hillman&#x27;s relationship with the Communist Party ultimately broke up in the conflict over whether to support Robert La Follette, Sr.&#x27;s candidacy for President on the Progressive Party ticket in 1924, Hillman never faced the sort of volcanic upsurge that nearly tore apart the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union during this period and never undertook the wholesale purges that David Dubinsky and other leaders of the ILGWU used to stay in power. By the end of the decade, after fighting and losing battles in Montreal, Toronto and Rochester, the CP was no longer a significant force in the union.

====Fighting organized crime====
While battling the CP, Hillman turned a blind eye to the infiltration of gangsters within the union. The garment industry had been riddled for decades with small-time gangsters, who ran protection and loansharking rackets while offering muscle in labor disputes. First hired to strongarm strikers, some went to work for unions, who used them first for self-defense, then to intimidate strikebreakers and recalcitrant employers. ILG locals used &quot;Dopey&quot; Benny Fein and his sluggers, who were more often hired by unions than employers although they were thugs for hire.

Internecine warfare between labor sluggers eliminated many of the earliest racketeers. &quot;Little Augie&quot; Jacob Orgen took over the racket, providing muscle for the ILGWU in the 1926 strike. Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter had Orgen assassinated in 1927 in order to take over his operations. Buchalter took an interest in the industry, acquiring ownership of a number of trucking firms and control of local unions of truckdrivers in the garment district, while acquiring an ownership interest in some garment firms and local unions.

Buchalter, who had provided services for some locals of the Amalgamated during the 1920s. also acquired influence within the ACWA. One of his allies within the ACWA was Abraham Beckerman, a prominent member of the Socialist Party with close ties to &quot;The Forward&quot;, whom Hillman used to inflict strongarm tactics on his communist opponents within the union. Beckerman and Philip Orlofsky, another local officer in Cutters Local 4, made sweetheart deals with manufacturers that allowed them to subcontract to cut rate subcontractors out of town, using Buchalter&#x27;s trucking companies to bring the goods back and forth.

In 1931, Hillman resolved to act against Buchalter, Beckerman, and Orlofsky. He began by orchestrating public demands on Jimmy Walker, the corrupt Tammany Hall Mayor of New York, to crack down on racketeering in the garment district, Hillman then seized control of Local 4, expelling Beckerman and Orlofsky from the union, then taking action against corrupt union officials in Newark, New Jersey. The union then struck a number of manufacturers to bar the subcontracting of work to non-union or cut rate contractors in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In the course of that strike the union picketed a number of trucks run by Buchalter&#x27;s companies to prevent them from bringing finished goods back to New York.

While the campaign cleaned up the ACWA, it did not drive Buchalter out of the industry. The union may, in fact, have made a deal of some sort with Buchalter, although no evidence has ever surfaced, despite intensive efforts to find it by political opponents of the union, such as Thomas Dewey and Westbrook Pegler. Buchalter claimed, before his execution in 1944, that he had never had any deal with either Hillman or Dubinsky, head of the ILGWU. He did claim to have murdered a factory owner and labour opponents of Hillman at Hillman&#x27;s behest, a claim which was never corroborated.

=== Great Depression and CIO===
The Great Depression reduced the Amalgamated&#x27;s membership to one third or less of its former strength. Like many other unions, the ACWA revived with the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, whose promise of legal protection for workers&#x27; right to organize brought thousands of garment workers back to the ACWA. The AFL finally allowed the ACWA to affiliate in 1933.

Hillman was a supporter of the New Deal and Roosevelt from the outset. FDR named him to the Labor Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration in 1933 and to the National Industrial Recovery Board in 1934. Hillman provided key assistance to Senator Robert F. Wagner in the drafting of the National Labor Relations Act and to Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins in winning enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Within the AFL, Hillman was one of the strongest advocates for organizing the mass production industries, such as automobile manufacture and steel, where unions had almost no presence, as well as the textile industry, which was only partially organized. He was one of the original founders in 1935 of the Committee for Industrial Organizing (later the Congress of Industrial Organizations; CIO), an effort led by John L. Lewis, and became Vice-President of the CIO when it established itself as a separate union confederation in 1937.

Hillman played a role in nearly every major initiative of the CIO in those years. He oversaw, and provided major financial support for, the Textile Workers Organizing Committee, which sought to establish a new union for textile workers after the disastrous defeat of the United Textile Workers&#x27; strike in 1934. The Textile Workers Union of America, with more than 100,000 members, came out of that effort in 1939. Hillman also played a decisive role in mediating the internal disputes that nearly destroyed the United Auto Workers in its infancy in 1938 and helped create the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union of America through the CIO&#x27;s Department Store Workers Organizing Committee.

Hillman and Lewis eventually had a falling out, with Lewis advocating a more independent tack in dealing with the federal government than Hillman. Lewis, however, gradually distanced himself from the CIO, finally resigning as its head and then withdrawing the United Mine Workers from it in 1942. Hillman remained in it, still the second most visible leader after Philip Murray, Lewis&#x27; successor.

===Political activities===

Hillman and Dubinsky founded the American Labor Party in 1936, an ostensibly independent party that served as a halfway house for Socialists and other leftists who wanted to support FDR&#x27;s reelection but were not prepared to join the Democratic Party, with its alliance with the most reactionary white elites in the South. Dubinsky later split from the Labor Party over personal and political differences with Hillman to found the Liberal Party of New York.

Hillman was a strong opponent of Nazi Germany and a supporter of U.S. aid to England and France. Roosevelt appointed Hillman to the National Defense Advisory Committee in 1940 and named him associate director of the Office of Production Management in 1941. When FDR created the War Production Board in 1942, he appointed Hillman to serve as the head of its labor division.

As in the case in World War I, Hillman used the influence of the federal government to advance both labor&#x27;s social goals and its immediate organizing needs. Hillman was unable to persuade the Board to debar labor law violators but did help introduce arbitration as an alternative to strikes in defense industries. Hillman&#x27;s prioritization of emergency production for national defense over labor radicalism brought him criticism from others within the CIO, as when he stood with the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s decision to send in troops to break a wildcat strike at the North American Aviation plant in Inglewood, California in 1941. (The strikers&#x27; wage demands were soon conceded in arbitration, which the Communist-supported strike had forestalled.)

Hillman also believed in the need for unions to mobilize their members politically. He and Lewis founded Labor&#x27;s Non-Partisan League, which campaigned for Roosevelt in 1936 and again in 1940, even though Lewis himself had endorsed Wendell Willkie that year. Hillman was the first chair of the CIO Political Action Committee, founded in 1942, as well as of the National Citizens Political Action Committee (NCPAC) (which co-founded the 1948 Progressive Party).

In July 1943, Philip Murray of the CIO led formation of the CIO-PAC, of which Hillman was the first head. In Roosevelt&#x27;s last election in 1944, Hillman raised nearly $1 million on behalf of the Democrat national ticket. Hillman was also credited with grass roots activities, registering labor voters and bringing them in heavy numbers to the polls. In 1945, he attended the World Trade Union Conference in London alongside many renowned trade unionists.

==Personal life==

Hillman and Bessie Abramowitz were married in 1916 and had two daughters.

== Death ==
Hillman, who had been sick for some time, died of a heart attack at age 59 on July 10, 1946, at his summer home in Point Lookout, New York. His body was interred in a mausoleum located at Westchester Hills Cemetery, 20 miles north of New York City.

==Legacy==
According to labor historian David Brody, Hillman built upon the conservative job-oriented unionism that dominated the American scene, discarding his youthful radicalism and opposition to capitalism. Hillman was realistic, nonideological, and eager for tangible results. Under Hillman&#x27;s leadership, the Amalgamated became an active partner in the men&#x27;s clothing business, building two banks, fostering low-cost unemployment insurance, and setting up internal educational and social support programs for union members. This was the &quot;New Unionism&quot;of the 1920s, which combined a large powerful union, with many small capitalist enterprises, all of them controlled by Jews who could talk together easily. Hillman&#x27;s broader perspective gave him a leading role in forming the CIO and establishing entirely new mass-production unions that confronted not small local Jewish capitalists but world-class corporations. Hillman also was a pioneer in integrating union power with major political powers on a national level. The New Deal had proven a bonanza for union membership growth, and beginning with the 1936 presidential election, Hillman pushed hard for labor to give systematic nationwide support to Roosevelt and the New Deal cause. His main rival was John L. Lewis, who broke with Roosevelt, and with the CIO, leaving Hillman the central labor politician in the national Democratic Party.

Hillman&#x27;s successor as head of the ACWA, Jacob Potofsky, took a far less visible role within the CIO, a federation which re-united with the AFL in 1955. The American Labor Party that Hillman had helped create passed out of existence in that same year.

The Amalgamated Housing Cooperative in the Bronx was the first limited equity housing cooperative in the United States. It was funded and inspired by Hillman and Abraham Kazan. A street in the neighborhood, Hillman Avenue, is named for him. Hillman is also the namesake of the Hillman Housing Corporation, a housing cooperative sponsored by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and part of Cooperative Village in Lower East Side of Manhattan.

The Sidney Hillman Foundation, established in his honor, gives annual awards to journalists and writers for work that supports social justice and progressive public policy. The first Sidney Hillman Awards were announced in 1950. In addition, from 1949 to 1995 the foundation made annual awards honoring public figures who pursue social justice and public policy for the common good.

<doc id="683452" wikidata="Q1207141" url="?curid=683452" title="9P (protocol)">
<text>9P (or the Plan 9 Filesystem Protocol or Styx) is a network protocol developed for the Plan 9 from Bell Labs distributed operating system as the means of connecting the components of a Plan 9 system. Files are key objects in Plan 9. They represent windows, network connections, processes, and almost anything else available in the operating system.

9P was revised for the 4th edition of Plan 9 under the name 9P2000, containing various improvements. Some of the improvements made are the removal of certain filename restrictions, the addition of a &#x27;last modifier&#x27; metadata field for directories, and authentication files. The latest version of the Inferno operating system also uses 9P2000. The Inferno file protocol was originally called Styx, but technically it has always been a variant of 9P.

A server implementation of 9P for Unix, called u9fs, is included in the Plan 9 distribution. A 9P OS X client kernel extension is provided by Mac9P. A kernel client driver implementing 9P with some extensions for Linux is part of the v9fs project. 9P and its derivatives have also found application in embedded environments, such as the Styx-on-a-Brick project for Lego Mindstorms Bricks.

== Server applications ==
Many of Plan 9&#x27;s applications take the form of 9P file servers. Examples include:
* acme: a text editor/development environment
* rio: the Plan 9 windowing system
* plumber: interprocess communication
* ftpfs: an FTP client that presents the files and directories on a remote FTP server in the local namespace
* wikifs: a wiki editing tool that presents a remote wiki as files in the local namespace
* webfs: a file server that retrieves data from URLs and presents the contents and details of responses as files in the local namespace

Outside of Plan 9, the 9P protocol is still used when a lightweight remote file system is required:
* NixOS: a Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager. NixOS can rebuild itself inside a virtual machine, where the client uses 9P to mount the package store directory of the host.
* GNU Guix: a package manager that can instantiate and manage Unix-like operating systems. It can instantiate a system inside a virtual machine in the same manner that NixOS does
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): since Windows 10 version 1903, the subsystem implements 9P as a server and the host Windows operating system acts as a client.
* Crostini: a custom 9P server is used to provide access to files outside of a Linux VM 
* QEMU: the VirtFS device allows for filesystem sharing over 9P, which is accelerated with kernel drivers and shared memory 
* DIOD: Distributed I/O Daemona 9P file server

<text>Lotzwil is a municipality in the district of Oberaargau in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

==History==
Lotzwil is first mentioned in 1194 as &quot;Locewillare&quot;.

During the Middle Ages the major landowners in Lotzwil included St. Urban&#x27;s Abbey and the Thunstetten Commandery. The area was ruled by the Baron of Langenstein until the extinction of that family, followed by the Utzigen and Balm families, then after 1370 the Gr√ºnenberg and Aarburg. In 1431 Th√ºring von Aarburg sold the village to Burgdorf. Burgdorf combined Lotzwil, Gutenburg, Kleindietwil, R√ºtschelen, Th√∂rigen and Bettenhausen together into the bailiwick of Lotzwil and made the bailiff a member of Burgdorf&#x27;s town council. Following the 1798 French invasion, the bailiwick was dissolved and the village became part of the District of Langenthal. In 1803 it became part of the Aarwangen District.

The village church was first mentioned in 1194. The current church was built in 1682‚Äì83 on the foundations of earlier churches from the Early and Late Middle Ages. In 1259 the Barons of Balm and Gr√ºnenberg gave the church to the Thunstetten Commandery. After the Protestant Reformation in 1528 the church was under Bernese authority.

During the 18th century, the economic boom in nearby Langenthal spread to Lotzwil. Linen spinning and weaving started as a cottage industry in the village. By the 19th century there were small linen factories and other small businesses. The village continued to grow after the opening of the Langenthal-Huttwil-Wolhusen rail line in 1889. Several factories opened including a wooden shoe factory in 1875, a weaving machine factory in 1889, leather processing in 1930 and later a kitchen appliance factory. Today the only remaining old factory makes bricks. Starting in the 1960s Lotzwil became a commuter town for Langenthal and several new housing developments were built for the growing population. In 1988, a regional nursing home, serving ten surrounding municipalities, opened. In the 19th century the community built a spa hotel, which was abandoned in the interwar period. Today it has been replaced by a renowned country inn.

<doc id="683456" wikidata="Q1274360" url="?curid=683456" title="The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism">
<text>The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism is a fictional book in George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (written in 1949). The fictional book was supposedly written by Emmanuel Goldstein, the principal enemy of the state of Oceania&#x27;s ruling party (The Party). The Party portrays Goldstein as a former member of the Inner Party who continually conspired to depose Big Brother and overthrow the government. In the novel, the fictional Goldstein&#x27;s book is read by the protagonist, Winston Smith, after a supposed friend, O&#x27;Brien, provided one copy to him. Winston had recalled that &quot;There were ... whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author, and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as The Book.&quot;

== Background ==
In &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the protagonist Winston Smith writes a diary in which he confesses thought crimes, such as his secret hatred of Big Brother and the Party. In the course of his work life at the Ministry of Truth, Winston approaches O&#x27;Brien, a member of the Inner Party, believing him part of the Brotherhood, Goldstein&#x27;s conspiracy against Oceania. Initially, O&#x27;Brien appears as such, especially in arranging to give Winston a copy of &quot;The Book&quot;, the possession of which is a crime in Oceania. In conversation, O&#x27;Brien tells Winston that &quot;The Book&quot; reveals the true, totalitarian nature of the dystopian society that The Party established in Oceania, and that full membership to the Brotherhood requires reading &quot;The Book&quot;. Winston describes his first encounter with &quot;The Book&quot;:
The term Oligarchical Collectivism refers to Ingsoc, the dominant ideology of Oceania, and to the ideologies of Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia and Death-worship (Obliteration of the Self) in Eastasia. Winston reads two long excerpts establishing how the three totalitarian super-states ‚Äì Eastasia, Eurasia, Oceania ‚Äì emerged from a global war, thus connecting the past to his present, the year 1984, and explains the basic political philosophy of the totalitarianism that derived from the authoritarian political tendencies manifested in the twentieth century. That the three, ostensibly opposing ideologies are functionally identical is the central revelation of &quot;The Book&quot;.

Theoretically, Oligarchical Collectivism recalls the theory of bureaucratic collectivism put forth by some Trotskyists in the late 1930s as a description of the Soviet Union under Stalin. Oceania&#x27;s principal enemy of the people, Emmanuel Goldstein, is modelled after Leon Trotsky, a former member of the inner circle of the Bolshevik Party whom Stalin purged and then declared an enemy of the people of the Soviet Union, the socialist state that Trotsky had helped found in Russia. From exile, Trotsky criticised the social system of the Soviet Union.

== Contents ==
&quot;Chapter I: Ignorance is Strength&quot;, and &quot;Chapter III: War is Peace&quot; of &quot;The Book&quot; are titled with The Party&#x27;s slogans; O&#x27;Brien later refers to chapters featuring a programme for deposing the inner party.

Chapter II, presumably titled &quot;Freedom is Slavery&quot; after the remaining inner party&#x27;s slogan, is not detailed in the novel. However, O&#x27;Brien later explains the meaning of the slogan: the free man is always condemned to defeat and death; only when he submits to the collective and eternal Party can he become omnipotent and immortal.

=== Chapter I ===
&quot;Ignorance is Strength&quot; details the perpetual class struggle characteristic of human societies; beginning with the historical observation that societies always have hierarchically divided themselves into social classes and castes: the High (who rule); the Middle (who work for, and yearn to supplant the High), and the Low (whose goal is daily survival). Cyclically, the Middle deposed the High, by enlisting the Low. Upon assuming power, however, the Middle (the new High class) recast the Low into their usual servitude. In the event, the classes perpetually repeat the cycle, when the Middle class speaks to the Low class of &quot;justice&quot; and of &quot;human brotherhood&quot; in aid of becoming the High class rulers.

Ian Slater writes that Goldstein goes beyond George Orwell&#x27;s beliefs in earlier work, such as &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, in which the Middle makes a pretence of believing in equality. In &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, the state sought power to improve society, but once technological advances make equality possible, the Middle abandons their former promises, as socialism only stands in the way of their aims; they become explicitly tyrannical and openly hostile to equality. The new rhetoric of the Middle becomes Ingsoc and hierarchical collectivism. This naked pursuit of power, without any pretense of concern for equality, distinguishes The Party from previous tyrannies, though The Party initially justifies its control through dedication to socialism. By focusing on collectivism, The Party can consolidate their power and present Ingsoc as an inevitable followup to capitalism in which the Low are no longer exploited. In reality, the social castes are no longer necessary, and collectivism only serves to prolong the exploitation of the Low. Slater states that while O&#x27;Brien does not own his mansion, he still lives in luxury compared to the lower castes. Once The Party consolidates its power, all justifications are abandoned. The Party itself is a meritocracy, not hereditary. This is not rooted in egalitarianism but practicality, as The Party realizes that its continuation depends on purity of orthodoxy, rather than a bloodline.

Unlike Orwell&#x27;s prior writing, The Party&#x27;s exploitation in this case is fully intentional. Slater writes that Orwell desired to show through The Party&#x27;s unrealistic politics that modern authoritarianism was growing more lustful of power for power&#x27;s sake. Orwell believed that modern states could bring about the desires of the Spanish Inquisition not only to control people but also to control their thoughts. This could be achieved through technological breakthroughs, such as the telescreen, a two-way television that allows continuous government surveillance of the population. Efficient use of such technology to control the populace requires centralisation, and the four ministries of Oceania ‚Äì the Ministries of Truth, Peace, Love, and Plenty ‚Äì fill this need.

The Proles usually are not subject to propaganda. Instead, it is the middle class ‚Äì the Outer Party ‚Äì that the Inner Party fears. Because the Proles have lost everything and have nothing, they have no future. The Party, through the Ministry of Truth, practices historical revisionism, which robs the Proles of a past, too. Robbed of the ability to learn from history and the worries of the future, the Proles exist in a state of constant present and are incapable of revolution. In order to prevent any unorthodoxy, the Ministry of Truth uses Newspeak, an impoverished language that makes heresy impossible by omitting words that could express it. Newspeak also reduces thought to simple opposites, such as good and &quot;ungood&quot;, an intentional dichotomy that hides nuance and ambiguity while promoting black and white thinking. Inner party&#x27;s members are further subject to self-deceptive habits of mind, such as &quot;crimestop&quot; (&quot;preventive stupidity&quot;), which halts thinking at the threshold of politically dangerous thought, and &quot;doublethink&quot;, which allows simultaneously holding and believing contradictory thoughts without noticing the contradiction, to wit:

=== Chapter III ===
Before reading the first chapter, Winston reads the third chapter &quot;War is Peace&quot;, which explains that slogan-title&#x27;s meaning, by reviewing how the global super-states were established: The United States merged with the British Empire (and later Latin America) to form Oceania; the Soviet Union absorbed mainland Europe to form Eurasia; and Eastasia emerged &quot;after a decade of confused fighting&quot;, with China proper&#x27;s annexation of Japan, Korea and parts of Mongolia and Tibet. In various alliances, they have warred for twenty-five years. Yet the perpetual war is militarily nonsensical, because &quot;it is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference&quot;, since each is a totalitarian state.

Scientific advance is held carefully in check, as The Party does not want to allow for any unaccounted abundance of goods, which could conceivably raise the quality of life beyond bare subsistence for the Proles. The only technological advances permitted are in mind control and genocide, the twin goals of each of the superstates. Once mind control is perfected, the superstates are free to destroy their counterparts in a theoretical single, decisive strike that precludes retaliation. Technological advancement, even in war, can be counterproductive to the goals of The Party; none of the superstates are a true threat to each other, as they all must exist in a state of permanent limited war to survive. By harnessing the hysteria of war and demand for self-sacrifice, each of the nations declare war not on each other but on their own populace, who are kept ignorant, on the brink of starvation, and overworked. Permanent limited war also allows for The Party to divert attention away from domestic concerns and their failures. Instead of promises of an &quot;easy, safe life&quot;, Slater writes that Orwell believed that the populace requires heroic nationalism. Thus, war becomes a psychological tool to establish a kind of ironic &quot;peace&quot;, a stasis where progress is impossible and nothing ever changes, except for the possibility of eventual global conquest. However, even though inner party&#x27;s members have devoted their lives to establishing Oceania as the universal world power, they use doublethink also in connection with the war, knowing that it is necessary for the conflict to go on indefinitely to keep the structure of Oceanic society intact.

=== Later chapters ===
Winston never has the opportunity to finish reading &quot;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism&quot;, and learn the &quot;Whys?&quot; of Oceania and the world order in 1984 before the Thought Police arrest him and Julia, yet he believes that the hope of change lies within the Proles. The question of &#x27;Why?&#x27; is later revealed to him by O&#x27;Brien during the torture: 

&quot;Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture.&quot;

&quot;Always we shall have the heretic here
at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible--and in the end
utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own
accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of
victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless
pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power.&quot;

== Authorship ==
O&#x27;Brien rejects as nonsense Winston Smith&#x27;s perspective that Big Brother and The Party can be overthrown, because he is a fiercely devoted member of the inner party, and not a revolutionary of the Brotherhood. At the Miniluv, O&#x27;Brien tortures Winston to &quot;cure&quot; him of his political insanity: the belief that there exists an objective reality that is external to the reality of The Party. In their torture chamber conversations, he tells Winston that &quot;The Book&quot; (fictional book supposedly written by Goldstein) was actually written by a committee that included himself. When Winston asks O&#x27;Brien if &quot;The Book&quot; is true, he replies: &quot;As description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense.&quot; The reader never knows whether O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s version is true, or Goldstein&#x27;s authorship is the truthful version, since The Party changes the past in order to control the present and the future, that stands on the words: &quot;those who control the past control the future. And who controls the present controls the past&quot;. So, The Party (in each superstate) controls the present, changes the past, and forces the future in their interest and pervasive existence (avoiding &quot;the Middles&quot;) to do what they did in order to reach power and control through government and bureaucratic collectivism. Therefore, keeping the oligarchical collectivism and perpetuating Big Brother&#x27;s rule.

==Significance==
Eric Cheyfitz noted that &quot;whatever the function of [this book] is within the plot of the novel, Orwell uses its extensive elaboration in the novel to make political points about the present of 1949 and the future he imagines unfolding from this present.&quot;

The book has been described as a parody and critique of &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot; (1937), by Leon Trotsky; and &quot;The Managerial Revolution&quot; (1941), by James Burnham, a former Trotskyist.

He bats and throws left-handed.

==Career==

Ledezma was originally signed by the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent in 1998. He started his career with the DSL Red Sox in 1998, playing for them one season before joining the GCL Red Sox (1999) and the Augusta Greenjackets (2000). He missed the entire 2001 season due to a stress fracture in his left elbow. In 2002, he returned to Augusta but was shut down for the rest of the season on May 22 due to a lower back strain.

===Detroit Tigers===
Ledezma was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 2002 Rule 5 draft on December 16, 2002, and made his Major League debut on April 2, 2003, for the Tigers, working two scoreless innings against the Minnesota Twins. His first win came in a two-inning relief appearance on June 4 against the San Diego Padres. He made his first start on July 8 against the Chicago White Sox. Overall, he was in 34 games (8 starts) during his rookie season and finished 3‚Äì7 with a 5.79 ERA.

Between 2004 and 2007, he alternated between pitching for the Tigers and for the AA Erie SeaWolves and AAA Toledo Mud Hens.

<text>List A cricket is a classification of the limited-overs (one-day) form of the sport of cricket, with games lasting up to eight hours. List A cricket includes One Day International (ODI) matches and various domestic competitions in which the number of overs in an innings per team ranges from forty to sixty, mostly commonly fifty overs, as well as some international matches involving nations who have not achieved official ODI status. Together with first-class and Twenty20 cricket, List A is one of the three major forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In November 2021, the ICC retrospectively applied List A status to women&#x27;s cricket, aligning it with the men&#x27;s game.

==Status==
Most Test cricketing nations have some form of domestic List A competition. The scheduled number of overs in List A cricket ranges from forty to sixty overs per side, mostly commonly fifty overs.

The categorisation of cricket matches as &quot;List A&quot; was not officially endorsed by the International Cricket Council until 2006, when the ICC announced it, along with its member associations, would be determining this classification in a manner similar to that done for first-class matches.

The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians created this category for the purpose of providing an equivalent to first-class cricket, to allow the generation of career records and statistics for comparable one-day matches. Only the more important one-day competitions in each country, plus matches against a touring Test team, are included. The categorisation was the work of Philip Bailey.

‚Ä¢ Australia A cricket team

‚Ä¢ Afghanistan A cricket team

‚Ä¢ Bangladesh A cricket team

‚Ä¢ England A cricket team

‚Ä¢ India A cricket team

‚Ä¢ Ireland A cricket team

‚Ä¢ New Zealand A cricket team

‚Ä¢ Pakistan A cricket team

‚Ä¢ South Africa A cricket team

‚Ä¢ Sri Lanka A cricket team

‚Ä¢ West Indies A cricket team

‚Ä¢ Zimbabwe A cricket team

Matches were divided into three categories: 
* List A comprised the matches to be included in the final list.
* List B was for matches where the players were of First-Class standard but the match was not considered to be of sufficient status (e.g. exhibition matches).
* List C was to collect any other matches played by a team that had at some time previously appeared in List A, thus showing that the status of such matches had not been overlooked.

=== Matches that qualify as List A ===
* One Day Internationals (ODIs)
* Certain other international matches
* Premier one-day tournaments in the 12 ICC Full Members
* Official matches of a touring Test team against main first-class teams
* Matches played in ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League and above, and previously the higher levels of the ICC World Cricket League

=== Matches that do not qualify as List A ===
* Twenty20 cricket, including internationals, which is classified separately
* World Cup warm-up matches
* Other Tourist matches (for example, against first-class teams that are not part of the main domestic first-class competition, such as universities)
* Festival and friendly matches
* Matches not played under standard conditions (for example, more than 11 players per side)

==First List A match==
The first match retrospectively designated as a &#x27;List A&#x27; game was played between Lancashire and Leicestershire in May 1963, in the preliminary round of the Gillette Cup. Each side batted for 65 overs, and bowlers were restricted to 15 overs each.

<doc id="683468" wikidata="Q659033" url="?curid=683468" title="Biliary atresia">
<text>Biliary atresia, also known as extrahepatic ductopenia and progressive obliterative cholangiopathy, is a childhood disease of the liver in which one or more bile ducts are abnormally narrow, blocked, or absent. It can be congenital or acquired. Biliary atresia is the most common reason for pediatric liver trasplantation in the United States. It has an incidence of one in 10,000‚Äì15,000 live births in the United States, and a prevalence of one in 16,700 in the British Isles. Globally, biliary atresia cases are most common in East Asia, with a frequency of one in 5,000.

The cause of biliary atresia in Egyptian infants has been proven to be as a result of aflatoxin induced cholangiopathy acquired prenatally in infants who have glutathione S transferase M1 deficiency. The biliary atresia phenotype caused by congenital aflatoxicosis in GST M1 deficient neonates is named Kotb disease. Syndromic biliary atresia (e.g. Biliary Atresia Splenic Malformation (BASM)) has been associated with certain genes (e.g. Polycystic Kidney Disease 1 Like 1 - PKD1L1), and some infants with isolated biliary atresia may arise as a result of an autoimmune inflammatory response, possibly due to a viral infection of the liver soon after birth. In animals plant toxins have been shown to cause biliary atresia. The only effective treatments are operations such as the Kasai procedure and liver transplantation.

==Signs and symptoms==
Initially, the symptoms of biliary atresia are indistinguishable from those of neonatal jaundice, a usually harmless condition commonly seen in infants. However, infants with biliary atresia develop progressive conjugated jaundice, pale white stools, dark urine, and an enlarged palpable liver. Some infants fail to thrive as there will be a degree of fat and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption (e.g. Vitamin K). This may cause a bleeding tendency. Eventually, and usually after 2 months, cirrhosis with portal hypertension will develop. If left untreated, biliary atresia can lead to liver failure. Unlike other forms of jaundice, however, biliary-atresia-related cholestasis mostly does not result in kernicterus, a form of brain damage resulting from liver dysfunction. This is because in biliary atresia, the liver, although diseased, is still able to conjugate bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin is unable to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.

== Causes ==
The cause of biliary atresia in most infants is not fully understood and it is well possible that a number of factors may play a role, but especially maternal rotavirus infection during pregnancy and subsequent transmission of the virus to the child resulting in infection of the biliary epithelium and subsequent occluding fibrosis may be important in this respect. Some cases may relate to infection with other viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, hepatotropic virus reovirus 3, or congenital cytomegalovirus. In addition, autoimmune processes may contribute to pathogenesis in some cases as well. However, with regard to these alternative causation the experimental evidence remains rather weak.

===Genetics===

An association between biliary atresia and the &quot;ADD3&quot; gene was first detected in Chinese populations through a genome-wide association study, and was confirmed in Thai Asians and Caucasians. A possible association with deletion of the gene &quot;GPC1&quot;, which encodes a glypican 1-a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, has been reported. This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q37) and is involved in the regulation of inflammation and the Hedgehog gene.

Egyptian infants with biliary atresia were found to have null &quot;GSTM1&quot; genotype while all their mothers were heterozygous for &quot;GSTM1&quot;. Thus these infants may be protected in utero by their maternal detoxification system, yet once born they cannot handle the detoxification of an aflatoxin load.

===Toxins===

Some cases of biliary atresia may result from exposure to aflatoxin B1, and to a lesser extent aflatoxin B2 during late pregnancy. Intact maternal detoxification protects baby during intrauterine life, yet after delivery, the baby struggles with the aflatoxin in its blood and liver. Moreover, the baby feeds aflatoxin M1 from its mom, as aflatoxin M1 is the detoxification product of aflatoxin B1. It is a milder toxin that causes cholangitis in the baby.

There are isolated examples of biliary atresia in animals. For instance, lambs born to sheep grazing on land contaminated with a weed (Red Crumbweed) developed biliary atresia at certain times. The plants were later found to contain a toxin, now called biliatresone Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is a link between human cases of biliary atresia and toxins such as biliatresone. There are some indications that a metabolite of certain human gut bacteria may be similar to biliatresone.

==Pathophysiology==
There are three main types of extra-hepatic biliary atresia:
* Type I: Atresia is restricted to the common bile duct.
* Type II: Atresia of the common hepatic duct.
* Type III: Atresia involves the most proximal part of the bile ducts (&gt;95% of all cases).

In approximately 10% of cases, other anomalies may be associated with biliary atresia. The most common of these syndromic forms is BASM and might include heart lesions, polysplenia, situs inversus, absent venae cavae, and a preduodenal portal vein. Progressive cirrhosis is associated with signs and symptoms of portal hypertension, such as esophagogastric varix bleeding, hypersplenism, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatopulmonary syndrome.

In an Egyptian study, abnormally high levels of aflatoxin B1 and to a lesser extent aflatoxin B2 was found in liver tissue and blood of all neonates with biliary atresia. Aflatoxins may cause extensive damage to the hepatocytes leading to hepatitis and damage to bile ducts causing inflammation, adhesions and final obstruction of bile ducts. The affected neonates have a genetic detoxification defect that does not allow them to detoxify these aflatoxins timely or effectively. The babies have homozygous deficiency of glutathione S transferase (GST) M1. The aflatoxin damaged liver cells and bile duct cells are removed by neutrophil elastase and by involvement of immune system mediators such as CCL-2 or MCP-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), TGF-beta, endothelin (ET), and nitric oxide (NO). Among these, TGF-beta is the most important pro-fibrogenic cytokine that can be seen in progressive cirrhosis.

The cascade of immune involvement to remove damaged hepatocytes and cholangiocytes ushers regeneration. Yet in infants with biliary atresia regeneration is defective, and results in cirrhosis, as these infants have disrupted p53 and disrupted GSTPi. p53 and GSTPi are responsible for DNA fidelity at regeneration. Hence, these infants get accelerated cirrhosis and advance to portal hypertension.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by an assessment of history, physical examination in conjunction with blood tests, a liver biopsy, and ultrasound scans imaging and is prompted by prolonged or persistent jaundice, with abnormalities in liver function tests. Ultrasound or other forms of imaging such as radio-isotope liver scans can also be used but final confirmation is usually only reached at the time of exploratory surgery. Ultrasonography will usually show an absent or abnormal gallbladder.

===Differential diagnoses===
The differential diagnoses are extensive and include: Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Byler disease (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis), Caroli disease, choledochal cyst, cholestasis, congenital cytomegalovirus disease, congenital herpes simplex virus infection, congenital rubella, congenital syphilis, congenital toxoplasmosis, cystic fibrosis, galactosemia, idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, lipid storage disorders, neonatal hemochromatosis, and total parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis.

==Treatment==
Most (&gt;95%) infants with biliary atresia will undergo an operation designed to retain and salvage the native liver, restore bile flow, and reduce the level of jaundice. This is known as the Kasai procedure (after Morio Kasai, the Japanese surgeon who first developed the technique) or hepatoportoenterostomy. Although the procedure is not thought of as curative, it may relieve jaundice and stop liver fibrosis, allowing normal growth and development. Published series from Japan, North America, and the UK show that bilirubin levels will fall to normal values in about 50-55% of infants, allowing 40-50% to retain their own liver to reach the age of 5 and 10 years (and beyond). Liver transplantation is an option for those children whose liver function and symptoms fail to respond to a Kasai operation.

Recent large-scale studies by Davenport et al. (&quot;Annals of Surgery&quot;, 2008) show that the age of the patient is not an absolute clinical factor affecting prognosis. The influence of age differs according to the disease etiology‚Äîi.e., whether biliary atresia is isolated, cystic (CBA), or accompanied by splenic malformation (BASM).

It is widely accepted that corticosteroid treatment after a Kasai operation, with or without choleretics and antibiotics, has a beneficial effect on postoperative bile flow and can clear jaundice, but there is currently no consensus on the ideal dosing and duration of steroid use. Furthermore, it has been observed in many retrospective longitudinal studies that corticosteroid treatment does not seem to sigificantly prolong survival of the native liver or transplant-free survival.

==Epidemiology==
Biliary atresia seems to affect females slightly more often than males, and Asians and African Americans more often than Caucasians. It is common for only one child in a pair of twins or within the same family to have the condition. There seems to be no link to medications or immunizations given immediately before or during pregnancy. Diabetes during pregnancy particularly during the first trimester seems to predispose to a number of distinct congenital abnormalities in the infant such as sacral agenesis, transposition of the great vessels and the syndromic form of biliary atresia.

<text>Ayreon is a musical project by Dutch songwriter, singer, musician and record producer Arjen Anthony Lucassen. Ayreon&#x27;s music is described as progressive rock, progressive metal and power metal sometimes combined with genres such as folk, electronica, experimental and classical music. The majority of Ayreon&#x27;s albums are dubbed &quot;rock operas&quot; (or &quot;metal operas&quot;) because the albums contain complex storylines featuring a host of characters, usually with each one being represented by a unique vocalist.

Each Ayreon album tells a different story, but all, with the exception of &quot;Actual Fantasy&quot;, &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;, and &quot;Transitus&quot;, take place in the same fictional, science fiction universe; additionally, Lucassen&#x27;s solo album &quot;Lost in the New Real&quot; is also set in the Ayreon universe. Ayreon&#x27;s music is characterized by the use of traditional instruments in rock music (guitars, bass guitar, drums, analogue synthesizers, electric organs) mixed with instruments more native to folk and classical music (e.g. mandolins, violins, violas, celli, flutes, sitars and didgeridoos). Lucassen writes the music and the lyrics, sings and plays most of the instruments on all of the Ayreon albums, alongside many guest musicians. His most regular collaborator is drummer Ed Warby.

Due to the project&#x27;s particular nature, Ayreon live performances are rare. Several Ayreon songs were first included in two live albums by other Lucassen bands: &quot;Live on Earth&quot; by Star One (2003) and &quot;Live in the Real World&quot; by Stream of Passion (2006).

== History ==
=== Origins: &quot;The Final Experiment&quot; and &quot;Actual Fantasy&quot; (1995‚Äì1998) ===
The first Ayreon CD, released in 1995, is &quot;The Final Experiment&quot;, which has a mixture of science fiction and medieval themes. The album features thirteen singers and seven instrumentalists, most of them Dutch. &quot;The Final Experiment&quot; is often mentioned as one of the first metal operas. The album was originally titled &quot;Ayreon: The Final Experiment&quot;, with the artist listed as Arjen Lucassen, but upon re-release, the title was changed to &quot;The Final Experiment&quot;, and the artist was changed to Ayreon.

&quot;Actual Fantasy&quot; from 1996 is the only Ayreon album without a continuous story. With its individual fantasy stories, it can still be considered a concept album, though. There are only three singers and three instrumentalists on Actual Fantasy. Themes inspired by songs on this album can be found on later Ayreon releases, particularly the two Universal Migrator albums. The album did not sell as well as its predecessor.

=== Continuation of the Ayreon storyline (1998‚Äì2008) ===
The double album &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; followed in 1998, continuing the Ayreon storyline from &quot;The Final Experiment&quot;. The album features eight singers, each playing a role of a single character, and eleven instrumentalists. Arjen has stated that he wanted this particular album to be a more flight-and-fancy-free record, or &quot;pure escapism&quot; than the previous albums&#x27; more serious tones, and portrayed his characters in more of a B movie light. The album was a huge success and is widely regarded as one of Ayreon&#x27;s best albums.

The twin &quot;Universal Migrator&quot; albums were released in 2000. The first album, &quot;The Dream Sequencer&quot; consists of soft, atmospheric progressive rock, whereas the second album, &quot;Flight of the Migrator&quot;, consists of a more heavy-metal theme. Both of the albums feature around ten singers supported by many instrumentalists. One of the more notable guests was Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, who made an appearance on the &quot;Flight of the Migrator&quot; album.

Shortly following &quot;Universal Migrator&quot; came &quot;Ayreonauts Only&quot;, an album generally meant to be only for diehard fans of Ayreon. The album itself was the second to not follow a specific storyline; it instead contained alternate versions (With different vocalists or instrumentalists) of existing songs, or the original demos used when recording them. In addition, it contained a preview of Arjen&#x27;s then-upcoming project, Ambeon. It is the only Ayreon album not to see re-release on InsideOut.

In 2004 came &quot;The Human Equation&quot;. As on &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;, there are several singers, each playing their own role. With &quot;The Human Equation&quot;, Ayreon turned away from the usual science fiction and fantasy themes with a seemingly semi-normal psychological theme.

Starting in 2004, after changing from Transmission Records to InsideOut, Arjen began rereleasing his Ayreon catalog on the new label, with enhancements ranging from basic (The Universal Migrator, issued as a two-disc set instead of two separate albums) to drastic (Actual Fantasy, &quot;Revisited&quot; with completely re-recorded drums, bass, synth and flute). In 2005, to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Ayreon, &quot;The Final Experiment&quot; was reissued with a bonus semi-acoustic disc.

At the end of September 2006, when Arjen&#x27;s new studio was finished, he began making a new album entitled &quot;01011001&quot;, which was released on 23 January 2008. This album was noticeably darker than previous Ayreon releases, Lucassen attributes this to a depression and his divorce in the preceding year.

On 25 April 2008, Arjen released a new Ayreon EP named &quot;Elected&quot;. The EP features two tracks from &quot;01011001&quot;, one from &quot;The Human Equation&quot; and an Alice Cooper cover (&quot;Elected&quot;), with vocals by Arjen and Tobias Sammet.

On 16 September 2008, Arjen announced in his official website the release of &quot;Timeline&quot;, his second compilation album, that will reunite selected songs from all Ayreon albums and an unreleased one in three CDs and a DVD. The album was released on 7 November 2008 in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and all of the EU on 17 November 2008. It was released in America on 13 January 2009.

=== Hiatus (2008‚Äì2012) ===
Arjen took a break from Ayreon and completed a new side project, Guilt Machine, in 2009. He also went on to release a second Star One album in 2010, and then a solo album under his own name in 2012.

=== &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; and &quot;The Source&quot; (2012‚Äì2017) ===
&quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; was released on 28 October 2013. In 2015, &quot;The Human Equation&quot; was performed in its entirety live in an unofficial full-scale theatrical production called &quot;The Theater Equation&quot;, with Lucassen making an appearance and helping promote the project. It was performed four times, all at the Nieuwe Luxor theater in Rotterdam between 18 and 20 September. Although produced as an unofficial series of performances, it was recorded and released in June of the following year as an official Ayreon release, &quot;The Theater Equation&quot;, produced and mixed by Lucassen himself.

&quot;The Source&quot; was released on 28 April 2017, marking a return to science fiction and the Ayreon storyline. It is Lucassen&#x27;s first album under his new label, Mascot Label Group.

=== Focus on live performances (2017‚Äì2020) ===
In November 2016, Lucassen announced the first ever official Ayreon concerts for September 2017, entitled &quot;Ayreon Universe&quot;. The show featured 16 singers and 11 instrumentalists, all of which had previously worked together with Lucassen on his studio albums. Unlike &quot;The Theater Equation&quot;, it consisted of unrelated songs from Ayreon performed after each other as in a traditional concert, with a few songs from Star One featured as well. One of the performances was released as a live album/DVD on 30 March 2018, titled &quot;Ayreon Universe ‚Äì The Best of Ayreon Live&quot;.

On 7 December 2017, Lucassen stated that a new Ayreon concert would take place on 22 June 2018 at Graspop Metal Meeting, where they would headline the Marquee stage. It featured the same instrumentalists as the Ayreon Universe shows and most of its vocalists, along with Simone Simons and Tom S. Englund, who had never performed live with Ayreon before, and Mark Jansen, who had never collaborated with Lucassen before, and Barry Hay; Lucassen himself also performed a few songs.

Between 13 and 15 September 2019, the album &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; was performed in Tilburg in its entirety similarly to &quot;The Theater Equation&quot; in 2015, this time as official Ayreon performances. Fish, Anneke van Giersbergen, Damian Wilson, Edward Reekers, Edwin Balogh, and George Oosthoek returned from the original cast, alongside Ed Warby and flutist Thijs van Leer, who also performed on the original album. Simone Simons and Mark Jansen of Epica, Praying Mantis singer John Jaycee Cuijpers, Marcela Bovio, Bovio&#x27;s husband and VUUR bassist Johan van Stratum, and Ex Libris members Dianne van Giersbergen and Bob Wijtsma were also featured, with actor John de Lancie acting as narrator. One of the performances was released as the live album &quot;Electric Castle Live and Other Tales&quot; on 27 March 2020.

Ayreon was supposed to headline the Night of the Prog Festival in Germany on 18 July 2020 to perform &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; once again, however the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== &quot;Transitus&quot; and continued live performances (2020‚Äìpresent) ===
On 8 May 2020, Lucassen revealed on his YouTube channel that his next album would be an Ayreon album, titled &quot;Transitus&quot; and to be released the same year; the album would be released alongside a tie-in comic book.

On 13 May 2020, he announced the first member of the cast, actor Tom Baker, providing spoken vocals as the character of &quot;The Storyteller&quot;. The rest of the cast was announced during the following week, also including Tommy Karevik of Kamelot and Seventh Wonder as the lead character of Daniel, Cammie Gilbert of Oceans of Slumber as Abby, Micheal &quot;Mike&quot; Mills of Toehider as The Statue, Amanda Somerville as Lavinia, Paul Manzi of Arena and The Sweet as Henry, Dianne van Giersbergen of Ex Libris as The Soprano, Threshold drummer Johanne James as Abraham, Simone Simons of Epica as The Angel of Death, and Dee Snider of Twisted Sister as Daniel&#x27;s Father; Marcela Bovio of MaYaN (and Lucassen&#x27;s former band Stream of Passion) and Caroline Westendorp of The Charm the Fury portray a duo of characters known as the Furies.

Featured musicians include Joe Satriani and former Megadeth member Marty Friedman on lead guitars and YouTube musician Patty Gurdy on the hurdy-gurdy. Keyboardist Joost van den Broek, violinist Ben Mathot, and flutist Jeroen Goossens, all of whom had been featured on every Ayreon album since 2008&#x27;s &quot;01011001&quot;, are also returning. Juan van Emmerloot acted as drummer, making &quot;Transitus&quot; Ayreon&#x27;s second album after 2000&#x27;s &quot;Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer&quot; not to have Ed Warby on drums, as Lucassen stated that he did not originally conceive &quot;Transitus&quot; as an Ayreon album, and felt like it would need a completely different style of drummer. Although they had long lost track of each other, he and Van Emmerloot had worked together 35 years prior, when Lucassen was part of Vengeance and Van Emmerloot was a session drummer; after becoming curious about what had happened to Van Emmerloot since their last meeting, Lucassen looked his drumming videos on YouTube and realized he would be a perfect fit for &quot;Transitus&quot;.

&quot;Transitus&quot; was released on 25 September 2020.

On 13 October 2022, Lucassen announced more Ayreon concerts in September 2023 in Tilburg, in which the studio album &quot;01011001&quot; was performed in its entirety. The shows were recorded for a live album titled &quot;01011001 - Live Beneath the Waves&quot;, to be released on 17 May 2024.

== Etymology ==
Lucassen said, &quot;Though I do like the similarity of the sound of my own name Arjen and the project name Ayreon, this is purely coincidental. Yet no one seems to believe that! Originally I called the leading character of the first Ayreon album &#x27;Aries&#x27;. But then I had to change it because it had to fit the meter of the song. I wanted the new name to sound old fashioned because of the medieval influences, so I used the old-English sounding &#x27;AY&#x27; (Aylesbury, Ayrshire). But I also wanted it to sound modern because of the futuristic parts (&quot;2084&quot;) so I used &#x27;ON&#x27; (electron, neutron, etc.), hence &#x27;Ayreon&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="683486" wikidata="Q1132535" url="?curid=683486" title="Little Big Man (film)">
<text>Little Big Man is a 1970 American revisionist Western film directed by Arthur Penn, adapted by Calder Willingham from Thomas Berger&#x27;s 1964 novel of the same title. It stars Dustin Hoffman, Chief Dan George, Faye Dunaway, Martin Balsam, Jeff Corey and Richard Mulligan. The film follows the life of a white man who was raised by members of the Cheyenne nation during the 19th century, and then attempts to reintegrate with American pioneer society. Although broadly categorized as a Western, or an epic, the film encompasses several literary/film genres, including comedy, drama and adventure. It parodies typical tropes of the Western genre, contrasting the lives of white settlers and Native Americans throughout the progression of the boy&#x27;s life.

&quot;Little Big Man&quot; is an early revisionist Western in its sympathetic depiction of Native Americans, and its exposure of the villainous practices of the United States Cavalry. The revision uses elements of satire and tragedy to examine prejudice and injustice. &quot;Little Big Man&quot; is an anti-establishment film of the period, indirectly protesting America&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War by portraying the United States Armed Forces negatively.

The film was released to American theatres by National General Pictures on December 23, 1970, to widespread critical acclaim and commercial success. Several retrospective reviews have positioned &quot;Little Big Man&quot; as one of the best American films of the 1970s. The film received three BAFTA Award nominations, including for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Hoffman. Chief Dan George received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, the first Indigenous North American actor to be nominated for an Oscar. 

In 2014, &quot;Little Big Man&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
The film is framed with narration by 121-year-old Jack Crabb, who is telling his life story to a historian. In 1859, 10-year-old Jack and his sister Caroline survive the massacre of their parents by the Pawnee, and are discovered by Shadow, a Cheyenne brave, who takes the siblings to his village. Caroline escapes, but Jack remains and is reared by the good-hearted tribal leader, Old Lodge Skins. Jack unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear. Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack when he saves Younger Bear&#x27;s life. Jack is given the name &quot;Little Big Man&quot;.

In 1865, Jack is captured by U.S. Cavalry troopers during a skirmish, and renounces his Cheyenne upbringing to save himself from being killed. Jack is put in the foster care of Reverend Silas Pendrake and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise, who tries to seduce Jack. After witnessing Mrs. Pendrake having sex with the soda shop owner, Jack leaves the Pendrake household and renounces his foster parents and religion.

In 1866, Jack becomes the apprentice of snake-oil salesman Meriweather. The two are tarred and feathered when their customers realize that Meriweather&#x27;s products are fraudulent. One angry customer is Jack&#x27;s now-grown sister Caroline, with whom he reunites. She attempts to mold her brother into a gunslinger named &quot;the Soda Pop Kid&quot;. At a saloon, Jack meets Wild Bill Hickok, who takes a liking to him. When Hickok is forced to kill a man in self-defense, Jack loses his taste for gunslinging, and Caroline deserts him.

Jack becomes a partner in a general store and marries Olga, a Swedish woman. Jack&#x27;s business partner turns out to be a thieving scoundrel. Cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer pays a visit. He suggests the couple restart their lives further west, and assures them they have nothing to fear from &quot;Indians.&quot; The couple set out, but their stagecoach is ambushed by Cheyenne warriors, and Olga is abducted. Setting out in search of her, Jack is reunited with Old Lodge Skins and Younger Bear. Younger Bear has become a Contrary ‚Äî a warrior who does everything in reverse. Jack makes friends with the Heemaneh Little Horse, but continues his search for Olga.

Jack becomes a &quot;muleskinner&quot; in Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry, only because Custer incorrectly determines that was Jack&#x27;s past job. He takes part in a battle against the Cheyenne, but when the troopers begin killing women and children, Jack flees. Jack is attacked by Shadow, who does not recognize him. Shadow is killed by a cavalryman, and Jack discovers Shadow&#x27;s daughter Sunshine giving birth while hiding from the onslaught. He returns with her to Old Lodge Skins&#x27;s tribe. Sunshine becomes his wife and bears him a child. Jack again encounters Younger Bear, who is now the henpecked husband of the long-lost Olga. Olga does not recognize Jack, who makes no attempt to make her remember him. Jack reluctantly takes in Sunshine&#x27;s widowed sisters as wives, and agrees to father children with them. 

In November 1868, Custer and the 7th¬†Cavalry attack the Cheyenne camp at the Washita River. Jack saves the now-blind and elderly Old Lodge Skins, but Sunshine, their child, and her sisters are killed. Jack tries to infiltrate Custer&#x27;s camp to exact revenge, but loses his nerve. Disheartened, Jack becomes the town drunk in Deadwood, South Dakota. While in a drunken stupor, he is recognized by Wild Bill Hickok, who gives him money to clean up. Hickok is shot and killed while playing cards and, with his last breath, asks Jack to bring money to a widow with whom he was having an affair. The &quot;widow&quot; turns out to be Louise Pendrake, now a prostitute. Jack gives her the money, but again rebuffs her sexual advances.

Jack becomes a trapper and hermit. His mind becomes unhinged after coming across an empty trap with a severed animal limb. While attempting suicide, he sees Custer and his troops marching nearby and decides to resume his quest for revenge. Custer hires Jack as a scout, reasoning that anything he says will be a lie, thus serving as a perfect reverse barometer. 

In 1876, Jack tricks Custer into leading his troops into a trap at the Little Bighorn by truthfully telling Custer of the overwhelming force of Native Americans hidden in the valley. As his troops are slaughtered by the Sioux and Cheyenne, Custer begins to rave insanely. A wounded Jack tells him to shut up. Custer attempts to shoot him but is killed by Younger Bear, who then carries Jack away from the battlefield. Having thus discharged his life debt, Younger Bear announces that the next time they meet, he can kill Jack without becoming an evil person.

Back at the Cheyenne camp, Jack accompanies Old Lodge Skins to the Indian burial ground, where the old man, dressed in full chief&#x27;s regalia, decides to end his life with dignity. He offers his spirit to the Great Spirit, and lies down at his spot at the Indian Burial Ground to wait for death. Instead, it begins to rain. Old Lodge Skins is revealed to still be alive, and says, &quot;Well, sometimes the magic works. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.&quot; They return to his lodge to have dinner.

Back in the present day, Jack ends his narrative story and dismisses the historian.

==Cast==

==Historical basis==
The historical Little Big Man was a Native American leader bearing no resemblance to the Jack Crabb character. Little Big Man is known for his involvement in the capture and possible assassination of Crazy Horse at Fort Robinson in 1877.

The movie&#x27;s portrayal of the Battle of Washita River as a Custer-led massacre of women and children (which Penn compares to the Holocaust) is not entirely accurate, as the camp was partially occupied by tribal warriors. The film, however, is consistent with historical records of other encounters between Indians and the U.S. Cavalry; the Cavalry&#x27;s common tactic was to wait until the warriors had left the camp to hunt, or to lure the warriors away with assurances of good hunting, then to attack the unprotected village. The two massacre scenes are historically reversed; the Sand Creek massacre occurred first in 1864, in which Colorado militia (not including Custer) attacked a peaceful contingent of Native Americans, killing more than 150 women, children and elderly men. (The Sand Creek Massacre was depicted in another 1970 Western, &quot;Soldier Blue&quot;.) The Custer-led raid on the Washita occurred in 1868.

The film also presents an inaccurate representation of the death of Wild Bill Hickok. Hickok was actually killed nearly two months after the Battle of the Little Bighorn, on August 2, 1876, while playing poker at Nuttal &amp; Mann&#x27;s Saloon in Deadwood, South Dakota. Uncharacteristically, Hickok had his back turned to the door. At 4:15¬†p.m., Jack McCall walked in and shot Hickok in the back of the head. Hickok was famously holding two pairs ‚Äî aces of uncertain suits and black eights ‚Äî when he was shot, a set of cards thereafter called the &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Hand&quot;.

The film&#x27;s depiction of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer as a lunatic at the Battle of the Little Bighorn was intended as satire, although many of his quirks and vanities were inspired by contemporary observations. Custer&#x27;s fatal tactics at the Little Bighorn were far more complex than portrayed in the film, which portrays him as having a searing hatred of Indians, and acting ruthlessly towards them in battle.

The character of Jack Crabb is partially based on Curley, one of Custer&#x27;s Native American scouts from the Crow tribe. Curley rode with Custer&#x27;s 7th¬†Cavalry into the valley of the Little Bighorn, but was relieved of duty before the final attack, retreating to a nearby bluff to witness much of the action. Many conflicting stories of the era embellished Curley&#x27;s participation, stating in several cases that he disguised himself with a Cheyenne blanket to escape the immediate field of battle. He was interviewed many times, with some writers claiming him to be the only surviving witness from the U.S. side of Custer&#x27;s Last Stand. Curley gave several variations of his participation in the battle, and the accuracy of his later recollections has been questioned. However, Thomas Leforge, who had recruited most of the Crow scouts for the event, maintained in Leforge&#x27;s narrated biography that the claims were false, and that Curley neither took part as a scout had been expected to take part, nor claimed to have been in the battle.

==Production==
To obtain the hoarse voice of a 121-year-old man, Dustin Hoffman sat in his dressing room, screaming at the top of his lungs for an hour. The makeup for the ancient Crabb was created by Dick Smith from foam latex, and included revolutionary false eyelids that could blink along with the actor&#x27;s. Due to editing, and much to Smith&#x27;s chagrin, no blinks were visible in the finished film. Of the makeup, Hoffman was quoted in &quot;Life&quot; as saying, &quot;I defy you to put on that makeup and not feel old&quot;.

The role of Chief Old Lodge Skins was initially offered to Marlon Brando, Paul Scofield and Laurence Olivier, all of whom turned it down. The Little Bighorn battle scenes were filmed on location at Crow Agency, Montana, near the actual battle site. Some of the town scenes were filmed in Nevada City, Montana, a town that, by 1970, consisted predominantly of historic 19th-century buildings brought from elsewhere in Montana.

Aside from the Little Bighorn battle, all outdoor Indian scenes were filmed near Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Some interior and various other footage was shot on Hollywood sets. All Indian extras were North American Indians; although Aim√©e Eccles, who played Sunshine, is of British and Chinese descent, and Cal Bellini, who played Younger Bear, was a Malay originally from Singapore.

Old Lodge Skins dies at the end of the novel, but not in the film. In an interview, Arthur Penn explained the change: &quot;We thought long and hard about this and in the first draft of the script he does die, but this death would have introduced an element of sadness into the film and we didn&#x27;t want this. The film would have become dramatic, even melodramatic, instead of being picaresque. I also wanted to show that not only were the Indians going to be destroyed, but they were also condemned to live. On the whole, audiences like their entertainment dramatically compact and homogenous, but I want the opposite. A film should remain free and open, not with everything defined and resolved.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Little Big Man&quot; received widespread acclaim from film critics. It was among AFI&#x27;s 400 movies nominated to be on their list of America&#x27;s greatest 100 movies. 

In his December 15, 1970, review, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the movie, &quot;Arthur Penn&#x27;s most extravagant and ambitious movie, an attempt to capture the essence of the American heritage in the funny, bitter, uproarious adventures of Jack Crabb.&quot; Roger Ebert, of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, agreed, giving the film four stars out of four, and describing &quot;Little Big Man&quot; as &quot;an endlessly entertaining attempt to spin an epic in the form of a yarn&quot;. Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;Arthur Penn has made a tangy and, I think, unique film with American verve, about some of the grisly things that American verve has done.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
Chief Dan George was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor in a Supporting Role. He won many honors for his performance, including the National Society of Film Critics Award and the New York Film Critics Circle Award. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actor. Hoffman was nominated as Best Actor by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. The screenplay by Calder Willingham was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award as Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium. The film won a Special Mention at the 7th Moscow International Film Festival in 1971.

In 2014, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

===Legacy===
Arthur Hiller&#x27;s 1984 comedy drama &quot;Teachers&quot; features Richard Mulligan partially reprising his Custer role as Herbert Gower, an outpatient from a mental institution who is accidentally put in charge of a U.S. history class. Gower teaches his pupils while impersonating historical figures, including Custer, but also Abraham Lincoln and Ben Franklin, among others.

Actress Lily Gladstone, who is the first Indigenous person to win a Golden Globe award for acting, has expressed admiration for &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, calling it a &quot;great film&quot;. However, she has also criticized the film&#x27;s casting of Asian actors in Native American roles, which she interpreted as a means of likening the treatment of Indigenous peoples to American involvement in the Vietnam War. &quot;That was absolutely an important talking point,&quot; she has stated, &quot;but it was also Native history being used as a device to talk about something more political.&quot;

==Home media==
, &quot;Little Big Man&quot; has been released worldwide on VHS and DVD, and in the U.S. on a region-free Blu-ray.

== In popular culture ==
The 2023 film &quot;The Holdovers&quot;, which is set in 1970, features a brief scene where &quot;Little Big Man&quot; is shown playing at the Boston Orpheum Theatre. During the scene, protagonist Paul Hunham, a classics professor portrayed by Paul Giamatti, remarks of the film, &quot;You know, this is not only amusing, but for a movie, it&#x27;s a fairly accurate depiction of life among the Cheyenne.&quot;

<text>Meikirch is a municipality in the administrative district of Bern-Mittelland in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

==History==
Meikirch is first mentioned in 1208 as &quot;M√∂nchilcha&quot;.

Evidence of prehistoric settlements in Meikirch include rich Hallstatt sites in Gr√§chwil and a Roman estate with wall paintings in Meikirch. The modern village was first settled and owned by the Monastery of Frienisberg. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the village was owned by the Bernburg family of Bolligen. During the 16th century, it was owned by the hereditary Schultheiss family of Aarberg, the Aebischers. In 1555 the Aebischer family sold the village to the city of Bern.

The village church was first mentioned in 1275, but was built in the 7th and 8th century on top of the ruins of a Roman villa. Portions of the early medieval and medieval churches have been preserved in spite of later alterations. The church tower is from the 12th century. In 1528, after the Protestant Reformation, the church came under the authority of Bern.

After the 1798 French invasion, it became part of the District of Zollikofen. Five years later, after the collapse of the Helvetic Republic, it was placed in the District of Aarberg. The municipality was on the old Bern-Frienisberg-Aarberg road and during the 18th and 19th centuries was part of the postal route between those towns. In 1851-52 a new road was built between Wohlen and Frieswil which bypassed Meikirch. The population began to decline after 1850 and the rate increased after World War I. During this time, the local farms changed from grain farming to cattle and dairy farming, which required fewer people and drove villagers away from Meikirch. The decline stopped with improved transport infrastructure, including the 1948 Postauto route to Bern. The population began to increase when, in 1960, a new road to Bern was completed. The old village houses were rebuilt and the new developments of Sch√ºtzenrain, Weissenstein and Neu-Gr√§chwil were built to provide housing for new residents. The Meikirch secondary school was founded in 1974.

<text>Transmediale, stylised as transmediale, is an annual festival for art and digital culture in Berlin, usually held over three to five days at the end of January and the beginning of February. transmediale takes the form of a conference (sometimes called a festival), an exhibition, and a film and video programme that often contain or support performances and workshops. Throughout the year, transmediale is also involved in a number of long- and short-term cooperative projects. From its initial focus on video culture, it came to cultivate an artistic and critical dialogue with television and multimedia, emerging as the leading international platform for media art. 

The CTM Festival, which began as a part of transmediale, has since become an independent event.

== History ==
transmediale began in 1988 at Berlinale under the name &quot;VideoFilmFest&quot; by founders Hartmut Horst and video artist Micky Kwella. Horst and Kwella wanted to create a platform for electronic media productions, which were, at that time, excluded from classic film festivals such as Berlinale. In 1989, the program was repeated at Berlinale under the name &quot;VideoFest&quot;. In 1997, Horst and Kwella renamed VideoFest as &quot;transmedia&quot;, and then in 1998, &quot;transmediale&quot;. The change reflected the programmatic extension of the festival, which by then encompassed a broad spectrum of multimedia art forms such as Internet and software art. In 1999, club transmediale was founded as a side event.

In 2001, art historian and curator Andreas Broeckmann took over the artistic direction of transmediale, adding events and a new venue, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt. These changes resulted in an increase in attendance and international audience. That same year, Broeckmann introduced the transmediale Award to honour visionary works and projects centering technology-led societies. In 2002, transmediale introduced an extensive media art exhibition. Shortly thereafter, in 2004, the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (German Federal Cultural Foundation) starting funding transmediale. In 2006, the festival&#x27;s subheading changed from &quot;international media art festival&quot; to &quot;festival for art and digital culture&quot; in a marked shift to include art, technology, and everyday life as opposed to its previously narrower focus on media art alone. In 2007, media and arts researcher Stephen Kovats became the artistic director of transmediale and one year later, in 2008, he introduced the Vil√©m Flusser Theory Award, named after Vil√©m Flusser, to promote &quot;outstanding, media-theoretical and research-based artworks&quot;. In April 2011, curator and media researcher Kristoffer Gansing took over transmediale. In 2012, he replaced the existing awards with a residency program for artistic research. In an interview in &quot;Ocula Magazine&quot;, Gansing commented on the changes in direction of transmediale under his leadership: &quot;When I first came on board ... my idea was to bring a curatorial coherency to what I saw as a festival dissipating into a kind of &#x27;creative crowd&#x27; without much focus, so I brought in more exhibitions.&quot;

In 2021, Dr N√≥ra √ì Murch√∫ became the artistic director of transmediale, widening the festival&#x27;s programme to include a notably more diverse programme in terms of scope, content, and curatorial teams (including Ben Evans James, Elise Misao Hunchuck, Lorena Juan, and Dani Admiss in 2021/22, and Ben Evans James, Elise Misao Hunchuck, Lorena Juan, and Bani Brusadin in 2022/23, and Nadim Choufi, Elise Misao Hunchuck, Lorena Juan, and Yasemin Keskintepe in 2023/24). In 2024, Dr N√≥ra √ì Murch√∫ left the festival. Elise Misao Hunchuck and Ben Evans James were invited to be co-curators for the 2025 festival, &quot;(near) near but‚Äîfar&quot;.

== Themes ==

== Organisation ==
Kulturprojekte Berlin was the host organisation of the festival until 2020, at which point the association known as transmediale e.V. took over the independent organisation and management of the event.

In 2011, &quot;transmediale/resource&quot; was established as a framework for transmediale&#x27;s year-round activities. Its aim is to provide a sustainable structure for feedback, research, and reflection beyond the timeframe of the festival. In addition to varying cooperative projects and network activities, &quot;transmediale/resource&quot; includes the Vil√©m Flusser Residency Program for Artistic Research, online publication format transmediale/journal and pre-festival program Vorspiel, presented in collaboration with the CTM Festival and a network of organizations, galleries, independent project spaces, and venues all over Berlin. 

== Places ==
Until 1992, VideoFilmFest took place at MedienOperative as well as Deutsche Akademie der K√ºnste in East Berlin. In 1993, it moved to Podewil, which is also where the transmediale offices have been located from 1997 to 2020. In 2020 the office moved to silent green Kulturquartier, where the festival also opened its own project space &#x27;transmediale studio&#x27;. 

From 2002 to 2005, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt became the festival&#x27;s main location. In 2006, transmediale relocated to Akademie der K√ºnste, returning to the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in 2008. In addition to Haus der Kulturen der Welt, the festival edition 2021‚Äì22 took place in the transmediale studio, Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien and Betonhalle. In 2023, the festival (&quot;a map, a model, a fiction&quot;) and exhibition (&quot;Or So It Seems&quot;) took place in the Akademie der K√ºnste, Hanseatenweg, Berlin, as well as the distributed exhibition (&quot;Out of Scale&quot;) that unfolded in networks (Sp√§tis, eBay Kleinenzeigen, and so on) across the city. In 2024, the festival (&quot;you&#x27;re doing amazing sweetie&quot;) took place in silent green Kulturquartier and Haus der Kulturen der Welt.

<doc id="683511" wikidata="Q58758" url="?curid=683511" title="Hanns Martin Schleyer">
<text>Hans &quot;Hanns&quot;Martin Schleyer (; 1 May 1915 ‚Äì 18 October 1977) was a German business executive, employer and industry representative, Nazi SS-Officer, and lobbyist. He served as president of two powerful commercial organizations: the Confederation of German Employers&#x27; Associations (, BDA) and the Federation of German Industries (, BDI).

Schleyer became a target for radical elements of the West German student movement in the 1970s due to his roles in these business organisations, his positions in labour disputes, his aggressive television appearances, his conservative anti-communist views, his prominence as a member of the Christian Democratic Union, and his past as an enthusiastic member of the Nazi student movement. During the Nazi era, Schleyer served as an SS officer and reached the rank of SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer. Schleyer&#x27;s kidnapping and murder by the Red Army Faction (RAF) during the so-called German Autumn was the climax of one of the most serious crises in the history of West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany).

He was kidnapped on 5 September 1977 by the far left Red Army Faction (, RAF) and subsequently murdered; his driver and police escort of three policemen were also killed when his car was ambushed. The West German government determined that it was in the national interest not to negotiate with terrorists. The abduction and murder are commonly seen as the climax of the RAF campaign in 1977, known as the German Autumn. After his death Schleyer has been extensively honoured in Germany; the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize, the Hanns Martin Schleyer Foundation and the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle are named in his honour. In 2017 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the German government marked the 40th anniversary of the kidnapping.

==Early life==
Born in Offenburg, Grand Duchy of Baden, Hanns Martin Schleyer was the eldest child of Ernst Julius Schleyer (1882‚Äì1959) and Helene Luise Elisabeth Schleyer (&quot;n√©e&quot; Rheitinger; 1883‚Äì1979). His legal name, as shown by his birth certificate, was Hans Martin Schleyer, but Schleyer himself always spelled his first name with two &#x27;n&#x27;s since childhood. His father was a judge and his great-great uncle was Johann Martin Schleyer, a renowned Roman Catholic priest who invented the Volap√ºk language. Schleyer was raised Catholic by his paternal family, which went against the wishes of his irreligious father, who was described as &quot;hot-tempered&quot; and holding national conservative views.

Schleyer finished his &quot;Abitur&quot; in Rastatt and began studying law at the University of Heidelberg in 1933, where he first joined the student fraternity &quot;Teutonia 1842 zu Rastatt&quot; before switching to a year later. In 1939 he obtained a doctorate at the University of Innsbruck.

=== Involvement in the Nazi Party ===
Early in his life, he became a follower of National Socialism. On 1 March 1931, Schleyer became a member of the Hitler Youth, the youth organization of the National Socialist Party. On 1 July 1933, he joined the SS (SS number 221.714), eventually reaching the rank of (Second Lieutenant) in 1945. During his studies, he was engaged in the Nazi student movement. One of his mentors at this time was the student leader Gustav Adolf Scheel. 

In the summer of 1935, Schleyer accused his fraternity of lacking &quot;national socialist spirit&quot;. He left the fraternity when the , an umbrella organization, refused to exclude Jewish members. Schleyer became a leader in the national socialist student movement and, in 1937, joined the NSDAP. At first, he was the president of the student body of the University of Heidelberg. Later, Scheel sent him to post-Anschluss Austria where he occupied the same position at the University of Innsbruck. On 21 October 1939, Schleyer married Waltrude Ketterer (1916‚Äì2008), daughter of the physician, city councillor of Munich and SA- Emil Ketterer. They had four sons.

During World War II, Schleyer was drafted and served on the Western Front from 1939 to 1940 where he participated in the Invasion of France. He was relieved of combat in autumn 1940 when he dislocated both of his arms during a climbing exercise for the upcoming Operation Sea Lion. He was discharged of military duty on 1 May 1941 at Scheel&#x27;s request to return to his position at the University of Innsbruck. He was subsequently sent to Prague, where he was appointed president of the student body at the German campus of Charles University.

In this position, he met Bernhard Adolf, one of the German economic leaders in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, who brought Schleyer to the industrial association of Bohemia and Moravia in 1943. The association was responsible for Aryanization and the procurement of slave laborers. Schleyer became an important deputy and adviser to Bernhard Adolf. Schleyer and his wife were given accommodation in houses seized from Jewish residents during their time in Prague. In 1944, they moved to a seized villa estate in Bubeneƒç, after the previous inhabitant, SA-&quot;Obersturmf√ºhrer&quot; , had committed suicide in wake of the revelation that his son had been an orchestrator in the 20 July assassination plot against Hitler. On 5 May 1945, Schleyer and his family escaped from the city shortly after the start of the Prague uprising.

==Industrial leader in West Germany==
After World War II, Schleyer was arrested by French forces while hiding at his parents&#x27; home in Konstanz and was held as a prisoner of war for three years by the Allies because of his membership in the SS. In his denazification proceeding, Schleyer was initially charged as a &quot;Minderbelasteter&quot;, but he put in an appeal by falsely understating his rank as &quot;Oberscharf√ºhrer&quot; so as to reduce his prospective punishment for which he was instead labelled a &quot;Mitl√§ufer&quot;. He was repatriated in 1948 after paying a fine of 300 Mark.

After working under the French occupation with &quot;Direction des Bases A√©riennes&quot; in Lahr, he became secretary of the chamber of commerce of Baden-Baden shortly after the founding of West Germany. In 1951 Schleyer joined Daimler-Benz, and, with help from a mentor, , eventually became a member of the board of directors. At the end of the 1960s, he was almost appointed chairman of the board, but lost the position to Joachim Zahn. Successively, Schleyer became more involved in employers&#x27; associations, and was a leader in employer and industry associations. He was simultaneously president of the Confederation of German Employers&#x27; Associations (BDA) and the Federation of German Industries (BDI).

His uncompromising acts during industrial protests in the 1960s such as industrial lockouts, his history with the Nazi Party, and his aggressive appearance, especially on TV (&quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as a &quot;caricature of an ugly capitalist&quot;), made Schleyer the ideal enemy for the 1968 student movement. By mid-1977, authorities identified Schleyer as a high risk target in wake of the RAF murders of federal attorney Siegfried Buback, another former Nazi, and bank director representative J√ºrgen Ponto earlier that year.

In 1977 Schleyer debated with Heinz Oskar Vetter, chairman of the Confederation of German Trade Unions in a crosstalk at the 8. St. Gallen Symposium, which later gained a high profile, after Schleyer&#x27;s kidnapping.

==Kidnapping and murder==
On 5 September 1977, a RAF unit &quot;commando Siegfried Hausner&quot;, named after an RAF figure killed during the Stockholm embassy attack two years earlier, attacked the chauffeured car carrying Hanns Martin Schleyer, then president of the German employers&#x27; association, in Cologne, just after the car had turned right from Friedrich Schmidt Strasse into Vincenz-Statz Strasse. His driver was forced to brake when a pram suddenly appeared in the street in front of them. The police escort vehicle behind them was unable to stop in time, and crashed into Schleyer&#x27;s car. Four (or possibly five) masked RAF members then jumped out and sprayed bullets into the two vehicles, killing four members of the convoy. Schleyer was then pulled out of the car and forced into the RAF assailants&#x27; own getaway van. 

The RAF demanded that the West German government release captured members of their organization. After this demand was declined the RAF members were all eventually found dead in their jail cells. After Schleyer&#x27;s kidnappers received the news of the deaths of their imprisoned comrades, Schleyer was taken from Brussels on 18 October 1977, and shot dead en route to Mulhouse, France, where his body was left in the boot of a green Audi 100 on the rue Charles P√©guy.

<text>William DeWitt Mitchell (September 9, 1874August 24, 1955) was an American attorney who had served as both Solicitor General of the United States under President Calvin Coolidge and United States Attorney General under President Herbert Hoover.

==Early life and education==
Mitchell was born in Winona, Minnesota to William B. Mitchell, a Minnesota Supreme Court Justice, and the former Frances Merritt. Mitchell received his early schooling in Winona and the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey before enrolling in at Yale University in 1891. Though he originally entered Yale with an interest in electrical engineering, after two years his focus shifted to law and he subsequently transferred to the University of Minnesota. To make up for lost time, Mitchell simultaneously took law courses at night while finishing his undergraduate degree.

Mitchell graduated from the University of Minnesota with an A.B. degree in 1895, and subsequently enrolled at the University of Minnesota Law School, where he received his LL.B. degree in 1896. Shortly after graduating from law school, Mitchell was admitted to the Minnesota State Bar Association and practiced law in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He married the former Gertrude Bancroft on June 27, 1901. They had two sons which were William and Bancroft Mitchell.

==Career==

He formed the law firm of &quot;How, Taylor &amp; Mitchell&quot;, which became prominent in the Midwest. This prestige allowed Mitchell access to both the regional council of the U.S. Railroad Administration in 1919, and then he served as chairman of the Citizens Charter Committee of St. Paul in 1922.

===Military service===
He served as a line officer with the 15th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment and later an acting judge advocate for the United States Second Army Corps during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. From 1899 to 1901 he was an engineer officer for the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division and later adjutant for the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Minnesota Army National Guard. During the First World War he served with the 6th Infantry Regiment of the Minnesota Army National Guard and later served at Camp Taylor, Kentucky until the war was over. He reached the rank of Colonel.

===Government service===
His combined military service placed him in position to be appointed to the position of Solicitor General of the United States. Having served well in his position, President Hoover appointed him Attorney General of the United States from March 4, 1929, and he held that office until March 4, 1933, one of his principal acts having been to order the Bonus Army dispersed and their camp destroyed.

==Later career==
Mitchell then settled in New York City where he practiced law. He was named chairman of the &quot;Committee on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&quot;, and chief counsel of the joint congressional committee investigating the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Mitchell died there in Syosset, New York on August 24, 1955, at the age of 80.

<doc id="683531" wikidata="Q5774670" url="?curid=683531" title="History Bites">
<text>History Bites is a television series on History Television that ran from 1998 to 2004. It was a prime-time program. Created by Rick Green, &quot;History Bites&quot; explored what would be on television if the medium had been around for the last 5,000 years of human history.

Typically, a significant historical event was chosen and mock news, sports and entertainment programming was created around it. Each episode included several segments of Green offering historical background of the episode&#x27;s chosen era and otherwise showed frequent shifts from one comedy sketch to another (as well as returning to certain sketches repeatedly) representing a channel-surfing viewer who never watched any one sketch for more than a few minutes at a time. Furthermore, the theme of the series is about debunking misplaced nostalgia about historical periods by illustrating their often absurd injustices and brutal realities to modern sensibilities.

==Synopsis==
Contemporary movies, television shows and personalities (Martha Stewart, Don Cherry, Tom Brokaw, Dennis Miller, Larry King and Andy Rooney, among others) were comically adapted to the chosen era. For example, the legendary revenge story of the &quot;47 Ronin&quot; of early 18th-century Japan was told in the style of a made-for-TV movie modelled on the real-life film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Television sitcoms such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot; were also frequently parodied, with the characters commenting on time-appropriate events, be it Joan of Arc or the benefits of joining the elite Persian Immortals. Game and reality shows were parodied as well, including a depiction of the Donner Party as participants in an 1846 version of &quot;Survivor&quot;, and almost every episode featured segments that parodied &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; and/or &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, in which contestants answered trivia questions about the common beliefs of the featured era. Anachronisms were frequent and deliberate, adding to the show&#x27;s distinctive humour. For example, in one episode set in AD 100 and focusing on gladiatorial combat, the &quot;Zamboni family&quot; was responsible for tidying the Colosseum between bouts, in reference to modern Zamboni machines that repair rink surfaces during intermissions at ice hockey games.

By far, the earliest setting for an episode has been 6000 BC, in which viewers were advised on pre-monotheism ritual as well as the new technologies of agriculture, the bow and arrow and house-building. It also included a parody of a hospital show in which the treatment for every ailment was a trepanation. The most recent setting was 1881, in an episode largely about &quot;The Shootout At Fly&#x27;s Photographic Studio&quot;, a historically more accurate description of the event commonly known as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

The show&#x27;s production values improved over the five seasons, increasing and refining the use of sets, costumes and props. &quot;Never Lost&quot; was Green&#x27;s message (stated explicitly in the first episode and alluded to in the closing of each episode) that fond nostalgia is misplaced and that the lives of our ancestors were rife with oppression, ignorance (including casually held antisemitic and/or racist beliefs), disease and suffering. Ultimately, the title &quot;History Bites&quot; has a double meaning, referring to the &quot;soundbites&quot;-like nature of the short clips from each sketch, as well as the often brutal and unpleasant nature of the history being satirized.

==Episodes==

<doc id="683546" wikidata="Q1929664" url="?curid=683546" title="Michael Vaughan">
<text>Michael Paul Vaughan (born 29 October 1974) is an English cricket commentator and former cricketer who played all forms of the game. He served as England captain for the test team from 2003 to 2008, the one-day international team from 2003 to 2007, and was the first Twenty20 England captain from 2005 to 2007. He represented Yorkshire in the domestic arena.

Vaughan was a right-handed opening batter, who forged a successful England partnership with Marcus Trescothick, though he often batted in the middle order for England. He was ranked one of the best batters in the world following the 2002/03 Ashes, in which he scored 633 runs, including three centuries.

Vaughan captained England in 51 Tests, winning 26 (a then-national record) and losing 11; England won all seven home Tests of the 2004 summer under Vaughan, and the pinnacle of his captaincy career came with a 2‚Äì1 victory in the 2005 Ashes, England&#x27;s first Ashes victory in 18 years (since 1986/87). However, a recurring knee injury, his decision to move down the batting order to accommodate other opening batsmen (Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook) and the pressures of captaincy took their toll on Vaughan&#x27;s batting during the latter part of his career: in Tests, he averaged 50.95 when not captain, and 36.02 as captain. Vaughan announced his retirement from first-class cricket on 30 June 2009.

==Early life==
Michael Paul Vaughan was born in Eccles, Greater Manchester the younger son of Graham and Dee Vaughan, and a great-great-nephew of the early 20th century Lancashire and England cricketers Ernest and Johnny Tyldesley.

The family moved to Sheffield, when he was nine. His father, an engineer, had captained the Worsley third XI, and Vaughan says &quot;My first memory of cricket is when I was 10 years old, hitting balls on the boundary while my dad was playing for Worsley in the Manchester Association League.&quot; However, it was his brother David (currently working as an estate agent), older by two years, who got him into the game.

He attended Silverdale School, and was enthusiastic about football, later reflecting, &quot;I&#x27;d have probably preferred to be a footballer if I could have been good enough. But my knees would never have lasted.&quot; Despite his many commitments, he has been a regular supporter of Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

As a youngster he played alongside future England international footballer and Manchester United captain Gary Neville, himself a talented youth cricketer, during the Bunbury Cricket Festival.

Vaughan started playing cricket for the school side and it was here he first caught the eye of Doug Padgett, the Yorkshire coach. He also started playing club cricket for Sheffield Collegiate Cricket Club at Abbeydale Park in Sheffield.

==Personal life==
Vaughan married Nichola Shannon (a native of Northern Ireland) on 27 September 2003. The couple have three children.

In 2005 he moved from Dore in Sheffield to Baslow in Derbyshire.

In 2006, he bought a house valued at ¬£1 million on a luxury golf course development in Barbados and another on Isla Margarita. In 2012, Vaughan carried the Olympic Torch through Hillingdon for the London Olympic Games on 24 July.

Vaughan is a second cousin of the actress Catherine Tyldesley, known for her role as Eva Price in the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. 

Vaughan stated he would be voting Conservative in 2015 and expressed dissatisfaction about the way in which the Labour Party acted after the 2017 general election.

==County career==

Vaughan, then living in Derbyshire, turned up as a child to watch Yorkshire playing at Sheffield. During the tea break, he was playing on the outfield with his friends when (then) Yorkshire head coach Doug Padgett spotted him, and approached him about joining the county.

However, Vaughan was born in Eccles, Greater Manchester, and at the time Yorkshire had a strict policy of only picking players who were born in Yorkshire. Years later, when the rule was removed, Doug Padgett re-investigated the young player, and offered him a place at the Yorkshire academy.

==International career==
===1993‚Äì2003===
A batsman and occasional off spinner, Vaughan began playing professional cricket aged 17, and captained the England Under-19 cricket team on tour against Sri Lanka in 1993/94 and at home against India in 1994. He made his Test debut for England in South Africa in November 1999, becoming the 600th player to represent his country at Test cricket. He came to the crease for his first Test innings with England in the perilous state of two wickets down for two runs; within an over this had become four wickets down for two runs. He made a composed 33, and shared a partnership of 56 with Andrew Flintoff.

In May 2001 he scored his first Test century against Pakistan at Old Trafford. In December 2001, in Bangalore, Vaughan became the second Englishman, after Graham Gooch, and the 7th and most recent player in Test match history, to be given out handled the ball in Tests: on 64, he brushed away a ball from Sarandeep Singh, and was given out on appeal.

In 2002, Vaughan scored 900 runs in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India. This included 115 against Sri Lanka at Lord&#x27;s during the first Test. During the series against India he scored a duck and 100 during the first Test at Lord&#x27;s, and his highest innings score to date of 197 against India during the second Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham where he also took 3 wickets including the prized scalp of Sachin Tendulkar and during the fourth Test he scored 195 against India, again falling just short of a double-century. Later that year the English cricket team travelled to Australia for the 2002‚Äì03 Ashes series. It was here that Vaughan&#x27;s career seemed to launch.

He started poorly in the first Test at Brisbane with scores of 33 and 0, but in the second Test in Adelaide he would improve on this with 177 and 41. During the fourth Test at Melbourne he made an aggressive 145. In the fifth and final Test at Sydney, Vaughan scored a match-winning 183 before being given out (wrongfully) lbw to Andy Bichel, as replays showed that not only was the ball missing leg stump but it was going over the stumps by a fair margin.

He became the first visiting batsman for 32 years to score over 600 runs in a Test match series in Australia and the first Englishman to make 3 Test hundreds in a series against Australia since Chris Broad. In total, he scored 1,481 Test runs in 2002, at the time the second highest for a calendar year in Test history after Viv Richards&#x27;s 1,710 in 1976, although as of 2010 Vaughan&#x27;s total has been exceeded another five times. This run of form made Vaughan the number one batsman in the world according to the ICC rankings, the first Englishman to achieve this since Graham Gooch.

Vaughan followed with a 156 against South Africa at Edgbaston in 2003. He was appointed Test captain in the next match, after Nasser Hussain stepped down. At the point at which he took over the England captaincy, Vaughan had a Test batting average of 50.98.

===England captaincy===
Vaughan&#x27;s limited-overs batting rarely lived up to his success in Tests: indeed, despite a total of 86 matches played, he never made a One Day International century. His highest ODI score is 90 not out, which he made off 99 balls against Zimbabwe.

Despite this, on 6 May 2003, Vaughan was appointed captain of the England One Day International team, Nasser Hussain choosing to step down after the 2003 World Cup.

In July, he also took over from Hussain the captaincy of the Test side. He suddenly became captain of the England Test team on 28 July 2003, after scoring 156 in the first Test against South Africa, when Nasser Hussain resigned after England had drawn the game. The England team lost his first Test in charge by an innings and 92 runs, but went on to level the series in the next game. The series ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw.

Vaughan&#x27;s batting initially suffered under the increased pressures of captaincy; in his first twelve matches as captain, his batting average was only 30.31. However, under Vaughan&#x27;s captaincy, the England side became one of the most successful sides in world cricket. He benefited from the revolution begun by coach Duncan Fletcher and former captain Nasser Hussain, such as the awarding of central contracts to the core England players, and continued to forge a winning team.

In 2003, after the drawn series against South Africa, England toured the Indian subcontinent, beating Bangladesh but losing to Sri Lanka. In 2004, England were unbeaten, winning eleven matches and drawing two, including an England record of eight consecutive victories. They beat the West Indies away for the first time since 1968. They then won all seven home Tests against New Zealand and the West Indies, before beating South Africa away for the first time since 1965. In the 2005 home season, England easily beat Bangladesh in a two-Test series, before facing Australia for the Ashes.

Following a series defeat to South Africa, Vaughan stepped down as England captain on 3 August 2008 before the final Test at the Oval. In a highly emotional speech, Vaughan thanked those closest to him for their support and, amidst a flood of tears, asked if anyone present had a tissue.

===Ashes 2005===
Hopes were high for the Ashes after the success of the previous eighteen months, but expectations were moderated by the knowledge that Australia had been the best team in the world for many years. Australian captain Ricky Ponting called for a catching pact, where batsmen would accept the word of fielders as to whether they were caught, but this was rejected by Vaughan who preferred to leave it to the umpires.

The build-up was long and intense, with press speculation over the ability of many players, leading Vaughan to say: &quot;Both sets of players are sick and tired of talking about the Ashes. We&#x27;ve got a young group of players who are excited by the challenge, and it&#x27;s a challenge we are all looking forward to.&quot;

In the first Test, at Lord&#x27;s, England were easily beaten; Vaughan performed very poorly scoring only 3 and 4. Analysis of Vaughan&#x27;s batting showed that over the last 30 months he had averaged only 37.77, and lacked consistency with a poor defensive technique. Despite his lack of form, he turned down the opportunity of playing county cricket for Yorkshire against Derbyshire, preferring to work in the nets with Duncan Fletcher. He returned, however, for their match against Kent, making 116 not out, and taking 2/42. He captained England to a narrow two-run victory in the second Test to level the series, but again scored poorly with only 24 and 1.

By the third Test, Vaughan&#x27;s poor run of form was attracting increasing criticism. But during the third Test at Old Trafford he answered the critics, albeit with a bit of luck during a Glenn McGrath over. In the second ball of the over, when Vaughan was on 41, he cut hard at a wide delivery from McGrath and Gilchrist allowed it to slip through his gloves and run away for four runs. The very next ball McGrath clean bowled Vaughan with a superb off cutter, but this was in vain as the umpire called a no-ball for overstepping the line. Vaughan went on to strike 166, punishing in particular the lacklustre bowling of Jason Gillespie. Vaughan was eventually caught by Glenn McGrath off a full-toss delivery from occasional slow left-armer Simon Katich.

However, his opposing captain, Ponting, was equal to the task and made 156 as Australia clung on for the draw. Vaughan made 58 in the first innings of the fourth Test, but was out for a duck in the second, as England struggled in reaching their target of 129, eventually reaching it with three wickets to spare.

In the fifth Test, he scored 11 and 45, as it ended in a draw, allowing England to claim the Ashes for the first time since Mike Gatting&#x27;s side in the 1986‚Äì87 series in Australia.

The England team were widely lauded after winning the Ashes. Tens of thousands of people lined the route of their open-top bus parade through London, with around 25,000 gathering in Trafalgar Square, their final destination.

Vaughan was given the freedom of his home city of Sheffield in honour of his achievements. In the New Year Honours, Vaughan became an OBE for his successful captaincy; the rest of the side were appointed MBEs.

===Injury troubles===

A knee injury ruled Vaughan out of the first Test of England&#x27;s tour of Pakistan in late 2005. He played in the next two, scoring a half-century in the third, as England lost the series 2‚Äì0. This broke England&#x27;s unbeaten run of six consecutive Test series, which had taken them to second in the ICC Test Championship.

Vaughan missed almost the entire 2006 season due to injuries related to his knee; he was unable to play Test series against India and Sri Lanka. Although initially hopeful of a return, he was also unfit to play in the 2006/07 Ashes series in Australia, which England lost 5‚Äì0. On 9 January 2007, Vaughan made his first international appearance in over a year, captaining England to defeat in a Twenty20 match against Australia, despite scoring 27 off 21 balls. He captained England for the first two ODIs of 2006‚Äì07 Commonwealth Bank Series, a defeat to Australia and a victory over New Zealand, before a torn hamstring forced him to miss the next five games. He returned on 6 February 2007, leading England into the finals with a 14-run victory over New Zealand, although Vaughan was out for a golden duck. Two days later, he was forced to miss the best-of-three finals and return to England, after aggravating the same hamstring injury.

In October, Vaughan signed a rolling contract with Yorkshire intended to keep him at the club for the remainder of his career; the deal would only take effect after his central contract with England ended.

===World Cup 2007===
Despite injury concerns, on 14 February 2007, Vaughan was selected in the final 15 for the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the Caribbean, and confirmed as captain. He captained the team through Group C with victories over Canada and Kenya and a defeat to New Zealand, scoring 45, 1 and 26.

During the Super Eight stage of the tournament, Vaughan produced a series of poor innings as England continued to underperform; they were knocked out with one match remaining having never looked convincing. After their penultimate match, in which they were soundly beaten by South Africa, Vaughan said &quot;It&#x27;s a very sad day for English cricket. It&#x27;s a horrible feeling to walk off and be booed by a lot of English supporters, and rightfully so from the performance we put in. I fully expected us to turn up and produce something, but we didn&#x27;t and we have to accept all the criticism that comes our way.&quot; In the Guardian, Mike Selvey said Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;selection without proof of form or fitness was a gamble and it has failed.&quot; Former England cricketer Bob Willis called for Vaughan to be axed as captain.

In England&#x27;s final game against the West Indies, Vaughan was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 3/39 from 10 overs, and scored a quick-fire 79 off 68 as England achieved a narrow victory with just one wicket and one ball remaining.

===2007 season===
After being released for county action on his return, Vaughan found form with 72 for Yorkshire against Hampshire at the Rose Bowl. However, in the second innings of that match he was again injured; this time with a broken finger, received as he tried to evade a Stuart Clark delivery. This ruled him out of the first Test against the West Indies on 17 May.

He recovered for the second test, his first for 18 months, and scored 103 in an emphatic victory of an innings and 283 runs; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Selvey described the innings as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, and said &quot;Vaughan came as close to perfection as ever he can have done.&quot;

When England defeated the West Indies in the third Test at Old Trafford, Vaughan surpassed Peter May as the man who had led England to most Test victories, with 21 wins.

Despite this, at the end of the 4th day of the fourth test, it was announced that Vaughan would be standing down as captain of the one-day team with immediate effect.

On 30 July, against India Vaughan hit his 5,000th Test cricket run at Trent Bridge, and eventually fell to an unlucky dismissal off the thigh pad for 124. On 15 September, Vaughan top-scored for Yorkshire Phoenix with 95 runs against Derbyshire Phantoms (his highest one-day score in two years), thus firing them to victory in the county&#x27;s last Pro40 match of the season.

For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.

===Sri Lanka and New Zealand===
Vaughan failed to make a significant score in Sri Lanka as he opened for England with Cook. He travelled to New Zealand with great optimism. However, in the 3 match Test series, he again failed to make an impact, scoring a gritty 63 in the first Test defeat and averaging 20.05. Nevertheless, he did lead England to a first away series win in 3 years. There were many calls for Vaughan&#x27;s place in the side to be reassessed, nothing in Vaughan&#x27;s 135 from six domestic innings in 2008 to quieten them. He acknowledged his need for runs, but remained upbeat about his own position and about England&#x27;s chances in the 2009 Ashes series.

Jonathan Agnew opined that Vaughan could ill afford another poor series. He answered his critics in the first test, however, scoring his eighteenth century when he hit 106 from 214 deliveries. This was his first century against New Zealand, and his sixth at Lord&#x27;s, the latter equalling the record set by Graham Gooch.

===South Africa===
Following his century in the first Test of the summer against New Zealand, Vaughan again struggled with form in the second series of the summer against South Africa, scoring just 2, 0 and 21 in the first two Test matches of the series. With the team also performing poorly and with questions being raised over selection issues,

Vaughan again came under pressure going into the third Test at Edgbaston. He scored a golden duck as the team capitulated to 231 all out on the first day of the test. This led to much criticism from the media, particularly Geoffrey Boycott, who stated on Test Match Special, &quot;On his performances he doesn&#x27;t deserve to play¬†... Vaughan, I&#x27;ve said for a long time, is not playing well¬†... There&#x27;s something wrong ‚Äì I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s his eyesight or what&quot;. After defeat at Edgbaston, which meant that England would lose the series, Vaughan stepped down as England captain after five years in charge due to the team&#x27;s recent lack of wins.

=== Retirement ===
Vaughan continued his poor form through 2009 and could not earn himself a recall to the national team in time for the West Indies tour.

In January, Vaughan had withdrawn from the IPL auction to concentrate on getting back into the Test side in time for the Ashes, but to no avail: his poor form seemed to have brought an end to his international career as he was not included in the training party for the Ashes Tests. Mike Atherton, also a former England captain and now cricket correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, suggested that, based on the vibes emanating from Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Vaughan was not about to quit. Vaughan&#x27;s future was not necessarily in his own hands. In seven County Championship matches in 2009, he had scored just 147 runs at an average of 21.00, by some way the lowest of Yorkshire&#x27;s top-order batsmen. His last innings of 47 versus Worcestershire was his highest for Yorkshire since June 2008, and he had not hit a century since May 2002. In all, since the 2005 Ashes, he had rolled up a mere 747 Yorkshire runs at 25.75. &quot;Does he still justify a place in Yorkshire&#x27;s Championship side?&quot; asked the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;. A few days later, on 30 June 2009, Vaughan ended all speculation by announcing his retirement from all cricket with immediate effect. The announcement, made at Edgbaston, home to Warwickshire County Cricket Club, was made after his being omitted from the England Ashes squad. He gave a tongue-in-cheek explanation for his retirement, stating: &quot;Two weeks ago my little lad, Archie, bowled a ball that hit a weed and knocked my off-stump out of the ground. If a three-year-old is bowling me out, it&#x27;s time to move over!&quot;

Not only is Vaughan involved in broadcasting he also has a large range of business interests outside cricket. Some of these involve Fitness with a gym called FITISM based in both Bakewell and now Wilmslow. Vaughan also has an art company called Art Balling where he paints pictures by hitting cricket balls at a wall.

Since his retirement, Vaughan has at various times been a brand ambassador for a range of companies. Most recently, he has been associated with menswear company Charles Tyrwhitt.

==Allegations of racism ==
Following an investigation into racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club, on 4 November 2021 Vaughan announced he had been named in a report dealing with claims of institutionalised racism at the club by former player Azeem Rafiq. He confirmed that his name appears in the report into Rafiq&#x27;s account of racial discrimination, harassment and bullying during his time at Yorkshire in his column in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. He denied the claim. On 5 November, the BBC announced that Vaughan would not present his Radio 5 Live show the following week, due to the investigation, but were still in discussions with his team over his future with the corporation. In March 2023, Vaughan was cleared on the balance of probabilities of making racist remarks towards Rafiq. 

==Broadcasting==
In 2009 Vaughan joined Test Match Special as an expert summariser during the England vs Australia ODI series. His first Test match was during England&#x27;s series in South Africa.

He appeared on the Sport Panel Show &quot;Fighting Talk&quot; on BBC Radio 5 Live. Vaughan is also a commentator on Channel Five&#x27;s Cricket on Five television highlights package from the 2010 season. He also took part in the 2011 TV series Jamie&#x27;s Dream School. Since 2012 Vaughan has also worked as an interviewer for BBC&#x27;s golf coverage. In 2012, Depression in Cricket, on BBC Radio 5 live presented by Vaughan won the Sports Journalists&#x27; Association&#x27;s Award for Best Radio Programme. The programme, broadcast in June 2011, featured interviews with Marcus Trescothick, Matthew Hoggard and Kevin Saxelby, whose brother, Mark, committed suicide in 2000.

On 21 June 2012, Vaughan was the first celebrity to be revealed in the line up of the tenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, and was voted off the show on 2 December 2012.
During the 2017‚Äì18 Ashes Series he was an expert commentator on the BT Sport&#x27;s coverage and an occasional host of The Cricket Show with Australian Michael Slater and then he was guest commentator on the Network Ten&#x27;s coverage of 2017‚Äì18 Big Bash League season. 

In January 2018, Vaughan participated in And They&#x27;re Off! in aid of Sport Relief.

In 2018, Vaughan joined Fox Sports Australia as an expert commentator for the Australian test summer.

==Awards==
Vaughan was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2003 and became the first cricketer ever to be featured on the cover of cricket&#x27;s Bible Wisden (in the same year) after his excellent batting in 2002. In August 2005, the Sheffield Hallam University honoured him with an honorary doctorate for his services towards the game. September 2005 saw him being awarded the Freedom of the City of Sheffield after captaining England to victory in the Ashes.

In December 2005, the England cricket team was awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award. Vaughan was nominated for the Sports Personality of the Year individual award, but that went to his teammate, Andrew Flintoff.

On 31 December 2005, the entire Ashes-winning England cricket team was awarded the Queen&#x27;s New Years&#x27; Honours, with Vaughan, team coach Duncan Fletcher and manager Phil Neale being honoured with OBEs and the rest of the side being awarded MBEs.

Vaughan was also nominated in the Captain of the Year category for the 2006 ICC Awards (eventually awarded to Sri Lanka&#x27;s Mahela Jayawardene) which was held in Mumbai on 3 November 2006. The following year, Vaughan was named in the Test Team of the Year at the 2007 ICC Awards.

==Writing==
Vaughan has written three books related to his cricketing career: &quot;A Year in the Sun: The Captain&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;Calling The Shots&quot; and &quot;Time To Declare&quot;.

Vaughan&#x27;s first book was titled &quot;A Year in the Sun: The Captain&#x27;s Story&quot;. In this book, he describes his phenomenal and fortuitous year of 2002‚Äì03, experiencing Bradmanesque-form, plundering seven centuries in 12 Tests, en route to become the world&#x27;s best Test batsman that year. He also describes his experiences as an England cricketer, bowling out Sachin Tendulkar (one of the finest players in the modern game) and the controversial World Cup in Zimbabwe, which led to England forfeiting important points and eventually any chance they had of winning. Vaughan&#x27;s appointment as England captain after the 2003 World Cup brought a new fresh spirit and life in the England dressing room, leading to instant success in the one-day arena. Nasser Hussain resigned as England Test captain shortly after ‚Äì and Vaughan took charge in Tests as well.

In October 2005, Vaughan released &quot;Calling The Shots&quot;, which describes man-management of the team as captain and his time as the England cricket captain so far. It also describes his fractious relationship with the South African captain Graeme Smith. Vaughan alleged that Smith had called him [Vaughan] a &quot;queer&quot; and Andrew Flintoff a &quot;big baby&quot;. Moreover, Smith acted as a witness during the trial of Vaughan&#x27;s case with match-referee Clive Lloyd, where Vaughan had mildly rebuked the umpires for having called off play in bright conditions the previous day during a Test match in Johannesburg, South Africa, which resulted in Vaughan being fined his entire match-fee. Afterwards he started referring to Smith as &#x27;The Witness&#x27;. 

Vaughan released his book &quot;Time To Declare&quot; after announcing his retirement from all forms of cricket in 2009. This book talks about his early days as a Yorkshire cricketer, to emerging as a world-class batsman, forging a successful partnership with then coach Duncan Fletcher that finally culminated in England winning the Ashes in 2005, to becoming the most successful England cricket captain in history, and finally, recurring injuries which ultimately caused him to end his playing career.

He gives an insight about captaining and working with different personalities such as Flintoff, Kevin Pietersen and Steve Harmison, all of whom were instrumental in England winning the 2005 Ashes. He also gives his views on the state of cricket today and a frank assessment of fellow players, coaches and administrators. The book concludes with praise for the achievements of the 2009 Ashes-winning England team.

<text>The dB&#x27;s are an American alternative rock and power pop group, who formed in New York City in 1978 and first came to prominence in the early 1980s.
Their debut album &quot;Stands for Decibels&quot; is acclaimed as one of the great &quot;lost&quot; power pop albums of the 1980s.

The band members are Peter Holsapple, Chris Stamey, Will Rigby, and Gene Holder. Although the members are all from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the group was formed in New York City in 1978. In 2012, the band completed its first new studio album in 25 years and its first in 30 years with the original lineup.

==History==
During 1977, Stamey played bass with Alex Chilton in New York, and recorded &quot;(I Thought) You Wanted to Know&quot; with Television guitarist Richard Lloyd. A single of the latter song, backed with &quot;If and When&quot; (on which Rigby and Holder played), was issued in 1978, credited to Chris Stamey and the dB&#x27;s.

Holsapple joined the group in October 1978, after moving to New York City from North Carolina. Their single &quot;Black and White&quot; was issued by Shake Records in 1980. 

British label Albion Records released their first album &quot;Stands for Decibels&quot; in January 1981 to critical acclaim but negligible sales.

According to &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, the group drew from 1960s pop and psychedelia as well as 1970s pop groups like Big Star, but the songs by composers Stamey and Holsapple were too distinctive to merely copy their sources of inspiration. While Holsapple was skilled in the composing of fairly conventional tunes such as &quot;Big Brown Eyes&quot; and &quot;Bad Reputation,&quot; Stamey&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Espionage&quot; and &quot;Tearjerkin&#x27;,&quot; tended to be somewhat more experimental and quirky.

They released a second album on Albion in 1981, &quot;Repercussion&quot;, and also released singles such as &quot;Judy.&quot; These two albums were later reissued on one compact disc.

Stamey left the group after the second album, and pursued a career as a solo artist and producer. The group then recorded the album &quot;Like This&quot;, released in 1984. The band signed an American record deal with Bearsville Records, but distribution problems caused the album to be delayed, and Bearsville folded the same year. Rick Wagner joined the band on bass, and Holder moved to lead guitar.

&quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, their last album before their breakup, was released on I.R.S. Records in 1987 with New Orleans bass player Jeff Beninato, founder of the New Orleans Musicians Relief Fund. The album reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 171. Beninato participated in the subsequent tour. Holder left the band to join the Individuals, and Eric Peterson was recruited on lead guitar after replacing temporary guitarist/keyboardist Harold Kelt. &quot;[&quot;The Sound of Music&quot;] has been out of print since 1988,&quot; said Peter Holsapple in 2022. &quot;I.R.S. then rejected all the demos for a second album on the label, and I ended the band after a show in Florida.&quot; In 2017, Holsapple said: &quot;Somehow we&#x27;ve gone from great white hope to also-ran to godfathers of power pop, all without selling a whole lot of records. There were some cities where we felt like we were kind of a big deal. In Chicago we got a lot of radio play on WXRT and we could sell out the clubs there, but take us to Bloomington, Indiana, and nobody knew who we were.&quot;

Several albums were released after the dB&#x27;s broke up. Line Records compiled &quot;Stands for Decibels&quot; and &quot;Repercussion&quot; with the addition of two bonus tracks, first in 1992 as &quot;dB&#x27;s First/ Repercussion&quot;, then in 1999 as &quot;Neverland&quot;. &quot;Ride the Wild Tom-Tom&quot;, released in 1993 by Rhino Records, collected demos, early recordings, and singles. &quot;Paris Avenue&quot;, issued in 1994 by Monkey Hill Records, was a posthumous album by the final line-up, based on demo tapes from the band&#x27;s waning days.

==Other projects==
Following the dB&#x27;s breakup, Holsapple worked as a sideman, serving as a full-time auxiliary guitarist and keyboardist for R.E.M. for four years, beginning with the &quot;Green&quot; world tour and continuing through the 1991 &quot;Out of Time&quot; album. After finishing working with R.E.M., he toured with Hootie and the Blowfish and then joined the Continental Drifters. He released one solo album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Out of My Way&quot;.

Stamey has released six solo records and has worked as a record producer. In 1985, the &quot;Christmas Time&quot; holiday-themed mini-album was issued by Coyote Records, credited to &quot;Chris Stamey Group with Special Guests the dB&#x27;s&quot;. It was expanded to a 17-song CD in 1993, retitled &quot;Christmas Time Again&quot; and featuring contributions from Mitch Easter, Ryan Adams, Marshall Crenshaw, Don Dixon, and others, and then again as a 21-song CD in November 2006.

Rigby played drums for Steve Earle and others, and Holder continued to record and produce. 

In 1991, Stamey and Holsapple reunited (not under the dB&#x27;s moniker) as a duo to record an album titled &quot;Mavericks&quot;.

==Reunion==
The classic lineup of the dB&#x27;s reunited in 2005 and performed two shows in Chicago and two in Hoboken, New Jersey.

Also in 2005, the band recorded a cover version of the 1966 song &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot; to benefit the New Orleans Musicians&#x27; Relief Fund.

Bowery Ballroom in NYC hosted the dB&#x27;s in January 2007, and in February 2007, the band performed at Cat&#x27;s Cradle in Carrboro, North Carolina.

In March 2012, Holsapple, Stamey, Rigby, and Mitch Easter (substituting for Holder) played at South by Southwest.

&quot;Falling Off the Sky&quot; was released in June 2012 by Bar/None Records.

<text>M√ºnsingen (; ) is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. On 1 January 2013 the former municipality of Trimstein merged into M√ºnsingen, and on 1 January 2017 the former municipality of T√§gertschi also merged.

The village lies on the River Aare between the cities of Bern and Thun.

==History==
M√ºnsingen developed from a Celtic village first settled in around 400 BC. The origin of the name is unclear, though attributed to the Alamanni. During the early and middle La Tene era the residents of the village built about 220 tombs along the Aare river. Some of the men were buried with their weapons and the women and children were buried with jewelry. A total of 1,200 items were discovered from the village. The rich collection of artifacts and the clear stratigraphic layers at M√ºnsingen have helped archeologists to develop a model for dating isolated graves from Germany to Romania to Italy. The relatively small number of individuals combined with the rich grave goods indicate that the settlement at M√ºnsingen was home to Celtic nobility. Two of the graves contain skulls that show evidence of trepanation or holes bored into the skull.

During the Roman era there was a country estate or very small settlement near where the village church stands today. Scattered fragments of a wall and a bath house have been discovered. The bath house floor was decorated with mosaics depicting fishes and the god Oceanus. The bath house is probably from the 2nd century AD.

M√ºnsingen is first mentioned between 993 and 1010 as &quot;Munisingam&quot; when King Rudolph III of Burgundy granted it to Count Kuno. It passed through the hands of the Kyburgs and the Z√§hringens. Then, in the 13th and 14th centuries M√ºnsingen came under the lordship of the Senn knights from whom the present arms of the municipality are derived. In 1377, the last member of the family sold the town to a wealthy family in Bern. It passed through several families before the city of Bern gradually acquired all the rights to the town.

As an important gathering-place during the Peasants&#x27; War, and in the ensuing process of democratization, M√ºnsingen played a major part in the history of the canton of Bern.

Originally, the town was ruled from a castle located on the heights above the M√ºli valley. However, this building fell into ruin and little is known about it. By the 12th century another castle was built in M√ºnsingen town. The Senn family ruled the town from this castle. However, it was demolished by Bern in 1311. A wooden outbuilding was built on the castle lands three years later, in 1314. In 1550 the Schultheiss Hans Franz N√§geli rebuilt the castle building into M√ºnsingen Castle. It was renovated and repaired in 1749‚Äì53. In 1977 the municipality acquired the castle and converted it into a municipal museum. The wooden outbuilding was rebuilt in 1570 into a country estate house by the Schultheiss Johannes Steiger. It was purchased in 1877 by the Canton of Bern and converted into a cantonal psychiatric clinic. The clinic played an important role in the 1930s in introducing the somatic therapies in psychiatry.

<doc id="683561" wikidata="Q1936288" url="?curid=683561" title="Total variation">
<text>In mathematics, the total variation identifies several slightly different concepts, related to the (local or global) structure of the codomain of a function or a measure. For a real-valued continuous function &quot;f&quot;, defined on an interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] ‚äÇ R, its total variation on the interval of definition is a measure of the one-dimensional arclength of the curve with parametric equation &quot;x&quot; ‚Ü¶ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), for &quot;x&quot; ‚àà [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. Functions whose total variation is finite are called &quot;functions of bounded variation&quot;.

==Historical note==
The concept of total variation for functions of one real variable was first introduced by Camille Jordan in the paper . He used the new concept in order to prove a convergence theorem for Fourier series of discontinuous periodic functions whose variation is bounded. The extension of the concept to functions of more than one variable however is not simple for various reasons.

==Definitions==

===Total variation for functions of one real variable===
 The total variation of a real-valued (or more generally complex-valued) function formula_1, defined on an interval formula_2 is the quantity

:formula_3

where the supremum runs over the set of all partitions formula_4 of the given interval. Which means that formula_5.

===Total variation for functions of &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 real variables ===

&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1093/oso/9780198502456.001.0001&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Let Œ© be an open subset of R&quot;n&quot;. Given a function &quot;f&quot; belonging to &quot;L&quot;1(Œ©), the total variation of &quot;f&quot; in Œ© is defined as

:formula_6

where 
* formula_7 is the set of continuously differentiable vector functions of compact support contained in formula_8, 
* formula_9 is the essential supremum norm, and 
* formula_10 is the divergence operator. 
This definition &quot;does not require&quot; that the domain formula_11 of the given function be a bounded set.

===Total variation in measure theory===

====Classical total variation definition====
Following , consider a signed measure formula_12 on a measurable space formula_13: then it is possible to define two set functions formula_14 and formula_15, respectively called upper variation and lower variation, as follows

:formula_16
:formula_17

clearly

:formula_18

 The variation (also called absolute variation) of the signed measure formula_12 is the set function

:formula_20

and its total variation is defined as the value of this measure on the whole space of definition, i.e.

:formula_21

====Modern definition of total variation norm====
 uses upper and lower variations to prove the Hahn‚ÄìJordan decomposition: according to his version of this theorem, the upper and lower variation are respectively a non-negative and a non-positive measure. Using a more modern notation, define

:formula_22
:formula_23

Then formula_24 and formula_25 are two non-negative measures such that

:formula_26
:formula_27

The last measure is sometimes called, by abuse of notation, total variation measure.

====Total variation norm of complex measures====
If the measure formula_12 is complex-valued i.e. is a complex measure, its upper and lower variation cannot be defined and the Hahn‚ÄìJordan decomposition theorem can only be applied to its real and imaginary parts. However, it is possible to follow and define the total variation of the complex-valued measure formula_12 as follows

 The variation of the complex-valued measure formula_12 is the set function

:formula_31

where the supremum is taken over all partitions formula_32 of a measurable set formula_33 into a countable number of disjoint measurable subsets.

This definition coincides with the above definition formula_27 for the case of real-valued signed measures.

====Total variation norm of vector-valued measures====

The variation so defined is a positive measure (see ) and coincides with the one defined by when formula_12 is a signed measure: its total variation is defined as above. This definition works also if formula_12 is a vector measure: the variation is then defined by the following formula

:formula_37

where the supremum is as above. This definition is slightly more general than the one given by since it requires only to consider &quot;finite partitions&quot; of the space formula_38: this implies that it can be used also to define the total variation on finite-additive measures.

====Total variation of probability measures====
The total variation of any probability measure is exactly one, therefore it is not interesting as a means of investigating the properties of such measures. However, when Œº and ŒΩ are probability measures, the total variation distance of probability measures can be defined as formula_39 where the norm is the total variation norm of signed measures. Using the property that formula_40, we eventually arrive at the equivalent definition

:formula_41

and its values are non-trivial. The factor formula_42 above is usually dropped (as is the convention in the article total variation distance of probability measures). Informally, this is the largest possible difference between the probabilities that the two probability distributions can assign to the same event. For a categorical distribution it is possible to write the total variation distance as follows

:formula_43

It may also be normalized to values in formula_44 by halving the previous definition as follows

:formula_45

==Basic properties==

===Total variation of differentiable functions===
The total variation of a formula_46 function formula_1 can be expressed as an integral involving the given function instead of as the supremum of the functionals of definitions and .

====The form of the total variation of a differentiable function of one variable====
 The total variation of a differentiable function formula_1, defined on an interval formula_2, has the following expression if formula_50 is Riemann integrable

:formula_51

If formula_52 is differentiable and monotonic, then the above simplifies to
:formula_53

For any differentiable function formula_1, we can decompose the domain interval formula_55, into subintervals formula_56 (with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;a_1&lt;a_2&lt;\cdots&lt;a_N) in which formula_1 is locally monotonic, then the total variation of formula_52 over formula_55 can be written as the sum of local variations on those subintervals:
:formula_60

====The form of the total variation of a differentiable function of several variables====
 Given a formula_46 function formula_1 defined on a bounded open set formula_11, with formula_64 of class formula_65, the total variation of formula_1 has the following expression

:formula_67 .

=====Proof=====
The first step in the proof is to first prove an equality which follows from the Gauss‚ÄìOstrogradsky theorem.

=====Lemma=====
Under the conditions of the theorem, the following equality holds:
: formula_68

======Proof of the lemma======
From the Gauss‚ÄìOstrogradsky theorem:
: formula_69
by substituting formula_70, we have:

:formula_71
where formula_72 is zero on the border of formula_8 by definition:
:formula_74
:formula_75
:formula_76
:formula_77
:formula_78

=====Proof of the equality=====
Under the conditions of the theorem, from the lemma we have:
:formula_79
in the last part formula_80 could be omitted, because by definition its essential supremum is at most one.

On the other hand, we consider formula_81 and formula_82 which is the up to formula_83 approximation of formula_84 in formula_85 with the same integral. We can do this since formula_85 is dense in formula_87. Now again substituting into the lemma:

:formula_88
This means we have a convergent sequence of formula_89 that tends to formula_90 as well as we know that formula_91. Q.E.D.

It can be seen from the proof that the supremum is attained when
: formula_92

The function formula_1 is said to be of bounded variation precisely if its total variation is finite.

===Total variation of a measure===
The total variation is a norm defined on the space of measures of bounded variation. The space of measures on a œÉ-algebra of sets is a Banach space, called the ca space, relative to this norm. It is contained in the larger Banach space, called the ba space, consisting of &quot;finitely additive&quot; (as opposed to countably additive) measures, also with the same norm. The distance function associated to the norm gives rise to the total variation distance between two measures &quot;Œº&quot; and &quot;ŒΩ&quot;.

For finite measures on R, the link between the total variation of a measure &quot;Œº&quot; and the total variation of a function, as described above, goes as follows. Given &quot;Œº&quot;, define a function formula_94 by
:formula_95
Then, the total variation of the signed measure &quot;Œº&quot; is equal to the total variation, in the above sense, of the function formula_96. In general, the total variation of a signed measure can be defined using Jordan&#x27;s decomposition theorem by
:formula_97
for any signed measure &quot;Œº&quot; on a measurable space formula_13.

== Applications ==
Total variation can be seen as a non-negative real-valued functional defined on the space of real-valued functions (for the case of functions of one variable) or on the space of integrable functions (for the case of functions of several variables). As a functional, total variation finds applications in several branches of mathematics and engineering, like optimal control, numerical analysis, and calculus of variations, where the solution to a certain problem has to minimize its value. As an example, use of the total variation functional is common in the following two kind of problems

* Numerical analysis of differential equations: it is the science of finding approximate solutions to differential equations. Applications of total variation to these problems are detailed in the article &quot;&quot;total variation diminishing&quot;
* Image denoising: in image processing, denoising is a collection of methods used to reduce the noise in an image reconstructed from data obtained by electronic means, for example data transmission or sensing. &quot;Total variation denoising&quot;&quot; is the name for the application of total variation to image noise reduction; further details can be found in the papers of and . A sensible extension of this model to colour images, called Colour TV, can be found in .

<text>In probability theory, the total variation distance is a statistical distance between probability distributions, and is sometimes called the statistical distance, statistical difference or variational distance.

==Definition==
Consider a measurable space formula_1 and probability measures formula_2 and formula_3 defined on formula_1.
The total variation distance between formula_2 and formula_3 is defined as
:formula_7
This is the largest absolute difference between the probabilities that the two probability distributions assign to the same event.

==Properties==

The total variation distance is an &quot;f&quot;-divergence and an integral probability metric.

=== Relation to other distances ===
The total variation distance is related to the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence by Pinsker‚Äôs inequality:
:formula_8

One also has the following inequality, due to Bretagnolle and Huber (see also ), which has the advantage of providing a non-vacuous bound even when formula_9
:formula_10

The total variation distance is half of the L1 distance between the probability functions:
on discrete domains, this is the distance between the probability mass functions
:formula_11
and when the distributions have standard probability density functions and ,
:formula_12 
(or the analogous distance between Radon-Nikodym derivatives with any common dominating measure). This result can be shown by noticing that the supremum in the definition is achieved exactly at the set where one distribution dominates the other.

The total variation distance is related to the Hellinger distance formula_13 as follows:
: formula_14
These inequalities follow immediately from the inequalities between the 1-norm and the 2-norm.

=== Connection to transportation theory ===
The total variation distance (or half the norm) arises as the optimal transportation cost, when the cost function is formula_15, that is,
:formula_16
where the expectation is taken with respect to the probability measure formula_17 on the space where formula_18 lives, and the infimum is taken over all such formula_17 with marginals formula_2 and formula_3, respectively.

<text>John Simon Guggenheim (December 30, 1867 ‚Äì November 2, 1941) was an American businessman, politician and philanthropist.

==Early life and education==
Guggenheim was born in Philadelphia of Jewish descent on December 30, 1867, the son of Meyer Guggenheim and Barbara Guggenheim, and was the younger brother of Daniel Guggenheim and Solomon R. Guggenheim. He attended Central High School and the Peirce School of Business Administration, both in Philadelphia.

==Career==
After graduating from Peirce School of Business Administration, Guggenheim relocated to Pueblo, Colorado, where he worked as the chief ore buyer at M. Guggenheim&#x27;s Sons, his father&#x27;s mining and smelting company.

In 1898, he was the Republican candidate for Governor of Colorado, but withdrew after riots broke out at the state convention in Colorado Springs, during which one man was killed and several injured. He was a presidential elector in 1904.

===U.S. Senate===
In 1907, Simon Guggenheim was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate, representing Colorado from 1907 to 1913. During his term in the Senate, he chaired the Committee to Establish a University of the United States, and the Committee on the Philippines.

While he was in Congress, one of Guggenheim&#x27;s older brothers, Benjamin Guggenheim, died in the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; catastrophe.

===Business===
After his U.S. Senate term expired, he and his wife Olga returned to New York City. Guggenheim joined the board of American Smelting and Refining Company, and was later appointed chairman of the board. From 1919 to 1941, he was the company&#x27;s president.

==Personal life==
After moving to Denver in 1892, Guggenheim married Olga Hirsch on November 24, 1898, at the Waldorf Astoria New York in Manhattan. To celebrate their marriage, the Guggenheims provided a Thanksgiving dinner to 5,000 poor Manhattan children.

Their first child, John Simon Guggenheim, was born in 1905. To commemorate the event, Simon Guggenheim made an $80,000 donation () to the Colorado School of Mines to build a namesake building, Simon Guggenheim Hall. At the time, it was the largest private grant ever made to a state institution.

In 1907, Olga gave birth to their second son, George Denver Guggenheim. In 1909, Simon donated a law school building at the University of Colorado.

In 1922, Guggenheim&#x27;s son John died of mastoiditis just before leaving for college. In 1925, in his memory, Guggenheim and his wife established the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.

In 1939, the Guggenheims&#x27; second son, George, committed suicide in a Manhattan hotel at the age of 32.

==Death==
On November 2, 1941, Guggenheim died in New York City, at age 73. He is interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.

<text>Black Grape are an English rock band formed in Salford in 1993, featuring former members of Happy Mondays and Ruthless Rap Assassins. Their musical style fuses funk and electronic rock with electronic programming and samples.

==History==
===Formation, first two studio albums and break-up (1993‚Äì1998)===
The band was formed in 1993 by former Happy Mondays members Shaun Ryder and Bez. It was Ryder&#x27;s first musical project after the disintegration of Happy Mondays due both to his multiple drug addictions and to disagreements about revenues with other band members. The formation of the new band was intended to draw a line between his past life and his new one. Ryder and Bez recruited rappers Paul &quot;Kermit&quot; Leveridge and Carl &quot;Psycho&quot; McCarthy, drummer Ged Lynch (like Leveridge, a former member of Ruthless Rap Assassins), and guitarist Wags (formerly of the Manchester-based group the Paris Angels) and Oli &quot;Dirtycash&quot; Dillon on ocarina. Recording of new material started that year, although the group was not under contract.

In 1995, Black Grape were signed by Radioactive Records (an imprint of major label BMG) and released its debut studio album &quot;It&#x27;s Great When You&#x27;re Straight...Yeah&quot;. The album debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart, and spawned three top 20 singles. The album was certified platinum in the UK in April 1996.

The third single, &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; ‚Äì a song lampooning society&#x27;s obsession with celebrities and idols that had much to do with Ryder&#x27;s own previous hero worship of people he now saw as wastrels ‚Äì had its opening lyric changed before recording from &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me about heroes ‚Äì Most of these guys snort cocaine,&quot; to &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me about heroes ‚Äì most of these men sink like subs&quot;. Another song on the album, &quot;Temazi Party&quot;, mocked the then-current craze for abusing temazepam sleeping pills (a.k.a. &#x27;jellies&#x27;), but was deliberately misspelt on the album sleeve as &#x27;Tramazi&#x27; instead of &#x27;Temazi&#x27; to forestall any legal injunction against the album&#x27;s release.

The subsequent studio album &quot;Stupid Stupid Stupid&quot; was less commercially successful, but was certified gold in the UK in January 1998. The group broke-up in 1998 after Ryder fired the rest of the band while touring, starting with Kermit (who was suffering from septicaemia) and ending with Bez (who was unsatisfied with his financial situation).

Lynch went on to play drums and percussion on many other musical works, becoming a noted session musician.

===Reunion (2010‚Äìpresent)===
On 1 April 2010, Ryder briefly reformed Black Grape with producer Danny Saber for a concert as part of the &#x27;Get Loaded in the Dark&#x27; gig series at The Coronet in London.

In 2015, Black Grape reunited for a gig in April at the Old Granada Studios in Manchester. The gig was a benefit for Bez&#x27;s political party, We Are the Reality Party, which coincided with his bid for Parliament in the upcoming general election. Although Ryder and Kermit took to the stage, Bez joined them on stage towards the end of the gig. Soon after, it was announced that Black Grape had signed to Creation Management run by Alan McGee and Simon Fletcher and announced a reunion tour to coincide with 20 years of the band&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;It&#x27;s Great When You&#x27;re Straight...Yeah&quot; (1995). Although an original member, Bez did not rejoin the band.

Black Grape recorded and released a song &quot;We Are England&quot; in support of the England national football team for the UEFA Euro 2016 football competition, in collaboration with DJ Paul Oakenfold and singer Goldie, under the name 4 Lions. It was released by the management label Fletcher McGee Ltd under license to BMG Rights Management.

On 4 May 2017, it was announced that the group&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Pop Voodoo&quot; would be released on 7 July. On the same day, &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot; was released. The album was eventually released on 4 August. &quot;Louder Than War&quot; listed the album as one of its top 100 albums of 2017, placing it high at #23.

In September 2021, Black Grape went on the road to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their debut studio album ‚Äì originally planned for 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic saw the original shows rescheduled

&quot;Orange Head&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth album, was scheduled for release in November 2023, preceded by the single &quot;Milk&quot;. Instead the single &quot;Dirt&quot; was released in November, and the album pushed back to January 2024.

&quot;Orange Head&quot; was released on 19 January 2024.

<doc id="683583" wikidata="Q142091" url="?curid=683583" title="Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation">
<text>A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS or TNS) is a device that produces mild electric current to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of applied currents used for nerve excitation, but the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely, to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to reduce pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes which are typically conductive gel pads. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency, and intensity. Generally, TENS is applied at high frequency (&gt;50¬†Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (&lt;10¬†Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction. More recently, many TENS units use a mixed frequency mode which alleviates tolerance to repeated use. Intensity of stimulation should be strong but comfortable with greater intensities, regardless of frequency, producing the greatest analgesia. While the use of TENS has proved effective in clinical studies, there is controversy over which conditions the device should be used to treat.

==Medical uses==
===Pain===
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is a commonly used treatment approach to alleviate acute and chronic pain by reducing the sensitization of dorsal horn neurons, elevating levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine, and inhibiting glial activation. Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing clinical trials looking at the efficacy of TENS for different sources of pain, however, have been inconclusive due to a lack of high-quality and unbiased evidence. Potential benefits of TENS treatment include its safety profile, relative affordability, ease of self-administration, and availability over-the-counter without a prescription. In principle, an adequate intensity of stimulation is necessary to achieve pain relief with TENS. An analysis of treatment fidelity‚Äîmeaning that the delivery of TENS in a trial was in accordance with current clinical advice, such as using &quot;a strong but comfortable sensation&quot; and suitable, frequent treatment durations‚Äîshowed that higher-fidelity trials tended to have a positive outcome.

==== Acute pain ====
For people with recent-onset pain &quot;i.e.&quot;, fewer than three months, such as pain associated with surgery, trauma, and medical procedures, TENS may be better than placebo in some cases. The evidence of benefit is very weak, though.

==== Musculoskeletal and neck/back pain ====
There is some evidence to support a benefit of using TENS in chronic musculoskeletal pain. Results from a task force on neck pain in 2008 found no clinically significant benefit of TENS for the treatment of neck pain when compared to placebo. A 2010 review did not find evidence to support the use of TENS for chronic low back pain.

Another study examining knee osteoarthritis patients found that TENS demonstrated efficacy and a better safety profile relative to weak opiates. Given the age, comorbidity frequency, tendency toward polypharmacy, and sensitivity to adverse reactions among individuals most frequently reporting osteoarthritis, TENS could be a non-pharmacological alternative to analgesics in the management of knee osteoarthritis pain.

==== Neuropathy and phantom limb pain ====
There is tentative evidence that TENS may be useful for painful diabetic neuropathy. As of 2015, the efficacy of TENS for phantom limb pain is unknown; no randomized controlled trials have been performed.

A few studies have shown objective evidence that TENS may modulate or suppress pain signals in the brain. One used evoked cortical potentials to show that electric stimulation of peripheral A-beta sensory fibers reliably suppressed A-delta fiber nociceptive (pain perception) processing. Two other studies used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): one showed that high-frequency TENS produced a decrease in pain-related cortical activations in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, while the other showed that low-frequency TENS decreased shoulder impingement pain and modulated pain-induced activation in the brain.

====Labor and menstrual pain====
Early studies found that TENS &quot;has been shown not to be effective in postoperative and labour pain.&quot; These studies also had questionable ability to truly blind the patients. However, more recent studies have shown that TENS was &quot;effective for relieving labour pain, and they are well considered by pregnant participants.&quot; One study also showed that there was a significant change in laboring individuals&#x27; time to request analgesia such as an epidural. The group with the TENS waited five additional hours relative to those without TENS. Both groups were satisfied with the pain relief that they had from their choices. No maternal, infant, or labor problems were noted. There is tentative evidence that TENS may be helpful for treating pain from dysmenorrhoea, however further research is required.

==== Cancer pain ====
Non-pharmacological treatment options for people experiencing pain caused by cancer are much needed, however, it is not clear from the weak studies that have been published if TENS is an effective approach.

=== Bladder function ===
Percutaneous and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the tibial nerve have been used in the treatment of overactive bladder and urinary retention. Sometimes it is also done in the sacrum.
Systematic review studies have shown limited evidence on the effectiveness, and more quality research is needed. A major trial found that in a care home context transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation did not improve urinary incontinence.

=== Dentistry ===
TENS has been extensively used in non-odontogenic orofacial pain relief. In addition, TENS and ultra low frequency-TENS (ULF-TENS) are commonly employed in diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). Further clinical studies are required to determine its efficacy.

=== Tremor ===
A wearable neuromodulation device that delivers electrical stimulation to nerves in the wrist is now available by prescription. Worn around the wrist, it acts as a non-invasive treatment for those living with essential tremor. The stimulator has electrodes that are placed circumferentially around a patient&#x27;s wrist. Positioning the electrodes on generally opposing sides of the target nerve can result in improved stimulation of the nerve. In clinical trials reductions in hand tremors were reported following noninvasive median and radial nerve stimulation.

Transcutaneous afferent patterned stimulation (TAPS) is a tremor-customized therapy, based on the patient&#x27;s measured tremor frequency, and is delivered transcutaneously to the median and radial nerves of a patient&#x27;s wrist. The patient specific TAPS stimulation is determined through a calibration process performed by the accelerometer and microprocessor on the device.

The Cala ONE delivers TAPS in a wrist-worn device that is calibrated to treat tremor symptoms. Cala ONE received &quot;&quot; FDA clearance in April 2018 for the transient relief of hand tremors in adults with essential tremor and is currently marketed as Cala Trio.

== Contraindications ==
People who have implanted electronic medical devices including pacemakers and cardiodefibrillators are not suggested to use TENS. In addition, caution should be taken before using TENS in those who are pregnant, have epilepsy, have an active malignancy, have deep vein thrombosis, have skin that is damaged, or are frail. The use of TENS is likely to be less effective on areas of numb skin or decreased sensation due to nerve damage. It may also cause skin irritation due to the inability to feel currents until they are too high. There is an unknown level of risk when placing electrodes over an infection (possible spreading due to muscle contractions), but cross contamination with the electrodes themselves is of greater concern.

There are several anatomical locations where TENS electrodes are contraindicated:
* Over the eyes due to the risk of increasing intraocular pressure
* Transcerebrally
* On the front of the neck due to the risk of an acute hypotension (through a vasovagal response) or even a laryngospasm
* Through the chest using anterior and posterior electrode positions, or other transthoracic applications understood as &quot;across a thoracic diameter&quot;; this does not preclude coplanar applications
* Internally, except for specific applications of dental, vaginal, and anal stimulation that employ specialized TENS units
* On broken skin areas or wounds, although it can be placed around wounds
* Over a tumor or malignancy, based on in vitro experiments where electricity promotes cell growth
* Directly over the spinal column

=== Cardiac pacemakers ===
TENS used across an artificial cardiac pacemaker or other indwelling stimulator, including across its leads, may cause interference and failure of the implanted device. Serious accidents have been recorded in cases when this principle was not observed. A 2009 review in this area suggests that electrotherapy, including TENS, is &quot;best avoided&quot; in patients with pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). They add that &quot;there is no consensus and it may be possible to safely deliver these modalities in a proper setting with device and patient monitoring&quot;, and recommend further research. The review found several reports of ICDs administering inappropriate treatment due to interference with TENS devices, but notes that the reports on pacemakers are mixed: some non-programmable pacemakers were inhibited by TENS, but others were unaffected or auto-reprogrammed.

=== Pregnancy ===
TENS should be used with caution on people with epilepsy or on pregnant women; do not use over area of the uterus, as the effects of electrical stimulation on the developing fetus are not known.

== Side effects ==
Overall, TENS has been found to be safe compared with pharmaceutical medications for treating pain. Potential side effects include skin itching near the electrodes and mild redness of the skin (erythema). Some people also report that they dislike the sensation associated with TENS.

== Device types ==
The TENS device acts to stimulate the sensory nerves and a small portion of the peripheral motor nerves; the stimulation causes multiple mechanisms to trigger and manage the sense of pain in a patient. TENS operates by two main mechanisms: it stimulates competing sensory neurons at the pain perception gate, and it stimulates the opiate response. The mechanism that will be used varies with the type of device.

The table below lists the types of devices:
==History==
Electrical stimulation for pain control was used in ancient Rome, in AD 63. It was reported by Scribonius Largus that pain was relieved by standing on an electrical fish at the seashore. In the 16th through the 18th centuries various electrostatic devices were used for headache and other pains. Benjamin Franklin was a proponent of this method for pain relief. In the 19th century a device called the electreat, along with numerous other devices were used for pain control and cancer cures. Only the electreat survived into the 20th century, but was not portable, and had limited control of the stimulus. Development of the modern TENS unit is generally credited to C. Norman Shealy.

===Modern===
The first modern, patient-wearable TENS was patented in the United States in 1974. It was initially used for testing the tolerance of chronic pain patients to electrical stimulation before implantation of electrodes in the spinal cord dorsal column. The electrodes were attached to an implanted receiver, which received its power from an antenna worn on the surface of the skin. Although intended only for testing tolerance to electrical stimulation, many of the patients said they received so much relief from the TENS itself that they never returned for the implant.

A number of companies began manufacturing TENS units after the commercial success of the Medtronic device became known. The neurological division of Medtronic, founded by Don Maurer, Ed Schuck and Charles Ray, developed a number of applications for implanted electrical stimulation devices for treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and other disorders of the nervous system.

Today many people confuse TENS with electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). EMS and TENS devices look similar, with both using long electric lead wires and electrodes. TENS is for blocking pain, where EMS is for stimulating muscles.

Beginning in the late 1970s, in the USSR as part of their space program further research was conducted into electronic pain reduction devices. Dr. Alexander Karasev developed scenar (or skenar) devices, and later in the early 2000s cosmodic devices. Each of these device types uses the fundamental technique of reading electrical signals in the skin, analyzing the signals, and returning therapeutic electrical pulses into the nerves. He terms the TENS devices first generation electronic pain relief devices, scenar devices second generation devices, cosmodic devices as third generation devices, and the D.O.V.E. (Device Organizing Vital Energy) device as an advanced second generation device which automatically incorporates some cosmodic therapeutic features.

== Research ==
As reported, TENS has different effects on the brain. A randomized controlled trial in 2017 shown that sensory ULF-TENS applied on the skin proximally to trigeminal nerve, reduced the effect of acute mental stress assessed by heart rate variability (HRV). Further high quality studies are required to determine the effectiveness of TENS for treating dementia.

A head-mounted TENS device called Cefaly was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in March 2014, for the prevention of migraine attacks. The Cefaly device was found effective in preventing migraine attacks in a randomized sham-controlled trial. This was the first TENS device the FDA approved for pain prevention, as opposed to pain suppression.

A study performed on healthy human subjects demonstrates that repeated application of TENS can generate analgesic tolerance within five days, reducing its efficacy. The study noted that TENS causes the release of endogenous opioids, and that the analgesia is likely due to opioid tolerance mechanisms.

The pain reduction ability of TENS is unconfirmed by sufficient randomized controlled trials so far. One meta-analysis of several hundred TENS studies concluded that there was a significant overall reduction of pain intensity due to TENS, but there were too few participants and controls to be entirely certain of their validity. Therefore, the authors downgraded their confidence in the results by two levels, to low-certainty.

<doc id="683585" wikidata="Q160441" url="?curid=683585" title="Rabanus Maurus">
<text>Rabanus Maurus Magnentius ( 780 ‚Äì 4 February 856), also known as Hrabanus or Rhabanus, was a Frankish Benedictine monk, theologian, poet, encyclopedist and military writer who became archbishop of Mainz in East Francia. He was the author of the encyclopaedia &quot;De rerum naturis&quot; (&quot;On the Natures of Things&quot;). He also wrote treatises on education and grammar and commentaries on the Bible. He was one of the most prominent teachers and writers of the Carolingian age, and was called &quot;Praeceptor Germaniae&quot;, or &quot;the teacher of Germany&quot;. In the most recent edition of the Roman Martyrology (&quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot;, 2004, pp.¬†133), his feast is given as 4 February and he is qualified as a Saint (&#x27;sanctus&#x27;).

==Life==

Rabanus was born of noble parents in Mainz. The date of his birth remains uncertain, but in 801 he was ordained a deacon at Benedictine Abbey of Fulda in Hesse, where he had been sent to school and had become a monk. At the insistence of Ratgar, his abbot, he went together with Haimo (later of Halberstadt) to complete his studies at Tours. There he studied under Alcuin, who in recognition of his diligence and purity gave him the surname of Maurus, after the favourite disciple of Benedict, Saint Maurus.

Returning to Fulda, in 803 he was entrusted with the principal charge of the abbey school, which under his direction became one of the most preeminent centers of scholarship and book production in Europe, and sent forth such pupils as Walafrid Strabo, Servatus Lupus of Ferri√®res, and Otfrid of Weissenburg. It was probably at this period that he compiled his excerpt from the grammar of Priscian, a popular textbook during the Middle Ages. According to Alban Butler&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Saints,&quot; Rabanus ate no meat and drank no wine.

In 814 Rabanus was ordained a priest. Shortly afterwards, apparently on account of disagreement with Abbot Ratgar, he withdrew for a time from Fulda. This banishment was long thought to have occasioned a pilgrimage to Palestine, based on an allusion in his commentary on Joshua. However, the passage in question is taken from Origen&#x27;s &quot;Homily&quot; xiv &quot;In Librum Jesu Nave&quot;. Hence, it was Origen, not Rabanus, who visited Palestine. Rabanus returned to Fulda in 817 on the election of a new abbot, Eigil, and at Eigil&#x27;s death in 822, Rabanus himself became abbot. He handled this position efficiently and successfully, but in 842 he resigned so as to have greater leisure for study and prayer, retiring to the neighbouring monastery of St Petersberg.

In 847 Rabanus was constrained to return to public life when he was elected to succeed Otgar as Archbishop of Mainz. He died at Winkel on the Rhine in 856.

==Hymns==
Rabanus composed a number of hymns, the most famous of which is the &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot;. This is a hymn to the Holy Spirit often sung at Pentecost and at ordinations. It is known in English through many translations, including &quot;Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire&quot;; &quot;Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest&quot;; and &quot;Creator Spirit, by whose aid.&quot; &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot; was used by Gustav Mahler as the first chorale of his eighth symphony.

Another of Rabanus&#x27; hymns, &quot;Christ, the fair glory of the holy angels&quot; (&quot;Christe, sanctorum decus Angelorum&quot;), sung for the commemoration of Saint Michael and All Angels, and to include the archangels Gabriel and Raphael, is found in English translation in &quot;The Hymnal 1982&quot; (of the Episcopal Church), and was harmonized by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

==Works==

Rabanus&#x27; works, many of which remained unpublished, comprise commentaries on scripture (Genesis to Judges, Ruth, Kings, Chronicles, Judith, Esther, Canticles, Proverbs, Wisdom, Sirach, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Maccabees, Matthew, the Epistles of St Paul, including Hebrews); and various treatises relating to doctrinal and practical subjects, including more than one series of homilies. In &quot;De institutione clericorum&quot; he brought into prominence the views of Augustine and Gregory the Great as to the training which was requisite for a right discharge of the clerical function. One of his most popular and enduring works is a collection of poems centered on the cross, called &quot;De laudibus sanctae crucis&quot; or &quot;In honorem sanctae crucis,&quot; a set of highly sophisticated poems that present the cross (and, in the last poem, Rabanus himself kneeling before it) in word and image, even in numbers.

Among the others may be mentioned the &quot;De universo libri xxii., sive etymologiarum opus&quot;, a kind of dictionary or encyclopedia, heavily dependent upon Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologies&quot;, designed as a help towards the typological, historical and mystical interpretation of Scripture, the &quot;De sacris ordinibus&quot;, the &quot;De disciplina ecclesiastica&quot; and the &quot;Martyrologium&quot;. All of them are characterized by erudition (he knew even some Greek and Hebrew). He also published an annotated version of &quot;De re militari&quot; to improve Frankish warfare.

In the annals of German philology a special interest attaches to the &quot;Glossaria Latino-Theodisca&quot;. A commentary, &quot;Super Porphyrium&quot;, printed by Cousin in 1836 among the &quot;Ouvrages in√©dits d&#x27;Ab√©lard&quot;, and assigned both by that editor and by Haurau to Hrabantis Maurus, is now generally believed to have been the work of a disciple.

In 2006 Germans marked the 1150th anniversary of his death, especially in Mainz and in Fulda. Highlights of the celebrations included the display of Codex Vaticanus Reginensis latinus 124, an extremely rare loan by the Vatican to Mainz of a spectacular manuscript containing &quot;De laudibus sanctae crucis&quot;. The anniversary also saw the publication of no fewer than three book-length studies of Maurus and his work.

===Marcomannic runes===

A runic alphabet recorded in a treatise called &quot;De Inventione Litterarum&quot; has been ascribed to Rabanus. It consisted of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo-Saxon runes and is preserved in 8th and 9th-century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the Carolingian Empire (Alemannia, Bavaria). The manuscript text attributes the runes to the &quot;Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus&quot; (and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called &quot;Marcomannic runes&quot;) but it has no connection with the Marcomanni, and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabet with runic equivalents.

Wilhelm Grimm discussed these runes in 1821.

==Bibliography==
The first nominally complete edition of the works of Hrabanus Maurus was that of Georges Colvener (Cologne, 6 vols. fol., 1627). The &quot;Opera omnia&quot; form vols. cvii‚Äìcxii of Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologiae cursus completus&quot; (1852). The &quot;De universo&quot; is the subject of &quot;Compendium der Naturwissenschaften an der Schule zu Fulda im IX. Jahrhundert&quot; (Berlin, 1880).

Recent critical editions and translations are available of some of his works:

<text>A liquidity trap is a situation, described in Keynesian economics, in which, &quot;after the rate of interest has fallen to a certain level, liquidity preference may become virtually absolute in the sense that almost everyone prefers holding cash rather than holding a debt (financial instrument) which yields so low a rate of interest.&quot;

A liquidity trap is caused when people hold cash because they expect an adverse event such as deflation, insufficient aggregate demand, or war. Among the characteristics of a liquidity trap are interest rates that are close to zero and changes in the money supply that fail to translate into changes in the price level.

==Origin and definition of the term==
John Maynard Keynes, in his 1936 &quot;General Theory&quot;, wrote the following: There is the possibility...that, after the rate of interest has fallen to a certain level, liquidity-preference may become virtually absolute in the sense that almost everyone prefers cash to holding a debt which yields so low a rate of interest. In this event the monetary authority would have lost effective control over the rate of interest. But whilst this limiting case might become practically important in future, I know of no example of it hitherto.

This concept of monetary policy&#x27;s potential impotence was further worked out in the works of British economist John Hicks, who published the IS‚ÄìLM model representing Keynes&#x27;s system. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, in his work on monetary policy, follows the formulations of Hicks: A liquidity trap may be defined as a situation in which conventional monetary policies have become impotent, because nominal interest rates are at or near zero: injecting monetary base into the economy has no effect, because [monetary] base and bonds are viewed by the private sector as perfect substitutes. In a liquidity trap, people are indifferent between bonds and cash because the rates of interest both financial instruments provide to their holder is practically equal: The interest on cash is zero and the interest on bonds is near-zero. Hence, the central bank cannot affect the interest rate any more (through augmenting the monetary base) and has lost control over it.

==Elaboration==
In Keynes&#x27; description of a liquidity trap, people simply do not want to hold bonds and prefer other, more-liquid forms of money instead. Because of this preference, after converting bonds into cash, this causes an incidental but significant decrease to the bonds&#x27; prices and a subsequent increase to their yields. However, people prefer cash no matter how high these yields are or how high the central bank sets the bond&#x27;s rates (yields).

Post-Keynesian economist Hyman Minsky posited that &quot;after a debt deflation that induces a deep depression, an increase in the money supply with a fixed head count of other [financial] assets may not lead to a rise in the price of other assets.&quot; This naturally causes interest rates on assets that are not considered &quot;almost perfectly liquid&quot; to rise. In which case, as Minsky had stated elsewhere,The view that the liquidity-preference function is a demand-for-money relation permits the introduction of the idea that in appropriate circumstances the demand for money may be infinitely elastic with respect to variations in the interest rate‚Ä¶ The liquidity trap presumably dominates in the immediate aftermath of a recession or financial crisis.

==Historical debate==
In the wake of the Keynesian Revolution in the 1930s and 1940s, various neoclassical economists sought to minimize the effect of liquidity-trap conditions. Don Patinkin and Lloyd Metzler invoked the existence of the so-called &quot;Pigou effect&quot;, in which the stock of real money balances is ostensibly an argument of the aggregate demand function for goods, so that the money stock would directly affect the &quot;investment saving&quot; curve in IS/LM analysis. Monetary policy would thus be able to stimulate the economy even when there is a liquidity trap.

Monetarists, most notably Milton Friedman, Anna Schwartz, Karl Brunner, Allan Meltzer and others, strongly condemned any notion of a &quot;trap&quot; that did not feature an environment of a zero, or near-zero, interest rate across the whole spectrum of interest rates, i.e. both short- and long-term debt of the government and the private sector. In their view, any interest rate different from zero along the yield curve is a sufficient condition to eliminate the possibility of the presence of a liquidity trap.

In recent times, when the Japanese economy fell into a period of prolonged stagnation, despite near-zero interest rates, the concept of a liquidity trap returned to prominence. Keynes&#x27;s formulation of a liquidity trap refers to the existence of a horizontal demand-curve for money at some positive level of interest rates; yet, the liquidity trap invoked in the 1990s referred merely to the presence of zero or near-zero interest-rates policies (ZIRP), the assertion being that interest rates could not fall below zero. Some economists, such as Nicholas Crafts, have suggested a policy of inflation-targeting (by a central bank that is independent of the government) at times of prolonged, very low, nominal interest-rates, in order to avoid a liquidity trap or escape from it.

Some Austrian School economists, such as those of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, reject Keynes&#x27; theory of liquidity preference altogether. They argue that lack of domestic investment during periods of low interest-rates is the result of previous malinvestment and time preferences rather than liquidity preference. Chicago school economists remain critical of the notion of liquidity traps.

Keynesian economists, like Brad DeLong and Simon Wren-Lewis, maintain that the economy continues to operate within the IS-LM model, albeit an &quot;updated&quot; one, and the rules have &quot;simply changed.&quot;

==2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 recession==

During the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis, as short-term interest rates for the various central banks in the United States and Europe moved close to zero, economists such as Paul Krugman argued that much of the developed world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, was in a liquidity trap. He noted that tripling of the monetary base in the US between 2008 and 2011 failed to produce any significant effect on domestic price indices or dollar-denominated commodity prices, a notion supported by others, such as Scott Sumner.

U.S. Federal Reserve economists assert that the liquidity trap can explain low inflation in periods of vastly increased central bank money supply. Based on experience $3.5 trillion of quantitative easing from 2009‚Äì2013, the hypothesis is that investors hoard and do not spend the increased money because the opportunity cost of holding cash (namely the interest forgone) is zero when the nominal interest rate is zero. This hoarding effect is purported to have reduced consequential inflation to half of what would be expected directly from the increase in the money supply, based on statistics from the expansive years. They further assert that the liquidity trap is possible only when the economy is in deep recession.

Modest inflation during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, despite unprecedented monetary stimulus and expansion, was similarly ascribed to hoarding of cash.

Post-Keynesians respond that the confusion by &quot;mainstream economists&quot; between conditions of a liquidity trap, as defined by Keynes and in the Post-Keynesian framework, and conditions of near-zero or zero interest rates, is intentional and ideologically motivated in ostensibly attempting to support monetary over fiscal policies. They argue that, quantitative easing programs in the United States, and elsewhere, caused the prices of financial assets to rise across the board and interest rates to fall; yet, a liquidity trap cannot exist, according to the Keynesian definition, unless the prices on imperfectly safe financial assets are falling and their interest rates are rising. The rise in the monetary base did not affect interest rates or commodity prices.

Taking the precedent of the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis, critics of the mainstream definition of a liquidity trap point out that the central bank of the United States never, effectively, lost control of the interest rate. Whereas the United States did experience a liquidity trap in the period 2009/10, i.e. in &quot;the immediate aftermath&quot; of the crisis, the critics of the mainstream definition claim that, after that period, there is no more of any kind of a liquidity trap since government and private-sector bonds are &quot;very much in demand&quot;. This goes against Keynes&#x27; point as Keynes stated that &quot;almost everyone prefers cash to holding a debt.&quot; However, modern finance has the concept of cash and cash equivalents; Treasuries may in some cases be treated as cash equivalents and not &quot;debt&quot; for liquidity purposes.

<text>A microcurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulator or MENS (also microamperage electrical neuromuscular stimulator) is a device used to send weak electrical signals into the body. Such devices apply extremely small microamp [uA] electrical currents (less than 1 milliampere [mA]) to the tissues using electrodes placed on the skin. One microampere [uA] is 1 millionth of an ampere and the uses of MENS are distinct from those of &quot;TENS&quot; which runs at one milliamp [mA] or one thousandth of an amp.

== Uses ==
MENS uses include treatments for pain, diabetic neuropathy, age-related macular degeneration, wound healing, tendon repair, plantar fasciitis and ruptured ligament recovery. Most microcurrent treatments concentrate on pain and/or speeding healing and recovery. It is commonly used by professional and performance athletes with acute pain and/or muscle tenderness as it is drug-free and non-invasive, thus avoiding testing and recovery issues. It is also used as a cosmetic treatment.

== History ==
The body&#x27;s electrical capabilities were studied at least as early as 1830, when the Italian Carlo Matteucci is credited as being one of the first to measure the electrical current in injured tissue. Bioelectricity received less attention after the discovery of penicillin, when the focus of medical research and treatments turned toward the body&#x27;s chemical processes. Attention began to return to these properties and the possibilities of using very low current for healing in the mid-1900s. In a study published in 1969, for example, a team of researchers led by L.E. Wolcott applied microcurrent to a wide variety of wounds, using negative polarity over lesions in the initial phase, and then alternating application of positive and negative electrodes every three days. The stimulation current ranged from 200 to 800 uA and the treated group showed 200%-350% faster healing rates, with stronger tensile strength of scar tissue and antibacterial effects. 

In 1991, the German scientists Drs. Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their development of the patch-clamp technique that allows the detection of minute electrical currents through cell membranes. This method allowed the detection of more than 20 different types of ion channel which permit positive or negatively charged ions to cross the cell membrane, confirming that cellular electrical activity is not limited only to nerve and muscle tissues.

== Efficacy ==
A study by a neuroretinologist in the late 1980s suggested that microcurrent stimulation of acupuncture points for the eye had positive effects in slowing and even stopping progression of macular degeneration. This treatment is used to treat both the Wet and Dry forms of AMD. This study was based on Ngok Cheng&#x27;s research on the increased amounts of ATP levels in living tissue after being stimulated with microcurrent.

== Mechanisms of action ==
While the mechanisms of efficacy are not well established, a few studies have shown that there may be a correlation between the traditional Chinese medical system of acupuncture and microcurrent. A study published in 1975 by Reichmanis, Marino, and Becker concluded in part that. &quot;At most acupuncture points on most subjects, there were greater electrical conductance maxims than at control sites.&quot;

== Manufacturers ==
Many companies manufacture microcurrent devices for both professional and personal use, and microcurrent stimulation is used as a &quot;complementary&quot; veterinary modality.

<text>In population genetics, &quot;F&quot;-statistics (also known as fixation indices) describe the statistically expected level of heterozygosity in a population; more specifically the expected degree of (usually) a reduction in heterozygosity when compared to Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg expectation.

&quot;F&quot;-statistics can also be thought of as a measure of the correlation between genes drawn at different levels of a (hierarchically) subdivided population. This correlation is influenced by several evolutionary processes, such as genetic drift, founder effect, bottleneck, genetic hitchhiking, meiotic drive, mutation, gene flow, inbreeding, natural selection, or the Wahlund effect, but it was originally designed to measure the amount of allelic fixation owing to genetic drift.

The concept of &quot;F&quot;-statistics was developed during the 1920s by the American geneticist Sewall Wright, who was interested in inbreeding in cattle. However, because complete dominance causes the phenotypes of homozygote dominants and heterozygotes to be the same, it was not until the advent of molecular genetics from the 1960s onwards that heterozygosity in populations could be measured.

&quot;F&quot; can be used to define effective population size.

== Definitions and equations ==
The measures FIS, FST, and FIT are related to the amounts of heterozygosity at various levels of population structure. Together, they are called &quot;F&quot;-statistics, and are derived from &quot;F&quot;, the inbreeding coefficient. In a simple two-allele system with inbreeding, the genotypic frequencies are:

:formula_1

The value for formula_2 is found by solving the equation for formula_2 using heterozygotes in the above inbred population. This becomes one minus the observed frequency of heterozygotes in a population divided by the expected frequency of heterozygotes at Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium:

:formula_4

where the expected frequency at Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium is given by

:formula_5

where formula_6 and formula_7 are the allele frequencies of formula_8 and formula_9, respectively. It is also the probability that at any locus, two alleles from a random individual of the population are identical by descent.

For example, consider the data from E.B. Ford (1971) on a single population of the scarlet tiger moth:

From this, the allele frequencies can be calculated, and the expectation of formula_10 derived :

: formula_11

: formula_12

: formula_13

The different F-statistics look at different levels of population structure. FIT is the inbreeding coefficient of an individual (I) relative to the total (T) population, as above; FIS is the inbreeding coefficient of an individual (I) relative to the subpopulation (S), using the above for subpopulations and averaging them; and FST is the effect of subpopulations (S) compared to the total population (T), and is calculated by solving the equation:

:formula_14

as shown in the next section.

== Partition due to population structure ==

Consider a population that has a population structure of two levels; one from the individual (I) to the subpopulation (S) and one from the subpopulation to the total (T). Then the total formula_2, known here as formula_16, can be partitioned into formula_17 and formula_18:

:formula_19

This may be further partitioned for population substructure, and it expands according to the rules of binomial expansion, so that for &quot;I&quot; partitions:

:formula_20
== Fixation index ==
A reformulation of the definition of formula_2 would be the ratio of the average number of differences between pairs of chromosomes sampled within diploid individuals with the average number obtained when sampling chromosomes randomly from the population (excluding the grouping per individual).
One can modify this definition and consider a grouping per sub-population instead of per individual. Population geneticists have used that idea to measure the degree of structure in a population.

Unfortunately, there is a large number of definitions for formula_18, causing some confusion in the scientific literature. A common definition is the following:

: formula_23

where the variance of formula_24 is computed across sub-populations and formula_25 is the expected frequency of heterozygotes.

=== Fixation index in human populations ===

It is well established that the genetic diversity among human populations is low, although the distribution of the genetic diversity was only roughly estimated. Early studies argued that 85‚Äì90% of the genetic variation is found within individuals residing in the same populations within continents (intra-continental populations) and only an additional 10‚Äì15% is found between populations of different continents (continental populations). Later studies based on hundreds of thousands single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) suggested that the genetic diversity between continental populations is even smaller and accounts for 3 to 7% A later study based on three million SNPs found that 12% of the genetic variation is found between continental populations and only 1% within them. Most of these studies have used the &quot;F&quot;&quot;ST&quot; statistics or closely related statistics.

<doc id="683592" wikidata="Q1216507" url="?curid=683592" title="The Beachcombers">
<text>The Beachcombers is a Canadian comedy drama television series that ran on CBC Television from October 1, 1972, to December 12, 1990. With over 350 episodes, it is one of the longest-running dramatic series ever made for Canadian English-language television.

==Series overview==

&quot;The Beachcombers&quot; followed the life of Nick Adonidas (Bruno Gerussi), a Greek Canadian log salvager in British Columbia who earned a living traveling the coastline northwest of Vancouver with his partner Jesse Jim (Pat John) aboard their logging tug &quot;Persephone&quot; tracking down logs that broke away from barges and logging booms. Their chief business competitor is Relic (Robert Clothier) (whose actual name is Stafford T. Phillips), a somewhat unsavoury person who will occasionally go to great lengths to steal business (and logs) from Nick.

The series also focused on a supporting cast of characters in Nick&#x27;s hometown of Gibsons, often centering on a caf√©, Molly&#x27;s Reach, run by Molly (Rae Brown), a mother figure to virtually all the characters in the series (including Relic). In addition, Molly rented out a room to Nick as living quarters and office space for his salvage business. Molly had two grandchildren living with her, Hughie (Bob Park) and his younger sister Margaret played by Nancy Chapple in the first season then by Juliet Randall from the second season onward. RCMP Constable John Constable (played by Alberta-born Jackson Davies) was the lawman.
The series&#x27; pilot episode was called &quot;Jesse&#x27;s Car&quot; and was turned down by CBC for broadcast. The first episode to air was called &quot;Partners&quot; and described how Jesse and Nick formed their business ties.

During the run of the series, storylines became more complex as the characters developed. Many episodes focused on Nick&#x27;s Greek heritage.

The series&#x27; musical score was composed and orchestrated by Canadian composer and producer Bobby Hales and later by Vancouver based composer, Claire Lawrence. Numerous Vancouver-area musical artists appeared on the soundtracks of the series, including Cos Natola.

==Changes to original series==
The series&#x27; removed &quot;The&quot; from its title, becoming simply &quot;Beachcombers&quot; in 1988 (with the CBC announcing that the intent was to give the aging show a new look), coinciding with the replacement of the show&#x27;s original theme music with a new composition. Subsequent funding cutbacks at the government-supported CBC, however, led to &quot;Beachcombers&quot; being cancelled even though it was still popular in its homeland and syndicated around the world, though attempts to revamp the series by giving it more suspenseful storylines and making it more action oriented met with fan criticism.
The final episode had Nick Adonidas accused of stealing logs during a time when rising expenses were causing many beachcombers to seek another occupation. The story ended with Nick saying to Relic, ‚ÄúWe gave ‚Äòem a run for their money, didn‚Äôt we?‚Äù

==Multicultural== 
The show was an active window into Canada&#x27;s multicultural heritage. Gerussi&#x27;s character, Nick Adonidas was a Greek and one storyline in a later season chronicled Nick&#x27;s return to his homeland, while Clothier&#x27;s character, Relic, was of Welsh ancestry.

Pat John, who played Jesse Jim, was a member of the sh√≠sh√°lh Nation. Other Indigenous cast members were Charlene Aleck as Jesse‚Äôs sister Sara, Marianne Jones as Jesse‚Äôs wife Laurel, and Chief Dan George as Chief Moses Charlie.

==Spin-off series, TV movies, reboot series==
A short lived spin-off television show called &quot;Constable Constable&quot; ran in 1985. The show was based on Jackson Davies&#x27;s &quot;Beachcombers&quot; character Constable John Constable. The series was filmed in Vancouver and starred Jackson Davies and Walter Learning.

Jackson Davies, Pat John and Charlene Aleck were the only original-series cast members who had speaking parts in the show&#x27;s follow up television movie &quot;The New Beachcombers&quot;, produced in 2002, a pilot for a revived series that ran for two years. Bob Park (Hugh) and Dion Luther (Pat) appeared in cameo roles. By this time, Gerussi, Clothier, and Brown all had died, so new characters were introduced played by (among others) Dave Thomas, Graham Greene, Cameron Bancroft, and Deanna Milligan. A sequel, &quot;A Beachcombers Christmas&quot;, was also produced.

A documentary about the show called &quot;Welcome Back to Molly&#x27;s Reach&quot; aired in 2002. On July 27‚Äì29, 2007, former cast and crew gathered in Gibsons, British Columbia, for the show&#x27;s 35th anniversary.

A best selling book, &quot;Bruno and The Beach: The Beachcombers at 40&quot; celebrating its 40th anniversary was released in December 2012. It was co-written by Marc Strange, co-creator of the series, and Jackson Davies, who starred in the series as Constable John Constable.

In October 2022, it was announced that &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; would be remade as an animated series that was slated to air in Spring 2023 but is currently delayed.

==Filming locations==
The series was filmed on location in Gibsons, British Columbia, and the surrounding area. The caf√© featured in the show was built as a hardware store in 1934 and served various retail functions until rented as a film set for the series, used mainly for exterior shots and storage. The building only became a caf√© after the series ended. After &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; was cancelled in 1990, the building sat vacant for a time with an uncertain future. Eventually, investors converted it into a functioning restaurant under the television-inspired name &quot;Molly&#x27;s Reach&quot;. As of August 2023, the restaurant is closed and the property is available for lease.

&quot;Persephone&quot;, the boat used by Nick Adonidas during filming, was a tug and work boat named &quot;John Henry&quot; built in 1965. The tug was chartered during series production from Harry Smith, who donated it to the town of Gibsons in 1991. The vessel sat outside at a town works department gravel pit where it deteriorated quite badly until it was restored by the Sunshine Coast Museum and Archives. &quot;Persephone&quot; was installed in a small park near Molly&#x27;s Reach in 2007.

There were two jet boats used by the character Relic. The one most fans remember was called &quot;Hi Baller II&quot; and was used from the second season until the end. The first craft, &quot;Hi Baller I&quot;, was used for just the first season. She was slightly smaller than her successor and had more square windows. She did reappear for an episode called &quot;Jet Boat Gemini&quot; in 1974. Both boats were seen together as the man in the second craft was impersonating Relic. He was stealing logs and hassling local residents until Relic saved the day at the end in a duel of jet boats.

==International broadcasts==
The series was syndicated around the world and was shown by ITV in the United Kingdom, SCTV in Indonesia and on PBS (as well as in syndication on commercial stations) in the United States. It has also been shown in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Africa, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Kuwait, Seychelles, Malaysia, Brunei and Egypt. The West German television station ZDF also broadcast the series, as &quot;Strandpiraten&quot; (&quot;Beach Pirates&quot;).

The show was seen in reruns on Vision TV and the pre-news channel version of Sun TV in Canada as well as the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) in Canada and ALN in the United States.

==Media references==
*The show was featured in the 2001 video for &quot;Same Thing Twice&quot; by The Flashing Lights.
*The show and its main characters were referenced by some of the characters on a 2007 episode of &quot;Corner Gas&quot; called &quot;Cable Excess&quot; in a failed attempt at comparing themselves to the show. The character, Brent Leroy, rhetorically asks &quot;You think maybe &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; was the best Canadian TV show of all time?&quot;
*The show was referenced in a 2019 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; called &quot;D&#x27;oh Canada&quot;.

<text>The Argentine Football Association (, ; AFA) is the governing body of football in Argentina based in Buenos Aires. It organises the main divisions of Argentine league system (from Primera Divisi√≥n to Torneo Regional Federal and Torneo Promocional Amateur), including domestic cups: Copa Argentina, Supercopa Argentina, Trofeo de Campeones de la Liga Profesional and the Supercopa Internacional. The body also manages all the Argentina national teams, including the Senior, U-20, U-17, U-15, Olympic and women&#x27;s squads. Secondly, it also organizes the women&#x27;s, children, youth, futsal, and other local leagues.

The AFA also organised all the Primera Divisi√≥n championships from 1893 to 2016‚Äì17. From the 2017‚Äì18 season the &quot;Superliga Argentina&quot;, an entity which was administered independently and had its own statute, took over the Primera Divisi√≥n championships. Nevertheless, the Superliga was contractually linked with the main football body. The last championship organised by the Superliga was 2019‚Äì20, shortly after the season ended the body was dissolved.

== History ==
The Argentine Association Football League (in English) was founded on 21 February 1893 by Alexander Watson Hutton, considered &quot;the father&quot; of Argentine football. The Argentine Association is the oldest in South America and one of the oldest to be formed outside Europe. In 1906, Florencio Mart√≠nez de Hoz became the first Argentine-born president of the association.

In 1912, the president of Gimnasia y Esgrima (BA), Ricardo Aldao, broke up with the association, establishing an own league, the &quot;Federaci√≥n Argentina de Football&quot; which organized a parallel tournament. Some teams moved to the FAF were Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP), Independiente, Estudiantes (LP) and Atlanta. The league lasted until 1914 when rejoining &quot;Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Football&quot;, forming a unique league for the 1915 season.

The second dissident league was formed in 1919 and named &quot;Asociaci√≥n Amateurs de Football&quot;, organizing its own championships (as FAF had done) until 1926 when it merged to the official association. The dissident league included some of the most prominent teams, such as River Plate, Racing, Independiente and San Lorenzo, with the exception of Boca Juniors that remained in the official &quot;Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Football&quot;.

When both leagues merged for the 1927 season, the association was again renamed to &quot;Asociaci√≥n Amateur Argentina de Football&quot; until the professionalization of the sport in 1931 when it switched to &quot;Liga Argentina de Football&quot;. The first round of the recently created professional championship was on 31 May 1931.

Despite football turning professional in Argentina, some clubs wanted to remain amateur, so they formed a new league, the &quot;Asociaci√≥n de Football Amateur y Profesionales&quot;, which organized a parallel tournament until 1934 when the dissident association merged with LAF on 3 November 1934 to form the &quot;Asociaci√≥n del Football Argentino&quot; which has remained since.

In 2015, during the presidential elections to elect a new president for the body, there were two candidates to occupy Julio Humberto Grondona&#x27;s chair, Marcelo Tinelli ‚Äìwho wanted a change in how things were going, like eliminating corruption between some clubs and the AFA‚Äì and Luis Segura, who had taken charge after Grondona&#x27;s death, with the intention of extending his mandate.

With 75 presidents of different Argentine clubs voting, on election day something went wrong when the final count resulted in a draw of 38 to 38 (76 votes in total). The explanation given was that one of the electors put a double vote and that mistake was not reported. As a result, the executive committee decided to postpone the election.

After some meetings to put an end to the conflict, both candidates agreed to have another election in June 2016.

In June 2016, AFA president Luis Segura was charged with &quot;aggravated administrative fraud&quot;. Segura has been replaced on an interim basis by the AFA&#x27;s executive secretary, Dami√°n Dupiellet.

In 2017, the association approved the creation of a new entity, named &quot;Superliga Argentina de F√∫tbol&quot;, which would take over the organization of the Primera Divisi√≥n championship. The main European football leagues such as the English Premier League or the Spanish La Liga, that are organized by associations dedicated exclusively to those championships and run as separate entities from their respective National Associations, served as inspiration for the creation of the Superliga.

The 2016‚Äì17 Primera Divisi√≥n championship was the last tournament organized by the AFA. Starting with the 2017‚Äì18 season to 2019‚Äì20 season, the &quot;Superliga Argentina&quot;, an entity administered by itself with its own statute, organised Primera Divisi√≥n championships. In March 2020, AFA dissolved the Superliga and took over the Primera Divisi√≥n again.

<text>The County Championship, currently known for sponsorship reasons as the Rothesay County Championship, is the only domestic first-class cricket competition in England and Wales. Established in 1890, it is organised by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) as a two-league system. The tournament is contested by eighteen clubs representing the historic counties of England and (in one case) Wales. The reigning champions are Surrey.

The earliest known inter-county match was played in 1709. Until 1889, the concept of an unofficial county championship existed whereby various claims would be made by or on behalf of a particular club as the &quot;Champion County&quot;, an archaic term which now has the specific meaning of a claimant for the unofficial title prior to 1890. In contrast, the term &quot;County Champions&quot; applies in common parlance to a team that has won the official title. The most usual means of claiming the unofficial title was by popular or press acclaim. In the majority of cases, the claim or proclamation was retrospective, often by cricket writers using reverse analysis via a study of known results. The unofficial title was not proclaimed in every season up to 1889 because in many cases there were not enough matches or there was simply no clear candidate. Having already been badly hit by the Seven Years&#x27; War, county cricket ceased altogether during the Napoleonic Wars and there was a period from 1797 to 1824 during which no inter-county matches took place. The concept of the unofficial title has been utilised &quot;ad hoc&quot; and relied on sufficient interest being shown.

The &quot;official&quot; County Championship was constituted on 16 December 1889, when secretaries of the major clubs gathered at Lord&#x27;s to decide the following season&#x27;s fixtures. Simultaneously, representatives of the eight leading counties met privately to determine how teams would be ranked. The new competition began in the 1890 season and at first involved just the eight leading clubs: Gloucestershire, Kent, Lancashire, Middlesex, Nottinghamshire, Surrey, Sussex and Yorkshire. Subsequently, the championship has been expanded to 18 clubs by the additions at various times of Derbyshire, Durham, Essex, Glamorgan, Hampshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Somerset, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. Counties without first-class status compete in the National Counties Cricket Championship.

==History==
===Origin of concept===
It is difficult to know when the concept of a county championship originated. While early matches were often between teams named after counties, they were not the club teams the usage would imply today. Rowland Bowen states in his history that the earliest usage of the term &quot;County Championship&quot; occurred in 1837 re a match between Kent and Nottingham Cricket Club which for the purposes of that match was called Nottingham&quot;shire&quot;. That may be so re the actual terminology but closer examination of the sources does indicate a much earlier expression of the idea.

The earliest known inter-county match was in 1709 between Kent and Surrey but match results are unknown until the 1720s. The first time a source refers to the superiority of one county is in respect of a match between Edwin Stead&#x27;s XI from Kent and Sir William Gage&#x27;s XI from Sussex at Penshurst Park in August 1728. Stead&#x27;s side won by an unknown margin and the source states that &quot;this was the third time this summer that the Kent men have been too expert for those of Sussex&quot;. The following year, Gage&#x27;s team &quot;turned the scales&quot; and defeated Stead&#x27;s side, prompting a source to remark that &quot;(the scale of victory) for some years past has been generally on the Kentish side&quot;. In 1730, a newspaper referred to the &quot;Kentish champions&quot;.

These statements indicate that inter-county matches had been played for many years previously and that there was keen rivalry with each team seeking ascendancy.

===Development of county cricket===
Inter-county cricket was popular throughout the 18th century although the best team, such as Kent in the 1740s or Hampshire in the days of the Hambledon Club, was usually acknowledged as such by being matched against an &quot;All England&quot; team. There were a number of contemporary allusions to the best county including some in verse, such as one by a Kent supporter celebrating a victory over Hampshire in terms of &quot;(we shall) bring down the pride of the Hambledon Club&quot;.

Analysis of 18th century matches has identified a number of strong teams who actually or effectively proclaimed their temporal superiority. The most successful county teams were Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex. But there was often a crossover between town and county with some strong local clubs tending at times to represent a whole county. Examples are London, which often played against county teams and was in some respects almost a county club in itself; Slindon, which was for a few years in the 1740s effectively representative of Sussex as a county; Dartford, often representative of Kent; and the Hambledon Club, certainly representative of Hampshire and also perhaps of Sussex. Other good county teams in the 18th century were Berkshire, Essex and Middlesex.

Using the same sort of reverse analysis, it is possible to compile a list of the most competitive teams from the recommencement of county cricket in 1825. Rowland Bowen published his ideas about this in the 1960s when he was the editor of the &quot;Cricket Quarterly&quot; periodical. He began by stating that Sussex was publicly acknowledged as the &quot;best county&quot; in the 1827 season when they played against All England in the roundarm trial matches, although the team&#x27;s involvement in these matches had more to do with the fact that Sussex was the prime mover in the &quot;roundarm revolution&quot;. Kent, which had a celebrated team at the time, has long been acknowledged as a champion county in most seasons of the 1840s but in other years there is no clear-cut contender.

===County clubs===
The middle years of the 19th century are the period of county club formation. So, when title &quot;claims&quot; were made on behalf of Sussex in 1826 and 1827, it was for the same loose association based on Brighton Cricket Club that had a successful season in 1792. But claims on behalf of Sussex from 1845 were by the Sussex county club, founded in 1839. A similar situation existed with both Kent and Surrey. Nottinghamshire is the only other claimant before the 1860s, starting in 1852, but all of its claims have been made by the county club which was founded in 1841.

As the popularity of organised cricket grew throughout England, more county clubs came into contention and, by the mid-1860s, they included the short-lived Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, Lancashire, Middlesex and Yorkshire. At this time and into the 1870s, the press began to advocate some form of league system and various journals and individuals, including W. G. Grace, began publishing their views about who was the champion in a given season. Grace became interested after the Gloucestershire club was founded in 1870, with himself as captain, and laid several claims to the championship during the 1870s. In the 1870s, it became widely accepted that the side with fewest losses should be the champions. Various lists of unofficial champions began to be compiled by the contemporary press and others, but they are not usually in complete agreement.

===The unofficial titles===
All &quot;titles&quot; claimed before 1864 are &quot;strictly unofficial&quot; and are based on (a) contemporary claims made by or on behalf of a particular team and recorded at the time; (b) reverse analysis performed by a writer who was trying to establish the best team in a given season by reference to the known fixtures and results. It must be stressed that the purpose of such lists when published has never been to ascribe any kind of ruling but rather to provoke discussion. No real credibility can be attached to such claims except to acknowledge that a team was especially strong over a number of years: e.g., Kent in the 1720s; London in the 1730s; Hampshire in the 1770s and 1780s; Sussex in the 1820s; Kent in the 1840s; and Surrey in the 1850s.

From 1864 to 1889, the county championship title remained unofficial except that the idea was widely promoted by individuals in the contemporary press and that had not happened hitherto apart from occasional points of view. Each journalist tended to have his own ideas about the calculation method and the matches to be included, but there was a certain amount of consensus in the main, generally favouring the team with fewest defeats. The list below gives the champions quoted by the most prominent sources, including W. G. Grace (1864‚Äì1889), &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; (1864‚Äì1889), &quot;John Lillywhite&#x27;s Cricketer&#x27;s Companion&quot; (1865‚Äì1884), &quot;James Lillywhite&#x27;s Cricketers&#x27; Annual&quot; (1871‚Äì1889) and &quot;&quot; (1882‚Äì1889).

* 1864 ‚Äì Surrey
* 1865 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire
* 1866 ‚Äì Middlesex
* 1867 ‚Äì Yorkshire
* 1868 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire (&quot;Wisden&quot;) &amp; Yorkshire (Grace)
* 1869 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire &amp; Yorkshire (shared by consensus)
* 1870 ‚Äì Yorkshire
* 1871 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire
* 1872 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire
* 1873 ‚Äì Gloucestershire &amp; Nottinghamshire (shared by consensus)
* 1874 ‚Äì Gloucestershire
* 1875 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire
* 1876 ‚Äì Gloucestershire
* 1877 ‚Äì Gloucestershire
* 1878 ‚Äì undecided
* 1879 ‚Äì Lancashire &amp; Nottinghamshire (shared by consensus)
* 1880 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire
* 1881 ‚Äì Lancashire
* 1882 ‚Äì Lancashire &amp; Nottinghamshire (shared by consensus)
* 1883 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire &amp; Yorkshire (shared by consensus)
* 1884 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire
* 1885 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire
* 1886 ‚Äì Nottinghamshire
* 1887 ‚Äì Surrey
* 1888 ‚Äì Surrey
* 1889 ‚Äì Lancashire, Nottinghamshire &amp; Surrey (shared by consensus)

The final tally over these 26 seasons was, therefore, Nottinghamshire (8 titles plus 7 shared); Gloucestershire (3/1); Surrey (3/1); Yorkshire (2/3); Lancashire (1/3); Middlesex (1/0).

===Qualification rules===

Prior to 1873, it was quite common for players to compete for both their county of birth and county of residence during a single season. Beginning in December 1872, three meetings were convened at which qualification rules were established, with the leading nine counties being represented either in writing or in person. At the last of these sessions, held at the Oval on 9 June 1873, it was decided:

* &quot;That no cricketer, whether amateur or professional, shall play for more than one county during the same season&quot;.
* &quot;Every cricketer born in one county and residing in another shall be free to choose at the commencement of each season for which of those counties he will play, and shall, during that season, play for the one county only&quot;.
* &quot;A cricketer shall be qualified to play for the county in which he is residing and has resided for the previous two years: or a cricketer may elect to play for the county in which his family home is, so long as it remains open to him as an occasional residence&quot;.
* &quot;That should any question arise as to the residential qualification, the same shall be left to the decision of the Marylebone Cricket Club&quot;.

===Newspaper &#x27;leagues&#x27;===
It was in the 1870s that newspapers began to print tables of inter-county results and then proclaim a champion on the basis of their chosen criteria. In Arthur Haygarth&#x27;s &quot;Scores and Biographies&quot;, reference is often made to &quot;least matches lost&quot; as a means of deciding the champion. This was a method that, in a modified form, permeated through to the official championship when one point was awarded for a win but one was deducted for a defeat. It was discontinued after 1909 as it was deemed to be inherently unsatisfactory and a points per win method replaced it in 1910.

As Derek Birley describes, the papers did not use standard criteria and so there were several seasons in which any title must be considered &quot;shared&quot;, as there was no universally recognised winner. With no consistency of approach, the issue inevitably led to argument, counter-arguments and confusion until the matter was taken in hand at the meeting of club secretaries in December 1889 where the official championship was constituted.

In Roy Webber&#x27;s &quot;The County Cricket Championship&quot;, he asserts that the championship &quot;is generally accepted as starting in the 1873 season but that is a convenient date decided upon many years later&quot; because 1873 was &quot;the first season in which rules of county qualification were in operation&quot;. Webber acknowledges the difficulties posed from 1873 to 1890 by varying programmes with some county clubs playing many more matches than others. For example, in 1874 when Derbyshire was held by some to have won the title, they played only four matches while Yorkshire played twelve. A list of champions for the period would be subjective and in most seasons there would be strongly competing claims. In general, it may be asserted that Gloucestershire with all three Grace brothers were the strongest team in most of the 1870s; Nottinghamshire were in the ascendancy from about 1879 to 1886; and then Surrey from 1887 through the start of the official championship in 1890.

===First official competition===
When the annual meeting of county club secretaries was held at Lord&#x27;s on 10 December 1889, their purpose was to decide on a fixture programme for the 1890 season. As reported by &quot;&quot;:
&quot;While the secretaries were engaged in making the fixtures the representatives of the eight leading counties ‚Äì Nottinghamshire, Surrey, Lancashire, Kent, Middlesex, Gloucestershire, Yorkshire, and Sussex ‚Äì held a private meeting to discuss the method by which the county championship should in future be decided. The meeting was, we understand, not quite unanimous, but a majority were in favour of ignoring drawn games altogether and settling the question of championship by wins and losses. As it was agreed to abide by the views of the majority, this decision was accepted as final.Subsequently representatives of the following eight minor counties ‚Äì Derbyshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Hampshire, Somersetshire, Staffordshire, Durham and Essex ‚Äì held a similar meeting in private, and unanimously decided to apply the same rule to minor county cricket&quot;.

The first-ever official cricket County Championship match began on 12 May 1890: Yorkshire beat Gloucestershire by eight wickets at Bristol. James Cranston (Gloucestershire) scored the first century in the competition. The final positions in 1890 were based on number of wins minus the number of losses. Later, a points system was introduced but it has been subject to several variations.

===Expansion and points systems===
In the 1891 season, Somerset competed in the championship and in 1895 Derbyshire, Essex, Hampshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire all joined; the rules were changed so each side had to play at least 16 matches per season. Until World War II, counties played differing numbers of matches, except that all counties were required to play 28 matches in each season from 1929 to 1932 inclusive. When the championship resumed in 1946, teams played 26 matches per season, and the pattern of a fixed number of matches has continued since then, although the number has varied, but again there was an exception. From 1960 to 1962 inclusive, counties could choose whether to play 28 or 32 matches.

The original points system was simply wins minus losses but with the expansion in 1895 the points system was modified so that the ratio of points to &quot;finished games&quot; (games minus draws) decided the final positions.

In 1910 the system was modified again so that the order was based on ratio of matches won to matches played, while from 1911 to 1967 a variety of systems were used that generally relied on points for wins and for first innings leads in games left unfinished. Since 1968, the basis has been wins (increased from 10 points in 1968, to 12 in 1976, to 16 in 1981, then back down to 12 in 1999, up to 14 in 2004 and currently 16) and &quot;bonus points&quot;, which are earned for scoring a certain number of runs or taking a certain number of wickets in the first 110 overs of each first innings (the number of overs has changed at various times, but has been 110 since 2010). In an effort to prevent early finishes, points have been awarded for draws since 1996. From 1974 to 1981 there was a limit of 200 overs for the first two innings; the team batting first were restricted to 100 overs and any unused overs were added to those allowed to the team batting second.

Of the current 18 sides in County Cricket the remaining four joined at the following dates:

* Worcestershire in 1899 (did not play in 1919)
* Northamptonshire in 1905
* Glamorgan in 1921
* Durham in 1992

An invitation in 1921 to Buckinghamshire was declined, due to lack of proper playing facilities, and an application by Devon in 1948 to join was rejected.

In the 21st century, questions have been raised about the future of the County Championship in the light of the shaky financial structure of many counties, poor attendances and the rise of Twenty20 cricket. Doubts have been raised over many decades concerning the competition&#x27;s viability, yet it still survives. &quot;The Changing Face of Cricket&quot; (1966) by Sir Learie Constantine and Denzil Batchelor, made negative predictions about county cricket.

===Recent developments===
All matches before 1988 were scheduled for three days, normally of a nominal six hours each plus intervals, but often with the first two days lengthened by up to an hour and the final day shortened, so that teams with fixtures elsewhere on the following day could travel at sensible hours. The exception to this was the 1919 season, when there was an experiment with two-day matches played over longer hours, up to nine o&#x27;clock in the evening in mid-summer. This experiment was not repeated. From 1988 to 1992 some matches were played over four days, with each county playing six four-day and sixteen three-day games. From 1993 onwards, all matches have been scheduled for four days. In 2000, the championship adopted a two-divisional format with promotion and relegation each season. The ECB announced that, from 2017, Division One would contain eight teams and Division Two ten teams, with only one team being promoted from Division Two in 2016. The two-up, two-down arrangement applied for 2017 and 2018, but it was then decided to reverse the sizes of the divisions with effect from 2020, with three teams to be promoted and only one relegated at the end of the 2019 season.

From 2016 to 2019 there was no mandatory toss, with the away side having the option to bowl first. If the away side declined to bowl first, the toss still took place. This regulation was introduced on an experimental basis for the 2016 season but retained from 2017 to 2019 after being judged a success in its objectives of making games last longer and encouraging spin bowling. The mandatory toss was reinstated from the 2020 season with the ECB taking the view that increased pitch penalties and changes to the seam of the ball would improve the balance between batting and bowling.

The competition was not held in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, being replaced by an abbreviated competition called the Bob Willis Trophy.

In 2021 for one season only, there was a revised Championship format, with the aim of mitigating the impact of COVID-19. This consisted of three seeded groups of six teams playing home and away, after which the final three divisions were allocated, and the teams played the four teams they had not already played in their new division home and away. The top team in the top division at the end of the season were crowned Champions, with the top two teams in the top division going on to play for the Bob Willis Trophy in a five-day final at Lords.

=== Stadiums and locations ===


==Competition format==

===Points system===
The County Championship works on a points system, with the winner being the team with most points in the first division. The points are currently awarded as follows, with a draw being increased to 8 points from 2024 after a reduction to 5 points in 2023:

Win: 16 points + bonus points 
Tie: 8 points + bonus points 
Draw: 8 points + bonus points
Loss: Bonus points

Bonus points may be earned during the initial 110 overs of each team&#x27;s first innings, and are retained whatever the match outcome. The minimum number of runs required to earn batting points was increased from 200 to 250 in 2023.

===Deductions===
Occasionally, a team may have points deducted. Reasons for points deductions are as follows:

*Fielding an unregistered player: Points were deducted from Lancashire and Sussex in 1978, and Middlesex in 1981. In each case, the county had played an unregistered player in one match, and all points awarded in that match were deducted.
*Poor pitches: Penalties for poor pitches were initially introduced at 25 points (one more than the points for a win with maximum bonus points at the time). The first team to lose points for a poor pitch were Essex in 1989, a deduction which cost them first place in the championship. In later years, smaller penalties were introduced. In 2011, Warwickshire, Hampshire and Kent were all docked 8 points for poor pitches at Edgbaston, the Rose Bowl and Canterbury respectively. In 2019 Somerset were deducted 24 points, of which 12 were applied in the 2021 competition and 12 were suspended for the 2022 competition, for a poor pitch in their title-deciding game with Essex.
*Slow over rates: Deductions for a slow over rate were introduced in 2001, units of 0.25 points per over short of the target number in any match. The penalty was increased to 0.5 points per over in 2004, and to 1 point per over in 2008.
*Ball-tampering: Surrey lost 8 points for ball-tampering in 2005 and were relegated at the end of that season.
*Breach of salary cap: Durham were subject to a 2.5-point penalty in the 2013 County Championship, as well as penalties in the limited over competitions, for breach of the salary cap in 2012. Despite this penalty, Durham still won the County Championship in 2013.
*Discipline: Leicestershire were fined 16 points in 2015 &quot;in respect of five or more separate occasions when their players committed fixed penalty offences in a 12-month period.&quot; Leicestershire were fined 16 points in 2017 after a further five offences in the previous 12 months.
*Financial issues: As well as being demoted from Division One, Durham were subject to a 48-point penalty in Division Two in the 2017 County Championship and penalties in the limited over competitions. This was for requiring financial assistance from the ECB. Middlesex had a points deduction imposed in each county competition equal to one win imposed in September 2023, suspended until 31 October 2025, for breaching ECB financial regulations.
* Non-regulation equipment: In 2024, Essex had 12 points deducted because Feroze Khushi used an oversize bat in a game against Nottinghamshire.
*Other: Yorkshire were deducted 48 points in 2023 by the Cricket Discipline Commission for their handling of the Yorkshire County Cricket Club racism scandal.

===Tie-breakers===

If any sides have equal points, tie-breakers are applied in the following order: most wins, fewest losses, team achieving most points in contests between teams level on points, most wickets taken, most runs scored.

==Results==

===Official county champions===
Yorkshire have won the most County Championships with 32 outright titles and one shared. Three current first-class counties (Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire and Somerset) have never won the official title, although Gloucestershire had claim to three unofficial titles in the 1870s.

===Promoted and relegated===
Since 2000, there have been two divisions, and promotion and relegation between them. Every county has experienced both divisions at some stage. For the 2020 and 2021 seasons, there was no promotion or relegation due to the revised formats brought around by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Durham finished fourth in 2016 but were relegated as a penalty by the ECB over financial issues, replacing Hampshire who finished eighth.

===Wooden spoons===
Since the expansion of the Championship from 9 counties to 14 in 1895, the wooden spoon for finishing bottom has been &#x27;won&#x27; by the teams shown in the table below. Lancashire, Middlesex, and Surrey have never finished bottom. Leicestershire have shared last place twice, with Hampshire and Somerset.

==Records==

<text>Thierachern is a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

==History==
Thierachern is first mentioned in 1250 as &quot;Tierachern&quot;.

The area around Thierachern was occupied during the neolithic era, the Bronze Age and the La T√®ne era. The remains of a Roman era settlement and graves were discovered under the village church. Additional Roman or early medieval stone lined cists were found near Egg. Other graves, of an indeterminate age, have been found in Oberen Hasliholz, by Halterain and by Wahlen. All the prehistoric artifacts indicate that the area has had a long history of human habitation.

The village first appears in historic records as a part of the &quot;Herrschaft&quot; of Str√§ttligen. The village church of St. Martin was first mentioned in 1228 as one of the 12 Lake Thun churches in the Str√§ttliger Chronicle. The current church dates to 1706-08 when Abraham D√ºnz the Younger rebuilt the old building. When the Str√§ttligen family died out in 1349, the village was inherited and sold to several lords over the following centuries. In 1594 the von May family from Bern acquired the village.

<text>The Guadalupe caracara (Caracara lutosa) or mourning caracara is an extinct bird of prey belonging to the falcon family (Falconidae). It was, together with the closely related crested caracara (&quot;Caracara plancus&quot;), formerly placed in the genus &quot;Polyborus&quot;. It was also known as the quelili or the calalie.

==Distribution and taxonomy==
This species inhabited Mexico&#x27;s Guadalupe Island until the beginning of the 20th century. The crested caracara is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;Guadalupe caracara&quot;, because the extinct birds were formerly considered a subspecies of the extant taxon. They were reinstated as a full species in 2000.

==History==
Described as &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;vicious&quot; by early observers, it was driven to extinction by a hunting and poisoning campaign led by goat herders on Guadalupe Island. As described by Edward Palmer:

==Conservation==
In 1876 the species was common throughout the island. However, in March 1897, only one bird was encountered, but additional members of the species survived. On 1 December 1900 collector Rollo Beck encountered 11 and preserved nine as scientific specimens. He may have shot the last of the caracaras on Guadalupe Island, believing from their fearlessness and ease of finding them that they were common. There was one more (unconfirmed) sighting in 1903; the bird was certainly gone by 1906.

The Guadalupe caracara is one of the few species that were intentionally rendered extinct by humans. In its particular case, it was demanded by goat farmers that the birds were to be killed off as they occasionally fed on young goats (though the role of the caracara as a predator of goats was much exaggerated). It stands to note that its erstwhile home was at that time being devastated by tens of thousands of goats gone feral, leading to the extinction of several endemic species caused by the near-total destruction of habitat.

In an apparent case of coextinction, the ischnoceran louse &quot;Acutifrons caracarensis&quot; is only known from the Guadalupe caracara.

Around 35 specimens (skins, skeletons and two eggs) remain in public collections today. Specimens are available for display in Chicago, Washington, and London.

<text>Michael R. Douglas (born November 19, 1961) is an American theoretical physicist, best known for his work in string theory and mathematical physics.

==Biography==
Douglas was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the son of Nancy and Ronald G. Douglas, a mathematician specializing in operator algebras. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Harvard University. He then went to Caltech and received a PhD in physics in 1988 under John Schwarz, one of the developers and leading researchers in superstring theory.

After completing his PhD, Douglas was a postdoc at the University of Chicago for one year, then moved to Rutgers University in 1989 with Dan Friedan and Steve Shenker to help start the New High Energy Theory Center (NHETC). He was promoted to assistant professor in 1990 but spent his first year visiting the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He became an associate professor at Rutgers in 1995, and left for a year in 1997‚Äì1998 to take up a permanent position at the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques. He then returned to Rutgers and in 2000 became the director of the NHETC.
In 2008, Douglas moved from Rutgers to become the first permanent member of the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, a research center at Stony Brook University.
In 2012, Douglas left Stony Brook University to work for Renaissance Technologies, the famous quantitative hedge fund. 
He returned to academia in 2020 and is presently a long-term visitor at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications at Harvard University, doing research on machine learning and its applications in scientific research.

Douglas is best known for the development of matrix models (the first nonperturbative formulations of string theory), for his work on Dirichlet branes and on noncommutative geometry in string theory, and for the development of the statistical approach to string phenomenology. He was on the team (led by Gerald J. Sussman) that built the Digital Orrery, a special-purpose computer for computations in celestial mechanics, and maintains an active interest in computer science. He is also very active in organizing schools and workshops, for example at Les Houches, Cargese, and the KITP Santa Barbara.

Douglas received the 2000 Sackler Prize in theoretical physics and has been a Gordon Moore Visiting Scholar at Caltech and a Clay Mathematics Institute Mathematical Emissary. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
He has a long association with the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques, as a Louis Michel Visiting Professor from 2000 to 2008, and as chairman and President of the Friends of IHES from 2013 to 2021.

Douglas is married and has two children. His wife, Nina Ilieva Douglas, is an artist.
Her sculpture of Alexander Grothendieck is on permanent display at the IHES.

<text>Sarah Knuckey is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Jeph Loeb and artist David Brewer, the character first appeared in &quot;Cable&quot; #15 (September 1994). Knuckey belongs to the subspecies of humans called mutants who are born with superhuman abilities. She is known under the codename Marrow. She is able to make her bones grow out of her skin. These can be removed from her body, providing her with potential knives, clubs, and body armor.

As a child, Knuckey was taken in by the Morlocks, a band of grotesque-looking mutants who hid in tunnels beneath New York City. As a young adult, she formed the violent splinter cell Gene Nation until, under the orders of Morlock leader Callisto, she joined the X-Men to redeem herself. She made progress controlling her powers and learning a moral code, but eventually fell in with the paramilitary group Weapon X.

==Publication history==

Sarah Knuckey debuted in &quot;Cable&quot; #15 (September 1994), created by writer Jeph Loeb and artist David Brewer. She later appeared as Marrow in the 1995 &quot;X-Men Prime&quot; one-shot. She appeared in the 2000 &quot;Spidey/Marrow&quot; one-shot, the 2006 &quot;X-Factor&quot; series, and the 2019 &quot;Marauders&quot; series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
As a child, Sarah was one of the underground-dwelling Morlocks. During the Mutant Massacre that devastated the Morlock community, she witnessed the mauling of Angel by the Marauders. She was saved by Gambit, who was then not yet known by the X-Men. Years later, most of the surviving Morlocks (including Sarah) were apparently killed by Mikhail Rasputin, although they were actually brought to another dimension. There, Mikhail had established a citadel for himself on the top of a massive hill. The Social Darwinist philosophy of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; was the only thing which governed the society. If someone could reach the summit of the hill, they were considered &quot;fit&quot; and worthy of being part of Gene Nation.

The former Morlock leader Callisto cared for Marrow during this period and displayed a maternal attitude towards the young mutant, although the two are not known to be biologically related. When her powers fully manifested, she was forced to &quot;up the hill&quot;, becoming more savage and killing her opponents to survive. When she managed to reach the top, Mikhail considered her fit to join his elite fighting team Gene Nation, which eventually became a terrorist group whose mission was to punish humans for their hatred towards mutants.

===Gene Nation===
In that harsh dimension, time passed quickly, and when Marrow and several other members of Gene Nation (of which she had become leader) returned to Earth, they discovered only a few years had passed during their absence. Marrow and the other members of Gene Nation began a homicidal terrorist campaign against surface-dwelling humans. After inconclusive battles with the X-Men and Generation X, Gene Nation was defeated by the X-Men. Marrow wired a time bomb to her own heart to force the X-Man Storm, who had herself led the Morlocks in the past, to either yield or kill her; Storm tore out Marrow&#x27;s heart. However, due to Marrow&#x27;s possession of two hearts to compensate for her random bone growth and superhuman regenerative abilities, she survived. Marrow eventually reunited with Callisto, and while they continued their terrorist activities, Callisto tried to hold back Marrow&#x27;s more violent ways.

===X-Men===
After a battle with Cable, Marrow and Callisto returned to seclusion. When Callisto was injured by a Prime Sentinel during the events of , she directed Marrow to seek the aid of the X-Men. After teaming up with Iceman and Cecilia Reyes, Marrow went to the Xavier Institute. She joined the X-Men for a time, coming under the mentorship of Wolverine and flirting with her teammate Cannonball. When the team came under the attack of the Shadow King, Marrow managed to resist when the Shadow King tempted and tortured her in an attempt to gain her loyalty. She also helped Cannonball resist by viciously destroying the illusion of his abusive father. Cannonball was shaken by seeing Marrow slay the illusion of his parent.

Marrow also participated in the fight against the returning N&#x27;Garai, extra-dimensional monsters who were loose on the grounds of the X-Mansion. She saved fellow X-Men Cecilia Reyes by impaling one of the creatures threatening her.

Around this time Marrow would confront Spider-Man, because both were interested in investigating a unique type of kidnapping. Eyewitnesses reported the victims literally dragged into the sewers, something which of course interested Marrow, because of her Morlock heritage. Investigating the disappearances, they discovered them to be the work of the vampire-like being known as Hunger, who was swiftly defeated in a confrontation with Spider-Man.

During an adventure in another dimension, Gambit, unable to control his powers, accidentally injured Marrow. She later traveled to the past with the X-Men, ending up on the Skrull homeworld a short time before the cosmic entity known as Galactus would destroy it. A medical device gave her more control over her powers, giving her a &quot;prettier&quot; appearance. The suspension-properties of a captured Skrull rescue ship allowed her and her fellow X-Men to make the journey back to Earth in real time, without aging at all. Thus, for a while, two Marrows existed in the time stream, one on Earth and one in space.

The change of her features led to major softening of her personality, to the point where she reached out to Jubilee following Wolverine&#x27;s disappearance in the lead up to &quot;The Twelve&quot; storyline. She also tried to cheer up returning X-Man Colossus in a scheme involving his artwork and her storytelling.

Marrow left the X-Men during the six-month gap preceding the &quot;X-Men Revolution&quot;, though her reasons for doing so are unclear.

She was next seen brainwashed by S.H.I.E.L.D. under the alias of &quot;Sarah Rushman&quot; used as a sleeper agent. Her mission was to terminate rogue Life Model Decoys. She had a split personality (mutant Marrow and human teenager Sarah) and had to be periodically injected to keep her implanted memory. With Spider-Man&#x27;s help (he briefly dated her Sarah personality as Mary Jane was believed dead at this point), she freed herself from SHIELD&#x27;s control by faking a suicide.

===Weapon X===
Marrow was later recruited by the most recent incarnation of Weapon X, who again normalized her appearance and her powers. However, she eventually betrayed Weapon X upon discovering their anti-mutant nature. She used the remnants of Cable&#x27;s Underground to reform the Gene Nation terrorist group and, as their leader, led several terrorist attacks on Weapon X until the rest of the group was slaughtered by Agent Zero. Agent Zero left her alone, not wanting her to become a martyr, but he warned her that he would come after her again after he had hunted down the remaining members of Gene Nation.

===Decimation===

Marrow was next seen as a spokeswoman of a band of Morlocks after M-Day. She gave an interview to Sally Floyd for her ex-mutant diaries. Marrow remains underground to protect and give hope to the few mutants who remain and those who fear going to the surface to live normal lives. Mike Marts, editor for the X-Men comic books, confirmed in an interview that although Sarah retains some of the physical attributes of her mutation, her actual mutant powers disappeared during Decimation.

===X-Cell===
Marrow later turns up as a member of X-Cell, a terrorist group of former mutants believing that M-Day was caused by the U.S. government. As part of X-Cell, Marrow fought M and Siryn of X-Factor Investigations and after a turn of events in which she and Callisto learned the truth about who is responsible for M-Day, she turned against X-Cell supporter Quicksilver. Both heavily injured each other with a knife wound during the fight. Afterwards, she and Callisto managed to escape X-Factor and the government through the sewers.

===X-Force===
In Feb. 2014, Marrow returns as a member of a new X-Force team, along with a semblance of her powers intact. After some examination from Doctor Nemesis, Marrow is revealed to be not a mutant. It has since been revealed that Marrow wasn&#x27;t abducted at all. She willingly approached Volga, the one responsible for giving former mutants their powers back, for an experimental procedure to restore her power. At this point Marrow was already pregnant and despite the great risks this posed for her child, she accepted. The procedure was successful, and Marrow&#x27;s powers were restored at the cost of her child, and she was left for dead in Alexandria during the Alexandria Incident. She was eventually found by Cable, who provided her with an inhibitor collar built by Doctor Nemesis to suppress her memories and control her powers.

===Secret Empire===
In the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Marrow is affiliated with New Tian and fights along other mutants. Afterwards, Sarah joins Magneto&#x27;s new Brotherhood of Mutants. She and others under his service attack an anti-mutant rally in Washington DC. Some time later she appears at a self-help group therapy session for mutants who suffered from debilitating appearances due to their abilities.

===Disassembled===
After a massive reality distorting event caused by X-Man had left much of the mutant population decimated once again, Marrow and a couple of other mutants work with Emma Frost as debutantes in her new Hellfire Club. But they are soon beset by the O.N.E., now under command of the bigoted and corrupt Robert Callahan as part of his campaign of registering, incarcerating and modifying mutants for the purpose of exterminating other mutants. The duplicitous director coerces the Black King into tracking other mutants for his minions to round up in his government sanctioned facilities while under threat of execution. But Emma works with Marrow the others to contact the last remaining X-Men to deal with the O.N.E.

===Dawn of X===
Somewhere later down the line; after the new mutant nation of Krakoa was established and declared its independence upon the world stage, Professor X offers amnesty to all of mutant kind in the form of an invite to their personal island nation. Even the more socially abrasive amongst Homo Superior are welcomed amongst their growing numbers, as Marrow could be seen amongst an enclave of villainous mutants who accepted his summons. She is now a duly recognized citizen of the mutant nation.

==Powers and abilities==
Sarah Knuckey possesses the ability to enhance the growth of her skeletal structure. She uses her power in many ways, including the creation of knuckle guards, spears, and projectile spikes. She also has a healing factor and enhanced immune system, much in the same vein as Wolverine since every time a bone is ripped out a wound which remains closes itself soon after. Her bones seem to be much more durable than normal; she had easily survived heavy hits in multiple areas of her body. Flag-Smasher hit her twice on the head with his mace without much damage, and Sabretooth likewise threw her against a wall without harm. Knuckey also jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge twice (something that would have resulted in death or at least crippling injuries) without any major damage, being able to walk away from the scene. She possesses two hearts to compensate for her random bone growth as well, so when Storm ripped one out she was able to survive.

Knuckey is also more agile and stronger than the average woman in her age group and physical condition, and has excellent tracking skills.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated Sarah Knuckey embodies &quot;superhero body horror at its finest,&quot; saying Swiss artist Hans Ruedi Giger would have appreciated the character. Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Sarah Knuckey a &quot;role model&quot; and a &quot;truly heroic&quot; female character. Amer Sawan of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; noted the similarities between the powers of Sarah Knuckey and the newly-acquired abilities of Captain Boomerang from DC Comics. 

=== Impact ===
Sarah Knuckey placed 8th in a popularity contest held by Marvel Comics in 2021, which served to determine who would be the final member of a new X-Men team that would debut during the Hellfire Gala storyline.

==Other versions==

=== &quot;X-Men: Age of Apocalypse&quot; ===

=== &quot;Age of X&quot; ===

<doc id="683611" wikidata="Q5282221" url="?curid=683611" title="Dishoarding">
<text>In economics, dishoarding is the opposite of hoarding. In the case of hoarding emphasized most by macroeconomics, someone increases his or her holdings of money as an asset (for safety, to diversify assets, because of expected returns, or because of irrationality) rather than using money simply as a tool for buying goods and services (a medium of exchange). (See liquidity preference.) Thus, dishoarding would refer to the reduction of one&#x27;s asset holdings of money.

== Definition ==
When money or goods that have been kept are brought back into the economy, for example when people invest or spend money rather than save it. It can also be defined as the activity of investing money or selling gold, silver, etc. after a period during which investors have saved them.

In terms of Keynesian theory, dishoarding may be described as a reduction in liquidity preference to satisfy speculative motive of demand for money.

== Loanable Funds ==
Dishoarding and hoarding are now usually described in terms of balances of money held by people. A difference is drawn between &#x27;active&#x27; money in circulation, financing current transactions in the market place. In comparison to &#x27;inactive&#x27; money being held in idle balances. A rise in dishoarding means that the community wants to hold a smaller amount of money in idle balances, thus increasing purchases of products (without changing its expenditure of current income).

According to neoclassical, loanable funds theory of interest. Dishoarding or dishoarded money is an important source of the supply of loanable funds. An increase in dishoarding while there is no change in the demand for loanable funds, will cause the rate of interest to fall. Due to which there is an increase in demand for securities, causing their prices to rise and the rate of interest to fall.

Customarily, people may also dishoard money from the past hoardings due to a higher rate of interest. Due to this higher interest rate, idle cash balances of the past become active balances at present. This means they are usable for investment. As well as more securities being purchased for the higher return available. Where as in if the interest rate is low, dishoarding would be negligible.

In the words of Professor Kenneth K Kurihara (1910-1972), &quot;Hoarding may be defined as the people&#x27;s desire to hoard wealth in the form of money.&quot; When rate of interest is high, people lend the hoarded money and thus their savings.

== Interest Rates ==
Interest rates and Inflation are directly linked and consistently mentioned in macroeconomics. The majority of countries around the world all have a central bank. Such as in the United States, the Federal Reserve sets interest rates ‚Äì the amount of interest paid by a borrower to a lender. ‚Äì Similar to the United Kingdom where The Bank of England sets them.

In general, when interest rates are lowered, more people are able to borrow more money. As well as there being less of an incentive for people to keep money that they were hoarded before due to their being more of a financial yield. This results in consumers dishoarding money that was previously hoarded. This causes an economy to grow and inflation to increase. The opposite effect takes place when interest rates are increased; as there is more incentive for consumers to hoard their money due to the financial gain, which leads to less spending. Resulting in an economy slowing and inflation decreasing. Central banks make these decisions according to different factors of an economy. This mainly being the inflation rate, although the impact upon economic growth and unemployment must also be considered.

== Gold ==

The gold market is a good place to look at in order to understand the concept of dishoarding.

The selling back of physical gold due to economic distress, profit, lack of performance or even political reasons. This now commonly happens on the gold market.

In the case of history, the reasoning for dishoarding was due to distress. As the gold price was fixed.

French aristocrats that went to London in order to get away from the French Revolution in 1789 flooded the market with gold coins. Gold also came out of Russia in the years following the revolution, as well as more recently from Vietnam once the Americans withdrew in 1975. As well as Iran after The Shah&#x27;s overthrow and Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion.

On an International scale during the twentieth century, price fluctuations caused dishoarding. In the early 1930s dishoarding in India was due to the gold price rising to $35 per ounce as well as economic distress. The vast fluctuations in the gold price since 1970 have also motivated making profit on gold instead of distress selling from the Middle East and South ‚Äì East Asia where high carat gold jewellery was sold at a low profit margin and sold when prices rose sharply. Up to150, a tonne (4.8 m oz) of gold was dishoarded in these regions in 1974, 1980, 1986 and to a lower degree in 1993.

In 1994, vast hoarding also took place in Turkey due to the weak local currency, while more significant dishoarding took place in 1997 ‚Äì 1998 during the Asian currency crisis when South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand collectively dishoarded hundreds of tonnes of gold.

The change in direction of a typical trend concerning imports can have an ample effect on a market within a short period. The first sign of dishoarding consists of when the local price in markets such as Egypt, Taiwan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia goes to a discount on the London price. If this stays the same for a week or two, shipment of metal back to refineries in Europe will begin. In recent years, the French have started dishoarding their traditional stock of bars and coins. As the younger generation does not feel the need to hold onto inherited gold. In 2000, similar dishoarding took place in other European countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Austria. The Net dishoarding of physical metal during the year 2000 in Europe is estimated to have added 105 to 145 tonnes (3.4 to 4.7 million oz) to the world supply by GFMS.

<text>Montcuq ( or ; Lengadocian: &quot;Montcuc&quot;) is a town and former commune in the Lot department in south-western France, lying outside Cahors. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Montcuq-en-Quercy-Blanc. Its residents are known as &quot;Montcuquois&quot;.

The town remains vibrant and a popular tourist destination, in part because its name is homophonic with &quot;mon cul&quot;, meaning &quot;my arse&quot;.

Montcuq still has a rich agricultural industry, and is known for its manufacture of meringues and &quot;gaufres de Saint Daumes&quot; waffles.

The town&#x27;s name could derive from the Latin &quot;Mont Circus Vallium&quot;, &quot;Mont Cuneus&quot; or &quot;montem cuci&quot;, meaning &quot;cuckoo mountain&quot;.

==History==
The town&#x27;s foundation dates back to at least Roman times.

A stronghold of the Cathars, Montcuq received its charter from Raymond VI in the 12th century. On 1 June 1212 Simon de Montfort took the castle after it had been deserted by its defenders, and gave it to Beaudouin, half-brother of the Count of Toulouse, an ally of the Crusaders.

On 17 February 1214 Beaudouin marched on the Ch√¢teau de Lolmie, and after a short battle was arrested by Ratier de Castelnau, despite also being an ally of Montfort. Transported to Montcuq and deprived of food, he refused to order his soldiers to surrender. The garrison offered to surrender if their lives were spared, but they were soon massacred. Beaudouin was taken to Montauban and hanged at his brother&#x27;s command.

After the Treaty of Meaux in 1229, the French king rebuilt the walls of both the town and castle. Only the keep of the castle remains nowadays.

The castle was retaken several times by the English during the 14th century, and in the 16th century was plundered by the Huguenots.

Singer, actor and pop/rock musician Nino Ferrer lived in a &quot;bastide&quot; near Montcuq.

English writer, comedian and musician Neil Innes lived in Montcuq during the last years of his life, before passing away there in December 2019.

==Geography==
The village lies in the middle of the commune, above the left bank of the Barguelonnette, which flows southwestward through the commune. The S√©oune forms part of the commune&#x27;s northern border.

==In popular culture==
In a well-known skit (1976), Daniel Pr√©vost in the TV show &quot;&quot; animated by Jacques Martin, visited the town and joked by asking the &quot;Montcuquois&quot; questions such as: &quot;Is Montcuq well lit? Because I&#x27;ve heard that it is sometimes gloomy...&quot;. In French, Montcuq is pronounced the same as &quot;mon cul&quot;, meaning &quot;my arse&quot;. However the locals used to speak Occitan in which language the village name, when pronounced correctly, has the &#x27;q&#x27; pronounced as &#x27;k&#x27;, Mon-cuk.

In 2007, Hasbro, the company that manufactures the Monopoly game in France, had the idea to have the online community choose the cities that will appear on the new version of the game. Montcuq by far won the most votes (52879 votes), well ahead of Dunkirk with 30640 votes and Reims (20727 votes). Hasbro, however, decided it had &quot;played long enough with web 2.0&quot; and had &quot;decided to maintain its editorial line and to develop products that fit a commercial demand&quot;, so decided to out Montcuq from the board game. Hasbro has nonetheless decided to issue an all-Montcuq edition.

<doc id="683621" wikidata="Q1263570" url="?curid=683621" title="Duckworth‚ÄìLewis‚ÄìStern method">
<text>The Duckworth‚ÄìLewis‚ÄìStern method (DLS method or DLS) previously known as the Duckworth‚ÄìLewis method (D/L) is a mathematical formulation designed to calculate the target score (number of runs needed to win) for the team batting second in a limited overs cricket match interrupted by weather or other circumstances. The method was devised by two English statisticians, Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis, and was formerly known as the Duckworth‚ÄìLewis method (D/L). It was introduced in 1997, and adopted officially by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1999. After the retirement of both Duckworth and Lewis, the Australian statistician Steven Stern became the custodian of the method, which was renamed to its current title in November 2014. In 2014, he refined the model to better fit modern scoring trends, especially in T20 cricket, resulting in the updated Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method. This refined method remains the standard for handling rain-affected matches in international cricket today.

The target score in cricket matches without interruptions is one more than the number of runs scored by the team that batted first. When overs are lost, setting an adjusted target for the team batting second is not as simple as reducing the run target proportionally to the loss in overs, because a team with ten wickets in hand and 25 overs to bat can play more aggressively than if they had ten wickets and a full 50 overs, for example, and can consequently achieve a higher run rate. The DLS method is an attempt to set a statistically fair target for the second team&#x27;s innings, which is the same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.

==History and creation==
Various different methods had been used previously to resolve rain-affected cricket matches, with the most common being the Average Run Rate method, and later, the Most Productive Overs method. 

While simple in nature, these methods had intrinsic flaws and were easily exploitable:
* The Average Run Rate method took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, but simply reflected their scoring rate when the match was interrupted. If the team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate with no regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, meaning any comparison with the team batting first would be flawed. 
* The Most Productive Overs method not only took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, but also effectively penalised the team batting second for good bowling by ignoring their best overs in setting the revised target.
* Both of these methods also produced revised targets that frequently altered the balance of the match, and they took no account of the match situation at the time of the interruption.

The D/L method was devised by two British statisticians, Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis, as a result of the outcome of the semi-final in the 1992 World Cup between England and South Africa, where the Most Productive Overs method was used. When rain stopped play for 12 minutes, South Africa needed 22 runs from 13 balls, but when play resumed, the revised target left South Africa needing 21 runs from one ball, a reduction of only one run compared to a reduction of two overs, and a virtually impossible target given that the maximum score from one ball is generally six runs. Duckworth said, &quot;I recall hearing Christopher Martin-Jenkins on radio saying &#x27;surely someone, somewhere could come up with something better&#x27; and I soon realised that it was a mathematical problem that required a mathematical solution.&quot; The D/L method avoids this flaw: in this match, the revised D/L target of 236 would have left South Africa needing four to tie or five to win from the final ball.

The D/L method was first used in international cricket on 1 January 1997 in the second match of the Zimbabwe versus England ODI series, which Zimbabwe won by seven runs. The D/L method was formally adopted by the ICC in 1999 as the standard method of calculating target scores in rain-shortened one-day matches.

==Theory==
===Calculation summary===
The essence of the D/L method is &#x27;resources&#x27;. Each team is taken to have two &#x27;resources&#x27; to use to score as many runs as possible: the number of overs they have to receive; and the number of wickets they have in hand. At any point in any innings, a team&#x27;s ability to score more runs depends on the combination of these two resources they have left. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team&#x27;s final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.

The D/L method converts all possible combinations of overs (or, more accurately, balls) and wickets left into a combined resources remaining percentage figure (with 50 overs and 10 wickets = 100%), and these are all stored in a published table or computer. The target score for the team batting second (&#x27;Team 2&#x27;) can be adjusted up or down from the total the team batting first (&#x27;Team 1&#x27;) achieved using these resource percentages, to reflect the loss of resources to one or both teams when a match is shortened one or more times.

In the version of D/L most commonly in use in international and first-class matches (the &#x27;Professional Edition&#x27;), the target for Team 2 is adjusted simply in proportion to the two teams&#x27; resources, i.e.

: formula_1

If, as usually occurs, this &#x27;par score&#x27; is a non-integer number of runs, then Team 2&#x27;s target to win is this number rounded up to the next integer, and the score to tie (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. If Team 2 reaches or passes the target score, then they have won the match. If the match ends when Team 2 has exactly met (but not passed) the par score then the match is a tie. If Team 2 fail to reach the par score then they have lost.

For example, if a rain delay means that Team 2 only has 90% of resources available, and Team 1 scored 254 with 100% of resources available, then 254¬†√ó¬†90%¬†/¬†100%¬†=¬†228.6, so Team 2&#x27;s target is 229, and the score to tie is 228. The actual resource values used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available, so a computer which has this software loaded must be used.

If it is a 50-over match and Team 1 completed its innings uninterrupted, then they had 100% resource available to them, so the formula simplifies to:

: formula_2

===Summary of impact on Team 2&#x27;s target===
*If there is a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced but still the same as each other, then D/L makes no change to the target score, because both sides are aware of the total number of overs and wickets throughout their innings, thus they will have the same resources available.
*Team 2&#x27;s target score is first calculated once Team 1&#x27;s innings has finished.
*If there were interruption(s) during Team 1&#x27;s innings, or Team 1&#x27;s innings was cut short, so the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will adjust Team 2&#x27;s target score as described above. The adjustment to Team 2&#x27;s target after interruptions in Team 1&#x27;s innings is often an increase, implying that Team 2 has more resource available than Team 1 had. Although both teams have 10 wickets and the same (reduced) number of overs available, an increase is fair as, for some of their innings, Team 1 &quot;thought&quot; they would have more overs available than they actually ended up having. If Team 1 had known that their innings was going to be shorter, they would have batted less conservatively, and scored more runs (at the expense of more wickets). They saved some wicket resource to use up in the overs that ended up being cancelled, which Team 2 does not need to do, therefore Team 2 &quot;does&quot; have more resource to use in the same number of overs. Therefore, increasing Team 2&#x27;s target score compensates Team 1 for the denial of some of the overs they thought they would get to bat. The increased target is what D/L thinks Team 1 would have scored in the overs it ended up having, if it had known throughout that the innings would be only as long as it was.
:For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, thinking they would have 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it would clearly be unfair to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.
*If there are interruption(s) to Team 2&#x27;s innings, either before it starts, during, or it is cut short, then D/L will reduce Team 2&#x27;s target score from the initial target set at the end of Team 1&#x27;s innings, in proportion to the reduction in Team 2&#x27;s resources. If there are multiple interruptions in the second innings, the target will be adjusted downwards each time.
*If there are interruptions which both increase and decrease the target score, then the net effect on the target could be either an increase or decrease, depending on which interruptions were .

===Mathematical theory===
The original D/L model started by assuming that the number of runs that can still be scored (called formula_3), for a given number of overs remaining (called formula_4) and wickets lost (called formula_5), takes the following exponential decay relationship:

:formula_6

where the constant formula_7 is the asymptotic average total score in unlimited overs (under one-day rules), and formula_8 is the exponential decay constant. Both vary with formula_5 (only). The values of these two parameters for each formula_5 from 0 to 9 were estimated from scores from &#x27;hundreds of one-day internationals&#x27; and &#x27;extensive research and experimentation&#x27;, though were not disclosed due to &#x27;commercial confidentiality&#x27;.
Finding the value of formula_3 for a particular combination of formula_4 and formula_5 (by putting in formula_4 and the values of these constants for the particular formula_5), and dividing this by the score achievable at the start of the innings, i.e. finding
:formula_16
gives the proportion of the combined run scoring resources of the innings remaining when formula_4 overs are left and formula_5 wickets are down. These proportions can be plotted in a graph, as shown right, or shown in a single table, as shown below.

This became the Standard Edition. When it was introduced, it was necessary that D/L could be implemented with a single table of
resource percentages, as it could not be guaranteed that computers would be present. Therefore, this single formula was used giving average resources. This method relies on the assumption that average performance is proportional to the mean, irrespective of the actual score. This was good enough in 95 per cent of matches, but in the 5 per cent of matches with very high scores, the simple approach started to break down. To overcome the problem, an upgraded formula was proposed with an additional parameter whose value depends on the Team 1 innings. This became the Professional Edition.

==Examples==
===Stoppage in first innings===
====Increased target====
In the 4th India‚ÄìEngland ODI in the 2008 series, the first innings was interrupted by rain on two occasions, reducing the match to 22 overs each. India (batting first) made 166/4. The D/L method increased England&#x27;s target to 198 from 22 overs. As England &quot;knew&quot; they had only 22 overs, the expectation is that they could score more runs from those overs than India had from their (interrupted) innings. England made 178/8 from 22 overs, and so the match was listed as &quot;India won by 19 runs (D/L method)&quot;.

During the 5th ODI between India and South Africa in January 2011, rain halted play twice during the first innings. The match was reduced to 46 overs each. South Africa scored 250/9. The D/L method increased India&#x27;s target to 268. As the number of overs was reduced during South Africa&#x27;s innings, this method takes into account what South Africa were likely to have scored if they had known throughout their innings that it would only be 46 overs long. The match was listed as &quot;South Africa won by 33 runs (D/L method)&quot;.

====Decreased target====
On 3 December 2014, Sri Lanka played England and batted first, but play was interrupted when Sri Lanka had scored 6/1 from 2 overs. At the restart, both innings were reduced to 35 overs, and Sri Lanka finished on 242/8. D/L reduced England&#x27;s target to 236 from 35 overs. Although Sri Lanka had less resource remaining after the interruption than England would have for their whole innings (about 7% less), they had used up 8% of their resource (2 overs and 1 wicket) before the interruption, so the total resource used by Sri Lanka was still slightly more than England had available, hence the slightly decreased target for England.

===Stoppage in second innings===
A simple example of the D/L method being applied was the 1st ODI between India and Pakistan in their 2006 ODI series. India batted first, and were all out for 328. Pakistan, batting second, were 311/7 when bad light stopped play after the 47th over. Pakistan&#x27;s target, had the match continued, was 18 runs in 18 balls, with three wickets in hand. Considering the overall scoring rate throughout the match, this is a target most teams would be favoured to achieve. And indeed, application of the D/L method resulted in a retrospective target score of 305 (or par score of 304) at the end of the 47th over, with the result therefore officially listed as &quot;Pakistan won by 7 runs (D/L Method)&quot;.

The D/L method was used in the group stage match between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe at the T20 World Cup in 2010. Sri Lanka scored 173/7 in 20 overs batting first, and in reply Zimbabwe were 4/0 from 1 over when rain interrupted play. At the restart Zimbabwe&#x27;s target was reduced to 108 from 12 overs, but rain stopped the match when they had scored 29/1 from 5 overs. The retrospective D/L target from 5 overs was a further reduction to 44, or a par score of 43, and hence Sri Lanka won the match by 14 runs.

The DLS method was also used after the rain disruption in the 2023 Indian Premier League final, when Chennai Super Kings had scored 4/0 (0.3 overs) and the Gujarat Titans just scored 214/4 (20 overs). The target was reduced at 171 runs from 15 overs from earlier target of 215 runs from 20 overs for Chennai Super Kings. Chennai Super Kings won by 5 wickets by the DLS method. This was achieved by reaching 171/5 from 15 overs. 

An example of a D/L tied match was the ODI between England and India on 11 September 2011. This match was frequently interrupted by rain in the final overs, and a ball-by-ball calculation of the Duckworth‚ÄìLewis &#x27;par&#x27; score played a key role in tactical decisions during those overs. At one point, India were leading under D/L during one rain delay, and would have won if play had not resumed. At a second rain interval, England, who had scored some quick runs (knowing they needed to get ahead in D/L terms) would correspondingly have won if play had not resumed. Play was finally called off with just 7 balls of the match remaining and England&#x27;s score equal to the Duckworth‚ÄìLewis &#x27;par&#x27; score, therefore resulting in a tie.

This example does show how crucial (and difficult) the decisions of the umpires can be, in assessing when rain is heavy enough to justify ceasing play. If the umpires of that match had halted play one ball earlier, England would have been ahead on D/L, and so would have won the match. Equally, if play had stopped one ball later, India could have won the match with a dot ball ‚Äì indicating how finely-tuned D/L calculations can be in such situations.

===Stoppages in both innings===
During the 2012/13 KFC Big Bash League, D/L was used in the 2nd semi-final played between the Melbourne Stars and the Perth Scorchers. After rain delayed the start of the match, it interrupted Melbourne&#x27;s innings when they had scored 159/1 off 15.2 overs, and both innings were reduced by 2 overs to 18, and Melbourne finished on 183/2. After a further rain delay reduced Perth&#x27;s innings to 17 overs, Perth returned to the field to face 13 overs, with a revised target of 139. Perth won the game by 8 wickets with a boundary off the final ball.

===Stoppage in second innings with revised target already achieved===
When a team who get their full resources scores very low, and their opponents score very quickly early in their innings a stoppage can result in a revised target that has already been achieved. In 2012 a Big Bash League Twenty20 over match between Perth &amp; Melbourne Stars saw Perth score a record low of 69 runs all out. Melbourne Stars scored 29 from their first 2 overs when rain fell and delayed the match. Once the rain cleared the umpires decided that the match conditions and timing was acceptable for a reduced 5 over innings from Melbourne. Under the older Duckworth-Lewis method the revised target score for their 5 over innings was only 20 runs, a score which Melbourne had already exceeded. The unusual situation saw the match referee order the two teams to play out a single delivery (a non-scoring leave through to the keeper) then &quot;award&quot; the match to Melbourne in an effort to avoid confusing spectators and television viewers. This &quot;extra ball&quot; was later declared void as it was not required and was expunged from the match score along with the impact the ball had on the league table net run rate. Melbourne won by 24 runs under the D/L method calculated using the par score of 6 runs after 2 overs. The 6 run par score incorrectly reported by some media outlets to have been the target.

As any competitive match will have a minimum over requirement, commonly 5 overs each in Twenty20 cricket and 20 or 25 each in one day internationals, a team being ahead of a revised target for the amount of play remaining can leave the teams waiting for the weather to clear, the ground staff to work and the match referee to decide the game could continue even though no more play would occur in order to determine if the match is abandoned or a declared victory for the batting team.

==Use and updates==
The published table that underpins the D/L method is regularly updated, using source data from more recent matches; this is done on 1 July annually.

For 50-over matches decided by D/L, each team must face at least 20 overs for the result to be valid, and for Twenty20 games decided by D/L, each side must face at least five overs, unless one or both teams are bowled out and/or the second team reaches its target in fewer overs. 

If the conditions prevent a match from reaching this minimum length, it is declared a no result.

===1996‚Äì2003 ‚Äì Single version===
Until 2003, a single version of D/L was in use. This used a single published reference table of total resource percentages remaining for all possible combinations of overs and wickets, and some simple mathematical calculations, and was relatively transparent and straightforward to implement.

However, a flaw in how it handled very high first innings scores (350+) became apparent from the 1999 Cricket World Cup match in Bristol between India and Kenya. Tony Lewis noticed that there was an inherent weakness in the formula that would give a noticeable advantage to the side chasing a total in excess of 350. A correction was built into the formula and the software, but was not fully adopted until 2004. One-day matches were achieving significantly higher scores than in previous decades, affecting the historical relationship between resources and runs. The second version uses more sophisticated statistical modelling, but does not use a single table of resource percentages. Instead, the percentages also vary with score, so a computer is required. Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity.

In 2002 the resource percentages were revised, following an extensive analysis of limited overs matches, and there was a change to the G50 for ODIs. (G50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match.) G50 was changed to 235 for ODIs. These changes came into effect on 1 September 2002. As of 2014, these resource percentages are the ones still in use in the Standard Edition, though G50 has subsequently changed.

The tables show how the percentages were in 1999 and 2001, and what they were changed to in 2002. Mostly they were reduced.

===2004 ‚Äì Adoption of second version===
The original version was named the Standard Edition, and the new version was named the Professional Edition. Tony Lewis said, &quot;We were then [at the time of the 2003 World Cup Final] using what is now known as the Standard Edition. ... Australia got 359 and that showed up the flaws and straight away the next edition was introduced which handled high scores much better. The par score for India is likely to be much higher now.&quot;

Duckworth and Lewis wrote, &quot;When the side batting first score at or below the average for top level cricket¬†..., the results of applying the Professional Edition are generally similar to those from the Standard Edition. For higher scoring matches, the results start to diverge and the difference increases the higher the first innings total. In effect there is now a different table of resource percentages for every total score in the Team 1 innings.&quot; The Professional Edition has been in use in all international one-day cricket matches since early 2004. This edition also removed the use of the G50 constant when dealing with interruptions in the first innings.

The decision on which edition should be used is for the cricket authority which runs the particular competition. The ICC Playing Handbook requires the use of the Professional Edition for internationals. This also applies to most countries&#x27; national competitions. At lower levels of the game, where use of a computer cannot always be guaranteed, the Standard Edition is used.

===2009 - Twenty20 updates===
In June 2009, it was reported that the D/L method would be reviewed for the Twenty20 format after its appropriateness was questioned in the quickest version of the game. Lewis was quoted admitting that &quot;Certainly, people have suggested that we need to look very carefully and see whether in fact the numbers in our formula are totally appropriate for the Twenty20 game.&quot;

===2015 ‚Äì Becomes DLS===
For the 2015 World Cup, the ICC implemented the Duckworth‚ÄìLewis‚ÄìStern formula, which included work by the new custodian of the method, Professor Steven Stern, from the Department of Statistics at Queensland University of Technology. These changes recognised that teams need to start out with a higher scoring rate when chasing high targets rather than keep wickets in hand.

==Target score calculations==
Using the notation of the ICC Playing Handbook, the team that bats first is called Team 1, their final score is called S, the total resources available to Team 1 for their innings is called R1, the team that bats second is called Team 2, and the total resources available to Team 2 for their innings is called R2.

===Step 1. Find the batting resources available to each team===

After each reduction in overs, the new total batting resources available to the two teams are found, using figures for the total amount of batting resources &quot;remaining&quot; for any combination of overs and wickets. While the process for converting these resources remaining figures into total resource available figures is the same in the two Editions, this can be done manually in the Standard Edition, as the resource remaining figures are published in a reference table. However, the resource remaining figures used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available, so a computer must be used which has the software loaded.

*If a team loses resource at the &quot;start&quot; of an innings (left hand image below), then this is simple. For example, if the first 20 overs of an innings are lost, then 30 overs and 10 wickets are remaining, which is 75.1% in the Standard Edition, so this is the resource available.
*If a team loses resource at the &quot;end&quot; of its innings (centre image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and subtracting the resources remaining at the point the innings was ended. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but its innings is ended with 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% ‚àí 52.4% = 47.6%.
*If a team loses resource in the &quot;middle&quot; of its innings (right hand image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and subtracting the resources remaining at the point the innings was interrupted (to give the resources used in the first period of the innings), then adding on the resource remaining at the restart. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but is interrupted when it still has 40 overs and 8 wickets remaining (77.8% of its resources), and restarted when it has 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% ‚àí 77.8% + 52.4% = 74.6%. Another way of looking at this is to say it lost the resources available between 40 overs and 8 wickets (77.8%) and 20 overs and 8 wickets (52.4%), i.e. 77.8% ‚àí 52.4% = 25.4%, so its total resource available was 100% ‚àí 25.4% = 74.6%.
 
These are just the different ways of having one interruption. With multiple interruptions possible, it may seem like finding the total resource percentage requires a different calculation for each different scenario. However, the formula is actually the same each time ‚àí it&#x27;s just that different scenarios, with more or less interruptions and restarts, need to use more or less of the same formula. The total resources available to a team are given by:


which can alternatively be written as:


Each time there&#x27;s an interruption or a restart after an interruption, the resource remaining percentages at those times (obtained from a reference table for the Standard Edition, or from a computer for the Professional Edition) can be entered into the formula, with the rest left blank. Note that a delay at the start of an innings counts as the 1st interruption.

===Step 2. Convert the two teams&#x27; batting resources into Team 2&#x27;s target score===

Standard Edition

*If R2¬†&lt;¬†R1, reduce Team 2&#x27;s target score in proportion to the reduction in total resources, i.e. S¬†√ó¬†R2/R1.
*If R2¬†=¬†R1, no adjustment to Team 2&#x27;s target score is needed.
*If R2¬†&gt;¬†R1, increase Team 2&#x27;s target score by the extra runs that could be expected to be scored on average with the extra total resource, i.e. S¬†+¬†G50¬†√ó¬†(R2¬†‚Äì¬†R1)/100, where G50 is the average 50-over total. Team 2&#x27;s target score is not simply increased in proportion to the increase in total resources, i.e. S¬†√ó¬†R2/R1, as this &#x27;could lead to some unrealistically high targets if Team 1 had achieved an early high rate of scoring [in the powerplay overs] and rain caused a drastic reduction in the overs for the match.&#x27; Instead, D/L Standard Edition requires average performance for Team 2&#x27;s additional resource over Team 1.

G50

G50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match. This will vary with the level of competition and over time. The annual ICC Playing Handbook gives the values of G50 to be used each year when the D/L Standard Edition is applied:

Duckworth and Lewis wrote:

Professional Edition

*If R2¬†&lt;¬†R1, reduce Team 2&#x27;s target score in proportion to the reduction in total resources, i.e. S¬†√ó¬†R2/R1.
*If R2¬†=¬†R1, no adjustment to Team 2&#x27;s target score is needed.
*If R2¬†&gt;¬†R1, increase Team 2&#x27;s target score in proportion to the increase in total resources, i.e. S¬†√ó¬†R2/R1. The problem of early high scoring rates potentially producing anomalously high targets has been overcome in the Professional Edition, which is essentially &#x27;a different table of resource percentages for every total score in the Team 1 innings.&#x27; Therefore, Team 2&#x27;s target score can be simply increased in proportion to the increase in total resources when R2¬†&gt;¬†R1, and there is no G50.

===Example Standard Edition Target score calculations===
As the resource percentages used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available, it is difficult to give examples of the D/L calculation for the Professional Edition. Therefore, examples are given from when the Standard Edition was widely used, which was up to early 2004.

====Reduced target: Team 1&#x27;s innings completed; Team 2&#x27;s innings delayed (resources lost at start of innings)====

On 18 May 2003, Lancashire played Hampshire in the 2003 ECB National League. Rain before play reduced the match to 30 overs each. Lancashire batted first and scored 231‚Äì4 from their 30 overs. Before Hampshire began their innings, it was further reduced to 28 overs.

Hampshire&#x27;s target was therefore 221 to win (in 28 overs), or 220 to tie. They were all out for 150, giving Lancashire victory by 220 ‚àí 150 = 70 runs.

If Hampshire&#x27;s target had been set by the Average Run Rate method (simply in proportion to the reduction in overs), their par score would have been 231 x 28/30 = 215.6, giving 216 to win or 215 to tie. While this would have kept the required run rate the same as Lancashire achieved (7.7 runs per over), this would have given an unfair advantage to Hampshire as it&#x27;s easier to achieve and maintain a run rate for a shorter period. Increasing Hampshire&#x27;s target from 216 overcomes this flaw.

As Lancashire&#x27;s innings was interrupted once (before it started), and then restarted, their resource can be found from the general formula above as follows (Hampshire&#x27;s is similar): Total resources = 100% ‚àí Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart = 100% ‚àí 100% + 75.1% = 75.1%.

====Reduced target: Team 1&#x27;s innings completed; Team 2&#x27;s innings cut short (resources lost at end of innings)====

On 3 March 2003, Sri Lanka played South Africa in World Cup Pool B. Sri Lanka batted first and scored 268‚Äì9 from their 50 overs. Chasing a target of 269, South Africa had reached 229‚Äì6 from 45 overs when play was abandoned.

Therefore, South Africa&#x27;s retrospective target from their 45 overs was 230 runs to win, or 229 to tie. In the event, as they had scored exactly 229, the match was declared a tie.

South Africa scored no runs off the very last ball. If play had been abandoned without that ball having been bowled, the resource available to South Africa at the abandonment would have been 14.7%, giving them a par score of 228.6, and hence victory.

As South Africa&#x27;s innings was interrupted once (and not restarted), their resource is given by the general formula above as follows: Total resources available = 100% ‚àí Resources remaining at 1st interruption = 100% ‚àí 14.3% = 85.7%.

====Reduced target: Team 1&#x27;s innings completed; Team 2&#x27;s innings interrupted (resources lost in middle of innings)====
On 16 February 2003, New South Wales played South Australia in the ING Cup. New South Wales batted first and scored 273 all out (from 49.4 overs). Chasing a target of 274, rain interrupted play when South Australia had reached 70‚Äì2 from 19 overs, and at the restart their innings was reduced to 36 overs (i.e. 17 remaining).

South Australia&#x27;s new target was therefore 214 to win (in 36 overs), or 213 to tie. In the event, they were all out for 174, so New South Wales won by 213 ‚àí 174 = 39 runs.

As South Australia&#x27;s innings was interrupted once and restarted once, their resource is given by the general formula above as follows: Total resources available = 100% ‚àí Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart = 100% ‚àí 68.6% + 46.7% = 78.1%.

====Increased target: Team 1&#x27;s innings cut short (resources lost at end of innings); Team 2&#x27;s innings completed====
On 25 January 2001, West Indies played Zimbabwe. West Indies batted first and had reached 235‚Äì6 from 47 overs (of a scheduled 50) when rain halted play for two hours. At the restart, both innings were reduced to 47 overs, i.e. West Indies&#x27; innings was closed immediately, and Zimbabwe began their innings.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s target was therefore 253 to win (in 47 overs), or 252 to tie. It is fair that their target was increased, even though they had the same number of overs to bat as West Indies, as West Indies would have batted more aggressively in their last few overs, and scored more runs, if they had known that their innings would be cut short at 47 overs. Zimbabwe were all out for 175, giving West Indies victory by 252¬†‚àí¬†175 =¬†77¬†runs.

These resource percentages are the ones which were in use back in 2001, before the 2002 revision, and so do not match the currently used percentages for the Standard Edition, which are slightly different. Also, the formula for Zimbabwe&#x27;s par score comes from the Standard Edition of D/L, which was used at the time. Currently the Professional Edition is used, which has a different formula when R2&gt;R1. The formula required Zimbabwe to match West Indies&#x27; performance with their overlapping 89.8% of resource (i.e. score 235 runs), and achieve average performance with their extra 97.4% ‚àí 89.8% = 7.6% of resource (i.e. score 7.6% of G50 (225 at the time) = 17.1 runs).

As West Indies&#x27; innings was interrupted once (and not restarted), their resource is given by the general formula above as follows: Total resources available = 100% ‚àí Resources remaining at 1st interruption = 100% ‚àí 10.2% = 89.8%.

====Increased target: Multiple interruptions in Team 1&#x27;s innings (resources lost in middle of innings); Team 2&#x27;s innings completed====
On 20 February 2003, Australia played Netherlands in the 2003 Cricket World Cup Pool A. Rain before play reduced the match to 47 overs each, and Australia batted first. 
*Rain stopped play when they had reached 109‚Äì2 from 25 overs (i.e. 22 remaining). At the restart both innings were reduced to 44 overs (i.e. 19 remaining for Australia)
*Rain stopped play again when Australia had reached 123‚Äì2 from 28 overs (i.e. 16 remaining), and at the restart both innings were reduced further to 36 overs (i.e. 8 remaining for Australia)
*Australia finished on 170‚Äì2 from their 36 overs

The Netherlands&#x27; target was therefore 198 to win (in 36 overs), or 197 to tie. It is fair that their target was increased, even though they had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands&#x27; target score neutralises the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 ‚àí 122 = 75 runs.

This formula for Netherlands&#x27; par score comes from the Standard Edition of D/L, which was used at the time. Currently the Professional Edition is used, which has a different formula when R2&gt;R1. The formula required Netherlands to match Australia&#x27;s performance with their overlapping 72.6% of resource (i.e. score 170 runs), and achieve average performance with their extra 84.1% ‚àí 72.6% = 11.5% of resource (i.e. score 11.5% of G50 (235 at the time) = 27.025 runs).

After the match there were reports in the media that Australia had batted conservatively in their final 8 overs after the final restart, to avoid losing wickets rather than maximising their numbers of runs, in belief that this would further increase the Netherlands&#x27; par score. However, if this is true, this belief was mistaken, in the same way that conserving wickets rather than maximising runs in the final 8 overs of a full 50-over innings would be a mistake. At that point the amount of resource available to each team was fixed (as long as there were no further rain interruptions), so the only undetermined number in the formula for Netherlands&#x27; par score was Australia&#x27;s final score, so they should have tried to maximise this.

As Australia&#x27;s innings was interrupted three times (once before it started) and restarted three times, their resource is given by the general formula above as follows:

Total resources available = 100% ‚àí Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart ‚àí Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart ‚àí Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart = 100% ‚àí 100% + 97.1% ‚àí 55.8% + 50.5% ‚àí 44.7% + 25.5% = 72.6%.

==In-game strategy==
===During team 1&#x27;s innings===
====Strategy for team 1====
During Team 1&#x27;s innings, the target score calculations (as described above), have not yet been made.

The objective of the team batting first is to maximise the target score which will be calculated for the team batting second, which (in the Professional Edition) will be determined by the formula:

formula_1

For these three terms:
*Team 1&#x27;s score: Team 1 will always increase Team 2&#x27;s target by increasing their own score. 
*At the start of Team 2&#x27;s innings, Team 2&#x27;s resources will be 10 wickets and the number of overs available, and Team 1 cannot affect this.
*Team 1&#x27;s resources are given by:


If there will not be any future interruptions to Team 1&#x27;s innings, then the amount of resource available to them is now fixed (whether there have been interruptions so far or not), so the only thing Team 1 can do to increase Team 2&#x27;s target is increase their own score, ignoring how many wickets they lose (as in a normal unaffected match).

However, if there will be future interruptions to Team 1&#x27;s innings, then an alternative strategy to scoring more runs is minimising the amount of resource they use before the coming interruption (i.e. preserving wickets). While the best overall strategy is obviously to both score more runs &quot;and&quot; preserve resources, if a choice has to be made between the two, sometimes preserving wickets at the expense of scoring runs (&#x27;conservative&#x27; batting) is a more effective way of increasing Team 2&#x27;s target, and sometimes the reverse (&#x27;aggressive&#x27; batting) is true.

For example, suppose Team 1 has been batting without interruptions, but thinks the innings will be cut short at 40 overs, i.e. with 10 overs left. (Then Team 2 will have 40 overs to bat, so Team 2&#x27;s resource will be 89.3%.) Team 1 thinks by batting conservatively it can reach 200‚Äì6, or by batting aggressively it can reach 220‚Äì8:

Therefore, in this case, the conservative strategy achieves a higher target for Team 2.

However, suppose instead that the difference between the two strategies is scoring 200‚Äì2 or 220‚Äì4:

In this case, the aggressive strategy is better.

Therefore, the best batting strategy for Team 1 ahead of a coming interruption is not always the same, but varies with the facts of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the opinions about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last ‚Äì will Team 1&#x27;s innings be restarted?).

This example shows just two possible batting strategies, but in reality there could be a range of others, e.g. &#x27;neutral&#x27;, &#x27;semi-aggressive&#x27;, &#x27;super-aggressive&#x27;, or timewasting to minimise the amount of resource used by slowing the over rate. Finding which strategy is the best can only be found by inputting the facts and one&#x27;s opinions into the calculations and seeing what emerges.

Of course, a chosen strategy may backfire. For example, if Team 1 chooses to bat conservatively, Team 2 may see this and decide to attack (rather than focus on saving runs), and Team 1 may both fail to score many more runs &quot;and&quot; lose wickets.

If there have already been interruptions to Team 1&#x27;s innings, the calculation of total resource they use will be more complicated than this example.

====Strategy for team 2====
During Team 1&#x27;s innings, Team 2&#x27;s objective is to minimise the target score they will be set. This is achieved by minimising Team 1&#x27;s score, or (as above), if there will be future interruptions to Team 1&#x27;s innings, alternatively by maximising the resource used by Team 1 (i.e. wickets lost or overs bowled) before that happens. Team 2 can vary their bowling strategy (between conservative and aggressive) to try to achieve either of these objectives, so this means doing the same calculations as above, inputting their opinions of future runs conceded, wickets taken and overs bowled in each bowling strategy, to see which one is best.

Also, Team 2 can encourage Team 1 to bat particularly conservatively or aggressively (e.g. through field settings).

===During team 2&#x27;s innings===
A target (from a given number of overs) is set for Team 2 at the start of its innings. If there will not be any future interruptions, then both sides can play to a finish in the normal way. However, if there are likely to be interruptions to Team 2&#x27;s innings, then Team 2 will aim to keep itself ahead of the D/L par score, and Team 1 will aim to keep them behind it. This is because, if a match is abandoned before the given number of overs is complete, Team 2 is declared the winner if they&#x27;re ahead of the par score, and Team 1 is declared the winner if Team 2 are behind the par score. A tie is declared if Team 2 are exactly on the par score. (This is provided a minimum number of overs has been bowled in Team 2&#x27;s innings.)

The par score increases with every ball bowled and every wicket lost, as the amount of resource used increases. As an example, in the 2003 Cricket World Cup Final Australia batted first and scored 359 from 50 overs. As Australia completed their 50 overs, their total resources used R1=100%, so India&#x27;s par score throughout their innings was: 359 x R2/100%, where R2 is the amount of resource used to that point. As shown in the first line of the table below, after 9 overs India were 57-1, and 41 overs and 9 wickets remaining equates to 85.3% of resources, so 100% ‚àí 85.3% = 14.7% had been used. India&#x27;s par score after 9 overs was therefore 359 x 14.7%/100% = 52.773, which is rounded down to 52.

During the six balls of the 10th over India scored 0, 0, 0, 1 (from a no ball), loss of wicket, 0. At the start of the over India were ahead of the par score, but the loss of the wicket caused their par score to jump from 55 to 79, which put them behind the par score.

==Other uses==

There are uses of the D/L method other than finding the current official final target score for the team batting second in a match that has already been reduced by the weather.

===Ball-by-ball par score===

During the second team&#x27;s innings, the number of runs a chasing side would expect to have scored on average with this number of overs used and wickets lost, if they were going to successfully match the first team&#x27;s score, called the D/L par score, may be shown on a computer printout, the scoreboard and/or TV alongside the actual score, and updated after every ball. This can happen in matches which look like they&#x27;re about to be shortened by the weather, and so D/L is about to be brought into play, or even in matches completely unaffected by the weather. This is:

*To help spectators and players understand whether the chasing side are doing better or worse than they would need to do on average to reach the target score
*The score the batting team&#x27;s score would be compared to determine which side had won, if the match had to be abandoned right then. It is the par score which is displayed, i.e. the score to tie. The target, to win, score is one run more than this. South Africa exited the 2003 World Cup after a tie with Sri Lanka by mistakenly believing the par score on the printout was the target score

===Net run rate calculation===
It has been suggested that when a side batting second successfully completes the run chase, the D/L method could be used to predict how many runs they would have scored with a full innings (i.e. 50 overs in a One Day International), and use this prediction in the net run rate calculation.

This suggestion is in response to the criticisms of NRR that it does not take into account wickets lost, and that it unfairly penalises teams which bat second and win, as those innings are shorter and therefore have less weight in the NRR calculation than other innings which go the full distance.

==Criticism==
The D/L method has been criticised on the grounds that wickets are a much more heavily weighted resource than overs, leading to the suggestion that if teams are chasing large targets and there is the prospect of rain, a winning strategy could be to not lose wickets and score at what would seem to be a &quot;losing&quot; rate (e.g. if the required rate was 6.1, it could be enough to score at 4.75 an over for the first 20‚Äì25 overs). The 2015 update to DLS recognised this flaw, and changed the rate at which teams needed to score at the start of the second innings in response to a large first innings.

Another criticism is that the D/L method does not account for changes in proportion of the innings for which field restrictions are in place compared to a completed match.

More recent efforts have used ball-by-ball ODI databases of actually completed matches to evaluate the accuracy of the method. Those efforts have concluded that the DLS par score can have accuracies as low as 50 to 60% at predicting the eventual winner of the match when the team batting second bats between 20 and 24 overs and loses between 0 and 2 wickets.

More common informal criticism from cricket fans and journalists of the D/L method is that it is unduly complex and can be misunderstood. For example, in a one-day match against England on 20 March 2009, the West Indies coach (John Dyson) called his players in for bad light, believing that his team would win by one run under the D/L method, but not realising that the loss of a wicket with the last ball had altered the Duckworth‚ÄìLewis score. In fact Javagal Srinath, the match referee, confirmed that the West Indies were two runs short of their target, giving the victory to England.

Concerns have also been raised as to its suitability for Twenty20 matches, where a high scoring over can drastically alter the situation of the game, and variability of the run-rate is higher over matches with a shorter number of overs.

==Cultural influence==
&quot;The Duckworth Lewis Method&quot; is the name of a pop group, formed by Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy and Thomas Walsh of Pugwash. Their first release was an eponymous album, which features cricket-themed songs.

<doc id="683628" wikidata="Q424460" url="?curid=683628" title="Accelerator effect">
<text>The accelerator effect in economics is a positive effect on private fixed investment of the growth of the market economy (measured e.g. by a change in gross domestic product (GDP)). Rising GDP (an economic boom or prosperity) implies that businesses in general see rising profits, increased sales and cash flow, and greater use of existing capacity. This usually implies that profit expectations and business confidence rise, encouraging businesses to build more factories and other buildings and to install more machinery. (This expenditure is called &quot;fixed investment&quot;.) This may lead to further growth of the economy through the stimulation of consumer incomes and purchases, i.e., via the multiplier effect.

In essence, the accelerator effect proposes that investment levels are contingent on the pace of change in GDP rather than its absolute level. In simpler terms, it is the acceleration or deceleration of economic growth that shapes businesses&#x27; choices regarding investments.

The accelerator effect operates in reverse as well: when the GDP declines (entering a recession), it negatively impacts business profits, sales, cash flow, capacity utilization, and expectations. Consequently, these factors discourage businesses from making fixed investments, which further intensifies the recession due to the multiplier effect.

The accelerator effect fits the behavior of an economy best when either the economy is moving away from full employment or when it is already below that level of production. This is because high levels of aggregate demand hit against the limits set by the existing labour force, the existing stock of capital goods, the availability of natural resources, and the technical ability of an economy to convert inputs into products.

==History==
The accelerator theory concept was mainly given by Thomas Nixon Carver and Albert Aftalion before Keynesian economics came into force, but it came into public knowledge more and more as Keynesian theory began to dominate the field of economics. John Maynard Keynes first introduced the idea in his seminal work &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,&quot; published in 1936. Keynes recognized that changes in investment are not solely driven by interest rates but are also influenced by the level of demand for goods and services.

In the 1940s, American economist Alvin Hansen further developed the accelerator principle. He extended Keynes&#x27;s ideas and introduced the concept of the &quot;principle of acceleration.&quot; Hansen emphasized the role of the accelerator effect in business cycles, showing that fluctuations in investment are a significant driver of economic fluctuations. He proposed that investment decisions are not just influenced by current income or demand levels but are also sensitive to changes in the rate of income growth.

Over time, economists have further refined and expanded upon the accelerator effect in various ways. Some have incorporated additional factors such as technological change, expectations, and financial constraints to enhance the accuracy of investment predictions. However, the accelerator effect has also faced criticism. Some people argued against it because it was thought to remove all the possibility of the demand control through the price control mechanism.

==Multiplier effect vs. acceleration effect==

The acceleration effect is the phenomenon that a variable moves toward its desired value faster and faster with respect to time. Usually, the variable is the capital stock. In Keynesian models, fixed capital is not in consideration, so the accelerator coefficient becomes the reciprocal of the multiplier and the capital decision degenerates to investment decision. In more general theory, where the capital decision determines the desired level of capital stock (which includes fixed capital and working capital), and the investment decision determines the change of capital stock in a sequences of periods, the acceleration effect emerges as only the current period gap affects the current investment, so do the previous gaps. The Aftalion-Clark accelerator v has such a form
formula_1, while the Keynesian multiplier m has such a form
formula_2 where &quot;MPC&quot; is the marginal propensity to consume. The idea of the accelerator has been very well explained by Hayek.

==Business cycles vs. acceleration effect==
As the acceleration effect dictates that the increase of income accelerates capital accumulation, and the decrease of income accelerates capital depletion (in a simple model), this might cause the system to become unstable or cyclical, and hence many kinds of business cycle models are of this kind (the multiplier-accelerator cycle models).

==Accelerator models==

The accelerator effect is shown in the simple accelerator model. This model assumes that the stock of capital goods (K) is proportional to the level of production (&quot;Y&quot;):

: &quot;K&quot; = &quot;k&quot;√ó&quot;Y&quot;

This implies that if &quot;k&quot; (the capital-output ratio) is constant, an increase in &quot;Y&quot; requires an increase in &quot;K&quot;. That is, net investment, &quot;In&quot; equals:

: &quot;In&quot; = &quot;k&quot;√óŒî&quot;Y&quot;

Suppose that &quot;k&quot; = 2 (usually, k is assumed to be in (0,1)). This equation implies that if &quot;Y&quot; rises by 10, then net investment will equal 10√ó2 = 20, as suggested by the accelerator effect. If &quot;Y&quot; then rises by only 5, the equation implies that the level of investment will be 5√ó2 = 10. This means that the simple accelerator model implies that fixed investment will &quot;fall&quot; if the growth of production &quot;slows&quot;. &quot;An actual fall in production is not needed to cause investment to fall.&quot; However, such a fall in output will result if slowing growth of production causes investment to fall, since that reduces aggregate demand. Thus, the simple accelerator model implies an endogenous explanation of the business-cycle downturn, the transition to a recession.

Modern economists have described the accelerator effect in terms of the more sophisticated flexible accelerator model of investment. Businesses are described as engaging in net investment in fixed capital goods in order to close the gap between the &quot;desired&quot; stock of capital goods (&quot;K&quot;d) and the &quot;existing&quot; stock of capital goods left over from the past (&quot;K&quot;‚àí1):

:formula_3

where &quot;x&quot; is a coefficient representing the speed of adjustment (1 ‚â• &quot;x&quot; ‚â• 0).

:formula_1

The desired stock of capital goods is determined by such variables as the expected profit rate, the expected level of output, the interest rate (the cost of finance), and technology. Because the expected level of output plays a role, this model exhibits behavior described by the accelerator effect but less extreme than that of the simple accelerator. Because the existing capital stock grows over time due to past net investment, a &quot;slowing&quot; of the growth of output (GDP) can cause the gap between the desired &quot;K&quot; and the existing &quot;K&quot; to narrow, close, or even become negative, causing current net investment to fall.

Obviously, ceteris paribus, an actual fall in output depresses the desired stock of capital goods and thus net investment. Similarly, a rise in output causes a rise in investment. Finally, if the desired capital stock is less than the actual stock, then net investment may be depressed for a long time.

In the neoclassical accelerator model of Jorgenson, the desired capital stock is derived from the aggregate production function assuming profit maximization and perfect competition. In Jorgenson&#x27;s original model (1963), there is no acceleration effect, since the investment is instantaneous, so the capital stock can jump.

<text>The kallikantzaros (; ; ; ; ; or kallikantzaroi in plural) is a malevolent creature in Southeast European and Anatolian folklore. Stories about the &quot;kallikantzaros&quot; or its equivalents can typically be found in Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Serbia, Albania, Bosnia, and Cyprus. &quot;Kallikantzaroi&quot; are believed to dwell underground but come to the surface during the twelve days of Christmas, from 25 December to 6 January (from the winter solstice for a fortnight, during which time the sun ceases its seasonal movement).

==Etymology==
The term &quot;kallikantzaros&quot; is speculated to be derived from the Greek &quot;kalos-kentauros&quot; (&quot;beautiful centaur&quot;), although this theory has been met with many objections. A second theory proposes that the word comes from Turkish &quot;kara-kondjolos&quot; &quot;werewolf, vampire&quot;, from &quot;kara&quot; &quot;black&quot; and &quot;koncolos&quot; &quot;bloodsucker, werewolf&quot;.

==Greek folklore==
It is believed that &quot;kallikantzaroi&quot; stay underground, sawing the trunk of the tree that holds the Earth, so that it will collapse, along with the Earth. However, according to folklore, when the final part of the trunk is about to be sawed, Christmas dawns and &quot;kallikantzaroi&quot; are able to come to the surface. They forget the tree and come to bring trouble to mortals.

Finally, on the Epiphany (6 January), the sun starts moving again, and they must return underground to continue their sawing. They see that during their absence the world tree has healed itself, so they must start working all over again. This is believed to occur annually.

===Appearance===
There is no standard description of the appearance of &quot;kallikantzaroi&quot;; there are regional variations as to how their appearance is described. Some Greek illustrators have imagined them with some animal parts, such as hairy bodies, horse legs, or boar tusks. Sometimes they are enormous, at other times diminutive. Other groups see them as small humans with a horrible odor. They are predominantly male, often with protruding sexual characteristics. Many Greeks have imagined them as tall, black and hairy, with burning red eyes, goats&#x27; or donkeys&#x27; ears, monkeys&#x27; arms, tongues that hang out and heads that are huge. Nonetheless, the most common belief is that they are small, black creatures, humanoid apart from their long black tails, and said to resemble little black devils. They are also mostly blind, speak with a lisp and love to eat frogs, worms, and other small creatures.

===Lore===
&quot;Kallikantzaroi&quot; are believed to be creatures of the night. According to folklore, there were many ways people could protect themselves during the days when the &quot;kallikantzaroi&quot; were loose. One such method was to leave a colander on their doorstep to trick the visiting &quot;kallikantzaros&quot;. It was believed that since it could not count above two ‚Äì three was believed to be a holy number, and by pronouncing it, the &quot;kallikantzaros&quot; would supposedly kill itself ‚Äì the &quot;kallikantzaros&quot; would sit at the doorstep all night, counting each hole of the colander, until the sun rose and it was forced to hide.
It is an annual tradition in some cultures to throw ‚Äúloukoumades‚Äù (a donut-like dessert filled with syrup) and sausages on your roof, and sing a specific song. It is believed that once this is done, the &quot;kallikantzaroi&quot; will eat these and leave, returning to their work underground.

Another supposed method of protection from &quot;kallikantzaroi&quot; was to leave the fire burning in the fireplace, all night, so that they could not enter through it. In some areas, people would burn the Yule log for the duration of the twelve days. In other areas, people would throw foul-smelling shoes into the fire, as the stench was believed to repel the &quot;kallikantzaroi,&quot; forcing them to stay away. Additional ways to keep them away included marking one&#x27;s door with a black cross on Christmas Eve and burning incense.

According to legend, any child born during the twelve days of Christmas was in danger of transforming into a &quot;kallikantzaros&quot; during each Christmas season, starting with adulthood. It was believed that the antidote to prevent this transformation was to bind the baby in tresses of garlic or straw, or to singe the child&#x27;s toenails. According to another legend, anyone born on a Saturday could see and talk with the &quot;kallikantzaroi&quot;.

One particularity that set the &quot;kallikantzaroi&quot; apart from other goblins or creatures in folklore was that they were said to appear on Earth for only twelve days each year. Their short duration on Earth, as well as the fact that they were not considered purely malevolent creatures but rather impish and stupid, led to a number of theories about their creation. One such theory connects them to the masquerades of the ancient Roman winter festival of Bacchanalia, and earlier the Greek Dionysia. During the drunken, orgiastic parts of the festivals, people wearing masks, hidden under costumes in bestial shapes yet still appearing humanoid, may have made an exceptional impression on the minds of simple folk who were intoxicated.

In Greek, the term &quot;kallikantzaros&quot; is also used to describe a number of other short, ugly and usually mischievous beings in folklore. When not used for the aforementioned creatures, it seems to express the collective sense for the Irish word leprechaun and the English words gnome and goblin.

==Serbian folklore==
In Serbian Christmas traditions, the Twelve Days of Christmas were previously called the &quot;unbaptized days&quot; and were considered a time when demonic forces of all kinds were believed to be more active and dangerous than usual. People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the mythical demons called &quot;karakond≈æula&quot; (; also &quot;karakond≈æa /&quot; –∫–∞—Ä–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ü–∞, &quot;karakand≈æa /&quot; –∫–∞—Ä–∞–∫–∞–Ω—ü–∞ or &quot;karapand≈æa /&quot; –∫–∞—Ä–∞–ø–∞–Ω—ü–∞), imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. According to tradition, when a &quot;karakond≈æula&quot; found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on the person&#x27;s back and demand to be carried wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.

The karakond≈æula is also known to punish and torment people who commit adultery. Adulterers were known to sneak out of their homes while their significant other would sleep, and then visit the person they were cheating with, or prostitutes, or brothels. The karakond≈æula would sit and wait on the top of the doorframe of the front door to the house and jump on the back of the adulterers and lash them with a stick or scratch or dig its sharp nails in the person back and neck and force them to run through nearby forests all night. Similarity to other accounts the karakond≈æula would flee by the sight of first dawn.

This can be seen as a warning to would be adulterers to think carefully about their intentions, desires and understand the consequences that they would incur if they were to fulfill such actions. In this version of the myth the karakond≈æula would come back every night and remain on the door lintel until the adulterers confess their sins to their significant other.

==Bulgarian folklore==
The Bulgarian name of the demon is &quot;karakondjul&quot; (also romanized &quot;karakondjol&quot;, &quot;karakondzul/karakond≈æul&quot;; ) or &quot;karakondjo&quot; (). They may be conceived of variously: as being human-like except for having a hairy body, a tail, and a large head with horns on it, or a one-eyed being standing on a single leg, or a horse-headed man. It is considered a shape-shifter which may appear as a dog, a man, a sheep, or a calf. It is reputed to dwell in caves, or rivers, or abandoned water mill, and come out at night.

== Albanian folklore ==
In Albanian folklore Kukuth (kukudhi) and Karkanxholji (Karkan√ßoli, related to Greek Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ∫Œ¨ŒΩœÑœÉŒ±œÅŒøœÇ) are undead corpses, who go around in January, laden with chains and effusing a deadly breath. Known also among Calabrian Albanians. According to another version, the Karkan√ßual is vested with iron clothes, which is why chainmail armor is known as &quot;k√´mish karkan√ßoli&quot; in Albanian.

<text>St Olave&#x27;s Church, Hart Street, is a Church of England church in the City of London, located on the corner of Hart Street and Seething Lane near Fenchurch Street railway station.

John Betjeman described St Olave&#x27;s as &quot;a country church in the world of Seething Lane.&quot; The church is one of the smallest in the city and is one of only a handful of medieval City churches that escaped the Great Fire of London in 1666. In addition to being a local parish church, St Olave&#x27;s is the Ward Church of the Tower Ward of the City of London.

== History ==
The church is first recorded in the 13th century as &quot;St Olave-towards-the-Tower&quot;, a stone building replacing the earlier (presumably wooden) construction. It is dedicated to the patron saint of Norway, King Olaf II of Norway, who fought alongside the Anglo-Saxon King √Üthelred the Unready against the Danes in the Battle of London Bridge in 1014. He was canonised after his death and the church of St Olave&#x27;s was built apparently on the site of the battle. The Norwegian connection was reinforced during the Second World War when King Haakon VII of Norway worshipped there while in exile.

Saint Olave&#x27;s was rebuilt in the 13th century and then again in the 15th century. The present building dates from around 1450. According to John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot; (1603), a major benefactor of the church in the late 15th century was wool merchant Richard Cely Sr. (d. 1482), who held the advowson on the church (inherited by his son, Richard Cely Jr.). On his death, Cely bequeathed money for making the steeple and an altar in the church. The merchant mark of the Cely family was carved in two of the corbels in the nave (and were extant until the bombing of World War II). No memorial to the Celys now remains in the church.

Saint Olave&#x27;s survived the Great Fire of London with the help of Sir William Penn, the father of the more famous William Penn who founded Pennsylvania, and his men from the nearby Naval yards. He had ordered the men to blow up the houses surrounding the church to create a fire break. The flames came within 100 yards or so of the building, but then the wind changed direction, saving the church and a number of other churches on the eastern side of the city.

The church was a favourite of the diarist Samuel Pepys, whose house and Royal Navy office were both on Seething Lane. A regular worshipper, he referred to St. Olave&#x27;s in his diary affectionately as &quot;our own church&quot; In 1660, he had a gallery built on the south wall of the church and added an outside stairway from the Royal Navy Offices so that he could go to church without getting soaked by the rain. The gallery is now gone but a memorial to Pepys marks the location of the stairway&#x27;s door. In 1669, when his beloved wife Elisabeth died from fever, Pepys had a marble bust of her made by John Bushnell and installed on the north wall of the sanctuary so that he would be able to see her from his pew at the services. In 1703, he was buried next to his wife in the nave.

In his 1861 work, &quot;The Uncommercial Traveller&quot;, Charles Dickens described the 17th century gateway of Saint Olave&#x27;s churchyard, which has skulls and crossbones carved in its tympanum, as being &quot;one of my best beloved churchyards, I call the churchyard of Saint Ghastly Grim&quot; and recounts once visiting it after midnight during a thunderstorm to see the skulls &quot;having the air of a public execution&quot;.

However, the church was gutted by German bombs in 1941 during the London Blitz, and was restored in 1954, with King Haakon returning to preside over the rededication ceremony, during which he laid a stone from Trondheim Cathedral in front of the sanctuary.

Between 1948 and 1954, when the restored St Olave&#x27;s was reopened, a prefabricated church stood on the site of All Hallows Staining. This was known as St Olave Mark Lane. The tower of All Hallows Staining was used as the chancel of the temporary church.

The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. St Olave&#x27;s has retained long and historic links with Trinity House and the Clothworkers&#x27; Company.

== Architecture ==

St Olave&#x27;s has a modest exterior in the Perpendicular Gothic style. with a somewhat squat square tower of stone and brick, the latter added in 1732. It is famous for the macabre 1658 entrance arch to the churchyard, which is decorated with grinning skulls. The novelist Charles Dickens was so taken with this that he included the church in his book of sketches &quot;The Uncommercial Traveller&quot;, renaming it &quot;St Ghastly Grim&quot;.

The interior of St Olave&#x27;s only partially survived the wartime bombing; much of it dates from the restoration of the 1950s. It is nearly square, with three bays separated by columns of Purbeck limestone supporting pointed arches. The roof is a simple oak structure with bosses. Most of the church fittings are modern, but there are some significant survivals, such as the monument to Elizabeth Pepys and the pulpit, said to be the work of Grinling Gibbons. Following the destruction of the organ in the Blitz, the John Compton Organ Company built a new instrument in the West Gallery, fronted by a large wooden grille; this organ, and the Rectory behind, is ingeniously structured between church and tower.

In the tower, there was a memorial with an American connection. It honors Monkhouse Davison and Abraham Newman, the grocers of Fenchurch Street who shipped crates of tea to Boston in late 1773. These crates were seized and thrown into the waters during the Boston Tea Party, one of the causes of the American War of Independence.

Perhaps the oddest &quot;person&quot; said to be buried here is the &quot;Pantomime character&quot; Mother Goose. Her burial was recorded by the parish registers on 14 September 1586. A plaque on the outside commemorates this event. The churchyard is also said to contain the grave of one Mary Ramsay, popularly believed to be the woman who brought the Plague to London in 1665. The parish registers have the record of her burial, which was on 24 July 1665. Thereafter, in the same year, the victims of the Great Plague were marked with a &#x27;p&#x27; after their names in the registers.

== Bells ==
On the east side of St Olave&#x27;s, there is a stained glass window depicting Queen Elizabeth I standing with two tall bells at her feet. She held a thanksgiving service at St Olave&#x27;s on Trinity Sunday, 15 May 1554, while she was still Princess Elizabeth, to celebrate her release from the Tower of London. She had originally given bell-ropes of silk to the All Hallows Staining Church because its bells had rung the loudest of all London bells on the day of her freedom, but, when All Hallows Staining was merged with St. Olave&#x27;s in 1870, the bell-ropes went with it.

On 11 May 1941, an incendiary bomb was dropped by the Luftwaffe on the tower of the church. The tower, along with the baptistry and other buildings, was burned out and the furnishings and monuments destroyed. The heat was so great that even the peal of the eight bells were melted &quot;back into bell metal&quot;. In the early 1950s, the bell metal was recast into new bells by the same foundry that created the original bells ‚Äì the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, in 1662 and 1694. The new bells were then hung in the rebuilt tower.

There are currently nine bells at St Olave&#x27;s Hart Street consisting of one Sanctus bell and a ring of eight bells hung for full circle ringing, with the tenor of the eight weighing 11‚Äì3‚Äì23. The bells are usually rung for practices, which take place on Thursday evenings between 7:00¬†pm and 8:30¬†pm during term time, and for Sunday service between 12:20¬†pm and 13:00¬†pm every Sunday. The bells are currently rung by the University of London Society of Change Ringers (ULSCR) who have a healthy band consisting of past and present members of London Universities, along with other regular supporters.

== Organ ==
An organ was built by Samuel Green and finished in 1781. Organists include Mary Hudson, William Shrubsole, and John Turene ‚Äì all appointed 21 December 1781.

The 1781 organ was destroyed in the Blitz in 1941. After the war, a new organ was built behind a wooden grille in the west gallery by the John Compton Organ Company in 1954. It was built on the extension principle with six ranks. in 1957 three additional ranks were added. It now has 43 stops controlled from a drawstop console in the west gallery .

== Peter Turner ==

Peter Turner was a notable physician in the 16th and early 17th century and adherent of Paracelsus, and was buried in the church along with his father William Turner, also a famed physician and naturalist. When he died in 1614, a memorial bust was crafted and placed in the south-east corner of the church. When the church was gutted during the Blitz, the bust went missing. It was not seen until April 2010 when it reappeared at a UK art auction. When it was recognised, the sale was frozen and negotiations took place via the Art Loss Register to return the bust to the church. It was finally returned to its original location within St Olave&#x27;s in 2011 after an absence of more than 70 years.

<doc id="683648" wikidata="Q5456372" url="?curid=683648" title="Fixed investment">
<text>Fixed investment in economics is the purchase of newly produced physical asset, or, fixed capital. It is measured as a flow variable ‚Äì that is, as an amount per unit of time.

Thus, fixed investment is the sum of physical assets such as machinery, land, buildings, installations, vehicles, or technology. Normally, a company balance sheet will state both the amount of expenditure on fixed assets during the quarter or year, and the total value of the stock of fixed assets owned.

Fixed investment contrasts with investments in labour, ongoing operating expenses, materials or financial assets. Financial assets may also be held for a fixed term (for example, bonds) but they are not usually called &quot;fixed investment&quot; because they do not involve the purchase of physical fixed assets. The more usual term for such financial investments is &quot;fixed-term investments&quot;. Bank deposits committed for a fixed term such as one or two years in a savings account are similarly called &quot;fixed-term deposits&quot;.

Statistical measures of fixed investment, such as provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the United States, Eurostat in Europe, and other national and international statistical offices (e.g., the International Monetary Fund), are often considered by economists to be important indicators of longer-term economic growth (the growth of output and employment) and potential productivity.

The more fixed capital is used per worker, the more productive the worker can be, other things being equal. For example, a worker who tills the soil only with a spade is normally less productive than a worker who uses a tractor-driven plough to do the same work, because with a tractor one can plough more land in less time, and thus produce more in less time, even if a tractor costs more than a spade. Obviously one would not normally use a tractor to plough a small garden, but in large-scale farming the income earned using a tractor by far outweighs the expense of using a tractor. It is not economical to use a spade for large-scale ploughing, unless the labour is extremely cheap, and the supply of labour is plentiful.

The level of fixed investment by businesses also indicates something about the level of confidence that business owners or managers have about the ability to earn more income from sales in the next few years. The reasoning is that they would be unlikely to tie up additional capital in fixed assets for several years or more, unless they thought it would be a commercially viable proposition in the longer term. If there is too much uncertainty about whether their fixed investment will pay off, they are unlikely to engage in it.

In recent decades, the growth rate of fixed investment in the US, Europe and Japan was relatively low, but in China for example it is relatively high. Often the relativities are expressed as a ratio between gross fixed capital formation and GDP, or fixed investment per worker employed or per capita.

==Why fixed?==

The use of the term &quot;fixed&quot; does necessarily not mean the asset &quot;stays in one place&quot;, i.e., it does not mean that it is physically &quot;immobile&quot;, but it refers rather to the circulation (rotation) of flows of capital.

Normally, for the purpose of accounting, fixed investment refers to &quot;physical assets held for one year or more&quot;. The investment capital is therefore &quot;fixed&quot;, in the precise sense that the capital is tied up in physical assets for a longer time, and thus cannot be used for other purposes. This contrasts with, for example, investment capital in the form of liquid bank deposits earning interest, or investment in raw materials completely used up in (say) five weeks to produce products which, upon sale, earn income the following month.

The term &quot;fixed investment&quot; may be somewhat ambiguous, because it could refer to the value of a &quot;stock&quot; of fixed assets being held at a balance date, or as in economics, to the value of a &quot;flow of expenditures&quot; on fixed assets across an accounting interval, such as a year. The distinction is not always clearly stated in statistical tabulations‚Äîthey might refer either to the stock of capital tied up in fixed assets at a balance date, or to how much was spent on fixed equipment during a quarter or year.

==Measurement==

The amount of fixed investment may be stated &quot;gross&quot; (before taking into account depreciation) or &quot;net&quot; (after depreciation). By subtracting disposals of fixed assets from additions to fixed assets in an accounting period, we obtain a measure of the net (fixed) capital formation.

In official statistics, attempts are often made to estimate the value of fixed capital assets in a nation, the value of their depreciation (or consumption of fixed capital) and the value of gross fixed capital formation by sector and type of asset. Fixed assets depreciate over time, due to wear and tear and market obsolescence. At the end of their useful lifetime (perhaps 7‚Äì10 years), they possess only a scrap-value (or at the very least must undergo maintenance work or repairs).

The concept of &quot;gross fixed capital formation&quot; (GFCF) used in official statistics however does not refer to &quot;total fixed investment&quot; in a country.

*Firstly GFCF measures only the value of &quot;additions&quot; to the fixed capital stock &quot;less&quot; the value of disposals of scrapped fixed assets. So normally total fixed investment in a year is in fact a larger value than GFCF. &quot;Total fixed investment&quot; (gross) is not usually a published statistical measure, since economists are interested primarily in the contribution of fixed investment to value added, i.e., they are interested in the net additions made to the total fixed capital stock (additions less withdrawals). If, hypothetically, the amount of fixed investment and the amount of scrapped fixed assets are equal in value, then the total fixed investment figure would tell us only that the scrapped fixed assets have been replaced. If we want to know by how much the fixed capital stock has increased, we need to know the relationship between fixed assets purchased and disposals of fixed assets.
*Secondly, GFCF does not include land purchases, only investments in land improvement, mainly because land purchased by one person or company from another does not normally increase the total amount of land there is (except in cases of land reclamation such as polders). All that happens is that the same land changes owners. If land is sold, it may yield a capital gain for the seller, but such profits from land sales are not usually made explicit in official statistics, in part because a standard valuation of what the land was previously worth is often difficult to operationalize, in particular if the land was improved or developed by the seller. The value of land can increase or decline due to all kinds of factors, and land valuations may differ from place to place. At best one could estimate the total value of land sales in an accounting interval.

For statistical purposes, investment in fixed capital must be distinguished from investment in intermediate goods. Unlike fixed assets, intermediate goods (for example, commodities like oil, electricity, timber, steel and grain) are completely used up in production (usually within a year). But this distinction is not always easy to draw, for example:

*if raw materials are held for more than one year before they are used,
*if expenditure occurs to install, service, insure or repair fixed assets (which can be part of the purchase contract)
*if physical &quot;fixed&quot; assets are sold off again in less than one year.

In official statistics, various accounting conventions are adopted to deal with these problems in a standardized way. A further complication is that scrapped fixed assets, being second-hand goods, may be resold and re-used again (for example, second-hand vehicles).

==Theories of fixed investment determination==

One theory of the determination of fixed investment focuses on the discrepancy between the current quantity of the fixed capital stock and the optimal or target capital stock. The target capital stock‚Äîthe level at which a firm&#x27;s profits would be highest if actual fixed capital holdings equaled that level‚Äîis determined as the level at which the marginal product of capital equals the marginal cost of capital. Then the flow of net investment per unit of time is determined by balancing losses from having a less-than-optimal level of capital with the adjustment costs of installing new capital; these adjustment costs in per-unit terms may be an increasing function of the speed of installation.

Another theory of fixed investment determination is based on Tobin&#x27;s q, the ratio of the market value to the acquisition cost of an additional unit of physical capital; investment is hypothesized to be an increasing function of this ratio.

==Trends==

Fixed investments nowadays can be enormous (for example, a nuclear power plant might be built for three billion dollars). This creates more risk and means that many financial guarantees and insurance arrangements become necessary.

<text>Warwick and Leamington is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since the 2017 general election by Matt Western of the Labour Party.

==Boundaries==
1885‚Äì1918: The existing parliamentary borough of Warwick, the municipal borough of Royal Leamington Spa, and the local government districts of Milverton and Lillington.

1918‚Äì1950: The Boroughs of Warwick, Royal Leamington Spa, and Stratford-on-Avon, the Urban District of Kenilworth, the Rural Districts of Warwick and Alcester, and parts of the Rural Districts of Stratford-on-Avon and Brailes.

1950‚Äì1974: The Boroughs of Warwick and Royal Leamington Spa, the Urban District of Kenilworth, and the Rural District of Warwick.

1974‚Äì1983: As 1950 but with redrawn boundaries.

1983‚Äì1997: The District of Warwick wards of Bishop&#x27;s Tachbrook, Brunswick, Budbrooke, Clarendon, Crown, Cubbington, Lapworth, Leek Wootton, Manor, Milverton, Radford Semele, Warwick North, Warwick South, Warwick West, Whitnash, and Willes.

1997‚Äì2010: The District of Warwick wards of Bishop&#x27;s Tachbrook, Brunswick, Budbrooke, Clarendon, Crown, Cubbington, Lapworth, Leek Wootton, Manor, Milverton, Radford Semele, Warwick North, Warwick South, Warwick West, Whitnash, and Willes, and the District of Stratford-on-Avon wards of Henley, Tanworth, and Tanworth Earlswood.

:&quot;The 2010 boundary changes reduced the constituency&#x27;s area by removing outlying villages, reflecting population and housing growth.&quot;
2024‚Äìpresent: The District of Warwick wards of: Bishop‚Äôs Tachbrook; Leamington Brunswick; Leamington Clarendon; Leamington Lillington; Leamington Milverton; Leamington Willes; Radford Semele; Warwick All Saints and Woodloes; Warwick Aylesford; Warwick Myton &amp; Heathcote; Warwick Saltisford; Whitnash.
:&quot;Minor changes to align boundaries with those of wards in the District of Warwick. Budbrooke transferred to Kenilworth and Southam in exchange for Radford Semele.&quot;

==Constituency profile==
The seat comprises the two eponymous towns, with modest hills surrounding them, in the upper valley of the River Avon.

The towns of Warwick and Royal Leamington Spa are still distinct, however, and form, in the modern seat, a urban area. Both towns are relatively affluent, although there are pockets of deprivation in Leamington. Warwick, with its historic castle, is an internationally advertised tourist destination, while Leamington&#x27;s economy is more dependent on storage, distribution, manufacturing, processing, engineering and industry. Leamington is also more ethnically diverse (e.g. five per cent of the constituency&#x27;s population is of Asian ethnicity) and is home to some students of the University of Warwick that lies close to Coventry.

Unemployment claimants who were registered jobseekers were in November 2012 significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 2.2% of the population based on a statistical compilation by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==History==
The constituency was created under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, partially replacing the earlier and ancient Warwick constituency which until that year had sent two MPs to Westminster.

===Political history===
Represented solely by Members of Parliament from the Conservative Party for 87 years from 1910-97, the seat was for much of this time a safe seat; seeing frequent majorities of more than 10,000 votes, and the seat was uncontested at both the 1918 and 1922 general elections. The seat had not been expected to change hands at the 1997 general election: as such James Plaskitt&#x27;s defeat of Dudley Smith was a Portillo moment, without the decapitation of a government frontbencher. Plaskitt increased his majority at the 2001 general election, but on a lower turnout. At the 2005 general election, Warwick and Leamington was 85th on the Conservative list of target seats, meaning that to gain it they would have required a somewhat greater swing than was seen nationally. With a greater swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats, Plaskitt narrowly retained the seat with a majority slashed from nearly 6,000 votes to a mere 266.

However, minor boundary changes in Labour&#x27;s favour took effect at the 2010 general election and the winner was variously predicted. In 2010, the seat was gained by a Conservative, Chris White, with a majority of 7% of the vote. On this occasion, the Conservative Party was the main beneficiary from swings away from the Labour Party and the Green Party. White held the seat in 2015 with an increased majority of 6,606 votes. The Labour candidate, Matt Western gained the seat from the Conservatives on a swing of 7.6% at the 2017 snap general election, overturning a majority of 6,606 votes. (this was the fourth-largest lead overturned by Labour at the 2017 general election). This made Matt Western the second MP for Warwick and Leamington from the Labour Party in the history of the constituency. At the 2019 general election, Western held the seat with a slightly reduced majority, and in 2024 Western was re-elected with an increased majority of 12,412 votes, the largest majority for a Labour candidate in the seat&#x27;s history.

===Prominent members===
From 1923-57, the seat was represented by  Anthony Eden, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1955-57.

For part of the early-1920s, the Solicitor General for England and Wales, then Attorney General for England and Wales, represented the seat, Sir Ernest Pollock. Eden&#x27;s successor, Sir John Hobson, was also in all of those senior positions for part of the early-1960s.

<text>Hollandsche Bank-Unie (HBU) was a second-tier domestic bank in the Netherlands that Deutsche Bank absorbed in 2010. It had a notable international history.

==History==
===Establishment===
On 28 March 1914, the Rotterdamsche Bank, together with the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (NHM) and several smaller firms, established the &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor Zuid-Amerika&quot; (Holland Bank for South-America). The bank opened in Buenos Aires under the name &quot;Banco Holand√©s de la Am√©rica del Sud&quot; (Banco Holand√©s). In 1916 the bank opened a second branch in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1919 a branch in S√£o Paulo. By 1922, the &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor Zuid-Amerika&quot; was running branches in Genoa, Hamburg, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Santiago, S√£o Paulo and Valpara√≠so.

In 1918 the &quot;Rotterdamsche Bank&quot; and the NHM, together with smaller shareholders such as the &quot;Royal West India Mail/Royal Netherlands Steamship Company&quot; and the subsidiary of Shell that ran Cura√ßao&#x27;s refinery, as well as &quot;Bank of Suriname&quot; decided to create a similar bank for the West-Indies. The &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor West-Indi√´&quot; was established with head office in Amsterdam to operate branches in Willemstad, Cura√ßao. In 1920 this bank was the first European bank to open a branch in Caracas.

In 1919, a year after the founding of &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor West-Indi√´&quot;, the &quot;Rotterdamsche Bank&quot; joined with the &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor Zuid-Amerika&quot; to establish the &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor de Middellandsche Zee&quot; (Holland bank for the Mediterranean). It opened branches in Genoa, Barcelona, Marseilles, Constantinople, and later Tel Aviv.

===Development===
The Hollandsche Bank-Unie (HBU) was established in 1933 out of a merger between the &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor Zuid-Amerika&quot; and the &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor de Middellandsche Zee&quot;. It acquired the &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor West-Indi√´&quot; in 1935. The HBU made further acquisitions, &quot;S. van Dantzig &amp; Co&quot; in 1939, and &quot;‚Ä≥s Gravenhaagsche Creditvereeniging en Depositkas&quot; in 1941.

Further branches were established in Uruguay (1952) and Beirut (1954), so that by 1957, the HBU maintained branches in the Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, Argentina, Brazil, Israel, Turkey, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Suriname. The branch network was expanded further into Ecuador, and in 1965 into Paraguay. After the 6-Day War in 1967 the branches in Israel were closed.

===ABN Era===
The Algemene Bank Nederland acquired HBU in 1968, but it continued to operate HBU as a separate subsidiary under the HBU name. ABN decided to merge all its activities in the Netherlands Antilles under the name &quot;Antilliaanse Bank Unie&quot;. This meant a merger of the HBU&#x27;s Netherlands Antilles branches, &quot;Aruba Commercial Bank&quot; (est. 1949), &quot;Bonaire Commercial Bank&quot; (est. 1962), and &quot;Edwards, Henriques &amp; Co.&quot; (est. 1856).

In 1972 ABN absorbed all of HBU&#x27;s overseas branches. HBU&#x27;s international history ended in 2001 when ABN AMRO sold the Ecuadorian operation it had inherited from the HBU to Banco del Pichincha (est. 1906). The HBU name continued as a small Netherlands domestic operation within ABN.

In 2007 Fortis, which had obtained HBU in conjunction with its acquisition of ABN AMRO&#x27;s operations in 2007, arranged its sale in 2009 to Deutsche Bank to comply with EU competition requirements. The Dutch government initially blocked the sale when the government took control of the Dutch parts of Fortis bank. However, after further negotiations, the sale was finally approved and completed on 1 April 2010 for 700 million Euro. Deutsche Bank absorbed HBU and its activities; this ended the HBU name.

<text>Holy Sepulchre London, formerly and in some official uses Saint Sepulchre-without-Newgate, is the largest Anglican parish church in the City of London. It stands on the north side of Holborn Viaduct across a crossroads from the Old Bailey, and its parish takes in Smithfield Market. During medieval times, the site lay outside (&quot;without&quot;) the city wall, west of the Newgate.

It has London&#x27;s musicians&#x27; chapel in which a book of remembrance sits and an October/November requiem takes place ‚Äì unusual for a church associated with Low Church Evangelicalism. The church has two local army regiment memorials.

The vicar is appointed by St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, which has held the church&#x27;s patronage since 1622.

The church is within the Newgate Street Conservation Area.

==History==
The original (probably pre-Norman) church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. In 1137 it was given to the Priory of St Bartholomew. During the Crusades of that century the church was re-dedicated to Saint Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, venerating the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Knights passed by on the way to the Holy Lands. This name became contracted, and in the 21st century reference to the saint-king has been overwhelmingly dropped. The very early lessening of the first dedication helped to reserve that name for the small church to the east of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral dedicated
to St Edmund, King and Martyr.

The church is today the largest parish church in the city. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666, which left the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing. It was rebuilt 1667‚Äì1679 by Joshua Marshall, the King&#x27;s Master Mason, and appears to be remodelled to Marshall&#x27;s own design. Lightly modified in the 18th century, the interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling installed in 1834 with plasterwork of three years later. The church underwent considerable re-facing and alterations in 1878. During the Second World War the 18th-century watch-house, built in the churchyard to deter grave-robbers, was bomb-struck but later rebuilt. The vicarage was fully renovated in the early 2000s.
During Mary I&#x27;s persecutions, in 1555, the incumbent vicar John Rogers was burned at the stake as a heretic.

===Bells===
The bells are referred to in the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;.

In 1605, London merchant tailor John Dowe paid the parish ¬£50 () to buy a handbell and to mark the execution of prisoners at the nearby gallows at Newgate. This execution bell is displayed in a glass case in the nave. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the clerk was responsible for ringing it outside the condemned man&#x27;s cell in Newgate Prison the night before his execution, and announcing the following &quot;wholesome advice&quot;:
Given proximity to Newgate Prison and the Old Bailey, built on the site of the prison, certain of the bells in its tower, aside from marking time, celebrating weddings and communion, were rung to announce executions. In the first years of the court this was as the condemned felon was led to Tyburn.
===Musicians&#x27; Chapel===
By the north aisle is the Musicians&#x27; Chapel. As St Stephen&#x27;s chapel it hosted votive masses to the 12th-century monastic saint Stephen Harding prior to the English Reformation and during the reign of Mary I of England.

The ashes of conductor Sir Henry Wood, founder of , who learnt to play the organ at the church as a boy, were interred here in the 1940s.

It was rededicated to musicians by Dr. W.R. Matthews, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, on 2 January 1955 in the presence of many distinguished musicians including an orchestra conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and the BBC Singers. Its four windows commemorate Sir Henry Wood, John Ireland,
Dame Nellie Melba and
Walter Carroll

The chapel&#x27;s appearance and the Musicians&#x27; Book of Remembrance are maintained by the Friends of the Musicians&#x27; Chapel. A Service of Thanksgiving for all those in the book is held at the church each year as well as a requiem close to All Souls&#x27; Day. Many concerts and memorial events for musicians have been held in the church. In 2017 the vicar ceased parish funds financing the requiem and allowing of most free rehearsing time. A protest was held and many prominent musicians including John Rutter sought continued benevolence from the wider congregation and church patron. Attempts to mediate failed.

===Army memorials===
The south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) (merged to form the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers), to whom its gardens are a memorial. The west end of the north aisle has memorials for the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment).

==Protection and recognition of architecture==
The church has been designated a Grade I listed building (the highest grade) since 1950.

==Notable people associated with the church==
* Thomas Culpeper, Tudor courtier, buried here
* Thomas Gouge, minister ejected in 1662
* Samuel Gurney, MP, erected the first drinking fountain for the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association on the railings of the church. It was restored to the original location in 1913 and remains there.
* Rev Dr Peter Mullen, commentator, author and former rector, sometime chaplain to the London Stock Exchange
* John Rogers, minister, Bible translator, and the first English Protestant martyr under Mary I of England; he was burnt at the stake
* Sir Anthony St Leger, Tudor judge, and his first wife Eleanor Markham, buried here
* Sir John Smith, governor of Virginia and associate of Pocahontas, buried 1631 in the south aisle. Smith is also commemorated by a window designed by Francis Skeat and installed in 1968.
* Austin Osman Spare, artist, attended the church school, now a physiotherapy centre, behind the church in Snow Hill Court
* Roger Williams (1603‚Äì1683), founder of Rhode Island, USA
* Sir Henry Wood, founding conductor at the Proms

==Organ==

The north aisle is dominated by a splendid organ built by Renatus Harris in 1670; the organ case is its sole mention in the architectural listing, adding a date, 1677.

The swell was added by John Byfield in . The organ was enlarged in 1817 by James Hancock and by John Gray in 1828 and 1835, and Gray and Davison in 1849, 1852 and 1855. It was rebuilt in 1932 by Harrison and Harrison. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. It is not currently playable, though efforts are being made to restore it to a playable condition. A Makin digital organ is used when required for services.

The choir has now composed of eight professional singers.

<doc id="683672" wikidata="Q570342" url="?curid=683672" title="Extremely high frequency">
<text>Extremely high frequency (EHF) is the International Telecommunication Union designation for the band of radio frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum from 30 to 300 gigahertz (GHz). It is in the microwave part of the radio spectrum, between the super high frequency band and the terahertz band. Radio waves in this band have wavelengths from ten to one millimeter, so it is also called the millimeter band and radiation in this band is called millimeter waves, sometimes abbreviated MMW or mmWave. 

Some define mmWaves as starting at 24 GHz, thus covering the entire FR2 band (24.25 to 71 GHz), among others.

Compared to lower bands, radio waves in this band have high atmospheric attenuation: they are absorbed by the gases in the atmosphere. Absorption increases with frequency until at the top end of the band the waves are attenuated to zero within a few meters. Absorption by humidity in the atmosphere is significant except in desert environments, and attenuation by rain (rain fade) is a serious problem even over short distances. However the short propagation range allows smaller frequency reuse distances than lower frequencies. The short wavelength allows modest size antennas to have a small beam width, further increasing frequency reuse potential. Millimeter waves are used for military fire-control radar, airport security scanners, short range wireless networks, and scientific research.

In a major new application of millimeter waves, certain frequency ranges near the bottom of the band are being used in the newest generation of cell phone networks, 5G networks. The design of millimeter-wave circuit and subsystems (such as antennas, power amplifiers, mixers and oscillators) also presents severe challenges to engineers due to semiconductor and process limitations, model limitations and poor &quot;Q&quot; factors of passive devices.

== Propagation ==
Millimeter waves propagate solely by line-of-sight paths. They are not refracted by the ionosphere nor do they travel along the Earth as ground waves as lower frequency radio waves do. At typical power densities they are blocked by building walls and suffer significant attenuation passing through foliage. Absorption by atmospheric gases is a significant factor throughout the band and increases with frequency. However, this absorption is maximum at a few specific absorption lines, mainly those of oxygen at 60¬†GHz and water vapor at 24¬†GHz and 184¬†GHz. At frequencies in the &quot;windows&quot; between these absorption peaks, millimeter waves have much less atmospheric attenuation and greater range, so many applications use these frequencies. Millimeter wavelengths are the same order of size as raindrops, so precipitation causes additional attenuation due to scattering (rain fade) as well as absorption. The high free space loss and atmospheric absorption limit useful propagation to a few kilometers. Thus, they are useful for densely packed communications networks such as personal area networks that improve spectrum utilization through frequency reuse.

Millimeter waves show &quot;optical&quot; propagation characteristics and can be reflected and focused by small metal surfaces and dielectric lenses around 5 to 30¬†cm (2 inches to 1 foot) diameter. Because their wavelengths are often much smaller than the equipment that manipulates them, the techniques of geometric optics can be used. Diffraction is less than at lower frequencies, although millimeter waves can be diffracted by building edges. At millimeter wavelengths, surfaces appear rougher so diffuse reflection increases. Multipath propagation, particularly reflection from indoor walls and surfaces, causes serious fading. Doppler shift of frequency can be significant even at pedestrian speeds. In portable devices, shadowing due to the human body is a problem. Since the waves penetrate clothing and their small wavelength allows them to reflect from small metal objects they are used in millimeter wave scanners for airport security scanning.

== Applications ==

=== Scientific research ===

This band is commonly used in radio astronomy and remote sensing. Ground-based radio astronomy is limited to high altitude sites such as Kitt Peak and Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) due to atmospheric absorption issues.

Satellite-based remote sensing near 60¬†GHz can determine temperature in the upper atmosphere by measuring radiation emitted from oxygen molecules that is a function of temperature and pressure. The International Telecommunication Union non-exclusive passive frequency allocation at 57‚Äì59.3¬†GHz is used for atmospheric monitoring in meteorological and climate sensing applications and is important for these purposes due to the properties of oxygen absorption and emission in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Currently operational U.S. satellite sensors such as the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) on one NASA satellite (Aqua) and four NOAA (15‚Äì18) satellites and the special sensor microwave/imager (SSMI/S) on Department of Defense satellite F-16 make use of this frequency range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comments of IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, FCC RM-11104, 10/17/07&quot;&gt;FCC.gov, Comments of IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, FCC RM-11104, 10/17/07&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
In the United States, the band 36.0‚Äì40.0¬†GHz is used for licensed high-speed microwave data links, and the 60¬†GHz band can be used for unlicensed short range (1.7¬†km) data links with data throughputs up to 2.5 Gbit/s. It is used commonly in flat terrain.

The 71‚Äì76, 81‚Äì86 and 92‚Äì95¬†GHz bands are also used for point-to-point high-bandwidth communication links. These higher frequencies do not suffer from oxygen absorption, but require a transmitting license in the US from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). There are plans for 10¬†Gbit/s links using these frequencies as well. In the case of the 92‚Äì95¬†GHz band, a small 100¬†MHz range has been reserved for space-borne radios, limiting this reserved range to a transmission rate of under a few gigabits per second.

The band is essentially undeveloped and available for use in a broad range of new products and services, including high-speed, point-to-point wireless local area networks and broadband Internet access. WirelessHD is another recent technology that operates near the 60¬†GHz range. Highly directional, &quot;pencil-beam&quot; signal characteristics permit different systems to operate close to one another without causing interference. Potential applications include radar systems with very high resolution.

The Wi-Fi standards IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.11ay operate in the 60¬†GHz (V band) spectrum to achieve data transfer rates as high as 7 Gbit/s and at least 20 Gbit/s, respectively.

Uses of the millimeter wave bands include point-to-point communications, intersatellite links, and point-to-multipoint communications. In 2013 it was speculated that there were plans to use millimeter waves in future 5G mobile phones. In addition, use of millimeter wave bands for vehicular communication is also emerging as an attractive solution to support (semi-)autonomous vehicular communications.

Shorter wavelengths in this band permit the use of smaller antennas to achieve the same high directivity and high gain as larger ones in lower bands. The immediate consequence of this high directivity, coupled with the high free space loss at these frequencies, is the possibility of a more efficient use of frequencies for point-to-multipoint applications. Since a greater number of highly directive antennas can be placed in a given area, the net result is greater frequency reuse, and higher density of users. The high usable channel capacity in this band might allow it to serve some applications that would otherwise use fiber-optic communication or very short links such as for the interconnect of circuit boards.

=== Weapons systems ===

Millimeter wave radar is used in short-range fire-control radar in tanks and aircraft, and automated guns (CIWS) on naval ships to shoot down incoming missiles. The small wavelength of millimeter waves allows them to track the stream of outgoing bullets as well as the target, allowing the computer fire control system to change the aim to bring them together. 

With Raytheon the U.S. Air Force has developed a nonlethal antipersonnel weapon system called Active Denial System (ADS) which emits a beam of millimeter radio waves with a wavelength of 3¬†mm (frequency of 95¬†GHz). The weapon causes a person in the beam to feel an intense burning pain, as if their skin is going to catch fire. The military version had an output power of 100 kilowatts (kW), and a smaller law enforcement version, called Silent Guardian that was developed by Raytheon later, had an output power of 30¬†kW.

=== Security screening ===
Clothing and other organic materials are transparent to millimeter waves of certain frequencies, so a recent application has been scanners to detect weapons and other dangerous objects carried under clothing, for applications such as airport security. Privacy advocates are concerned about the use of this technology because, in some cases, it allows screeners to see airport passengers as if without clothing.

The TSA has deployed millimeter wave scanners to many major airports.

Prior to a software upgrade the technology did not mask any part of the bodies of the people who were being scanned. However, passengers&#x27; faces were deliberately masked by the system. The photos were screened by technicians in a closed room, then deleted immediately upon search completion. Privacy advocates are concerned. &quot;We&#x27;re getting closer and closer to a required strip-search to board an airplane,&quot; said Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union. To address this issue, upgrades have eliminated the need for an officer in a separate viewing area. The new software generates a generic image of a human. There is no anatomical differentiation between male and female on the image, and if an object is detected, the software only presents a yellow box in the area. If the device does not detect anything of interest, no image is presented. Passengers can decline scanning and be screened via a metal detector and patted down.

According to Farran Technologies, a manufacturer of one model of the millimeter wave scanner, the technology exists to extend the search area to as far as 50 meters beyond the scanning area which would allow security workers to scan a large number of people without their awareness that they are being scanned.

=== Thickness gauging ===
Recent studies at the University of Leuven have proven that millimeter waves can also be used as a non-nuclear thickness gauge in various industries. Millimeter waves provide a clean and contact-free way of detecting variations in thickness. Practical applications for the technology focus on plastics extrusion, paper manufacturing, glass production and mineral wool production.

=== Medicine ===

Low intensity (usually 10¬†mW/cm2 or less) electromagnetic radiation of extremely high frequency may be used in human medicine for the treatment of diseases. For example, &quot;A brief, low-intensity MMW exposure can change cell growth and proliferation rates, activity of enzymes, state of cell genetic apparatus, function of excitable membranes and peripheral receptors.&quot; This treatment is particularly associated with the range of 40‚Äì70 GHz. This type of treatment may be called &quot;millimeter wave therapy&quot; or &quot;extremely high frequency therapy&quot;. This treatment is associated with eastern European nations (e.g., former USSR nations). The Russian Journal &quot;Millimeter waves in biology and medicine&quot; studies the scientific basis and clinical applications of millimeter wave therapy.

=== Police speed radar ===
Traffic police use speed-detecting radar guns in the Ka-band (33.4‚Äì36.0¬†GHz).

== History ==
Millimeter-length electromagnetic waves were first investigated by Jagadish Chandra Bose, who generated waves of frequency up to 60GHz during experiments in 18941896.

<text>St Margaret Pattens is a Church of England church in the City of London, located on Eastcheap near the Monument. The dedication is to Saint Margaret of Antioch.

==History==
The church was first recorded in 1067, at which time the church was probably built from wood. It was rebuilt in stone at some unknown subsequent date but fell into disrepair and had to be demolished in 1530. It was rebuilt in 1538 but was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The present church was built by Sir Christopher Wren in 1687. It is one of only a few City churches to have escaped significant damage in the Second World War.

In 1954 St Margaret Pattens ceased to be a parish church and became one of the City‚Äôs guild churches, within the living of the Lord Chancellor and under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of London. They have a regular weekday, rather than Sunday congregation, drawn mostly from people who work in offices nearby. The tower accommodates the office of the Archdeacon of Hackney.

The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

==Building==
The church&#x27;s exterior is notable for its 200-ft high spire, Wren&#x27;s third highest and the only one that he designed in a medieval style. This is sometimes referred to as Wren&#x27;s only &quot;true spire&quot;. The church‚Äôs interior is a simple rectangle with some unusual fittings ‚Äì the only canopied pews in London, dating from the 17th century. These were intended for the churchwardens. The initials &quot;CW&quot; which appear in one of the pews have been thought to refer to Christopher Wren, but they may also signify &quot;church warden.&quot; Other features in the interior include a punishment box carved with the Devil&#x27;s head where wrongdoers had to sit during the church service.

==Name==
The church&#x27;s name is traditionally said to derive from &quot;pattens&quot;, wooden-soled overshoes, later soled with raised iron rings, that, as elsewhere, parishioners would be asked to remove on entering the church. These raised shoes enabled people to walk about the streets of London without muddying their feet. The church has certainly long been associated with their Livery Company, The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers.

Another possibility is that the church&#x27;s name actually commemorates a benefactor, possibly one Ranulf Patin, a canon at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral during the medieval period, although it would be most unusual for a benefactor to be commemorated in this way.

<text>Panchkula district was formed as the 17th district of the Indian state of Haryana on 15August 1995. It comprises two sub divisions and two tehsils: Panchkula and Kalka. It has 264 villages, out of which 12 are uninhabited and ten wholly merged with towns or treated as census towns according to the 1991 census. There are five towns in the district: [[Barwala, Panchkula|Barwala]], [[Kalka]], [[Panchkula]], [[Pinjore]] and [[Raipur Rani]]. The total population of the district is 319,398 out of which 173,557 are males and 145,841 are females.

, it was the least populous district of Haryana.

Panchkula city is the headquarters of this district. Chandimandir Cantonment is located in this district, adjoining the Panchkula Urban Estate.

==Languages and Dialects Spoken==

The primary languages spoken in the district are Hindi, Standard Haryanvi and Puadhi dialect of Punjabi. While both languages are widely used in urban and rural settings, the prevalence of the Puadhi is a defining characteristic of Panchkula district&#x27;s rural culture.

== History ==
Panchkula takes its name from &quot;Panch khul&quot;, five natural springs in the area. The earlier main town in the region was Pinjore. Near the later part of the 7th century and early part of the 8th century, the district was part of the empires of Yasovarman of Kannauj and Lalitaditya Muktapida of Kashmir. It was part of the empire of Mihir Bhoj of the Gujara-Pratihara dynasty. In the 10th century CE, the region was raided by Mahmud of Ghazni several times. However it was soon brought back to peace by the Chauhans of Delhi, until Muhammad Ghori defeated Prithviraj Chauhan in 1192, when it became part of the Delhi Sultanate.

In 1254, Nasiruddin Muhammad plundered Pinjore, an event recorded in the Tabakhat-i-Nasiri. Timur sacked Pinjore on his return from Delhi. After Timur&#x27;s invasion, Panchkula fell out of central control until 1450, when Bahlol Lodhi, then governor of Punjab, restored central control over the region as Sultan. Panchkula remained in Lodhi hands until Babur crushed the Lodhis at the Battle of Panipat and set up the Mughal Empire. Panchkula was part of the Sirhind Sarkar of Delhi Subah. During the reign of Aurangzeb, Fidai Khan Koka, his Master of Ordinance, constructed the Pinjore Gardens (now called Yadvindra Gardens) for use by Aurangzeb as a summer retreat.

After Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707, Banda Singh Bahadur, a disciple of Guru Gobind Singh, ravaged erstwhile Ambala district, including Panchkula, but was defeated at the Battle of Sadhaura in 1710. In 1739, the region was plundered again by Nader Shah. After his retreat, the region was dotted with various minor principalities such as Ramgarh, Raipur, Kotaha and Kizhirabad, which were practically independent. In 1755, Adina Beg defeated Qutub Khan, and in return was given the sarkar of Sirhind, included present Panchkula district. In 1753, Ahmed Shah Abdali invaded the region and took over the Sirhind Sarkar. Afghan rule was ended when the Sikhs killed Abdali&#x27;s governor, Zain Khan Sirhindi, in 1763. Afterwards Panchkula district became part of various Sikh misls, and was incorporated into the Sikh Empire.

In 1805, the British conquered the region from the Sikhs, and made it part of the Ambala district. The 1857 Rebellion had a nerve centre in nearby Ambala, and Panchkula played a role in supporting the rebels. After the suppression of the rebellion, the region was made part of the British Raj. Panchkula became part of the Ambala district.

Ambala produced many freedom fighters such as Lala Muralidhar, who exhorted the people to fight against the British. At the time of Partition in 1947, Panchkula, like the rest of Punjab, saw riots which forced its Muslim population to flee to Pakistan and their replacement by Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan. In 1950, the city of Chandigarh was founded in the then-middle of Punjab, situated very close to Panchkula. In 1966, Punjab was trifurcated into Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Ambala district was split and part of it went to Punjab, while the Panchkula and Ambala areas came to Haryana. In the 1970s, the Haryana Government began the construction of Panchkula as a planned city. In 1995, the district was split off from Ambala district.

==Demographics==


According to the 2011 census of India, Panchkula district had a population of 561,293, This ranked it 537th in India out of a total of 640 districts. The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 19.32%.

<text>Ariel Durant (; May 10, 1898 ‚Äì October 25, 1981) was a Ukrainian-born American researcher and writer. She was the coauthor of &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot; with her husband, Will Durant. They were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.

==Biography==
Ariel Durant was born Chaya Kaufman in Proskurov, Russian Empire (now Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine), to Jewish parents Ethel Appel Kaufman and Joseph Kaufman. Ariel later went by Ida. The family emigrated in 1900, living for several months in London 1900‚Äì01 en route to the United States, where they arrived in 1901. She had three older sisters, Sarah, Mary, and Flora, and three older brothers, Harry, Maurice, and Michael. Flora became Ariel&#x27;s companion and sometime assistant, and moved with the Durants to California.

She met her future husband when she was a student at Ferrer Modern School in New York City. He was then a teacher at the school, but resigned his post to marry Ariel. At the time of the wedding, on October 31, 1913, Ariel was 15 and Will Durant was nearly 28 years old. The wedding took place at New York City Hall, to which she roller-skated from her family&#x27;s home in Harlem. The couple had one daughter, Ethel Benvenuta Durant (1919‚Äì1986) and adopted a son, Louis Richard &quot;Lipschultz&quot; Durant (1917‚Äì2008) who was the son of Ariel&#x27;s sister Flora Kaufman Lipschultz and her former husband, Joseph Bernard Lipschultz (divorced 1928). Louis had lived in Will and Ariel&#x27;s home with his mother, Flora, when he was quite young (1920 Census).

Ariel Durant legally changed her first name to Ariel after the character from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, which was the nickname her husband gave her because he said she was &quot;strong and brave as a boy, and as swift and mischievous as an elf&quot;.

The Durants were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1968 for &quot;Rousseau and Revolution&quot;, the tenth volume of &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;. In 1977 they were presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald Ford, and Ariel was named &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; by the city of Los Angeles. The Durants received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1976.

The Durants wrote a 420-page joint autobiography, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1978 (&quot;A Dual Autobiography&quot;; later ).

The Durants died within two weeks of each other in 1981 and are buried at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. Ariel told Ethel&#x27;s daughter, Monica Mehill, that it was their differences that made them grow.

<text>In economics, net investment is spending which increases the availability of fixed capital goods or means of production and goods inventories. It is the total spending on newly produced physical capital (fixed investment) and on inventories (inventory investment)‚Äîthat is, gross investment‚Äîminus replacement investment, which simply replaces depreciated capital goods. It is productive capital formation plus net additions to the stock of housing and the stock of inventories. This figure provides a sense of the real expenditure on durable goods.

<text>Action Stroke Dance Notation (ASDN) is a dance notation system that was invented by Iver Cooper. Designed for fast writing, the notations primarily consist of &quot;action strokes&quot; that represent one of three basic actions:
* a support gesture that (e.g., hop or step)
* a touch gesture ()
* an air gesture (makes no contact)

A dance score has five sections:
* general ‚Äì describing the general movement of the dancer
* leg (or staff) ‚Äì indicating movement of the legs and feet
* arm (or staff) ‚Äì indicating movement of the arms and hands
* trunk ‚Äì indicating movement of head, neck, chest and pelvis
* notes ‚Äì detailed explanations of the movement

Scores are read from bottom to top. The horizontal dimension represents body symmetry and the vertical dimension represents time. ASDN employs abstract symbols and is visually similar to Motif description, a subset of Labanotation that is also designed for speed of writing.

<text>East China () is a region in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It mainly consists of seven provincial administrative regions, namely Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Shandong.

A concept abolished in 1978, for economical purposes the region was defined from 1949 to 1961 by the Chinese Central Government to include the provinces of (in alphabetical order) Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shandong and Zhejiang, as well as the municipality of Shanghai. In 1961, the province of Jiangxi was added to the region (previously it was considered part of South Central China).

Since the Chinese government claims Taiwan and the few outlying islands of Fujian (Kinmen and Matsu) governed by the Republic of China (Taiwanese government) as its territory, the claimed &quot;Taiwan Province, People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; is also classified in this region.

<text>Mary Daly (October 16, 1928 ‚Äì January 3, 2010) was an American radical feminist philosopher and theologian. Daly, who described herself as a &quot;radical lesbian feminist&quot;, taught at the Jesuit-run Boston College for 33 years. Once a practicing Roman Catholic, she had disavowed Christianity by the early 1970s. Daly retired from Boston College in 1999, after violating university policy by refusing to allow male students in her advanced women&#x27;s studies classes. She allowed male students in her introductory class and privately tutored those who wanted to take advanced classes.

== Early life and education ==
Mary Daly was born in Schenectady, New York, on October 16, 1928. She was an only child. Her mother was a homemaker and her father, a traveling salesman. Daly was raised in a Catholic environment; both her parents were Irish Catholics and Daly attended Catholic schools as a girl. Early in her childhood, Daly had mystical experiences in which she felt the presence of divinity in nature.

Daly received her Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the College of Saint Rose in 1950, and a Master of Arts degree in English from the Catholic University of America. She earned a PhD in religion from Saint Mary&#x27;s College in 1953.

She later earned two additional doctorates in sacred theology and philosophy from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland.

== Career ==
Daly taught classes at Boston College from 1967 to 1999, including courses in theology, feminist ethics, and patriarchy.

Daly was first threatened with dismissal when, following the publication of her first book, &quot;The Church and the Second Sex&quot; (1968), she was issued a terminal (fixed-length) contract. As a result of support from the (then all-male) student body and the general public, however, Daly was ultimately granted tenure.

Daly&#x27;s refusal to admit male students to some of her classes at Boston College also resulted in disciplinary action. While Daly argued that their presence inhibited class discussion, Boston College took the view that her actions were in violation of title IX of federal law requiring the college to ensure that no person was excluded from an education program on the basis of sex, and of the university&#x27;s own non-discrimination policy insisting that all courses be open to both male and female students.

In 1989, Daly became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press.

In 1998, a discrimination claim against the college by two male students was backed by the Center for Individual Rights, a libertarian advocacy group. Following further reprimand, Daly absented herself from classes rather than admit the male students. Boston College removed her tenure rights, citing a verbal agreement by Daly to retire. She brought suit against the college disputing violation of her tenure rights and claimed she was forced out against her will, but her request for an injunction was denied by Middlesex Superior Court Judge Martha Sosman.

A confidential out-of-court settlement was reached. The college maintains that Daly had agreed to retire from her faculty position, while others assert she was forced out. Daly maintained that Boston College wronged her students by depriving her of her right to teach freely to only female students. She documented her account of the events in the 2006 book, &quot;Amazon Grace: Recalling the Courage to Sin Big&quot;.

Daly protested the commencement speech of Condoleezza Rice at Boston College, and she spoke on campuses around the United States as well as internationally.

Daly died on January 3, 2010, in Gardner, Massachusetts.

== Works ==
Daly published a number of works, and is perhaps best known for her second book, &quot;Beyond God the Father&quot; (1973). &quot;Beyond God the Father&quot; is the last book in which Daly really considers God a substantive subject. She laid out her systematic theology, following Paul Tillich&#x27;s example. Often regarded as a foundational work in feminist theology, &quot;Beyond God the Father&quot; is her attempt to explain and overcome androcentrism in Western religion, and it is notable for its playful writing style and its attempt to rehabilitate &quot;God-talk&quot; for the women&#x27;s liberation movement by critically building on the writing of existentialist theologians such as Paul Tillich and Martin Buber. While the former increasingly characterized her writing, she soon abandoned the latter.

In &quot;Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism&quot; (1978), Daly argues that men throughout history have sought to oppress women. In this book she moves beyond her previous thoughts on the history of patriarchy to the focus on the actual practices that, in her view, perpetuate patriarchy, which she calls a religion.

Daly&#x27;s &quot;Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy&quot; (1984) and &quot;Websters&#x27; First New Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language&quot; (1987) introduce and explore an alternative language to explain the process of exorcism and ecstasy. In &quot;Wickedary&quot; Daly provides definitions as well as chants that she says can be used by women to free themselves from patriarchal oppression. She also explores the labels that she says patriarchal society places on women to prolong what she sees as male domination of society. Daly said it is the role of women to unveil the liberatory nature of labels such as &quot;Hag&quot;, &quot;Witch&quot;, and &quot;Lunatic&quot;.

Daly&#x27;s work continues to influence feminism and feminist theology, as well as the developing concept of biophilia as an alternative and challenge to social necrophilia. She was an ethical vegetarian and animal rights activist. &quot;Gyn/Ecology&quot;, &quot;Pure Lust&quot;, and &quot;Websters&#x27; First New Intergalactic Wickedary&quot; all endorse anti-vivisection and anti-fur positions. Daly was a member of the advisory board of Feminists For Animal Rights, a group which is now defunct.

Daly created her own theological anthropology based around the context of what it means to be a woman. She created a thought-praxis that separates the world into the world of false images that create oppression and the world of communion in true being. She labeled these two areas foreground and Background respectively. Daly considered the foreground the realm of patriarchy and the Background the realm of Woman. She argued that the Background is under and behind the surface of the false reality of the foreground. The foreground, for Daly, was a distortion of true being, the paternalistic society in which she said most people live. It has no real energy, but drains the &quot;life energy&quot; of women residing in the Background. In her view, the foreground creates a world of poisons that contaminate natural life. She called the male-centered world of the foreground necrophilic, hating all living things. In contrast, she conceived of the Background as a place where all living things connect.
Daly linked &quot;female energy&quot; or her term gyn/ecology to the essential life-creating condition of the female spirit/body.

According to Lucy Sargisson, &quot;Daly seeks in &quot;Gyn/Ecology&quot; (1987) a true, wild, Woman&#x27;s self, which she perceives to be dormant in women, temporarily pacified by patriarchal systems of domination.&quot;

Audre Lorde expressed concern over &quot;Gyn/Ecology&quot; in an open letter, citing homogenizing tendencies, and a refusal to acknowledge the &quot;herstory and myth&quot; of women of color. The letter, and Daly&#x27;s apparent decision not to publicly respond, greatly affected the reception of Daly&#x27;s work among other feminist theorists, and has been described as a &quot;paradigmatic example of challenges to white feminist theory by feminists of color in the 1980s.&quot;

Daly&#x27;s reply letter to Lorde, dated four and a half months later, was found in 2003 in Lorde&#x27;s files after she died. Daly&#x27;s reply was followed in a week by a meeting with Lorde at which Daly said, among other things, that &quot;Gyn/Ecology&quot; was not a compendium of goddesses but limited to &quot;those goddess myths and symbols that were direct sources of Christian myth,&quot; but whether this was accepted by Lorde was unknown at the time.

=== Papers ===
After her death, Daly&#x27;s papers were contributed to the Sophia Smith Collection of Women&#x27;s History at Smith College.

== Perspectives on Daly&#x27;s work ==
Although Daly described herself as a radical feminist, other theorists such as Alice Echols, Linda Alcoff and Elizabeth V. Spelman situated her thinking in cultural feminism, of which premises are called by Ellen Willis ‚Äúantithetical‚Äù to those of radical feminism.

Julie Kubala states that &quot;Gyn/Ecology&quot;‚Äôs ‚Äúessentialist conception of gender is explicitly transphobic and implicitly racist.‚Äù

Wanda Warren Berry, Purushottama Bilimoria, Debra Campbell, Molly Dragiewicz, Marilyn Frye, Frances Gray, Hayes Hampton, Sarah Lucia Hoagland, Amber L. Katherine, AnaLouise Keating, Anne-Marrie Korte, Maria Lugones, Geraldine Moane, Sheilagh A. Mogford, Renuka Sharma, Laurel C. Schneider, and Marja Suhonen published their considered analyses of Daly&#x27;s works and philosophy in &quot;Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly&quot;, Penn State University Press, 2000.

== Views ==

=== On religion ===
At the beginning of her career, Daly had been a practicing Roman Catholic.

In &quot;The Church and the Second Sex&quot;, Daly argued that religion and equality between women and men are not mutually exclusive. In her early works she sought to change religion and create an equal place for women in Catholicism by calling the church out on injustice and insisting on change. In the course of her writings her view of religion changed. She repudiated the Christian faith and regarded organized religion as inherently oppressive toward women by the time she wrote &quot;Beyond God and Father&quot;, stating that &quot;woman&#x27;s asking for equality in the church would be comparable to a black person&#x27;s demanding equality in the Ku Klux Klan&quot;. In 1975, she characterized herself as a &quot;post-Christian feminist&quot;.

Daly believed God to be an anti-feminist way of thinking. &quot;If God is male then the male is God. How can a feminist worship a male God? The unholy trinity of rape, genocide and war are a result of the patriarchal society&quot;. 

Daly eventually gave up on theology, believing it to be hopelessly patriarchal, and she turned her efforts towards philosophical feminism. She saw the Catholic Church as fundamentally corrupt, but it still had some value to her, as was evidenced by her love for her copy of &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; in her later days. After all, her Catholic upbringing and education as well as her views on the church are what sparked her career and later work. Despite her abandonment of the subject, Daly&#x27;s work opened the door for many more feminist theologians after her. Even when she moved on from the study of religion her ideas remained and inspired many of her contemporaries.

Daly&#x27;s subsequent work was influenced by Wicca, though she rejected the characterization of her theology as being &quot;Wiccan&quot;.

=== On feminism ===
In &quot;Gyn/Ecology&quot; (1978), she criticized the &quot;Equal Rights&quot; feminist framework. Many feminist thinkers consider the choice to use an &quot;equality&quot; lens (also known as an &quot;equity&quot; or &quot;equality&quot; framework) a distinctive mark of politically liberal, rather than politically radical or postmodern, feminisms. Daly&#x27;s argument was that the equality framework serves to distract women from the radical goal of altering or abolishing patriarchy as a whole, directing them instead towards gaining reforms within the existing system. According to Daly, such reforms leave women vulnerable because, though they grant nominal legal equality with men, the larger structures of patriarchy are left intact, and the later repeal of reforms is always possible. She also argued that the &quot;equality&quot; framework de-centers women from feminist thought when it encourages women to assimilate into male-dominated movements or institutions.

=== On men ===
In &quot;The Church and the Second Sex&quot;, Daly argued for the equality between the sexes and stated that the church must acknowledge the importance of equality between men and women. She wrote that women and men were created equal.

In &quot;Gyn&quot;/&quot;Ecology (1978)&quot;, Daly claimed that male culture was the direct, evil opposite of female nature, and that the ultimate purpose of men was death of both women and nature. Daly contrasted women&#x27;s life-giving powers with men&#x27;s death-dealing powers.

In &quot;Beyond God the Father&quot; (1973), she still believed that equality was important but argued more in terms of sexual difference than sexual equality.

In a 1999 interview with &quot;What Is Enlightenment?&quot; magazine, Daly said, &quot;&quot;I don&#x27;t think about men.&quot; I really don&#x27;t care about them. I&#x27;m concerned with &quot;women&#x27;s&quot; capacities, which have been infinitely diminished under patriarchy. Not that they&#x27;ve disappeared, but they&#x27;ve been made subliminal. I&#x27;m concerned with &quot;women&quot; enlarging our capacities, actualizing them. So that takes all my energy.&quot;

Later in the interview when asked about her opinion on Sally Miller Gearhart&#x27;s proposal that &quot;the proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race&quot;, she said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s not a bad idea at all. If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males.&quot;

=== On transgender persons ===

In &quot;Gyn/Ecology,&quot; Daly asserted her view of transgender persons, writing, &quot;Today the Frankenstein phenomenon is omnipresent .¬†.¬†. in .¬†.¬†. phallocratic technology.¬†.¬†.¬†. Transsexualism is an example of male surgical siring which invades the female world with substitutes.&quot; &quot;Transsexualism, which Janice Raymond has shown to be essentially a male problem, is an &quot;attempt&quot; to change males into females, whereas in fact no male can assume female chromosomes and life history/experience.&quot; &quot;The surgeons and hormone therapists of the transsexual kingdom .¬†.¬†. can be said to produce feminine persons. They cannot produce women.&quot;

Daly was the dissertation advisor to Janice Raymond, whose dissertation was published in 1979 as &quot;The Transsexual Empire&quot;.
