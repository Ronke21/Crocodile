<text>Paulo Jorge dos Santos Futre (; born 28 February 1966) is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a left winger.

Widely considered as one of the best players of his generation, after starting his professional career with Sporting CP, he moved to Porto – winning the 1987 European Cup – after which he embarked in an extensive professional career, having represented clubs in Spain, France, Italy, England and Japan, most notably Atlético Madrid. He also appeared for Benfica during four months in 1993, and his later years were blighted by injury problems.

A Portuguese international from the age of 17, Futre earned over 40 caps for his country, representing it at the 1986 World Cup.

==Club career==
===Sporting CP and Porto===
Born in Montijo, Setúbal District, Futre first appeared professionally in 1983–84, as a 17-year-old for Sporting CP, whose youth system he had joined at the age of nine. When he requested a pay raise from president João Rocha, he was turned down and left for Porto after just one season, as veterans Jaime Pacheco and António Sousa moved in the opposite direction as part of the deal.

In the following years, Futre collected two Primeira Liga titles, also helping the northerners to the 1986–87 European Cup, putting on a Player of the match performance in the final against Bayern Munich.

===Atlético Madrid===
After that continental win, Futre was traded to Atlético Madrid in Spain, earning a reported annual salary of €650,000. At the capital club, he quickly rose to fan favourite status, but his physical weakness left him with several knee injuries which tormented his career in the 1990s.

In his fifth season, Futre provided countless assists for striker Manolo who scored 27 goals for the Pichichi Trophy, with him netting in the campaign&#x27;s Copa del Rey, a 2–0 win over rivals Real Madrid. During most of his spell with the &quot;Colchoneros&quot;, he was also team captain.

===Later years and retirement===
In January 1993, Futre moved to Porto and Sporting rivals Benfica, winning a Taça de Portugal in his short stay (and scoring in the final against Boavista in a 5–2 victory), as his injury woes persisted. Afterwards, he signed a one-season contract with Marseille, where he teamed up with countryman Rui Barros. His time in France was largely disappointing, however, once again due to continual injuries, as well as competition from Dragan Stojković in his position, which limited him to only two goals in eight league games.

Halfway through 1993–94, despite being linked with AC Milan, Futre eventually transferred to newly promoted Serie A side Reggiana. On his debut, on 21 November 1993, he scored a memorable individual goal which opened the scoring in a 2–0 win over Cremonese and gave the hosts their first ever win in the top flight; during the second half, however, he suffered a serious injury after an aggressive challenge from Alessandro Pedroni, which kept him out for the rest of the season as his team narrowly avoided relegation.

The following campaign, Futre managed only 12 appearances and netted four times, which were not enough to save Reggiana from relegation. He did move to Milan for 1995–96 but, due to continuing injury troubles as well as competition from other talented offensive, creative players in his position, he only featured once for the Fabio Capello-led team, coming on as a substitute for Roberto Baggio in the final match of the season against Cremonese at the San Siro, which ended 7–1 for the hosts who celebrated the league conquest.
After his time in Italy, Futre agreed to a one-year deal with West Ham United, where he infamously refused to play until he was given squad number 10. Finally, he returned to Atlético Madrid (ten La Liga matches in 1997–98), effectively ending his career with J1 League club Yokohama Flügels; he ranked joint-98th in &quot;World Soccer&quot;&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players of the 20th century, published in December 1999.

==International career==
Futre played 41 times for Portugal in a 12-year span, scoring six goals. His debut came against Finland for the UEFA Euro 1984 qualifiers, on 27 April 1983 – he was only 17 years and 204 days old, breaking a national team record.

Futre was a member of the national team that competed in the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, playing 90 minutes in the 3–1 loss to Morocco in an eventual group-stage exit.

==Style of play==
A highly talented and creative left-footed winger whose playing style initially drew comparisons with Diego Maradona, Futre was known in particular for his explosive acceleration as well as his excellent technical ability. His dribbling skills, pace, agility and quick feet enabled him to be extremely fast with the ball at his feet and allowed him to take on several opponents.

Due to his vision and work-rate, Futre was capable both of creating and scoring goals, and was a versatile player who was also deployed as a second striker and as an attacking midfielder on occasion during his time in Italy. Despite the precocious talent he demonstrated in his youth, he was also prone to injuries which greatly affected his career, leading to increasingly inconsistent performances, a poorer goalscoring rate, and a premature retirement at the age of 32.

==Post-playing career==
Futre worked as director of football at Atlético Madrid from 2000 to 2003, subsequently becoming a real-estate developer in his hometown. In May 2011, he was part of Dias Ferreira&#x27;s team in an unsuccessful run for Sporting&#x27;s presidency.

==Personal life==
Futre&#x27;s younger son, Fábio, was also a footballer. A midfielder, he played for Atlético Madrid&#x27;s youth teams, and was called up for Portugal under-17s. His nephew, Artur Futre, appeared professionally for Alverca, Maia and Aves, without much impact; his older son, Paulo, played in a rock band, &quot;Fr1day&quot;.

Paulo Sr. was also a television presenter, hosting the TVI 24 late night talk show &quot;A Noite do Futrebol&quot;.

<doc id="670798" wikidata="Q3282525" url="?curid=670798" title="The Moon Is Down (album)">
<text>The Moon Is Down is the debut album by the Pompano Beach, Florida rock band Further Seems Forever, released in 2001 by Tooth &amp; Nail Records. It was the band&#x27;s first full-length album. Vocalist Chris Carrabba had already decided to leave the band to focus on his new project, Dashboard Confessional, but joined them in the studio to record the album. Dominguez left the band the following year to start the record label Pop Up Records. The two were replaced by Jason Gleason and Derick Cordoba, respectively, for the band&#x27;s next album &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot;. A music video was filmed for the song &quot;Snowbirds and Townies.&quot;

==Composition==
Musically, the sound of &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; has been described as emo and indie rock with heavier elements. The opening track &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; sees the group worship God for his strength and supporting them when faltering. &quot;Snowbirds and Townies&quot; talks about missing a girl that has been away from some time. &quot;Pictures of Shorelines&quot; talks about a couple forced to stay apart.

==Release==
&quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; was released through Tooth &amp; Nail Records on March 27, 2001, which was promoted with a few shows alongside Thrice. In July 2001, the band appeared at Krazy Fest 4. Following this, the band toured across the US until August; they were supported by Fairweather, River City High, and the Starting Line. Between September and December, the band embarked on a cross-country US tour. They had various supporting acts during different months: The September shows were supported by As Friends Rust, Element 101 and Jameson; the October shows were supported by Ultimate Fakebook and Breaking Pangaea; the November shows were supported by the Juliana Theory, Relient K, and Ace Troubleshooter; and the December shows were supported by Dashboard Confessional, The Rocking Horse Winner, Fairweather, and Seville.

In February 2002, the band went on an east coast tour with Brand New and Recover, before touring with Hot Rod Circuit and Brand New in March and April. Following this, the band performed at Skate and Surf Fest. In July, they appeared on the midwestern dates of the Warped Tour, and in the following month, they toured across Europe. Returning to the US, the band toured until August, with Dynamite Boy, Lost City Angels, and Breaking Pangaea; the trek included an appearances at Furnace Fest and the Round Top Purple Door Music Festival.

Six of the album&#x27;s tracks – the title-track, &quot;Snowbirds and Townies&quot;, &quot;The Bradley&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Project&quot;, &quot;Wearing Thin&quot; and &quot;Pictures of Shorelines&quot;, as well as &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; – later appeared on the group&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Hope This Finds You Well&quot; (2006).

==Reception==

AllMusic reviewer Rick Anderson said it &quot;kind of sneaks up on you&quot;, expecting another emo act with reflective feelings but lacking the attitude to craft a song with structure, until the first chorus comes: &quot;Cathartic, tuneful, [and] soaring&quot;. While the &quot;conceit remains pretty much the same&quot;, he doesn&#x27;t find it &quot;tiresome&quot;. He praised the group&#x27;s &quot;ability to combine relatively dense guitar rock with an edge of experimentalism and a deep undertow of emotional uplift&quot; that is &quot;more than just impressive — it&#x27;s practically inspiring.&quot; &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot; writer James Stafford said there was &quot;intensity&quot; to the band&#x27;s sound, and Carrabba&#x27;s voice &quot;really bring this out.&quot; He called them a &quot;talented&quot; act for &quot;drawing on elements of rock, punk, hardcore&quot; to craft &quot;quite a good melodic rock album.&quot; &quot;Christianity Today&quot; Russ Breimeier said emo&#x27;s &quot; propensity for passion and emotion fits well&quot; with Carrabba&#x27;s lyricism. He complimented the band&#x27;s &quot;solid musicianship&quot;, particularly the &quot;strong, in-your-face&quot; guitar work and &quot;slick, aggressive drumming that assaults your ears like a machine gun.&quot;

&quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot; staff member Sherwin Frias said upon his first listen to the album, it came across as &quot;rather unremarkable&quot;, while noting its &quot;melodic, yet hardly gripping&quot; sound. It is ultimately &quot;a pleasant, yet hardly engaging listen that passes by quickly without much of a fuss.&quot; Nathan T. Birk of &quot;Ink 19&quot; wrote that it had a &quot;time-tested formula for catharsis&quot;, noting the &quot;sing-songy melodies&quot;, the frequent &quot;half-time/down-tempo transitions&quot;, and Carrabba&#x27;s &quot;Geddy Lee-via-Jeremy Enigk elfin yelp that lets you know that, hey, he’s a sensitive guy.&quot; He pondering on the topic of originality: &quot;Hardly, unless your conception of “originality” includes such latter-day emo-casualties&quot; by the likes of Mineral and Boys Life.

&quot;Christianity Today&quot; included the album as an honorable mention on their best Christian albums of the year list. &quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot; ranked it at number 36 on their list of the top 100 Tooth &amp; Nail releases. Mayday Parade covered &quot;New Years Project&quot; for the compilation &quot;Songs That Saved My Life Volume 2&quot; (2019).

<text>&quot;The Lottery in Babylon&quot; (original Spanish: &quot;La lotería en Babilonia&quot;, &quot;The Babylon Lottery&quot;) is a fantasy short story by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. It first appeared in 1941 in the literary magazine &quot;Sur&quot;, and was then included in the 1941 collection &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; (&quot;El jardín de los senderos que se bifurcan&quot;), which in turn became the part one of &quot;Ficciones&quot; (1944). Translated into English by John M. Fein, it was published in Prairie Schooner, Fall 1959, and in &quot;Labyrinths&quot; (New Directions, 1962).

==Plot summary==
The story describes a mythical Babylon in which all activities are dictated by an all-encompassing lottery, which people must live by, and has full control over many&#x27;s lives, a metaphor for the role of chance in one&#x27;s life. Initially, the lottery was run as a lottery would be, with tickets purchased and the winner receiving a monetary reward. Later, punishments and larger monetary rewards were introduced. Further, participation became mandatory for all but the elite. Finally, it simultaneously became so all-encompassing and so secret some whispered &quot;the Company has never existed, and never will,&quot; and some even posited that the question of the existence of the Company was irrelevant, as Babylon &quot;is nothing but an infinite game of chance.&quot;

==Themes==
The story is about the role that chance plays in life, whether occurrences are genuinely deserved or whether all of life is merely based on luck or loss. The story references Zeno&#x27;s paradox by using the lottery as a metaphor for all the possible random occurrences that could occur between any two points in time. As with fate, the Babylonians attempted to gain control of the lottery by whispering in secret places, though the lottery eventually banned this as a liability. The story may be a criticism of the tendency of humans to claim the authority of nature and capitalize on it, as the Company does with chance. The Lottery cannot be challenged, as it is based on the absolute that is chance. As with most Borges stories, there is a bit of humor in this. At one point, a slave steals a lottery ticket that calls for the bearer&#x27;s tongue to be burned off, which is the same penalty as for stealing a lottery ticket. The public then fight over whether the slave should be punished because it is the penalty for stealing or because it is what the ticket decreed.

<text>Quantum Psychology: How Brain Software Programs You &amp; Your World is a book written by science-fiction writer Robert Anton Wilson, originally published in 1990. It deals with what Wilson himself calls &quot;quantum psychology,&quot; which is not a field within academic psychology.

Like Wilson&#x27;s earlier volume &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot;, &quot;Quantum Psychology&quot; features practical exercises to demonstrate its concepts at the end of each chapter (this time intended for groups rather than a lone reader). It focuses primarily on the metaphysical and epistemological problems of Aristotelean reasoning and its use in everyday language, covering E-Prime (Wilson wrote the book in E-Prime) and how it addresses many of the semantic (and resulting perceptual) &quot;spooks&quot; that common language lets in.

It also covers psychosomatic healing and a possible explanation for it; non-local effects in quantum physics (Bell&#x27;s theorem) and the theories of David Bohm; and a brief recap of the Timothy Leary eightfold consciousness theory of human consciousness which &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot; covers in greater detail.

<text>Gerhard Klopfer (18 February 1905 – 29 January 1987) was a lawyer and a senior official in the Nazi Party who, as the State Secretary in the Party Chancellery, was Martin Bormann&#x27;s chief deputy. He was also an SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot;. He participated in the Wannsee Conference that drew up plans for the implementation of the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. He subsequently denied all knowledge of the Holocaust and never was prosecuted.

== Early life and education ==
Klopfer was born the son of a farmer at Schreibersdorf (today, Pisarzowice) in the Prussian Province of Silesia. He attended the local &quot;Gymnasium&quot; and received his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1923. He studied law and economics at the University of Breslau (today, the University of Wrocław) and the University of Jena. After passing his first state legal examination in 1927, he wrote his doctoral dissertation in 1929, received his doctorate of law degree and completed his legal clerkship in Breslau. In 1931, he passed his second state legal examination in Berlin and started working as a junior judge at Düsseldorf.

== Career in Nazi Germany ==
=== Government and Party posts ===
When the Nazis came to power in 1933, he joined the Nazi Party on 1 April (membership number 1,706,842) and the Party&#x27;s paramilitary unit, the Sturmabteilung (SA), shortly afterward. On 1 November 1933, he was named as a state prosecutor in Düsseldorf and, on 1 December, he became a &quot;Referent&quot; (consultant) in the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Forests under Walther Darré. He was promoted to &quot;Regierungsrat&quot; (Government Councilor) in August 1934 and, in December, he joined the Gestapo (Secret State Police). He also became a member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law and served on its Police Law Committee. On 18 April 1935, he joined the staff of Deputy &quot;Führer&quot; Rudolf Hess at the Party headquarters in Munich. As an &quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot; (Senior Government Councilor), he initially headed the Party component overseeing the Reich Interior Ministry. In 1938, he became responsible for the seizing of Jewish businesses in the Aryanization process, for questions about mixed marriages between Gentile and Jewish Germans, and for general questions about occupation of foreign states. By April 1941, he had advanced to the rank of &quot;Ministerialdirektor&quot; and headed Department III that oversaw coordination between the Party and all state components. His field of responsibility included coordinating work with all the ministries and finalizing legislation. He became a close confidant of Martin Bormann who, on 12 May 1941, became head of the Party Chancellery, the successor organization to Hess&#x27; office.

Along with Helmuth Friedrichs, Klopfer was the highest-ranking official under Bormann. This position gave him extensive power of patronage within the Nazi Party, as Bormann often left appointments to party positions to Klopfer and Friedrichs. Klopfer represented Bormann at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, in which the details of the Final Solution of the Jewish Question were formalised, policies that culminated in the Holocaust. On 22 November 1942, Adolf Hitler appointed him to the position of State Secretary of the Party Chancellery. Klopfer was also responsible as signatory for a final call to arms, including the under-aged and the elderly from 16 to 60 years of age, to serve in the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, the Nazi Party militia, during the final months of the Second World War.

=== SS membership ===
In addition to his Party positions, Klopfer was also a member of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). He joined the organization in July 1935 (SS number 272,227) where he first was assigned to the SD Main Office and would later join the Reich Security Main Office. Commissioned as an officer on 15 September 1935, he rose rapidly through the ranks and attained his final promotion to SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; on 9 November 1944.

== Post-war life ==
As the Red Army closed in on Berlin in April 1945, Klopfer fled west from the city. He went into hiding under an assumed name but, on March 1, 1946, he was discovered, arrested and interned in Munich by the Counterintelligence Corps. He testified as a witness at the Ministries Trial in Nuremberg in 1948. He himself was charged with war crimes but denied all knowledge of the Holocaust. The case against him was dropped for lack of evidence and because it was deemed he did not have enough power to have influenced the Nazi policy on the Holocaust.

After his release, Klopfer underwent a denazification process by a German tribunal in March 1949 and was classified as a &quot;minor offender&quot; (category III), receiving a 2000 &quot;Reichsmark&quot; fine and three years probation. He found work as a carpenter until becoming a tax advisor in the city of Ulm in 1952 and was readmitted to the practice of law in 1956. Another investigation into Klopfer&#x27;s participation in the Wannsee Conference that was initiated by the Ulm public prosecutor&#x27;s office in September 1960 was closed on 29 January 1962 on the basis that &quot;there was no way the accused could have prevented or obstructed the implementation of the mass murder program&quot;. When he died in 1987, Klopfer was the last surviving attendee of the Wannsee Conference. When he died, his family published a death notice that celebrated &quot;a fulfilled life that was to the benefit of all those who came under his sphere of influence&quot;. This caused a public outcry and was denounced by many as an insult to all victims of the Nazi regime.

== Fictional portrayals ==
Klopfer was portrayed by in the German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; (1984), by Ian McNeice in the BBC/HBO film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2001) and by Fabian Busch in the German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; (2022).

<text>Jasmonate (JA) and its derivatives are lipid-based plant hormones that regulate a wide range of processes in plants, ranging from growth and photosynthesis to reproductive development. In particular, JAs are critical for plant defense against herbivory and plant responses to poor environmental conditions and other kinds of abiotic and biotic challenges. Some JAs can also be released as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to permit communication between plants in anticipation of mutual dangers.

==History==

The isolation of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) from jasmine oil derived from &quot;Jasminum grandiflorum&quot; led to the discovery of the molecular structure of jasmonates and their name in 1962 while jasmonic acid itself was isolated from &quot;Lasiodiplodia theobromae&quot; by Alderidge et al in 1971.

== Biosynthesis ==
Biosynthesis is reviewed by Acosta and Farmer 2010, Wasternack and Hause 2013, and Wasternack and Song 2017. Jasmonates (JA) are oxylipins, i.e. derivatives of oxygenated fatty acid. They are biosynthesized from linolenic acid in chloroplast membranes. Synthesis is initiated with the conversion of linolenic acid to 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), which then undergoes a reduction and three rounds of oxidation to form (+)-7-iso-JA, jasmonic acid. Only the conversion of linolenic acid to OPDA occurs in the chloroplast; all subsequent reactions occur in the peroxisome.

JA itself can be further metabolized into active or inactive derivatives. Methyl JA (MeJA) is a volatile compound that is potentially responsible for interplant communication. JA conjugated with amino acid isoleucine (Ile) results in JA-Ile ((+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl--isoleucine), which Fonseca et al 2009 finds is involved in most JA signaling - see also the review by Katsir et al 2008. However Van Poecke &amp; Dicke 2003 finds &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;″s emission of volatiles to not require JA-Ile, nor VanDoorn et al 2011 for &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot;″s herbivore resistance. JA undergoes decarboxylation to give cis-jasmone.

== Function ==
Although jasmonate (JA) regulates many different processes in the plant, its role in wound response is best understood. Following mechanical wounding or herbivory, JA biosynthesis is rapidly activated, leading to expression of the appropriate response genes. For example, in the tomato, wounding produces defense molecules that inhibit leaf digestion in guts of insects. Another indirect result of JA signaling is the volatile emission of JA-derived compounds. MeJA on leaves can travel airborne to nearby plants and elevate levels of transcripts related to wound response. In general, this emission can further upregulate JA biosynthesis and cell signaling, thereby inducing nearby plants to prime their defenses in case of herbivory.

JAs have also been implicated in cell death and leaf senescence. JA can interact with many kinases and transcription factors associated with senescence. JA can also induce mitochondrial death by inducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). These compounds disrupt mitochondria membranes and compromise the cell by causing apoptosis, or programmed cell death. JAs&#x27; roles in these processes are suggestive of methods by which the plant defends itself against biotic challenges and limits the spread of infections.

JA and its derivatives have also been implicated in plant development, symbiosis, and a host of other processes included in the list below.
*By studying mutants overexpressing JA, one of the earliest discoveries made was that JA inhibits root growth. The mechanism behind this event is still not understood, but mutants in the COI1-dependent signaling pathway tend to show reduced inhibition, demonstrating that the COI1 pathway is somehow necessary for inhibiting root growth.
*JA plays many roles in flower development. Mutants in JA synthesis or in JA signaling in Arabidopsis present with male sterility, typically due to delayed development. The same genes promoting male fertility in Arabidopsis promote female fertility in tomatoes. Overexpression of 12-OH-JA can also delay flowering.
*JA and MeJA inhibit the germination of nondormant seeds and stimulate the germination of dormant seeds.
*High levels of JA encourage the accumulation of storage proteins; genes encoding vegetative storage proteins are JA responsive. Specifically, tuberonic acid, a JA derivative, induces the formation of tubers.
*JAs also play a role in symbiosis between plants and microorganisms; however, its precise role is still unclear. JA currently appears to regulate signal exchange and nodulation regulation between legumes and rhizobium. On the other hand, elevated JA levels appear to regulate carbohydrate partitioning and stress tolerance in mycorrhizal plants.

* JAs have been implicated in the development of carnivorous plants such as the Venus flytrap. Research suggests that evolutionary repurposing of the jasmonate signaling pathway, which mediates defense against herbivores in noncarnivorous plants, has supported the evolution of plant carnivory. Jasmonates can be used to signal the closing of traps and to control the release of enzymes and nutrient transporters which are used in plant digestion. However, not all carnivorous plants rely on the jasmonate pathway in the same way. Butterworts differ significantly from Venus flytraps and sundews, and may have developed methods of regulating digestive enzymes that are JA-independent.

=== Role in pathogenesis ===
&quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; causes bacterial speck disease in tomatoes by hijacking the plant&#x27;s jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway. This bacteria utilizes a type III secretion system to inject a cocktail of viral effector proteins into host cells.

One of the molecules included in this mixture is the phytotoxin coronatine (COR). JA-insensitive plants are highly resistant to &quot;P. syringae&quot; and unresponsive to COR; additionally, applying MeJA was sufficient to rescue virulence in COR mutant bacteria. Infected plants also expressed downstream JA and wound response genes but repressed levels of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. All these data suggest COR acts through the JA pathway to invade host plants. Activation of a wound response is hypothesized to come at the expense of pathogen defense. By activating the JA wound response pathway, &quot;P. syringae&quot; could divert resources from its host&#x27;s immune system and infect more effectively.

Plants produce N-acylamides that confer resistance to necrotrophic pathogens by activating JA biosynthesis and signalling. Arachidonic acid (AA), the counterpart of the JA precursor α-LeA occurring in metazoan species but not in plants, is perceived by plants and acts through an increase in JA levels concomitantly with resistance to necrotrophic pathogens. AA is an evolutionarily conserved signalling molecule that acts in plants in response to stress similar to that in animal systems.

=== Cross talk with other defense pathways ===
While the jasmonate (JA) pathway is critical for wound response, it is not the only signaling pathway mediating defense in plants. To build an optimal yet efficient defense, the different defense pathways must be capable of cross talk to fine-tune and specify responses to abiotic and biotic challenges.

One of the best studied examples of JA cross talk occurs with salicylic acid (SA). SA, a hormone, mediates defense against pathogens by inducing both the expression of pathogenesis-related genes and systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in which the whole plant gains resistance to a pathogen after localized exposure to it.

Wound and pathogen response appear to be interact negatively. For example, silencing phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), an enzyme synthesizing precursors to SA, reduces SAR but enhances herbivory resistance against insects. Similarly, overexpression of PAL enhances SAR but reduces wound response after insect herbivory. Generally, it has been found that pathogens living in live plant cells are more sensitive to SA-induced defenses, while herbivorous insects and pathogens that derive benefit from cell death are more susceptible to JA defenses. Thus, this trade-off in pathways optimizes defense and saves plant resources.

Cross talk also occurs between JA and other plant hormone pathways, such as those of abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene (ET). These interactions similarly optimize defense against pathogens and herbivores of different lifestyles. For example, MYC2 activity can be stimulated by both JA and ABA pathways, allowing it to integrate signals from both pathways. Other transcription factors such as ERF1 arise as a result of JA and ET signaling. All these molecules can act in combination to activate specific wound response genes.

Finally, cross talk is not restricted for defense: JA and ET interactions are critical in development as well, and a balance between the two compounds is necessary for proper apical hook development in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; seedlings. Still, further research is needed to elucidate the molecules regulating such cross talk.

== Mechanism of signaling ==

In general, the steps in jasmonate (JA) signaling mirror that of auxin signaling: the first step comprises E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which tag substrates with ubiquitin to mark them for degradation by proteasomes. The second step utilizes transcription factors to effect physiological changes. One of the key molecules in this pathway is JAZ, which serves as the on-off switch for JA signaling. In the absence of JA, JAZ proteins bind to downstream transcription factors and limit their activity. However, in the presence of JA or its bioactive derivatives, JAZ proteins are degraded, freeing transcription factors for expression of genes needed in stress responses.

Because JAZ did not disappear in null &quot;coi1&quot; mutant plant backgrounds, protein COI1 was shown to mediate JAZ degradation. COI1 belongs to the family of highly conserved F-box proteins, and it recruits substrates for the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFCOI1. The complexes that ultimately form are known as SCF complexes. These complexes bind JAZ and target it for proteasomal degradation. However, given the large spectrum of JA molecules, not all JA derivatives activate this pathway for signaling, and the range of those participating in this pathway is unknown. Thus far, only JA-Ile has been shown to be necessary for COI1-mediated degradation of JAZ11. JA-Ile and structurally related derivatives can bind to COI1-JAZ complexes and promote ubiquitination and thus degradation of the latter.

This mechanistic model raises the possibility that COI1 serves as an intracellular receptor for JA signals. Recent research has confirmed this hypothesis by demonstrating that the COI1-JAZ complex acts as a co-receptor for JA perception. Specifically, JA-Ile binds both to a ligand-binding pocket in COI1 and to a 20 amino-acid stretch of the conserved Jas motif in JAZ. This JAZ residue acts as a plug for the pocket in COI1, keeping JA-Ile bound in the pocket. Additionally, Sheard et al 2010 co-purified and subsequently removed inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5) from COI1, demonstrating InsP5 to be a necessary component of the co-receptor and playing a role in potentiating the co-receptor complex. Sheard&#x27;s results may show varying binding specificity for various SCF-InsP-JAZ complexes.

Once freed from JAZ, transcription factors can activate genes needed for a specific JA response. The best-studied transcription factors acting in this pathway belong to the MYC family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA binding motif. These factors (of which there are three, MYC2, 3, and 4) tend to act additively. For example, a plant that has only lost one myc becomes more susceptible to insect herbivory than a normal plant. A plant that has lost all three will be as susceptible to damage as coi1 mutants, which are completely unresponsive to JA and cannot mount a defense against herbivory. However, while all these MYC molecules share functions, they vary greatly in expression patterns and transcription functions. For instance, MYC2 has a greater effect on root growth compared to MYC3 or MYC4.

Additionally, MYC2 will loop back and regulate JAZ expression levels, leading to a negative feedback loop. These transcription factors all have different impacts on JAZ levels after JA signaling. JAZ levels in turn affect transcription factor and gene expression levels. In other words, on top of activating different response genes, the transcription factors can vary JAZ levels to achieve specificity in response to JA signals.

<text>Brassinosteroids (BRs or less commonly BS) are a class of polyhydroxysteroids that have been recognized as a sixth class of
plant hormones and may have utility as anticancer drugs for treating endocrine-responsive cancers by inducing apoptosis of cancer cells and inhibiting cancerous growth. These brassinosteroids were first explored during the 1970s when Mitchell et al. reported promotion in stem elongation and cell division by the treatment of organic extracts of rapeseed (&quot;Brassica napus&quot;) pollen. Brassinolide was the first brassinosteroid to be isolated in 1979, when pollen from &quot;Brassica napus&quot; was shown to promote stem elongation and cell divisions, and the biologically active molecule was isolated.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/281216a0&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The yield of brassinosteroids from 230 kg of &quot;Brassica napus&quot; pollen was only 10 mg. Since their discovery, over 70 BR compounds have been isolated from plants.

==Biosynthesis==

The BR is biosynthesised from campesterol. The biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by Japanese researchers and later shown to be correct through the analysis of BR biosynthesis mutants in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, tomatoes, and peas. The sites for BR synthesis in plants have not been experimentally demonstrated. One well-supported hypothesis is that all tissues produce BRs, since BR biosynthetic and signal transduction genes are expressed in a wide range of plant organs, and short distance activity of the hormones also supports this. Experiments have shown that long distance transport is possible and that the flow is from the base to the tips (acropetal), but it is not known if this movement is biologically relevant.

==Functions==

BRs have been shown to be involved in numerous plant processes:
*Promotion of cell expansion and cell elongation; work with auxins to do so.
*It has an unclear role in cell division and cell wall regeneration.
*Promotion of vascular differentiation; BR signal transduction has been studied during vascular differentiation.
*Is necessary for pollen elongation for pollen tube formation.
*Acceleration of senescence in dying tissue cultured cells; delayed senescence in BR mutants supports that this action may be biologically relevant.
*Can provide some protection to plants during chilling and drought stress.

Extract from the plant &quot;Lychnis viscaria&quot; contains a relatively high amount of Brassinosteroids. &quot;Lychnis viscaria&quot; increases the disease resistance of surrounding plants.

24-Epibrassinolide (EBL), a brassinosteroid isolated from &quot;Aegle marmelos&quot; Correa (Rutaceae), was further evaluated for the antigenotoxicity against maleic hydrazide (MH)-induced genotoxicity in &quot;Allium cepa&quot; chromosomal aberration assay. It was shown that the percentage of chromosomal aberrations induced by maleic hydrazide (0.01%) declined significantly with 24-epibrassinolide treatment.

BRs have been reported to counteract both abiotic and biotic stress in plants. Application of brassinosteroids to cucumbers was demonstrated to increase the metabolism and removal of pesticides, which could be beneficial for reducing the human ingestion of residual pesticides from non-organically grown vegetables.

BRs have also been reported to have a variety of effects when applied to rice seeds (Oryza sativa L.). Seeds treated with BRs were shown to reduce the growth inhibitory effect of salt stress. When the developed plants fresh weight was analyzed the treated seeds outperformed plants grown on saline and non-saline medium however when the dry weight was analyzed BR treated seeds only outperformed untreated plants that were grown on saline medium. When dealing with tomatoes (&quot;Lycopersicon esculentum&quot;) under salt stress the concentration of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were decreased and thus pigmentation was decreased as well. BR treated rice seeds considerably restored the pigment level in plants that were grown on saline medium when compared to non-treated plants under the same conditions.

== Signalling mechanism ==

BRs are perceived at the cell membrane by a co-receptor complex, comprising brassinosteroid insensitive-1 (BRI1) and BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1). BRI1 acts as a kinase, but in the absence of BR its action is inhibited by another protein, BRI1 kinase inhibitor 1 (BKI1). When BR binds to the BRI1:BAK1 complex, BKI1 is released, and a phosphorylation cascade is triggered which results in the de-activation of another kinase, brassinosteroid insensitive 2 (BIN2). BIN2 and its close homologues inhibit several transcription factors. The inhibition of BIN2 by BR releases these transcription factors to bind to DNA and to enact certain developmental pathways.

==Agricultural uses==

BR might reveal to have a prominent interest in the role of horticultural crops. Based on extensive research BR has the ability to improve the quantity and quality of horticultural crops and protect plants against many stresses that can be present in the local environment. With the many advances in technology dealing with the synthesis of more stable synthetic analogues and the genetic manipulation of cellular BR activity, using BR in the production of horticultural crops has become a more practical and hopeful strategy for improving crop yields and success. The application of BR successfully alleviate drought stress and improve wheat growth under deficit irrigation system. It had further positive impacts on increasing plant growth parameters via their integral role in decreasing oxidative stress indicators.

BR application has demonstrated efficacy against &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;, mildew on cucumber, viral diseases, and various others.

BR could also help bridge the gap of the consumers&#x27; health concerns and the producers need for growth. A major benefit of using BR is that it does not interfere with the environment because they act in a natural way. Since it is a “plant strengthening substance” and it is natural, BR application would be more favorable than pesticides and does not contribute to the co-evolution of pests.

In Germany, extract from the plant is allowed for use as a &quot;plant strengthening substance.&quot;
There are some bioassays that can detect BRs in the plant such as the bean second internode elongation assay and the rice leaf lamina inclination test.

<doc id="670856" wikidata="Q332211" url="?curid=670856" title="Abscisic acid">
<text>Abscisic acid (ABA or abscisin II) is a plant hormone. ABA functions in many plant developmental processes, including seed and bud dormancy, the control of organ size and stomatal closure. It is especially important for plants in the response to environmental stresses, including drought, soil salinity, cold tolerance, freezing tolerance, heat stress and heavy metal ion tolerance.

==Discovery==
In the 1940s, Torsten Hemberg, while working at the University of Stockholm, found evidence that a positive correlation exists between the rest period and the occurrence of an acidic ether soluble growth inhibitor in potato tubers.

In 1963, abscisic acid was first identified and characterized as a plant hormone by Frederick T. Addicott and Larry A. Davis. They were studying compounds that cause abscission (shedding) of cotton fruits (bolls). Two compounds were isolated and called abscisin I and abscisin II. Abscisin II is presently called abscisic acid (ABA).

==In plants==

===Function ===
ABA was originally believed to be involved in abscission, which is how it received its name. This is now known to be the case only in a small number of plants. ABA-mediated signaling also plays an important part in plant responses to environmental stress and plant pathogens. The plant genes for ABA biosynthesis and sequence of the pathway have been elucidated. ABA is also produced by some plant pathogenic fungi via a biosynthetic route different from ABA biosynthesis in plants.

In preparation for winter, ABA is produced in terminal buds. This slows plant growth and directs leaf primordia to develop scales to protect the dormant buds during the cold season. ABA also inhibits the division of cells in the vascular cambium, adjusting to cold conditions in the winter by suspending primary and secondary growth.

Abscisic acid is also produced in the roots in response to decreased soil water potential (which is associated with dry soil) and other situations in which the plant may be under stress. ABA then translocates to the leaves, where it rapidly alters the osmotic potential of stomatal guard cells, causing them to shrink and stomata to close. The ABA-induced stomatal closure reduces transpiration (evaporation of water out of the stomata), thus preventing further water loss from the leaves in times of low water availability. A close linear correlation was found between the ABA content of the leaves and their conductance (stomatal resistance) on a leaf area basis.

Seed germination is inhibited by ABA in antagonism with gibberellin. ABA also prevents loss of seed dormancy.

Several ABA-mutant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; plants have been identified and are available from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre - both those deficient in ABA production and those with altered sensitivity to its action. Plants that are hypersensitive or insensitive to ABA show phenotypes in seed dormancy, germination, stomatal regulation, and some mutants show stunted growth and brown/yellow leaves. These mutants reflect the importance of ABA in seed germination and early embryo development.

Pyrabactin (a pyridyl containing ABA activator) is a naphthalene sulfonamide hypocotyl cell expansion inhibitor, which is an agonist of the seed ABA signaling pathway. It is the first agonist of the ABA pathway that is not structurally related to ABA.

===Homeostasis ===

====Biosynthesis====

Abscisic acid (ABA) is an isoprenoid plant hormone, which is synthesized in the plastidal 2-&quot;C&quot;-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway; unlike the structurally related sesquiterpenes, which are formed from the mevalonic acid-derived precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), the C15 backbone of ABA is formed after cleavage of C40 carotenoids in MEP. Zeaxanthin is the first committed ABA precursor; a series of enzyme-catalyzed epoxidations and isomerizations via violaxanthin, and final cleavage of the C40 carotenoid by a dioxygenation reaction yields the proximal ABA precursor, xanthoxin, which is then further oxidized to ABA. via abscisic aldehyde.

Abamine has been designed, synthesized, developed and then patented as the first specific ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, which makes it possible to regulate endogenous levels of ABA.

====Locations and timing of ABA biosynthesis====
* Synthesized in nearly all plant tissues, e.g., roots, flowers, leaves and stems
* Stored in mesophyll (chlorenchyma) cells where it is conjugated to glucose via uridine diphosphate-glucosyltransferase resulting in the inactivated form, ABA-glucose-ester 
* Activated and released from the chlorenchyma in response to environmental stress, such as heat stress, water stress, salt stress 
* Released during desiccation of the vegetative tissues and when roots encounter soil compaction.
* Synthesized in green fruits at the beginning of the winter period
* Synthesized in maturing seeds, establishing dormancy
* Mobile within the leaf and can be rapidly translocated from the leaves to the roots (opposite of previous belief) in the phloem
* Accumulation in the roots modifies lateral root development, improving the stress response
* ABA is synthesized in almost all cells that contain chloroplasts or amyloplasts

====Inactivation====
ABA can be catabolized to phaseic acid via CYP707A (a group of P450 enzymes) or inactivated by glucose conjugation (ABA-glucose ester) via the enzyme uridine diphosphate-glucosyltransferase (UDP-glucosyltransferase). Catabolism via the CYP707As is very important for ABA homeostasis, and mutants in those genes generally accumulate higher levels of ABA than lines overexpressing ABA biosynthetic genes. In soil bacteria, an alternative catabolic pathway leading to dehydrovomifoliol via the enzyme vomifoliol dehydrogenase has been reported.

===Effects ===
*Antitranspirant - Induces stomatal closure, decreasing transpiration to prevent water loss.
* Promotes root growth during periods of low humidity.
* Inhibits fruit ripening
* Responsible for seed dormancy by inhibiting cell growth – inhibits seed germination
* Inhibits the synthesis of Kinetin nucleotide
* Downregulates enzymes needed for photosynthesis.
* Acts on endodermis to prevent growth of roots when exposed to salty conditions
* Promotion of plant antiviral immunity

=== Signal cascade ===

In the absence of ABA, the phosphatase ABA-INSENSITIVE1 (ABI1) inhibits the action of SNF1-related protein kinases (subfamily 2) (SnRK2s). ABA is perceived by the PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1 (PYR1) and PYR1-like membrane proteins. On ABA binding, PYR1 binds to and inhibits ABI1. When SnRK2s are released from inhibition, they activate several transcription factors from the ABA RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING FACTOR (ABF) family. ABFs then go on to cause changes in the expression of a large number of genes. Around 10% of plant genes are thought to be regulated by ABA.

==In fungi==
Like plants, some fungal species (for example &quot;Cercospora rosicola&quot;, &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; and &quot;Magnaporthe oryzae&quot;) have an endogenous biosynthesis pathway for ABA. In fungi, it seems to be the MVA biosynthetic pathway that is predominant (rather than the MEP pathway that is responsible for ABA biosynthesis in plants). One role of ABA produced by these pathogens seems to be to suppress the plant immune responses.

==In animals==

ABA has also been found to be present in metazoans, from sponges up to mammals including humans. Currently, its biosynthesis and biological role in animals is poorly known. ABA elicits potent anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic effects in mouse models of diabetes/obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis and influenza infection. Many biological effects in animals have been studied using ABA as a nutraceutical or pharmacognostic drug, but ABA is also generated endogenously by some cells (like macrophages) when stimulated. There are also conflicting conclusions from different studies, where some claim that ABA is essential for pro-inflammatory responses whereas other show anti-inflammatory effects. Like with many natural substances with medical properties, ABA has become popular also in naturopathy. While ABA clearly has beneficial biological activities and many naturopathic remedies will contain high levels of ABA (such as wheatgrass juice, fruits and vegetables), some of the health claims made may be exaggerated or overly optimistic. In mammalian cells ABA targets a protein known as lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2), triggering an alternative mechanism of activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). LANCL2 is conserved in plants and was originally suggested to be an ABA receptor also in plants, which was later challenged.

== Measurement of ABA concentration ==

Several methods can help to quantify the concentration of abscisic acid in a variety of plant tissue. The quantitative methods used are based on HPLC and ELISA. Two independent FRET probes can measure intracellular ABA concentrations in real time in vivo.

<doc id="670865" wikidata="Q1280360" url="?curid=670865" title="The Juliana Theory">
<text>The Juliana Theory is an American emo and rock duo from Greensburg and Latrobe, Pennsylvania. They signed to Tooth &amp; Nail Records, and later to Epic Records for the release of the album &quot;Love&quot;. They released four studio albums before initially disbanding in 2006. The band has since reunited three times: once in 2010 for eight shows, again in 2017 for a tour celebrating their 20th anniversary, and finally in 2020 when The Juliana Theory announced signing with Equal Vision Records.

The Juliana Theory has cited numerous bands as influences, including the Beatles, the Cure, the Smashing Pumpkins, U2, Rush, Roger Waters, and Pink Floyd.

==History==
===Formation===
The Juliana Theory was formed in 1997 by Joshua Fiedler and Neil Hebrank (formerly of the band Noisome) along with Chad Monticue (former singer for Pensive), Jeremiah Momper, and Brett Detar (who also split his time as a guitarist for Zao and Pensive at the time).

Detar and Monticue were childhood friends while Fiedler met Detar as classmates at a nearby high school. The members formed The Juliana Theory in 1997 as a side-project while they played in other bands. &quot;We really started out as a joke,&quot; recalls Detar. &quot;Slowly, we started to like the music we were making in The Juliana Theory more than the music we were making in our regular bands. Eventually, everyone committed to make this their full-time band&quot;.

According to an interview on the website Tapout Zine, there was never a real concept behind the band&#x27;s name. &quot;We used to have an elaborate story that we told involving sociology students and a huge experiment involving music and people&#x27;s responses to it, but we got tired of telling the story. The band was supposed to be a side project that wouldn&#x27;t last and we just came up with a name before our first show. It has no meaning at all&quot;. In an interview lead singer Brett Detar told Lina Lecaro of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the band&#x27;s name was &quot;pretty stupid,&quot; adding, &quot;Let&#x27;s just say this: Every band has a name and for better or worse, this is ours&quot;.

Their first performance was at a concert at Saint Vincent College booked by Christopher Pecoraro, as an opening act, but their fame grew quickly. They were spotted by Brandon Ebel of Tooth &amp; Nail Records on the Cornerstone Music Festival impromptu stage, which showcased unsigned talent. A split EP with the band Dawson High on Arise Records marked the band&#x27;s recorded debut. Shortly after The Juliana Theory signed a multi-album deal with Seattle-based Tooth &amp; Nail records.

===The Tooth &amp; Nail Era===
After spending time on the road touring, the band signed with the independent record label Tooth &amp; Nail. The label released The Juliana Theory&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Understand This Is a Dream&quot; on March 23, 1999. Around this time Joshua Kosker, originally of the group Dawson High, replaced Momper when he left the band after the band&#x27;s first album was released. The following year The Juliana Theory and Tooth &amp; Nail released the follow-up record &quot;Emotion Is Dead&quot; (2000). Together, the albums sold around 130,000 units.

After the release of &quot;Emotion Is Dead&quot;, Tooth &amp; Nail and The Juliana Theory clashed heads in terms of creative and promotional areas of the group&#x27;s marketing. &quot;Most things that we asked them to do for us they couldn&#x27;t do or didn&#x27;t do. Now, almost everything we asked for at the time is just protocol for the label. They do all of the stuff we wanted them to do back then very well now.&quot; The group left to find a new label shortly afterwards.

===The Epic Era===
In 2001, the Juliana Theory signed a recording contract with Epic/Sony. Dates on the 2001 Warped Tour followed. On October 23, 2001, The Juliana Theory released six new songs as the &quot;Music from Another Room&quot; EP on Tooth &amp; Nail Records.

A change in the line up meant that original drummer Neil Hebrank was replaced by Josh &quot;Chip&quot; Walters before the recording of &quot;Love&quot;, the band&#x27;s third-full-length album for Epic Records.

Recorded at locations in California and also at lead singer Brett&#x27;s home Studio at Greensburg, Pennsylvania, &quot;Love&quot; was produced by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads who also worked with successful acts Live and No Doubt. Love sold over 100,000 albums with little radio or label support behind it. This led to over 260 tour dates the year of its release and the record debuted on Billboard 200 chart at No. 71 and remained in the top 200 for 5 weeks.

Around the time of the release of &quot;Love&quot;, the band co-headlined a tour with Something Corporate for tour dates which included New York, Los Angeles and many cities in between. Between January and March 2003 both the Juliana Theory and Something Corporate shared the stage, along with support act Vendetta Red all three groups had moved from independent to major record labels since the release of their previous records.

In a 2003 interview Brett Detar shared his thoughts about the group&#x27;s time with Sony. &quot;It&#x27;s not nearly as good as we had hoped,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;ve never really had a great time at any record label we&#x27;ve been at&quot;.

The band soon parted ways with Epic Records after the release of the &quot;Love&quot; album and signed a deal with Rykodisc. In a MySpace blog written by Detar, he explains that after a change in management and direction of the label, &quot;...at the last second we wormed our way out of the deal and headed into the studio with our own funds and with the help of Josh Karchmer, our manager.&quot;

===Paper Fist Era===
Following the separation of the group from Epic Records the band subsequently began their own label affiliated with Abacus Recordings called Paper Fist (in reference to The Juliana Theory song, &quot;To the Tune of 5,000 Screaming Children&quot;). Their fourth studio album &quot;Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat&quot; was released on September 13, 2005.

&quot;Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat&quot; was produced and recorded by John Travis and was co-produced by frontman Brett Detar. The album was recorded at Seedy Underbelly Studios, Valley Village California between November and December 2004 and also at Studio 66 in Greensburg, Pennsylvania between the months of December 2004 and January 2005.

The limited edition release of &quot;Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat&quot; features a 25-minute making of documentary filmed by the band, Jeff Calhoun and Jason Hopkins. In the documentary Brett shared that around 30 pieces of music and 25 complete songs were made in preparation of the finished record.

In the documentary the band claim that the record is driven by the four songs, four pillars which hold the rest of record, the songs they specify include: &quot;This Is a Lovesong... For the Loveless&quot;, &quot;This Valentine Aint&#x27; No Saint&quot;, &quot;French Kiss Off&quot; and &quot;Shotgun Serenade&quot;. The DVD also features four previously unreleased exclusive tracks only available with the limited edition set.

Chad shares in regard to the album &quot;I can honestly say we made a record about love, cars, drinking, and drugs and sex and murder, all those things are elements of our record and I think that&#x27;s pretty cool, what else do you want to listen to?, there&#x27;s nothing better to listen to&quot;. Brett also shares that the record benefits from having &quot;bite and venom&quot; and that &quot;the album lyrically packs a lot more punch&quot;.

===Breakup===
On February 9, 2006, the band announced they were breaking up. Reasons cited for the group&#x27;s disbandment include issues with record labels Tooth and Nail and Epic.

===Post-breakup===
An official MySpace blog posted on February 8, 2007, gave an update on Josh Fiedler starting new band Vesta and Josh &quot;Chip&quot; Walters playing drums in his new band called Crushing Ground.

An August 16, 2009, Drive By Media story teased that The Juliana Theory may be reforming after comments left by the official Juliana Theory Twitter page suggested &quot;good things are coming. we promise&quot;.

On October 5, 2009, former lead singer Brett Detar posted an announcement on his official website that a Juliana Theory Rarities &amp; B-Sides Album was in the works and will be available sometime in the near future.

===Vesta===
In 2008 The Juliana Theory members Joshua Fiedler, Joshua Kosker and Chad Alan began writing and recording music with a new band called Vesta. The group played their first show on April 25, 2009, in Bowling Green, Ohio.
Around this time the group was working on their first album. The recording was done by Pittsburgh musician and recording engineer, Jonathan Gunnell.

On October 6, 2009, Vesta, released their debut EP independently called &quot;0.1 Daylight&#x27;s Coming&quot;. Once again Gunnell recorded and mixed the release, but mastering was completed by Garrett Haines at Treelady Studios. In 2010, two additional songs were added and the album was released by Paper Fist Recordings.

===Reunion===
On December 14, 2009, the band announced that they will be playing 2 reunion shows in the summer of 2010 to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the release of &quot;Emotion Is Dead&quot;. They plan on playing the entire record, in order, as well as a selection of other fan favorites.

A Facebook update on January 20, 2010, gave the seven final tour dates that the band would be playing.

On January 25, 2010, a NYC show was announced at Highline Ballroom for Friday, August 20, 2010. The band played &quot;Emotion Is Dead&quot; as well as a greatest hits set.

On March 23, 2010, Mightier Than Sword Records released &quot;Understand This Is a Dream&quot; on vinyl as the second installment in their 10th Anniversary Series.

In August 2010, the band released a 28-song B-sides and Rarities album for online purchase only. The album was mastered by Jonathan Gunnell who had been working with Vesta on their debut release.

On Saturday September 11, 2010, the band said one final goodnight at The Altar Bar (since closed) in Pittsburgh where they donated all of the ticket sales to the Mario Lemieux Foundation.

On August 19, 2016, American record label Mind Over Matter Records re-issued &quot;Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat&quot; as a double LP with four bonus tracks.

On April 17, 2017, the band announced a North American summer reunion tour, celebrating their 20th anniversary. The tour also included the Vans Warped Rewind at Sea, sailing from New Orleans to Cozumel October 28 through November 1, 2017.

===Equal Vision Records Era===
On November 20, 2020, the band announced they had signed with Equal Vision Records and released new single &quot;Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;.

On January 1, 2021, The Juliana Theory released a new track titled &quot;Better Now&quot;, which premiered on YouTube.

They released their first album since 2005, &quot;A Dream Away&quot;, on March 26, 2021, via Rude/Equal Vision Records, which included &quot;Better Now&quot; as well as re-imagined versions of several earlier hits including &quot;Into the Dark&quot; and &quot;If I Told You This Was Killing Me, Would You Stop?&quot;.

In the summer of 2022, The Juliana Theory played select dates on Dashboard Confessional and Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness&#x27;s Hello Gone Days tour.

<text>Aras Habib was a colonel in the Free Iraqi Fighters and the long-term director of intelligence for Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress (INC). He may have been the man in charge of the INC’s quest to hunt down former high-level Ba’athists in Iraq, using Ba&#x27;athist Party archives they had seized; in this area information relayed to US-led forces proved far more reliable than the inferences of weapons of mass destruction that had lured the US into Iraq. Chalabi&#x27;s Pentagon connection, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, decided to close off funding following emerging disclosures that some of Chalabi&#x27;s INC aides supplied sensitive information about U.S. security operations in Baghdad to the Iranian government.

After the US Pentagon&#x27;s public break with Chalabi surface, a warrant for Aras Habib&#x27;s arrest was released but not executed. He remains at large.

<doc id="670880" wikidata="Q2963588" url="?curid=670880" title="Childers, Queensland">
<text>Childers is a rural town and locality in the Bundaberg Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Childers had a population of 1,682 people.

== Geography ==
Childers is in the Wide Bay–Burnett region of Queensland, Australia, situated on the Bruce Highway and lies north of the state capital Brisbane and south-west of Bundaberg. The Isis Highway runs south from the Bruce Highway in Childers.

== History ==
The Childers area is traditionally inhabited by the Dundabarra/burra group (red soil tribe) who are large collective group of the Kabi Kabi nations in the northernmost area of the Wide Bay Burnett. Their descendants still live in the region.

Europeans first arrived in the area in the 1850s. Pastoralists established properties soon after to raise cattle on the fertile lands. Back then, sugar was (as it is now) the key crop grown in the Isis.

The town was established in 1885. The Isis railway line to Childers opened in 1887 and was pivotal in the early development of the area. Childers Post Office opened on 14 November 1887. The town is reportedly named after Hugh Childers, British statesman, who was the Auditor-General of Victoria in the 1850s.

Circa 1888–1889, an Anglican church was erected in Childers. The present Christ Church Anglican was opened and dedicated on 9 May 1901.

The Childers Uniting Church was originally constructed as the Methodist Church in Horton in 1886. Due to the decline of the Horton township the church was subsequently moved to Childers.

<text>Gruppenführer (, ) was an early paramilitary rank of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), first created in 1925 as a senior rank of the SA. Since then, the term &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; is also used for leaders of groups/teams of the police, fire departments, military and several other organizations.

==History==

In 1930, &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; became an SS rank and was originally bestowed upon those officers who commanded &quot;SS-Gruppen&quot; and also upon senior officers of the SS command staff. In 1932, the SS was reorganized and the &quot;SS-Gruppen&quot; were reformed into &quot;SS-Abschnitte&quot;. A &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; commanded an &quot;SS-Abschnitt&quot; while a new rank, that of &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;, oversaw the &quot;SS-Oberabschnitte&quot; which were the largest SS units in Germany.

Initially in the SA, NSKK, and SS, the rank of &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; was considered equivalent to a full general, but became regarded as equivalent to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; after 1934. During the Second World War, when the Waffen-SS began using the rank, an SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; was considered equal to a &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and was referred to as &quot;SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS&quot;. &quot;Waffen-SS Gruppenführer&quot; also displayed the shoulder boards of a &quot;Wehrmacht Generalleutnant&quot;.

The insignia for SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; consisted of three oak leaves centred on both collars of an SS uniform. From 1930 to 1942, the SS insignia was the same as the SA badge of rank; however the SS modified the &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; insignia slightly to include a collar pip (stern, a star), upon the creation of the rank &quot;SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; in April 1942.

In the SA, a &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; was typically in charge of a number of regiments (known as &quot;Standarten&quot;) which were formed into &quot;SA-Gruppen&quot;. The rank of &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; was also used in several other Nazi paramilitary groups, among them the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK) and the National Socialist Flyers Corps (NSFK). In October 1944, the rank of &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; was adopted by the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; as a low level non-commissioned officer position in charge of squad sized formations (&quot;Gruppe&quot;) of &quot;Volkssturm&quot; soldiers. The term is also a generic term for the function of a leader of a squad of infantry (9 or 10 men – &quot;Gruppe&quot;) in the German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;), Waffen-SS, or Luftwaffe ground troops.

<text> (, ) was a paramilitary rank in Nazi Germany that was first created in 1932 as a rank of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) and adopted by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) one year later. Until April 1942, it was the highest commissioned SS rank after only . Translated as &quot;senior group leader&quot;, the rank of was senior to &quot;Gruppenführer&quot;. A similarly named rank of existed in the SA from 1929 to 1930 and as a title until 1933. In April 1942, the new rank of was created which was above and below .

==Creation and history==
The rank of was created in 1932 by Ernst Röhm and was intended as a seniormost rank of the Nazi stormtroopers for use by Röhm and his top SA generals. In its initial concept, the rank was intended to be held by members of the &quot;Oberste SA-Führung&quot; (Supreme SA Command) and also by veteran commanders of certain &quot;SA-Gruppen&quot; (SA groups). Some of the early promotions to the rank included Ernst Röhm, Viktor Lutze, Edmund Heines, August Schneidhuber, and Fritz Ritter von Kraußer.

The rank of SA- was the most senior rank of the until the spring of 1933, when Röhm made the title position of (SA Chief of Staff) into a rank and promoted himself accordingly.

Also in the summer of 1933, Heinrich Himmler was promoted by Adolf Hitler to the newly created rank of SS- with the intent being to make Himmler the equivalent of the senior commanders of the SA, to which the SS was still subordinated. Although Himmler usually referred to himself as , before the summer of 1934, this was simply a title for the SS commander, and not yet an actual rank. Shortly after Himmler&#x27;s promotion, Hitler further promoted Franz Xaver Schwarz, with Himmler&#x27;s date of rank backdated to 1 January 1933 in order to confirm his seniority as the top officer within the SS. Shortly after Rudolf Hess was appointed as his deputy in April 1933, Hitler promoted him to SS-. However, in September, Hitler decreed that Hess should no longer use the title of but only use the title of Deputy Führer.

A number of men were promoted to SS- in 1934, these being Fritz Weitzel, Richard Walther Darré and Walter Buch. After the Night of the Long Knives in July 1934, Sepp Dietrich was promoted to the rank. On 9 September 1934, so as to prevent a power struggle within the SS, Hitler further promoted Kurt Daluege who commanded most of the SS in the Berlin region. Daluege&#x27;s promotion was to avoid the SS splitting into two separate entities, one based in Northern Germany under Daluege and the other in Bavaria under Himmler. This early SS disunity became a non-issue after a common ground was found amongst SS leaders in their general hatred of the SA.

Udo von Woyrsch and Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger were promoted to SS- in 1935 while Josias, Hereditary Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and Max Amann received the rank a year later along with Karl von Eberstein and Philipp Bouhler. The year 1936 saw several promotions to the rank, including Friedrich Jeckeln who would become one of the most infamous SS and police leaders on the Eastern Front during World War II. The last pre-war promotion to the rank of SS- was in April 1939 for Friedrich Graf von der Schulenburg who died the following month. Upon the outbreak of World War II, there were seventeen men who held the rank of SS-.

==Promotion history==
During the Second World War, there were 88 promotions to the rank, of which 22 were considered regular officers of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and the rest members of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;. The first wartime promotions to SS- occurred in April 1940 when the rank was granted to Joachim von Ribbentrop, Martin Bormann and Hans Lammers; Arthur Seyss-Inquart and Otto Dietrich were promoted a year later. All five promotions were honorary SS ranks with the first promotion of an active SS officer occurring in September 1941 when the rank was granted to Reinhard Heydrich. The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; commander, Paul Hausser was promoted to the rank of SS- on 1 October 1941. &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; commander Theodor Eicke was promoted to SS- on 20 April 1942. Sepp Dietrich remained senior, having served as &quot;General der SS-VT&quot; (&quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot;) upon the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

Two SS officers would be demoted from the rank of SS-: Rudolf Hess and Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorff. Hess was stripped of his rank and expelled from both the SS and Nazi Party after his abortive flight to Scotland in 1941. Helldorff was stricken from the SS rolls in 1944 after the 20 July plot against Hitler. Helldorff was a unique case, in that his SS rank had been bestowed for technical reasons in order to command the Berlin Police. While holding SA membership, Helldorff was never actually an SS member although for administrative purposes he held SS rank and was ranked as the 15th most senior SS officer.

A total of 107 men would eventually hold the rank of SS- with 97 such officers listed on the SS seniority list in 1944. Several men with the rank would die during World War II; some of the more notable being Heydrich, Eicke, and Artur Phleps. The last promotion was made in March 1945 to Hans Kammler.

==Rank usage==
The rank of was used by four major paramilitary groups of the Nazi Party, these being the SA, SS, National Socialist Motor Corps, and National Socialist Flyers Corps. The rank would remain the highest SS general officer rank until April 1942, when the rank of &quot;SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; was created.

Standard practice for SS generals serving as an SS and police leader, as well as those senior SS personnel of the RSHA, was to hold dual police rank as SS-. SS- was the equivalent in the armed SS; in 1944, most active SS generals received this designation in order to command military troops during the last days of the war. Approximately fifteen SS generals were ranked as SS-.

SS- was considered the highest rank of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; until April 1942; equivalent to a lieutenant general (three-star general) in the American and British armies. It was only outranked by Himmler&#x27;s special rank of . However, within the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, the rank of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; was equivalent to a , and an SS- came to be considered the equivalent of a &quot;General&quot;; holders were titled in full SS-.

<doc id="670891" wikidata="Q465049" url="?curid=670891" title="Jorge Costa">
<text>Jorge Paulo Costa Almeida (born 14 October 1971) is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a central defender, currently a manager.

Nicknamed &quot;Bicho&quot; (animal) and &quot;Tanque&quot; (tank) by his colleagues and fans for his aggressive and physical playing style, he spent most of his professional career with Porto, being team captain for several seasons and winning a total of 24 major titles, notably eight Primeira Liga championships and the 2004 Champions League.

Having earned 50 caps for Portugal, Costa represented the nation at one World Cup and one European Championship. After retiring, he worked as a manager for several clubs as well as the Gabon national team.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Born in Porto, Costa made his professional debut with Penafiel on loan from hometown club Porto. The following season he was also loaned, to fellow Primeira Liga side Marítimo, appearing in 31 games including a controversial one in the Estádio das Antas where he scored an own goal; despite it being clearly unintentional the accusations of scoring for his team continued, forcing Porto&#x27;s president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa to forbid further loaned players to play against them, a decision that stood for several decades.

Costa finally joined Porto in the 1992–93 campaign, eventually becoming a starter. Five seasons later he switched to jersey No. 2, previously worn by João Pinto, also being named team captain as the veteran retired. His career three only met four black spots: two serious knee injuries (during 1995–96, which ruled him out of UEFA Euro 1996 and during 1997&#x27;s pre-season in Sweden) and a feud with coach Octávio Machado early in 2001–02, which forced him into &quot;exile&quot; at Charlton Athletic. However, the image of Costa as the captain went untouched, and Porto fans turned against Machado with massive criticism of his team management and coaching, eventually forcing him outside the club; during his time in South London, he played in defence alongside Luke Young, Mark Fish and Jonathan Fortune, in a back-line remembered for its pun name of &quot;Young Fish Costa Fortune&quot;.

Additionally, in 1996–97&#x27;s UEFA Champions League, Costa was involved in an incident with A.C. Milan&#x27;s George Weah on 20 November 1996, with the Liberian breaking his nose, alleging that he had been racially abused. Costa strenuously denied the accusations of racism and was not charged by UEFA as no witnesses could verify Weah&#x27;s allegations, not even his Milan teammates. Weah, on the other hand, was suspended for six matches, and later attempted to apologise to Costa but this was rebuffed by the Portuguese, who considered the charges of racist insults levelled against him to be defamatory and took the Liberian to court; the incident resulted in the latter being sidelined for three weeks, also having to undergo facial surgery.

Costa returned to Porto in the summer of 2002 as José Mourinho was now in charge, and was unanimously chosen as captain of a side that went on to win a championship-cup–UEFA Cup treble, making him the third Porto skipper in a row to lift cups at international level (following Pinto and Fernando Gomes). The player&#x27;s winning streak continued as the next season he lifted the Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup.

In January 2006, after having been deemed surplus to requirements by new coach Co Adriaanse, Costa signed for Standard Liège from Belgium, reuniting with former Porto teammate Sérgio Conceição and helping his new team to a runner-up finish in the league. He decided to retire in June for personal reasons, despite having a contract running until 2007.

===International===
Costa made his full international debut for Carlos Queiroz&#x27; Portugal on 11 November 1992 in a 2–1 friendly win over Bulgaria in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, France. He played alongside Fernando Couto as the team reached the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2000 in Belgium and the Netherlands.

Costa scored the first of two goals on 15 November 2000, in a 2–1 exhibition defeat of Israel at the Estádio 1º de Maio in Braga. He retired from international football following group-stage elimination at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, having played 50 games; in that competition, he scored an own goal in the 3–2 loss to the United States.

Previously, in 1991, Costa was first-choice as the Portugal team won the FIFA U-20 World Cup.

==Coaching career==
===2000s===
In the 2006–07 season, Costa began his coaching career with Braga, first as assistant to Rogério Gonçalves, whom he replaced in February 2007. In his first season he led the Minho side to the fourth place and the semi-finals of the domestic cup, also reaching the round of 16 in the UEFA Cup, being ousted by Tottenham Hotspur 6–4 on aggregate.

After again guiding Braga to the UEFA Cup group stage, Costa was fired midway through his second year. He moved to Segunda Liga club Olhanense ahead of 2008–09, eventually finishing as champion and returning the Algarveans to the first division after 34 years. After helping them to 13th place the following campaign – thus safe from relegation – he left, joining fellow top-division Académica de Coimbra.

Costa announced his departure from Académica and his retirement from coaching on 21 December 2010, citing personal reasons. The team was placed ninth after the 14th round, eventually narrowly escaping relegation.

===2010s===
In May 2011, Costa reneged on his retirement and signed a contract with Romania&#x27;s CFR Cluj. He was dismissed the following 8 April with the team five points clear in first place with nine games to go in Liga I, following a 5–0 home loss to nearest challengers Dinamo București.

On 24 October 2012, AEL Limassol appointed Costa as their new manager, on the eve of a Europa League group stage tie against Fenerbahçe. He stayed in Cyprus the following summer, agreeing to a 1+1 deal with Anorthosis.

Costa coached the Gabon national team from 2014 until November 2016, being ousted from the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations group stage after one win and two losses. He returned to club duties on 15 May 2017, being appointed at Sfaxien. He moved back to his homeland in the following off-season, signing at Segunda Liga side Arouca and leaving by mutual consent less than three months later due to a poor string of results.

On 22 November 2017, Costa was hired at Tours, last-placed in France&#x27;s Ligue 2. At the end of the season, with the club relegated in the same position, he resigned with a year remaining on his contract.

In August 2018, Costa signed for Mumbai City for the upcoming campaign of the Indian Super League. After a third-place finish, the team lost 5–2 on aggregate to Goa in the play-off semi-finals, conceding all of those goals in the first leg at home. On 5 March 2020, after finishing one place off qualification for the post-season, he was allowed to leave.

===2020s===
On 23 September 2020, Gustavo Ndong Edu, president of the Equatoguinean Football Federation, announced that Costa would be the new coach of the national team. Six days later, however, he decided to join Romania&#x27;s Gaz Metan Mediaș instead.

Costa returned to the Portuguese top tier on 4 February 2021, replacing the dismissed Sérgio Vieira at Farense on a four-month contract. In spite of relegation to the second division, he signed a new deal; on 30 August, however, he left by mutual consent after only one point in four matches to start the new campaign.

On 3 February 2022, Costa returned to Sfaxien for the remainder of the season. He was dismissed on 7 April after a six-game winless run, concluding with a 1–1 draw at home to Hammam-Sousse.

Costa went back to his country&#x27;s second tier on 7 September 2022, being hired by Académico de Viseu in place of Pedro Ribeiro. On 20 December, he led the team to a 2–1 home win over top-flight club Boavista to make the semi-finals of the Taça da Liga for the first time; they were eliminated there by Porto, as in the quarter-finals of the national cup. In spite of collecting 20 victories in 34 matches, and with his side placed fourth (17th at the time of his arrival), he left by mutual consent on 20 April 2023.

On 10 June 2023, Costa was confirmed as the manager of AVS of the same league; he was the first manager of the club after Vilafranquense relocated to Vila das Aves due to poor infrastructure. On 7 December, he received a 17-day suspension and a fine for, five days prior, having insulted and threatened the referee in a match against Benfica B. He eventually achieved top-division promotion in the play-offs, beating Portimonense 4–2 on aggregate.

Costa returned to Porto in June 2024, as director of football.

<doc id="670892" wikidata="Q5652729" url="?curid=670892" title="Happy Felsch">
<text>Oscar Emil &quot;Happy&quot; Felsch (August 22, 1891 – August 17, 1964) was an American center fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago White Sox from 1915 to 1920. He is best known for his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal.

==Early life==
Felsch was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to German immigrant parents. He dropped out of school in the sixth grade and played baseball on Milwaukee sandlots. He began his professional baseball career in the Wisconsin-Illinois League in 1913. The next season, he batted .304 and slugged .512 for the American Association&#x27;s Milwaukee Brewers, and was purchased by the White Sox.

==Major league career==
From 1916 to 1920, Felsch was one of the best hitters in the American League, finishing in the top 10 in more than a few major batting categories. His 102 runs batted in was good enough for second place in 1917, as the White Sox won the World Series. He missed most of the 1918 season due to military service.

Felsch continued his good hitting and fielding in 1919. He had a strong throwing arm and was highly regarded as a center fielder; He led the AL in outfield putouts and assists in 1919. The White Sox won the pennant going away.

That fall, Felsch agreed to join a group of White Sox players that planned to intentionally lose the 1919 World Series in exchange for monetary payments from a network of gamblers. He was reluctant to go along with the plan at first but then eventually did because of the money. There was little doubt of Felsch&#x27;s guilt on the field, as he not only hit poorly, but also misplayed flyballs in key situations. Chicago lost the series, five games to three.

For his part in the fix, Felsch received $5,000, which was more than his entire regular season salary of $2,750. However, after the scandal broke in late 1920, Felsch, along with seven other players, was made permanently ineligible for organized baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. 1920, his last season in the majors, was his best. He hit .338 with 14 home runs and 115 runs batted in and it is possible that he would have put up more big numbers in the live-ball era.

Felsch later said, as quoted by the &quot;Chicago American&quot;:
Well, the beans are spilled and I think I&#x27;m through with baseball. I got $5,000. I could have got just about that much by being on the level if the Sox had won the Series. And now I&#x27;m out of baseball—the only profession I know anything about, and a lot of gamblers have gotten rich. The joke seems to be on us.

==Career statistics==
In 749 games over 6 seasons, Felsch posted a .293 batting average (825-for-2812) with 385 runs, 135 doubles, 64 triples, 38 home runs, 443 RBI, 88 stolen bases, 207 bases on balls, .347 on-base percentage and .427 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .975 fielding percentage playing primarily at center field. In the 1917 and 1919 World Series, he hit .229 (11-for-48) with 6 runs, 1 home run and 6 RBI.

==Later life==

Felsch spent the next 15 years touring the country with various amateur and semi-pro teams, including Scobey, Montana Outlaws in 1925 and 1926; Regina, Saskatchewan in 1927 (Regina Balmorals of the Southern Saskatchewan Baseball League), in Virden, Manitoba of the Winnipeg Senior League; and finally in Plentywood, Montana in 1928.

After his playing days ended, he opened up a grocery store as well as a number of drinking establishments.

Felsch died of a liver ailment in Milwaukee in 1964, just five days before his 73rd birthday. He was survived by his wife Marie and three children. He is buried at Wisconsin Memorial Park in Brookfield, Wisconsin.

In the 1988 film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, Felsch was portrayed by Charlie Sheen.

<doc id="670900" wikidata="Q2867082" url="?curid=670900" title="Legislative Assembly of Nunavut">
<text>The Legislative Assembly of Nunavut is the legislative assembly for the Canadian territory of Nunavut. The seat of the Assembly is the Legislative Building of Nunavut in Iqaluit.

Prior to the creation of Nunavut as a Canadian territory on 1 April 1999, the 1999 Nunavut general election was held on 15 February to determine the 1st Nunavut Legislature. The Legislative Assembly was opened by Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, on 7 October 2002, during her Golden Jubilee tour of Canada. In her speech the Queen stated: &quot;I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada&#x27;s newest territory.&quot;

Prior to the opening of the Legislative Building in October 1999 the members met in the gymnasium of the Inuksuk High School.

The Hansard of the assembly is published in Inuktitut (syllabics) and English, making the territory one of three Canadian jurisdictions to produce a bilingual Hansard, along with the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick and both houses of the Parliament of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario.

The territory operates by consensus government; there are no political parties. Approximately two weeks after an election, the newly elected legislature meets in a special session called the Nunavut Leadership Forum to select the Executive Council, or cabinet.

Members of the Legislative Assembly are sworn in by the commissioner of Nunavut.

==Current members==
There are currently 22 seats in the legislature. The current assembly is the sixth in the territory&#x27;s history, and had its membership selected in the 2021 election. Two electoral districts did not have their results finalized on election night, due to margin of less than two percent between two candidates, necessitating a judicial recount. The results of the recount were confirmed by 2 November.

==Notes==
: After recount
: Acclaimed

==G7 Summit 2010==
G7 finance ministers met at the Legislative Building in February 2010 for a two-day meeting. Security at the summit was provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

<doc id="670901" wikidata="Q385804" url="?curid=670901" title="Johann Georg Hiedler">
<text>Johann Georg Hiedler (baptised 28 February 1792 – 9 February 1857) was a journeyman miller who was officially considered to be the paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler by Nazi Germany. However, whether Hiedler was in fact Hitler&#x27;s biological paternal grandfather remains disputed by modern historians.

== Life ==
Johann Georg Hiedler was born to Martin Hiedler (11 November 1762 – 10 January 1829) and his wife Anna Maria Göschl (23 August 1760 – 7 December 1854) in Spital – a part of Weitra, Austria. He was baptized as a Roman Catholic. Hiedler left his family farm and applied for an apprenticeship in milling, and he ended up successfully completing the required qualifications of the apprenticeship, becoming a journeyman miller and lived a nomadic lifestyle. He married a peasant girl in Hoheneich in late 1823, but she died five months later in 1824.

On 10 May 1842, Hiedler married Maria Schicklgruber and became the legal stepfather to her illegitimate five-year-old son, Alois. It was claimed later that Johann Georg had fathered Alois prior to his marriage to Maria, although Alois had been declared illegitimate on his birth certificate and baptism papers; the claim that Johann Georg was the true father of Alois was not made after the marriage of Maria and Johann Georg or during their lifetime. In June 1876, Johann&#x27;s brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler and Alois both returned to Weitra and Johann declared before a Catholic notary that Johann Georg was Alois&#x27; biological father, who had abandoned the child as he himself was living in extreme poverty and was unable to raise him, and had handed over his fatherhood responsibilities to Johann Nepomuk. With the help of three close relatives, Alois was legitimized, and officially changed his name on 6 January 1877, to Alois Hitler, and the parish priest in Döllersheim where the original birth certificate of Alois resided, then changed the details on the baptismal certificate from &quot;Catholic, Male, Illegitimate&quot; to &quot;Johann Georg Hitler&quot; under his father&#x27;s name. He was 39 years old and was known well in the community as Alois Schicklgruber.

Johann Georg Hiedler is one of two people most cited by modern historians as having possibly been the actual paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler. The other one is Johann Nepomuk Hiedler himself, the younger brother of Johann Georg.

During the Nuremberg trials, a claim was made by Hans Frank that Hitler had commissioned him to investigate Hitler&#x27;s family in 1930 after a &quot;blackmail letter&quot; had been received from Hitler&#x27;s nephew, William Patrick Hitler, who allegedly threatened to reveal embarrassing facts about his uncle&#x27;s ancestry. Frank said that the investigation uncovered evidence that Maria Schicklgruber, Hitler&#x27;s paternal grandmother, had been working as a cook in the household of a Jewish man named Leopold Frankenberger before she gave birth to Hitler&#x27;s father, Alois, out of wedlock. Frank claimed that he had obtained from a relative of Hitler&#x27;s by marriage a collection of letters between Maria Schicklgruber and a member of the Frankenberger family that discussed a stipend for her after she left the family&#x27;s employ. According to Frank, Hitler told him that the letters did not prove that the Frankenberger son was his grandfather but rather his grandmother had merely extorted money from Frankenberger by threatening to claim his paternity of her illegitimate child.

Frank accepted this explanation, but added that it was still just possible that Hitler had some Jewish ancestry. But he thought it unlikely because, &quot;from his entire demeanor, the fact that Adolf Hitler had no Jewish blood coursing through his veins seems so clearly evident that nothing more need be said on this.&quot;

Given that all Jews had been expelled from the province of Styria (which includes Graz) in the 15th century and were not allowed to return until the 1860s, decades after Alois&#x27; birth, scholars such as Ian Kershaw and John Toland dismiss as baseless the Frankenberger hypothesis, which before had only Frank&#x27;s speculation to support it. There is no evidence outside of Frank&#x27;s statements for the existence of a &quot;Leopold Frankenberger&quot; living in Graz in the 1830s, and Frank&#x27;s story is inaccurate on several points such as the claim that Maria Schicklgruber came from &quot;Leonding near Linz&quot;, when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones near the village of Döllersheim.

<doc id="670902" wikidata="Q11150767" url="?curid=670902" title="Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel">
<text>The uniforms and insignia of the &quot;[[Schutzstaffel]]&quot; (SS) served to distinguish its Nazi paramilitary ranks between 1925 and 1945 from the ranks of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (the German armed forces from 1935), the German state, and the Nazi Party.

==Uniform design and function==

While different uniforms existed for the SS over time, the all-black SS uniform adopted in 1932 is the most well known. The black–white–red colour scheme was characteristic of the German Empire, and it was later adopted by the Nazi Party. Further, black was popular with fascist movements: a black uniform was introduced by the blackshirts in Italy before the creation of the SS. There was a traditional reason, too: just as the Prussian kings&#x27; and emperors&#x27; life-guard cavalry (&quot;Leibhusaren&quot;) had worn black uniforms with skull-and-crossbones badges, so would the &quot;Führer&quot;″s bodyguard unit. These SS uniforms were tailored to project authority and foster fear. During the war, the German clothing factory that eventually became the international menswear powerhouse Hugo Boss produced thousands of SS and other uniforms.

Once the war began, the black uniform was seldom worn. The combat units of the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT) and the later &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; wore a variation of the field-grey (grey-green) (&quot;feldgrau&quot;) army uniform with SS insignia. The majority of SS personnel wore a variation of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; uniform or the grey-green SS service tunic. Branches with personnel that normally would wear civilian attire in the Reich (such as the Gestapo and Kripo) were issued grey-green SS uniforms in occupied territory to avoid being mistaken for civilians.

SS uniforms used a variety of insignia, the most standard of which were collar patches, to denote rank, and shoulder knots (which acted as shoulder boards), to denote both rank and position, along with sleeve cuff titles and &quot;sleeve diamond&quot; patches, to indicate membership in specific branches of the SS.

==Uniform designs and styles==
===Early SS uniforms (1925–1928)===

The SS could trace its origins to several early &quot;Freikorps&quot; and Nazi Party formations, among them the Erhardt Naval Brigade, &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, and most significantly the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), of which the SS was originally a subordinate organisation.

The very first SA uniforms and insignia were paramilitary uniforms fashioned by early Nazis which incorporated parts from World War I uniforms to include such features used by other &quot;Freikorps&quot; formation such as high boots, daggers, and the kepi hat. The 8-man &quot;Stabswache&quot; (staff guard), Adolf Hitler&#x27;s bodyguard, soon renamed the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; (shock troop), also adopted in May 1923 the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; (death&#x27;s head) and oak leaf as a means of insignia, both of which were already deeply rooted in European military history.

In 1924, while the Nazi Party was legally banned following the Beer Hall Putsch, &quot;Frontbann&quot; (underground SA) leader Gerhard Roßbach located a large store of war-surplus brown denim shirts in Austria, originally intended for tropical uniforms. When the SA (which included the nascent SS) was re-founded in 1925 following Hitler&#x27;s release from prison, these brown shirts were issued as part of the uniforms.

In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; (protection command). It was formed by Julius Schreck and included old &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; members, Emil Maurice and Erhard Heiden. The only insignia was the swastika armband, usually homemade, except for the handful of men constituting the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; successor, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot;, who continued the use of the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; pinned to cap or collar. That same year, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; was expanded to a national level. It was renamed successively the &quot;Sturmstaffel&quot; (storm squadron), and finally the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (protection squadron), abbreviated to SS (on 9 November). In the following year adopted its first recognisable rank insignia system, with the rank and file of the SS, like the rest of the SA, still wearing a variety of brown shirts or paramilitary uniforms.

The early rank system of 1926 consisted of a swastika armband worn with yellow (gold) and white (silver) stripes, with the number of stripes determining the rank of the bearer. Thus, the early SS used a ranking system that could be derived from that of their superordinate SA. This is why the SS also used the system that represented the function of the SS leader with the help of stripes on the armband (&quot;Dienststellungs-Armbinde&quot;). All strips (gold and silver) had a uniform height of 1 cm. What all armbands had in common was that they also had 1 black ribbed stripe on each edge.

* &quot;Reichsstaffelführer in der Obersten SA-Führung&quot; (national leader): three golden stripes
* &quot;Stellvertreter&quot; (deputy national leader): three silver stripes
* &quot;Gau-SS-Führer&quot; (district leader): two golden stripes
* &quot;Stellvertreter&quot; (deputy district leader): two silver stripes
* &quot;Örtlicher SS-Führer&quot; (regional leader): one golden stripe
* &quot;Stellvertreter&quot; (deputy regional leader): one silver stripe
* &quot;Staffelmann&quot; (trooper): no stripes

Under the above system, basic SS troopers were organised into 10-man &quot;Staffeln,&quot; each under the authority of a &quot;Staffelführer&quot;. SS districts, known as &quot;SS-Gaus&quot;, were under the authority of a &quot;Gauführer&quot; while all SS district leaders answered to a national leader of the SS called the &quot;Reichsführer&quot;, at this time Joseph Berchtold. In line with the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; (leader principle) of the Nazi Party&#x27;s ideology, the word &quot;Führer&quot; was incorporated into all ranks except those for basic SS troopers.

By 1927, the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; had greatly increased its numbers and had standardised the &quot;brown shirt&quot; uniform, which would thereafter be permanently associated with that group: shirt, tie, breeches, boots, and cylindrical kepi, all brown. The SS was at this time a small unit within the SA and wore the same brown SA uniform, with the addition of a black tie and a black cap with a &quot;Totenkopf&quot; skull and bones symbol to distinguish themselves.

By this time, with influences from the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;, the SA leadership adopted its first collar insignia and also added a new SA rank of &quot;Standartenführer&quot; (standard leader) in charge of regiment-sized &quot;Standarten&quot; (incorporating the company sized &quot;Staffeln&quot;); the SS at this time adopted the same rank as well.

The 1927 ranks had no insignia for SA/SS troopers (still known by the title &quot;Mann&quot;) and the previous rank of &quot;Staffelführer&quot; had become shortened to simply &quot;Führer&quot; (leader). The higher SS ranks of &quot;Standartenführer&quot;, &quot;Gauführer&quot;, and &quot;Reichsführer&quot; like their SA counterparts now used a system of oak leaves displayed on both collars of the brown SA shirt. One oak leaf signified a &quot;Standartenführer&quot;, two a &quot;Gauführer&quot;, and three oak leaves were worn by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Berchtold and his successor Erhard Heiden, who reported directly to the &quot;Oberste SA-Führer&quot;.

Over the course of the next year, the burgeoning SA saw the emergence of new units and ranks, and for the first time a comprehensive system of rank insignia. A basic squad unit, the 10-man &quot;Schar&quot;, was grouped into platoon-sized &quot;Truppen&quot;, and these into company-sized &quot;Stürme&quot; which in turn made up battalion-sized &quot;Sturmbanne.&quot; New ranks went with the new formations: &quot;Scharführer&quot;, with one pip worn on the left collar patch, &quot;Truppführer&quot;, two pips, &quot;Sturmführer&quot;, three pips, and &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;, four pips. On the right collar of SA uniforms was worn a patch with two numbers indicating &quot;Standarte&quot; and &quot;Sturmbann&quot; affiliation. As the SS numbered fewer than a thousand men, it did not adopt the &quot;Sturmbann&quot; unit at this time, and right-hand SS collar patches displayed the number of the &quot;Standarte&quot; only.

At the higher end of the organisation, in 1928 the SA &quot;Gau-Stürme&quot; were restructured into regional &quot;Gruppen,&quot; each commanded by a leader with a new general-officer rank, &quot;Gruppenführer&quot;; its insignia was the three oak leaf collar patch. At this time the former rank of &quot;Gauführer&quot; was renamed &quot;Oberführer&quot; (senior leader).

The collar patches of the SA were color-coded: each &quot;Gruppe&quot; had its own distinctive color. The SS was considered to be a &quot;Gruppe&quot; unto itself; its color, naturally, was black, and &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heiden held the rank of &quot;Gruppenfuhrer&quot; and wore its three oak leaf insignia.

===SS Brownshirts (1929–1932)===
In 1929, under new &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, the SS codified its first uniform regulations: the signature black color was extended to breeches, boots, armband edges, and belt and crossbelt; the shirt collar was edged in black-and-white twist cord except for those of senior leaders, which were trimmed in silver.

The ability to produce and issue complete uniforms came about due both to the centralisation of the &quot;Reichszeugmeisterei&quot; (RZM; national quartermaster office) under NSDAP Treasurer Franz Xaver Schwarz, and to Himmler&#x27;s expansion and reorganisation of the fast-growing SS (from 280 members to 52,000 between 1929 and 1932) into several brigade-sized &quot;Brigaden&quot; throughout Germany, each comprising three to five regiment-sized &quot;Standarten&quot;. Within the &quot;Standarten&quot; now existed two to three battalion-sized &quot;Sturmbanne&quot; (storm units), and beneath this level were the &quot;Stürme&quot;, &quot;Truppen&quot;, and &quot;Scharen&quot;.
For the lower ranks, the SS also specified that a patch showing the wearer&#x27;s regiment (&quot;Standarte&quot;) would be worn opposite the badge of rank while the higher SS leaders would continue to wear oak leaf insignia on both collars. Collar tabs below the rank of &quot;Sturmführer&quot; were edged in black-and-white twist cord; those of &quot;Sturm&quot; and &quot;Sturmbann&quot; leaders used black-and-silver while those of senior leaders were edged in solid silver cord.

In addition to the collar unit insignia, the SS now created a cuffband system which was worn on the lower left sleeve. These cuffbands were black and displayed the bearer&#x27;s &quot;Sturm&quot; number together with color-coded edges indicating the &quot;Sturmbann&quot;, which in conjunction with the collar insignia showed regiment, battalion, and company affiliation. Leaders above the company level did not at this time use the cuffband system.

The holder of the title of &quot;Reichsführer&quot; was still considered an SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot;, with &quot;Reichsführer&quot; itself not yet an actual rank. In addition, for a brief period in 1929, the rank of &quot;Standartenführer&quot; was divided into two separate grades, known as &quot;Standartenführer (I)&quot; and &quot;Standartenführer (II)&quot;; the insignia of one oak leaf was used for both positions. This situation was another reflection of the SS&#x27; rapid expansion: &quot;Oberführers&quot; now commanded the three newly created &quot;SS-Oberführerbereiche&quot;, east, west and south; and so a senior &quot;Standartenführer&quot; was promoted to command each &quot;SS-Brigade&quot;.

Hitler&#x27;s personal guard, known at this stage by the original SS name of &quot;Stabswache&quot; (later to be known as the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; Adolf Hitler), was also expressing its independence and increasing its size under the leadership of Sepp Dietrich.

The Stennes revolt of August 1930, in which members of the SA attacked the Berlin party &quot;Gau&quot; headquarters which was defended by the SS, had profound consequences for the SA and its relationship to its subordinate organisation. In an open letter to Berlin SS leader Kurt Daluege, Hitler proclaimed &quot;SS Mann, deine Ehre heißt Treue!&quot; (SS soldier, your honour is called loyalty!). Subsequently, &quot;Meine Ehre heißt Treue&quot; (My honour is loyalty) was adopted by the SS as its motto. More significantly, Hitler cashiered SA head Franz Pfeffer von Salomon and assumed the position of &quot;Oberste SA-Führer&quot; personally, and simultaneously promoted both Himmler and Daluege to the new rank of SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;. Daluege was the SS leader of Northern Germany while Himmler controlled southern SS units out of Munich while serving as the National Leader for the SS; this move had the effect of rendering the loyal SS practically independent of the suspect SA, since Himmler and Daluege now outranked all SA commanders.

Another result of the Stennes revolt was Hitler&#x27;s recall of his old &quot;Putsch&quot; comrade Ernst Röhm from South America to take over the day-to-day running of the SA with the title of &quot;SA-Stabschef&quot;. While Hitler thought that this would bind the SA more firmly to him, Röhm had other ambitions, including the conversion of the paramilitary &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; into an army. With his expansions, promotions, and changes to the SA, a revision of the SA rank system was required although the uniforms and titles essentially stayed the same. The first major change was the addition of new ranks modeled on the original titles created in 1928 but with the addition of &quot;senior&quot; and &quot;head&quot; designators (&quot;ober&quot; and &quot;haupt&quot;): these were &quot;Oberscharführer&quot;, &quot;Obertruppführer,&quot; and &quot;Sturmhauptführer&quot;. The new rank insignia were created by adding a silver stripe to the collar pips of the next-lower rank.

A 1930 change to the SS uniform was the addition of a single narrow shoulder strap worn on the right side. There were four grades of shoulder strap: until 1933 a black-and-white pattern was worn by SS troopers, an epaulette of parallel silver cords by &quot;Sturm&quot; and &quot;Sturmbann&quot; leaders, a twisted pattern in silver cord by &quot;standarten-&quot;, &quot;ober-&quot;, and &quot;Gruppenführers&quot;, and a braided silver shoulderboard by the two &quot;Obergruppenführers&quot;.

By 1931, Himmler was secure (or independent) enough to reorganise the SS, formerly one &quot;SA-Gruppe&quot;, into five &quot;SS-Gruppen&quot; divided into several &quot;Brigaden&quot; led by officers with the new rank of &quot;Brigadeführer&quot;; its insignia was the two oak leaves of an &quot;Oberführer&quot; with a pip.

===SS black uniforms (1932–1934)===

In 1932, the SS introduced its best-known uniform, the black ensemble designed by Karl Diebitsch and graphic designer and SS member Walter Heck. The shirt remained brown as a nod to the SA, of which the SS was still nominally a part, but all else was black from high boots to the new military-style peaked cap, aside from the red armband. SS men were also issued black wool greatcoats for inclement weather, which similarly carried the armband, epaulette, and collar patches. Around this time, a belt buckle featuring the motto &quot;Meine Ehre heißt Treue&quot; (My honour is loyalty) in its design was produced by the Overhoff firm to replace the SA buckle.

Two new junior positions were introduced: &quot;Sturmmann&quot; and &quot;Rottenführer&quot;. By this time, Himmler had also increased scrutiny on SS membership with a particular focus on proof of &quot;Aryan&quot; ancestry, and created a &quot;candidate&quot; position known as &quot;SS-Anwärter&quot;, which prospective SS members were required to hold for at least six months before formally joining the SS as an &quot;SS-Mann&quot;. With membership continuing to increase, Röhm invented two new officer ranks: &quot;Obersturmführer&quot; and &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot;.

In 1933, after Hitler had become Chancellor, the SS began to make more of a distinction between &#x27;officers&#x27; and &#x27;enlisted men;&#x27; an SS man could now only be promoted to &quot;Sturmführer&quot; with Himmler&#x27;s approval, based upon the &quot;Reichsführer&quot;’s personal review of the candidate&#x27;s application. Himmler always detested the army&#x27;s class distinctions. It was forbidden for SS men to follow the army custom of addressing superior officers by prefixing &quot;Herr&quot; to their rank, and &quot;Kamerad&quot; was an approved form of address under most circumstances.

Also in 1933, the runes insignia was introduced, which would eventually become known as the symbol for the entire SS. The first use of the SS runes was as a unit insignia limited only to members of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; Adolf Hitler which had replaced the Army Chancellery Guard to become Hitler&#x27;s main protectors. It was at this time that the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; moved from being a &quot;paramilitary&quot; formation armed with pistols and truncheons to &quot;military&quot;, equipped with rifles, bayonets, and steel helmets. The adaptation of this particular unit insignia was largely the work of Sepp Dietrich who on 4 November 1933, declared the unit an independent formation and, although a part of the SS, answerable to Hitler alone. Dietrich even went so far as to forbid Himmler from entering the Berlin &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; barracks and, for a brief few months in 1933, ordered his &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; soldiers to wear the black uniform without a swastika armband in order to differentiate the bodyguard unit from the rank and file of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; (General SS) units throughout Germany.

At the same time Dietrich and the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; adopted the SS runes as their unit insignia, the full-time SS headquarters and command staffs began using a blank collar patch, without a unit number, to differentiate themselves from the &quot;rank and file&quot; SS units in Germany which were still using regiment &quot;Standarten&quot; numbers as their unit insignia. Thus, by the end of 1933, there were three unit collar insignia patches in existence: the SS runes used by the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot;, the blank collar patch used by the SS headquarters and command staff, and the numbered SS unit insignia worn by regular SS companies throughout Germany.

In 1934, with the rise of the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT), the SS runes unit insignia was expanded to these other formations of the then fledgling military arm of the SS (later to become known as the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;). To separate these new military formations from the main &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; regiment under Dietrich, the SS runes worn by the &quot;Verfügungstruppe&quot; displayed a small number corresponding to the particular SS-VT regiment of the bearer. In all, there were three possible numbers: 1 for members of the &quot;Deutschland&quot; regiment, 2 for &quot;Germania&quot; personnel, and (from 1938) 3 for members of the &quot;Der Führer&quot; regiment. These insignia would survive throughout World War II and were kept in use after the three original regiments had expanded to full-sized military regimental strength in the war-time 2nd SS Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;, roughly equivalent in size to their German Army counterparts.

In addition to the expansion of the collar unit insignia system, the SS by 1934 had also greatly expanded the system of sleeve cuffbands which were now a standard part of the black uniform, worn on the lower left sleeve. Within the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; companies, cuffbands were worn in conjunction with a unit collar patch to denote regiment, battalion, and company affiliation. While the unit collar patch displayed the wearer&#x27;s &quot;Standarte&quot; (regiment) number, the number denoted on the cuffband indicated the &quot;Sturm&quot;, or company, while collared piping along the cuffband further denoted in which battalion (&quot;Sturmbann&quot;) a member served.

For those personnel serving above the regiment level, a bare cuffband was worn or a cuffband bearing a Roman numeral could be displayed. The Roman numeral cuffband indicated membership on the staff of the &quot;SS-Brigade&quot; so numbered, which by the end of 1934 had become known as an &quot;SS-Abschnitt&quot;. For the even higher levels, such as Himmler or the senior &quot;SS-Gruppe&quot; leaders (later known by the title &quot;SS-Oberabschnitt Führer&quot;) a solid silver cuffband was worn.

Within the early military SS, which included the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; and the formations of the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot;, a series of cuffbands were introduced which bore the name of the regiment to which the bearer was assigned. The most coveted of these was the &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; cuffband, carrying the &quot;Führer&quot;’s name in Sütterlin script, which was worn solely by members of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot;.

===SS pre-war uniforms (1934–1938)===
An event that significantly altered the SS rank and insignia structure was the Night of the Long Knives, which occurred from 30 June to 2 July 1934. As a result of SS participation in the purge and execution of the SA leadership, the SS was declared an independent formation of the Nazi Party that answered only to Hitler. Several of the rank titles were renamed to completely separate the SS from its SA origins.

The most significant rank change was the creation of the rank of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; to denote the commander of the SS. The new rank was the equivalent of a field marshal in the army. Prior to 1934, Himmler had been regarded simply as an SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;. &quot;Reichsführer&quot; was merely a title and not a rank prior to 1934, though Himmler preferred to use his title more than his rank. In addition to Himmler’s new rank, several of the original SS rank titles were renamed (although retained the same insignia), bringing about the final nomenclature of SS ranks which would be used until the SS was disbanded at the end of World War II.

The change in SS rank titles applied mainly to the non-commissioned officer ranks as well as the ranks of &quot;Sturmführer&quot; and &quot;Sturmhauptführer&quot; which received new names. The titles of the remaining ranks remained unchanged.

In the wake of the &quot;Röhm-Putsch&quot;, the SS officially took over the concentration camps from the SA and police. Soon thereafter, camp guards began wearing the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; on the right collar patch, to distinguish themselves from the numbered &quot;Allgemeine-SS Standarten&quot;. This was inconsistent in the early days; some guards instead wore tabs with the initial of their camp (e. g. &quot;D&quot; for Dachau), and some wore blank tabs. About 1935, the black uniform proving impractical for daily service wear, the Inspectorate of Concentration Camps adopted a working uniform in &quot;earth-brown&quot; (&quot;erdbraun&quot;), which was identical in cut to the black tunic except for shoulderboards on both sides. In March 1936, the camp &quot;service&quot; was formally established as the third branch of the SS, the &quot;Totenkopfverbände&quot; or Death&#x27;s Head units


At about this same time, for similar reasons, the SS military formations (the &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; and the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot;) adopted a service uniform in what was termed &quot;earth-grey&quot; (&quot;erdgrau&quot;). This also was based on the black uniform, but without the red swastika armband, its place on the left sleeve being taken by an eagle-and-swastika patch, and worn with trousers and shoes or calf-high jackboots. In June 1938 this uniform was authorised for full-time &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; cadres as well; the LSSAH and SS-VT then adopted army-pattern shoulderboards to distinguish themselves from the general SS and emphasise their military role.

In February 1934, the Honour Chevron for the Old Guard (&quot;Ehrenwinkel für Alte Kämpfer&quot;; honour chevron for old campaigners) was introduced for all SS men who had joined the Nazi Party or a Party-affiliated organisation prior to January 30, 1933; after the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, it was also authorised for Austrians who had joined the DNSAP prior to 18 February 1938. It took the form of a silver lace chevron worn on the right sleeve. During this period, the principal SS insignia also underwent design changes. The ancient jawless &quot;Danziger&quot; style of &quot;Totenkopf&quot; was gradually replaced by the &#x27;classic&#x27; SS skull, a naturalistic design with grinning jaws; the old form was taken up by the army&#x27;s newly formed &quot;Panzerwaffe&quot;. Additionally, in March 1936, Hitler approved a new art deco eagle with staggered wingtips for the SS, which was worn through the end of the war as a cap badge and on the sleeve.

By the end of 1938, the SS had also adopted a new insignia feature of sleeve diamonds worn on the bottom of the left sleeve. Between 1939 and 1940, the SS expanded its cuffband and sleeve diamond system into a vast array of over 30 cuffbands and more than 12 sleeve diamonds.

===SS uniforms of World War II (1939–1945)===
When World War II began in 1939, the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; grey service uniforms took on a more military appearance with the somewhat &quot;ad-hoc&quot; adoption of &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;-style shoulderboards, except for SS generals, who, until 1942, continued to wear the narrow braided silver SS shoulderboards to denote general rank. It was also at this time that the rank of SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; lost its status as a general officer rank and was instead now regarded as a senior colonel position. The black uniform was increasingly seldom seen, eventually being worn only by part-time &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; reservists. The last ceremonial event at which the black uniforms were worn &quot;en masse&quot; was the Berlin victory parade following the fall of France in June 1940. In 1942, Himmler ordered most of the black uniforms recalled and stripped of insignia. They were sent east for use by the native auxiliary police units and sent west to be used by Germanic SS units such as the ones in the Netherlands and Denmark. In 1937, the LSSAH and SS-VT had adopted a closed-collar &quot;feldgrau&quot; (grey-green) field uniform for combat wear, which with the outbreak of war became the standard uniform of what would soon be the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. This &quot;feldanzug&quot; was very similar to the Model 1936 army field uniform; however, the SS version had a somewhat wider collar in &quot;feldgrau&quot; (field-grey) rather than &quot;Heer&quot; bottle-green, the lower pockets were of the SS angled slash type, and the second button was placed lower to permit the collar optionally to be worn open with a necktie like the service-dress uniforms. The &quot;Totenkopf&quot; branch, which was designated the reserve for the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, also adopted this uniform. &quot;Waffen-SS Panzer&quot; troops wore a double-breasted black uniform similar to the army model, but somewhat different in cut; the SS also made extensive use of camouflage clothing as the war progressed. The full-time &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; cadres, especially Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) personnel, continued to wear the earth-grey service-dress uniform.

A unique situation developed during World War II with regards to SS ranks held by those who had served in &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; positions from before the outbreak of war and now wished to serve with the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. With such persons being SS members already, it was expected that they would join the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; in order to serve in combat; some members in fact had no choice and were drafted for combat service due to their &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; billet being done away with or, in situations involving disciplinary actions, transferred into combat as the result of a hearing before an SS and police court; Wilhelm Höttl was one such example.

As a result of &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; members transferring into the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, SS members held two separate ranks – one in the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; and another in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; officers could also hold a regular or reserve commission, with most &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; members being appointed to the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; reserves (the intent was to easily be able to place such members on inactive duty once the war had ended).

The security forces of the SS, such as SD troops that were part of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, were also all considered part of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;, even though many of these persons (especially in the field) wore uniforms nearly identical to the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;; to further the confusion, many agents of the security police (SiPo) in such &quot;field&quot; roles wore &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; uniform even though they were not &quot;ex officio&quot; members of any branch of the SS. By 1943, the SS had made a determined effort that most field personnel (including concentration camp staffs) were granted &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; ranks and, in 1944, any &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; who served in an area that commanded SS combat troops, was granted a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; commission.

Another uniform insignia change occurred in April 1942 with the creation of the rank of &quot;SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot;. This necessitated an insignia change for SS generals and all SS generals at this time began wearing &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;-style gold shoulder boards; &quot;Oberführers&quot; wore the shoulderboards of an army &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel), just as &quot;Standartenführers&quot; did. The sole exception was Himmler who continued to wear the silver braided shoulderboard with oak leaves of his rank as &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;. At the same time the collar patches for general officers were revised; the 1942 pattern used three oak leaves, rather straighter than the old style, with zero to three pips indicating rank from &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; through &quot;Oberstgruppenführer&quot;.

SS uniform suppliers could not keep up with wartime demand and, as a result, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and &quot;Totenkopfverbande&quot; frequently wore uniforms drawn from army stocks, with the addition of SS insignia. By the middle of World War II, a wide variety of uniforms could be observed, even within the same unit.

&quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and SS-TV members during this period wore army-style shoulderboards with SS collar patches; edging of enlisted collar tabs was discontinued in 1940 while SS officers&#x27; collar patches continued to be trimmed in silver. Enlisted shoulderboards were made of black fabric as opposed to army dark green or field-grey (grey-green), and officers had a black underlay; all shoulderboards were piped in &quot;waffenfarbe&quot; (branch-colour). Junior leaders (&quot;Sturmmann&quot; and &quot;Rottenführer&quot;) wore sleeve chevrons corresponding to army insignia (&quot;Gefreiter&quot; and &quot;Obergefreiter&quot;), but with black backing; SS non-commissioned officers wore army-style silver-grey braid around the collar.

By 1943, a special staff non-commissioned officer position, known as &quot;Stabsscharführer&quot; had been adopted by the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. This position, equivalent to an army &quot;Hauptfeldwebel&quot;, was denoted by a special sleeve insignia and was not an actual rank, but rather a title for the head SS non-commissioned officer of a particular combat unit. The rank of &quot;Sturmscharführer&quot; was also unique to the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; as a type of regimental sergeant major.

The staffs of concentration camps had by now standardised the skull collar patch, whereas between 1934 and 1938 the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; as well as various camp specific collar patches, displaying Germanic letters, had been used as unit insignia. Other unit insignia collar patches included a &quot;Standarte&quot;-number patch for most of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;, a blank collar patch worn by SS main office staffs and &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (and some SiPo) personnel, the sig-runes &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; patch (adopted after 1943 as the standard unit collar patch for most of the SS), and a numbered skull patch which was used by personnel serving in field units of the &quot;Totenkopfverbände&quot;; the three senior &quot;Totenkopfstandarten&quot;, formed into the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; division, would retain these collar patches throughout the war, but the remaining &quot;TK-Standarten&quot; were redesignated &quot;SS-Regimenter&quot; and switched to sig-runes in February 1941. As the war went on, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; recruited heavily among conquered populations, creating &#x27;ethnic&#x27; brigades and divisions. These formations wore, in place of the sig-runes, distinctive unit collar patches identifying them as &quot;Freiwillige&quot; (foreign volunteers). In the last days of World War II, the SS also created a twin swastika collar patch which was used by the &quot;auxiliary SS&quot; which were non-SS members conscripted to serve in concentration camp positions.

SS generals of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were typically addressed by both their SS rank title and a corresponding general&#x27;s rank associated with the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. All such general ranks were followed by the phrase &quot;der Waffen-SS&quot; to distinguish the SS General from their counterparts in the branches of the German military. Thus, a typical title was &quot;Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS&quot;.

==Final SS ranks, 1934–1945==

==Police ranks and insignia==

In 1936, the regular German police, previously agencies of the &quot;Länder&quot; or states, were nationalised and placed under Himmler, who was named &quot;Chef der Deutschen Polizei&quot; (Chief of German Police). The ordinary uniformed police were called the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (order police). Known as the &quot;Orpo&quot;, the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; maintained a separate system of &quot;Orpo&quot; ranks, insignia, and uniforms. It was also possible for SS members to hold dual status in both the &quot;Orpo&quot; and the SS, and SS generals were referred to simultaneously by both rank titles. For instance, an &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; in the SS who was also a police general would be referred to as &quot;Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei&quot; (&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; and General of the Police). In late 1939, &quot;Orpo&quot; personnel were formed into a combat division, recognisable by its use of police insignia; in 1942, this formation was absorbed into the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; to become the 4th SS-Polizei Panzergrenadier Division.

==Germanic SS uniforms and foreign units rank ==

Germanic SS uniforms were modified versions of the original black &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; uniforms and were used strictly by the Germanic SS in occupied countries. These units were provided with surplus black uniforms upon which were displayed country specific insignia. This led to a wide variety of insignia and rank titles depending on the country of origin, although standardised throughout the entire Germanic SS were the rank insignia pips and oak leaves used by the SS proper. The Germanic SS effectively ceased to exist in late 1944, after which time most of its members were folded into the foreign legions of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

As with the SS titles, recruits of non-Germanic countries had the title &quot;Waffen&quot; prefixed to their rank. For instance, an &quot;Unterscharführer&quot; in the foreign legions would be referred to as &quot;Waffen-Unterscharführer&quot; whereas a regular SS member would be addressed as SS-&quot;Unterscharführer&quot;. This helped to indicate non-native recruits, or to separate Germanic individuals in the divisions composed primarily of non-Germanics.

==Special SS uniforms==
SS officers had the option of purchasing formal dress and mess dress uniforms. The formal uniform was not unlike U.S. or UK dinner-dress uniforms, cut like a civilian tailcoat without the tails, and worn with white or black bowtie and waistcoat.

For use in hot weather climates like Southern Europe and North Africa, a tropical uniform of tan cotton was developed. Insignia was similar to that of standard SS uniforms but in tan thread on black backing. &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; troops were pioneering among German forces in the use of camouflage clothing and wore it extensively during the war. Usually, the camouflage patterns were worn on overall parkas, reversible smocks or helmet covers, with camouflaged tunics being introduced later during the war. Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with some workers being prisoners-of-war performing forced labour. Many were produced in Nazi concentration camps.

==SS titles==
In addition to the rank titles used by the SS, the following titles were frequently interchanged when addressing SS personnel in certain positions of authority.
* &quot;SS-Mann&quot;: A generic term for any member of the SS. Also used as an actual rank of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;
* &quot;SS-Führer&quot;: Originally an early rank of the SS, the term &quot;SS-Führer&quot; designated commissioned officers of the SS and means &quot;SS leader&quot;.
* &quot;SS-Unterführer&quot;: This term designated non-commissioned officers in the SS. An enlisted SS soldier, applying for non-commissioned officer status, was often known as an &quot;Unterführer-Anwärter&quot;.
* &quot;SD-Leiter&quot;: This title was used by senior officers of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, typically those in command of a major SD office or regional headquarters.
* &quot;SS- und Polizeiführer&quot;: Translated as &quot;SS and police leader&quot;, these were some of the most powerful men in the SS, commanding all SS, Gestapo, Kripo, and Orpo units in a given geographic region, often of the size of a major military district.
* &quot;Oberster Führer der Schutzstaffel&quot;: (), was a special title intended to be held solely by Adolf Hitler. When the SS became an independent organisation from the SA in 1934, Hitler was listed on SS officer rolls as SS member #1 and the group&#x27;s Supreme Commander. This title was intended to give Hitler a technically higher SS rank to Himmler (Reich Leader of the SS), but there is no photographic record of Hitler wearing an SS uniform, and there was no special SS insignia for Hitler above that worn by Himmler.

===Secret police ranks===

In addition, any SS member who also served in the Gestapo or Kripo held a unique criminal investigator rank, one of the more common of which was &quot;Kriminalrat&quot;, a police investigator&#x27;s rank denoting professional detectives. Arthur Nebe, a career policeman, went by the title of &quot;Kriminalrat&quot; for most of the 1930s, only using an SS rank when engaged in non-Kripo activities. The Gestapo also maintained an entire array of ranks, which might be used interchangeably with SS rank if the agent also belonged to the SS (many did not).

==SS membership numbers==
Adolf Hitler, as the &quot;Führer&quot; of Germany, was considered SS member #1; Emil Maurice (one of the founders of the SS) was member #2. Based on the seniority system of SS membership numbers, this made Hitler senior in the SS to all other members. The SS membership number system was also a means to denote the &quot;old guard&quot; of the SS, and to hold a number below 50,000 was considered a special place of honor since it denoted SS membership before the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. Numbers below 500 were considered the original cadre of the SS, while any number below fifty denoted an original founder and, in most cases, a personal associate of Hitler.

<doc id="670910" wikidata="Q110763745" url="?curid=670910" title="Terri Schiavo case">
<text>The Terri Schiavo case was a series of court and legislative actions in the United States from 1998 to 2005, regarding the care of Theresa Marie Schiavo (née Schindler) (; December 3, 1963 – March 31, 2005), a woman in an irreversible persistent vegetative state. Schiavo&#x27;s husband and legal guardian argued that Schiavo would not have wanted prolonged artificial life support without the prospect of recovery, and, in 1998, he elected to remove her feeding tube. Schiavo&#x27;s parents disputed her husband&#x27;s assertions and challenged Schiavo&#x27;s medical diagnosis, arguing in favor of continuing artificial nutrition and hydration. The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents, which ultimately involved state and federal politicians up to the level of George W. Bush, the then U.S. president, caused a seven-year (1998 to 2005) delay before Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube was ultimately removed.

On February 25, 1990, at age 26, Schiavo went into cardiac arrest at her home in St. Petersburg, Florida. She was resuscitated, but had severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen to her brain and was left comatose. After two and a half months without improvement, her diagnosis was changed to that of a persistent vegetative state. For the next two years, doctors attempted occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy and other experimental therapy, hoping to return her to a state of awareness, without success. In 1998, Schiavo&#x27;s husband Michael Schiavo petitioned the Sixth Circuit Court of Florida to remove her feeding tube pursuant to Florida law. He was opposed by Terri&#x27;s parents, Robert and Mary Schindler. The court determined that Schiavo would not have wished to continue life-prolonging measures, and on April 24, 2001, her feeding tube was removed for the first time, only to be reinserted several days later. On February 25, 2005, a Pinellas County judge again ordered the removal of Terri Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube. Several appeals and federal government intervention followed, which included Bush returning to Washington, D.C., to sign legislation moving the case to the federal courts. After appeals through the federal court system that upheld the original decision to remove the feeding tube, staff at the Pinellas Park hospice facility disconnected the feeding tube on March 18, 2005, and Schiavo died on March 31, 2005.

The Schiavo case involved 14 appeals and numerous legal motions, petitions, and hearings in the Florida courts; five suits in federal district court; extensive political intervention at the levels of the Florida state legislature, Governor Jeb Bush, the U.S. Congress, and President George W. Bush; and four denials of &quot;certiorari&quot; from the Supreme Court of the United States. The case also spurred highly visible activism from the United States anti-abortion movement, the right-to-die movement, and disability rights groups. Since Schiavo&#x27;s death, both her husband and her family have written books on their sides of the case, and both have also been involved in activism over related issues.

==Background==
===Early life===
Terri Schiavo was born Theresa Marie Schindler to Mary (born 1941) and Robert Schindler (1937–2009) on December 3, 1963, in Lower Moreland Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. She was the oldest of three children. Her mother reported that, as a child, Schiavo would spend hours in her bedroom arranging her collection of stuffed animals. As a teen, she enjoyed listening to John Denver and reading Danielle Steel romances. She attended Bucks County Community College, where she met Michael Schiavo in 1982. The two began dating and married on November 10, 1984. They moved to Florida in 1986, following her parents. Michael worked as a restaurant manager, while Terri took up a bookkeeping job with an insurance company. She had naturally dark hair, but dyed it blonde.

===Initial medical crisis: 1990===
In the early morning of February 25, 1990, Schiavo collapsed in a hallway of her St. Petersburg, Florida apartment. Firefighters and paramedics, arriving in response to her husband Michael&#x27;s 9-1-1 call, found her face-down and unconscious. She was not breathing and had no pulse. They attempted to resuscitate her and she was transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. Paramedics had her intubated and ventilated.

====Initial medical assessments====
The cause of Schiavo&#x27;s collapse was determined to be cardiac arrest. Her medical chart contained a note that &quot;she apparently has been trying to keep her weight down with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses of iced tea.&quot; Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted as suffering from hypokalemia (low potassium levels): her serum potassium level was an abnormally low 2.0 mEq/L (the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0 mEq/L). Her sodium and calcium levels were normal. Electrolyte imbalance is often caused by drinking excessive fluids, and a serious consequence of hypokalemia can be heart rhythm abnormalities, including sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. Schiavo was eventually switched from being fed by a nasogastric feeding tube to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube. Garcia J. DeSousa, a board-certified neurologist in St. Petersburg, Florida, who had previously treated Schiavo, cared for her during her initial admission to Humana Northside; both he and Victor Gambone, an internist and Schiavo family physician, independently made the diagnosis of persistent vegetative state within approximately one year after her sudden cardiac arrest.

===Relationship between Terri&#x27;s husband and parents===
From 1990 to 1993, Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers (Terri Schiavo&#x27;s parents) enjoyed an amicable relationship, with the Schindlers allowing Michael to live rent-free in their condominium for several months.

===Rehabilitation efforts: 1990–1993===
In November 1990, Michael Schiavo took Terri to the University of California, San Francisco, for experimental nerve stimulation with a thalamic stimulator. The treatment took several months and was unsuccessful. He returned to Florida with her in January 1991 and admitted her as an inpatient to the Mediplex Rehabilitation Center in Bradenton, Florida. On July 19, 1991, Schiavo was transferred to the Sabal Palms Skilled Care Facility, where she received neurological testing and regular speech and occupational therapy until 1994. In mid-1993, Michael Schiavo requested a do not resuscitate order for her after she contracted a urinary tract infection.

==Legal cases 1992–2005==

===Malpractice===
In 1992, Michael filed a malpractice suit against Terri&#x27;s gynecologist on the basis that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri&#x27;s friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys&#x27; fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri&#x27;s medical care. According to Michael, in early 1993 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.

===Petition to remove feeding tube===
On June 18, 1990, the court appointed Michael Schiavo as Terri Schiavo&#x27;s legal guardian; this appointment was not disputed by the Schindlers at the time. In May 1998, Michael Schiavo filed a petition to remove Terri Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube, which her parents opposed. Richard Pearse was appointed by the court as a second guardian &quot;ad litem&quot; (GAL), and on December 29, 1998, reported &quot;Dr. Jeffrey Karp&#x27;s opinion of the ward&#x27;s condition and prognosis is substantially shared among those physicians who have recently been involved in her treatment.&quot; Pearse concluded from Karp&#x27;s and Vincent Gambone&#x27;s diagnosis of &quot;Persistent Vegetative State&quot; that Schiavo was legally in a persistent vegetative state as defined by Florida Statutes, Title XLIV, Chapter 765, §101(12). This includes the &quot;absence of voluntary action&quot; and an &quot;inability to communicate or interact purposefully&quot;.

Pearse found that there was no possibility of improvement but that Michael Schiavo&#x27;s decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo&#x27;s estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael&#x27;s credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well, since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Terri Schiavo&#x27;s estate upon her death.

===Schiavo end-of-life wishes===
Given the lack of a living will, a trial was held before Pinellas County Judge George Greer during the week of January 24, 2000, to determine what Schiavo&#x27;s wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures. Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney George Felos, who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the Florida Supreme Court in 1990.

The trial included testimony from 18 witnesses regarding her medical condition and her end-of-life wishes. Michael Schiavo claimed that his wife would not want to be kept on a machine where her chance for recovery was minuscule. According to Abstract Appeal Trial Order, her parents &quot;claimed that Terri was a devout Roman Catholic who would not wish to violate the Church&#x27;s teachings on euthanasia by refusing nutrition and hydration.&quot; Judge Greer issued his order granting the petition for authorization to discontinue artificial life support for Terri Schiavo in February 2000. In this decision, the court found that Terri Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state and that she had made reliable oral declarations that she would have wanted the feeding tube removed. This decision was upheld by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal (2nd DCA) and came to be known by the court as &quot;Schiavo I&quot; in its later rulings.

===Oral feeding and the second guardianship challenge===
In March 2000, the Schindlers filed a motion to permit assisted feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to swallowing tests and required a feeding tube, Judge Greer ruled that she was not capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.

In 2000, the Schindlers again challenged Michael Schiavo&#x27;s guardianship. The Schindlers suggested that he was wasting the assets within the guardianship account by transferring Terri Schiavo to a Pinellas Park, Florida, hospice &quot;after it was clear that she was not &#x27;terminal&#x27; within Medicare guidelines&quot; for hospices. By this time, while still legally married to Terri Schiavo, Michael Schiavo was in a relationship with Jodi Centonze, and had fathered their first child. He said he chose not to divorce his wife and relinquish guardianship because he wanted to ensure her final wishes (not to be kept alive in a PVS) were carried out. The court denied the motion to remove the guardian, allowing that the evidence was not sufficient and, in some instances, not relevant. It set April 24, 2001, as the date on which the tube was to be removed.

===&quot;Schiavo II&quot;===
In April 2001, the Schindlers filed a motion for relief from judgment citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo&#x27;s wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The Second District Court of Appeal upheld Greer&#x27;s decision but remanded the issue in order to give the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001, Terri&#x27;s feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada&#x27;s order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo filed a motion to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida&#x27;s Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as &quot;Schiavo II&quot; in its later rulings.

===&quot;Schiavo III and IV&quot;: PVS diagnosis challenge===

On August 10, 2001, on remand from the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers claiming that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself would be able to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001, the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo&#x27;s wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo&#x27;s condition. These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as &quot;Schiavo III&quot; in its later rulings. In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer&#x27;s court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: William Hammesfahr, Ronald Cranford, Melvin Greer and Peter Bambakidis.

The five doctors examined Terri Schiavo&#x27;s medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Terri herself. Cranford, Greer, and Bambakidis testified that Terri Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). Maxfield and Hammesfahr testified that she was in a minimally conscious state. As part of the court-ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Terri Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri &quot;clearly does not consistently respond to her mother&quot;. From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six video clips intended to support their case, totaling less than six minutes, and released those clips to public websites. Judge Greer ruled that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS, and was beyond hope of significant improvement. The trial court order was particularly critical of Hammesfahr&#x27;s testimony, which claimed positive results in similar cases by use of vasodilation therapy, the success of which is unsupported in the medical literature. This ruling was later affirmed by Florida&#x27;s Second District Court of Appeal, which stated that &quot;this court has closely examined all of the evidence in the record&quot;, and &quot;we have ... carefully observed the video tapes in their entirety.&quot; The court concluded that &quot;if we were called upon to review the guardianship court&#x27;s decision &quot;de novo&quot;, we would still affirm it.&quot; This decision by the Second District Court of Appeals came to be known as &quot;Schiavo IV&quot; in later rulings.

Around the start of 2003, the Schindlers began to create more publicity by lobbying for their case to keep their daughter alive. On September 11, 2003, the Schindlers petitioned the court to forestall removal of the feeding tube in order to provide for &quot;eight weeks&#x27; therapy&quot;. Accompanying the petition were four affidavits from members of the Schindler family and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon. At the hearing, the Schindlers&#x27; counsel read into the record additional affidavits from three speech professionals and two nurses. In particular, nurse Carla Sauer Iyer asserted that she was able to feed Terri Schiavo orally but that Michael characterized any such interaction as &quot;therapy&quot; and ordered her not to do so. Iyer claimed in her affidavit that her initial training in 1996 consisted solely of the instruction, &quot;Do what Michael Schiavo tells you or you&#x27;re terminated&quot;, and that standing orders were not to contact the Schindler family, but that she &quot;would call them anyway&quot;.

On September 17, 2003, Judge George Greer denied the petition, and wrote that &quot;the Petition is an attempt by Mr. and Mrs. Schindler to re-litigate the entire case. It is not even a veiled or disguised attempt. The exhibits relied upon by them, clearly demonstrate this to be true.&quot; Regarding Iyer&#x27;s statements, Greer wrote that they were &quot;incredible to say the least&quot; and that &quot;Ms. Iyer details what amounts to a 15-month cover-up from April 1995 through July 1996, which include the staff of Palm Garden of Largo Convalescent Center, the Guardian of the Person, the guardian &quot;ad litem&quot;, the medical professionals, the police and, believe it or not, Mr. and Mrs. Schindler ... It is impossible to believe that Mr. and Mrs. Schindler would not have subpoenaed Ms. Iyer for the January 2000 evidentiary hearing had Iyer contacted them in 1996 as her affidavit alleges.&quot;

==Terri&#x27;s Law and other government delays==
On October 15, 2003, Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube was removed. Within a week, when the Schindlers&#x27; final appeal was exhausted, State Rep. Frank Attkisson and the Florida Legislature passed &quot;Terri&#x27;s Law&quot; in an emergency session giving Governor Jeb Bush the authority to intervene in the case. Governor Bush immediately ordered the feeding tube be reinserted. Governor Bush sent the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to remove Schiavo from the hospice. She was taken to Morton Plant Rehabilitation Hospital in Clearwater, where her feeding tube was surgically reinserted. She was then returned to the hospice. Part of the legislation required the appointment of a guardian &quot;ad litem&quot; (GAL), Jay Wolfson, to &quot;deduce and represent the best wishes and best interests&quot; of Schiavo, and report them to Governor Bush. Wolfson&#x27;s report did not change Michael&#x27;s role as her legal guardian and did not otherwise obstruct him legally.

Michael Schiavo opposed the Governor&#x27;s intervention in Schiavo&#x27;s case, and was represented, in part, by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). At the same time, Robert and Mary Schindler, her parents, attempted to intervene and participate in the &quot;Terri&#x27;s Law&quot; case but were denied by Judge W. Douglas Baird, a Circuit Judge in the Florida Sixth Circuit. They appealed, and, on February 13, 2004, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal (Second District Court of Appeals) ordered Baird to hold further hearings on the issue. On March 17, 2004, Baird denied the Schindlers the right to intervene a second time. The Schindlers, represented by the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), appealed the right to participate in the &quot;Terri&#x27;s Law&quot; case, with the court scheduling an oral argument date for June 14. The Schindlers&#x27; other attorney, Pat Anderson, was concurrently challenging Michael Schiavo&#x27;s right to be her guardian, and, on June 16, 2004, she made a petition for writ of &quot;quo warranto&quot;.

On May 5, 2004, Baird found &quot;Terri&#x27;s Law&quot; unconstitutional, and struck it down. Bush appealed this order to the Second District Court of Appeals, but on May 12, 2004, the court issued an &quot;Order Relinquishing Case for Entry of Final Judgment and Order to Show Cause Why this Proceeding Should Not be Certified to the Supreme Court As Requiring Immediate Resolution&quot;. The Second District Court of Appeals, in sending it directly to the Florida Supreme Court, invoked &quot;pass through&quot; jurisdiction.

The Florida Supreme Court then overturned the law as unconstitutional.

==Final feeding tube removal and federal involvement==

===Early 2005 motions===
On February 23, 2005, the Schindlers filed a motion for relief from judgment pending medical evaluations. The Schindlers wanted Schiavo to be tested with an fMRI and given a swallowing therapy called VitalStim. The motion was accompanied by 33 affidavits from doctors in several specialties, speech-language pathologists and therapists, and a few neuropsychologists, all urging that new tests be undertaken. Patricia Fields Anderson, the Schindler family attorney, still held out hope &quot;that Terri might be able to take nourishment orally, despite past findings that she is incapable&quot;. Judge Greer formally denied the motion and ordered the &quot;removal of nutrition and hydration from the ward&quot; and set the time and date for the removal of the feeding tube as &quot;1:00 p.m. on Friday, March 18, 2005&quot;.

On February 28, 2005, the Schindlers filed a motion, asking for permission to attempt to provide Schiavo with &quot;Food and Water by Natural Means&quot;. This second motion asked for permission to &quot;attempt to feed&quot; Schiavo by mouth. Judge Greer denied the second motion on March 8, saying &quot;it has become clear that the second motion is part and parcel of the previous motion on medical evaluations. The same declarations are being used for both motions and the motion appears to be an alternative pleading to the previous motion. Both are asking for an experimental procedure.&quot; The following day, Greer denied the first motion as well, citing that an affiant doctor for Michael cautioned that fMRI was an experimental procedure that should be conducted in an academic setting, because Schiavo had already undergone swallowing tests and failed, and because VitalStim had only been performed on patients who were not in a PVS. Greer noted that &quot;most of the doctor affidavits submitted are based on their understanding of Schiavo&#x27;s condition from news reports or video clips they have seen. Many are obviously not aware of the medical exams undertaken for the 2002 trial.&quot;

Following Greer&#x27;s order on March 18, 2005, to remove the feeding tube, Republicans in the United States Congress subpoenaed both Michael and Terri Schiavo to testify at a congressional hearing. Greer told congressional attorneys, &quot;I have had no cogent reason why the (congressional) committee should intervene.&quot; He also stated that last-minute action by Congress does not invalidate years of court rulings.

===Palm Sunday Compromise===

President George W. Bush and Congressional Republicans anticipated Greer&#x27;s adverse ruling well before it was delivered and worked on a daily basis to find an alternative means of overturning the legal process by utilizing the authority of the United States Congress. On March 20, 2005, the Senate, by unanimous consent, passed their version of a relief bill; since the vote was taken by voice vote, there was no official tally of those voting in favor and those opposed. Soon after Senate approval, the House of Representatives passed an identical version of the bill S.686, which came to be called the &quot;Palm Sunday Compromise&quot; and transferred jurisdiction of the Schiavo case to the federal courts. The bill passed the House on March 21, 2005, at 12:41 a.m. (UTC−5). Bush flew to Washington, D.C. from his vacation in Texas in order to sign the bill into law at 1:11 a.m.

While the bill had been proposed by Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Mel Martínez, it also had the support of Democratic Senator Tom Harkin due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case, they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin&#x27;s support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.

As in the state courts, all of the Schindlers&#x27; federal petitions and appeals were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant &quot;certiorari&quot;, effectively ending the Schindlers&#x27; judicial options. At the same time, the so-called Schiavo memo surfaced, causing a political firestorm. The memo was written by Brian Darling, the legal counsel to Florida Republican senator Mel Martínez. It suggested the Schiavo case offered &quot;a great political issue&quot; that would appeal to the party&#x27;s base (core supporters) and could be used against Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, because he had refused to co-sponsor the bill. Nelson easily won re-election in 2006.

Republican majority leader and physician Bill Frist opposed the removal of her feeding tube and, in a speech delivered on the Senate floor, challenged the diagnosis of Schiavo&#x27;s physicians of Schiavo being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS): &quot;I question it based on a review of the video footage which I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office.&quot; After her death, the autopsy showed signs of long-term and irreversible damage to her brain consistent with PVS. Frist defended his actions after the autopsy.

==Final local motions, death, autopsy, and burial==
On March 24, 2005, Judge Greer denied a petition for intervention by the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) and signed an order forbidding the department from &quot;taking possession of Theresa Marie Schiavo or removing her&quot; from the hospice and directed &quot;each and every and singular sheriff of the state of Florida&quot; to enforce his order. The order was appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals the following day, which resulted in an automatic stay under state law. While the stay was in effect, Florida Department of Law Enforcement personnel prepared to take custody of Terri Schiavo and transfer her to a local hospital for reinsertion of the feeding tube. Once Greer was made aware of the stay, he ordered it lifted and all parties stood down. Governor Bush decided to obey the court order despite enormous pressure from the political right. If Bush (or the Florida Legislature) had ignored Greer&#x27;s order by attempting to remove her from the hospice, a confrontation between the Pinellas Park Police Department and the FDLE agents could have ensued. In jest, one official said local police discussed &quot;whether we had enough officers to hold off the National Guard.&quot;

Terri Schiavo died at a Pinellas Park hospice on March 31, 2005.

===Autopsy===
Schiavo&#x27;s body was taken to the Office of the District 6 Medical Examiner for Pinellas and Pasco counties, based in Largo, Florida. The autopsy was conducted on April 1, 2005, and revealed extensive brain damage. The manner of death was certified as &quot;undetermined.&quot; The autopsy was led by Chief Medical Examiner Jon R. Thogmartin. In addition to consultation with a neuropathologist (Stephen J. Nelson), Thogmartin also arranged for specialized cardiac and genetic examinations to be made. The official autopsy report was released on June 15, 2005. In addition to studying Terri Schiavo&#x27;s remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo&#x27;s nervous system by neuropathologist Stephen J. Nelson, revealed extensive injury. The brain itself weighed only , only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, due to the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the midbrain. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal neurons that comprise some 70% of cortical cells – critical to the functioning of the cortex – were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen from the front of the cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalamus) – another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, &quot;irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons.&quot;

The cardiac pathologist who studied Schiavo&#x27;s heart found it and the coronary vessels to be healthy, which excludes the possibility that her initial collapse was the result of myocardial infarction, although there was a localized area of healed inflammation (opening the possibility of myocarditis). Thogmartin found that &quot;there was no proof that Terri Schiavo ever had an eating disorder such as bulimia.&quot; Regarding the possibility of strangulation or domestic violence as a cause of Schiavo&#x27;s initial collapse, the report states: &quot;No trauma was noted on any of the numerous physical exams or radiographs performed on Mrs. Schiavo on the day of, in the days after, or in the months after her initial collapse. Indeed, within an hour of her initial hospital admission, radiographic examination of her cervical spine was negative. Specifically, external signs of strangulation including cutaneous or deep neck injury, facial/conjunctival petechiae, and other blunt trauma were not observed or recorded during her initial hospital admission. Autopsy examination of her neck structures 15 years after her initial collapse did not detect any signs of remote trauma, but, with such a delay, the exam was unlikely to show any residual neck findings.&quot;

Regarding the cause and manner of Schiavo&#x27;s death, Thogmartin wrote, &quot;Mrs. Schiavo suffered severe anoxic brain injury. The cause of which cannot be determined with reasonable medical certainty. The manner of death will therefore be certified as undetermined.&quot;

===Burial===
Schiavo&#x27;s body was cremated. Her parents organized a memorial Mass for her at the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church in Gulfport on April 5, 2005. Father Frank Pavone, the founder of the Priests for Life anti-abortion organization, delivered the homily.

Michael Schiavo had his wife&#x27;s cremated remains interred in a cemetery on June 20, 2005. The Schindlers&#x27; attorney stated that the family was notified by fax only after the memorial service; by then, the family had already started getting calls from reporters. The ashes were interred at Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park in Clearwater, Florida.

The epitaph (pictured) reads:

==Ethical and legal issues==
===Right to die===
The Schiavo case has been compared to the Karen Ann Quinlan case and Nancy Cruzan case, two landmark right-to-die cases. Quinlan entered a persistent vegetative state in 1975, and her family was allowed to remove her from a ventilator in 1976 after a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court based on her right of privacy. She died of pneumonia in 1985. Cruzan was diagnosed with PVS in 1983 and her legal case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; of her wishes to die under such circumstances was needed. Cruzan&#x27;s family did not have enough evidence of that, but later produced more. She died after being removed from life support in 1990.

The &quot;Terri Schiavo case&quot; actually refers to a series of cases. It differed from the Quinlan and Cruzan cases by involving settled law rather than breaking new legal ground on the right-to-die issue. In 2006, Professor Lois Shepherd, PhD JD, states it was &quot;unclear&quot; whether the Schiavo case represents a landmark decision. The Terri Schiavo affair involved a dispute between family members and her legal guardian over her wishes when there is no documented desire. According to medical ethicist Matthew Stonecipher, &quot;The movement to challenge the decisions made for Terri Schiavo threatened to destabilize end-of-life law that had developed over the last quarter of the 20th century, principally through the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan.&quot; The outcome of the Schiavo case was also in part determined by a 1990 Florida case, &quot;Guardianship of Estelle Browning&quot;. In that case, attorney George Felos, representing a Browning relative, successfully argued that Browning&#x27;s feeding tube should be removed before the Florida Supreme Court. The elderly Browning had expressed, in a living will, her wish not to be kept alive by any artificial means, including receiving food and water &quot;by a gastric tube or intravenously.&quot; At that time, it was common to remove people from ventilators, but the law in Florida was not clear on removing them from feeding tubes. In a landmark ruling, the Florida Supreme Court decided that Browning had &quot;the constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right extends to all relevant decisions concerning one&#x27;s health.&quot;

===Disability rights===
During the years of legal proceedings, disability rights groups and activists closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, 12 disability rights groups, led by Not Dead Yet, along with four other &quot;amici&quot; filed an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube. They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent.
They argued that persistent vegetative state is frequently misdiagnosed, and that the reasons for withdrawal of life support from a patient should be scrutinized since even family member surrogates can have conflicts of interest. The Palm Sunday Compromise granted the federal review they sought, but it was limited to only the Schiavo case.

==Public opinion and activism==
The seven-year case generated a great deal of public attention and activism. There was extensive media coverage and both sides courted public opinion. In 2000, the Schindlers created the Terri Schindler-Schiavo Foundation to garner support. During the weeks when Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube was removed in 2005, activists kept up an around-the-clock vigil outside her hospice. The protests were described as loud but non-violent. There were dozens of arrests, with most being for crossing a police line with water for Schiavo.

Two polls conducted shortly after Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube was removed for the final time in 2005 showed that a large majority of Americans believed that Michael Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife and that the U.S. Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case.

==Developments since Schiavo&#x27;s death==
Since Terri Schiavo&#x27;s death in March 2005, her family and Michael Schiavo have clashed a number of times. Each side has also worked to promote their own causes related to the case. In April 2005, the families disagreed over Schiavo&#x27;s burial. The Schindlers had wanted her body to be buried in Florida, while Michael Schiavo said at the time that he would cremate her body and then have her ashes buried in her home state of Pennsylvania. In June 2005, however, Schiavo&#x27;s ashes were buried in Florida instead. The words &quot;I kept my promise&quot; were included on the marker, referring to his promise to follow what he said was her wish not to be kept alive artificially. The statement angered the Schindlers.

In December 2005, Michael Schiavo created a political action committee, TerriPAC. It was formed to raise money to support right-to-die candidates and oppose candidates who had voted for government involvement in the Schiavo case. In 2007, TerriPAC paid a $1,350 fine to the Federal Election Commission for failing to file complete and timely records. Schiavo shut down the PAC later that year.

The Schindlers continued operation of the Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation, with a new goal of helping individuals in situations similar to Terri&#x27;s. In April 2010, Michael Schiavo charged that the Schindlers were improperly using Terri&#x27;s name, as he held the rights to it, and that the family was using the foundation in order to make money. A Florida television station looked at the foundation&#x27;s tax records and found that for 2008, it paid 64% of the $91,568 it raised in salaries to Terri&#x27;s father, Robert Schindler Sr., her sister, Suzanne Vitadamo, and her brother, Robert Schindler Jr. Their attorney said the foundation does its work effectively and that the high percentage for salaries was due to the small amount of money the foundation raises. He also said that the Schindlers had the right to use Terri&#x27;s name as she is a public figure. The foundation had been fined $1,000 shortly before Schiavo&#x27;s death for failing to file timely paperwork. In September 2010, the Schindlers renamed the organization the &quot;Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network&quot;. (Page headers in the web publication show the name change occurred in 2010, compare volume 1 to 2 for 2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;life &amp; hope Volume 2 / 1st Edition&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;life &amp; hope Volume 2 / 2nd Edition&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, both Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers released books telling their sides of the story. Schiavo&#x27;s was called &quot;Terri: The Truth&quot;, while the Schindlers&#x27; was titled &quot;A Life that Matters: The Legacy of Terri Schiavo – A Lesson for Us All&quot;.

Despite the extended emotion-laden legal struggle, the case broke no new legal ground: it remains settled law that the spouse is the next of kin in decisions where the patient is incompetent. However, it is now more generally recognized that the next of kin&#x27;s decisions should be carried out in a timely fashion, even on matters of life and death. The case has raised public awareness of the value of having an advance medical directive.

At the ten-year anniversary of Schiavo&#x27;s death, several news sources offered retrospectives on the case, some still attempting to explain how this particular case became so notable.

===Schiavo memo===
During the Terri Schiavo case in March 2005, a talking points memo on the controversy was written by Brian Darling, the legal counsel to Republican Senator Mel Martínez of Florida. The memo suggested the Schiavo case offered &quot;a great political issue&quot; that would appeal to the party&#x27;s base and could be used against Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida who was up for reelection in 2006, because he had refused to co-sponsor the bill which came to be known as the Palm Sunday Compromise.

Martínez stated that he had not read the memo before he inadvertently passed it to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, a Democratic supporter of the Palm Sunday Compromise legislation which gave federal courts jurisdiction to review the Terri Schiavo case.

After the existence of the memo was reported by ABC News and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist denounced the memo and asserted that the Republican Party&#x27;s interest in the case was solely based on moral grounds. Darling remained silent about his authorship of the memo as commentators from the conservative magazine &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; and other publications questioned its authenticity. The source of the memo had not been disclosed by either ABC News or &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; says that it neither implied that the memo originated from a Republican source nor that it was circulated by Republicans, though it did in fact make these assertions when it published the story by reporters Mike Allen and Manuel Roig-Franzia on its wire service on March 19, 2005. The authorship claim was removed before publication of the print version on March 20, 2005. On April 6, 2005, Darling admitted to writing the memo, and resigned his position as legal counsel to Senator Martínez.

<text>Sami Tuomas Hyypiä (; born 7 October 1973) is a Finnish professional football manager and a former player who played as a centre-back.

Hyypiä began his playing career with Ykkönen side Kumu and soon moved to Veikkausliiga outfit MyPa. He spent four years at the club, helping them win the Finnish Cup in 1992 and 1995. He moved to Willem II in 1995 and spent the next four years there. He became the team captain and was nominated their player of the year after helping them qualify for the UEFA Champions League.

In 1999, he moved to Liverpool, the team he supported as a child, in a deal worth £2.6 million. He quickly established himself in the first team, partnering Stéphane Henchoz in defence. By 2001, he regularly captained the team and that season Liverpool won a slew of honours, completing a cup treble of the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup, in addition to winning the UEFA Super Cup and FA Community Shield. He became first choice captain in the 2001–02 season and was part of the Football League Cup-winning team in 2003. Steven Gerrard superseded him as captain in 2003, but Hyypiä still occasionally captained the side in his absence. Hyypiä won his highest football honour in 2005 as part of Liverpool&#x27;s victorious 2004–05 Champions League campaign, where his defensive partnership with Jamie Carragher helped them win in the final. During his ten years in Merseyside, he became a fan favourite and remains a popular figure at the club. From 2009 to 2011, Hyypiä played for German Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, where he retired as a player in 2011.

Hyypiä was a prominent figure in the Finland national team and was selected as the Finnish Sports&#x27; Journalists and Football Association Player of the Year numerous times. He made his debut in 1992 and, with 105 caps before retiring in 2010, is the country&#x27;s third most capped Finnish player after Jari Litmanen and Teemu Pukki.

From the 2012–13 season, he returned to Bayer Leverkusen as its full team manager. After two successful seasons in the Bundesliga, he returned to English football in 2014 for a brief spell as manager of now Premier League club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. From August 2015 to May 2016, he was manager of Swiss club Zürich.

Hyypiä was named in the Finnish Sports Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Early life==
Hyypiä was born in Porvoo and raised in Kuusankoski, Finland, north-east of Helsinki, the son of Irma and Jouko Hyypiä. Hyypiä&#x27;s parents were both footballers – his father Jouko played for Finnish team Pallo Peikot, while his mother played as an amateur goalkeeper. Although the young Sami played ice hockey, one of the more popular sports in Finland, his parents&#x27; influence was important in him choosing a career in football; he later commented, &quot;I guess there was only one career option for me.&quot;

==Club career==

===Early career===
Hyypiä started his career with Pallo-Peikot, where he played every position except his final position of defender and KuMu, before joining Veikkausliiga club MyPa for the 1992 season. He won the Finnish Cup with MyPa in 1992, when Jari Litmanen was one of his teammates, and again in 1995.

In 1995, at the age of 22, he went for a trial at Newcastle United, his first taste of English football. Hyypiä said: &quot;They [Newcastle] certainly helped my career. I had a two-week trial in 1995 under Kevin Keegan and it gave me an insight into English football. I was a young player in Finland and I didn&#x27;t really expect it to lead to anything. I just went for the experience, but it was good experience and I enjoyed my time there. It helped me a lot at the time to see a big English club at close hand and I always look forward to going back.&quot;

===Willem II===
Later that year, Hyypiä joined Dutch club Willem II and spent four years with the Eredivisie team, soon becoming a favourite with the fans and winning their player of the year award in his final season. Hyypiä captained the side to qualification for the UEFA Champions League, thus earning a place in the hearts of supporters although he would not be taking part in the campaign.

===Liverpool===
In May 1999, Hyypiä was signed by Liverpool, the team he supported as a boy, for £2.6 million, having been recommended to former chief executive Peter Robinson by a TV cameraman. Initially, Hyypiä was regarded as an unknown who would not live up to expectations, but this preconception was dismissed when he immediately formed a successful central defensive partnership with fellow arrival Stéphane Henchoz. Almost ten years later in a farewell tribute to Hyypiä, Ron Yeats, then the chief scout for Liverpool, commented that the deal was &quot;one of the best bits of business we&#x27;ve done over the years… a steal – a bargain…&quot; Fourteen years on, Hyypiä himself told the BBC that joining Liverpool was a dream come true.
In the 2000–01 season, Hyypiä shared the captaincy of Liverpool with Robbie Fowler while Jamie Redknapp, the full-time captain, was suffering from a long-term injury. During that season, Hyypiä and Fowler led the team to a cup treble: the Football League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup. He also went on to claim a &quot;treble&quot; of three consecutive FAF Finnish Footballer of the Year awards from 2001 to 2003.

In 2002, Hyypiä became first choice Liverpool captain after Redknapp, who had been blighted by long-term injuries, and Fowler both left the club. However, after such a bright start to his Liverpool career came a relative lull and in 2003, Hyypiä was replaced as Liverpool captain by Steven Gerrard. With some of the pressure lifted, his performances generally improved.

On 5 April 2003, Hyypiä received a red card against Manchester United, the only red of his club career. &quot;[Ruud] Van Nistelrooy was going through and maybe I took his shirt a little bit. The referee thought so. I got a straight red card. They got a penalty. It was an agony to watch the game in the dressing room. The only red card of my career. You remember that sort of thing.&quot;

In 2004, new Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez moved Jamie Carragher from fullback to partner Hyypiä in central defence. This seemingly reinvigorated Hyypiä and the team went on to have a successful season, winning the 2004–05 Champions League on the back of their solid defence. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Hyypiä had agreed to a new three-year contract after weeks of talks with the Reds which would keep him at Anfield until 2008.
During the 2005–06 season, Hyypiä was relegated to third-choice captain after Jamie Carragher&#x27;s ascent as Gerrard&#x27;s deputy on the field. In the FA Cup sixth round against Birmingham City, he scored the opening goal in the first minute as the Reds thrashed the home team 7–0. He started in the victorious 2006 FA Cup Final against West Ham United, though he missed his spot kick in the penalty shoot-out. During the season, he climbed into the top 25 in the club&#x27;s all-time appearances table after featuring in the League Cup against Arsenal in January 2007.

Despite speculation in the summer of 2007 linking him to various other Premier League teams, Hyypiä insisted that he would stay at Liverpool for the remainder of his contract. On 25 August 2007, Hyypiä broke his nose during an away match against Sunderland in the Stadium of Light. He quickly returned on the pitch to play against Toulouse in the Champions League qualifying match on 28 August 2007, in which he scored the second goal for Liverpool while wearing the captain&#x27;s armband in the absence of Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher.

In April 2008, Hyypiä signed a new deal until summer 2009, with Benítez stating he is a good role model for young defenders such as Martin Škrtel and Daniel Agger. The 2008–09 season marked the defender&#x27;s tenth season at the club. On 22 August 2008, Premier League newcomers Stoke City offered £2.5 million for Hyypiä, but Liverpool rejected the offer. On 2 March 2008, with his appearance against Bolton Wanderers, Hyypiä made it into the top 20 Liverpool player appearances of all time.

Hyypiä was voted in 19th place in Sky Sports&#x27; &quot;Top 50 Premier League Foreign Players&quot;, 45th in &quot;FourFourTwo&quot;″s 100 Greatest Foreign Players and 38th in Liverpool&#x27;s 100 Players Who Shook the Kop survey. Underlining the important role Hyypiä had fulfilled at Liverpool, Ian Rush noted: &quot;He&#x27;s got to be up there with the best signings the club has ever made.&quot;

In September 2008, Hyypiä was not included in the 25-man Liverpool squad for the group stages of the Champions League, as new UEFA regulations meant that clubs had to include at least eight home-grown players in their squad.
On 4 May 2009, it was announced that Hyypiä had signed two-year contract with German Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen. Liverpool had offered him the chance to stay at Anfield in a coaching capacity, but Hyypiä decided to carry on playing, though he expressed interest in returning to Liverpool as a coach once his playing career concluded.

Hyypiä played his last match for Liverpool at Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur on 24 May 2009, coming on as a substitute to replace captain Steven Gerrard after 84 minutes in their 3–1 win. Gerrard passed the captain&#x27;s armband to him, personally putting it onto Hyypiä&#x27;s arm. During what remained of the match, Hyypiä managed to get a header from a corner kick in the dying minutes of the game, but the attempt was blocked by Heurelho Gomes. After the match ended, an emotional Hyypiä received a standing ovation from Liverpool fans and his teammates held him aloft. Hyypiä made 464 appearances and scored 35 goals, winning ten trophies in the ten years he was at Liverpool.

===Bayer Leverkusen===
Hyypiä moved to Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen during summer 2009, making his official debut on 8 August against Mainz 05. On 24 January 2010, he scored his first Bundesliga goal in a 3–0 win over 1899 Hoffenheim. Hyypiä&#x27;s first season with Bayer Leverkusen saw his club finishing fourth overall, missing by two points the qualification round for the 2010–11 Champions League campaign. German sports magazine &quot;kicker&quot; chose Hyypiä as best Bundesliga defender in 2009, and he was included Bundesliga Team of the Year for 2009–10.

After Roy Hodgson was appointed as the new Liverpool manager in August 2010, rumours began to circulate that he was determined to bring Hyypiä back to Liverpool. However, the transfer fell through as reportedly Hodgson could not get Hyypiä out of his contract with Leverkusen. On 25 September 2010, Hyypiä scored his third ever Bundesliga goal with a header against VfB Stuttgart in a 4–1 win.

Hyypiä made public on 6 October 2010 that, post-retirement, he planned to join Leverkusen as assistant manager. On 2 May 2011, he announced his retirement from playing professional football. Hyypiä appeared in more than 560 top-flight matches in Finland, the Netherlands, England and Germany.

==International career==
Hyypiä was capped 27 times by the Finland national under-21 team. He made his debut for the senior team against Tunisia on 7 November 1992 at the age of 19. He went on to be a key member of the Finnish squad, participating in five UEFA European Championship and four FIFA World Cup qualifiers. In a friendly against Sweden on 12 August 2009, he became one of four Finland national team players ever to reach milestone of 100 international appearances. Hyypiä succeeded Jari Litmanen as captain of the Finland national team in 2008. He was given a straight red card in his penultimate match for a 36th-minute foul on Viorel Frunza as Finland lost 2–0 away to Moldova in a qualifier. His last appearance for national team was against Hungary in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier on 12 October 2010, a 2–1 home defeat.

With a total of 105 matches, Hyypiä ranks in the summer of 2023 as fourth among all-time most capped Finnish players; only Jari Litmanen, Teemu Pukki and Jonatan Johannson have been capped more.

==Coaching career==

===Bayer Leverkusen===

Hyypiä became part of the coaching staff for both Finland national team and Bayer Leverkusen. He started a coaching formation at the Football Association of Finland. In October 2011, Hyypiä was in Leverkusen for six weeks as a trainee with the club&#x27;s then-head coach, Robin Dutt. On 1 April 2012, Hyypiä and under-19 coach Sascha Lewandowski were named as caretaker coaches of Leverkusen after the sacking of Dutt. On 15 May 2012, Hyypiä was confirmed as team manager and Lewandowski as head coach of Bayer Leverkusen until the summer of 2015. In an unusual managerial set-up, both were equally responsible for leading Bayer Leverkusen: as Lewandowski had the training licence, he had to be at post-match press conferences and took care of the training sessions. Meanwhile, Hyypiä watched them, intervened with personal talks and was at the pre-game press conferences. Despite his imperfect grasp of the German language, Hyypiä addressed the team before matches. This system proved successful: in the middle of the 2012–13 season, Leverkusen was second in the Bundesliga, were the only side to beat Bayern Munich at home and qualified for the next round in the Champions League, and the DFB-Pokal. Bayer Leverkusen ended the 2012–13 season in third place behind the champions Bayern and runners-up Borussia Dortmund. Hyypiä became the sole head coach after Lewandowski went back to work with the youth development department.

Hyypiä&#x27;s first training session as the sole head coach occurred on 24 June 2013. Bayer Leverkusen ended the 2013–14 season in fourth place, behind Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04. On 5 April 2014, Hyypiä was sacked by Bayer Leverkusen with immediate effect after the club lost to Hamburger SV the night before.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 6 June 2014, Hyypiä was officially named manager of Football League Championship club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, signing a three-year contract. His reign as Brighton boss started with two successive 1–0 defeats, before tasting victory in his third game in charge. Results were poor, and on 22 December 2014, with the team in the relegation zone, Hyypiä offered his resignation as manager after a 1–1 draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers; Brighton chairman Tony Bloom announced that Hyypiä&#x27;s resignation was reluctantly accepted. Hyypiä&#x27;s decision to step down came after his side only managed one win in their previous 18 games, with the club securing six victories in his 26 in charge, three of which came in cup ties.

===Zürich===
On 21 August 2015, Hyypiä was officially announced as the manager of the Swiss Super League club Zürich. On 12 May 2016, Hyypiä was sacked as coach of Zürich after he had lost a vote of no confidence in the team. He left the club in last place with three rounds before the end of the season; Zürich were ultimately relegated to the Swiss second division, the Swiss Challenge League.

===Haka===
After taking a break from the game, he joined Finnish side Haka in 2020 as assistant manager, but left after just three months.

==Personal life==
In 2002, Hyypiä released an autobiography, &quot;From Voikkaa to the Premiership&quot;.

Hyypiä was married to Susanna between 2007 and 2022, when the couple divorced. He has two sons from his first marriage. Off the pitch, he is generally a private person and, although his ex-wife had been occasionally seen at his matches, their children rarely appear in public. He lived with his family near Pulheim near Cologne and had an English second home because of his time as manager of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

Since 2021, Hyypiä has been dating Finnish racing driver Emma Kimiläinen.

Hyypiä has set up a fund to help young promising athletes of his native Finland. As part of his efforts to raise funds, he participated in the Helsinki City Marathon, his first ever, on 20 August 2011, completing the course in a time of 3:56:09.

Hyypiä was named in the Finnish Football Hall of Fame in 2015, and in the Finnish Sports Hall of Fame on 11 January 2024.

<text>HP Autonomy, previously Autonomy Corporation PLC, was an enterprise software company which was merged with Micro Focus in 2017 and OpenText in 2023 (OpenText had acquired the content management assets of Autonomy in 2016). It was founded in Cambridge, United Kingdom in 1996.

Autonomy was acquired by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in October 2011. The deal valued Autonomy at $11.7 billion (£7.4 billion). Within a year, HP had written off $8.8 billion of Autonomy&#x27;s value. HP claimed this resulted from &quot;serious accounting improprieties&quot; and &quot;outright misrepresentations&quot; by the previous management. The former CEO, Mike Lynch, said that the problems were due to HP&#x27;s running of Autonomy.

HP recruited Robert Youngjohns, ex-Microsoft president of North America, to take over HP Autonomy in September 2012. In 2015, HP was split into HP Inc and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE); HP Autonomy assets were divided between them with HPE taking the larger part. HP Inc later sold its Autonomy content management assets to Canadian software company OpenText in 2016. In 2017, HPE sold its remaining Autonomy assets, as part of a wider deal, to the British software company Micro Focus. In 2023, OpenText acquired Micro Focus, and reunited the two halves of former Autonomy assets.

==History==

===Inception and expansion===
Autonomy was founded in Cambridge, England by Michael Lynch and Richard Gaunt in 1996 as a spin-off from Cambridge Neurodynamics, a firm specializing in computer-based fingerprint recognition. It used a combination of technologies born out of research at the University of Cambridge and developed a variety of enterprise search and knowledge management applications using adaptive pattern recognition techniques centered on Bayesian inference in conjunction with traditional methods. It maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach, and sales controls described as a &quot;rod of iron&quot; - allegedly firing the weakest 5% of its sales force each quarter whilst cosseting the best sales staff &quot;like rock stars&quot;.

Autonomy floated in 1998 on the EASDAQ exchange at a share price of approximately £0.30. At the height of the &quot;dot-com bubble&quot;, the peak share price was £30.

December 2005: Autonomy acquired Verity, Inc., one of its main competitors, for approximately US$500 million. In 2005 Autonomy also acquired Neurodynamics.

May 2007: After exercising an option to buy a stake in technology start up Blinkx Inc, and combining it with its consumer division, Autonomy floated Blinkx on a valuation of $250 million.

July 2007: Autonomy acquired Zantaz, an email archiving and litigation support company, for $375 million.

October 2007: Autonomy acquired Meridio Holdings Ltd, a UK company based in Northern Ireland that specialised in Records Management software, for £20 million.

28 May 2008: Kainos extended its partnership with Autonomy for high-end information processing and Information Risk Management (IRM) to deliver information governance solutions to its customer base.

January 2009: Autonomy acquired Interwoven, a niche provider of enterprise content management software, for $775 million. Interwoven became Autonomy Interwoven and Autonomy iManage.

In 2009 Paul Morland, a leading analyst, started raising concerns about Autonomy&#x27;s exaggerated performance claims.

June 2010: Autonomy announced that it was to acquire the Information Governance business of CA Technologies. Terms of the sale were not disclosed.

5 May 2011: The Mercedes Formula One team announced an $8 million sponsorship deal with Autonomy, and on 8 July 2010 Tottenham Hotspur FC announced a two-year sponsorship deal with Autonomy for their Premier League kit. For the 2011–12 season Spurs&#x27; Premier League shirt featured Autonomy&#x27;s augmented reality technology Aurasma.

16 May 2011: Autonomy acquired Iron Mountain Digital, a pioneer in E-discovery and online backup solutions provider, for $380 million from Iron Mountain Incorporated.

On 18 August 2011, Hewlett-Packard announced that it would purchase Autonomy for US$42.11 per share with a premium of around 79% over market price that was widely criticized as &quot;absurdly high&quot;, a &quot;botched strategy shift&quot; and a &quot;chaotic&quot; attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings by expanding the high-margin software services sector. The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both HP and Autonomy and the Autonomy board recommended that its shareholders accept the offer. On 3 October 2011 HP closed the deal, announcing that it had acquired around 87.3% of the shares for around $10.2 billion, and valuing the company at around $11.7 billion in total.

On 10 January 2012, legal entity Autonomy Corporation PLC was converted into private company Autonomy Corporation Limited.

In May 2012, Mike Lynch left his role as Autonomy CEO after a significant drop in revenue in the previous quarter.

In September 2012, Robert Youngjohns was appointed SVP &amp; GM of Autonomy/Information Management Business Unit.

In November 2012, Hewlett-Packard announced that it was taking an $8.8 billion accounting charge after claiming &quot;serious accounting improprieties&quot; and &quot;outright misrepresentations&quot; at Autonomy; its share price fell to a decades&#x27; low on the news. Previous management in turn accused HP of a &quot;textbook example of defensive stalling&quot;  to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company, noting public awareness since 2009 of its financial reporting issues and that even HP&#x27;s CFO disagreed with the price paid. External observers stated that only a small part of the write-off appeared to be due to accounting mis-statements, and that HP had overpaid for businesses previously. Lynch said that the problems were due to HP&#x27;s running of Autonomy, citing &quot;internecine warfare&quot; within the organization. Major culture clashes had been reported in the press.

The Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom), and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission joined the FBI in investigating the potential anomalies. In January 2015, the SFO closed its investigation as the chance of successful prosecution was low.

Three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against HP, for the fall in value of HP shares. In August 2014, a United States district court judge threw out a proposed settlement involving a fee of up to $48 million: Autonomy&#x27;s previous management had argued the settlement would be collusive and was intended to divert scrutiny of HP executives&#x27; own responsibility and knowledge.

 In November 2013, the HP Exstream customer communication management (CCM) business, formerly part of the HP LaserJet and Enterprise Solutions (LES) business, joined the HP Autonomy organization.

On 30 January 2014, the company announced that one of its partners, Kainos, had integrated HP IDOL 10.5, the new version of HP Autonomy&#x27;s information analytics engine, into Kainos&#x27;s electronic medical record platform, Evolve.

On 31 October 2015, Autonomy&#x27;s software products were divided between HP Inc (HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as a result of the Hewlett-Packard Company separation. HP Inc was assigned ownership largely consisting of Autonomy&#x27;s content management software components including TeamSite, Qfiniti, Qfiniti Managed Services, MediaBin, Optimost, and Explore. Hewlett Packard Enterprise retained ownership of the remaining software and legal entity of Autonomy Corporation Limited.

=== Acquisition by Micro Focus and OpenText ===
2 May 2016: OpenText acquired HP TeamSite, HP MediaBin, HP Qfiniti, HP Explore, HP Aurasma, and HP Optimost from HP Inc for $170 million.

In 2017, HPE sold its Autonomy assets, as part of a wider deal valued at $8.8 billion, to the British software company Micro Focus. Micro Focus acquired the operating subsidiary Autonomy Systems Limited and related foreign subsidiaries on 1 September 2017. Legal entity and former parent company Autonomy Corporation Limited was merged with fellow HPE subsidiary ACL Netherlands B.V. and ceased to exist.

In April 2018 Autonomy&#x27;s ex-CFO Sushovan Hussain was charged in the US and found guilty in of accounting fraud, and subsequently allowed out on bail after his appeal raised a &quot;substantial question over his conviction.&quot; Hussain&#x27;s appeal failed in August 2020.

Based on Hussain&#x27;s evidence, Lynch was charged with fraud in November 2018. Lynch said he would contest extradition and that he &quot;vigorously rejects all the allegations against him.&quot;

In March 2019, HP brought a civil action in the UK courts. The case was heard in a trial lasting 93 days, with Lynch present in the witness box for 22 days, making it one of the longest cross-examinations in British legal history. In January 2022, the High Court in London ruled that HP had &quot;substantially won&quot; its civil case against Lynch and Hussain in which HP claimed that the two individuals had &quot;artificially inflated Autonomy&#x27;s reported revenues, revenue growth and gross margins&quot;.

In September 2020, Deloitte, who audited Autonomy between 2009 and 2011, were fined £15m for its audits that contained “serious and serial failures”.

In August 2022, OpenText announced that it would acquire Micro Focus in a deal valued at US$6billion. The acquisition was approved by the court on 27 January 2023, the transaction was completed on 31 January 2023.

<doc id="670920" wikidata="Q3497227" url="?curid=670920" title="Huntsville Stars">
<text>The Huntsville Stars were a Minor League Baseball team that played in Huntsville, Alabama, from 1985 to 2014. They competed in the Southern League as the Double-A affiliate of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Oakland Athletics from 1985 to 1998 and Milwaukee Brewers from 1999 to 2014. The Stars played their home games at Joe W. Davis Stadium and were named for the space industry with which Huntsville is economically tied (NASA conducts operations at the nearby Marshall Space Flight Center).

The team began play in 1985 after a Southern League franchise operating in Nashville, Tennessee, as the Nashville Sounds, was transferred to Huntsville. They remained in the city for 30 years before being relocated to Biloxi, Mississippi, where they became known as the Biloxi Shuckers, after the 2014 season.

Over the course of playing in 4,211 regular season games and compiling a win–loss record of 2,112–2,099, Huntsville reached the postseason on 14 occasions, winning 13 half-season titles, 10 division titles, and 3 Southern League championships. They won their first league championship in their inaugural 1985 season as an affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. They won a second with Oakland in 1994 and a third in 2001 with the Milwaukee Brewers.

== History ==
=== Coming to Huntsville ===
In July 1984, Larry Schmittou, president of the Nashville Sounds of the Double-A Southern League, and other members of the team&#x27;s ownership group purchased the Evansville Triplets of the Triple-A American Association with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. He wanted to send Nashville&#x27;s existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league&#x27;s disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama. The city, led by Mayor Joe W. Davis, agreed to build a brand new 10,000-seat multipurpose stadium which lured the franchise to town where it began play in 1985 as the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded it, while the Stars were established as an entirely new franchise. Schmittou and several other Sounds shareholders owned the Stars, while Don Mincher, a Huntsville native and 12-year veteran of the major leagues, operated the team as its General Manager.

=== Oakland Athletics (1985–1998) ===

The Huntsville Stars became the Double-A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. Manager Brad Fischer guided the franchise to win the First Half Western Division title in their inaugural season. They then defeated the Knoxville Blue Jays, 3–1, in the Western Division finals on the way to winning their first Southern League championship in their first season by defeating the Charlotte O&#x27;s, 3–2. Outfielder Jose Canseco was selected as the Southern League Most Valuable Player (MVP).

In 1986, the Stars hosted the Southern League All-Star Game at Joe W. Davis Stadium on July 23. A team of Southern League All-Stars was defeated by the Nashville Sounds, 4–2. Huntsville catcher Terry Steinbach won the game&#x27;s MVP Award. The 1986 Stars repeated with another first half title and won the Western Division against the Knoxville Blue Jays, 3–1. They were defeated in the finals, however, by the Columbus Astros, 3–2. Steinbach won the league&#x27;s MVP Award. In 1987, they reached the postseason for the third consecutive season by winning the second half of the season, but fell to the Birmingham Barons, 3–0, in the Western Division finals. The 1988 club finished with a 59–85 (.410) record, the lowest in franchise history.

The 1989 Stars returned to the playoffs having won the second half, but were again defeated by Birmingham in the division finals, 3–1. Manager Jeff Newman was selected for the Southern League Manager of the Year Award. The team missed the postseason in both 1990 and 1991. In 1991, Huntsville hosted the first Double-A All-Star Game on July 10. A team of American League-affiliated All-Stars defeated a team of National League-affiliated All-Stars, 8–2. On August 3, 1992, pitchers Dana Allison, Roger Smithberg, and Todd Revering combined to pitch a 10-inning, 1–0 no-hitter against Birmingham. The Chattanooga Lookouts won both halves of the 1992 season, but Huntsville qualified for the postseason with the second-best overall record in the Western Division. They were defeated by the Lookouts, 3–1, in the division series. First baseman Marcos Armas was the MVP of 1992&#x27;s Double-A All-Star Game. On June 13, 1993, Tanyon Sturtze no-hit Chattanooga, 5–0.

Following the 1993 season, Larry Schmittou sold the Stars to Don Mincher and a group of Huntsville investors for an asking price between US$3.5 million and $4 million. After missing the playoffs in 1993, the Stars won the 1994 first half and then defeated Chattanooga for the Western Division title, 3–1. Huntsville won its second Southern League championship, 3–1, against the Carolina Mudcats. Manager of the Year Gary Jones&#x27; 1994 club set a franchise record with their 81–57 (.587) season.

The Stars did not return to the postseason until 1997. They won the second half before beating the Mobile BayBears, 3–2, to win the Western Division before ultimately losing the championship to the Greenville Braves, 3–2. Right fielder Ben Grieve was the league MVP, and shortstop Mike Coolbaugh won MVP honors at that summer&#x27;s Double-A All-Star Game. The 1998 team qualified for the playoffs with the second-best record behind Mobile, which had won both halves, but was swept, 3–0, by the BayBears in the Western Division finals.

After the 1998 season, the Oakland Athletics transferred their Double-A affiliation to the Midland RockHounds of the Texas League. Through 14 years with the Athletics, the Stars had amassed a record of 1,029–961 (.517).

=== Milwaukee Brewers (1999–2014) ===

After the Stars and Athletics parted ways, Huntsville became the Double-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. The Stars struggled in their first two seasons of the new affiliation, failing to win any half of the seasons.

In 2000, Mincher became Interim President of the Southern League when President Arnold Fielkow left for the National Football League. At the conclusion of the 2000 season, Mincher and his group put the Stars up for sale once again. He resigned from his position as President of the Stars, and the Southern League removed the &quot;interim&quot; tag to make him league president for 2001. Pulling double duty until the team was sold, Mincher desired to keep the Stars in Huntsville. The group waded through countless offers to buy the Stars looking to find the right investors who would commit to keeping the team in the Tennessee Valley. Early in 2001, Mincher found his man in New York attorney Miles Prentice who also owned the Midland RockHounds, served as a Director for the Texas League, and was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees for Minor League Baseball. Prentice promised to keep the team in Huntsville despite several offers for new stadiums in various locales.

The Stars returned to the playoffs in 2001. Winning the First Half Western Division title, the team went on to win the division against Birmingham, 3–2. The September 11 attacks prompted the cancellation of the championship series before it could begin. Both Huntsville and the Eastern Division champion Jacksonville Suns were declared co-champions. Third baseman Dave Gibralter won the MVP Award for that summer&#x27;s Double-A All-Star Game.

In 2003, the first-half champion Stars won the Western Division versus Birmingham, 3–2, but lost in the Southern League championship series to Carolina, 3–2. Third baseman Corey Hart won the Southern League MVP Award, and manager Frank Kremblas was the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year. Missing the playoffs in 2004 and 2005, they made another championship attempt in 2006, winning the second half, defeating Chattanooga, 3–0, for the Northern Division title, but losing the league crown to the Montgomery Biscuits, 3–1. In 2007, Stars manager Don Money was named the Southern League&#x27;s Manager of the Year. Also in 2007, the team captured the division title, beating the Tennessee Smokies, 3–2, but were again defeated by Montgomery in the finals, 3–2.

To start the 2008 season, the Stars set a new team record for best start, by sweeping their first series with the Mississippi Braves, 5–0. On April 26, 2008, the Stars turned their second triple play in franchise history, the last coming in 2002. David Welch pitched a 7-inning no-hitter against Chattanooga on June 2, 2008. The Stars won the 2009 first half title but lost the Northern Division to Tennessee, 3–1. Sub-.500 teams from 2010 to 2013 failed to reach the playoffs, the longest postseason drought in team history. During this stretch, however, Wily Peralta won the 2011 Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award and first baseman Hunter Morris won the 2012 MVP Award. On August 2, 2012, Jimmy Nelson, Dan Merklinger, R. J. Seidel, Darren Byrd, and Brandon Kintzler pitched a combined no-hitter against Chattanooga, a 3–1 win. Merklinger walked four batters in the fifth inning for the only Lookouts run of the game.

Prior to the 2014 season, an ownership group based in Biloxi, Mississippi, led by Ken Young purchased the team with the intention of relocating the club. The Stars played the 2014 season in Huntsville, while a new ballpark was built in Biloxi. In their 30th and final season in Huntsville, the Stars won the first half title, but lost in the Northern Division series to Chattanooga, 3–2. Over 16 years as a Brewers affiliate, Huntsville compiled a record of 1,083–1,138 (.488). The franchise&#x27;s composite record over their entire 30-year run stood at 2,112–2,099 (.502).

Because of delays in the construction of Biloxi&#x27;s MGM Park, the Biloxi Shuckers, as the team was named, played their first 54 games on the road, including 15 at Joe Davis Stadium in April and May 2015 before their June 6 home opener in Biloxi.

Second baseman/shortstop Scott Brosius, inducted in 2015, played for the Stars in 1989 and 1990, and led the Southern League in his second season with 162 hits, 274 total bases, and 39 doubles, earning him a spot on the 1990 postseason all-star team. He went on to an 11-year MLB career, winning three World Series and the 1998 World Series MVP Award with the New York Yankees. Larry Schmittou, who helped bring baseball to Huntsville in 1985 and was part owner of the Stars from 1985 to 1993, was inducted in 2016.

<text>Marlborough is a rural town and coastal locality in the Livingstone Shire, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Marlborough had a population of 154 people.

== Geography ==
The town lies on the Bruce Highway, north west of the city of Rockhampton. The town is a small service centre for the surrounding area, and one of a number of fuelling points on an otherwise isolated stretch of highway.

To the south lies the Kunwarara Magnesite mine, which works one of the world&#x27;s largest supplies of the mineral.

Marlborough is famous for producing the world&#x27;s finest chrysoprase, a semi-precious gem once coveted by Alexander the Great and Cleopatra. The small but high-grade deposit is located about south-south-west of the township and is universally regarded as the most valuable find in the world.

The Bruce Highway passes through the locality, entering from the east (Kunwarara) and exiting to the north-west (Ogmore), bypassing the town approx to the west. The North Coast railway line also passes through the locality, running roughly parallel to the east of the highway, but does pass through the town, which is served by Marlborough railway station ().

The Marlborough–Sarina Road exits to the west.

== History ==
Marlborough was established as a squatting pastoral run in 1857 by Dan Connor. The name is probably connected with the First Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722), a British army commander.

The post office at Marlborough opened on 1 January 1861. The first town allotments were sold in 1862. Marlborough was the location of a Native Police barracks from 1865 to 1876. The barracks were located at Barrack Creek on the northwest outskirts of the town.

Marlborough Railway Provisional School opened on 26 July 1917. On 26 April 1919 it was renamed Koonama Provisional School. On 18 October 1920 it became Koonama State School. On 11 September 1925 it was renamed Marlborough State School.

On 24 July 2000, five people were killed when the Rockhampton-based Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service helicopter crashed in a paddock at Marlborough while attempting to land in thick fog. Following the tragedy, the community of Marlborough raised enough money to establish a permanent helipad in the town in an attempt to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future.

Marlborough is within the local government area of Shire of Livingstone, but, between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Rockhampton Region.

<text>The Montgomery Biscuits are a Minor League Baseball team based in Montgomery, Alabama. They are the Double-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays and play in the Southern League. The team was founded in Orlando, Florida, in 1973 as the Orlando Twins, an affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. After remaining in the Minnesota minor league organization for 20 seasons, the team became an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs for four seasons and then the Seattle Mariners for one. In 1999, the team became an affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays, and they have remained in the organization ever since. They became members of the Double-A South in 2021, though this was renamed the Southern League in 2022.

Over the years, the club changed names several times. They were the Orlando Twins for 17 seasons, then were known as the SunRays, Cubs, and Rays. The club became known as the Biscuits when it moved from the Orlando area to Montgomery in 2004.

The club played at Tinker Field near downtown Orlando from 1973 until 2000, when they moved to Champion Stadium in nearby Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Since moving to Montgomery in 2004, the Biscuits have played at Montgomery Riverwalk Stadium, a 7,000-seat facility which was built for the club in the downtown area.

==Franchise history==

===Orlando===

The franchise joined the Southern League in 1973 as the Orlando Twins, a minor-league affiliate of the Minnesota Twins, which held spring training in Orlando, Florida at the time. The Orlando Twins played at Tinker Field in downtown Orlando, near the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium. In 1990, the team was renamed the Orlando Sun Rays. In 1993, the Chicago Cubs became the team&#x27;s new major-league affiliate, and the team was renamed the Orlando Cubs. While still a Chicago Cubs affiliate, the team renamed itself again in 1997 and became the Orlando Rays. The following year, for one season only, the Seattle Mariners were the Rays&#x27; major-league affiliate. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays, an American League expansion team in 1998, assumed the Orlando Rays&#x27; major-league affiliation the following year.

The Orlando Rays&#x27; last season at Tinker Field was 1999. From 2000 to 2003, the Orlando Rays played in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, in Champion Stadium at Walt Disney World Resort. Despite the fact that the team played in a state-of-the-art stadium that was built in 1997 and used during spring training by the Atlanta Braves, attendance did not meet expectations; after trailing the Southern League in attendance in multiple years, the Rays&#x27; owners announced the team would move to Montgomery in 2004 (terminating their 10-year lease with Disney after four seasons).

While in Orlando, the franchise won three Southern League championships: in 1981 (as the Twins), 1991 (as the Sun Rays), and 1999 (as the Rays).

===Montgomery===
The Biscuits became Montgomery&#x27;s first Major League Baseball-affiliated team since 1980, when the Montgomery Rebels, a Detroit Tigers affiliate, played their final season in the Southern League at Montgomery&#x27;s Paterson Field. The Biscuits&#x27; owners, Sherrie Myers and Tom Dickson, were selected from six different ownership groups during an extensive search for a public-private partner by the City of Montgomery. Myers and Dickson selected the team&#x27;s nickname from over 4,000 entries in a &quot;name the team&quot; contest, due in part to tying into indigenous affiliation and potential marketing and pun possibilities (for example, &quot;Hey, Butter, Butter, Butter&quot; or the team&#x27;s souvenir store, the &quot;Biscuit Basket&quot;). Several successful minor league teams have campy, quirky names to relate to families and kids. During games, biscuits are shot from an air cannon, into the stands. The official team colors are Butter and Blue.

On September 15, 2006, in just their third year of existence, the Biscuits defeated the Huntsville Stars to win the team&#x27;s first Southern League championship in Montgomery. One year later, in 2007, the Biscuits again defeated the Huntsville Stars to win their second consecutive Southern League championship. They became the first team since the 1975 to 1977 Montgomery Rebels to win back-to-back championships.

The Biscuits were sold to a group of investors led by Richmond Flying Squirrels owner Lou DiBella in a transaction that closed on April 27, 2017.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Biscuits were organized into the Double-A South. Though finishing the 2021 season in second place in the Southern Division at 62–55, the two teams with the highest winning percentages in the regular season competed in a best-of-five series to determine the league champion. With the circuit&#x27;s second-best record, the Biscuits faced the Mississippi Braves in the best-of-five series but lost the championship, 3–2. Jonathan Aranda won the league Most Valuable Player Award. In 2022, the Double-A South became known as the Southern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Mascot==
Their mascots are &quot;Big Mo&quot;, an orange beast that loves biscuits, and &quot;Monty&quot;, an anthropomorphized buttermilk biscuit. Monty appears in the logo and on the hat. The mascot for the Orlando Rays was &quot;Spike&quot;, a bear. The origin of Spike is unknown but presumed to predate the Devil Rays, as the club has been controlled by the Cubs and by the Twins (who have a bear mascot, T.C. Bear).

In 2014, a new live mascot was introduced and also named with a contest in which 4,800 entries submitted ideas for a micro-mini pot belly pig which became Miss Gravy, Duchess of Pork. Miss Gravy &quot;retired to a farm in Wetumpka&quot; in 2016.

<text>The University of Königsberg () was the university of Königsberg in Duchy of Prussia, which was a fief of Poland. It was founded in 1544 as the world&#x27;s second Protestant academy (after the University of Marburg) by Duke Albert of Prussia and charted by the King Sigismund II Augustus. It was commonly known as the Albertina and served as a Protestant counterpart to the Catholic Jagiellonian University in Kraków.

Following World War II, the city of Königsberg was transferred to the Soviet Union according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, and renamed Kaliningrad in 1946. The Albertina was closed and the remaining German population expelled, by the terms of the Potsdam Agreement. Today, the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University in Kaliningrad claims to maintain the traditions of the Albertina.

==History==

Albert, former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and first Duke of Prussia since 1525, had purchased a piece of land behind Königsberg Cathedral on the Kneiphof island of the Pregel River from the Samland chapter, where he had an academic gymnasium (school) erected in 1542. He issued the deed of foundation of the &quot;Collegium Albertinum&quot; on 20 July 1544, after which the university was inaugurated on 17 August.

The newly established Protestant duchy was a fiefdom of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the university served as a Lutheran counterpart to the Catholic Kraków Academy. Its first rector was the poet Georg Sabinus, son-in-law of Philipp Melanchthon. Lithuanian scholars Stanislovas Rapalionis and Abraomas Kulvietis were among the first professors of university. All professors had to take an oath on the Augsburg Confession. Since the Prussian lands lay beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire, both Emperor Charles V and Pope Paul III withheld their approval, nevertheless the Königsberg academy received the royal privilege by King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland on 28 March 1560.

From 1618 the Prussian duchy was ruled in personal union by the Margraves of Brandenburg and in 1657 the &quot;Great Elector&quot; Frederick William of Brandenburg finally acquired full sovereignty over Prussia from Poland by the Treaty of Wehlau. The &quot;Albertina&quot; was the second oldest university (after the University of Frankfurt (Oder)) and intellectual centre of Protestant Brandenburg-Prussia. Initially it comprised four colleges: Theology, Medicine, Philosophy and Law, later also natural sciences. Subsequent rectors included numerous Hohenzollern Prussian royals (at last Crown Prince William 1908–1918), who had never been to the university, usually represented by a prorector in charge of academic affairs.

The Prussian lands remained unharmed by the disastrous Thirty Years&#x27; War, which gained the Königsberg university an increasing popularity among students. In the 17th century, it was known as a home to Simon Dach, serving as rector in 1656/57, and his fellow poets. Tsar Peter I of Russia visited the &quot;Albertina&quot; in 1697, leading to increased contacts between Prussia and the Russian Empire. Large numbers of Petrine officials trooped the university to cameralist theory and administrative practices which thus shaped Russia&#x27;s government. Notable Russian students at Königbserg were Kirill Razumovsky, later president of the Russian Academy of Sciences and General Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich. The university and the city had profound impact on the development of Lithuanian culture. The first book in Lithuanian language was printed here in 1547 and several important Lithuanian writers attended the &quot;Albertina&quot;. The university was also the preferred educational institution of the Baltic German nobility.

The 18th century is known in cultural history as the &quot;Königsberg Century&quot; of Enlightenment, a heyday initiated by the &quot;Albertina&quot; student Johann Christoph Gottsched and continued by the philosopher Johann Georg Hamann and writer Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder. Notable alumni were Johann Gottfried Herder, Zacharias Werner, Johann Friedrich Reichardt, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and foremost the philosopher Immanuel Kant, rector in 1786 and 1788. These scholars laid the foundations for the later Weimar Classicism and German Romanticism movements.

The &quot;Albertina&quot; magnificent botanical garden was inaugurated in 1811 during the Napoleonic Wars. Two years later, Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel established his outstanding observatory next door to the garden. Other university professors included such giants of the science world as the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1806–07), the biologist Karl Ernst von Baer (1817–34), the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacobi (1829–42), the mineralogist Franz Ernst Neumann (1828–76) and the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz (1849–55).

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the university was most famous for its school of mathematics, founded by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, and continued by his pupils Ludwig Otto Hesse, Friedrich Richelot, Johann G. Rosenhain and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel. It was later associated with the names of Hermann Minkowski (Albert Einstein&#x27;s teacher), Adolf Hurwitz, Ferdinand von Lindemann and David Hilbert, who was one of the greatest modern mathematicians. The mathematicians Alfred Clebsch and Carl Gottfried Neumann (both born in Königsberg and educated under Ludwig Otto Hesse) founded the &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot; in 1868, which soon became the most influential mathematical journal of the time.

Celebrating the university&#x27;s 300 years jubilee on 31 August 1844, King Frederick William IV of Prussia laid the foundation for the new main building of the &quot;Albertina&quot;, which was inaugurated in 1862 by Crown Prince Frederick William and Prorector Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz. The building on central Paradeplatz was erected in a neo-Renaissance style according to plans designed by Friedrich August Stüler. The facade was adorned by an equestrian figure in relief of Albert of Prussia. Below it were niches containing statues of the Protestant reformers Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon. Inside was a handsome staircase, borne by marble columns. The Senate Hall contained a portrait of Emperor Frederick III by Lauchert and a bust of Immanuel Kant by Hagemann, a student of Schadow. The adjacent hall (&quot;Aula&quot;) was adorned with frescoes painted in 1870.
The university library was situated on Mitteltragheim in 1901 and contained over 230,000 volumes. On Dritte Fliess Strasse was the Palästra Albertina, established in 1898 for the encouragement of the higher forms of sport among the students and citizens. Nearby were the government offices, adorned with mural paintings by Knorr and Schmidt. In 1900, the university had 900 students.

The &quot;Albertina&quot; faculty and the German Student Union after the territorial separation of the Province of East Prussia by the Treaty of Versailles stressed its affiliation with the Reich, pushing intellectual life towards German nationalism. On 10 July 1944, the university celebrated its 400th anniversary in presence of Reich Minister Walther Funk. A few weeks later, during the nights of 26/27 and 29/30 August, Königsberg was extensively bombed by the Royal Air Force. From January to April 1945 the city was further devastated by the East Prussian Offensive of the Red Army and the final Battle of Königsberg. When General Otto Lasch signed the capitulation on 9 April, the historic inner city was destroyed by the attacks, and 80% of the university campus lay in ruins. The faculty had fled, many of them were received at the University of Göttingen.

In 1947, the university, already under new leadership, resumed work, but now as the Kaliningrad State Pedagogical Institute (KSPI).
Which in 1967 received the status of a Kaliningrad State University.

Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University remembers its continuity from the University of Koenigsberg (&quot;Albertina&quot;), preserving the best traditions of the university.

<text>The Party Chancellery (), was the name of the head office for the German Nazi Party (NSDAP), designated as such on 12 May 1941. The office existed previously as the Staff of the Deputy Führer (&quot;Stab des Stellvertreters des Führers&quot;) but was renamed after Rudolf Hess flew to Scotland in an attempt to negotiate a peace agreement without Adolf Hitler&#x27;s authorization. Hess was denounced by Hitler, his former office was dissolved, and the new Party Chancellery was formed in its place under Hess&#x27; former deputy, Martin Bormann.

==History==

Starting in 1933, the party office had its seat in Munich under the leadership of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who held the rank of a Reich Minister in the Hitler Cabinet. Hess&#x27;s department was responsible for handling party affairs; the settling of disputes within the party and acting as an intermediary between the party and the state regarding policy decisions and legislation. The organisation rivaled for influence not only with the Reich Chancellery under Hans Lammers but also with the Führer&#x27;s Chancellery and the Nazi &quot;Gau-&quot; and &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;. Typical of the Nazi regime in many regards, the Party Chancellery competed for spheres of interest with the other two chancelleries, creating several areas of functional duplication, additionally complicating &quot;the relationship between party and state.&quot; 

Another problem that Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery faced was the administrative confusion that arose from all the competing interests of the various subordinated constituent Party organizations like the SA, the SS, the Hitler Youth and the Labor Front among others. There was a seeming lack of a centralized administrative authority for the Nazi Party, so &quot;Gauleiters&quot; bypassed the office of Hess as they believed themselves only responsible to Hitler alone. Even though Hess was Deputy Führer, his office was unable to manage the administrative tasks until Martin Bormann was appointed Chief of Staff to Hess&#x27;s office in July 1933. 

Bormann, personal secretary and chief of staff to Hess, was the man behind the scenes managing the day-to-day business of the Staff of the Deputy Führer. Bormann used his position to create an extensive bureaucracy and involved himself in as much of the decision making as possible. Bormann soon became an efficient and indispensable representative of the party&#x27;s interests, dis-empowering the regional leaders at the intermediate level and extending the Staff of the Deputy Führer&#x27;s involvement in state affairs through the enactment of laws and Führer&#x27;s decrees. In 1935 Bormann began managing Hitler&#x27;s &quot;rural headquarters&quot; at the Obersalzberg in Bavaria. Also in 1935, he was given charge over Hitler&#x27;s personal finances and used his proximity to increase the office&#x27;s authority over the Party&#x27;s numerous organizations; despite this development, incessant jurisdictional struggles still characterized the Nazi state. Bormann set up the Adolf Hitler Fund of German Trade and Industry, which collected money from German industrialists on Hitler&#x27;s behalf. Some of the funds received through this programme were disbursed to various party leaders, but Bormann retained most of it for Hitler&#x27;s personal use. By 1936, Bormann was passing orders directly from Hitler to Reich ministers and Party officials. 

After Hess&#x27; flight to the United Kingdom to seek peace negotiations with the British government on 10 May 1941, Hitler abolished the post of Deputy Führer on 12 May 1941. Hitler assigned Hess&#x27;s former duties to Bormann, with the title of Head of the &quot;Parteikanzlei&quot; (Party Chancellery). In this position he was responsible for all NSDAP appointments, and was answerable only to Hitler. The Party Chancellery was also privy to the extreme violence being carried out in the eastern theater by the SS Task Forces in the summer and fall of 1941, as Gestapo chief, Heinrich Müller, distributed reports, which were signed by senior officials from throughout the Reich. Legal and administrative questions governing jurisdictional matters related to the Wannsee Conference were shared by Reinhard Heydrich with Party organizations, including Bormann&#x27;s Party Chancellery in late January 1942, rendering them all complicit for the 
orchestration of the Final Solution. 

Bormann used his position to restrict access to Hitler for his own benefit and, supported by deputies like Albert Hoffmann, Gerhard Klopfer and Helmuth Friedrichs, to further party influence in areas such as armaments and manpower. Armaments Minister Albert Speer complained about Bormann&#x27;s interfering with his staff in this manner. On 12 April 1943, Bormann was officially appointed the Führer&#x27;s Private Secretary, reaching a unique position of power and trust with Hitler. Sometime in the autumn of 1943, Goebbels expressed misgivings with Hitler&#x27;s dependence on Bormann concerning domestic affairs, his focus on military matters and his seeming neglect of politics—Goebbels recorded this moment as &quot;a leadership crisis&quot; in his diary. Goebbels further believed that &quot;the Party Chancellery chief was managing Hitler.&quot; By that time, Bormann had de facto control over all domestic matters. He held the position of leader of the Nazi Party Chancellery until 30 April 1945. Late in waning months of the war, Bormann was still &quot;working feverishly&quot; to restructure the Nazi Party for a post-war Germany. Sharing in Hitler&#x27;s delusions, Bormann was exercising his power over the Party by issuing decrees and directives on a wide variety of issues at the very end, meanwhile Hitler was moving &quot;non-existent armies&quot; around on a map deep inside the bunker.

<text>Rud Hud Hudibras (&quot;Welsh:&quot; Run baladr bras) was a legendary king of the Britons as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He came to power in 974BC.

He was the son of King Leil and ruled during a civil war.

== Story ==
During the waning years of Leil&#x27;s reign, the kingdom of the Britons became unstable, and civil war broke out. Rud Hud Hudibras became king after his father&#x27;s death and reigned for 39 years, ending the civil war and restoring peace to the kingdom. During his reign, he founded Kaerreint, later renamed Canterbury by the Angles. He is also said to have founded Kaerguenit (Winchester) and Paladur Castle (Shaftesbury). He was succeeded by his son Bladud.

Geoffrey places Rud Hud Hudibras&#x27; reign during the time Capys was king in Alba Longa and Haggai, Amos, Joel, and Azariah were prophesying in Israel. Haggai began his ministry around 520 BC, whilst Amos is said to have prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah of Judah and Jeroboam II, probably around 760 BC.

== In literature and fiction ==
A reference to Rud Hud Hudibras is featured in the title and character of Samuel Butler&#x27;s mock-heroic poem &quot;Hudibras&quot; (1663–1678).

Rud Hud Hudibras is a primary character in American author Zachary J. Cooper&#x27;s series of short stories set in Ancient Wales.

<text>Vítor Manuel Martins Baía, (; born 15 October 1969) is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

One of the most decorated goalkeepers of all time, his career was intimately connected with FC Porto, which he started representing still in his teens, helping it to 26 titles and eventually remaining with the club in an ambassadorial role.

Also having played for Barcelona, Baía appeared with the Portugal national team in two European Championships and the 2002 World Cup.

==Club career==
===Porto===
Born in Vila Nova de Gaia, Porto District, Baía joined FC Porto&#x27;s youth ranks at 13 from also northern club Leça FC. In early 1989, he renounced to appear at the FIFA World Youth Championship, as he had relegated Pole Józef Młynarczyk to the bench and his club was still chasing the Primeira Liga title, which eventually eluded them (second place).

Baía made his first-team debut in a game against Vítoria de Guimarães, and did not lose his starting place for the following seven seasons, winning five leagues and two Taça de Portugal and conceding only 116 goals (16,5 goals per year). It was between 1994 and 1996 that he made his name as a world-class goalkeeper, being voted for the &quot;ESM Team of the Year&quot; after the 1994–95 season and being named in the &quot;IFFHS&#x27; World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper of the Year 1995&quot; list, finishing sixth in the voting and improving to fifth in the following year; consequently, he was named in the Portugal squad for Euro 1996, being transferred after this tournament to Spain&#x27;s FC Barcelona for the highest amount paid for a player in the position in the world.

===Barcelona===
While he only missed one La Liga match in his first season, as Barcelona finished second to Real Madrid, adding that campaign&#x27;s UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Baía also suffered from knee problems during his two-and-a-half-year spell.

Additionally, when Louis van Gaal took over at Barcelona from Bobby Robson, he was dropped from the team in favour of the manager&#x27;s compatriot Ruud Hesp, being subsequently loaned in mid-season back to Porto, filling the position some said he had &quot;haunted&quot; since his departure.

===Porto return===

In January 1999, Baía returned to Porto to find the No. 1 jersey unavailable, so he chose No. 99 instead, with the sales of that number being a success as well as the club&#x27;s game attendances, highly related to the player&#x27;s return. When his career seemed back on track, he was injured again during the 1999–2000 season, needing a corrective surgery on his knee.

Baía returned to Barcelona in the summer of 2000, being immediately released and signing with Porto. After one year on the sidelines due to injury, he made his comeback in the 2001–02 campaign in a reserves match against S.C. Vila Real, on 26 November 2001. Sixteen days later, he made his competitive debut against C.D. Santa Clara in the cup; after a full recovery, he was included in the list for the 2002 World Cup.

Baía was in great shape again in 2002–03, helping his team to win the league title, the cup and the UEFA Cup, appearing in 11 of 13 matches in the latter competition, including the semi-finals against S.S. Lazio where he saved a penalty kick, and the final against Celtic. It would not be until the following campaign when he regained full fitness again, and he would have one of the most impressive years of his career, winning the UEFA Champions League and his seventh league trophy – in the former competition, he played all games and minutes as Porto beat AS Monaco FC in the final (3–0) and, consequently, he was selected as the &quot;UEFA Club Best Goalkeeper of the Year&quot;, being the first Portuguese goalkeeper to win this individual title. This was not, however, good enough for Euro 2004 selection, with Sporting CP&#x27;s Ricardo being controversially preferred. Later, in 2007, in a FIFA.com interview, Baía said: &quot;(...) It&#x27;s kind of strange because I was voted as being the best goalkeeper in Europe in the 2003/04 season and a few days before the squad for UEFA EURO 2004 was announced I&#x27;d won the Portuguese championship and the UEFA Champions League and even then I wasn&#x27;t called up&quot;; at the end of the season he was named in the list for &quot;IFFHS&#x27; World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper of the Year 2004&quot;, finishing eighth in the voting while Ricardo ranked 19th.

At the start of 2005–06, under Dutch coach Co Adriaanse, Baía initially started the season but lost his status midway through it, being replaced by Brazilian Helton. Although he was a part of the squad that won Porto&#x27;s second league in a row the following campaign the player, in the last year of his contract, made only one league start, on the final league matchday, a 4–1 home win against C.D. Aves which would be his 700th official appearance; upon retiring at nearly 38, on 14 June 2007, he became director of public relations with his main club, leaving the post in late July 2010. He and Italian Stefano Tacconi are the only goalkeepers in history to have won the three main UEFA club competitions.

==International career==
Baía made his Portugal senior debut on 19 December 1990 in a 1–0 friendly win over the United States, at the age of 21. He went on to make 80 appearances for the national team until 2002, playing all the games at UEFA Euro 1996 and 2000 (except one in the latter, as they were already qualified) and in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In Euro 2000, he stopped Arif Erdem&#x27;s penalty in the 2–0 defeat of Turkey in the quarter-finals.

After the failure in the 2002 World Cup, coach António Oliveira was sacked when he refused to quit. Luiz Felipe Scolari was hired as his replacement and Baía, a stalwart for the past ten years with a record of caps in his position, was ditched.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Baía founded a charity with his wife Alexandra Rodrigues de Almeida, which would bear his own name and would be dedicated to helping underprivileged children and troubled teens. Also that year, he would donate a pair of his autographed gloves to be included in the UEFA Jubilee time capsule, a collection of UEFA memorabilia that was sealed underground in September, only opened 50 years hence.

Baía published his autobiography entitled &quot;99 – Vítor Baía&quot; in 2005. On 10 June 2008, he was made an Officer of the &quot;Ordem do Infante Dom Henrique&quot; by the president of Portugal, Aníbal Cavaco Silva.

In August 2015, EA Sports announced Baía as part of their &quot;FIFA 16&quot; Ultimate Team Legends, along with eight other former footballers.

<text>George Rogers Clark (November 19, 1752 – February 13, 1818) was an American military officer and surveyor from Virginia who became the highest-ranking Patriot military officer on the northwestern frontier during the Revolutionary War. He served as leader of the Virginia militia in Kentucky (then part of Virginia) throughout much of the war. He is best known for his captures of Kaskaskia in 1778 and Vincennes in 1779 during the Illinois campaign, which greatly weakened British influence in the Northwest Territory (then part of the British Province of Quebec) and earned Clark the nickname of &quot;Conqueror of the Old Northwest.&quot; The British ceded the entire Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. 

Clark&#x27;s major military achievements occurred before his thirtieth birthday. Afterward, he led militia forces in the opening engagements of the Northwest Indian War, but was accused of being drunk on duty. He was disgraced and forced to resign, despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations. Clark left Kentucky to live in the Indiana Territory but was never fully reimbursed by the Virginian government for his wartime expenditures. During the final decades of his life, he worked to evade creditors and suffered living in increasing poverty and obscurity. He was involved in two failed attempts to open the Spanish-controlled Mississippi River to American traffic. Following a stroke and the amputation of his right leg, he became disabled. Clark was aided in his final years by family members, including his younger brother William, one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He died of a stroke on February 13, 1818.

==Early life==
George Rogers Clark was born on November 19, 1752, in Albemarle County, Virginia, near Charlottesville, the hometown of Thomas Jefferson. He was the second of ten children borne by John and Ann Rogers Clark, who were Anglicans of English and possibly Scottish descent. Five of their six sons became officers during the American Revolutionary War. Their youngest son William was too young to fight in the war, but he later became famous as a leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The family moved from the frontier to Caroline County, Virginia, in 1756 after the outbreak of the French and Indian War. They lived on a plantation that they later developed to a total of more than .

Clark had little formal education. He lived with his grandfather so that he could receive a common education at Donald Robertson&#x27;s school, where fellow students included James Madison and John Taylor of Caroline. He was also tutored at home, as was usual for the children of Virginia planters in this period. There was no public education. His grandfather trained him to be a surveyor.

In 1771, at age 19, Clark left his home on his first surveying trip into western Virginia. In 1772, he made his first foray into Kentucky via the Ohio River at Pittsburgh and spent the next two years surveying the Kanawha River region, as well as learning about the area&#x27;s natural history and customs of the various tribes of Indians who lived there. In the meantime, thousands of settlers were entering the area as a result of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, by which some of the tribes had agreed to peace.

Clark&#x27;s military career began in 1774, when he served as a captain in the Virginia militia. He was preparing to lead an expedition of 90 men down the Ohio River when hostilities broke out between the Shawnee and settlers on the Kanawha frontier; this conflict eventually culminated in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War. Most of Kentucky was not inhabited by Indians, although such tribes as the Shawnee, Cherokee, and Seneca (of the Iroquois Confederacy) used the area for hunting. Tribes in the Ohio country who had not been party to the treaty signed with the Cherokee were angry, because the Kentucky hunting grounds had been ceded without their approval. As a result, they tried to resist encroachment by the American settlers, but were unsuccessful. Clark spent a few months surveying in Kentucky, as well as assisting in organizing Kentucky as a county for Virginia prior to the American Revolutionary War.

==Revolutionary War==
As the American Revolutionary War began in the East, Kentucky&#x27;s settlers became involved in a dispute about the region&#x27;s sovereignty. Richard Henderson, a judge and land speculator from North Carolina, had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee by an illegal treaty. Henderson intended to create a proprietary colony known as Transylvania, but many Kentucky settlers did not recognize Transylvania&#x27;s authority over them. In June of 1776, these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly, asking Virginia to formally extend its boundaries to include Kentucky.

Clark and Jones traveled the Wilderness Road to Williamsburg, where they convinced Governor Patrick Henry to create Kentucky County, Virginia. Clark was given of gunpowder to help defend the settlements and was appointed a major in the Kentucky County militia. Although he was only 24 years old, he led older but lesser ranked settlers such as Daniel Boone, James Harrod and Benjamin Logan.

===Illinois campaign===

In 1777, the Revolutionary War intensified in Kentucky. Lieutenant-governor Henry Hamilton, based at Fort Detroit, provided weapons to his Indian allies, supporting their raids on settlers in hope of reclaiming their lands. The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion in the northwest or for the defense of Kentucky, which was left entirely to the local population. Clark spent several months defending settlements against the Indian raiders as a leader in the Kentucky County militia, while developing his plan for a long-distance strike against the British. His strategy involved seizing British outposts north of the Ohio River to destroy British influence among their Indian allies.

In December of 1777, Clark presented his plan to Virginia&#x27;s Governor Patrick Henry, and he asked for permission to lead a secret expedition to capture the British-held villages at Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in the Illinois country. Governor Henry commissioned him as a lieutenant colonel in the Illinois Regiment of the Virginia State Forces and authorized him to raise troops for the expedition. The unit originally was raised as a special Virginia militia regiment for defense of the Western Department. Clark and his officers recruited volunteers from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. Clark arrived at Redstone, a settlement on the Monongahela River south of Fort Pitt on February 1, where he made preparations for the expedition over the next several months. The men gathered at Redstone and the regiment departed from there on May 12, proceeding on boats down the Monongahela to Fort Pitt to take on supplies and then down the Ohio to Fort Henry and on to Fort Randolph at the mouth of the Kanawha. They reached the Falls of the Ohio in early June where they spent about a month along the Ohio River preparing for their secret mission.

In July of 1778, Clark led about 175 men of the Illinois Regiment and crossed the Ohio River at Fort Massac and marched to Kaskaskia, capturing it on the night of July 4 without firing their weapons. The next day, Captain Joseph Bowman and his company captured Cahokia in a similar fashion without firing a shot. The garrison at Vincennes along the Wabash River surrendered to Clark in August. Several other villages and British forts were subsequently captured, after British hopes of local support failed to materialize. To counter Clark&#x27;s advance, Hamilton recaptured the garrison at Vincennes, which the British called Fort Sackville, with a small force in December of 1778.

Prior to initiating a march on Fort Detroit, Clark used his own resources and borrowed from his friends to continue his campaign after the initial appropriation had been depleted from the Virginia legislature. He re-enlisted some of his troops and recruited additional men to join him. Hamilton waited for spring to begin a campaign to retake the forts at Kaskaskia and Cahokia, but Clark planned another surprise attack on Fort Sackville at Vincennes. He left Kaskaskia on February 6, 1779, with about 170 men, beginning an arduous overland trek, encountering melting snow, ice, and cold rain along the journey. They arrived at Vincennes on February 23 and besieged Fort Sackville. After a siege which included the killing of 5 captive Indians on Clark&#x27;s orders to intimidate the British, Hamilton surrendered the garrison on February 25 and was captured in the process. The winter expedition was Clark&#x27;s most significant military achievement and became the basis of his reputation as an early American military hero.

News of Clark&#x27;s victory reached General George Washington, and his success was celebrated and was used to encourage the alliance with France. General Washington recognized that Clark&#x27;s achievement had been gained without support from the regular army, either in men or funds. Virginia also capitalized on Clark&#x27;s success, laying claim to the Old Northwest by calling it Illinois County, Virginia.

===Final years of the war===
Clark&#x27;s ultimate goal during the Revolutionary War was to seize the British-held fort at Detroit, but he could never recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make the attempt. Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their own territory and stay closer to home, rather than make the long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. Clark returned to the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to defend the Ohio River valley until the end of the war.

In June of 1780, a mixed British-Indian force, including Shawnee, Lenape and Wyandot warriors, set out from Fort Detroit and invaded Kentucky. They captured two fortified settlements and seized hundreds of prisoners. In August of 1780, Clark led a retaliatory force that defeated the Shawnee at the village of Peckuwe. It has been commemorated as George Rogers Clark Park near Springfield, Ohio.

In 1781, Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson promoted Clark to brigadier general and gave him command of all the militia in the Kentucky and Illinois counties. As Clark prepared to lead another expedition against the British and their allies in Detroit, General Washington transferred a small group of regulars to assist, but the detachment was disastrously defeated in August of 1781 before they could meet up with Clark. This ended the western campaign.

In August of 1782, another British-Indian force defeated the Kentucky militia at the Battle of Blue Licks. Clark was the militia&#x27;s senior military officer, but he had not been present at the battle and was severely criticized in the Virginia Council for the disaster. In response, during November of 1782, Clark led another expedition into the Ohio country, destroying several Indian villages along the Great Miami River, including the Shawnee village of Piqua, Miami County, Ohio. This was the last major expedition of the war.

The importance of Clark&#x27;s activities during the Revolutionary War has been the subject of much debate among historians. As early as 1779, George Mason called Clark the &quot;Conqueror of the Northwest.&quot; Because the British ceded the entire Old Northwest Territory to the United States in the Treaty of Paris, some historians, including William Hayden English, credit Clark with nearly doubling the size of the original Thirteen Colonies when he seized control of the Illinois country during the war. Clark&#x27;s Illinois campaign—particularly the surprise march to Vincennes—was greatly celebrated and romanticized.

More recent scholarship from historians such as Lowell Harrison has downplayed the importance of the campaign in the peace negotiations and the outcome of the war, arguing that Clark&#x27;s &quot;conquest&quot; was little more than a temporary occupation of territory. Although the Illinois campaign is frequently described in terms of a harsh, winter ordeal for the Americans, James Fischer points out that the capture of Kaskaskia and Vincennes may not have been as difficult as previously suggested. Kaskaskia proved to be an easy target; Clark had sent two spies there in June of 1777, who reported &quot;an absence of soldiers in the town.&quot;

Clark&#x27;s men also easily captured Vincennes and Fort Sackville. Prior to their arrival in 1778, Clark had sent Captain Leonard Helm to Vincennes to gather intelligence. In addition, Father Pierre Gibault, a local priest, helped persuade the town&#x27;s inhabitants to side with the Americans. Before Clark and his men set out to recapture Vincennes in 1779, Francis Vigo provided Clark with additional information on the town, its surrounding area, and the fort. Clark was already aware of the fort&#x27;s military strength, poor location (surrounded by houses that could provide cover to attackers), and dilapidated condition. Clark&#x27;s strategy of a surprise attack and strong intelligence were critical in catching Hamilton and his men unaware and vulnerable. After killing five captive Indians by hatchet within view of the fort, Clark forced its surrender.

==Later years==

In 1783, Clark, who &quot;had a reputation as an Indian hater&quot; and once declared that he would like to see &quot;the whole race of Indians extirpated, that for his part he would never spare Man woman or child of them on whom he could lay his hands&quot;, publicly proposed that a 2,000-strong force be mustered in Virginia to attack Native Americans in the Ohio Valley. Clark argued that this proposed expedition would show &quot;that [the United States] are always able to crush [Native Americans] at our pleasure&quot;. He also once told Native Americans that if they declared war on the United States, they &quot;should know that the next thing would be the Tomahawk&quot; with &quot;Your Women &amp; Children given to the Dogs to eat&quot;. The proposed expedition was never carried out due to budgetary concerns.

After Clark&#x27;s victories in the Illinois country, settlers continued to pour into Kentucky and spread into and develop the land north of the Ohio River. On December 17, 1783, was Clark appointed Principal Surveyor of Bounty Lands. From 1784 to 1788, Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia&#x27;s war veterans, surveying lands granted to them for their service in the war. The position brought Clark a small income, but he devoted very little time to the enterprise.

Clark helped to negotiate the Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785 and the Treaty of Fort Finney in 1786, but the violence between Native Americans and European-American settlers continued to escalate. According to a 1790 U.S. government report, 1,500 Kentucky settlers had been killed in Indian raids since the end of the Revolutionary War. In an attempt to end the raids, Clark led an expedition of 1,200 drafted men against Native American villages along the Wabash River in 1786. The campaign, one of the first actions of the Northwest Indian War, ended without a victory. After approximately three hundred militiamen mutinied due to a lack of supplies, Clark had to withdraw, but not before concluding a ceasefire with the native tribes. It was rumored, most notably by James Wilkinson, that Clark had often been drunk on duty. When Clark learned of the accusations, he demanded an official inquiry, but the Virginia governor declined his request and Virginia Council condemned Clark&#x27;s actions. With Clark&#x27;s reputation tarnished, he never again led men in battle. Clark left Kentucky and moved across the Ohio River to the Indiana frontier, near present-day Clarksville, Indiana.

===Life in Indiana===
Following his military service, and especially after 1787, Clark spent much of the remainder of his life dealing with financial difficulties. Clark had financed the majority of his military campaigns with borrowed funds. When creditors began pressuring him to repay his debts, Clark was unable to obtain reimbursement from Virginia or the United States Congress. Due to haphazard record keeping on the frontier during the war, Virginia refused payment, claiming that Clark&#x27;s receipts for his purchases were &quot;fraudulent&quot;.

As compensation for his wartime service, Virginia gave Clark a gift of of land that became known as Clark&#x27;s Grant in present-day southern Indiana, while the soldiers who fought with Clark also received smaller tracts of land. The grant and his other holdings gave Clark ownership of land that encompassed present-day Clark County, Indiana, and portions of adjoining Floyd and Scott Counties. Although Clark had claims to tens of thousands of acres of land, the result of his military service and land speculation, he was &quot;land-poor,&quot; meaning that he owned much land but lacked the resources to develop it. Clark&#x27;s receipts were discovered in the Richmond Virginia&#x27;s Auditors building in the early twentieth century showing that his record keeping efforts were complete and correct but not reimbursed due to the State of Virginia&#x27;s incompetency, thus he was exonerated, though not officially. Although the autobiography contains factual inaccuracies, the work includes Clark&#x27;s perspective on the events of his life. Some historians believe Clark wrote his memoirs in attempt to salvage his damaged reputation and to document his contributions during the Revolutionary War.

===In the service of the French===

On February 2, 1793, with his career seemingly over and his prospects for prosperity doubtful, Clark offered his services to Edmond-Charles Genêt, the controversial ambassador of revolutionary France, hoping to earn money to maintain his estate. Many Americans were outraged that the Spanish, who controlled Louisiana, denied Americans free access to the Mississippi River, their only easy outlet for long-distance commerce. The Washington administration was also unresponsive to western matters.

Genêt appointed Clark &quot;Major General in the Armies of France and Commander-in-chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the Mississippi River&quot;. Clark began to organize a campaign to seize New Madrid, St. Louis, Natchez, and New Orleans, getting assistance from old comrades such as Benjamin Logan and John Montgomery, and winning the tacit support of Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby. Clark spent $4,680 () of his own money for supplies.

In early 1794, however, President Washington issued a proclamation forbidding Americans from violating U.S. neutrality and threatened to dispatch General Anthony Wayne to Fort Massac to stop the expedition. The French government recalled Genêt and revoked the commissions he granted to the Americans for the war against Spain. Clark&#x27;s planned campaign gradually collapsed, and he was unable to convince the French to reimburse him for his expenses. Clark&#x27;s reputation, already damaged by earlier accusations at the end of the Revolutionary War, was further maligned as a result of his involvement in these foreign intrigues. Brigadier General James Wilkinson, 2nd in command of the Legion of the United States, claimed credit for undermining Clark and for preventing supplies from being shipped down the Ohio River.

===Mounting debts===

In his later years Clark&#x27;s mounting debts made it impossible for him to retain ownership of his land, since it became subject to seizure due to his debts. Clark deeded much of his land to friends or transferred ownership to family members so his creditors could not seize it. Lenders and their assignees eventually deprived the veteran of nearly all of the property that remained in his name. Clark, who was at one time the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville. In 1803 Clark built a cabin overlooking the Falls of the Ohio, where he lived until his health failed in 1809. He also purchased a small gristmill, which Clark operated with two slaves he owned.

Clark&#x27;s knowledge of the region helped him to become an expert on the West&#x27;s natural history. Over the years he welcomed travelers, including those interested in natural history, to his home overlooking the Ohio River. Clark supplied details on the area&#x27;s plant and animal life to John Pope and John James Audubon, and hosted his brother, William, and Meriweather Lewis, prior to their expedition to the Pacific Northwest. Clark also provided information on the Ohio Valley&#x27;s native tribes to Allan Bowie Magruder and archaeological evidence related to the Mound Builders to John P. Campbell.

In later life Clark continued to struggle with alcohol abuse, a problem which had plagued him on-and-off for many years. He also remained bitter about his treatment and neglect by Virginia, and blamed it for his financial misfortune.

When the Indiana Territory chartered the Indiana Canal Company in 1805 to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio, near Clarksville, Clark was named to the board of directors. He became part of the surveying team that assisted in laying out the route of the canal. The company collapsed the next year before construction could begin, when two of the fellow board members, including Vice President Aaron Burr, were arrested for treason. A large part of the company&#x27;s $1.2 million (equivalent to $ million USD in ) in investments was unaccounted for; its location was never determined.

===Return to Kentucky===
Alcoholism and poor health affected Clark during his final years. In 1809, he suffered a severe stroke. When he fell into a burning fireplace, he suffered a burn on his right leg that was so severe it had to be amputated. The injury made it impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13 km) from the growing town of Louisville, and became a member of the household of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.

In 1812, the Virginia General Assembly granted Clark a pension of four hundred dollars per year (an equivalent of $9,488 USD in 2024) and finally recognized his services in the Revolutionary War by presenting him with a ceremonial sword.

==Death and legacy==

After another stroke, Clark died at Locust Grove on February 13, 1818; he was buried at Locust Grove Cemetery two days later. Clark&#x27;s remains were exhumed along with those of his other family members on October 29, 1869, and buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

In his funeral oration, Judge John Rowan succinctly summed up Clark&#x27;s stature and importance during the critical years on the trans-Appalachian frontier: &quot;The mighty oak of the forest has fallen, and now the scrub oaks sprout all around.&quot; Clark&#x27;s career was closely tied to events in the Ohio-Mississippi Valley at a pivotal time when the region was inhabited by numerous Native American tribes and claimed by the British, Spanish, and French, as well as the fledgling U.S. government. As a member of the Virginia militia, and with Virginia&#x27;s support, Clark&#x27;s campaign into the Illinois country helped strengthen Virginia&#x27;s claim on lands in the region as it came under the control of the Americans. Clark&#x27;s military service in the interior of North America also helped him became an &quot;important source of leadership and information (although not necessarily accurate) on the West.&quot;

Clark is best known as a war hero of the Revolutionary War in the West, especially as the leader of the secret expeditionary forces that captured Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in 1778–79. Some historians have suggested that the campaign supported American claims to the Northwest Territory during negotiations that resulted in the Treaty of Paris (1783). Clark&#x27;s Grant, the large tract of land on the north side of the Ohio River that he received as compensation for his military service, included a large portion of Clark County, Indiana, and portions of Floyd and Scott Counties, as well as the present-day site of Clarksville, Indiana, the first American town laid out in the Northwest Territory (in 1784). Clark served as the first chairman of the Clarksville, Indiana, board of trustees. Clark was unable to retain title to his landholdings. At the end of his life, he was poor, in ill health, and frequently intoxicated.

Several years after Clark&#x27;s death the government of Virginia granted his estate $30,000 () as a partial payment on the debts it owed him. The Virginian government continued to repay Clark for decades; the last payment to his estate was made in 1913. Clark never married and he kept no account of any romantic relationships, although his family held that he had once been in love with Teresa de Leyba, sister of Fernando de Leyba, the lieutenant governor of Spanish Louisiana. Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts in the archives of the Wisconsin Historical Society attest to their belief in Clark&#x27;s lifelong disappointment over the failed romance.

==Honors and tributes==
* On May 23, 1928, President Calvin Coolidge ordered a memorial to Clark to be erected at Vincennes, Indiana. Completed in 1933, the George Rogers Clark Memorial was dedicated on June 14, 1936, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

<text>The St. Francis River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, about long, in southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas in the United States. The river drains a mostly rural area and forms part of the Missouri-Arkansas state line along the western side of the Missouri Bootheel.

==Description and course==
The river rises in a region of granite mountains in Iron County, Missouri, and flows generally southwardly through the Ozarks and the St. Francois Mountains near Missouri&#x27;s highest point Taum Sauk. It forms the Missouri-Arkansas border in the Bootheel and eventually exits the state at Missouri&#x27;s lowest point in the &quot;toe&quot; at above sea level. It passes through Lake Wappapello, which is formed by a dam constructed in 1941. Below the dam the river meanders through cane forests and willow wetlands or forested swamp, transitioning from a clear stream into a slow and silt-laden muddy river as it enters the flat lands of the Mississippi embayment. In its lower course the river parallels Crowleys Ridge and is part of a navigation and flood-control project that encompasses a network of diversion channels and ditches along it and the Castor and Little rivers. Below the mouth of the Little River in Poinsett County, Arkansas, the St. Francis is navigable by barge. It joins the Mississippi River in Phillips County, Arkansas, about north of Helena.

Along its course in Missouri, the river flows through the Mark Twain National Forest and past Sam A. Baker State Park and the towns of Farmington, Greenville and Fisk. In Arkansas it passes the towns of St. Francis, Lake City, Marked Tree and Parkin, and continues through two additional namesakes of the river — St. Francis County, and St. Francis Township in northeastern Phillips County — ending its course adjoining the St. Francis National Forest.

In addition to the Little River, tributaries of the St. Francis include the Little St. Francis River, which joins it along its upper course in Missouri; the Tyronza River, which joins it in Arkansas; and the L&#x27;Anguille River, which joins it just above its mouth.

==History==
The river became the home of Cherokee Indians who attacked a boat on the Tennessee River on June 11, 1794 known as the Muscle Shoals Massacre and had removed to the west. The Spanish authorities allowed the Indian settlement to trade and the area flourished with a population greater than Arkansas Post.

==Names==
The origin of the river&#x27;s name is unclear. It might refer to St. Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscan order. None of the region&#x27;s early explorers were Franciscans, however. One possibility is that Jacques Marquette, a Jesuit, named the river when he explored its mouth in 1673. Before his voyage down the Mississippi Marquette had spent some time at the mission of St. François Xavier, named for the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier. The spelling of the river&#x27;s name shifted from &quot;François&quot; to &quot;Francis&quot; in the early 20th century. A number of place names in the region stem from the river&#x27;s name, including St. Francois County and the St. Francois Mountains.

The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on &quot;St. Francis River&quot; as the stream&#x27;s name in 1899. According to the Geographic Names Information System, historical names for the river have included:

<doc id="671030" wikidata="Q276510" url="?curid=671030" title="Ernesto Cardenal">
<text>Ernesto Cardenal Martínez (20 January 1925 – 1 March 2020) was a Nicaraguan Catholic priest, poet, and politician. He was a liberation theologian and the founder of the primitivist art community in the Solentiname Islands, where he lived for more than ten years (1965–1977). A former member of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, he was Nicaragua&#x27;s minister of culture from 1979 to 1987. He was prohibited from administering the sacraments in 1984 by Pope John Paul II, but rehabilitated by Pope Francis in 2019.

==Early life==
Cardenal was born into an upper-class family in Granada, Nicaragua. He studied at Colegio Centro América in Nicaragua. One of his brothers was fellow priest Fernando Cardenal. A first cousin of the poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Cardenal studied literature in Managua and then from 1942 to 1946 in Mexico and from 1947 to 1949 in New York City. In 1949 and 1950, he traveled through Italy, Spain and Switzerland.

In July 1950, he returned to Nicaragua, where he participated in the 1954 April Revolution against Anastasio Somoza García&#x27;s regime. The coup d&#x27;état failed and ended with the deaths of many of his associates. After a deep mystical experience that Cardenal had on June,2, 1956, in 1957 he entered the Trappist Monastery of Gethsemani (Kentucky, United States), joining another poet-priest, Thomas Merton, who was the master of novices; but in 1959, he left to study theology in Cuernavaca, Mexico.

==Priesthood==
Cardenal was ordained a Catholic priest in 1965 in Granada. He went to the Solentiname Islands, where he founded a Christian, almost-monastic, mainly-peasant community, which eventually led to the founding of the artists&#x27; colony. The colony engaged with painting as well as sculpture and was visited many times by artists and writers of the region such as Willarson Brandt, Julio Cortázar, Asilia Guillén, and Aedes Margarita. It was there that the famous book &quot;El Evangelio en Solentiname&quot; (&quot;The Gospel in Solentiname&quot;) was written. Cardenal collaborated closely with the leftist Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (Sandinista National Liberation Front, or FSLN) in working to overthrow Anastasio Somoza Debayle&#x27;s regime.

==Nicaraguan Revolution==
Many members of the Solentiname community engaged in the revolutionary process through guerrilla warfare that the FSLN had developed to strike at the regime. The year 1977 was crucial to Cardenal&#x27;s community, when Somoza&#x27;s National Guard, as a result of an attack to the headquarters stationed in the city of San Carlos a few kilometres from the community, raided Solentiname and burned it to the ground. Cardenal fled to Costa Rica.

Cardenal was a believer in Christian communism saying &quot;Christ led me to Marx...for me, the four Gospels are all equally Communist. I’m a Marxist who believes in God, follows Christ and is a revolutionary for his Kingdom&quot;. He later said &quot;The Bible is full of revolutions. The prophets are people with a message of revolution. Jesus of Nazareth takes the revolutionary message of the prophets. And we also will continue trying to change the world and make revolution. Those revolutions failed, but others will come&quot;.
On 19 July 1979, immediately after the Liberation of Managua, he was named Minister of Culture by the new Sandinista government. He campaigned for a &quot;revolution without vengeance.&quot; His brother Fernando Cardenal, also a Catholic priest (in the Jesuit order), was appointed Minister of Education. When Pope John Paul II visited Nicaragua in 1983, he openly scolded Ernesto Cardenal, who knelt before him on the Managua airport runway, for resisting his order to resign from the government, and admonished him: &quot;Usted tiene que arreglar sus asuntos con la Iglesia&quot; (&quot;You must fix your affairs with the Church&quot;). On 4 February 1984 Pope John Paul II suspended Cardenal &quot;a divinis&quot; because of Cardenal&#x27;s refusal to leave his political office. This suspension remained in effect until it was lifted by Pope Francis in 2019. Cardenal remained Minister of Culture until 1987, when his ministry was closed for economic reasons.

==Later career==
Cardenal left the FSLN in 1994, protesting the authoritarian direction of the party under Daniel Ortega, calling it a &quot;robbery of the people and dictatorship not a revolutionary movement&quot; when he left the government. He was a member of the Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista (Sandinista Renovation Movement, or MRS) that participated in the 2006 Nicaraguan general election. Days before the election, Cardenal explained his decision: &quot;I think more desirable an authentic capitalism, as Montealegre&#x27;s [Eduardo Montealegre, the presidential candidate for Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance] would be, than a false Revolution.&quot;

He was also a member of the board of advisers of the Latin American television station teleSUR.

Cardenal was a polemical figure in Nicaragua&#x27;s literary and cultural history. He has been described as &quot;the most important poet right now in Latin America&quot; politically and poetically. He was a vocal representative for Nicaragua and a key to understanding the contemporary literary and cultural life of Nicaragua. He participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007. During a short visit to India, he made a profound impression on a group of writers called the Hungry Generation.

Cardenal&#x27;s tour of the United States in 2011 to promote his newest work stirred up some controversy, as with the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property that protested his appearances at Catholic schools such as Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, because of his Marxist ideology.

On 18 February 2019, Archbishop Waldemar Sommertag, the Vatican nuncio in Nicaragua, announced that Pope Francis had ended Cardenal&#x27;s suspension and that Cardenal was &quot;granted with benevolence the absolution of all canonical censures&quot;. His return to ministry was also confirmed by Managua Auxiliary Bishop Silvio Báez, who stated “I visited my friend priest, Father Ernesto Cardenal, in the hospital, with whom I could talk for a few minutes. After praying for him, I knelt in his bed and asked for his blessing as a priest of the Catholic Church, to which he agreed joyfully. Thank you, Ernesto! ”

On 1 March 2020, Cardenal died due to complications from ongoing heart and kidney problems. His funeral was held in the Managua Cathedral on March 3, 2020, and was disrupted by at least 100 pro-Ortega protestors who shouted &quot;viva Daniel&quot; and &quot;traitor&quot; at his Nicaraguan flag-draped casket. To avoid further harassment, Cardenal&#x27;s burial was held in secret. At his request, Cardenal&#x27;s remains were cremated and then buried in the community he founded on the Solentiname Islands.

== Poetry ==
Earlier works were focused on life and love; however, some works like &quot;Zero Hour&quot; had a direct correlation to his Marxist political ideas, being tied to the assassination of guerrilla leader Augusto César Sandino. Cardenal&#x27;s poetry also was heavily influenced by his unique Catholic ideology, mainly liberation theology. Some of his latest works are heavily influenced by his understanding of science and evolution, though it is still in dialogue with his earlier Marxist and Catholic material. Cardenal sums up his later material in a &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; interview:

<text>The Dubuque Star Brewery, located in Dubuque, Iowa, is a building that for many years made Dubuque Star beers. The brewery is located just north of the Ice Harbor in Dubuque.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

==History==
Dubuque Star was established by Joseph Rhomberg in 1898. Until the beginning of Prohibition, the brewery produced Dubuque Star beer. As with many other breweries, the Dubuque Star brewery was forced to close down. Before Prohibition, there were 138 breweries in the state, but afterwards Dubuque Star was the only small brewery left in the state.

With the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the brewery was reopened. Because of its location near the Mississippi River, when the river flooded it would often cause problems for the brewery. The 1965 floods were particularly bad. The brewery operators made protective measures for the river reaching 23 feet, but the river soon reached 26 feet. This caused serious damage to the lower floors of the building, and the production equipment.

In 1971, Joseph Pickett purchased the brewery. He found that the brewery was not in good shape. Most of the equipment was outdated 1930s era equipment. The brewery had very low market share. Pickett began a massive renovation and modernization of the brewery.

Pickett introduced Pickett&#x27;s Premium beer, which by the late 1970s accounted for about 12% of sales in the region. The hospitality room was featured in the movie &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot;, as well as the 1981 comedy &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;.

Agri Industries purchased the brewery in 1980. They produced Rhomberg Beer until 1985. The beers made by the brewery were technically superior products, but the company had a limited advertising budget, which resulted in limited public exposure. The efforts were not successful, and the brewery closed in 1985. There were a couple more attempts in the following years to reopen the brewery. However, despite making superior products, the efforts were again not successful, and the brewery was closed down in 1999.

Between 1988 and 1998 or thereabout, the brewery was operated by Zele Brewing Company management. A number of contract brewing were made and the brewery showed promise. However, this was a period when large breweries choked distribution and forced their distributors to abandon micro breweries or craft beers, &quot;shake out period.&quot; This shake out period lasted between 1996 and 2003. During this period, Erlanger Beer Brand was owned by Stroh&#x27;s and it was a licensed product. It also brewed a private label for TGIF chain which increased its production to about 25,000 barrels or more a year. It also brewed under joint ventures for Tuan Chau Tien.

The city of Dubuque acquired the building through eminent domain proceedings as part of the riverfront renovation efforts. Work began to renovate the brewery. Madison, Wisconsin based Alexander Company was brought in to redevelop the site, however they were unable to bring any tenants in for the brewery.

On 23 March 2006, it was announced that Stone Cliff Winery had signed an agreement with Port of Dubuque LLC to lease part of the brewery. This lease was contingent on the city and Port of Dubuque signing a development deal. Under the lease, Stone Cliff Winery leased 10,000 feet of the ground floor for an expanded winery and tasting center - which they opened in the summer of 2007. The Dubuque Star brewing company is owned and operated by Jeffery Monroe in Iowa City, Iowa.

In April 2011, &quot;Ruhl&amp;Ruhl Realtors&quot; moved into the 3rd floor of the building.

As of 18 February 2013, &quot;The Star Restaurant&quot;, which was on the 2nd floor, is closed.

In 2014, &quot;Eagle Point Software&quot; moved into the 2nd floor of the building.

<doc id="671036" wikidata="Q8055678" url="?curid=671036" title="Yorkshire Bank">
<text>Yorkshire Bank is a trading name used by Clydesdale Bank plc for its retail banking operations in England.

The Yorkshire Bank was founded in 1859 as the West Riding of Yorkshire Provident Society and Penny Savings Society but the Provident Society was soon abandoned and the Bank then traded as the &quot;West Riding of Yorkshire Penny Savings Bank&quot;. After further abbreviations, its present name was adopted in 1959.

The Bank&#x27;s model was unique in that it directly owned an extensive network of penny banks, remitting funds into a Central Office. By the late nineteenth century, it was larger than any of the Trustee Savings Banks. However, the Bank faced a potential withdrawal of savings in 1911 and was acquired by a consortium of clearing banks.

The Bank was acquired by National Australia Bank (NAB) in 1990 and was merged into another NAB subsidiary, Clydesdale Bank in 2005, continuing to operate as a distinct trading division. In 2016 NAB divested its UK operations as CYBG plc which went on to acquire Virgin Money plc in 2018. Subsequently the Yorkshire Bank name was phased out with all branches rebranded as Virgin Money.

==History==
===Formation===

Colonel Edward Akroyd is regarded as the initiator of the Bank; he was a prominent Halifax industrialist, head of the family woollen firm of James Akroyd &amp; Son, magistrate and Member of Parliament. His philanthropic work led him to the importance of savings for the working class, much as the founders of the savings banks and early penny banks had done decades before. His original intention was to establish both a provident society and a penny bank within the same institution. In May 1856, Akroyd circulated a pamphlet to prominent figures in the county, leading to a public meeting in November at the Philosophical Hall, Leeds. A committee was formed to bring into being the West Riding of Yorkshire Provident Society and Penny Savings Society, with funds raised to finance both parts. In the event, the Provident Society proved uncompetitive with the large societies and it soon closed; the Bank then traded as the West Riding of Yorkshire Penny Savings Bank.

===The unique Yorkshire concept===

The Yorkshire Bank was different from other savings banks. At the bottom of the savings chain stood the penny banks, doing what their name implied: accepting very small sums from the poorest local people. As their funds increased, they would be deposited with the trustee savings banks. The relationship between the penny banks and the savings banks could be close, with a savings bank acting as a receiving agency for a number of penny banks in its area. (The Glasgow Savings Bank, for instance, had 97 of these by 1870.) What Akroyd envisaged was the Yorkshire forming and owning the local penny banks, and also being the receiving agent for their surplus funds. He began a campaign &quot;to form a great network of penny banks and provident societies in the West Riding, guaranteed by the local gentry and industrialists&quot;. Akroyd saw the advantage of a central co-ordinating body for penny banks in a wide district; this could have been found in the Trustee Savings Banks, but Akroyd distrusted them. He wanted freedom of investment of the funds, and recognised that they could not grow just from the savings of the poor: the Bank needed small traders also.

Considerable time was taken to establish the organisation. A key appointment in 1858 was of Peter Bent as accountant, later to become the Bank&#x27;s first general manager. Finally, in May 1859 the Central Office was ready and the Bank registered under the Friendly Society Acts. In the first month of its existence, two branches opened: Dewsbury and Oxenhope; by the end of the year there were 24 branches, and a year later there were 128, with total deposits of £23.000. These branches opened one evening a week, usually for an hour or two, and were generally known as &quot;evening branches&quot;. By the end of 1860 the abortive Provident Society had been abandoned and it was decided to extend the Bank coverage from the West Riding to the whole county.

===Incorporation and 19th century growth===

The 1863 Savings Act caused problems: the Bank was prevented from using the word &quot;savings&quot; in its title without being registered under the Act. Registration was not acceptable to the trustees, who did not want the restrictions it brought: e.g. on the maximum amount an individual investor could deposit (on the face of it, a strange objection from a penny bank). The Bank therefore opted for registration with the Board of Trade, but still had to drop the word &quot;savings&quot; from its name. By 1871, the Bank finally obtained its certificate of registration and duly changed its name to the Yorkshire Penny Bank.

In 1865, pressure of business in the Leeds branches had encouraged the Central Office to open a branch on its premises; unlike all the other branches, this opened daily. It was immediately successful: after one year, deposits were £2,000 and by 1870 they had risen to £25,000. Once the Bank had been registered, it used the Central Office branch as a model for the future branch structure. Gradually, additional daily branches were opened, starting with Bradford (1872), Halifax (1876) and Sheffield (1878). At the same time, new evening branches continued to be opened and these peaked at 955 in 1894; by then, there were 16 full branches and these more than doubled to 36 by 1900. Also from 1872, cheque books were introduced to encourage small traders to become customers and &quot;to dispel the common view that the Bank existed only for the small savings of children and the poorer classes&quot;. Despite that encouragement to small traders, the Bank actively encouraged accounts that had grown too large to switch to commercial banks.

With time came changes in the Bank&#x27;s leadership. Ackroyd resigned as President in 1879, and in 1891 Peter Bent died aged 64. He had become the first general manager in 1877 and under his guidance, deposits had risen to £5.7 million. This compared with the Glasgow Savings Bank, then the largest is the country, which had deposits &quot;in excess of £3 million&quot; in 1878. Bent&#x27;s son-in-law Henry Sellers took over and remained general manager until 1914. He introduced a stocks and shares department to the Bank and, as a result of the Boer War, developed a network of international correspondents. By 1908, deposits had risen to £17 million.

===The 1911 collapse===

In 1911, the Bank&#x27;s deposits of £18.5 million were supported by reserves of only £468,000. Although these deposits were repayable on demand, the funds were largely invested in fixed rate government securities, which, although liquid, fluctuated in value. The directors feared that a fall in the value of investments could threaten a run on the bank. In a rescue sponsored by the Bank of England, the Yorkshire Penny Bank was acquired by a consortium of eleven clearing banks. Additional capital of £11.5 million was injected into the Bank and further guarantees given to cover potential losses. The old Board was replaced and a new bank of the same name was formed. The eventual deficiency of £2.5 million was greater than the bank&#x27;s shareholders&#x27; guarantees, and further Government guarantees were obtained.

===Recovery===

Despite the Bank&#x27;s philanthropic origins, the new shareholders required it to be profitable. The operational limits of 10 miles over the border were removed and, in another change, overdrafts were allowed. However, the inter-war years were &quot;not distinguished by any great progress&quot;: between 1920 and 1932 deposits stood at around £29 million. In the late 1920s and early 1930s a few new branches were opened, and by 1939 deposits had grown to £39 million. However, it proved difficult to open new branches because of complaints from its shareholders that the Yorkshire was competing with their existing business. Helped by inflation, the Bank&#x27;s deposits rose to £95 million in 1948, the year that Henry Ashworth became general manager. However, the Bank was still trying to combine the strengths of the local penny banks with the requirements of a modern commercial institution. There were still 677 evening branches; these were deemed out of date and by 1955 only 79 remained. Instead, Ashworth wanted to increase lending to customers; and in 1959 the word &quot;Penny&quot;, widely thought to be off-putting to large customers, was finally dropped from the Bank&#x27;s title, leaving just the simple Yorkshire Bank Ltd.

===The 1952 reorganisation===

Despite Ashworth&#x27;s intentions, the bank&#x27;s funds were still largely invested in British Government securities (&quot;gilts&quot;); only 4 per cent of assets were in overdrafts. As in 1911, falling gilt values again threatened a substantial deficit, and by 1952 another increase in capital was required. Midland Bank held 37.5% of the shares and did not wish to continue, selling its holding to the other members of the consortium, now down to seven. The clearing bank mergers of 1968 further reduced the number of shareholders down to four: National Westminster, Barclays, Lloyds Bank and Williams &amp; Glyn. The shift in the asset structure continued and by 1970 overdrafts had reached £100, rising to £337 million in 1979, or 54% of assets, a far cry from the 4% of 1952.

===Yorkshire Bank Ltd===
In its centenary year of 1959, the bank&#x27;s name changed to Yorkshire Bank Limited. During the 1970s the bank became one of the first to offer fee free banking whilst in credit, a move that took bigger rivals a decade to follow. In 1982, it adopted public limited company status.

During the miners&#x27; strike from 1984 to 1985, the bank offered miners who were mortgage holders a deferment, allowing them to postpone payments for the duration of the dispute. The strike took place in the bank&#x27;s heartland and many miners were customers, having been encouraged by the National Coal Board to have their pay mandated to a bank account.

===Acquisition by National Australia Bank===
In 1990, the National Australia Bank Group acquired the bank from the consortium of owning banks which, after mergers and acquisitions, were the National Westminster Bank (holders of 40%), Barclays Bank (32%), Lloyds Bank (20%), and Royal Bank of Scotland (8%). The price paid was £1 billion and the bank joined National Australia Bank&#x27;s other European businesses, Clydesdale Bank (Scotland) and Northern Bank (which operated in both jurisdictions in Ireland).

In May 2005, the National Australia Bank announced its intention to merge the Yorkshire Bank with the Clydesdale under one operating licence, in which the former would be a trading name of the latter. Both operate under separate identities although the Clydesdale brand is the one that has been used in further expansion into the south of England (Northern Bank was sold to Danske Bank of Denmark along with its operations in the Republic of Ireland, the National Irish Bank). At the same time 40 branches were closed, a reduction of a fifth of the Yorkshire Bank network.

In 2006 underlying profit rose 16.7 per cent to £454 million compared with a year earlier, while post-tax earnings climbed 12.8 per cent to £229 million. Total income was up 8.7 per cent at £1,193 million, while net interest income climbed 14.6 per cent to £769 million.

In April 2012, National Australia Bank completed a strategic review of its businesses in the United Kingdom and decided to scale back operations, completely stopping Commercial Property Investment lending and closing 29 Financial Solutions Centres, with the resultant loss of 1,400 jobs over three years.

In July 2013, Yorkshire Bank forgot to renew its domain name, leading to customers being unable to log onto its website for a number of days. Yorkshire Bank blamed individual ISPs saying they had not refreshed their servers. On 2 September 2014 the bank suffered more IT related issues as its systems left customers unable to make or receive payments for a period of time.

===CYBG plc===
National Australia Bank confirmed in October 2014 that it planned to leave the United Kingdom and was considering a number of options for Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks, including a possible stock-market listing. In October 2015 NAB announced that it would float Clydesdale Bank plc, including Yorkshire Bank, on the London Stock Exchange in February 2016 through an initial public offering, with an aim of raising £2 billion.

Clydesdale Bank plc&#x27;s newly formed holding company CYBG plc began conditional trading on the LSE and the Australian Securities Exchange on 3 February 2016, and began trading unconditionally from 8 February 2016.

===Transition to Virgin Money===
In June 2018 CYBG plc announced it would acquire Virgin Money for £1.7 billion in an all-stock deal. Almost one in six employees were expected to lose their jobs in the takeover, which would result in retail customers being migrated to the Virgin Money brand over three years.

In June 2019 CYBG plc announced its plans to consolidate its businesses under the Virgin Money brand. B and Yorkshire Bank, which exist as trading divisions of Clydesdale Bank plc, would begin to use the Virgin Money name in early 2020 and Clydesdale Bank to use the new name between late 2020 and early 2021. In September 2019 Yorkshire Bank confirmed it would be leaving its Leeds headquarters, with two hundred employees being relocated to the bank&#x27;s flagship branch on Briggate. In preparation for rebranding, the existing Virgin Money plc was merged into the existing Clydesdale Bank plc on 21 October 2019.

<doc id="671039" wikidata="Q108728" url="?curid=671039" title="Linoleum">
<text>Linoleum is a floor covering made from materials such as solidified linseed oil (linoxyn), pine resin, ground cork dust, sawdust, and mineral fillers such as calcium carbonate, most commonly on a burlap or canvas backing. Pigments are often added to the materials to create the desired color finish. Commercially, the material has been largely replaced by sheet vinyl flooring, although in the UK and Australia this is often still referred to as &quot;lino&quot;.

The finest linoleum floors, known as &quot;inlaid&quot;, are extremely durable, and are made by joining and inlaying solid pieces of linoleum. Cheaper patterned linoleum comes in different grades or gauges, and is printed with thinner layers which are more prone to wear and tear. High-quality linoleum is flexible and thus can be used in buildings where a more rigid material (such as ceramic tile) would crack.

==Technology==

Linoleum in essence consists of two components, a polymerizable organic compound and a collection of fillers, pigments, catalysts. The polymerizable precursors are rich in polyunsaturated fats, especially derivatives of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. Such fats are called drying oils because they &quot;dry&quot; (harden) upon exposure to the oxygen in air. The drying process results in cross-linking of the fat molecules. This crosslinking process is often slow, thus catalysts and heat are applied to give a durable material. During this crosslinking, fillers and pigments are mixed with the resin.

== History ==

Linoleum was invented by Englishman Frederick Walton. In 1855, Walton happened to notice the rubbery, flexible skin of solidified linseed oil (linoxyn) that had formed on a can of oil-based paint and thought that it might form a substitute for India rubber. Raw linseed oil oxidizes very slowly, but Walton accelerated the process by heating it with lead acetate and zinc sulfate. This made the oil form a resinous mass into which lengths of cheap cotton cloth were dipped until a thick coating formed. The coating was then scraped off and boiled with benzene or similar solvents to form a varnish. Walton initially planned to sell his varnish to the makers of water-repellent fabrics such as oilcloth, and received Patent No. 209 on 27 January 1860 for the process. However, his method had problems: the cotton cloth soon fell apart, and it took months to produce enough of the linoxyn. Little interest was shown in Walton&#x27;s varnish. In addition, his first factory burned down, and he suffered from persistent and painful rashes.

Walton soon came up with an easier way to transfer the oil to the cotton sheets, by hanging them vertically and sprinkling the oil from above, and he tried mixing the linoxyn with sawdust and cork dust to make it less tacky. In 1863, he applied for a further patent, which read: &quot;For these purposes canvas or other suitable strong fabrics are coated over on their upper surfaces with a composition of oxidized oil, cork dust, and gum or resin ... such surfaces being afterward printed, embossed, or otherwise ornamented. The back or under surfaces of such fabrics are coated with a coating of such oxidized oils, or oxidized oils and gum or resin, and by preference without an admixture of cork.&quot;

At first, Walton called his invention &quot;Kampticon&quot;, which was deliberately close to Kamptulicon, the name of an existing floor covering, but he soon changed it to Linoleum, which he derived from the Latin words &quot;linum&quot; (flax) and &quot;oleum&quot; (oil). In 1864, he established the Linoleum Manufacturing Company Ltd., with a factory at Staines, near London. The new product did not prove immediately popular, mainly due to intense competition from the makers of Kamptulicon and oilcloth. The company operated at a loss for its first five years, until Walton began an intensive advertising campaign and opened two shops in London for the exclusive sale of Linoleum. Walton&#x27;s friend Jerimiah Clarke designed the linoleum patterns, typically with a Grecian urn motif around the borders.

Other inventors began their own experiments after Walton took out his patent, and in 1871, William Parnacott took out a patent for a method of producing linoxyn by blowing hot air into a tank of linseed oil for several hours, then cooling the material in trays. Unlike Walton&#x27;s process, which took weeks, Parnacott&#x27;s method took only a day or two, although the quality of the linoxyn was not as good. Despite this, many manufacturers opted to use the less expensive Parnacott process.

Walton soon faced competition from other manufacturers, including a company which bought the rights to Parnacott&#x27;s process, and launched its own floor covering, which it named Corticine, from the Latin &quot;cortex&quot; (bark or rind). Corticine was mainly made of cork dust and linoxyn without a cloth backing, and became popular because it was cheaper than linoleum.

By 1869, Walton&#x27;s factory in Staines, England was exporting to Europe and the United States. In 1877, the Scottish town of Kirkcaldy, in Fife, became the largest producer of linoleum in the world, with no fewer than six floorcloth manufacturers in the town, most notably Michael Nairn &amp; Co., which had been producing floor cloth since 1847.

Walton opened the American Linoleum Manufacturing Company in 1872 on Staten Island, in partnership with Joseph Wild, the company&#x27;s town being named Linoleumville (renamed Travis in 1930). It was the first U.S. linoleum manufacturer, but was soon followed by the American Nairn Linoleum Company, established by Sir Michael Nairn in 1887 (later the Congoleum-Nairn Company, and then the Congoleum Corporation of America), in Kearny, New Jersey. Congoleum now manufactures sheet vinyl and no longer has a linoleum line.

=== Loss of trademark protection ===
Walton was unhappy with Michael Nairn &amp; Co&#x27;s use of the name Linoleum and brought a lawsuit against them for trademark infringement. However, the term had not been trademarked, and he lost the suit, the court opining that even if the name &quot;had&quot; been registered as a trademark, it was by now so widely used that it had become generic, only 14 years after its invention. It is considered to be the first product name to become a generic term.

== Use == 
Between the time of its invention in 1860 and its being largely superseded by other hard floor coverings in the 1950s, linoleum was considered to be an excellent, inexpensive material for high-use areas. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was favoured in hallways and passages, and as a surround for carpet squares. However, most people associate linoleum with its common twentieth century use on kitchen floors. Its water resistance enabled easy maintenance of sanitary conditions and its resilience made standing easier and reduced breakage of dropped china.

Other products devised by Walton included Linoleum Muralis in 1877, which became better known as Lincrusta. Essentially a highly durable linoleum wall covering, Lincrusta could be manufactured to resemble carved plaster or wood, or even leather. It was very successful, and inspired a much cheaper imitation, Anaglypta, originally devised by one of Walton&#x27;s showroom managers.

Walton also tried integrating designs into linoleum during the manufacturing stage, coming up with granite, marbled, and jaspé (striped) linoleum. For the granite variety, granules of various colors of linoleum cement were mixed together, before being hot-rolled. If the granules were not completely mixed before rolling, the result was marbled or jaspé patterns.
Walton&#x27;s next product was inlaid linoleum, which resembled encaustic tiles, in 1882. Previously, linoleum had been produced in solid colors, with patterns printed on the surface if required. In inlaid linoleum, the colors extend all the way through to the backing cloth. Inlaid linoleum was made using a stencil type method where different-colored granules were placed in shaped metal trays, after which the sheets were run through heated rollers to fuse them to the backing cloth. In 1898, Walton devised a process for making straight-line inlaid linoleum that allowed for crisp, sharp geometric designs. This involved strips of uncured linoleum being cut and pieced together patchwork-fashion before being hot-rolled. Embossed inlaid linoleum was not introduced until 1926.

The heavier gauges of linoleum are known as &quot;battleship linoleum&quot;, and are mainly used in high-traffic situations like offices and public buildings. It was originally manufactured to meet the specifications of the U.S. Navy for warship deck covering on enclosed decks instead of wood, hence the name. Most U.S. Navy warships removed their linoleum deck coverings following the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they were considered too flammable. Use of linoleum persisted in U.S. Navy submarines.) Royal Navy warships used the similar product &quot;Corticine&quot;.

Early in the twentieth century, a group of Dresden artists used easy-to-cut linoleum instead of wood for printmaking, creating the linocut printmaking technique – similar to woodcuts. Prominent artists who created linocut prints included Picasso and Henri Matisse.

== Present day ==
As a floor covering, linoleum has often been replaced by polyvinyl chloride (PVC), referred to sometimes as vinyl. PVC has many properties that are superior to linoleum, including fire-resistance. Linoleum is still used in art for linocut prints. Linoleum is also considered an environmentally friendly alternative to PVC as it is derived from renewable, natural, biodegradable material.

<text>The Mississippi Braves, or M-Braves as they were referred to locally, were a Minor League Baseball team based in Pearl, Mississippi, a suburb of Jackson, from 2005 to 2024. They were the Double-A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves and competed in the Southern League. The M-Braves played their home games at Trustmark Park. After the 2024 season, the team relocated to Columbus, Georgia, to become the Columbus Clingstones.

==History==
In 2005, the Southern League&#x27;s Greenville Braves relocated to Pearl, Mississippi, from Greenville, South Carolina, due to the poor condition of Greenville Municipal Stadium, and the failure to reach an agreement with the Greenville County council for a new ballpark.

The M-Braves&#x27; first season began on April 18, 2005 at Trustmark Park with a loss to the Montgomery Biscuits.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Braves were organized into the Double-A South. They won the 2021 Southern Division title with a first-place 67–44 record. They qualified for the playoffs by having the best record in the league. The Braves defeated the Montgomery Biscuits, 3–2, in the best-of-five series to win the Double-A South championship. Shea Langeliers was selected as the league&#x27;s Top MLB Prospect and Dan Meyer as the Manager of the Year. 

In December 2021, Diamond Baseball Holdings bought the Mississippi Braves from Atlanta Braves owner Liberty Media.

In 2022, the Double-A South became known as the Southern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

In 2024, the Braves announced that the 2024 season would be their final season in Mississippi, and that they would be relocating to Columbus, Georgia, for the start of the 2025 season as the Columbus Clingstones.

==Championships==
On September 13, 2008, the Mississippi Braves beat the Carolina Mudcats, 3–2, in the 10th inning of the decisive Game 5 of the Southern League Championship Series. This was the M-Braves first championship and the first Southern League title for Atlanta&#x27;s Double-A franchise since 1997. The M-Braves&#x27; second title came in 2021 in the Double-A South.

==Television and radio==
All Mississippi Braves games were televised live on MiLB.TV. Since 2023, all regular and post-season Mississippi Braves games aired on 102.1 The Box. The broadcasters were Chris Harris and Jack Sadighian. From 2009 to 2022, games aired on WYAB 103.9 FM.

<text>The Castor River is divided into the Upper Castor River and the Lower Castor River by the Headwater Diversion Channel.

The Upper Castor rises in the southern corner of Ste. Genevieve County of southeast Missouri about ten miles north-northeast of Fredericktown. The river flows south through eastern Madison County into the eastern edge of Wayne County to Bollinger County where it empties into the Headwater Diversion Channel, which flows into the Mississippi River just south of Cape Girardeau.

The Lower Castor River south of the Diversion Channel flows south where it joins the Little River.

Castor is a name derived from French meaning &quot;beaver&quot;. The stream was mentioned by Henry Schoolcraft in his 1818 report on his exploration of southern Missouri.

<text>Bladud or Blaiddyd is a legendary king of the Britons, although there is no historical evidence for his existence. He is first mentioned in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; ( 1136), which describes him as the son of King Rud Hud Hudibras, and the tenth ruler in line from the first king, Brutus, saying Bladud was contemporaneous with the biblical prophet Elijah (9th century BC).

A Bleydiud son of Caratauc is mentioned in the Welsh Harley MS 3859 genealogies (in the British Library), suggesting to some that Geoffrey misinterpreted a scrap of Welsh genealogy (such as the Harleian genealogies itself or a related text). The Welsh form of the name is given as &quot;Blaiddyd&quot; in manuscripts of the &quot;Brut Tysilio&quot; (Welsh translations of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;). The meaning of the name is &quot;Wolf-lord&quot; (Welsh &quot;blaidd&quot; &quot;wolf&quot; + &quot;iudd&quot; &quot;lord&quot;). In the text he is said to have founded the city of Bath. He was succeeded by his son Leir (the Shakespearean King Lear).

The tale of Bladud was later embellished by other authors, such as John Hardyng and John Higgins, writing in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

==Legend==

According to the final form of the legend, which appeared in John Hardyng&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; of 1457, Bladud&#x27;s father sent his son to be educated in the liberal arts in Athens. After his father&#x27;s death he returned with four philosophers, and founded a university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, which flourished until Saint Augustine of Canterbury suppressed it on account of heresies which were taught there.

Supposedly he ruled for twenty years from 863 BC or perhaps 500 BC, in which time he built Kaerbadum or Caervaddon (Bath), creating the hot springs there by the use of magic. He dedicated the city to the goddess Athena and in honour of her, lit undying fires, whose flames turned to balls of stone as they grew low, with new ones springing up in their stead: an embellishment of an account from the third-century writer Solinus of the use of local coal on the altars of her temple.

===Leprosy===

Bladud supposedly founded the city of Bath because, while he was in Athens, he contracted
leprosy; when he returned home he was imprisoned as a result, but escaped and went far off to go into hiding. He found employment as a swineherd at Swainswick (&quot;Swineswick&quot;), about two miles from the later site of Bath, and noticed that his pigs would go into an alder-moor in cold weather and return covered in black mud.

He found that this mud was warm, and that the pigs wallowed to enjoy the heat. He also noticed that the pigs which did this did not suffer from skin diseases as others did, and on trying the mud-bath himself found that he was cured of his leprosy. He was then restored to his position as heir-apparent to his father, and founded Bath so that others might also benefit as he had done.

The story of Bladud&#x27;s cure-by-immersion was much exploited when Bath became a fashionable spa resort. The statue of King Bladud overlooking the King&#x27;s Bath at Bath carries the date of 1699, but it is much older than this. It was assembled from parts of two statues (respectively depicting Edward III and Bladud himself) previously mounted on the city&#x27;s north and south gates; its pitted appearance from weathering enhanced the association with disease.

In the eighteenth century Bladud&#x27;s legendary cure was celebrated by John Wood, the architect responsible for the fashionable development of Bath, who incorporated many references to the king in his buildings.

===Divination, wings and death===

The tale claims that Bladud also encouraged the practice of necromancy, or divination through the spirits of the dead. Through this practice, he is said to have constructed wings for himself and to have tried to fly to (or from) the temple of Apollo in Trinovantum (London) or Troja Nova (New Troy), but to have been killed when he hit a wall, or to have fallen and been dashed to pieces or to have broken his neck. He was supposedly buried at New Troy and succeeded by his son, Leir.

==Conflation with Abaris the Hyperborean==
Eighteenth century Bath architect John Wood wrote about Bladud, and put forth the fanciful suggestion that he should be identified with Abaris the Hyperborean, the healer known from Classical Greek sources.

==In fiction==
Vera Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Blaedud the Birdman&quot; is a fantasy novel about the character.

Moyra Caldecott&#x27;s &quot;The Winged Man&quot; is a fictional account of the life of Bladud.

Bladud, styled Blaiddyd, is a legendary hero in &quot;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&quot;.

The narrator of Stephen Lawhead&#x27;s second Song of Albion book (&quot;The Silver Hand&quot;, 1992 ), Tegid Tathal, Chief Bard of Albion, is asked by the god Gofannon to tell the story of &quot;Bladudd the Blemished&quot; which he does in the way of myth, presenting it as an classic teaching story about sovereignty and mental/ physical purity.

The legend is reproduced with some artistic interpretation as a short story in Charles Dickens novel “The Pickwick Papers”, as the main character is visiting Bath.

==Notes==

a. Pronunciation: As a mythological figure, there is no definitive pronunciation, but in modern English it is . In the Brythonic language of the time the &quot;dd&quot; of &quot;Blaiddyd&quot; would have been pronounced , which has allowed some authors to call him &quot;Bathulf, the founder of Bath&quot;.

Although she lists Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and Ornette Coleman as her primary influences, her playing is also reminiscent of McCoy Tyner and contemporaries such as Kenny Kirkland and Mulgrew Miller.

Onishi appeared in the documentary &quot;Blue Note: A Story of Modern Jazz&quot; (1997), playing the song &quot;Trinity&quot; (&quot;Quick&quot;) from her album &quot;Play, Piano, Play&quot;.

==Hiatus and later career==
Onishi stopped performing in the late 1990s, having chosen to study and practice. When Jaki Byard, her mentor at that time, died in 1999, she stopped playing completely for two years: &quot;I felt like I lost everything; I felt like I didn&#x27;t have any more mentors&quot;. She had to redevelop her technique when she decided to return, and started going to a gym to help her cope with the physical demands of playing.

Blue Note released her trio album, &quot;Musical Moments&quot; in 2009. &quot;Baroque&quot; (Verve), with Onishi leading a much larger group, followed a year later.

<doc id="671090" wikidata="Q386377" url="?curid=671090" title="Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment">
<text>The Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment was conducted by physicists Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956. The experiment confirmed the existence of neutrinos. Neutrinos, subatomic particles with no electric charge and very small mass, had been conjectured to be an essential particle in beta decay processes in the 1930s. With neither mass nor charge, such particles appeared to be impossible to detect. The experiment exploited a huge flux of (then hypothetical) electron antineutrinos emanating from a nearby nuclear reactor and a detector consisting of large tanks of water. Neutrino interactions with the protons of the water were observed, verifying the existence and basic properties of this particle for the first time.

==Background==
During the 1910s and 1920s, the observations of electrons from the nuclear beta decay showed that their energy had a continuous distribution. If the process involved only the atomic nucleus and the electron, the electron&#x27;s energy would have a single, narrow peak, rather than a continuous energy spectrum. Only the resulting electron was observed, so its varying energy suggested that energy may not be conserved. This quandary and other factors led Wolfgang Pauli to attempt to resolve the issue by postulating the existence of the neutrino in 1930. If the fundamental principle of energy conservation was to be preserved, beta decay had to be a three-body, rather than a two-body, decay. Therefore, in addition to an electron, Pauli suggested that another particle was emitted from the atomic nucleus in beta decay. This particle, the neutrino, had very small mass and no electric charge; it was not observed, but it carried the missing energy.

Pauli&#x27;s suggestion was developed into a proposed theory for beta decay by Enrico Fermi in 1933. The theory posits that the beta decay process consists of four fermions directly interacting with one another. By this interaction, the neutron decays directly to an electron, the conjectured
neutrino (later determined to be an antineutrino) and a proton. The theory, which proved to be remarkably successful, relied on the existence of the hypothetical neutrino. Fermi first submitted his &quot;tentative&quot; theory of beta decay to the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, which rejected it &quot;because it contained speculations too remote from reality to be of interest to the reader.&quot;

One problem with the neutrino conjecture and Fermi&#x27;s theory was that the neutrino appeared to have such weak interactions with other matter that it would never be observed. In a 1934 paper, Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth without interactions with any matter.

==Potential for experiment==
By inverse beta decay, the predicted neutrino, more correctly an electron antineutrino (formula_1), should interact with a proton () to produce a neutron () and positron (formula_2),

:formula_3

The chance of this reaction occurring was small. The probability for any given reaction to occur is in proportion to its cross section. Cowan and Reines predicted a cross section for the reaction to be about . The usual unit for a cross section in nuclear physics is a barn, which is and 20 orders of magnitudes larger.

Despite the low probability of the neutrino interaction, the signatures of the interaction are unique, making detection of the rare interactions possible. The positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron, quickly interacts with any nearby electron, and they annihilate each other. The two resulting coincident gamma rays () are detectable. The neutron can be detected by its capture by an appropriate nucleus, releasing a third gamma ray. The coincidence of the positron annihilation and neutron capture events gives a unique signature of an antineutrino interaction.

A water molecule is composed of an oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, and most of the hydrogen atoms of water have a single proton for a nucleus. Those protons can serve as targets for antineutrinos, so that simple water can serve as a primary detecting material. The hydrogen atoms are so weakly bound in water that they can be viewed as free protons for the neutrino interaction. The interaction mechanism of neutrinos with heavier nuclei, those with several protons and neutrons, is more complicated, since the constituent protons are strongly bound within the nuclei.

==Setup==

Given the small chance of interaction of a single neutrino with a proton, neutrinos could only be observed using a huge neutrino flux. Beginning in 1951, Cowan and Reines, both then scientists at Los Alamos, New Mexico, initially thought that neutrino bursts from the atomic weapons tests that were then occurring could provide the required flux. For a neutrino source, they proposed using an atomic bomb. Permission for this was obtained from the laboratory director, Norris Bradbury. The plan was to detonate a &quot;20-kiloton nuclear bomb, comparable to that dropped on Hiroshima, Japan&quot;. The detector was proposed to be dropped at the moment of explosion into a hole 40 meters from the detonation site &quot;to catch the flux at its maximum&quot;; it was named &quot;El Monstro&quot;. They eventually used a nuclear reactor as a source of neutrinos, as advised by Los Alamos physics division leader J.M.B. Kellogg. The reactor had a neutrino flux of neutrinos per second per square centimeter, far higher than any flux attainable from other radioactive sources. The source specifically was beta minus decay from fission products, creating electron antineutrinos, for example in the fission production iodine-131:

&lt;chem&gt;^{131}_{53}I -&gt; ^{131}_{54}Xe^\ast{} + \beta^{-} + \bar\nu_e + 606 keV&lt;/chem&gt;

A detector consisting of two tanks of water was employed, offering a huge number of potential targets in the protons of the water. At those rare instances when neutrinos interacted with protons in the water, neutrons and positrons were created:

formula_3

or rather

&lt;chem&gt;\bar{\nu}_{e} + H2O \to OH^{-}{} + n{} + e^+&lt;/chem&gt;

Electron–positron annihilation then occurs:

&lt;chem&gt;e^{+}{} + e^{-} \to 2\gamma_{511 keV}&lt;/chem&gt;

The two gamma rays created by positron annihilation were detected by sandwiching the water tanks between tanks filled with liquid scintillator. The scintillator material gives off flashes of light in response to the gamma rays, and these light flashes are detected by photomultiplier tubes. The scintillator used was the wavelength shifter POPOP, which peaks in violet light:

&lt;chem&gt;\gamma_{511 keV} \ + C24H16N2O2 \to C24H16N2O2 \ + A \gamma_{3 eV} &lt;/chem&gt;

The additional detection of the neutron from the neutrino interaction provided a second layer of certainty. Cowan and Reines detected the neutrons by dissolving cadmium chloride, CdCl2, in the tank. Cadmium is a highly effective neutron absorber and gives off a gamma ray when it absorbs a neutron.

The arrangement was such that after a neutrino interaction event, the two gamma rays from the positron annihilation would be detected, followed by the gamma ray from the neutron absorption by cadmium several microseconds later.

The experiment that Cowan and Reines devised used two tanks with a total of about 200 liters of water with about 40 kg of dissolved CdCl2. The water tanks were sandwiched between three scintillator layers which contained 110 five-inch (127 mm) photomultiplier tubes.

==Results==

In 1953, Cowan and Reines built a detector they dubbed &quot;Herr Auge&quot;, &quot;Mr. Eye&quot; in German. They called the neutrino-searching experiment &quot;Project Poltergeist&quot;, because of &quot;the neutrino’s ghostly nature&quot;. A preliminary experiment was performed in 1953 at the Hanford Site in Washington state, but in late 1955 the experiment moved to the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, South Carolina. The Savannah River site had better shielding against cosmic rays. This shielded location was 11 m from the reactor and 12 m underground.

After months of data collection, the accumulated data showed about three neutrino interactions per hour in the detector. To be absolutely sure that they were seeing neutrino events from the detection scheme described above, Cowan and Reines shut down the reactor to show that there was a difference in the rate of detected events.

They had predicted a cross-section for the reaction to be about and their measured cross-section was . The results were published in the July 20, 1956 issue of Science.

==Legacy==
Clyde Cowan died in 1974 at the age of 54. In 1995, Frederick Reines was honored with the Nobel Prize for his work on neutrino physics.

The basic strategy of employing massive detectors, often water based, for neutrino research was exploited by several subsequent experiments, including the Irvine–Michigan–Brookhaven detector, Kamiokande, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and the Homestake Experiment. The Homestake Experiment is a contemporary experiment which detected neutrinos from nuclear fusion in the solar core. Observatories such as these detected neutrino bursts from supernova SN 1987A in 1987, the birth 
of neutrino astronomy. Through observations of solar neutrinos, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory was able to demonstrate the process of neutrino oscillation. Neutrino oscillation shows that neutrinos are not massless, a profound development in particle physics.

<text>The Flixborough disaster was an explosion at a chemical plant close to the village of Flixborough, North Lincolnshire, England, on Saturday, 1 June 1974. It killed 28 and seriously injured 36 of the 72 people on site at the time. The casualty figures could have been much higher if the explosion had occurred on a weekday, when the main office area would have been occupied. A contemporary campaigner on process safety wrote &quot;the shock waves rattled the confidence of every chemical engineer in the country&quot;.

The disaster involved (and may well have been caused by) a hasty equipment modification. Although virtually all of the plant management personnel had chemical engineering qualifications, there was no on-site senior manager with mechanical engineering expertise. Mechanical engineering issues with the modification were overlooked by the managers who approved it, and the severity of potential consequences due to its failure were not taken into account.

Flixborough led to a widespread public outcry over process safety. Together with the passage of the UK Health and Safety at Work Act in the same year, it led to (and is often quoted in justification of) a more systematic approach to process safety in UK process industries. UK government regulation of plant processing or storing large inventories of hazardous materials is currently under the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 (COMAH). In Europe, the Flixborough disaster and the Seveso disaster in 1976 led to development of the Seveso Directive in 1982 (currently Directive 2012/18/EU issued in 2012).

==Overview==

The chemical works, owned by Nypro UK (a joint venture between Dutch State Mines (DSM) and the British National Coal Board (NCB)) had originally produced fertiliser from by-products of the coke ovens of a nearby steelworks. Since 1967, it had instead produced caprolactam, a chemical used in the manufacture of nylon 6. The caprolactam was produced from cyclohexanone. This was originally produced by hydrogenation of phenol, but in 1972 additional capacity was added, built to a DSM design in which hot liquid cyclohexane was partially oxidised by compressed air. The plant was intended to produce 70,000 tons per annum (tpa) of caprolactam but was reaching a rate of only 47,000 tpa in early 1974. Government controls on the price of caprolactam put further financial pressure on the plant.

It was a failure of the cyclohexane plant that led to the disaster. A major leak of liquid from the reactor circuit caused the rapid formation of a large cloud of flammable hydrocarbon. When this met an ignition source (probably a furnace at a nearby hydrogen production plant) there was a massive fuel-air explosion. The plant control room collapsed, killing all 18 occupants. Nine other site workers were killed, and a delivery driver died of a heart attack in his cab. Fires started on-site which were still burning ten days later. Around 1,000 buildings within a radius of the site (in Flixborough itself and in the neighbouring villages of Burton upon Stather and Amcotts) were damaged, as were nearly 800 in Scunthorpe away; the blast was heard over away in Grimsby, Hull and Saltfleet. Images of the disaster were soon shown on television, filmed by BBC and Yorkshire Television filmstock news crews who had been covering the Appleby-Frodingham Gala in Scunthorpe that afternoon.

The plant was re-built but cyclohexanone was now produced by hydrogenation of phenol (Nypro proposed to produce the hydrogen from LPG; in the absence of timely advice from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) planning permission for storage of 1,200 te LPG at Flixborough was initially granted subject to HSE approval, but HSE objected); as a result of a subsequent collapse in the price of nylon it closed down a few years later. The site was demolished in 1981, although the administration block still remains. The site today is home to the Flixborough Industrial Estate, occupied by various businesses and Glanford Power Station.

The foundations of properties severely damaged by the blast and subsequently demolished can be found on land between the estate and the village, on the route known as Stather Road. A memorial to those who died was erected in front of offices at the rebuilt site in 1977. Cast in bronze, it showed mallards alighting on water. When the plant was closed, the statue was moved to the pond at the parish church in Flixborough. During the early hours of New Year&#x27;s Day 1984, the sculpture was stolen. It has never been recovered but the plinth it stood on, with a plaque listing all those who died that day, can still be found outside the church.

The cyclohexane oxidation process is still operated in much the same plant design in the Far East.

==The disaster==
===The plant===
In the DSM process, cyclohexane was heated to about 155 °C (311 °F) before passing into a series of six reactors. The reactors were constructed from mild steel with a stainless steel lining; when operating they held in total about 145 tonnes of flammable liquid at a working pressure of 8.6 bar gauge (0.86 MPa gauge; 125 psig). In each of the reactors, compressed air was passed through the cyclohexane, causing a small percentage of the cyclohexane to oxidise and produce cyclohexanone, some cyclohexanol also being produced. Each reactor was slightly (approximately 14 inches, 350 mm) lower than the previous one, so that the reaction mixture flowed from one to the next by gravity through nominal 28-inch bore (700mm DN) stub pipes with inset bellows. The inlet to each reactor was baffled so that liquid entered the reactors at a low level; the exiting liquid flowed over a weir whose crest was somewhat higher than the top of the outlet pipe. The mixture exiting reactor 6 was processed to remove reaction products, and the unreacted cyclohexane (only about 6% was reacted in each pass) then returned to the start of the reactor loop.

Although the operating pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled bleed valve once the plant had reached steady state, the valve could not be used during start-up, when there was no air feed, the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the bleed valve was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider than those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of vent valves). A pressure-relief valve acting at gauge was also fitted.

===Reactor 5 leaks and is bypassed===
Two months prior to the explosion, the number 5 reactor was discovered to be leaking. When lagging was stripped from it, a crack extending about was visible in the mild steel shell of the reactor. It was decided to install a temporary pipe to bypass the leaking reactor to allow continued operation of the plant while repairs were made. In the absence of 28-inch nominal bore pipe (700mm DN), 20-inch nominal bore pipe (500mm DN) was used to fabricate the bypass pipe for linking reactor 4 outlet to reactor 6 inlet. The new configuration was tested for leak-tightness at working pressure by pressurisation with nitrogen. For two months after fitting the bypass was operated continuously at temperature and pressure and gave no trouble. At the end of May (by which time the bypass had been lagged) the reactors had to be depressurised and allowed to cool in order to deal with leaks elsewhere. The leaks having been dealt with, early on 1 June attempts began to bring the plant back up to pressure and temperature.

===The explosion===
At about 16:53 on 1 June 1974, there was a massive release of hot cyclohexane in the area of the missing reactor 5, followed shortly by ignition of the resulting huge cloud of flammable vapour and a massive explosion in the plant. The explosion virtually demolished the site. As it was a weekend there were relatively few people on site: of the 72 people on-site at the time, 28 were killed and 36 injured. Fires burned on-site for more than ten days. Off-site there were no fatalities, but 50 injuries were reported and about 2,000 properties damaged.

The occupants of the works laboratory had seen the release and evacuated the building before the release ignited; most survived. None of the 18 occupants of the plant control room survived, nor did any records of plant readings. The explosion appeared to have been in the general area of the reactors and after the accident only two possible sites for leaks before the explosion were identified: &quot;the 20 inch bypass assembly with the bellows at both ends torn asunder was found jack-knifed on the plinth beneath&quot; and there was a 50-inch long split in nearby 8-inch nominal bore stainless steel pipework&quot;.

==Court of Inquiry==
Immediately after the accident, &quot;New Scientist&quot; commented presciently on the normal official response to such events, but hoped that the opportunity would be taken to introduce effective government regulation of hazardous process plants.
The Secretary of State for Employment set up a Court of Inquiry to establish the causes and circumstances of the disaster and identify any immediate lessons to be learned, and also an expert committee to identify major hazard sites and advise on appropriate measures of control for them. The inquiry, chaired by Roger Parker QC, sat for 70 days in the period September 1974 – February 1975, and took evidence from over 170 witnesses. In parallel, an Advisory Committee on Major Hazards was set up to look at the longer-term issues associated with hazardous process plants.

===Circumstances of the disaster===
The report of the court of inquiry was critical of the installation of the bypass pipework on a number of counts: although plant and senior management were chartered engineers (mostly chemical engineers), the post of Works Engineer which had been occupied by a chartered mechanical engineer had been vacant since January 1974, and at the time of the accident there were no professionally qualified engineers in the works engineering department. Nypro had recognised this to be a weakness and identified a senior mechanical engineer in an NCB subsidiary as available to provide advice and support if requested. At a meeting of plant and engineering managers to discuss the failure of reactor 5, the external mechanical engineer was not present. The emphasis was upon prompt restart and – the inquiry felt – although this did not lead to the deliberate acceptance of hazards, it led to the adoption of a course of action whose hazards (and indeed engineering practicalities) were not adequately considered or understood. The major problem was thought to be getting reactor 5 moved out of the way. Only the plant engineer was concerned about restarting before the reason for the failure was understood, and the other reactors inspected. The difference in elevation between reactor 4 outlet and reactor 6 inlet was not recognised at the meeting. At a working level the offset was accommodated by a dog-leg in the bypass assembly; a section sloping downwards inserted between (and joined with by mitre welds) two horizontal lengths of 20-inch pipe abutting the existing 28-inch stubs. This bypass was supported by scaffolding fitted with supports provided to prevent the bellows having to take the weight of the pipework between them, but with no provision against other loadings. The Inquiry noted on the design of the assembly:
The Inquiry noted further that &quot;there was no overall control or planning of the design, construction, testing or fitting of the assembly nor was any check made that the operations had been properly carried out&quot;. After the assembly was fitted, the plant was tested for leak-tightness by pressurising with nitrogen to 9 kg/cm2; i.e. roughly operating pressure, but below the pressure at which the system relief valve would lift and below the 30% above design pressure called for by the relevant British Standard.

===Cause of the disaster===
The claim argued by experts retained by Nypro and their insurers was that the disaster&#x27;s cause was that the 20-inch bypass was not what would have been produced or accepted by a more considered process. Controversy developed (and became acrimonious) as to whether its failure was the initiating fault in the disaster (the 20-inch hypothesis, argued by the plant designers (DSM) and the plant constructors; and favoured by the court&#x27;s technical advisers), or had been triggered by an external explosion resulting from a previous failure of the 8-inch line.

====The 20-inch hypothesis====
Tests on replica bypass assemblies showed that deformation of the bellows could occur at pressures below the safety valve setting, but that this deformation did not lead to a leak (either from damage to the bellows or from damage to the pipe at the mitre welds) until well above the safety valve setting. However theoretical modelling suggested that the expansion of the bellows as a result of this would lead to a significant amount of work being done on them by the reactor contents, and there would be considerable shock loading on the bellows when they reached the end of their travel. If the bellows were &#x27;stiff&#x27; (resistant to deformation), the shock loading could cause the bellows to tear at pressures below the safety valve setting; it was not impossible that this could occur at pressures experienced during start-up, when pressure was less tightly controlled. (Plant pressures at the time of the accident were unknown since all relevant instruments and records had been destroyed, and all relevant operators killed). The Inquiry concluded that this (&quot;the 20-inch hypothesis&quot;) was &#x27;a probability&#x27; but one &#x27;which would readily be displaced if some greater probability&#x27; could be found.

====The 8-inch hypothesis====
Detailed analysis suggested that the 8-inch pipe had failed due to &quot;creep cavitation&quot; at a high temperature while the pipe was under pressure. The metal of the pipe would have experienced hard-to-detect deformation, microscopic cracks, and structural weakness as a result, increasing the likelihood of failure. Failure had been accelerated by contact with molten zinc; there were indications that an elbow in the pipe had been at significantly higher temperature than the rest of the pipe. The hot elbow led to a non-return valve held between two pipe flanges by twelve bolts. After the disaster, two of the twelve bolts were found to be loose; the inquiry concluded that they were probably loose before the disaster. Nypro argued that the bolts had been loose, there had consequently been a slow leak of process fluid onto lagging leading eventually to a lagging fire, which had worsened the leak to the point where a flame had played undetected upon the elbow, burnt away its lagging and exposed the line to molten zinc, the line then failing with a bulk release of process fluid which extinguished the original fire, but subsequently ignited giving a small explosion which had caused failure of the bypass, a second larger release and a larger explosion. Tests failed to produce a lagging fire with leaked process fluid at process temperatures; one advocate of the 8-inch hypothesis then argued instead that there had been a gasket failure giving a leak with sufficient velocity to induce static charges whose discharge had then ignited the leak.

====The inquiry conclusion====
The 8-inch hypothesis was claimed to be supported by eyewitness accounts and by the apparently anomalous position of some debris post-disaster. The inquiry report took the view that explosions frequently throw debris in unexpected directions and eyewitnesses often have confused recollections. The inquiry identified difficulties at various stages of the accident development in the 8-inch hypothesis, their cumulative effect being considered to be such that the report concluded that overall the 20-inch hypothesis involving &#x27;a single event of low probability&#x27; was more credible than the 8-inch hypothesis depending upon &#x27;a succession of events, most of which are improbable&#x27;.

===Lessons to be learned===
The inquiry report identified &#x27;lessons to be learned&#x27; which it presented under various headings; &#x27;General observation&#x27; (relating to cultural issues underlying the disaster), &#x27;specific lessons&#x27; (directly relevant to the disaster, but of general applicability) are reported below; there were also &#x27;general&#x27; and &#x27;miscellaneous lessons&#x27; of less relevance to the disaster. The report also commented on matters to be covered by the Advisory Committee on Major Hazards.

====General observation====
*Plant – where possible – should be designed so that failure does not lead to disaster on a timescale too short to permit corrective action.
*Plant should be designed and run to minimise the rate at which critical management decisions arise (particularly those in which production and safety conflict).
*Feedback within the management structure should ensure that top management understand the responsibilities of individuals and can ensure that their workload, capacity and competence allow them to effectively deal with those responsibilities

====Specific lessons====
The disaster was caused by &#x27;a well designed and constructed plant&#x27; undergoing a modification that destroyed its mechanical integrity.
*Modifications should be designed, constructed, tested and maintained to the same standards as the original plant

When the bypass was installed, there was no works engineer in post and company senior personnel (all chemical engineers) were incapable of recognising the existence of a simple engineering problem, let alone solving it
*When an important post is vacant, special care should be taken when decisions have to be taken which would normally be taken by or on the advice of the holder of the vacant post
*All engineers should learn at least the elements of branches of engineering other than their own

====Matters to be referred to the Advisory Committee====
No one concerned in the design or construction of the plant envisaged the possibility of a major disaster happening instantaneously. It was now apparent that such a possibility exists where large amounts of potentially explosive material are processed or stored. It was &#x27;of the greatest importance that plants at which there is a risk of instant as opposed to escalating disaster be identified. Once identified measures should be taken both to prevent such a disaster so far as is possible and to minimise its consequences should it occur despite all precautions.&#x27; There should be coordination between planning authorities and the Health and Safety Executive, so that planning authorities could be advised on safety issues before granting planning permission; similarly the emergency services should have information to draw up a disaster plan.

===Conclusion===
The inquiry summarised its findings as follows:

==Response to Inquiry Report==

===Controversy as to immediate cause===
Nypro&#x27;s advisers had put considerable effort into the 8-inch hypothesis, and the inquiry report put considerable effort into discounting it. The critique of the hypothesis spilled over into criticism of its advocates: &#x27;the enthusiasm for the 8-inch hypothesis felt by its proponents has led them to overlook obvious defects which in other circumstances they would not have failed to realise&#x27;. Of one proponent the report noted gratuitously that his examination by the court &#x27;was directed to ensuring that we had correctly appreciated the main steps in the hypothesis some of which appeared to us in conflict with facts which were beyond dispute&#x27;. The report thanked him for his work in assembling eyewitness evidence but said his use of it showed &#x27;an approach to the evidence which is wholly unsound&#x27;.

The proponent of the 8-inch gasket failure hypothesis responded by arguing that the 20-inch hypothesis had its share of defects which the inquiry report had chosen to overlook, that the 8-inch hypothesis had more in its favour than the report suggested, and that there were important lessons that the inquiry had failed to identify:

The HSE website as of 2014 said that &quot;During the late afternoon on 1 June 1974 a 20 inch bypass system ruptured, which may have been caused by a fire on a nearby 8-inch pipe&quot;. In the absence of a strong consensus for either hypothesis other possible immediate causes have been suggested.

====Post-enquiry forensic engineering – two-stage rupture of bypass====
The enquiry noted the existence of a small tear in a bellows fragment, and therefore considered the possibility of a small leak from the bypass having led to an explosion bringing the bypass down. It noted this to be not inconsistent with eyewitness evidence, but ruled out the scenario because pressure tests showed the bellows did not develop tears until well above the safety valve pressure. This hypothesis has however been revived, with the tears being caused by fatigue failure at the top of the reactor 4 outlet bellows because of flow-induced vibration of the unsupported bypass line. Finite element analysis has been carried out (and suitable eyewitness evidence adduced) to support this hypothesis.

====Post-enquiry forensic engineering – the &#x27;water hypothesis&#x27;====
The reactors were normally mechanically stirred but reactor 4 had operated without a working stirrer since November 1973; free phase water could have settled out in unstirred reactor 4 and the bottom of reactor 4 would reach operating temperature more slowly than the stirred reactors. It was postulated that there had been bulk water in reactor 4 and a disruptive boiling event had occurred when the interface between it and the reaction mixture reached operating temperature. Abnormal pressures and liquor displacement resulting from this (it was argued) could have triggered failure of the 20-inch bypass.

===Dissatisfaction with other aspects of the Inquiry Report===
The plant design had assumed that the worst consequence of a major leak would be a plant fire and to protect against this a fire detection system had been installed. Tests by the Fire Research Establishment had shown this to be less effective than intended. Moreover, fire detection only worked if the leak ignited at the leak site; it gave no protection against a major leak with delayed ignition, and the disaster had shown this could lead to multiple worker fatalities. The plant &quot;as designed&quot; therefore could be destroyed by a single failure and had a much greater risk of killing workers than the designers had intended. Critics of the inquiry report therefore found it hard to accept its characterisation of the plant as &#x27;well-designed&#x27;. The HSE (through the Department of Employment) had come up with a &#x27;shopping list&#x27; of about 30 recommendations on plant design, many of which had not been adopted (and a few explicitly rejected) by the Inquiry Report; the HSE inspector who acted as secretary to the inquiry spoke afterwards of making sure that the real lessons were acted upon. More fundamentally, Trevor Kletz saw the plant as symptomatic of a general failure to consider safety early enough in process plant design, so that designs were inherently safe – instead processes and plant were selected on other grounds then safety systems bolted on to a design with avoidable hazards and unnecessarily high inventory. &#x27;We keep a lion and build a strong cage to keep it in. But before we do so we should ask if a lamb might do.&#x27;

If the UK public were largely reassured to be told the accident was a one-off and should never happen again, some UK process safety practitioners were less confident. Critics felt that the Flixborough explosion was not the result of multiple basic engineering design errors unlikely to coincide again; the errors were rather multiple instances of one underlying cause: a complete breakdown of plant safety procedures (exacerbated by a lack of relevant engineering expertise, but that lack was also a procedural shortcoming).

==ICI Petrochemicals response==
The Petrochemicals Division of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) operated many plants with large inventories of flammable chemicals at its Wilton site (including one in which cyclohexane was oxidised to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol). Historically good process safety performance at Wilton had been marred in the late 1960s by a spate of fatal fires caused by faulty isolations/handovers for maintenance work. Their immediate cause was human error but ICI felt that saying that most accidents were caused by human error was no more useful than saying that most falls are caused by gravity. ICI had not simply reminded operators to be more careful, but issued explicit instructions on the required quality of isolations, and the required quality of its documentation. The more onerous requirements were justified as follows:

In accordance with this view, post-Flixborough (and without waiting for the Inquiry Report), ICI Petrochemicals instituted a review of how it controlled modifications. It found that major projects requiring financial sanction at a high level were generally well-controlled, but for more (financially) minor modifications there was less control and this had resulted in a past history of &#x27;near-misses&#x27; and small-scale accidents, few of which could be blamed on chemical engineers. To remedy this, not only were employees reminded of the principal points to consider when making a modification (both on the quality/compliance of the modification itself and on the effect of the modification on the rest of the plant), but new procedures and documentation were introduced to ensure adequate scrutiny. These requirements applied not only to changes to equipment, but also to process changes. All modifications were to be supported by a formal safety assessment. For major modifications this would include an &#x27;operability study&#x27;; for minor modifications a checklist-based safety assessment was to be used, indicating what aspects would be affected, and for each aspect giving a statement of the expected effect. The modification and its supporting safety assessment then had to be approved in writing by the plant manager and engineer. Where instruments or electrical equipment were involved signatures would also be needed from the relative specialist (instrument manager or electrical engineer). A Pipework Code of Practice was introduced specifying standards of design construction and maintenance for pipework – all pipework over 3&quot;nb (DN 75 mm) handling hazardous material would have to be designed by pipework specialists in the design office.
The approach was publicised outside ICI; while the Pipework Code of Practice on its own would have combatted the fault or faults that led to the Flixborough disaster, the adoption more generally of tighter controls on modifications (and the method by which this was done) were soon recognised to be prudent good practice. In the United Kingdom, the ICI approach became a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for high-risk plant (partly because the new (1974) Health and Safety at Work Act went beyond specific requirements on employers to state general duties to keep risks to workers as low as reasonably practicable and to avoid risk to the public so far as reasonably practicable; under this new regime the presumption was that recognised good practice would inherently be &#x27;reasonably practicable&#x27; and hence should be adopted, partly because key passages in reports of the Advisory Committee on Major Hazards were clearly supportive).

==Advisory Committee on Major Hazards==

===Dissatisfaction with existing regulatory regime===
The terms of reference of the Court of Inquiry did not include any requirement to comment on the regulatory regime under which the plant had been built and operated, but it was clear that it was not satisfactory. Construction of the plant had required planning permission approval by the local council; while &quot;an interdepartmental procedure enabled planning authorities to call upon the advice of Her Majesty&#x27;s Factory Inspectorate when considering applications for new developments which might involve a major hazard&quot; (there was no requirement for them to do so), since the council had not recognised the hazardous nature of the plant they had not called for advice. As the &quot;New Scientist&quot; commented within a week of the disaster:

===Terms of Reference and personnel===
The ACMH&#x27;s terms of reference were to identify types of (non-nuclear) installations posing a major hazard, and advise on appropriate controls on their establishment, siting, layout, design, operation, maintenance and development (including overall development in their vicinity). Unlike the Court of Inquiry, its personnel (and that of its associated working groups) had significant representation of safety professionals, drawn largely from the nuclear industry and ICI (or ex-ICI)

===Suggested regulatory framework===
In its first report (issued as a basis for consultation and comment in March 1976), the ACMH noted that hazard could not be quantified in the abstract, and that a precise definition of &#x27;major hazard&#x27; was therefore impossible. Instead installations with an inventory of flammable fluids above a certain threshold or of toxic materials above a certain &#x27;chlorine equivalent&#x27; threshold should be &#x27; &quot;notifiable installations&quot; &#x27;. A company operating a notifiable installation should be required to survey its hazard potential, and inform HSE of the hazards identified and the procedures and methods adopted (or to be adopted) to deal with them.

HSE could then choose to – in some cases (generally involving high risk or novel technology) – require submission of a more elaborate assessment, covering (as appropriate) &quot;design, manufacture, construction, commissioning, operation and maintenance, as well as subsequent modifications whether of the design or operational procedures or both&quot;. The company would have to show that &quot;it possesses the appropriate management system, safety philosophy, and competent people, that it has effective methods of identifying and evaluating hazards, that it has designed and operates the installation in accordance with appropriate regulations, standards and codes of practice, that it has adequate procedures for dealing with emergencies, and that it makes use of independent checks where appropriate&quot;

For most &#x27;notifiable installations&#x27; no further explicit controls should be needed; HSE could advise and if need be enforce improvements under the general powers given it by the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act (HASAWA), but for a very few sites explicit licensing by HSE might be appropriate; responsibility for safety of the installation remaining however always and totally with the licensee.

===Ensuring safety of &#x27;major hazard&#x27; installations===
HASAWA already required companies to have a safety policy, and a comprehensive plan to implement it. ACMH felt that for major hazard installations the plan should be formal and include
*The regulation by company procedures of safety matters (such as: identification of hazards, control of maintenance (through clearance certificates, permits to work etc.), control of modifications which might affect plant integrity, emergency operating procedures, access control)
*Clear safety roles (for e.g. the design and development team, production management, safety officers)
*Training for safety, measures to foster awareness of safety, and feedback of information on safety matters

Safety documents were needed both for design and operation. The management of major hazard installations must show that it possessed and used a selection of appropriate hazard recognition techniques, had a proper system for audit of critical safety features, and used independent assessment where appropriate.

The ACMH also called for tight discipline in the operation of major hazard plants:

The ACMH&#x27;s second report (1979) rejected criticisms that since accidents causing multiple fatalities were associated with extensive and expensive plant damage the operators of major hazard sites had every incentive to avoid such accidents and so it was excessive to require major hazard sites to demonstrate their safety to a government body in such detail:

The approach advocated by the ACMH was largely followed in subsequent UK legislation and regulatory action, but following the release of chlordioxins by a runaway chemical reaction at Seveso in northern Italy in July 1976, &#x27;major hazard plants&#x27; became an EU-wide issue and the UK approach became subsumed in EU-wide initiatives (the Seveso Directive in 1982, superseded by the Seveso II Directive in 1996). A third and final report was issued when the ACMH was disbanded in 1983.

Footage of the incident appeared in the film &quot;Days of Fury&quot; (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price.

<doc id="671112" wikidata="Q1800394" url="?curid=671112" title="Leir of Britain">
<text>Leir was a legendary king of the Britons whose story was recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical 12th-century &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;. According to Geoffrey&#x27;s genealogy of the British dynasty, Leir reigned around the 8th century BC, around the time of the founding of Rome. The story was modified and retold by William Shakespeare in his Jacobean tragedy &quot;King Lear&quot;.

==Name==
Geoffrey of Monmouth identified Leir as the eponymous founder of the city of Leicester (&quot;Ligoraceastre&quot; in Old English; , ), which he called (using the Old Welsh form of the city&#x27;s name) &quot;Kaerleir&quot; (&quot;City of Leir&quot;).

&quot;Leir&quot;, &quot;Lerion&quot;, and &quot;Ligora(ceastre)&quot; all derive from the old Brittonic name of the River Soar, *&quot;Ligera&quot; or *&quot;Ligora&quot;.

==Legend==
===Reign===
Leir&#x27;s story was first recorded in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;. In it, Leir is part of the dynasty of Brutus of Britain and succeeded to the throne after his father Bladud died while attempting to fly with artificial wings. The dating is inexact, but Geoffrey made Bladud a contemporary of the biblical prophet Elijah. Leir was given the longest reign of Geoffrey&#x27;s kings, ruling for 60 years. Geoffrey claimed he was the eponymous founder of Leicester in England.

===Abdication===
Leir was said to have been the end of Brutus of Troy&#x27;s male line of descent, siring three daughters: Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. As he neared his death, he divided his kingdom among them. Goneril and Regan flattered their father and, at the advice of Leir&#x27;s nobles, were married off to the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall, respectively. Cordelia, despite being her father&#x27;s favourite, refused to flatter him, feeling that she should not need to make special assurances of her love, and was given no land to rule. King Aganippus of the Franks courted and married Cordelia, despite Leir&#x27;s refusal to pay a dowry. Leir then gave Goneril and Regan half his kingdom, planning to bequeath them the remainder at his death; instead, his sons-in-law rebelled and seized the whole of it. Duke Maglaurus of Albany, Goneril&#x27;s husband, maintained Leir with a retinue of 60 knights, but his wife reduced this by half after two years. Leir then fled to Regan, who reduced his entourage to only five men. Returning to Albany and pleading with Goneril, Leir was left with a single knight for protection.

===Restoration===
At this point, Leir feared both his elder daughters and fled to France. He sent Cordelia a messenger when he was outside her court at Karitia. She had him bathed, royally clothed, and assigned a fittingly large band of retainers. He was then officially received by the king and made regent of France, with the Frankish nobles vowing to restore him to his former glory. Leir, Cordelia, and her husband invaded Britain and overthrew his other daughters and sons-in-law. Leir ruled three years and then died. Cordelia succeeded him and buried him in an underground shrine to the god Janus beneath the River Soar near Leicester—allegedly the current site of the city&#x27;s Jewry Wall. An annual feast was held nearby in his honour.


==In culture==

Leir&#x27;s life was dramatised on the Elizabethan stage in an anonymous play, &quot;King Leir&quot;, which was registered in 1594 and published in 1605 under the title &quot;The True Chronicle History of King Leir, and his three daughters, Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordella&quot;. This precursor to Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy was a comedy, repeating Geoffrey&#x27;s story and ending happily with Leir&#x27;s restoration to power. The story also appears in John Higgins&#x27;s &quot;Mirror for Magistrates&quot;, Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, and other works.

<doc id="671128" wikidata="Q1133111" url="?curid=671128" title="Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount">
<text>Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount (previously known as Lōʻihi) is an active submarine volcano about off the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii. The top of the seamount is about below sea level. This seamount is on the flank of Mauna Loa, the largest active subaerial shield volcano on Earth. Kamaʻehuakanaloa is the newest volcano in the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain, a string of volcanoes that stretches about northwest of Kamaʻehuakanaloa. Unlike most active volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean that make up the active plate margins on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Kamaʻehuakanaloa and the other volcanoes of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain are hotspot volcanoes and formed well away from the nearest plate boundary. Volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands arise from the Hawaii hotspot, and as the youngest volcano in the chain, Kamaʻehuakanaloa is the only Hawaiian volcano in the deep submarine preshield stage of development.

Kamaʻehuakanaloa began forming around 400,000 years ago and is expected to begin emerging above sea level about 10,000–100,000 years from now. At its summit, Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount stands more than above the seafloor, making it taller than Mount St. Helens was before its catastrophic 1980 eruption. A diverse microbial community resides around Kamaʻehuakanaloa many hydrothermal vents.

In the summer of 1996, a swarm of 4,070 earthquakes was recorded at Kamaʻehuakanaloa. At the time this was the most energetic earthquake swarm in Hawaii recorded history. The swarm altered of the seamount&#x27;s summit; one section, &quot;Pele&#x27;s Vents&quot;, collapsed entirely upon itself and formed the renamed &quot;Pele&#x27;s Pit&quot;. The volcano has remained relatively active since the 1996 swarm and is monitored by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Hawaii Undersea Geological Observatory (HUGO) provided real-time data on Kamaʻehuakanaloa between 1997 and 1998. Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s last known eruption was in 1996, before the earthquake swarm of that summer.

==Naming==
The name Kamaʻehuakanaloa is a Hawaiian language word for &quot;glowing child of Kanaloa&quot;, the god of the ocean. This name was found in two Hawaiian mele from the 19th and early twentieth centuries based on research at the Bishop Museum and was assigned by the Hawaiʻi Board on Geographic Names in 2021 and adopted by the U.S. Geological Survey. From 1955 to 2021 the seamount was called &quot;Lōʻihi&quot;, the Hawaiian word for &quot;long&quot;, describing its shape. The change to Kamaʻehuakanaloa was made in an effort to be more culturally appropriate given native Hawaiian traditions for naming.

==Characteristics==
===Geology===
Kamaʻehuakanaloa is a seamount, or underwater volcano, on the flank of Mauna Loa, the Earth&#x27;s tallest shield volcano. It is the newest volcano produced by the Hawaiʻi hotspot in the extensive Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The distance between the summit of the older Mauna Loa and the summit of Kamaʻehuakanaloa is about , which is, coincidentally, also the approximate diameter of the Hawaiʻi hotspot. Kamaʻehuakanaloa consists of a summit area with three pit craters, a long rift zone extending north from the summit, and a long rift zone extending south-southeast from the summit.

The summit&#x27;s pit craters are named West Pit, East Pit, and Pele&#x27;s Pit. Pele&#x27;s Pit is the youngest of this group and is located at the southern part of the summit. The walls of Pele&#x27;s Pit stand high and were formed in July 1996 when its predecessor, Pele&#x27;s Vent, a hydrothermal field near Kamaʻehuakanaloa summit, collapsed into a large depression. The thick crater walls of Pele&#x27;s Pit – averaging in width, unusually thick for Hawaiian volcanic craters – suggest its craters have filled with lava multiple times in the past.

Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s north–south trending rift zones form a distinctive elongated shape, from which the volcano&#x27;s earlier Hawaiian name &quot;Lōʻihi,&quot; meaning &quot;long&quot;, derives. The north rift zone consists of a longer western portion and a shorter eastern rift zone. Observations show that both the north and south rift zones lack sediment cover, indicating recent activity. A bulge in the western part of the north rift zone contains three cone-shaped prominences.

Until 1970, Kamaʻehuakanaloa was thought to be an inactive volcano that had been transported to its current location by sea-floor spreading. The seafloor under Hawaii is years old and was produced at the East Pacific Rise, an oceanic spreading center where new sea floor forms from magma that erupts from the mantle. New oceanic crust moves away from the spreading center. Over a period of years, the sea floor under Hawaii moved from the East Pacific Rise to its present location west, carrying ancient seamounts with it. When scientists investigated a series of earthquakes off Hawaii in 1970, they discovered that Kamaʻehuakanaloa was an active member of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain.
Kamaʻehuakanaloa is built on the seafloor with a slope of about five degrees. Its northern base on the flank of Mauna Loa is below sea level, but its southern base is a more substantial below the surface. Thus, the summit is above the seafloor as measured from the base of its north flank, but high when measured from the base of its southern flank. Kamaʻehuakanaloa is following the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s lavas indicates that Kamaʻehuakanaloa is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and a lower level of activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually give birth to an island at Kamaʻehuakanaloa. It experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Kamaʻehuakanaloa is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.

===Age and growth===

Radiometric dating was used to determine the age of rock samples from Kamaʻehuakanaloa. The Hawaii Center for Volcanology tested samples recovered by various expeditions, notably the 1978 expedition, which provided 17 dredge samples. Most of the samples were found to be of recent origin; the oldest dated rock is around 300,000 years old. Following the 1996 event, some young breccia was also collected. Based on the samples, scientists estimate Kamaʻehuakanaloa is about 400,000 years old. The rock accumulates at an average rate of per year near the base, and near the summit. If the data model from other volcanoes such as Kīlauea holds true for Kamaʻehuakanaloa, 40% of the volcano&#x27;s mass formed within the last 100,000 years. Assuming a linear growth rate, Kamaʻehuakanaloa is 250,000 years old. However, as with all hotspot volcanoes, Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s level of activity has increased with time; therefore, it would take at least 400,000 years for such a volcano to reach Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s mass. As Hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest at a rate of about a year, Kamaʻehuakanaloa was southeast of its current position at the time of its initial eruption.

==Activity==
Kamaʻehuakanaloa is a young and fairly active volcano, although less active than nearby Kīlauea. In the past few decades, several earthquake swarms have been attributed to Kamaʻehuakanaloa, the largest of which are summarized in the table below. The volcano&#x27;s activity is now known to predate scientific record keeping of its activity, which commenced in 1959. Most earthquake swarms at Kamaʻehuakanaloa have lasted less than two days; the two exceptions are the 1990-1991 earthquake, lasting several months, and the 1996 event, which was shorter but much more pronounced. The 1996 event was directly observed by an ocean bottom seismometer (OBS), allowing scientists to calculate the depth of the earthquakes as to below the summit, approximating to the position of Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s extremely shallow magma chamber. This is evidence that Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s seismicity is volcanic in origin.

The low-level seismic activity documented on Kamaʻehuakanaloa since 1959 has shown that between two and ten earthquakes per month are traceable to the summit. Earthquake swarm data have been used to analyze how well Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s rocks propagate seismic waves and to investigate the relationship between earthquakes and eruptions. This low level activity is periodically punctuated by large swarms of earthquakes, each swarm composed of up to hundreds of earthquakes. The majority of the earthquakes are not distributed close to the summit, though they follow a north–south trend. Rather, most of the earthquakes occur in the southwest portion of Kamaʻehuakanaloa. The largest recorded swarms took place on Kamaʻehuakanaloa in 1971, 1972, 1975, 1991–92 and 1996. The nearest seismic station is around from Kamaʻehuakanaloa, on the south coast of Hawaii. Seismic events that have a magnitude under 2 are recorded often, but their location cannot be determined as precisely as it can for larger events. In fact, HUGO (Hawaii Undersea Geological Observatory), positioned on Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s flank, detected ten times as many earthquakes as were recorded by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) seismic network.

===1996 earthquake swarm===
The largest amount of activity recorded for the Kamaʻehuakanaloa seamount was a swarm of 4,070 earthquakes between July 16 and August 9, 1996. This series of earthquakes was the largest recorded for any Hawaiian volcano to date in both amount and intensity. Most of the earthquakes had moment magnitudes of less than 3.0. &quot;Several hundred&quot; had a magnitude greater than 3.0, including more than 40 greater than 4.0 and a 5.0 tremor.

The final two weeks of the earthquake swarm were observed by a rapid response cruise launched in August 1996. The National Science Foundation funded an expedition by University of Hawaiʻi scientists, led by Frederick Duennebier, that began investigating the swarm and its origin in August 1996. The scientists&#x27; assessment laid the groundwork for many of the expeditions that followed. Follow-up expeditions to Kamaʻehuakanaloa took place, including a series of crewed submersible dives in August and September. These were supplemented by a great deal of shore-based research. Fresh rock collected during the expedition revealed that an eruption occurred &quot;before&quot; the earthquake swarm.

Submersible dives in August were followed by NOAA-funded research in September and October 1996. These more detailed studies showed the southern portion of Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s summit had collapsed, a result of a swarm of earthquakes and the rapid withdrawal of magma from the volcano. A crater across and deep formed out of the rubble. The event involved the movement of cubic meters of volcanic material. A region of of the summit was altered and populated by bus-sized pillow lava blocks, precariously perched along the outer rim of the newly formed crater. &quot;Pele&#x27;s Vents&quot;, an area on the southern side, previously considered stable, collapsed completely into a giant pit, renamed &quot;Pele&#x27;s Pit&quot;. Strong currents make submersible diving hazardous in the region.

The researchers were continually met by clouds of sulfide and sulfate. The sudden collapse of Pele&#x27;s Vents caused a large discharge of hydrothermal material. The presence of certain indicator minerals in the mixture suggested temperatures exceeded , a record for an underwater volcano. The composition of the materials was similar to that of black smokers, the hydrothermal vent plumes located along mid-ocean ridges. Samples from mounds built by discharges from the hydrothermal plumes resembled white smokers.

The studies demonstrated that the most volcanically and hydrothermally active area was along the southern rift. Dives on the less active northern rim indicated that the terrain was more stable there, and high lava columns were still standing upright. A new hydrothermal vent field (Naha Vents) was located in the upper-south rift zone, at a depth of .

===Recent activity===
Kamaʻehuakanaloa has remained largely quiet since the 1996 event; no activity was recorded from 2002 to 2004. The seamount showed signs of unrest again in 2005 by generating an earthquake bigger than any previously recorded there. USGS-ANSS (Advanced National Seismic System) reported two earthquakes, magnitudes 5.1 and 5.4, on May 13 and July 17. Both originated from a depth of . On April 23, a magnitude 4.3 earthquake was recorded at a depth of approximately . Between December 7, 2005, and January 18, 2006, a swarm of around 100 earthquakes occurred, the largest measuring 4 on the Moment magnitude scale and deep. Another earthquake measuring 4.7 was later recorded approximately midway between Kamaʻehuakanaloa and Pāhala (on the south coast of the island of Hawaii).

==Exploration==
===Early work===

Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount&#x27;s first depiction on a map was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric rendering of part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. Macdonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald&#x27;s hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) and there was no volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.
Geologists suspected the seamount could be an active undersea volcano, but without evidence the idea remained speculative. The volcano was largely ignored after the 1952 event, and was often mislabeled as an &quot;older volcanic feature&quot; in subsequent charts. Geologist Kenneth O. Emery is credited with naming the seamount in 1955, describing the long and narrow shape of the volcano as &quot;Kamaʻehuakanaloa&quot;. In 1978, an expedition studied intense, repeated seismic activity known as earthquake swarms in and around the Kamaʻehuakanaloa area. Rather than finding an old, extinct seamount, data collected revealed Kamaʻehuakanaloa to be a young, possibly active volcano. Observations showed the volcano to be encrusted with young and old lava flows. Fluids erupting from active hydrothermal vents were also found.

In 1978, a US Geological Survey research ship collected dredge samples and photographed Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s summit with the goal of studying whether Kamaʻehuakanaloa is active. Analysis of the photos and testing of pillow lava rock samples appeared to show that the material was &quot;fresh&quot;, yielding more evidence that Kamaʻehuakanaloa is still active. An expedition from October 1980 to January 1981 collected further dredge samples and photographs, providing additional confirmation. Studies indicated that the eruptions came from the southern part of the rift crater. This area is closest to the Hawaiʻi hotspot, which supplies Kamaʻehuakanaloa with magma. Following a 1986 seismic event, a network of five ocean bottom observatories (OBOs) were deployed on Kamaʻehuakanaloa for a month. Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s frequent seismicity makes it an ideal candidate for seismic study through OBOs. In 1987, the submersible DSV Alvin was used to survey Kamaʻehuakanaloa
Another autonomous observatory was positioned on Kamaʻehuakanaloa in 1991 to track earthquake swarms.

===1996 to present===
The bulk of information about Kamaʻehuakanaloa comes from dives made in response to the 1996 eruption. In a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported, visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water. The bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at Pele&#x27;s Pit (formed from the collapse of the old ones), and may be indicators of the kinds of material ejected from the newly formed vents. They were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory. An OBO briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed.

Repeated multibeam bathymetric mapping was used to measure the changes in the summit following the 1996 collapse. Hydrothermal plume surveys confirmed changes in the energy, and dissolved minerals emanating from Kamaʻehuakanaloa. Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory, HURL&#x27;s submersible &quot;Pisces V&quot; allowed scientists to sample the vent waters, microorganisms and hydrothermal mineral deposits.

Since 2006, the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory (FeMO), funded by the National Science Foundation and Microbial Observatory Program, has led cruises to Kamaʻehuakanaloa investigate its microbiology every October. The first cruise, on the ship &quot;R/V Melville&quot; and exploiting the submersible &quot;JASON2&quot;, lasted from September 22 to October 9. These cruises study the large number of Fe-oxidizing bacteria that have colonized Kamaʻehuakanaloa. Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s extensive vent system is characterized by a high concentration of CO2 and iron, while being low in sulfide. These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria, called FeOB, to thrive in.

===HUGO (Hawaii Undersea Geological Observatory)===
In 1997, scientists from the University of Hawaiʻi installed an ocean bottom observatory on the summit of Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount. The submarine observatory was nicknamed HUGO (Hawaiʻi Undersea Geological Observatory). HUGO was connected to the shore, away, by a fiber optic cable. It was designed to give scientists real-time seismic, chemical and visual data about the state of Kamaʻehuakanaloa, which had by then become an international laboratory for the study of undersea volcanism. The cable that provided HUGO with power and communications broke in April 1998, effectively shutting it down. The observatory was recovered from the seafloor in 2002.

==Ecology==
===Hydrothermal vent geochemistry===

Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s mid-Pacific location and its well-sustained hydrothermal system contribute to a rich oasis for a microbial ecosystem. Areas of extensive hydrothermal venting are found on Kamaʻehuakanaloa&#x27;s crater floor and north slope, and along the summit of Kamaʻehuakanaloa itself. Active hydrothermal vents were first discovered at Kamaʻehuakanaloa in the late 1980s. These vents are remarkably similar to those found at the mid-ocean ridges, with similar composition and thermal differences. The two most prominent vent fields are at the summit: &quot;Pele&#x27;s Pit&quot; (formally &quot;Pele&#x27;s Vents&quot;) and &quot;Kapo&#x27;s Vents&quot;. They are named after the Hawaiian deity Pele and her sister Kapo. These vents were considered &quot;low temperature vents&quot; because their waters were only about . The volcanic eruption of 1996 and the creation of Pele&#x27;s Pit changed this, and initiated high temperature venting; exit temperatures were measured at in 1996.

===Microorganisms===
The vents lie below the surface, and range in temperature from 10 to over . The vent fluids are characterized by a high concentration of (up to 17 mM) and Fe (Iron), but low in sulfide. Low oxygen and pH levels are important factors in supporting the high amounts of Fe (iron), one of the hallmark features of Kamaʻehuakanaloa. These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria, called FeOB, to thrive in. An example of these species is &quot;Mariprofundus ferrooxydans&quot;, sole member of the class Zetaproteobacteria. The composition of the materials was similar to that of black smokers, that are a habitat of archaea extremophiles. Dissolution and oxidation of the mineral observed over the next two years suggests the sulfate is not easily preserved.

A diverse community of microbial mats surround the vents and virtually cover Pele&#x27;s Pit.
The Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory (HURL), NOAA&#x27;s Research Center for Hawaiʻi and the Western Pacific, monitors and researches the hydrothermal systems and studies the local community.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded an extremophile sampling expedition to Kamaʻehuakanaloa in 1999. Microbial mats surrounded the vents, and included a novel jelly-like organism. Samples were collected for study at NSF&#x27;s Marine Bioproducts Engineering Center (MarBEC). In 2001, &quot;Pisces V&quot; collected samples of the organisms and brought them to the surface for study.

NOAA&#x27;s National Undersea Research Center and NSF&#x27;s Marine Bioproducts Engineering Center are cooperating to sample and research the local bacteria and archaea extremophiles. The fourth FeMO (Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory) cruise occurred during October 2009.

===Macroorganisms===
Marine life inhabiting the waters around Kamaʻehuakanaloa is not as diverse as life at other, less active seamounts. Fish found living near Kamaʻehuakanaloa include the Celebes monkfish (&quot;Sladenia remiger&quot;), and members of the cutthroat eel family, Synaphobranchidae. Invertebrates identified in the area include two species endemic to the hydrothermal vents, a bresiliid shrimp (&quot;Opaepele loihi&quot;) of the family Alvinocarididae (described in 1995), and a tube or pogonophoran worm. Dives conducted after the 1996 earthquake swarms were unable to find either the shrimp or the worm, and it is not known if there are lasting effects on these species.

From 1982 to 1992, researchers in Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory submersibles photographed the fish of Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount, Johnston Atoll, and Cross Seamount at depths between . A small number of species identified at Kamaʻehuakanaloa were newly recorded sightings in Hawaiʻi, including the tasseled coffinfish (&quot;Chaunax fimbriatus&quot;), and the Celebes monkfish.

<text>A screamer is a circus march intended to stir up the audience during the show.

== History ==
Screamers were mostly composed in a 60-year period (1895–1955). Circuses were in need of music that would stir the audience into a frenzy, as four-footed animals galloped across the ring. Because march music was a prominent part of American music at that time, and because it carried such a quick tempo, it was this that ringmasters demanded.

== Musicality ==

Circus marches are faster than a normal military march, often 130 to 150 beats/minute. Although screamers tend to follow the march form, they are often abbreviated, and additions, such as a quick cornet call introduction to a new melody, are included. A typical screamer lasts a minute to three and a half minutes.

Screamers are a very demanding type of music, due to their extremely fast and advanced rhythms, especially the low-brass parts. Double and even triple tonguing is often required in order to play these rhythms. The trio in &quot;The Melody Shop&quot; is a good example of this. Many screamers have two prominent melodies playing at once. Although this is not unusual in a march, screamers tend to go further with this. The low-brass section can be playing a long, stately melody, while the woodwinds can be moving along with a phrase of 16th notes, or vice versa. Due to the circumstances in which screamers are played, dynamics tend to stay at a level forte. Unlike some military marches, &quot;piano&quot; is rarely used.

== Composers ==
Composers of screamers included Karl L. King, whose work included &quot;Barnum &amp; Bailey&#x27;s Favorite&quot;, Fred Jewell and Henry Fillmore. John Philip Sousa wrote &quot;On Parade&quot; and a few others, but his writing in the circus march style is not highly regarded.

<text>The Victoria Cougars were a major league professional ice hockey team that played in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) from 1911 to 1924 under various names, and (after the PCHA&#x27;s merger with the Western Canada Hockey League) in the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1924 to 1926. The team was based in Victoria, British Columbia, and won the Stanley Cup in 1925, becoming the final non-NHL team to win the Cup.

== History ==
The original Victoria franchise of the PCHA, the Victoria Senators, were formed in 1911, and became the Victoria Aristocrats in 1915. The Aristocrats challenged the Toronto Blueshirts for the Stanley Cup the following year, but lost. In 1916 the team was forced to move to Spokane, Washington, after having their arena (Patrick Arena) commandeered by the Canadian military. The club folded the following year as the Spokane Canaries.

A new team was formed in 1918 and again were dubbed the Victoria Aristocrats, with players from the folded Portland Rosebuds. In 1922 they changed their name to the Victoria Cougars. Led by coach Lester Patrick, the Cougars would win the Stanley Cup in 1925 against the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Cougars were the last non-NHL team to hoist the Stanley Cup as well as the last west coast team to win it until the Anaheim Ducks did so in 2007. They would attempt to repeat as champions in 1926 but they were unsuccessful as they lost the final series to the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Maroons. 

The WHL dissolved after the season. That spring, a group of businessmen from Detroit won an NHL expansion franchise and bought the rights to many of the players from the Stanley Cup finalist Cougars. The new NHL franchise would retain the nickname &quot;Cougars&quot; in tribute. The Detroit Cougars would later be renamed the Detroit Falcons, and would ultimately be renamed the Detroit Red Wings.

Among the notable players who played for the Cougars were Hall of Famers Hec Fowler (goaltender), Frank Foyston, Frank Fredrickson, Hap Holmes (goaltender), Clem Loughlin, Harry Meeking and Jack Walker.

<doc id="671145" wikidata="Q2451581" url="?curid=671145" title="Cordelia of Britain">
<text>Cordelia (or Cordeilla) was a legendary Queen of the Britons, as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. She came to power in 855BC.

She was the youngest daughter of Leir and the second ruling queen of pre-Roman Britain. There is no independent historical evidence for her existence. She is traditionally identified with the minor character Creiddylad from Welsh tradition, but this identification has been doubted by scholars.

==Legend==

Cordelia was Leir&#x27;s favourite daughter, being the younger sister to Goneril and Regan. When Leir decided to divide his kingdom among his daughters and their husbands, Cordelia refused to flatter him. In response, Leir refused her any land in Britain or the blessing of any husband. Regardless, Aganippus, the king of the Franks, courted her, and Leir granted the marriage but denied him any dowry. She moved to the royal court at Karitia in Gaul and lived there for many years.

Leir became exiled from Britain and fled to Cordelia in Gaul, seeking a restoration of his throne which had been seized by the husbands of his other daughters. She raised an army and invaded Britain, defeating the ruling dukes and restoring Leir. After Leir&#x27;s death three years later, Cordelia&#x27;s husband Aganippus died, and she returned to Britain and was crowned queen.

Cordelia ruled peacefully for five years until her sisters&#x27; sons, Cunedagius and Marganus, came of age. As the dukes of Cornwall and Albany, respectively, they despised the rule of a woman when they claimed proper descent to rule. They raised armies and fought against Cordelia, who fought in person at numerous battles. She was captured and imprisoned by her nephews. In her grief, she committed suicide. Cunedagius succeeded her in the kingship of Britain in the lands southwest of the Humber. Marganus ruled the region northeast of the Humber. Civil war broke out between them soon after, with Marganus&#x27; being defeated and killed.
==In culture==
The story was used by Shakespeare in his play &quot;King Lear&quot;. In Shakespeare&#x27;s version, Cordelia&#x27;s invasion of Britain is unsuccessful; she is captured and murdered, and her father does not retake the throne. 

Before Shakespeare, the story was also used in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; and in the anonymous play &quot;King Leir&quot;. The popularity of Cordelia at this period is probably because her role as a heroic queen was comparable to Queen Elizabeth I.

<text>Ibrahim Ferrer (20 February 1927 – 6 August 2005) was a Cuban singer who played with the group Los Bocucos for nearly forty years. He also performed with Conjunto Sorpresa, Chepín y su Orquesta Oriental, and Mario Patterson. After his retirement in 1991, he was brought back in the studio to record with the Afro-Cuban All Stars and Buena Vista Social Club, in March 1996. He then toured internationally with these revival groups and recorded several solo albums for World Circuit, before his death in 2005.

==Early life==
Ferrer was born at a dance club in San Luis, near the city of Santiago de Cuba. His mother died when he was twelve, leaving him orphaned and forcing him to sing on the streets to earn money.

The following year, Ferrer joined his first musical group—a duet with his cousin—called Jovenes del Son. They performed at private functions, and the two youths managed to scrape together enough money to live.

==Career==
Over the next few years, Ferrer would perform with many musical groups, including Conjunto Sorpresa and Chepín y su Orquesta Oriental. As lead singer of the latter, Ferrer recorded in 1956 his biggest hit, &quot;El platanal de Bartolo&quot;. In 1961, he also sang lead for Mario Patterson y su Orquesta Oriental on &quot;Cariño falso&quot;, a standard of the guaracha repertoire.

===Los Bocucos===
In 1953, Ferrer began performing with Pacho Alonso&#x27;s group in Santiago, Cuba. In 1959, the group moved permanently to Havana, renaming themselves Los Bocucos, after a type of drum widely used in Santiago, the &quot;bocú&quot;. With Alonso, Ferrer primarily performed sones, guarachas, and other up-tempo songs. However, his goal was to sing boleros.

Ferrer remained a member of Los Bocucos until his retirement in 1991. Starting in 1967, Los Bocucos became an independent group, since Pacho Alonso started a new band, Los Pachucos. Since then, Ferrer began to sing lead more often, instead of performing as a backing singer. The group released several albums in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1998, Cuban label EGREM released &quot;Tierra caliente&quot;, a compilation of tracks recorded by Los Bocucos between 1970 and 1988, featuring Ferrer as lead singer. The songs were directed and arranged by Roberto Correra, the group&#x27;s lead trumpeter.

===Career revival===
In 1996, Ferrer took part in Nick Gold&#x27;s World Circuit sessions when it was announced that an old-style bolero singer would be required. He first participated in the recording of the album &quot;A Toda Cuba le Gusta&quot; with the Afro-Cuban All Stars, which was nominated for a Grammy Award. This project was immediately followed by the recording of Ry Cooder&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; album, which showcased Ferrer&#x27;s talent as a bolero singer and made him widely known outside Cuba.

In 1999, Cooder recorded Ferrer&#x27;s first solo album. In 2000, Ferrer, at the age of 72, received a Latin Grammy for Best New Artist.

In 2001, he appeared on the track &quot;Latin Simone (¿Qué Pasa Contigo?)&quot; on the self-titled debut album of virtual band Gorillaz. Following Ferrer&#x27;s death, Gorillaz played the song live as a tribute to him at concerts in 2005 and 2006, and again in 2018.

In 2004, Ferrer won a Grammy but was denied permission by the US government to enter the country to receive his award as a result of extremely restrictive visa laws enacted in the wake of 9/11.

Ferrer released his second solo recording, &quot;Buenos Hermanos&quot;, in 2003 and continued touring in Europe into 2005. He contributed in 2005 to the APE Vision Artists Project Earth album &quot;Rhythms Del Mundo&quot;: Cuba, a collaboration with Coldplay, U2, Sting, Dido, Faithless, Jack Johnson, Maroon 5, and others. Ferrer&#x27;s last recording was &quot;Mi sueño&quot;, an album devoted to the bolero. It was released posthumously in 2006.

The singer was posthumously featured in the Gorillaz documentary films &quot;Bananaz&quot; and &quot;Reject False Icons&quot; in 2008 and 2019, respectively.

==Personal life==
Ferrer was an adherent of the Santería faith, a blending of the traditional Nigerian Yoruba religion and Catholicism.

==Death==
Ibrahim Ferrer died at age 78 of multiple organ failure on 6 August 2005, at CIMEQ hospital in Havana, after returning from a European tour. He was buried at the Colón Cemetery.

<doc id="671149" wikidata="Q630991" url="?curid=671149" title="Charlotte Knights">
<text>The Charlotte Knights are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. They are located in Charlotte, North Carolina, and play their home games at Truist Field, which opened in 2014 and is located in Uptown Charlotte. The team previously played at Knights Park (1976–1988), Knights Castle (1989), and Knights Stadium (1990–2013).

Established as a Double-A franchise of the Southern League in 1976, the team was known as the Charlotte Orioles, or Charlotte O&#x27;s, through 1987. The O&#x27;s won the Southern League championship twice: in 1980 and 1984 as the Double-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. They were rebranded as the Knights in 1988.

The Knights were replaced by a Triple-A International League team in 1993 in conjunction with the expansion of Major League Baseball (MLB). The Triple-A Knights carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded them. In conjunction with MLB&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Knights were shifted to the Triple-A East, but this was renamed the International League in 2022. The Knights have won two International League championships: in 1993 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians and again in 1999 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox.

== History==
=== Prior professional baseball in Charlotte===

The first professional baseball team in Charlotte was the Charlotte Hornets, who played only a single season. In 1900, the city was home to the Charlotte Presbyterians. A year later, a new Hornets team formed. The Hornets competed in various leagues for 66 seasons through 1972. In 1937, the Washington Senators, later the Minnesota Twins, purchased the team. The Hornets remained a minor league affiliate of the Senators/Twins for 35 years. In 1940, Calvin Griffith, the son of Senators owner Clark Griffith and future owner of the Senators/Twins, built an approximately 5,000-seat park in Charlotte&#x27;s Dilworth neighborhood, Clark Griffith Park. It would be the home of Charlotte baseball for the next half-century.

The Hornets spent most of the first half of the 20th century in the low minors (in some years, as low as Class D–equivalent to a Rookie-level team today). However, for much of that time they were the Senators&#x27; second-highest affiliate. The Hornets joined the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) in 1954. They had previously been members of the SAL in the 1920s. The league became a Double-A circuit in 1963, and was reorganized as the Southern League in 1964. In 1972, Charlotte was home to two teams: the Hornets and Minnesota&#x27;s Class A affiliate in the Western Carolinas League, the Charlotte Twins. After a lackluster season, however, the Twins were moved to Orlando, Florida, as the Orlando Twins. The Hornets also disbanded after the 1972 season, leaving the city without professional baseball.

=== Southern League (1976–1992) ===

In 1976, professional wrestling promoter Jim Crockett Jr. and his family bought the Asheville Orioles, the Double-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles, and relocated the club from Asheville, North Carolina, to Charlotte as the Charlotte Orioles. Crockett renovated Griffith Park and renamed it Jim Crockett Memorial Park. Popularly known as the O&#x27;s, the club joined the Southern League and inherited the Asheville team&#x27;s status as the Orioles&#x27; Double-A affiliate. 

The Southern League used a split-season schedule wherein the division winners from each half qualified for the postseason championship playoffs. Charlotte won the First Half Eastern Division title in their inaugural 1976 season, but they lost the Eastern Division title versus the Orlando Twins in a one-game playoff. The team featured pitcher Dave Ford, who won the Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award, and future Baseball Hall of Famer Eddie Murray at first base. Charlotte won another first half title in 1979 but were again eliminated in the Eastern Division series by the Columbus Astros, 2–0.

Manager Jimmy Williams led the 1980 O&#x27;s to end the season with an even 72–72 record and the first half title. They then swept the Savannah Braves in a three-game series for the Eastern Division title and defeated the Memphis Chicks, 3–1, to win their first Southern League championship. The 1980 team included future Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. at third base. The Orioles returned to the postseason four years later when managers Grady Little and John Hart led them to a 75–72 record and the second half title. They defeated the Greenville Braves, 3–1, for the Eastern Division title before winning their second league championship over the Knoxville Blue Jays, 3–0. Ken Dixon was selected as the league&#x27;s Most Outstanding Pitcher.

In March 1985, the mostly wood-framed Crockett Park was destroyed by fire. An investigation revealed arson as the cause. The Crockett family built a 3,000-seat makeshift stadium immediately afterward, which served as the O&#x27;s home for two years. However, unlike its predecessor, it was completely exposed to the elements, causing a steep decline in attendance. The 1985 O&#x27;s won a second half title and the Eastern Division over Columbus, 3–1, but lost the Southern League title to the Huntsville Stars, 3–2. Similarly, the 1987 first-half champion O&#x27;s won the division title versus the Jacksonville Expos, 3–2, but lost the league crown to the Birmingham Barons, 3–1. Third baseman Tom Dodd was selected for the 1987 Southern League Most Valuable Player Award.

Following the 1987 season, George Shinn, founder of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Charlotte Hornets, bought the team from the Crockett family and committed to building a permanent ballpark. In 1988, the team was renamed the Charlotte Knights in a naming contest, and Crockett Park was renamed Knights Park. The team&#x27;s 13-year affiliation with Baltimore ended after the 1988 season.

In 1989, Shinn moved the Knights to Knights Castle, a temporary 8,000-seat stadium located just over the state line in Fort Mill, South Carolina, near the construction site of their permanent home, Knights Stadium. The stadium was built solely for the 1989 season and was demolished following the final game that year to make room for the completion of the 10,000-seat Knights Stadium. Along with a new ballpark, the Knights also had a new major league affiliate in the Chicago Cubs. Laddie Renfroe won the 1989 Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. Charlotte returned to the playoffs in 1992, but they lost the Eastern Division title to Greenville, who had won both halves of the season.

=== International League (1993–2020) ===

In conjunction with the 1993 Major League Baseball expansion, team owner George Shinn was granted an expansion franchise in the Triple-A International League (IL), which would begin playing in Charlotte in 1993. Shinn, who had applied for Charlotte to receive one of two available Triple-A expansion teams, was recommended by the expansion committee after their visit to evaluate the city. Of the nine applicant cities, Charlotte had the newest stadium, the only major league sports franchise (Shinn&#x27;s Charlotte Hornets), and the largest metro area population. It would be the first time that a Carolinas-based team would play at the highest level of minor league baseball.

Gaining a Triple-A team meant Shinn would need to relocate, or sell, his existing Southern League team as the higher classification team held the rights to the territory. He solicited offers to purchase the club to help defray a US$5 million International League enfranchisement cost. Shinn initially sold the Double-A franchise to Tom Benson, owner of the National Football League&#x27;s New Orleans Saints, who sought to relocate the club to New Orleans, but the move was blocked when Minor League Baseball granted territorial rights to the higher-classification Triple-A Denver Zephyrs, who wanted to move to New Orleans after being uprooted by the Colorado Rockies National League expansion team. Benson eventually opted out of the purchase. Without a ballpark for the 1994 season, Larry Schmittou, president and owner of the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, offered Herschel Greer Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee, as a temporary ballpark for the displaced team until Shinn could find a permanent location. So, the team relocated there in 1993 as the Nashville Xpress.

The Triple-A Charlotte Knights carried on the history and identity of the preceding Double-A team and became the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. In 1993, Charlie Manuel managed the Knights to win the Western Division title with an 86–55 record. They then defeated the Richmond Braves, 3–1, in the semifinals to advance to the Governors&#x27; Cup finals for the International League championship. In the best-of-five series, Charlotte won their first IL championship over the Rochester Red Wings, 3–2. Third baseman Jim Thome, who was later inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame, won the 1993 International League Most Valuable Player Award with the Knights. The 1994 squad made a push for a second IL title, but lost the semifinals versus Richmond, 3–1. Much of the core of the 1993–94 Knights, including Manuel, would help lead the Indians to the World Series in 1995 and 1997.

In 1995, the Knights switched their affiliation to the Florida Marlins. Over four years with Florida, Charlotte&#x27;s only postseason appearance occurred in 1997. As in their previous playoff run, they were eliminated in the semifinals by the Columbus Clippers, 3–1. In 1996, left fielder Billy McMillon was selected as the IL Rookie of the Year.

Before the 1997 season, Shinn sold the Knights to North Carolina businessman Don Beaver, who negotiated a Triple-A affiliation with the Chicago White Sox, which began in 1999. Manager Tom Spencer led the Knights to win the IL Wild Card that season with an 82–62 record. They defeated the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, 3–2, in the semifinals before winning their second IL championship against the Durham Bulls, 3–1. This win earned the team a spot in the Triple-A World Series, a postseason interleague championship series between the league champions of the IL and the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Charlotte lost the Triple-A World Series versus the Vancouver Canadians, 3–2. Spencer was recognized as the IL Manager of the Year.

Jon Garland, later of the 2005 World Series champion White Sox, won the IL Most Valuable Pitcher Award in 2000 with the Knights. In 2003, second baseman Aaron Miles was the Rookie of the Year. Charlotte next qualified for the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs in 2006 having won the Southern Division title, but they lost the semifinals to the Toledo Mud Hens, 3–1. Despite the early postseason exit, a pair of Knights were selected for IL awards. Heath Phillips was the Most Valuable Pitcher, and third baseman Josh Fields was the Rookie of the Year. The club&#x27;s next playoff appearance came in 2012 after winning another Southern Division title. The defeated the Indianapolis Indians, 3–1, to reach the finals but were swept out of the championship round by the Pawtucket Red Sox in three games.

The Knights&#x27; attendance sagged after the turn of the millennium, in part because Knights Stadium was almost half an hour south of Charlotte. Many fans were unwilling to brave Interstate 77&#x27;s infamous congestion in order to go to the stadium. In 2011, the Charlotte City Council and Mecklenburg County Commission approved a land-swap agreement which opened the door for the construction of a new 10,200-seat stadium in downtown Charlotte. The $54 million park, BB&amp;T Ballpark, now Truist Field, opened in time for the 2014 season. It is located one block from Bank of America Stadium, home of the Carolina Panthers. To go along with the move, the Knights dropped the navy blue and dark green color scheme they had been using for the previous 15 years in favor of a new black-gold-silver palette, modeled on the color scheme of the White Sox. They also adopted new logos that focused more on the knight rather than his horse.

Charlotte hosted the 2016 Triple-A All-Star Game in which a team of International League All-Stars defeated the Pacific Coast League All-Stars, 4–2. The Knights narrowly missed the 2016 playoffs, finishing a half game behind the first-place Gwinnett Stripers. The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled on June 30.

=== Triple-A East / International League (2021–present) ===
Following the 2020 season, Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. The Chicago White Sox retained Charlotte as their Triple-A affiliate, but the International League disbanded, and the Knights followed the other IL teams into the Triple-A East. Charlotte ended the season in seventh place in the Southeastern Division with a 45–75 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Charlotte finished the tournament in 26th place with a 2–6 record. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

Prior to the 2023 season, the Knights debuted redesigned logos and uniforms. They retained their gold, silver, and black colors with the addition of blue, which is used by the city&#x27;s other teams, the Carolina Panthers, Charlotte FC, and Charlotte Hornets. The knight&#x27;s helmet was redesigned, as was the &quot;C&quot; featured in their cap logo.

<doc id="671150" wikidata="Q3176278" url="?curid=671150" title="Ignacio Bonillas">
<text>Ignacio Bonillas Fraijo (1 February 1858 – 23 June 1942) was a Mexican diplomat. He was a Mexican ambassador to the United States and held a degree in mine engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was tapped by President Venustiano Carranza as his successor in the 1920 presidential elections, but the revolt of three Sonoran revolutionary generals overthrew Carranza before those elections took place.

==Biography==
He was born on February 1, 1858 in Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, the son of Gervasio Bonillas and Dolores Fraijo. His family moved across the border to the United States to Tucson, Arizona, where he completed his primary studies. He received his degree in civil engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1882. Shortly before finishing his degree, he married a woman originally from Boston. Shortly after getting married he returned to Sonora, where the State Government commissioned him along with engineer Charles Herbert to make the outline of the future town of Nogales, in 1884.

Bonillas began to provide services to the state of Sonora in 1890. Bonillas had to make the measurement of the legal estate of Santa Anna and in the same year, he left leading a group of volunteers and defeated in the mountains a party of Apaches who were marauding the area. On 19 March 1900 the state legislature waived the examination so that he could exercise his profession as an engineer, and the Executive issued the corresponding diploma. Bonillas was &quot;long connected with Sonora&#x27;s mining and contracting companies, trusted by the U.S.-based Southern Pacific Railway.&quot;

In 1910 he joined the Anti-reelectionist Party of Francisco I. Madero and shortly after Madero&#x27;s election following the overthrow of Porfirio Díaz Bonillas was elected Deputy (1911-1913). He was a mining agent in Magdalena, municipal president of Nogales and prefect of the Magdalena District. He was Secretary of Communications in 1912 and did important infrastructure works during the permanence of the constitutionalist government in Veracruz. Following the overthrow of Madero by general Victoriano Huerta, Bonillas joined the Constitutionalist movement headed by Venustiano Carranza. In 1913, Bonillas was part of the war cabinet of the Constitutionalist movement. Carranza&#x27;s Constitutionalist faction defeated its rivals in 1915 and Carranza became president. On 12 February 1917, Carranza appointed Bonillas Mexican Ambassador to the U.S., the top position for a Mexican diplomat. Bonillas was part of the three member diplomatic delegation responsible of securing the unconditional withdrawal of the U.S. forces of the Punitive Expedition from Mexico that had unsuccessfully sought to capture Pancho Villa following his incursion into Columbus, New Mexico. 
Venustiano Carranza, a civilian himself, wanted a civilian instead of a military man to be president of Mexico. Carranza supported the candidacy of Bonillas in the election of 1920, believing that Bonillas&#x27;s connections in Washington were of supreme importance, even though he was not very well known in Mexico. On 1 November 1919, Carranza announced his support for Bonillas&#x27;s candidacy. For Sonoran revolutionary generals Adolfo de la Huerta, Alvaro Obregón, and Plutarco Elías Calles, the unknown civilian Bonillas was an unacceptable successor to the presidency, and they staged a revolt under the Plan of Agua Prieta. Carranza, his cabinet, the Supreme Court, and Bonillas fled by train from Mexico City in May 1920. The train was intercepted by rebels. Carranza was murdered, and Bonillas was captured.

Bonillas died on 23 June 1942 in the United States.

<text>The Durham Bulls are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays. They are located in Durham, North Carolina, and play their home games at Durham Bulls Athletic Park, which opened in 1995.

Established as the Durham Tobacconists in the North Carolina League in 1902, the team subsequently disbanded and restarted numerous times. After a 10-year hiatus, it was reestablished as the Durham Bulls and played in the North Carolina State League from 1913 to 1917. The Bulls were members of the Piedmont League from 1920 to 1933 and for a second time from 1936 to 1943. Durham competed in the Carolina League from 1945 to 1971. For the latter part of this stretch, they merged with a team from Raleigh, becoming the Raleigh-Durham Mets (1968), Raleigh-Durham Phillies (1969), and Raleigh-Durham Triangles (1970–1971). The Durham Bulls returned as members of the Carolina League in 1980. They were replaced by an International League team in 1998. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) reorganization of the minors in 2021, they were placed in the Triple-A East, but this was renamed the International League in 2022.

Durham has won 17 league championships. They won the Piedmont League championship six times (1922, 1924, 1925, 1930, 1940, and 1941). Though not affiliated with any MLB team for the first four, the Bulls were a farm club for the Cincinnati Reds and Brooklyn Dodgers, respectively, for the last two. They won the Carolina League championship on three occasions: in 1957 with the Detroit Tigers, 1967 with the New York Mets, and 1969 with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Bulls have won the International League championship eight times (2002, 2003, 2009, 2013, 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022), all as an affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays. Durham has gone on to win three Triple-A National Championship Games (2009, 2017, and 2022).

The 1988 film &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, starring Kevin Costner, Tim Robbins, and Susan Sarandon, featured the Bulls and Durham Athletic Park, the team&#x27;s stadium at the time. Most of the filming was done at the ballpark following the end of the 1987 season.

===Early years (1902–1926)===
The Bulls were founded in 1902 as the Durham Tobacconists. The official date when the franchise formed was March 18. William G. Bramham, later President of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (Minor League Baseball), was the first owner. The Tobacconists took the field for the first time on April 24 in an exhibition game against Trinity College. Their first game in the North Carolina League was at Charlotte on May 5 against the Hornets, and their first home game was against the New Bern Truckers on May 12. The league, however, folded in July, not having played a full season.

In December 1912, the Durham Tobacconists re-formed as the Durham Bulls in the North Carolina State League. Their first game was on April 24, 1913, at Hanes Field on the Trinity College campus (now the East Campus of Duke University). They defeated the Raleigh Capitals 7-4. On May 30, 1917, however, the North Carolina State League folded due to America&#x27;s joining of the Allied Powers during World War I. The Bulls were declared league champions, even though the season was shortened to only 36 games.

On October 31, 1919, the Bulls joined the Piedmont League, a minor league with clubs scattered around Virginia and North Carolina. Seven years later, in 1926, the team moved from Hanes Field to El Toro Park. The park was dedicated on July 26 by the Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who put on a show by riding a real bull, the team mascot, onto the playing field.

===Durham Athletic Park and the Carolina League (1932–1957)===
Six years later, in 1932, the team became affiliated with the National League&#x27;s Philadelphia Phillies, the first of ten teams that the Bulls have been affiliated with. The next year, the city of Durham purchased El Toro Park, renaming it the Durham Athletic Park after the 1933 season. The Bulls were unable to operate for the 1934 and 1935 seasons due to the Great Depression. Meanwhile, a team from Wilmington, North Carolina who also played in the Piedmont League and was a Cincinnati Reds affiliate called the Wilmington Pirates relocated to Durham and was going to replace the Bulls. The Bulls franchise, however, was re-activated by having the operations of the Wilmington ball club integrated into the Bulls. The Reds then switched affiliations from the former Wilmington ball club to the Bulls and the Bulls continued as the same franchise. On the evening of June 17, 1939, the Durham Athletic Park burned to the ground hours after the Bulls defeated the Portsmouth Cubs 7-3. The groundskeeper, Walter Williams, who was asleep under the grandstand when the blaze began, was able to escape though the fire nearly killed him. Damage costs were more than $100,000. In a remarkable two-week turnaround, Durham Athletic Park was functioning again by July 2, with the old wooden grandstand replaced by concrete and steel. Temporary bleachers were also added and seated 1,000. The crowd that day saw the Bulls beat the Charlotte Hornets 11-4.
A new Durham Athletic Park was finally completed in April 1940, in time for an exhibition game between the Cincinnati Reds and Boston Red Sox, which attracted 5,574 fans. Only 1,587 turned out ten days later for the Bulls&#x27; first game of the season. On September 5, 1943, the last-place Bulls played their last Piedmont League game, beating Richmond 15-5. The following year, the Piedmont League became an all-Virginia league, and there was no baseball in Durham in 1944.
In 1945, a second Carolina League formed. On April 27 the reactivated Bulls played their first game in the new league, defeating the Burlington Bees 5-0. Three years later, in September 1948, Tom Wright, a former Bulls outfielder, became the first Carolina League player to make it to the majors when he debuted with the Boston Red Sox. Three years after that, the Bulls helped make history when their 5-4 loss to the Danville Leafs featured the first black player in Carolina League history, Percy Miller Jr., who played for the Leafs. It would not be until April 18, 1957, that the Bulls fielded African-American players, when third baseman Bubba Morton and pitcher Ted Richardson took the field in a loss to Greensboro. That season also saw the first Carolina League All-Star game played in Durham.

===Raleigh-Durham era (1967–1980)===
In 1967, the Bulls became a New York Mets affiliate. One year later, the Bulls were renamed the Raleigh-Durham Mets. The franchise was renamed because the Bulls acquired the nearby Raleigh Pirates and merged with them. The team still maintained their affiliation with the Mets, playing half of their home games at Durham Athletic Park and half at Devereaux Meadow in Raleigh. The team switched affiliations from the Mets to the Philadelphia Phillies and were renamed the Raleigh-Durham Phillies for the 1969 season. The team hadn&#x27;t been affiliated with the Phillies since the 1932 season. The Phillies abandoned the franchise and the team became independent, renaming themselves the Raleigh-Durham Triangles for the 1970 season. The team played as the Triangles from 1970–1971 and remained independent for both seasons. The franchise disbanded again before the 1972 season, and baseball would not return to Durham until 1980. Also, minor league baseball in Raleigh ended for good. 
For the 1980 season, the Raleigh-Durham Triangles were reformed and renamed back to the Durham Bulls. On June 22 of that same year, the local CBS affiliate, then WTVD in Durham, broadcast the Bulls game locally, the first time that the Bulls had ever been featured on television. The team also became an affiliate of the Atlanta Braves that season and would remain so until 1998.

===The &quot;Bull Durham&quot; years (1988–1994)=== 
Team owner Miles Wolff began pushing for a new ballpark for the Bulls in 1988 in order to attract Triple-A baseball, but stadium plans were pushed back for years. When the film &quot;Bull Durham&quot; was released in mid-1988, it led to a major resurgence of local popular interest in the team and their ballpark. Both the real Bulls and their movie counterparts played in the High-A Carolina League in the late 1980s. On August 30, 1990, a crowd of 6,202 made the Bulls the first Class-A team in history to pass the 300,000 mark in attendance for a season.

The Bulls were sold to the Raleigh-based Capitol Broadcasting Company in 1991. Capitol president Jim Goodmon initially proposed building the new stadium near Raleigh-Durham International Airport, but after city leaders in Durham offered to renovate the old ballpark or help build a new stadium, the current downtown Durham site was secured. In July 1992, the Bulls unveiled their current mascot, Wool E. Bull, a moniker submitted by Durham resident Jim Vickery out of a pool of 500, inspired by the otherwise unrelated novelty song oldie, &quot;Wooly Bully&quot;. The &quot;E&quot; in his name stands for &quot;education.&quot; The next June, the Bulls retired the number 18 belonging to Joe Morgan, the first hall of famer to play for the Bulls, who was a member of the 1963 club (Chipper Jones, who played for the Bulls in 1992, was the second, elected in 2018). Morgan&#x27;s number remained the only one retired by the club for many years; he attended the ceremony where his number was retired. The team also retained the snorting bull sign that was used in &quot;Bull Durham&quot; and it remained at Durham Athletic Park until both team and sign left after the 1994 season.

===DBAP and Triple-A baseball (1995–2003)===
Durham Bulls Athletic Park opened its doors in 1995, complete with a new snorting bull sign. The 1997 season was the final one in which the Bulls were an affiliate of the Atlanta Braves and also their last year in the High-A Carolina League. In 1998, the franchise moved two levels up to Triple-A and joined the International League (IL), in part because of their popularity as the main team in &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, and also because the Triple-A leagues needed two more teams to accommodate affiliates for the Major League Baseball expansion teams Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Arizona Diamondbacks. Wolff&#x27;s dream of attracting Triple-A baseball came true when the Bulls became the Triple-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now Tampa Bay Rays), who have remained their parent club ever since. DBAP expanded its seating capacity due to the move. 1998 also saw the Bulls play their first game outside the United States when they played road games against the Ottawa Lynx (now the Lehigh Valley IronPigs), though it would be another year before they recorded their first win in Canada.

The Bulls&#x27; second appearance on film was in &quot;The Rookie&quot;, released in 2002. It starred Dennis Quaid as Jim Morris, a baseball pitcher who is now retired. The real Jim Morris did play for the Bulls briefly during the 1999 season and was then called up to the major leagues on September 18, 1999, at the age of 35. He made his debut against Royce Clayton of the Texas Rangers, striking him out on four pitches. Morris made four more appearances later that year.
The 2001 season saw the Bulls set single-game (10,916 on July 23) and full-season (505,319 set on September 1) attendance records. The Bulls celebrated their 100th anniversary season in 2002. On September 12, 2002, the Bulls won their first IL championship, defeating the Buffalo Bisons 2-0 for the Governors&#x27; Cup. In 2003, Durham became the first club in the 119-year history of the championship to sweep back-to-back final playoff series, defeating the Pawtucket Red Sox.

===Championships and success (2005–2015)===
After missing the playoffs for the 2005 and 2006 seasons, the Bulls captured the 2007 South Division title with an 80-64 regular season record. Durham defeated the Toledo Mud Hens in a three-game sweep during the first round of the playoffs, but were defeated three games to two in the Governors&#x27; Cup Final by the Richmond Braves (now Gwinnett Braves). 2007 was also the first season of Charlie Montoyo as Bulls manager, replacing Bill Evers. In 2008, with a record of 74-70 the Bulls would once again win the South Division. After defeating the Louisville Bats three games to one in the first round, the Bulls again lost the championship, this time in four games to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees.

In 2009, they won the division for a third consecutive season with an 83-61 record. Facing the Louisville Bats in the first round again, the Bulls were victorious, winning in five games. The third time was the charm for the Bulls in the Governors&#x27; Cup final, as they dethroned the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in three games to win the championship, their third since joining the International League. The Bulls advanced to the Triple-A Baseball National Championship Game against the champions of the Pacific Coast League for the first time in team history, as that championship game did not exist at the time of the Bulls&#x27; previous two Governors&#x27; Cup championships. Facing the Memphis Redbirds, the Bulls would win their first class championship, scoring the winning run on a wild pitch in the bottom half of the 11th inning. Also in 2009, the Bulls retired the number 8 of Crash Davis, the main character of &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, which was their first number retirement in 16 years.

On August 19, 2010, the Bulls won their fourth straight division championship. Almost two weeks later, the Bulls set the Triple-A wins record winning their 84th game of the 2010 season. On August 2, 2011, the Bulls defeated the Charlotte Knights, the Chicago White Sox affiliate, 18-3 for their 6,000th win in franchise history. The team retired the number 20 of longtime general manager Bill Evers the following year. In 2013, the team won its fourth Governors&#x27; Cup title, defeating the Pawtucket Red Sox in the International League Final. The same year the number 10, belonging to former Bulls player Chipper Jones, was retired. Following a $20 million renovation to the DBAP, the Bulls hosted the 27th Triple-A All-Star Game on July 16, 2014, which saw the International League prevail 7-3 over the Pacific Coast League. Montoyo became the franchise&#x27;s all-time winningest manager on July 21, earning his 614th victory to pass Evers. On August 31, 2014, the Bulls again broke their all-time paid attendance record, finishing the year with a cumulative mark of 533,033.

===Changes and a second championship (2015–2019)===
Before the 2015 season, Jared Sandberg was named the fourth manager in the team&#x27;s Triple-A history, replacing Montoyo. The 2015 season saw the Bulls set both a new single-game paid attendance record on July 4, and a new single-season paid attendance record, finishing with a cumulative mark of 554,788. In 2016, the Bulls had the franchise&#x27;s second-highest attendance numbers and retired Montoyo&#x27;s number 25. Overall, the team had their fourth losing season since 1998 and missed the playoffs. 
2017 proved a watershed year for the Bulls, as they captured their first South Division championship since 2014 with an 86-56 record. The Bulls then won their second Triple-A National Championship, defeating the Memphis Redbirds after beating the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders for their fifth Governors&#x27; Cup title. Success continued in 2018; the team went 79-60 and won their second straight South Division championship and Governor&#x27;s Cup before falling to Memphis in the National Championship.

Sandberg left before the 2019 season for a position with the Seattle Mariners. The Bulls hired Brady Williams as their 5th Triple-A manager. The team finished 2019 with a 75-64 record, making the playoffs as a wild card, and advanced to the Governor&#x27;s Cup before losing to Columbus. After the season, &quot;Baseball America&quot; named the Bulls the most successful MiLB franchise of the 2010s.

===Lost season, reorganization, and more championships (2020–present)=== 

As a consequence of the worldwide onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Minor League Baseball announced on June 30, 2020, that no season would be held, meaning that the Durham Bulls would not take the field again until the following spring.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Bulls were organized into the Triple-A East. In their first season in the league, the Bulls claimed the Triple-A East&#x27;s championship with a 77–43 record. After the conclusion of the regular season, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Durham won the tournament with a 9–1 record. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, which the Bulls had been members of since their move up to Triple-A.

Manager Brady Williams led the 2022 Bulls to win the Eastern Division title with a 86–64 record. They then defeated the Nashville Sounds, winners of the Western Division, in a single playoff game, 13–0, to win the IL championship. Durham faced the Reno Aces for the Triple-A championship, winning 10–6.

Playing under a split-season format in 2023 in which the teams with the best league-wide records at the end of each half qualified for the playoffs, Durham won the second-half title at 48–27. Overall, the team posted the league&#x27;s second-best record, 88–62. In a single round of playoffs for the IL championship versus the Norfolk Tides, winners of the first-half, the Bulls were defeated, two games to one.

<text>The Rochester Red Wings are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals. They are located in Rochester, New York, and play their home games at Innovative Field, located in downtown Rochester. Founded in 1899, they are the oldest continuously operating sports franchise in North America below the major league level.

Since the widespread adoption of the minor league farm system in the 1920s, the Red Wings have been affiliated with four Major League Baseball clubs, an unusually stable series of relationships. They were the top farm team of the St. Louis Cardinals for 32 years (1929–1960), Baltimore Orioles for 42 years (1961–2002), and Minnesota Twins for 18 years (2003–2020). They then became the Triple-A affiliate of the Nationals in 2021.

The franchise played from 1929 through 1996 at Silver Stadium (called Red Wing Stadium from 1929 to 1968) and moved to Frontier Field in 1997.

The Red Wings, along with the Pawtucket Red Sox, hold the record for the longest professional baseball game, lasting a total of 33 innings and 8 hours, 25 minutes over the course of three different days. The game was held at Pawtucket&#x27;s McCoy Stadium, beginning on April 18, 1981. It was suspended just after 4 a.m. the next morning, and Rochester lost, 3–2, when the game resumed on June 23, 1981.

==Baseball in Rochester==
Baseball in Rochester dates back to 1877 with the &quot;Rochesters&quot; of the International Association, and Rochester has had a franchise in the league now known as the International League as early as 1885.

According to Rochester sports historian Douglas Brei, only six franchises in the history of North American professional sports have been playing in the same city and same league continuously and uninterrupted since the 19th century: the Rochester Red Wings, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals. He also reports that the Red Wings and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League are the only two franchises in North American professional sports to have captured a league championship in every decade of the 20th century.

==Franchise history==
===Early history (1899–1928)===
The current franchise has been playing in Rochester since 1899, when the team was known as the Rochester Bronchos and won the Eastern League championship in its inaugural season.

===Cardinals era (1929–1960)===
The Red Wings became the Triple-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals in . Aside from the affiliation, the Cardinals also owned the Wings and their stadium, then known as Red Wing Stadium. The early years of the Cardinals and Red Wings saw the Red Wings very much a power house, not unlike their parent club. The team was managed by Billy Southworth (who split time managing the team in 1929 with Bill McKechnie), and from 1929 to 1931, the team won the International League championship. In a true statement of how dominant a team they were, they won 103 games in 1929, 105 games in 1930, and 101 games in 1931. The team would remain competitive for many years, with 1935 and 1937 being the only years that they lost more games than they won. The return of Billy Southworth in 1939 brought another league championship to Rochester.

Lean times were ahead for Rochester, with the 1940s finding the Red Wings on the bottom half of the standings. Even former famed pitcher Burleigh Grimes could not change the team&#x27;s fortunes. He lasted a little more than a season and a half when he was replaced by Bennie Borgmann. The team would capture three more league championships in the Cardinals era, those coming in 1952, 1955, and 1956. In the fall of , the Cardinals ceased to operate the Red Wings and put both the team and the stadium up for sale. In response, Morrie Silver, a Rochester businessman, formed Rochester Community Baseball, Inc. (RCB) and spearheaded a drive to sell shares in RCB to raise money to buy the Red Wings and Red Wing Stadium to ensure that the franchise would remain in Rochester. The attempt was successful as RCB purchased both entities from the Cardinals on February 27, 1957, in an event that was dubbed the &quot;72 Day Miracle&quot;. RCB, composed of fans of the team as shareholders, continues to own and operate the club to this day, making the Red Wings one of two current American professional sports franchises that are publicly owned. The Green Bay Packers of the National Football League are the most notable example of this distinction.

In 1959, the Red Wings were involved in one of minor league baseball&#x27;s most infamous games. While playing in Havana, Cuba, the Red Wings&#x27; July 25 game against the Havana Sugar Kings was interrupted at midnight by gunfire and fireworks in celebration of the 26th of July Movement. Rochester&#x27;s Frank Verdi, standing in as third-base coach in place of manager Cot Deal, who had been ejected earlier in the game, was grazed by a bullet, as was Leo Cárdenas, the Sugar Kings&#x27; shortstop. Neither player was seriously injured, but both the game and then the series were canceled.

The Wings remained St. Louis&#x27; affiliate until , when the Red Wings moved on to become the top farm club of the Baltimore Orioles.

===Orioles era (1961–2002)===
After two straight fourth-place finishes, and early exits from the playoffs, the Red Wings dismissed Clyde King, a hold over from the Cardinals era, as manager of the team, and named Darrell Johnson in his place. Johnson never managed a finish better than fourth during his tenure, however, in 1964, with an 82–72 record, Johnson&#x27;s Red Wings managed to win yet another championship. He was replaced by Earl Weaver, who showed great promise as a manager. After two seasons, Weaver was brought up to manage the Baltimore Orioles, and he was replaced by Billy DeMars, who lasted one season before being replaced by Cal Ripken Sr. After two seasons, Ripken was replaced by Joe Altobelli. Red Wing Stadium was renamed Silver Stadium in honor of Morrie Silver on August 19, 1968. From 1971 to 1976, the Red Wings never missed the playoffs, capturing two more league titles in the process in 1971 and 1974. Altobelli returned to the Red Wings after his retirement from the coaching ranks, serving as general manager from late 1991 to 1994 and then as part of the radio broadcasting team through 2008.

1978 was a terrible season for the Red Wings, as the club had three managers, Ken Boyer, Al Widmar, and Frank Robinson. The team finished 68–72. Robinson was replaced by Doc Edwards, who managed to get the team to the playoffs in 1980, but could not manage a league title. Edwards was soon gone, replaced by Lance Nicholls, who in turn, was replaced by former Tidewater Tides manager Frank Verdi. The team did horribly under Verdi, and was mainly stocked with cast off former major leaguers, career minor league players, and very few prospects. The only bona fide major league prospect on the team during this lean period was Larry Sheets, who was mainly a journeyman hitter during his career.

Verdi was fired midway through 1985, with the Red Wings at 18–40. Under his replacement, first base coach Mark Wiley, the Red Wings went 40–41 the rest of the season.

There would be a return to glory, when the Red Wings named John Hart as the new manager. He was able to guide the team into the playoffs during his two-year stint, but none resulted in a championship. However, Hart impressed the Orioles, and he was soon off to the majors. His replacement was former New York Yankees catcher Johnny Oates. Oates won the league title in his first year and only year at the helm. His replacement was Greg Biagini. In 1990, Biagini led a loaded Red Wings team, which featured future Red Sox hero Curt Schilling, to the league championship.

In 1993, the Red Wings, guided by manager Bob Miscik, reached the International League finals but lost to the Charlotte Knights in five games.

In 1997, the Red Wings moved into the new Frontier Field in downtown Rochester after 68 seasons at Silver Stadium on the city&#x27;s northeast side. That same year, manager Marv Foley led the Wings to a league title.

In 2000, during the team&#x27;s fourth year at the stadium, the Red Wings played host to the Triple-A All-Star Game.

Rochester won six Governors&#x27; Cup titles during their 42-year affiliation with the Orioles, with the last coming in . The team&#x27;s fortunes began to decline by , though, as the product on the field slipped in quality. By , the fifth consecutive losing season for Rochester and what would be the last year of the player development agreement between Baltimore and Rochester, the team&#x27;s record slipped to a league-worst 55–89. The Red Wings&#x27; affiliation with the Orioles ended when it signed a working agreement with the Minnesota Twins on September 17, 2002.

===Twins era (2003–2020)===

The Red Wings&#x27; first season as the Twins&#x27; Triple-A affiliate was the team&#x27;s sixth consecutive losing season. Beginning in , however, the team began to turn their fortunes around. In both 2004 and , the Red Wings finished in second place in the North Division with records of 73–71 and 75–69, respectively. The turnaround was capped in when Rochester, now under the leadership of Stan Cliburn, advanced to the International League playoffs as the Wild Card with a record of 79–64. The Red Wings then beat the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons three games to one in the best-of-five semifinal series but lost to the Toledo Mud Hens in five games, three games to two, in the best-of-five Governors&#x27; Cup series.

Rochester followed up their run to the 2006 Governors&#x27; Cup Finals by posting a winning record in each of the next two seasons, bringing the streak of consecutive winning seasons to five. In , the team went 74–70 after being as far as 13 games under .500 at one point (19–32 on May 25). The streak was snapped in after the team finished 70–74. On September 21, 2009, the Minnesota Twins announced that they would not renew manager Stan Cliburn&#x27;s contract for the 2010 season. According to Twins farm director Jim Rantz, the change was made as part of an &quot;overall directional change that is being implemented throughout the minor-league system.&quot; Former New Britain Rock Cats manager Tom Nieto was Cliburn&#x27;s replacement. Nieto was fired at the close of the 2011 season after leading the Red Wings to their first back-to-back 90-loss seasons since 1903–04.

On November 25, 2011 Gene Glynn was announced as the new Red Wings manager for 2012. The 2012 season saw the Red Wings scratch out a .500 record, considered a vast improvement over the Nieto years. With Glynn continuing as manager, the 2013 Wings got off to a dismal 2–11 start, but slowly improved before turning red-hot in July. At some points they led the North Division, but a late surge by Pawtucket relegated the Wings to a fight for the IL&#x27;s lone wild card spot. They secured the wild card on the last day of the season, based on a tiebreaker with the Norfolk Tides, leading the Wings to their first postseason appearance since 2006. The following season&#x27;s playoff push came down to the final series of the year in Pawtucket, but a loss on August 31 put them out of the picture for good.

After the 2014 season, Gene Glynn was promoted to become the third base coach for the major league Minnesota Twins.

To replace Glynn, the Red Wings announced on January 30, 2015, that former Chicago Cubs&#x27; manager Mike Quade would be taking over for the 2015 season, a position he retained for three years through the 2017 campaign.

On January 17, 2018 former MLB catcher, coach and manager Joel Skinner was named as the 45th manager of the team.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30.

On November 10, 2020, Twins management disclosed to the Red Wings that they would be discontinuing their partnership as part of the broad changes in the minor league system for the 2021 season and beyond.

===Nationals era (2021–present)===

Beginning with the 2021 season, the Red Wings became the Triple-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals. As a further result of Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Red Wings were organized into the Triple-A East. Under former major league catcher and veteran minor league coach Matthew LeCroy, Rochester ended the 2021 season tied for fifth place in the Northeastern Division with a 47–69 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Rochester finished the tournament in 27th place with a 2–8 record. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. In 2023 the Red Wings finished 8th in the 10-team IL East Division with a 66-80 record under Matt LeCroy.

<text>Marganus (&quot;Welsh:&quot; Margan) was a legendary king of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He came to power in 850BC.

He was the son of Maglaurus, Duke of Albany, and Goneril, the daughter of King Leir.

Marganus, grandson of Leir, despised the rule of his aunt Cordelia in Britain. With the help of his cousin Cunedagius, Marganus took over the kingdom from Cordelia and ruled half of it. Following Cordelia&#x27;s suicide, Marganus came to rule the region of Britain northeast of the Humber.

Marganus was eldest male heir of Leir and, influenced by his peers, became discontent with ruling only half of Britain. He began a scorched earth march through Cornwall until reaching the army of Cunedagius. Cunedagius defeated Marganus and Marganus fled. Cunedagius followed him throughout Britain until cornering him in Wales. There, Cunedagius killed Marganus and became king of all Britain. He named the place Margon in honour of his cousin.

==Later tradition==
Marganus and Cunedagius&#x27; conflict is mentioned twice in Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville&#x27;s play &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561), as a warning against the possibility of civil strife:
&quot;Morgan slaine did yeld his conquered parte unto his cosins sworde in Camberland&quot; (Act I, Scene II); &quot;the cruell sworde bereft Morgan his life with cosyns hand&quot; (Act III, Scene I).

<doc id="671167" wikidata="Q2444182" url="?curid=671167" title="Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders">
<text>The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, often abbreviated to SWB RailRiders, are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League (IL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. They are located in Moosic, Pennsylvania, in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area, and are named in reference to Northeastern Pennsylvania being home to the first trolley system in the United States. The RailRiders have played their home games at PNC Field since its opening in 1989.

Founded as members of the International League in 1989, the team was known as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons during their affiliation with the Philadelphia Phillies from 1989 to 2006. They became known as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in 2007 after affiliating with the New York Yankees. They rebranded as the RailRiders in 2013. The RailRiders became members of the Triple-A East in 2021, but this league was renamed the International League in 2022.

Scranton/Wilkes-Barre has won two International League championships (2008 and 2016) and one Triple-A National Championship (2016).

== History ==
=== Prior professional baseball in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area ===
Professional baseball teams first played in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre (SWB) area of Pennsylvania in the late 19th century. In Scranton, the predominant moniker of these teams was the Scranton Miners, who originated in 1886 as the Scranton Indians, though they were also known as Coal Heavers and Red Sox throughout their history. The Miners&#x27; last season was in 1953 as members of the Eastern League. The franchise was surrendered to the league after it was unable to secure backing by a Major League Baseball team for 1954. In Wilkes-Barre, the Wilkes-Barre Barons, originally the Coal Barons, who were established in 1886, played their last season in the Eastern League in 1955. Financial problems resulted in the relocation of the franchise to Johnstown during the 1955 season.

=== Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons (1989–2006) ===
Over three decades after Minor League Baseball left the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area, the Maine Phillies were relocated from Old Orchard Beach, Maine, to Lackawanna County in 1989. A group from Scranton, called Northeast Baseball, Inc. (NBI), purchased the team in 1987. The previous owner tried to renege on the sale, but after a lengthy court battle, NBI won control of the franchise and moved forward with its relocation. The team was renamed the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons in reference to the Scranton Red Sox and the Wilkes-Barre Barons, who had preceded them. They were to play in the International League (IL) as the Triple-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, as had the franchise in Maine. Their home ballpark was the newly-constructed Lackawanna County Stadium, later renamed PNC Field, located in nearby Moosic, Pennsylvania.

The Red Barons struggled in their early years, finishing under .500 in their first three seasons. In 1992, manager Lee Elia led SWB to an 84–58 record and the Eastern Division title. In the playoffs, they defeated the Pawtucket Red Sox in the semifinals but lost the league championship versus the Columbus Clippers. The Red Barons posted losing records for the next six seasons.

Marc Bombard took over as manager in 1997 and led the club to four consecutive postseason appearances from 1999 to 2002. The 1999 Northern Division champion Red Barons were eliminated from the playoffs in the semifinals by the Charlotte Knights. In 2000, the team missed winning the division but qualified for the IL wild card spot. They defeated the Buffalo Bisons in the semifinals but fell to the Indianapolis Indians in the championship round. Another wild card berth in 2001 sent SWB back to the playoffs. They won the semifinals over Buffalo, 3–2, and advanced to face the Louisville RiverBats for the league title. After losing Game One of the series, the postseason came to abrupt end when it was cancelled in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Louisville, with a 1–0 series lead, was declared the champion. The Red Barons returned to the playoffs in 2002 with the Northern Division title but were eliminated by Buffalo in the semifinals. They made one more postseason appearance as the Red Barons and as a Phillies affiliate in 2006 via a division title win, but the Rochester Red Wings ended their championship hopes in the semifinals.

Following the 2006 season, the Philadelphia Phillies ended their affiliation with the Red Barons and signed a player development contract with the Ottawa Lynx in anticipation of that team&#x27;s move to Allentown&#x27;s new Coca-Cola Park as the Lehigh Valley IronPigs for the 2008 season.

=== Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees (2007–2012) ===
In 2007, the club became the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Yankees and rebranded as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. In terms of regular-season records and championships, the Yankees affiliation has been more successful than that with the Phillies. From 2007 to 2009, the SWB Yankees made four consecutive trips to the postseason, all by virtue of winning the Northern Division title. The 2007 team was eliminated in the semifinal round by the Richmond Braves. In 2008, the Yankees won another division title with an 88–56 record behind manager Dave Miley. After defeating Pawtucket in the semifinals, 3–1, the Yankees beat the Durham Bulls, 3–1, in the final round to earn the Governors&#x27; Cup, their first IL championship. This qualified them for the Bricktown Showdown, a single game against the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s champion to determine an overall champion of the Triple-A classification. They lost the Triple-A championship versus the Sacramento River Cats by a score of 4–1. SWB won the 2009 semifinals over the Gwinnett Braves, 3–1, but were swept by Durham in the finals, 3–0. The 2010 team was eliminated by Columbus in the semifinals. 

In November 2010, the Lackawanna County Multipurpose Stadium Authority voted to sell the SWB Yankees to Mandalay Baseball Properties, which planned a $40-million renovation of PNC Field. However, negotiations stalled the actual sale for over a year. The sale was finalized on April 26, 2012, with the franchise being sold to SWB Yankees LLC, an ownership entity that was a joint venture between the New York Yankees and Mandalay.
====Empire State Yankees====
The SWB Yankees chose to temporarily relocate their operations for the 2012 season to allow major renovations to PNC Field to be completed in one season, rather than being spread over two to three years. The team based itself in Rochester, New York, at Frontier Field, home of Red Wings. They played their entire schedule on the road, often being designated as the home team at an opponent&#x27;s ballpark. In addition to Frontier Field, the Yankees also played home games at Dwyer Stadium in Batavia, New York; Alliance Bank Stadium in Syracuse, New York; Coca-Cola Field in Buffalo, New York; Coca-Cola Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania; and McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The team was known as the Empire State Yankees in the 2012 season for promotional purposes, though it retained its official SWB Yankees moniker. After missing the playoffs in 2011, the Yankees returned in 2012 by winning the Northern Division title, but they were eliminated by Pawtucket in the semifinals.

=== Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders (2013–present) ===

In anticipation of their return to the renovated PNC Field in 2013, a name-the-team contest was launched to select a new moniker for the SWB franchise. Among the finalists were &quot;Blast&quot;, &quot;Black Diamond Bears&quot;, &quot;Fireflies&quot;, &quot;Porcupines&quot;, and &quot;Trolley Frogs&quot;. The chosen name, &quot;RailRiders&quot;, is in reference to Northeastern Pennsylvania being home to the first trolley system in the United States. Although RailRiders received the most first-place votes by fans, Porcupines received the most overall fan votes on the ballots ranked one through three. As a result, a porcupine was incorporated in the RailRiders&#x27; logos.

The 2013 and 2014 RailRiders finished under .500 and did not qualify for the postseason. In September 2014, Mandalay Baseball Properties sold its 50% interest in the team to SWB Investors LLC, a group consisting of David Abrams, David Blitzer, Grant Cagle, and Michael Hisler, for approximately $14 million. The RailRiders returned to the playoffs in 2015 with a Northern Division title win, but they were swept out of the semifinals by Indianapolis. After nine seasons, six division titles, and one league championship, the 2015 season was the last for Dave Miley as the team&#x27;s manager.

Al Pedrique was hired to lead the team in 2016. SWB finished with a league-best 91–52 record and another Northern Division title. They swept Lehigh Valley, 3–0, in the semifinals and won their second Governors&#x27; Cup over Gwinnett, 3–1. The IL championship qualified them for the Triple-A National Championship Game versus the El Paso Chihuahuas, where they won, 3–1, claiming their second Triple-A championship.

The 2017 RailRiders won the division title and defeated Lehigh Valley in the semifinals but lost the IL championship to Durham. The 2018 club made another postseason run via a wild card berth. Like in the previous season, they advanced to the finals by beating Lehigh Valley but again lost in the finals to Durham. The RailRiders finished the 2019 season tied for first place with the Syracuse Mets, each with a 75–65 record. On September 3, SWB defeated Syracuse in a one-game playoff, 14–13, to win the Northern Division title. They were, however, swept in the playoff semifinals by Durham. 

The start of the 2020 season was initially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled altogether.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the RailRiders were organized into the Triple-A East. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. SWB placed third in the league standings with a 68–49 record under manager Doug Davis, who had been with the club as a coach since 2017. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. The RailRiders finished the tournament in sixth place with a 7–3 record. 

In December 2021, SWB Investors sold their 50% stake in the club to Diamond Baseball Holdings. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. Davis returned to the club for his second season as manager, leading the team to an 83–67 record, finishing second in the ten-team East Division.

==Season-by-season records==


==Uniforms==

The RailRiders&#x27; primary home uniform is white with navy blue pinstripes, mirroring those of the New York Yankees. The primary home jersey features a descending &quot;SWB&quot; logo on train tracks on the left chest and a navy interlocking New York Yankees &quot;NY&quot; logo on the right sleeve. The home cap is navy with a golden &quot;R&quot; set against a railroad track. The team&#x27;s road uniform is gray with &quot;RailRiders&quot; across the jersey&#x27;s chest and is worn with a navy cap with a white interlocking &quot;SWB&quot; logo.

An alternate solid navy jersey was introduced in 2022, featuring the white interlocking &quot;SWB&quot; crest on the left chest and a white interlocking New York Yankees &quot;NY&quot; logo on the right sleeve. These are worn with the navy cap feature the same &quot;SWB&quot; logo.

==Radio and television==

SWB&#x27;s first radio play-by-play announcer was Kent Westling, a former local television sportscaster who previously worked on telecasts of the St. Louis Blues hockey team. While cutting back on his schedule in later years, he retired following the 2007 season after having called over 2,000 games since the team&#x27;s inaugural 1989 campaign. Mike Vander Woude served as the team&#x27;s second play-by-play announcer from 2008 until 2012. He was followed by John Sadak from 2013 to 2017. Adam Marco has been the &quot;Voice of the RailRiders&quot; since 2018.

All RailRiders home and road games are broadcast by WICK across their five frequencies in Northeastern Pennsylvania: 1400 WICK (Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties), 1440 WCDL (Lackawanna County and Pocono Lake Region), 93.5 FM (Scranton and Northern Lackawanna County), 106.7 FM (Wayne and Pike Counties), and 107.9 FM (Lackawanna County).

<text>Reedy Island is a small island in the middle of the channel of the Delaware River near its mouth on the Delaware Bay in the U.S. state of Delaware. It is about east of Port Penn, Delaware and southwest of Salem, New Jersey.

The island was the location of Reedy Island Range Front Light and the Reedy Island Quarantine Station. The Reedy Island Range Rear Light, in nearby Taylors Bridge, is a historic lighthouse first established in 1910. The light is operated by the United States Coast Guard. The nearby keeper&#x27;s house was destroyed in 2002.

<doc id="671169" wikidata="Q27609" url="?curid=671169" title="Cicuta virosa">
<text>Cicuta virosa, the cowbane or northern water hemlock, is a poisonous species of &quot;Cicuta&quot;, native to northern and central Europe, northern Asia and northwestern North America.

==Description==

It is a perennial herbaceous plant which grows up to 1–2 m tall. The stems are smooth, branching, swollen at the base, purple-striped, and hollow except for partitions at the junction of the leaves and stem. In cross section the stems have one flat side and the other sides are rounded. The leaves are alternate, tripinnate, only coarsely toothed, unlike the ferny, lacy leaves found in many other members of the family &quot;Apiaceae&quot;. The flowers are small, white and clustered in umbrella shaped inflorescences typical of the family. The many flowered umbellets have unequal pedicels that range from 5 to 11 cm long during fruiting. An oily, yellow liquid oozes from cuts to the stems and roots. This liquid has a rank smell resembling that of parsnips or carrots. The plant may be mistaken for parsnip due to its clusters of white tuberous roots.

It grows in wet meadows, along streambanks and other wet and marshy areas.

==History==
Scholars dispute whether a hemlock of the genus &quot;Cicuta&quot; or the genus &quot;Conium&quot; served in ancient Greece as a state poison, administered as a method of capital punishment. The Greek philosopher Socrates drank a cup of some kind of hemlock infusion at his execution in 399 BC. &quot;Cicuta virosa&quot; is however primarily a northern European species, rare or absent from the Mediterranean region, making its use in Greece unlikely. See Poison hemlock for more information.

The dose of hemlock used for Greek executions was not always immediately fatal, and sometimes it proved necessary to administer a second cup of the poison.

:&quot;...having drunk all the Hemlock juice, the quantity was found insufficient and the executioner refused to prepare more unless he was paid 12 drachmas.&quot;
:—from an account of the execution of Phocion in 318 BC

Considering the extreme toxicity of &quot;Cicuta virosa&quot;, this passage provides further evidence that it was not the species of hemlock used.

In the past, this plant has had a number of colorful names, including Mackenzie&#x27;s water hemlock, Beaver-poison, Children&#x27;s-bane, Snakeweed and Musquash-poison.

==Toxicity==

The plant contains cicutoxin, which disrupts the workings of the central nervous system. In humans, cicutoxin rapidly produces symptoms of nausea, emesis and abdominal pain, typically within 60 minutes of ingestion. Poisoning can lead to tremors and seizures. A single bite of the root (which has the highest concentration of cicutoxin) can be sufficient to cause death. In animals the toxic dose and the lethal dose are nearly the same. One gram of water hemlock per kilogram of weight will kill a sheep and 230 grams is sufficient to kill a horse. Due to the rapid onset of symptoms, treatment is usually unsuccessful.

==Fossil record==
&quot;Cicuta virosa&quot; fossil fruit halves are described rare in the Pliocene of Europe but common in the Pleistocene interglacial floras of the East European Plain.

<text>The Syracuse Mets are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Mets. They are located in Syracuse, New York, and play their home games at NBT Bank Stadium, which opened in 1997 and has a seating capacity of 10,815. The Mets are named for their major league affiliate and former owner, the New York Mets.

Throughout most of its existence, from 1934 to 1996 and again from 2007 to 2018, the team was known as the Syracuse Chiefs, while from 1997 to 2006 it was known as the Syracuse SkyChiefs. The club was rebranded as the Syracuse Mets in October 2018.

==History==
=== Syracuse Chiefs ===

==== Establishment (1934–1957) ====
The Syracuse Chiefs baseball team was established in 1934, when the Jersey City Skeeters moved to Syracuse and were renamed the Chiefs. The team played in the International League (IL) through 1955. They won five Governors&#x27; Cup championships during this stretch, including back-to-back championships in 1942 and 1943. The team was then sold and moved to Miami as the Marlins for the 1956 campaign. Another team known as the Syracuse Chiefs competed in the Class A Eastern League (then two levels below the IL) in 1956 and 1957, but moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 1957. The Chiefs played at MacArthur Stadium from 1934 to 1996, moving to new then-P&amp;C Stadium (1997–2005) in 1997.

==== Restart and multiple affiliations (1961–1978) ====
Syracuse was without professional baseball from 1957 until 1961, when the Montreal Royals franchise was abandoned by its owners (the Los Angeles Dodgers) and relocated to Syracuse as the top affiliate of the Minnesota Twins, becoming the Syracuse Chiefs. After that, the team had affiliations with the New York Mets and Washington Senators (1962), the Detroit Tigers (1963) and the New York Yankees (1967–1977). Baseball has been played in Syracuse without interruption since the rebirth of the Chiefs in 1961.

==== Toronto Blue Jays (1978–2008) ====
From 1978 to 2008, the Chiefs were the Triple-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. The three-decade Toronto–Syracuse affiliation is the longest of the 11 major league affiliations the team has had since 1936. While the Chiefs reached three Governors Cup finals during this time, many of the players who helped lead the Blue Jays to consecutive World Series titles in 1992 and 1993 passed through Syracuse. In 1994, outfielder Shawn Green hit .344 for the Chiefs, winning the International League batting title and the International League Rookie of the Year Award. The team was renamed the SkyChiefs in 1997 before reverting to simply &quot;Chiefs&quot; in December 2006.

==== Washington Nationals (2008–2018) ====
On September 20, 2008, the Chiefs signed a two-year affiliation agreement with the Washington Nationals, ending their relationship with the Blue Jays. That first season, the players wore a decal on their uniforms with the letters &quot;HB&quot; to commemorate Harold Berman, former member of the team&#x27;s board of directors, who died after the 2007 season. In 2009, the Chiefs wore a decal on their uniforms with the letters &quot;HM&quot; to commemorate Hy Miller, former state assemblyman and former member of the team&#x27;s board of directors, who died after the 2008 season.

In 2010, the Chiefs celebrated their 50th season of community-owned baseball (1961–2010), wearing 1961 jerseys for every Thursday home game. The team brought back radio announcers from the past, such as Dan Hoard and Syracuse University alumnus Sean McDonough. They had a 76–67 win–loss record, with pitching prospect Stephen Strasburg winning two games and losing one in five appearances.

In 2011, the Chiefs, wore throwback jerseys for every Thursday home game to commemorate the 35th anniversary of their last International League Governors&#x27; Cup championship team (managed by Syracuse Wall of Fame member Bobby Cox). The Chiefs added four alternate jerseys to their rotation for the season: one for Latin American Day, a second for Jackie Robinson Day (commemorating Negro league uniforms), a third for national holidays such as Independence Day and Memorial Day, and a fourth for Breast Cancer Awareness Night. The team played the Pawtucket Red Sox on August 20 at Fenway Park as part of a doubleheader in conjunction with the sixth annual Futures at Fenway event, featuring games involving Boston Red Sox minor league teams. The Chiefs, behind starter Brad Meyers, defeated the PawSox 3–1 before more than 29,000 fans. At Alliance Bank Stadium (now NBT Bank Stadium) the Chiefs added a &quot;Home Plate Club&quot; to the stadium: premium seating in the first four rows behind home plate, with waitstaff for merchandise, food and drinks.

On May 14, Chiefs DH Michael Aubrey went four for four, hitting four home runs in an 11–0 victory over the Durham Bulls and becoming the second player in team history to hit four home runs in a game; Gene Locklear was the first, on July 14, 1977. On August 27, Stephen Strasburg pitched his only rehab game for the Chiefs, against the Rochester Red Wings. Giving up two hits in the sixth inning (his only hits allowed before departing, with the Chiefs leading 1–0), he received no decision in Syracuse&#x27;s 4–3 win. It did, however, clinch the Chiefs&#x27; third Thruway Cup victory; the team&#x27;s other wins were in 1999 and 2010. The club&#x27;s record for the season was 66–74, 14 games out of first place and fourth place in the six-team North Division.

On April 5, 2012, the Chiefs opened at home against the Rochester Red Wings. Top draft pick Bryce Harper, later that month promoted to the Nationals, made the opening-day roster. Randy Knorr did not return for a second season as manager, and Tony Beasley was promoted from the Harrisburg Senators. The Chiefs played all 16 of their games against the Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees at the now renamed Alliance Bank Stadium (2005–2013) due to stadium renovations at the Yankees&#x27; ballpark in Moosic, Pennsylvania. On May 7, the Chiefs unveiled a new high-definition video board in left field, replacing the board which had been in place since the stadium&#x27;s 1997 opening.

The 2013 season, with manager Tony Beasley in his second season with the team, began on April 4 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, against the Lehigh Valley IronPigs; the Chiefs&#x27; home opener was eight days later against the IronPigs. On Throwback Thursdays, the team wore jerseys from 1983 to 1996.

On September 30, 2013, it was announced that 16-year general manager John Simone and any family members associated with the team, including assistant GM Mike Vounitas, were fired. On October 8, former Auburn Doubledays general manager Jason Smorol became the Chiefs&#x27; GM, with Jason Horbal as his assistant. It was the first time since 1970 that someone not named Simone was general manager of Syracuse; John Simone had taken over the job from his father, Anthony (Tex) Simone, in 1997.

The Chiefs opened their 2014 season on April 3 with a loss at home to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders and finished the season with the best record (81–62) in the International League, clinching a playoff spot for the first time since 1998 and the first IL North Division title since 1989. NBT Bank Stadium hosted its first ever playoff game on September 5, 2014, a 7–6 loss to the Pawtucket Red Sox which capped off a 3–0 first round series sweep for the Red Sox. The season featured an aggressive promotional campaign, including Social Media Monday, Two-for-One Tickets on Tuesday, Winning Wednesday, Dollar Thursday, Fireworks Friday, Giveaway Saturday, and Family Sunday. The Chiefs sold out the outfield wall, the dugouts, and the field tarp, earning $500,000 in advertising.

Following the 2014 season, the Chiefs would not make the playoffs during the final years of the Nationals&#x27; affiliation, including a 54–87 record during the 2017 season, their worst since 1966. Many prospects passed through Syracuse on their way to MLB, including Trea Turner, Lucas Giolito, and Victor Robles. Randy Knorr replaced Gardner Jr. after 4 seasons as Chiefs&#x27; manager for the 2018 season, his second stint with the Chiefs.

=== Syracuse Mets ===

The chief operating officer of the New York Mets, Jeff Wilpon, joined Governor Andrew Cuomo and Joanie Mahoney, Onondaga County Executive, at NBT Bank Stadium on October 11, 2017, to announce that the Mets would purchase the Chiefs from the Community Baseball Club of Central New York in early 2018. Under the deal, the Chiefs&#x27; affiliation with the Washington Nationals continued through the end of the 2018 season, with the Chiefs becoming the Mets&#x27; Triple-A affiliate beginning with the 2019 season. The team was rebranded as the Syracuse Mets, adopting the New York Mets&#x27; blue, orange, and white color scheme along with new logos and uniforms on October 16, 2018.

The Syracuse Mets started their 2019 inaugural season with one of the most experienced rosters in the minor leagues. Of the 25 players on the roster, 21 of them had previously played in the majors. They had combined for 7,006 total games. The Opening Day roster consisted of veteran outfielders Carlos Gómez and Rajai Davis, former Syracuse Chief Danny Espinosa, catcher René Rivera, and cult-star outfielder Tim Tebow. The Mets played their first game on April 4, against the Pawtucket Red Sox in front of an Opening Day home crowd of 8,823 fans. Syracuse took a 3–2 lead in the bottom of the sixth inning, but Pawtucket tied the game in the top of the eighth. The PawSox scored three more runs in the top of the tenth, defeating the home team, 6–3. The Mets&#x27; first win came in game one of a doubleheader on April 6 in which they defeated Pawtucket, 6–3 in 7 innings.
In that same first Mets win, with one out in the bottom of the fourth inning, Dilson Herrera hit the Syracuse Mets first home run.

On May 31, 2019, Travis Taijeron hit the first cycle in Syracuse Mets history in a 13–4 win over the PawSox. It was the first in franchise history since 1987. Rubén Tejada also hit for the cycle on June 19, 2019, against the Charlotte Knights. Despite his efforts, the Mets lost 9–7.

At the 2019 All-star break, the Mets were 42–47, good for 5th place in the IL North Division. After August 7, they made up 6.5 games in the standings to put themselves in a share of the division lead with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders after sweeping a doubleheader versus the Lehigh Valley IronPigs on August 26. They also had a winning season for the first time since 2014. Syracuse went into the final weekend of the 2019 season tied with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for the division lead. Both teams split both of their respective series&#x27; to stay tied for the division lead. The two teams played a one-game tie breaker in order to decide who would win the division, and ultimately make the playoffs. The Mets would lose the one-game tiebreaker by a score of 14–13. Syracuse had led 13–6 going into the bottom of the eighth inning, but Scranton/Wilkes-Barre would come back and score eight runs in the bottom half of the inning to eventually win the game, effectively eliminating the Mets from qualifying for the playoffs.

The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Mets were organized into the 20-team Triple-A East. The start of the season was pushed back to May.

Aside from winning on 2021 Opening Day, the Mets got off to a slow start, ending the month of May with an 8–16 record. The struggles continued in the month of June, where they endured a 15-game losing streak from June 6 to June 24. The 2021 regular season will be followed by the Triple-A Final Stretch, a 10-game tournament among all 30 Triple-A clubs, wherein the team with the best winning percentage over that stretch will receive a prize from Major League Baseball.

On August 29, 2021, the Syracuse Mets tied with the Rochester Red Wings to finish a game for the first time in franchise history. With the game tied at 3 in the bottom of the 7th inning, a 40-minute rain delay was in place before the game was called due to the rain. The game was ruled as a tie because the two teams would not play each other again that season.

In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

== Roster ==
== Corporate structure ==

=== New York Mets ===
In October 2017, the New York Mets, headed by then-Mets owner Jeff Wilpon, agreed to purchase the Chiefs for approximately $18 million pending approval by team shareholders. A vote was held on November 17, 2017, in which 88 percent of shareholders voted in favor of selling the team, thus meeting the required two-thirds vote needed for approval. The Mets organization assumed ownership in early 2018.

=== Community Baseball Club, Inc. ===
Prior to the Mets&#x27; purchase, the franchise was owned by the Community Baseball Club of Central New York, Inc., &quot;a community-owned club, controlled by a [13-person] board of directors,&quot; acting on behalf of approximately 4,000 shareholders, who together held 15,857 shares from 1961 to 2017.

According to Dick Ryan, a former club chairman of the board and treasurer, a majority of the Community Baseball Club shares were &quot;owned by people who own one or two shares.&quot; Shares in the club were first sold in 1961, at a price of $10 each; as of 2011, shares had a resale value of approximately $126, but were not publicly traded. A provision in the Chief&#x27;s certificate of corporation stated that &quot;no one may vote more than 500 shares.&quot; This provision was intended to make it difficult for the club to be sold and moved to another location, as happened earlier in its history.

==== Management ====
Officers of the Community Baseball Club of Central New York, Inc., included:

* Robert F. Julian, Chairman of the Board
* William Dutch, President
* Jason Smorol, General Manager

Among those serving on the organization&#x27;s Board of Directors were Stephen A. Rogers, Chairman, Syracuse Media Group; and Crandall Melvin III, &quot;a software executive from Syracuse and the team&#x27;s largest single shareholder with 502 shares.&quot;

Dutch was a partner in Chiefs First LLC, an investment company established in September 2013, which loaned the Chiefs $500,000 in return for 600 shares and controlled the team&#x27;s 13-member board.

==== Finances ====
The Chiefs operated at a loss from 2006, except for the 2010 season when they ended the season $100,000 in the black. The team lost $973,516 in the 2013 season, on operating expenses of $3.1 million. Under general manager Jason Smorol, their losses were reduced to $241,584 in 2014, and $169,011 in 2015.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cancelled 2020 Minor League Baseball season, and the delayed start to the 2021 Minor League Baseball season, the Syracuse Mets lost about $5 million, according to general manager Jason Smorol.

===Retired numbers and recognized people===

== Game broadcasts ==
Locally games are broadcast on the Mets&#x27; flagship radio station, WSKO &quot;The Score&quot; 1260 AM, and globally online via SyracuseMets.com. In addition, all games are broadcast on MiLB.TV, an internet video subscription service. Select games were broadcast live on Spectrum Sports, provided on Spectrum Cable services throughout the Central and Northern New York area until Spectrum ceased operations of its sports channels in the state sometime around 2017. The games on Spectrum Sports were called by Steve Grilli, Syracuse Wall of Fame member and former major leaguer. All games against thruway rivals Rochester or Buffalo were broadcast on Spectrum Sports and fed between the cities, with the host city providing the presentation and announcers.

==In popular culture==

Writer Ken Levine based the Springfield Isotopes minor league team in The Simpsons episode Dancin&#x27; Homer on experiences as an announcer for the Syracuse Chiefs. The episode includes references to former announcer Dan Hoard and owner Anthony &quot;Tex&quot; Simone (named Antoine &quot;Tex&quot; O&#x27;Hara in the episode).

The Chiefs gained national media attention for a promotion planned for 2014&#x27;s Tattoo Appreciation Night, where anyone who got a tattoo of their &quot;C&quot; logo would receive free tickets to Chiefs games for life.

<doc id="671174" wikidata="Q256076" url="?curid=671174" title="Cunedagius">
<text>Cunedagius (Latinized form; ) was a legendary king of the Britons, as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He came to power in 850BC.

He was the son of Henwin, Duke of Cornwall, and Regan, the daughter of King Leir.

Cunedagius, grandson of Leir, despised the rule of his aunt Cordelia. With the help of his cousin Marganus, Cunedagius took over the kingdom from Cordelia and ruled half of it. Following Cordelia&#x27;s Suicide, Cunedagius came to rule the region of Britain southwest of the Humber.

Two years after they split the island, Marganus invaded Cornwall and destroyed much of the land. Cunedagius met him in battle and defeated him. Marganus fled throughout Britain until he was cornered in Wales. Cunedagius killed him and became king of all of Britain. He ruled all of Britain for 33 years and was succeeded by his son Rivallo.

Geoffrey synchronizes Cunedagius&#x27; reign with the ministry of the Jewish prophet Isaiah and the founding of Rome by Romulus and Remus. Both events are dated to the 8th century BC.

==Later tradition==
Cunedagius and Marganus&#x27; conflict is mentioned twice in Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville&#x27;s play &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561), as a warning against the possibility of civil strife: &quot;Morgan slaine did yeld his conquered parte unto his cosins sworde in Camberland&quot; (Act I, Scene II); &quot;the cruell sworde bereft Morgan his life with cosyns hand&quot; (Act III, Scene I).

He was the son of King Cunedagius and was noted as a young king who reigned with moderation. Geoffrey describes him as a &quot;peaceful and fortunate youth, who ruled the kingdom well&quot;.

His reign was troubled by natural disasters: a rain of blood that lasted three days, a devastating plague, and a great swarm of flies. He was succeeded by his son Gurgustius.

<text>Gurgustius () was a legendary king of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He came to power in 788BC.

He was the son of King Rivallo and was succeeded by Sisillius I, and then Jago, who was Gurgustius&#x27; nephew. Geoffrey has nothing to say of him beyond this.

The &quot;Book of Baglan&quot; (1600–1607) gives Gurgustius&#x27; name as Gorwst, and states that his second son, Antonius, was Duke of Cornwall.

<text>Sisillius I (&quot;Welsh:&quot; Seisyll) was a legendary king of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He came to power in 753 BC.

He was preceded by Gurgustius and succeeded by Jago. He was the father of Kimarcus, king of the Britons, and shares his name with one of the sons of Ebraucus, and two later kings of the same name (Sisillius II and Sisillius III). Geoffrey has nothing to say of him beyond this.

<text>Gorboduc (&quot;Welsh:&quot; Gorwy or Goronwy) was a legendary king of the Britons as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He was married to Judon. When he became old, his sons, Ferrex and Porrex, feuded over who would take over the kingdom. Porrex tried to kill his brother in an ambush, but Ferrex escaped to France. With the French king Suhardus, he invaded Britain, but was defeated and killed by Porrex. Porrex was killed in revenge by his own mother Judon, then the high strata of society killed his mother and then there was a war between high strata and low strata leading to an anarchy in the society. This anarchy led to civil war denouncing Gorboduc. Geoffrey does not state when Gorbuduc died, but he is not mentioned after the account of the strife between his sons.

==Cultural references==
Gorboduc&#x27;s life is the subject of the 1561 play &quot;Gorboduc&quot;, which is historically important for being the model for later Elizabethan drama, for example, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedie of King Lear&quot; and &quot;The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus&quot;. It is the first play written throughout in blank verse. The story, like that of his ancestor King Lear, was used by Elizabethans as a warning of the dangers of civil discord.

&quot;A niece of King Gorboduc&quot; is mentioned briefly by the Fool in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

&quot;Gorboduc&quot; is the name of a poem by John Ashbery that appears in the collection &quot;April Galleons&quot; (1987).
