<text>Dirty Dancing is a 1987 American romantic drama dance film written by Eleanor Bergstein, produced by Linda Gottlieb, and directed by Emile Ardolino. Starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it tells the story of Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (Grey), a young woman who falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Swayze) at a vacation resort.

The film was based on screenwriter Bergstein&#x27;s own childhood. She originally wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn&quot;, but she ultimately ended up conceiving a story for a film which became &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;. She finished the script in 1985, but management changes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer put the film in development hell. The production company was changed to Vestron Pictures with Emile Ardolino as director and Linda Gottlieb as producer. Filming took place in Lake Lure, North Carolina, and Mountain Lake, Virginia, with the film&#x27;s score composed by John Morris and dance choreography by Kenny Ortega.

&quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 1987 and was released on August 21 in the United States, earning over $214 million worldwide—$64 million in the US and Canada and $150 million in other territories. It earned positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised the performances of Grey and Swayze, and its soundtrack, created by Jimmy Ienner, generated two multi-platinum albums and multiple singles. &quot;(I&#x27;ve Had) The Time of My Life&quot;, performed by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film&#x27;s popularity successfully launched its titular franchise, including a 1988 television series, multiple reality competition shows, a 2004 prequel titled &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot;, a stage production which has had sellout performances in multiple countries, a made-for-television musical adaptation in 2017, and an untitled sequel scheduled to be released in 2025, with Grey reprising her role.

==Plot==

In the summer of 1963, teenager Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman is vacationing with her family—cardiologist father Jake, mother Marge and older sister Lisa—at Kellerman&#x27;s, an upscale Catskills resort in the Borscht Belt owned by Jake&#x27;s sarcastic best friend Max. Exploring one night, Baby secretly observes Max instructing the waiters, all Ivy League students, to romance the guests&#x27; daughters, no matter how unattractive. Max also demeans the working-class entertainment staff, including Johnny Castle, one of the dance instructors. Baby is attracted to Johnny and dances briefly with him after his kindhearted cousin, Billy, introduces them at a secret &quot;dirty dancing&quot; party for resort staff. Max&#x27;s grandson Neil flirts with Baby in the meantime.

Baby learns Johnny&#x27;s dance partner Penny is pregnant by Robbie, a waiter and womanizer who attends the Yale School of Medicine and now has his eye on Lisa. When Robbie refuses to help Penny, Baby borrows money from her father, without explaining why, to pay for Penny&#x27;s abortion. At first, Penny declines as it would cause her and Johnny to miss a performance at a nearby resort, costing them the season&#x27;s salary, but Baby volunteers to stand in for Penny. During her dance sessions with Johnny, they develop a mutual attraction, and despite their failure to execute a climactic lift, Johnny and Baby&#x27;s performance is successful.

Back at Kellerman&#x27;s, Penny is badly injured by the botched abortion, and Baby enlists her father&#x27;s help to stabilize Penny. Angered by Baby&#x27;s deception, and assuming Johnny got Penny pregnant, Dr. Houseman commands Baby to stay away from them. Baby sneaks off to apologize to Johnny for her father&#x27;s treatment, but Johnny feels he deserves it due to his lower status; Baby reassures him of his worth, declaring her love. They begin secretly seeing each other, and her father refuses to talk to her.

Johnny rejects an indecent proposal by Vivian Pressman, an adulterous wife, who instead sleeps with Robbie, inadvertently foiling Lisa&#x27;s plan to lose her virginity to him. When Vivian spots Baby leaving Johnny&#x27;s cabin, she feels spurned and attempts revenge on Johnny by claiming he stole her husband&#x27;s wallet. Max is ready to fire Johnny, but Baby backs up his alibi, revealing she was with Johnny the night of the theft. The real thieves, Sydney and Sylvia Schumacher, are caught, but Johnny is still fired for mixing with Baby. Before leaving, Johnny tries to talk to Dr. Houseman but is accused of only trying to get at Baby. Baby later apologizes to her father for lying, but not for her romance with Johnny, and then accuses him of classism.

At the end-of-season talent show, Dr. Houseman gives Robbie a recommendation letter for medical school, but when Robbie admits that he got Penny pregnant, and then insults her and Baby, Dr. Houseman angrily grabs the letter back. Johnny arrives and disrupts the final song by bringing Baby up on stage and declaring that she has made him a better person, and then they perform the dance they practiced all summer, ending with a successful climactic lift. Dr. Houseman admits he was wrong about Johnny and reconciles with Baby, and all the staff and guests join Baby and Johnny dancing to &quot;(I&#x27;ve Had) The Time of My Life&quot;.

==Cast==

&quot;Cousin Brucie&quot; Morrow appears in a cameo as a magician; Morrow himself could be heard as a DJ&#x27;s voice in different parts of the film. Emile Ardolino and Matthew Broderick (who was dating Grey at the time and co-starred with her in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;) have cameos.

==Production==

===Pre-production===
&quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; is based in large part on screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein&#x27;s own childhood: she is the younger daughter of a Jewish doctor from New York and had spent summers with her family in the Catskills where she participated in &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; competitions; she was also nicknamed &quot;Baby&quot; herself as a girl. In 1980, Bergstein wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn&quot;; however, the producers cut an erotic dancing scene from the script, prompting her to conceive a new story that took inspiration from her youth dance competitions. In 1984, she pitched the idea to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) executive Eileen Miselle, who liked it and teamed Bergstein with producer Linda Gottlieb. They set the film in 1963, with the character of Baby based on Bergstein&#x27;s own life and the character of Johnny based on the stories of Michael Terrace, a dance instructor whom Bergstein met in the Catskills in 1985 while she was researching the story. She finished the script in November 1985, but management changes at MGM put the script into turnaround, or limbo.

Bergstein gave the script to other studios but was repeatedly rejected until she brought it to Vestron Pictures. While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb had agreed to cut the proposed budget in half. Bergstein and Gottlieb then chose Emile Ardolino as the film&#x27;s director; Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project after reading the script while he was on jury duty. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron&#x27;s president, Jon Peisinger, and the company&#x27;s vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlit the project to become Vestron&#x27;s first feature film production. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5 million, at a time when the average cost for a film was $12 million.

For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who had been trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find anything suitable in the Catskills (as many of the Borscht Belt resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided on a combination of two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina, and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Pembroke, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was done in the same area.

===Casting===
Director Ardolino was adamant that they choose dancers, such as Swayze, who could also act, as he did not want to use the &quot;stand-in&quot; method that had been used with &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983).

For the female lead of Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman, Winona Ryder, Sarah Jessica Parker and Sharon Stone were considered. Bergstein chose the 26-year-old Jennifer Grey, daughter of the Oscar-winning actor and dancer Joel Grey (&quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972)). Grey was paid $50,000 () for her role. The producers then sought a male lead, initially considering 20-year-old Billy Zane, though initial screen tests when he was partnered with Grey did not meet expectations. Val Kilmer and Benicio del Toro were also considered for Johnny. The next choice was 34-year-old Patrick Swayze, who appeared in &quot;Grandview, U.S.A.&quot; (1984) and had co-starred with Grey on &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984). He was a seasoned dancer, with experience from the Joffrey Ballet. The producers were thrilled with him, but his resume read &quot;No dancing&quot; after a knee injury. However, Swayze read the script, liked the multi-level character of Johnny, and took the part anyway. After this, Johnny&#x27;s heritage was changed from being Italian to Irish. Grey was initially not happy about the choice, as she and Swayze had difficulty getting along on &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, but when they did their dancing screen test, the chemistry between them was obvious. Bergstein described it as &quot;breathtaking&quot;. Other casting choices were Broadway actor Jerry Orbach as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby&#x27;s father; and Jane Brucker as Lisa Houseman, her older sister.

Bergstein, as the film&#x27;s writer, also attempted to cast her friend, sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer, to play Mrs. Schumacher (and Joel Grey as Dr. Ruth&#x27;s husband). However, Westheimer backed out when she learned the role involved her playing a thief. The role went instead to 89-year-old Paula Trueman.

Another role went to Bergstein&#x27;s friend, New York radio personality &quot;Cousin Brucie&quot; Morrow. She initially wanted him to portray the social director, but then later asked him to play the part of the magician. Morrow himself could be heard at different parts of the movie as a New York area DJ (at the time of the film&#x27;s setting he was working at WABC, a top 40 station), and served as period music consultant. The role of the social director went to the then-unknown Wayne Knight (later of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; fame).

The part of Baby&#x27;s mother was originally given to Lynne Lipton, who is briefly visible in the beginning, when the Houseman family first pulls into Kellerman&#x27;s (she is in the front seat for a few seconds; her blonde hair is the only indication), but she became ill during the first week of shooting and was replaced by actress Kelly Bishop, who had already been cast to play resort guest Vivian Pressman. Bishop moved into the role of Mrs. Houseman, and the film&#x27;s assistant choreographer Miranda Garrison took on the role of Vivian. (When Baby is dancing in the final scene, the line that her mother says to Jerry Orbach, &quot;She gets that from me ...&quot; is a wink to the fact that Kelly Bishop was in the original cast of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; winning a 1976 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance, using the name at that time of Carole Bishop, and had been a professional dancer.)

===Filming===

Principal photography for &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; took place in Lake Lure, North Carolina, and Mountain Lake, Virginia. Scenes in Lake Lure were filmed at a former Boy Scout Camp called Camp Chimney Rock, which is now a private, residential community known as Firefly Cove where only the stone steps where Baby practiced still exist. These scenes included the interior dancing scenes, Baby carrying the watermelon and practicing on the signature stairs, Johnny&#x27;s cabin, the staff cabins and the dances on a log. The final dance scene was filmed at the camp gymnasium, which no longer stands. The golf scene where Baby asks her father for $250 was filmed at Rumbling Bald Golf Course. Scenes filmed at Mountain Lake included dining scenes, Kellerman&#x27;s Hotel, the beach games, the Houseman family&#x27;s cabins, the water lift scene and Penny crying in the kitchen.

Filming started for &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; on September 5, 1986, and lasted just 43 days. The production had to battle bad weather, including outside temperatures of . With the camera and lighting equipment needed for filming, the temperature inside could be as high as . According to choreographer Kenny Ortega, 10 people passed out within 25 minutes of shooting one day. Paula Trueman collapsed and was taken to the local emergency room to be treated for dehydration. Patrick Swayze also required a hospital visit; insisting on doing his own stunts, he repeatedly fell off the log during the &quot;balancing&quot; scene and injured his knee so badly he had to have fluid drained from the swelling.

Delays in the shooting schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required the set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The weather became cold, causing the lake&#x27;s temperatures to drop to near for the famous swimming scene, which was filmed in October. Despite her character&#x27;s enjoyment, Grey later described the water as &quot;horrifically&quot; cold, and she might not have gone into the lake, except that she was &quot;young and hungry&quot;.

Relations between the two main stars varied throughout production. They had already had trouble getting along in their previous project, &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), and worked things out enough to have an extremely positive screen test, but that initial cooperation soon faded, and they were soon &quot;facing off&quot; before every scene. To address this, producer Bergstein and director Ardolino forced the stars to re-watch their initial screen-tests—the ones with the &quot;breathtaking&quot; chemistry. This had the desired effect, and Swayze and Grey were able to return to the film with renewed energy and enthusiasm.

Some of the scenes in the film are improvised. For example, the scene where Grey was to stand in front of Swayze with her back to him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm. Grey was exhausted at the time and found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, and he became annoyed. The footage was found in the editing room and the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey&#x27;s giggling and Swayze&#x27;s annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, &quot;as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film.&quot; Grey has stated that the final climactic lift was never rehearsed and only ever done on the day the scene was shot.

===Post-production===
The shooting wrapped on October 27, 1986, both on-time and on-budget. No one on the team, however, liked the rough cut that was put together, and Vestron executives were convinced the film was going to be a flop. In May 1987, the film was screened for producer Aaron Russo. According to Vestron executive Mitchell Cannold, Russo&#x27;s reaction at the end was to say simply, &quot;Burn the negative, and collect the insurance.&quot;

Further disputes arose over whether a corporate sponsor could be found to promote the film. Marketers of the Clearasil acne product liked the film, seeing it as a vehicle to reach a teen target audience. However, when they learned the film contained an abortion scene, they asked for that part of the plot to be cut. As Bergstein refused, the Clearasil promotion was dropped. Consequently, Vestron promoted the film themselves and initially aimed for a July premiere before setting the premiere on August 16, 1987. The Vestron executives had planned to release the film in theaters for a weekend, and then home video, since Vestron had been in the video distribution business before film production.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 72% based on reviews from 74 critics and a rating average of 6.30/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Like its winsome characters, &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; uses impressive choreography and the power of song to surmount a series of formidable obstacles.&quot; Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963— orderly, prosperous, bursting with good intentions, a sort of Yiddish-inflected Camelot.&quot; Other reviews were more mixed: Gene Siskel gave the film a &quot;marginal Thumbs Up&quot; as he liked Jennifer Grey&#x27;s acting and development of her character, while Roger Ebert gave it &quot;Thumbs Down&quot; due to its &quot;idiot plot&quot;, calling it a &quot;tired and relentlessly predictable story of love between kids from different backgrounds.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine was lukewarm, saying, &quot;If the ending of Eleanor Bergstein&#x27;s script is too neat and inspirational, the rough energy of the film&#x27;s song and dance does carry one along, past the whispered doubts of better judgment.&quot; In a retrospective review, &quot;Jezebel&quot;″s Irin Carmon called the film &quot;the greatest movie of all time&quot; as &quot;a great, brave movie for women&quot; with &quot;some subtle, retrospectively sharp-eyed critiques of class and gender.&quot;

Abortion rights advocates have called the film the &quot;gold standard&quot; for cinematic portrayals of abortion, which author Yannis Tzioumakis described as offering a &quot;compassionate depiction of abortion in which the woman seeking an abortion was not demonized with the primary concerns being her health and preserving her capacity to bear children at a future time rather than the ethical dilemma that might or might not inform her decision, a portrayal that is not necessarily available in current films.&quot;

The film drew adult audiences instead of the expected teens, with viewers rating the film highly. Many filmgoers, after seeing the film once, went back into the theater to watch it a second time. Word-of-mouth promotion took the film to the number one position in the United States, and in 10 days it had broken the $10 million mark. By November, it was also achieving international fame. Within seven months of release, it had brought in $63 million in the US and boosted attendance in dance classes across America. It was one of the highest-grossing films of 1987, earning $170 million worldwide.

The film&#x27;s popularity continued to grow after its initial release. It was the number one video rental of 1988 and became the first film to sell a million copies on video. When the film was re-released in 1997, ten years after its original release, Swayze received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and videos were still selling at the rate of over 40,000 per month. , it was selling a million DVDs per year, with over ten million copies sold .

A May 2007 survey by Britain&#x27;s Sky Movies listed &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; as number one on &quot;Women&#x27;s most-watched films&quot;, above the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. The film&#x27;s popularity has also caused it to be called &quot;the &quot;Star Wars&quot; for girls.&quot;

The film&#x27;s music has also had considerable impact. The closing song, &quot;(I&#x27;ve Had) The Time of My Life&quot;, has been listed as the &quot;third most popular song played at funerals&quot; in the UK.

In October 2021, amid a dispute over abortion in Texas, magazine &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; recommended the film as one to revisit on abortion in the cinema industry. Angie Han, writing for the magazine, highlighted Eleanor Bergstein&#x27;s writing of the film.

==Music==

Rehearsals for the dancing, and some filming, used music from Bergstein&#x27;s personal collection of gramophone records. When it came time to select actual music for the film, Vestron chose Jimmy Ienner as music supervisor. Ienner, who had previously produced albums and songs for John Lennon and Three Dog Night, opted to stick with much of the music that had already been used during filming and obtained licenses for the songs from Bergstein&#x27;s collection. He also enlisted Swayze to sing the new song &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot;. Swayze had written the song a few years earlier with Stacy Widelitz, originally intending for it to be used in the film &quot;Grandview, U.S.A.&quot; (1984).

John Morris composed the film&#x27;s score. The lyrics for the Kellermans&#x27; song that closes the talent show were written specifically for the film and were sung to the tune of &quot;Annie Lisle&quot;, a commonly used theme for school alma maters. Kenny Ortega and his assistant Miranda Garrison chose the song for the finale by going through an entire box of tapes, listening to each one. According to Ortega, literally the last tape they listened to had &quot;The Time of My Life&quot;, which they saw as the obvious choice. Ienner then insisted that Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes record it. The song won the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group, an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack started an oldies music revival, and demand for the album caught RCA Records by surprise. The &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; album spent 18 weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album sales charts and went platinum 14 times, selling more than 32 million copies worldwide. It spawned a follow-up multi-platinum album in February 1988, entitled &quot;More Dirty Dancing&quot;.

Songs from the album that appeared on the charts included:
* &quot;(I&#x27;ve Had) The Time of My Life,&quot; performed by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, composed by Franke Previte, John deNicola, and Donald Markowitz – this song rose to No. 1 on the pop charts.
* &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind,&quot; performed by lead actor Patrick Swayze, composed by Swayze and Stacy Widelitz; this song peaked at No. 3 in 1988.
* &quot;Hungry Eyes,&quot; performed by Eric Carmen, composed by Franke Previte and John deNicola; this song peaked at No. 4 in 1988.
* &quot;Yes,&quot; performed by Merry Clayton, composed by Neal Cavanaugh, Terry Fryer, and Tom Graf; this song peaked No. 45 in 1988.

The &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; album held the number one spot on the Billboard album chart for over four months. As of July 2022, the &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; album has sold over 14 million copies. Additionally, the resurgence in popularity of the oldies contained in the movie led to a re-release of The Contours&#x27; single &quot;Do You Love Me.&quot; &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; was featured in the movie but was omitted from the original soundtrack; it was included on &quot;More Dirty Dancing&quot;. Upon being re-released, &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; became a surprise hit all over again, this time peaking at No. 11 (it originally hit No. 3 back in 1962).

==Legacy==
In Sweden, feminist art group Sisters of Jam put the text &quot;Nobody puts Baby in a corner&quot; (in English) in white neon light at Umeå Bus Square (2008) and at Karlstad University (2012).

The resort where &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; was filmed has had themed weekend activities, such as dance lessons, guided tours, film screenings, parties, and lawn games. Lionsgate, however, stopped the Dirty Dancing festival in 2023, so a Lake Lure Dance Festival is held instead, though festival organizers say they still remember the movie. The wood floor from the final dance scene was salvaged and used in Esmeralda Inn and Restaurant.

The film is screened annually for incoming first-years at Mount Holyoke College, specifically for the line &quot;Baby&#x27;s starting Mount Holyoke in the fall.&quot;

In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

===Prequel===
In 2004, a prequel film was released, entitled &quot;Havana Nights&quot;. Starring Romola Garai and Diego Luna, the plot follows a sheltered American teenager learning about life through dance, when her family relocates to Havana, Cuba just before the 1959 Cuban Revolution. Swayze was paid $5 million to appear in a cameo role as a dance teacher. The film was a minor box office success but received mostly negative reviews from critics.

===Stage adaptation===

The film was adapted for the stage in 2004 as a musical, &quot;Dirty Dancing: The Classic Story on Stage&quot;. Produced by Jacobsen Entertainment in Australia for $6.5 million, it was written by Eleanor Bergstein and had the same songs as the film, plus a few extra scenes. Musical direction was by Chong Lim (one of the composers for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney), and the initial production starred Kym Valentine as Baby and Sydney Dance Company&#x27;s Josef Brown as Johnny. Although reviews were mixed, the production was a commercial success, selling over 200,000 tickets during its six-month run. It has also had sellout runs in Germany and in London&#x27;s West End, where it opened at the Aldwych Theatre on October 23, 2006, with the highest pre-sell in London history, earning £6 million (US$12 million). , over 1 million people have seen the musical in London, selling out 6 months in advance. The original West End production closed in July 2011 after a five-year run, prior to a two-year national tour. The show returned to the West End at the Piccadilly Theatre and ran from July 13, 2013, to February 22, 2014, before resuming its tour of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

===20th anniversary releases===
For the 20th anniversary in 2007, the film was re-released in theaters with additional footage, while the original film was reissued on DVD with deleted scenes, and included writer commentary. At the same time, Codemasters released &quot;Dirty Dancing: The Video Game&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the anniversary was marked by a reality TV show based on the film; titled &quot;Dirty Dancing: The Time of Your Life&quot;, which was filmed at the Mountain Lake resort.

In the UK, to mark the 20th anniversary, Channel Five broadcast a special documentary called &quot;Seriously Dirty Dancing&quot;. Presented by Dawn Porter, an investigative journalist and a self-confessed &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; addict, it was very successful, being Channel Five&#x27;s highest rated documentary of 2007. Porter visited the film set, met other fanatics, and learned the last dance, which she performs at the end in front of family and friends.

===Remake===

In August 2011, Lionsgate announced their plan to produce a remake, and confirmed that the original film&#x27;s choreographer, Kenny Ortega, was attached to direct. &quot;We believe that the timing couldn&#x27;t be better to modernize this story on the big screen, and we are proud to have Kenny Ortega at the helm&quot;, Joe Drake, president of Lionsgate&#x27;s Motion Picture Group, explained about the project. A miniseries version of &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; had been scheduled to be shot in Western North Carolina. , the miniseries has been put on hold.

In December 2015, ABC ordered a three-hour musical remake of &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, starring Abigail Breslin, Colt Prattes, Debra Messing, Sarah Hyland, Nicole Scherzinger, Billy Dee Williams and Shane Harper. It aired on May 24, 2017. It received largely negative reviews.

===Sequel===
Plans for a &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; sequel were first discussed by Vestron in 1988. In 2020, a sequel was announced with Grey attached to reprise her role as Baby. As part of their presentation during CinemaCon 2022, current rights owner Lionsgate announced the film had the tentative title of &quot;DD&quot; and reaffirmed that Grey would still reprise her role as Baby. On May 9, 2022, it was announced that the film was eyeing a February 2024 release date, with Jonathan Levine announced to direct.

<doc id="680370" wikidata="Q309005" url="?curid=680370" title="Portuguese Football Federation">
<text>The Portuguese Football Federation ( , FPF) is the governing body of football in Portugal. The federation was formed in 1914 as Portuguese Football Union (, UPF) by the three existing regional associations of Lisbon, Portalegre and Porto, before adopting its current name in 1926, and has its headquarters in City of Football in the city of Oeiras. The (FPF) joined FIFA in 1923 and is also a founding member of UEFA.

The Portuguese Federation oversees all aspects of the game of football in Portugal, both professional, amateur and administers the competition committee (including the handling of the trophy) of the Campeonato de Portugal, the Taça de Portugal and the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. It is also responsible for appointing the management of the Portugal national football team (men&#x27;s), women&#x27;s, and youth national football teams. The men and women&#x27;s Portugal national futsal team and Portugal national beach soccer team are also organized by the federation.

==History==
===Early days and formation===

Founded on 31 March 1914 by the three then existing regional associations - Lisbon, Portalegre and Porto - the Portuguese Football Union was the predecessor of the Portuguese Football Federation, which won its name at the Extraordinary Congress of 28 May 1926. The first statues had been previously published on 12 January 1914, after a public notice that had been published to inform the formation of the new body.

In the early years of its existence, the UPF merely organized a number of meetings between the Lisbon and Porto teams, as well as presenting Portugal&#x27;s bid for FIFA, which was accepted at the XII FIFA Congress, organized in Geneva, in May 1923, in which Portugal became a full member. Until that date, the UPF had been governed by the 1914 statutes, drafted by the first leaders of the new body, including Luís Nunes, who had had a leading role in the creation of the Lisbon Football Association in 1910. These statutes were the main lines of Portuguese football until 1938.

Portugal&#x27;s first championship the Campeonato de Portugal (a knock-out tournament, precursor of the Taça de Portugal) was only realized in 1921, after several postponements due to the First World War, which delayed the start of several competitions, in the process limited the matches between Lisbon and Porto teams and regional championships in those cities.

This denomination was assumed by deliberation at the Congress of 28 May 1926, but for the amendment to be legal it was necessary to reform the statutes, which would only come into effect from 3 December 1938 and in the process the federation was renamed to Portuguese Football Federation, with João Luís de Moura being elected the first president of the federation. In 1954, Portugal became one of the founding member of UEFA in Basel, Switzerland. On 9 April 1956, the federation received the Commander of the Order of Goodwill. During this time, the FPF changed their headquarters seven times, and in 1968 the federation finally settled their headquarters at Praça da Alegria, nº 25.

===Silva Resende&#x27;s term, Saltillo Affair and Gilberto Madaíl term===
In 1986, Silva Resende was elected president of the federation. During his term in June 1986, the FPF was involved is a series of controversies surrounding the Portugal national football team during its participation in the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. The team had not competed in a final phase of the World Cup since the 1966 FIFA World Cup twenty years before, where it had achieved an unprecedented 3rd place. Following a rough qualification, the 1986 campaign did not start well with the suspicion of doping falling on one of the players who had been selected for the tournament. Although that test was later proven wrong, that was the first of many controversies to affect the team in the following weeks, that included threats of strikes from the players, the announcement of a series of demands to the Portuguese Federation and reports of inappropriate behavior at the team&#x27;s headquarters. The international press tagged the incident as &quot;ridiculous&quot;, but still took sides with the players due to the situations described by the players, which included being forced to advertise certain products (Adidas and a local brand of beer) without being paid. Despite the incident during the World Cup, Resende retained is position until 1989, when João Rodrigues was elected the new president.

In 1996, Gilberto Madaíl was elected as the 30th president of the Portuguese federation, notwithstanding the voices that demanded the imperative need for a reformulation of the federation, which included in its leaders various personalities who had held the office since the time of the Saltillo Affair. On 12 October 1999, in Aachen, Germany, Portugal was announced as hosts for UEFA Euro 2004, beating Spain and the joint bid of Austria and Hungary. On 5 July 2004, the FPF was made an Honorary Member of the Order of Infante D. Henrique. In 12 October 2004, FPF changed their headquarters for the eight time to a building in Alexandre Herculano avenue, which currently resides today.

===Recent days and Fernando Gomes term===
In 2010, after Portugal was eliminated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup and Carlos Queiroz was sacked by the Portuguese Football Federation on 9 September, Madaíl decided to hold elections for the FPF, in which Fernando Gomes was elected as the new and 31st president of the federation on 10 December 2011. On 13 December 2018, FPF appealed to proceed with the integration of the Primeira Liga as soon as possible. On 3 December 2018 in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, Portugal was announced the host country of the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals by the UEFA Executive Committee. On 8 October 2020, Fernando Gomes and his Spanish counterpart Luis Rubiales confirmed that the two countries would be putting forward a joint bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. On 4 October 2023, the FIFA Executive Committee has unanimously accepted the Portugal-Spain-Morocco (who later joined the Iberian bid) as the sole candidate to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup.

<text>Albert Charles Blozis (January 5, 1919 – January 31, 1945) was an American professional football player and track and field athlete who died fighting in World War II. He played offensive tackle for the New York Giants in the National Football League (NFL)

==Biography==

===Early life===
Albert Charles Blozis, known as &quot;Al&quot;, was born on January 5, 1919, in Garfield, New Jersey to Lithuanian immigrants. He attended William L. Dickinson High School in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he became well known for his skill in the discus throw and shot put. At Georgetown University, he won AAU and NCAA indoor and outdoor shot titles three years in a row from 1940 to 1942. He had a best put of . In 2015, Blozis was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

===Professional football career===
Blozis was drafted in the fifth round of the 1942 NFL draft and played offensive tackle for the New York Giants of the National Football League in 1942 and 1943 before entering the military. He was also able to play three games in 1944 while on furlough.

===World War II and death===
In a 1991 news story, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Curiously, the very size that made him so intimidating on the football field kept him out of the military until late 1943, when, after repeated attempts, Blozis finally persuaded the Army to waive its size limit and accept him. It took further persuading to get from a desk job to the front lines.&quot;

Blozis was inducted into the United States Army on December 9, 1943. He was first assigned to duty as a physical instructor at Walter Reed General Hospital and then went through officer training at Fort Benning, where he set the army&#x27;s hand-grenade-throwing record with a toss of 94 yards, 2 feet, 6.5 inches. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 28th Infantry Division. On January 31, 1945, his platoon was in the Vosges Mountains of France scouting enemy lines. When two of his men, a sergeant and a private, failed to return from a patrol, he went in search of them alone. He never returned.

Blozis was first listed as missing, but in April 1945, his death was confirmed.

===Honors===
The New York Giants retired the number 32 that Blozis had worn. A second Giants player, Jack Lummus, also died in World War II.

In April 1946, &quot;True Comics&quot; featured a story about Blozis entitled &quot;The Human Howitzer&quot;.

The United States Army honored Blozis by naming an athletic center in Frankfurt, Germany after him. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986.

An apartment building in Jersey City, Al Blozis Hall, is named in his honor.

<text>Carla Bonner (born 3 March 1973) is an Australian actress, best known for playing the role of Stephanie Scully in the Australian soap opera drama &quot;Neighbours&quot;, a role she played from 1999 to 2010. She was also a guest on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother Australia&quot; in 2002. Following her departure from &quot;Neighbours&quot;, Bonner wrote a book called &quot;Hook, Line and Sink Her&quot; and guest starred in an episode of &quot;Wentworth&quot;. She briefly reprised the role of Steph in 2013, before returning to &quot;Neighbours&quot; as a permanent cast member from October 2015 until June 2018. She briefly reprised the role in July 2022.

==Career==
Bonner attended the Australian College of the Arts. Prior to landing her role on &quot;Neighbours&quot;, Bonner&#x27;s acting experience was confined to television commercials, corporate videos, and bit parts, including a guest role on &quot;Raw FM&quot;. When Emma Roche unexpectedly quit the role of Stephanie Scully in &quot;Neighbours&quot;, Bonner auditioned for the part and was immediately cast as Steph.

On 3 June 2010, it was announced that Bonner had quit &quot;Neighbours&quot; after eleven years. The character of Stephanie was not killed off, leaving the door open for a potential return. The show&#x27;s executive producer, Susan Bower, said &quot;The storylines on-air and coming up showcase what an exceptional talent Carla is and while fans will be disappointed, I promise Steph&#x27;s farewell will be long remembered and will do the character proud.&quot;

In 2012, Bonner wrote and published a dating book for men called &quot;Hook, Line and Sink Her&quot;. That same year, it was announced that Bonner would be returning to &quot;Neighbours&quot; for two months. The actress began filming her scenes in January 2013 and she made her on-screen return as Steph on 15 April 2013. Bonner portrayed Manda Katsis in episode four of &quot;Wentworth&quot;. On 10 September 2013, it was announced that Bonner had teamed up with writer and producer Gary O&#x27;Toole to develop a 12-part television series based on &quot;Hook, Line and Sink Her&quot;.

Bonner appeared in the ABC3 teen drama &quot;Ready for This&quot; in 2015. In July of that year, it was announced Bonner had returned to &quot;Neighbours&quot; as Steph. She appeared on-screen from October. In May 2018, it was confirmed that Bonner had left the show. That same year, she filmed a role in the ABC Comedy series &quot;Superwog&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bonner lives in Perth, Western Australia. She has two sons Harley Bonner and Jhye. Harley joined the cast of &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 2013 as Josh Willis.

Bonner is good friends with Kym Valentine, who played Libby Kennedy in &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Bonner&#x27;s character and Valentine&#x27;s character were also best friends.

In 2007 Bonner was involved in a car accident and was charged with &quot;unlicensed driving&quot; amongst other offences. She was convicted and fined $1,000.

<doc id="680375" wikidata="Q862383" url="?curid=680375" title="Bill Plympton">
<text>Bill Plympton (born April 30, 1946) is an American animator, graphic designer, cartoonist, and filmmaker best known for his 1987 Academy Award–nominated animated short &quot;Your Face&quot; and his series of shorts featuring a dog character starting with 2004&#x27;s &quot;Guard Dog&quot;.

==Early life==
Plympton was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Wilda Jean (Jerman) and Donald F. Plympton, and was raised on a farm in nearby Oregon City with five siblings. From 1964 to 1968, he studied Graphic Design at Portland State University, where he was a member of the film society and worked on the yearbook. In 1968, he transferred to the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he majored in cartooning. He graduated from SVA in 1969.

==Career==
Plympton&#x27;s illustrations and cartoons have been published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the weekly newspaper &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, as well as in the magazines &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. His political cartoon strip &quot;Plympton&quot;, which began in 1975 in the &quot;SoHo Weekly News&quot;, eventually was syndicated and appeared in over 20 newspapers.

In 1988, his animated short &quot;Your Face&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. He also became known for other animated short films, including &quot;25 Ways to Quit Smoking&quot; (1989) and &quot;Enemies&quot; (1991), the latter of which was part of the &quot;Animania&quot; series on MTV, where many of his other shorts were shown. 

In 1991, Plympton won the Prix Spécial du Jury at the Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Push Comes to Shove&quot; which was featured on MTV&#x27;s animated series &quot;Liquid Television&quot;. In 1992, his self-financed, first feature-length animated film, &quot;The Tune&quot; debuted at the Sundance Film Festival.
His work also appeared on the 1992–1993 Fox comedy series &quot;The Edge&quot;. In 1993, he made his first live action film, &quot;J. Lyle&quot;.

In 1995, he contributed animation and graphics to a computer game collection, &quot;Take Your Best Shot&quot;. He also published a comic book in 2003, &quot;The Sleazy Cartoons of Bill Plympton&quot;. 

The actress Martha Plimpton, a distant relative of his, served as associate producer on Plympton&#x27;s animated feature &quot;Hair High&quot; (2004), doing much of the casting. The movie&#x27;s voice cast included her father Keith Carradine and her uncle David Carradine.

==Later works==
&quot;Guard Dog&quot; (2004) was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. In 2005, Plympton animated a music video for Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Heard &#x27;Em Say&quot; and the following year, he created the music video for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Download This Song&quot;. Plympton contributed animation to the 2006 History Channel series &quot;10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America&quot;, to illustrate the events of Shays&#x27; Rebellion. Together with other independent New York City animators, he has released two DVDs of animated shorts, both titled &quot;Avoid Eye Contact&quot;.

Plympton&#x27;s 2008 80-minute feature, &quot;Idiots and Angels&quot; presented by Terry Gilliam, had no dialogue. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on 26 April 2008,

In 2011, Alexia Anastasio completed a documentary on Plympton&#x27;s life, &quot;Adventures in Plymptoons!&quot;, released in September 2012 direct-to-DVD and on video-on-demand.

In 2011, Plympton collaborated with child film critic Perry Chen on &quot;Ingrid Pitt: Beyond the Forest&quot;, a 2011 short animated film directed by Kevin Sean Michaels, about actress and Holocaust survivor Ingrid Pitt.

Plympton animated the opening couch gag for the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes &quot;Beware My Cheating Bart&quot; in 2012, &quot;Black Eyed, Please&quot; in 2013, &quot;Married to the Blob&quot; in 2014, &quot;Lisa the Veterinarian&quot; in 2016, &quot;22 for 30&quot; in 2017, &quot;3 Scenes Plus a Tag from a Marriage&quot; in 2018, &quot;Manger Things&quot; in 2021 and &quot;One Angry Lisa&quot; in 2022; as well as the menus and packaging for the Season 19 DVD.

Plympton directed the segment &quot;On Eating and Drinking&quot; in the 2014 animated film &quot;The Prophet&quot;, adapted from Kahlil Gibran&#x27;s book &quot;The Prophet.&quot; In 2018, Plympton created a series of videos for &quot;The New York Times&quot; called “Trump Bites”. One of the series, &quot;Trump and Putin: A Love Story&quot;, depicts Trump and Putin kissing half-naked. Critics said the video implied that gay relationships were inherently comical and immoral.

In 2020, Plympton released a Kickstarter for his new animated comedy western, &quot;Slide&quot;. The funding was successful and Plympton had planned on finishing the film by 2022.

==Legacy==
A collection of more than 180 Plympton items is held at the Academy Film Archive. The archive has preserved Plympton&#x27;s films such as &quot;Your Face&quot;, &quot;The Tune&quot;, &quot;Guard Dog&quot;, and &quot;The Cow Who Wanted to Be a Hamburger&quot;.

His films have featured in the Animation Show of Shows including &quot;Your Face&quot;, &quot;Guard Dog&quot;, &quot;Eat&quot; (2001), &quot;The Fan and the Flower&quot; (2005), and &quot;Santa: The Fascist Years&quot; (2009).

==Personal life==
On December 23, 2011, Plympton married animator/artist/illustrator Sandrine Flament. Their son was born in September 2012.

==Influences==
Plympton has stated he has many influences, the biggest being the work of the Walt Disney studio with others including Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Robert Crumb, Milton Glaser, Charles Addams, Roland Topor, Quentin Tarantino, Frank Capra, Richard Lester, Bob Godfrey, Saul Steinberg, Tomi Ungerer, Jacques Tati, Milt Kahl, Carlos Nine, and Jules Feiffer. He said &quot;I Married a Strange Person!&quot; &quot;was influenced by Peter Jackson, some of his earlier films ... where he used gore and violence and blood as humor.&quot;

<doc id="680383" wikidata="Q620499" url="?curid=680383" title="Tokyo Verdy">
<text>is a Japanese professional football club based in Inagi, Tokyo. The club currently competes in the J1 League, following promotion from the J2 League in 2023.

== History ==

Founded as Yomiuri Football Club in 1969, Tokyo Verdy is one of the most decorated clubs in the J.League, with honours including 2 league titles, 5 Emperor&#x27;s Cups, 6 JSL Cup/J.League Cups and an Asian Club Championship title, and the most successful team in Japanese football history with 25 titles. The club was an original member of the J.League in 1993.

===Early years and rise to the top (1969–1983)===

In October 1968, following Japan&#x27;s bronze medal triumph at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City and the interest in football that ensued, Japan Football Association president Yuzuru Nozu visited Yomiuri Giants chairman Matsutaro Shoriki to ask him if Yomiuri was willing to ride on the wave of the game by establishing their own football club. Shoriki died a year later, in 1969, but not before signing his name to the plans to establish Yomiuri Football Club. Backed by the Yomiuri Group and NTV, Yomiuri Football Club firstly launched at Tokyo Local League B (5th tier) in 1969. They began gaining promotions from the Tokyo Local League to the Kanto Football League (3rd tier) in 1971. In 1971, Yomiuri marked 3rd place and promoted Japan Soccer League Second Division.

They were promoted to First Division in 1978, starting a long career of success in the top flight. Their first major title was the Japan Soccer League Cup in 1979.

=== Golden era (1983–1994) ===
From its days as Yomiuri FC, the ownership had visions of a football equivalent of the baseball team Yomiuri Giants – a star-studded powerhouse with fans across Japan. As Japanese football began its transition from the JSL to the J.League in the early 1990s, it invested heavily in stars and featured Japan internationals Kazuyoshi Miura, Ruy Ramos and Tsuyoshi Kitazawa.

The last two JSL championships as Yomiuri FC in 1990–91 and 1991–92, and then winning the first two championships as Verdy Kawasaki in 1993 and 1994, effectively winning four straight Japanese league titles making a total of seven overall; the highest in the Japanese system. Verdy also won the 1996 Emperor&#x27;s Cup and three consecutive J.League Cups from 1992 to 1994.

The JSL disbanded and reformed as the professional J.League in 1993. At this time the team professionalized and renamed itself &quot;Verdy Kawasaki&quot;, &quot;Coined from the Portuguese &quot;VERDE&quot; meaning &quot;green&quot; probably named after their green jersey colour &quot;Tokyo Greens/Tokyo Verdi&quot;, although the color was picked in homage to Brazilian club Palmeiras, a team admired by one of Yomiuri&#x27;s first idols, São Paulo-born George Yonashiro. Although &quot;Yomiuri&quot; was dropped from the name as the club spun off from the company, the team remained under Yomiuri&#x27;s ownership until 1997, when it was acquired by Nippon Television Network, the broadcast arm of the Yomiuri Group.

===Lack of success and support (1995–2000)===

This early success did not last, however, and as the stars aged, the team&#x27;s performance suffered. Verdy&#x27;s 1st-place finish in the 2nd stage of the 1995 season would be its last stage victory and the 1996 Emperor&#x27;s Cup would be its last major title of the decade. A downturn in the national economy and the cooling of the J.League fad meant all teams had to cut expenses. This meant Verdy could no longer buy expensive replacements for its aging stars.

The 1996 J.League season saw Verdy Kawasaki finish in 7th place overall, the lowest standing in the league&#x27;s existence at that point, and would fall further in the 1997 season, finishing 16th and 12th, in the 1st stage and 2nd stage, respectively, and 15th overall out of 17 teams. Although Verdy looked to return to prominence in 1999, finishing 2nd in the 1st Stage, the resurgence was short-lived as it fell to 10th in the 2nd stage.

Meanwhile, the team&#x27;s efforts to become &quot;Japan&#x27;s Team&quot; alienated local fans in Kawasaki. The expensive salaries and struggling attendance caused the club&#x27;s debts to mount. Struggling to compete with the newly professionalized crosstown rival Kawasaki Frontale and the nearby Yokohama Marinos and Yokohama Flügels, Verdy made the decision to leave Kawasaki.

=== Return to Tokyo (2001–2005) ===

In 2001, the club returned from Kawasaki to Chōfu, Tokyo and was renamed as Tokyo Verdy 1969 to reflect the new hometown and the club&#x27;s origins as Yomiuri. Although Verdy made the move to increase its fan base and distance itself from its rivals, by this time Tokyo was already home to a J1 club in FC Tokyo. Despite a sharp increase in crowd numbers for Verdy, this was still well below those of FC Tokyo. Their new local rivals had been promoted to J1 in 2000 and had already captured a vast number of the supporters Verdy had been hoping to attract.

In its first year in Tokyo, Tokyo Verdy 1969 found itself trailing FC Tokyo in the standings as well, and finished last in the division at 16th in the first stage of the 2001 season. Only the play of midseason acquisition Edmundo and a win in the final match of the second stage saved the club from relegation to J2. Tokyo Verdy 1969 was back at the bottom of the table in the first stage of the 2002 season, but again finished the season strong, placing 4th in the second stage.

Two mid-table finishes followed in 2003 and 2004, before Tokyo Verdy 1969, under Osvaldo Ardiles, won the Emperor&#x27;s Cup on 1 January 2005, its first major title in 9 years and the first in Tokyo. Winning the cup earned Verdy a spot in the 2006 AFC Champions League.

However, the 2005 season saw Tokyo Verdy 1969 fall to its worst finish of its history, finishing 17th out of 18. This was the first season after the scrapping of the two-stage season format, and Tokyo Verdy 1969 were relegated to J2, after 28 years of top flight football. The season was marked by three huge losses in July: 1–7 to Gamba Osaka on 2 July, 0–7 to Urawa Red Diamonds on 6 July and a 6–0 loss to Júbilo Iwata on 17 July. Tokyo Verdy then sacked Ardiles two days later. At the time of his sacking, Ardiles&#x27; team had conceded 23 goals in their last 5 matches and had a 9 match winless streak. However, the struggling Verdy upset European giant Real Madrid (who were in Asia on a preseason tour), 3–0 on 25 July.

=== Brief promotion (2007–2008) ===

For the 2006 season, the club appointed former Verdy Kawasaki legend, Ruy Ramos, as manager on 22 December 2005. Tokyo Verdy 1969 found itself in the odd position of competing in the AFC Champions League while playing in the second tier of the national league system. After Tokyo Verdy 1969 was relegated, the club released many of the veteran players, leaving a core of young players, most notably Takayuki Morimoto, who became the youngest player to score in the J.League at age 15 in 2004.

In the 2007 season, Tokyo Verdy 1969 managed to beat Thespa Kusatsu 5–0 on the first day. After a brief scuffle with Consadole Sapporo over the J2 title, Tokyo Verdy 1969 had to settle for runners-up position, enough to earn promotion back into the top flight for 2008. At this time the club renamed itself for the second time, dropping &quot;1969&quot; from its team name, but the management corporation name remained as &quot;Tokyo Verdy 1969&quot;.

Verdy would eventually be relegated once again after finishing in 17th place (second to last) in their 2008 J1 League return.

=== Back to the second tier (2009–2023) ===

On 17 September 2009, NTV announced it would divest itself of shares in the club and transfer it to a new holding company, Tokyo Verdy Holdings, closing 40 years of Yomiuri/NTV direct financial support. The J.League approved the transfer, but made it a condition that Verdy find a new sponsor by 16 November or risk not being able to play J2 football for the 2010 season.

In October 2010, Tokyo Verdy signed a five-year sponsorship deal with sports retail store and apparel company Xebio.
The sponsorship deal saw the Xebio logo placed on Tokyo Verdy&#x27;s kit and included naming rights for two regular season home games. Xebio also produced the clubs football kit, although under their sports brand &quot;Ennerre&quot;. After talks with Xebio, several companies decided to invest in the company and the new Xebio led administration was announced in November.

The club suffered a mere respite from heartbreak during the 2018 season, when they finished 6th, qualifying then for the promotion/relegation playoffs. They beat Omiya Ardija 1–0 in the 1st round, and repeated the script against Yokohama FC in the semi-final. They ended just one game short of a J1 League comeback, having lost in the final by 2–0 against Júbilo Iwata, which saw the promotion hopes fade away for another time. Ever since being relegated to the J2 at the end of 2008 season, the club were unable to return to the J1 and continue to compete in J2 League until 2023 season.

=== Return to the top-flight (2024–present) ===

On 2 December 2023, Tokyo Verdy gained promotion to the J1 League for the 2024 season after a 1–1 draw against Shimizu S-Pulse in the promotion play-off final, with Itsuki Someno scored the equalizer from the penalty spot in the 96th minute. As a result, Verdy, who were the top-ranked side entering the J2 League playoffs, returned to the national top tier for the first time since 2008.

== Stadium ==
Verdy plays its home games at the Ajinomoto Stadium, a stadium with the capacity of 49,970. It is shared with the club&#x27;s main rivals FC Tokyo, although occasional home matches are played in other stadiums in Tokyo, such as the Ajinomoto Field Nishigaoka.

== Kits and crests ==
Tokyo Verdy&#x27;s main colors are green.

The club&#x27;s name was coined from the Portuguese, or Spanish, or Italian, or Esperanto &quot;verde&quot; meaning &quot;green&quot;, probably named after their green jersey colour, so the meaning is &quot;Tokyo Greens/Tokyo Verdi&quot;. In Italian, the form &quot;verdi&quot; indicates the plural form &quot;the greens&quot;.

<text>The Chitimacha ( ; or ) are an Indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands in Louisiana. They are a federally recognized tribe, the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana.

The Chitimacha have an Indian reservation in St. Mary Parish near Charenton on Bayou Teche. Their reservation is a small part of their precontact territory. They are the only Louisiana tribe who still control some of their original land, where they have long occupied areas of the Atchafalaya Basin, &quot;one of the richest inland estuaries on the continent.&quot; In 2011 they numbered about 1100 people.

Historically, the Chitimacha spoke the Chitimacha language, a language isolate. The last two fluent speakers died in the 1930s, but the tribe has been working to revitalize the language since the 1990s. They use notes and recordings made by linguist Morris Swadesh around 1930. They have also started immersion classes for children and adults. In 2008 they partnered with Rosetta Stone in a two-year effort to develop software to support learning the language. Each tribal household was given a copy to support use of the language at home. The Chitimacha have used revenues from gambling to promote education and cultural preservation, founding a tribal museum and historic preservation office, and restoration of their language.

The Chitimacha are one of four federally recognized tribes in the state.

== Name ==
According to the Chitimacha, their name comes from the term &quot;Pantch Pinankanc,&quot; meaning &quot;men altogether red,&quot; also meaning &quot;warrior.&quot; The name &quot;Chawasha&quot;, a subtribe of the Chitimacha, is a Choctaw term for &quot;Raccoon Place.&quot; &quot;Washa&quot; is also Choctaw and means &quot;Hunting Pace.&quot; &quot;Yaganechito&quot; means &quot;Big Country.&quot;

== Subtribes ==
The Chitimacha were divided into four sub-tribes: the Chawasha, Chitimacha, Washa, and Yagenachito. These were divided by their geography. 

== Historical lifeways ==
The Chitimacha established their villages in the many swamps, bayous, and rivers of the Atchafalaya Basin, &quot;one of the richest inland estuaries on the continent.&quot; They knew this area intimately. The site conditions provided them with a natural defense against enemy attack and made these villages almost impregnable. As a result, they did not fortify them. The villages were rather large, with an average of about 500 inhabitants. Dwellings were constructed from available resources. Typically the people built walls from a framework of poles and plastered them with mud or palmetto leaves. The roofs were thatched.

The Chitimacha raised a variety of crops, and agricultural produce provided the mainstay of their diet. The women tended cultivation and the crops. They were skilled horticulturalists, raising numerous, distinct varieties of corn, beans, and squash. Corn was the main crop, supplemented by beans, squash and melons. The women also gathered wild foods and nuts. The men hunted for such game as deer, turkey and alligator. They also caught fish. The people stored grain crops in an elevated winter granary to supplement hunting and fishing.

Living by the waters, the Chitimacha made dugout canoes for transport. These vessels were constructed by carving out cypress logs. The largest could hold as many as 50 people. To gain the stones they needed for fashioning arrowheads and tools, the people traded crops for stone with tribes to the north. They also developed such weapons as the blow gun and cane dart. They adapted fish bones to use as arrowheads.

The Chitimacha were distinctive in their custom of flattening the foreheads of their male babies. They would bind them as infants to shape their skulls. Adult men would typically wear their hair long and loose. They were skilled practitioners of the art of tattooing, often covering their face, body, arms and legs with tattooed designs. Because of the hot and humid climate, the men generally wore only a breechcloth, and the women a short skirt.

Like many Native American peoples, the Chitimacha had a matrilineal kinship system, in which property and descent passed through the female lines. The hereditary male chiefs, who governed until early in the 20th century, came from the maternal lines and were approved by female elders. Children were considered to belong to their mother&#x27;s family and clan and took their status from her. Like other Native American tribes, the Chitimacha at times absorbed and acculturated other peoples. In addition, as Chitimacha women had relationships with European traders in the decades of more interaction, their mixed-race children were considered to belong to the mother&#x27;s family and were acculturated as Chitimacha.

The Chitimacha were divided into a strict class system of nobles and commoners. They had such a distinction that the two classes spoke different dialects. Intermarriage between the classes was forbidden.

== History ==
=== Precontact ===

The Chitimacha Indians and their ancestors inhabited the Mississippi River Delta area of south central Louisiana for thousands of years before European encounter. Their oral history states that their territory was marked by four prominent trees. Archaeological evidences suggest that the Chitimacha and their ancestors have lived in Louisiana for perhaps 6,000 years. Prior to that, they may have migrated into the area from west of the Mississippi River.

===Colonial period to 20th century===

At the time of Columbus’ arrival in America, historians estimate the combined strength of the four Chitimacha groups was about 20,000. Although the Chitimacha had virtually no direct contact with Europeans for two more centuries, they suffered Eurasian infectious diseases contracted from other Natives who had traded with them, such as measles, smallpox, and typhoid fever. Like other Native Americans, the Chitimacha had no immunity to these new diseases and suffered high fatalities in epidemics.

By 1700, when the French began to colonize the Mississippi River Valley, the number of Chitimacha had been dramatically reduced. Estimates for that time: the Chawasha had about 700 people, the Washa about 1,400; the Chitimacha some 4,000; and the Yagenichito about 3,000. (Kniffen et al. said 4,000 people in total in 1700; they may have known only about those classified as only Chitimacha.)

The sub-tribes of the Chitimacha confederation occupied a total of about 15 villages at the time of encounter with French explorers and colonists in the early 18th century. The French described the villages as self-governing groups. The Grand Chief represented the central governing authority of all the sub-tribes, but they operated in a highly decentralized manner. 
Between the years 1706 and 1718, the Chitimacha engaged in a long, bitter war with the French. With their superior firepower, the French nearly destroyed the eastern Chitimacha. Those who survived were resettled by the French authorities, away from the Gulf of Mexico and farther north along the Mississippi River, to the area where they live today. Disease caused more deaths than did warfare and ultimately resulted in dramatic social disruption and defeat of the people. The use of alcohol also took its toll, as they were highly vulnerable to it. By 1784, the combined numbers of the tribes had fallen to 180. In the early 1800s, a small group was absorbed by the &quot;Houma&quot; of Louisiana.

In the late 18th century, the British deported the Acadians (French colonists in Acadia) from eastern Canada after defeating France in the Seven Years&#x27; War and taking over their territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Some Acadian refugees were resettled in Louisiana along the Mississippi River; their descendants became known as Cajuns. They also put pressure on the Chitimacha population because they took over their land.

Eventually some Chitimacha married Acadians and gradually became acculturated to their community, including converting to Catholicism. Others absorbed Europeans into Chitimacha society. Mixed-race children born to Chitimacha women were considered to belong to their mother&#x27;s families and generally were raised within the Indigenous culture.

The Chitimacha in the mid-19th century sued the United States for confirmation of title to their tribal land. The federal government issued a decree establishing an area of 1,062 acres in St. Mary Parish as Chitimacha land.

=== 20th century ===
The 1900 federal census recorded six Chitimacha families with a total of 55 people, three of whom were classified as full-bloods. In 1910 there were 69 Chitimacha recorded; 19 of their children were students at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, where they boarded full time along with other Native American students from a wide variety of tribes. The Indian boarding schools were considered a means to assimilate the children into mainstream United States culture. They disrupted transmission of native languages by forcing the children to use English at school and taking them away from their families for lengthy periods of time.

The tribe was under economic pressure in the early 20th century, and sometimes members were forced to sell land because they could not afford taxes. Sarah Avery McIlhenney, a local benefactor whose family owned and operated the factory to manufacture Tabasco, responded to a call for aid by Chitimacha women. She purchased their last 260 acres of land at a sheriff&#x27;s sale in 1915; then transferred it to the tribe. They ceded the land to the federal government (Department of Interior) to be held in trust as a reservation for the tribe. McIlhenny also encouraged Federal recognition of the Chitimacha as a tribe, which the Department of Interior granted in 1917.

The Chitimacha were the first Native American tribe in Louisiana to gain federal recognition. Most Native Americans of the Southeast had been forcibly removed to Indian Territory or Texas west of the Mississippi River during the 1830s. The tribe received some annuities and financial benefits as a result of formal recognition. But the population continued its decline and by 1930, the Chitimacha had a recorded total of 51 people. Between 1903 and 1919, tribal members of mixed African and Native American ancestry were disenrolled from the Chitimacha tribe of Louisiana, and their descendants have since then been denied tribal membership.

Since that early 20th-century low, the population has increased as the people have recovered. Men began to gain better employment by working in the Louisiana oil fields as drillers and foremen. In the early 21st century, the tribe reported it has more than 900 enrolled members. The 2000 census reported a resident population of 409 persons living on the Chitimacha Indian Reservation. Of these, 285 identified as solely of Native American ancestry.

The reservation is located at in the northern part of the community of Charenton, in St. Mary Parish on Bayou Teche. This is in the Atchafalaya Basin, a rich estuary. The Chitimacha are the only Indigenous people in the state who still control some of their traditional lands. As with many Native American tribes, the Chitimacha took over their children&#x27;s education and have established the Chitimacha Tribal School on the reservation; it is sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

The Tribal Council is involved in ongoing negotiations with the United States to obtain compensation for the land expropriations of the past. With revenues derived from its gaming casino, the Chitimacha have purchased additional land to be held in trust for its reservation, and now control 1000 acres. It has established a casino, school, fish processing plant, and tribal museum on its reservation.

=== 21st century ===
&quot;Native Waters: A Chitimacha Recollection&quot; (2011) is a documentary directed and produced by Laudun for Louisiana Public Broadcasting. It won a 2012 Telly Award.

==Language==
The Chitimacha language became extinct after the last two native speakers, Benjamin Paul and Delphine Ducloux, died in the 1930s. But young linguist Morris Swadesh had worked with Paul and Ducloux from 1930 to record their language and stories. He made extensive notes in an effort to save the language and its traditional accounts. Most contemporary Chitimacha speak Cajun French and English.

With revenues from gaming, the tribe has established cultural revitalization activities: a tribal historic preservation office, language immersion classes, a tribal museum, and a project to promote river cane regrowth on tribal lands to support weaving traditional baskets. In the early 1990s, the tribe was contacted by the American Philosophical Society Library, which said it held Swadesh&#x27;s papers and had found extensive notes on the Chitimacha language, including a draft grammar manual and dictionary. A small team was recruited to try to learn the language quickly and begin to prepare materials to transmit it, such as a storybook. Language immersion classes were started in the school for children.

In 2008 the tribe partnered with Rosetta Stone to develop software to document the language and provide teaching materials. Each tribal household was given a copy of the software, to support families learning the language and encouraging children to speak it at home. The collaborative project is also producing a complete dictionary and learner&#x27;s reference grammar for the language.

==Government==
The Chitimacha re-established their government under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, considered President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Native American New Deal. The tribe successfully resisted efforts in the 1950s to terminate them as a tribe under federal policy of the time, a move which would have ended their relationship with the federal government.

In 1971 they adopted a new written constitution. They have an elected representative government, with two-year terms for the five members of the Tribal Council. Three are elected from single-member districts and two members are elected at-large.

== Citizenship ==
Like all federally recognized tribes, the Chitimacha, through passage of their constitution, have established their own rules for tribal membership. According to the constitution, they require that members have a certain blood quantum and be able to document direct descent from a member listed on one of two official rolls: 
*Annuity Pay Roll of 1926, recorded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or 
*Revised census roll of June 1959, of record at the Choctaw Indian Agency, Philadelphia, Mississippi.

In addition, a prospective member must be able to document having at least one-sixteenth (1/16) degree Chitimacha Indian ancestry (equivalent to one great-great-grandparent). Children of one-sixteenth (1/16) degree or more Chitimacha Indian blood born to any enrolled member since 1971 (when the tribe adopted their Constitution) are entitled to membership.&lt;br&gt;

== Basketry ==
Among their arts, Chitimacha women weave highly refined baskets from rivercane. They typically use three colors: yellow, red, and black. They have woven baskets for sale throughout the centuries to today, as an important part of their economy. One basket maker who excelled at the double-weave technique, Ada Thomas, was honored as a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1983. Sarah Sense, an acclaimed artist and scholar of Chitimacha/Choctaw descent, has researched Chitimacha basket designs and incorporates these into two-dimensional woven photoworks and three-dimensional woven basket works.

<doc id="680390" wikidata="Q285460" url="?curid=680390" title="Judge Reinhold">
<text>Edward Ernest &quot;Judge&quot; Reinhold Jr. (born May 21, 1957) is an American actor who is best known for his work in Hollywood films during the 1980s. He has starred in several popular films such as &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), and &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (1986). He has co-starred in all of the films in the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; series (1984, 1987, 1994, and 2024) and &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; (1994, 2002 and 2006) franchises.

==Early life==
Reinhold was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of Regina Celeste ( Fleming; 1923–2023) and Edward Ernest Reinhold (1907–1977), a trial lawyer. He was raised in Fredericksburg, Virginia and attended James Monroe High School until his family moved to Martin County, Florida, prior to his junior year in high school. He attended Mary Washington College and Palm Beach State College (known as &quot;Palm Beach Junior College&quot; at the time). His maternal grandfather was from County Meath, Ireland.

==Career==
===Early roles===

Reinhold had a lead role in the movie &quot;Running Scared&quot; (1980) and a supporting part in the comedy &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), which was a big hit. He was one of many names in the flop comedy &quot;Pandemonium&quot; (1982).

Reinhold&#x27;s first major film role was as high school senior Brad Hamilton in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), along with then-unknown actors Sean Penn, Phoebe Cates, Forest Whitaker, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nicolas Cage, Anthony Edwards and Eric Stoltz. &quot;I thought my career would really take off after that role,&quot; Reinhold said later. &quot;Instead, Sean&#x27;s career took off.&quot;

Reinhold had small roles in &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; (1983) and &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984), and he appeared in an uncredited role in Pat Benatar&#x27;s music video for &quot;Shadows of the Night&quot;.

===&quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and stardom===
Reinhold&#x27;s career began to gain momentum when he played Detective Billy Rosewood, the junior police detective sent to trail Eddie Murphy&#x27;s character, in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984).

The film&#x27;s success led to Reinhold being given starring roles in &quot;Roadhouse 66&quot; (1985), &quot;Head Office&quot; (1985) and &quot;Off Beat&quot;, but none of those were particularly successful. However, &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (1986), where he had a supporting role, was a big hit. That year, he said in an interview, &quot;In my movies I portray this &#x27;Everyman&#x27; persona, someone everybody can empathize with. People can identify with a guy like me.&quot;

Reinhold tried to get financing for a film based on Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;Tourist Season&quot;, but it was never made. Instead, he appeared in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987), which was another large success.

Reinhold was given the lead in &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1988), but it flopped. &quot;That was really the end of my highfalutin Hollywood career,&quot; Reinhold said later. &quot;That&#x27;s when the phone stopped ringing.&quot; He also developed a reputation for being difficult on set. &quot;I was spoiled, and I was arrogant,&quot; said Reinhold of this period later. &quot;I was very demanding, had an overblown image of who I was and got a reputation for being difficult. And rightfully so.&quot;

===Return to supporting roles===
He had supporting roles in &quot;Rosalie Goes Shopping&quot; (1989) and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Dyin&#x27;: Who&#x27;s Got the Will?&quot; (1990), and the lead in &quot;Enid Is Sleeping&quot; (1991) and &quot;Zandalee&quot; (1991, which he also produced).

Reinhold starred in the Canadian hard rock band Harem Scarem&#x27;s 1992 music video &quot;Honestly&quot; as the male love interest. In 1994, Reinhold appeared in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; and &quot;The Santa Clause.&quot; He reprised the latter role of Dr. Neal Miller in &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause&quot; (2006).

===Later career===
Reinhold was nominated for an Emmy for a role on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in which he played the &quot;close talker&quot; who develops an obsession with Jerry&#x27;s parents. He can also be seen in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s epic miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot; and replaced Charles Grodin in two direct-to-video movies in the &quot;Beethoven&quot; film series.

Reinhold appeared in the 2008 political satire &quot;Swing Vote&quot;.

In September 2022, it was confirmed Reinhold reprised his role as Detective Billy Rosewood in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Reinhold was nicknamed &quot;Judge&quot; because, when he was a baby, he looked stern and judge-like.

He and his second wife, Amy Reinhold, have a daughter named Haley Rose who was born in February 2013. They live together in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Reinhold was arrested at Dallas Love Field airport on December 8, 2016, for disorderly conduct after objecting to a patdown from security shortly after he was released from the hospital following an adverse reaction to a medication. He spent ten hours in jail and accepted a deferred adjudication agreement under which charges would be dismissed in 90 days.

==In popular culture==
Reinhold has occasionally been referred to in film and television, largely in reference to his nickname, Judge. The earliest example was &quot;&quot;, where Reinhold voiced a judge called Judge Reinhold. In the &quot;Becker&quot; episode &quot;Trials and Defibrillations&quot;, the presiding judge is called Judge (Miriam) Reinhold.

In &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, Reinhold, playing himself, appears as the judge of a fictional court show, a parody of such series as &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Judge Mathis&quot;. In the film &quot;Fanboys&quot;, Billy Dee Williams appears as a courtroom judge named &quot;Judge Reinhold&quot;.

Reinhold stars as the ex-boyfriend, terrorized by a jilted lover, in Jo-El Sonnier&#x27;s 1988 music video for &quot;Tear Stained Letter&quot;.

Like many neighboring towns, Stockholm is home to a number of lakes including Deer Trail Lakes, Lake Stockholm, Lake Gerard, Beaver Lake, Lake Tamarack and Summit Lake.

Stockholm was known in colonial times as &quot;Snufftown&quot;, which got its name from the action for traveling to the top of the mountain to go buy liquor. Those residing in other towns would proceed to Snufftown to go drinking. The New Jersey Midland Railway named a station in the area &quot;Stockholm&quot;, which replaced &quot;Snufftown&quot;. Despite the name, there is no evidence of a connection to Sweden or to settlement by Swedes in the area.

As of the 2010 United States Census, the population for ZIP Code Tabulation Area 07460 was 3,457.

==Climate==
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Stockholm has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. This climate makes it suitable for naturism and the Rock Lodge Club naturist resort is near Lake Stockholm.

== Emergency service ==
The Stockholm Fire Department, also known as the Hardyston Fire Department Company 1, was founded in 1955. It is located at 7 Colson Terrace.

==Notable people==

People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Hardyston Township include:
* A. L. A. Himmelwright (1865-1936), a civil engineer, author, adventurer and marksman who was the general manager of The Roebling Construction Company.
* Christopher Sieber (born 1969), actor best known for his roles as Kevin Burke in &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; starring Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen, and Lord Farquaad in &quot;Shrek the Musical&quot;.

<doc id="680396" wikidata="Q693627" url="?curid=680396" title="Full Circle (The Doors album)">
<text>Full Circle is the eighth studio album by the American rock band the Doors, released in August 1972. It is the second album after Jim Morrison&#x27;s death, and their last until the 1978 album &quot;An American Prayer&quot;. The album includes &quot;The Mosquito&quot;, the last Doors single to chart.

==Recording and composition==
The band&#x27;s first album without Jim Morrison, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Other Voices&quot;, had reached No. 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, showing the group could survive Morrison&#x27;s death. The band – now a trio consisting of keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore – chose to record &quot;Other Voices&quot; at their rehearsal space known as the Workshop, the same two-story building at 8512 Santa Monica Boulevard they had recorded the successful &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, but for &quot;Full Circle&quot; they opted to move to Hollywood&#x27;s A&amp;M Studio. While &quot;Other Voices&quot; was, to a degree, an extension of the &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; sessions (some of the tracks had been worked up before Morrison had left for Paris), &quot;Full Circle&quot; was a standalone work that saw the band delve deeper into jazz and work with some top-shelf session musicians. Bruce Botnick, who had engineered all the Doors albums up to that point and co-produced both &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; and &quot;Other Voices&quot;, declined to participate in the sessions. In 2015 he admitted to &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s Tom Pinnock that he could not remember whether he was asked to return or not, but maintains he would have turned down the offer, reflecting, &quot;The guys wanted to have a chance to work with some other musicians. As they went into &quot;Full Circle&quot; they took that extension even further.&quot;

The Doors hired Henry Lewy to replace Botnick, who in turn brought in Charles Lloyd and a host of session players. Lloyd contributed tenor sax and flute to the songs and also played behind the band at Central Park and at the Hollywood Bowl. As with &quot;Other Voices&quot;, Manzarek and Krieger assumed vocal duties, which were augmented with backing vocalists. Although both post-Morrison albums are viewed as non-essential to many Doors fans and critics, &quot;Full Circle&quot; produced a global hit for the band: &quot;The Mosquito&quot;. As recounted in &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s 2015 profile of both LPs, the song has become one of the band&#x27;s most enduring tracks across the globe, with the song&#x27;s author Krieger recalling:

&quot;Full Circle&quot; showed the band was still evolving musically, with the Latin fusion of &quot;The Piano Bird&quot; and the complex funk of &quot;Verdilac,&quot; but tensions were mounting between Manzarek, who wanted to explore jazz, and Densmore and Krieger, who wanted to persevere with rock. &quot;Ray just kinda said, &#x27;Look, I&#x27;m outta here, I&#x27;m getting tired of this, it&#x27;s not working,&#x27;&quot; Krieger recalled to &quot;Uncut&quot; in 2015. &quot;So we gave up. John and I were trying to make it work. Would we have carried on? Yeah, for sure.&quot;

In 1972, the Doors released &quot;Get Up and Dance&quot; as a single; the B-side was the non-album track &quot;Treetrunk&quot;, one of only three non-album studio tracks released by the band. According to Robby Krieger, the track was left off the album because &quot;it sounded too commercial.&quot; The song was finally given official re-release as part of the Japan edition of the Doors Singles Box in 2013.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Full Circle&quot; was released on August 15, 1972 and peaked at No. 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. In a retrospective assessment, AllMusic stated &quot;While there are a handful of undeniably remarkable cuts scattered throughout, &quot;Full Circle&quot; is increasingly sporadic and less focused than its predecessor&quot; but asserts that the album&#x27;s centerpiece is &quot;the nearly four-minute jam tacked on at the end. Manzarek&#x27;s impassioned electric organ, Densmore&#x27;s tricky timekeeping, and Krieger&#x27;s transcendent string work are all worth mentioning as the intensity of their interplay hearkens back to former glories.&quot; In 2011 &quot;Uncut&quot; surmised of the LP, &quot;Now the problems start. A strained-sounding attempt to boogie like a bar band, with lame lyrics about &quot;good rocking&quot;... its eagerness to get our hands clapping makes it sound desperate.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; called the single &quot;Get Up and Dance&quot; a &quot;steady rocker which is just different enough to stand up to repeated listenings.&quot;

==Later releases==
For years the Doors have largely disregarded the two post-Morrison albums, with no official American CD releases. &quot;Full Circle&quot; was released on CD October 23, 2006 by the Timeless Holland label, along with the previous (post-Morrison) Doors album &quot;Other Voices&quot;. It is relatively easy to find unofficial CD copies of &quot;Full Circle&quot; and &quot;Other Voices&quot; on the Internet, but most of these vinyl-to-CD transfers do not contain the single-only &quot;Treetrunk&quot;, except for the Howling Wolf Records 2010 release of the two albums on one CD. This release also featured the edited single versions of &quot;The Mosquito&quot; and &quot;The Piano Bird.&quot; &quot;Treetrunk&quot; was finally given official re-release as part of the Japan edition of the Doors Singles Box in 2013. The Doors&#x27; management has stated they are not in possession of the master tapes to the two post-Morrison albums, but remastered tracks from both of them can nevertheless be found on later official releases. The first track from &quot;Full Circle&quot; the Doors have reissued was &quot;The Mosquito&quot;, released in 2000 as &quot;No Me Moleste Mosquito&quot; on the double-disc version of &quot;The Best of The Doors&quot;.

On September 27, 2011, the Doors finally gave &quot;Full Circle&quot;, along with &quot;Other Voices&quot;, its first official reissue through digital download. It was confirmed that the original master tapes were used for these reissues.

On May 29, 2015, it was announced that &quot;Other Voices&quot; and &quot;Full Circle&quot; would be re-released together on a 2-CD set and individually on 180-gram vinyl by Rhino Records on September 4 of that year. The CD set features &quot;Treetrunk&quot;—the B-side of the &quot;Get Up and Dance&quot; single—as its only bonus track.

<doc id="680398" wikidata="Q722267" url="?curid=680398" title="Beverly Hills Cop">
<text>Beverly Hills Cop is a 1984 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Martin Brest, with a screenplay by Daniel Petrie Jr., and story by Danilo Bach and Daniel Petrie Jr. It stars Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street-smart Detroit detective who visits Beverly Hills, California, to solve the murder of his best friend. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, Lisa Eilbacher, Steven Berkoff, Paul Reiser, and Jonathan Banks appear in supporting roles.

This first film in the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; franchise shot Murphy to international stardom, won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Favorite Motion Picture&quot;, and was nominated for both the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1985. The film was released on December 5, 1984 by Paramount Pictures. An immediate blockbuster, it received positive reviews and earned $316.3 million at the wordwide box office, making it the highest-grossing film released in the U.S. in 1984. In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Adjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing R-rated film in the U.S. since 1977, with a total box office gross of $730,714,743 in 2024.

==Plot==
Axel Foley is a plainclothes Detroit police detective whose latest unauthorized sting operation goes sour when two uniformed officers intervene, resulting in a high-speed chase through the city that causes widespread damage. Axel&#x27;s superior, Inspector Douglas Todd, reprimands him for his reckless behavior and threatens to fire him unless he changes his ways.

Axel arrives at his apartment to find it has been broken into by his childhood friend, Michael &quot;Mikey&quot; Tandino. Mikey had done prison time for a car theft the pair had committed in their youth, but has since landed a job as a security guard in Beverly Hills thanks to mutual friend Jenny Summers.

Mikey shows Axel some German bearer bonds and Axel wonders how he got them, but chooses not to question him about it. After going out to a bar, they return to Axel&#x27;s apartment, where two men, Zack and Casey, knock Axel unconscious, confront Mikey about the stolen bonds, and murder him.

Axel asks to be assigned to investigate Mikey&#x27;s murder, but Inspector Todd won&#x27;t allow it due to his close ties to Mikey. Under the guise of taking vacation time, Axel travels to Beverly Hills to solve the crime himself. He finds Jenny working in an art gallery and learns about Mikey&#x27;s ties to Victor Maitland, the gallery&#x27;s owner. Posing as a flower deliveryman, Axel goes to Maitland&#x27;s office to question him about Mikey, but is thrown out of a window by Maitland&#x27;s bodyguards and arrested for trespassing.

At the local police station, Beverly Hills Police Department Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil assigns Sergeant John Taggart and Detective Billy Rosewood to follow Axel. They have a humiliating and comical encounter with him when he temporarily disables their car. As a result, Rosewood and Taggart do not get along with Axel at first, but the three begin to develop a mutual respect after they foil a robbery at a striptease bar.

Continuing his investigation, Axel sneaks into one of Maitland&#x27;s warehouses, where he finds crates full of coffee grounds. He suspects they have been used to pack drugs, since he knows they are often used to cover the scent of drugs from police dogs. Axel also discovers that many of Maitland&#x27;s crates have not gone through customs.

After being arrested again, this time after a scuffle with Zack at Maitland&#x27;s country club, Axel attempts to alert Bogomil that Maitland must be a smuggler, but Beverly Hills Police Chief Hubbard, who has learned of Axel&#x27;s ill-advised investigative actions, orders that he be escorted out of town. Axel convinces Billy to pick up Jenny instead and take her with them to the warehouse, where a shipment is due to arrive that day.

Axel and Jenny break into the warehouse and discover several bags of cocaine inside a crate. Before he can get this new-found evidence to Billy, Maitland arrives with his associates Zack and Casey. Maitland takes Jenny and leaves Axel, ordering that he be killed. Zack then tells Axel that he was the one who killed Mikey. After some hesitation, Billy enters the warehouse and rescues Axel after a brief gunfight during which he kills Casey.

Taggart tracks Axel and Billy to Maitland&#x27;s estate, where he joins the two in rescuing Jenny and bringing Maitland to justice. Together, the trio wipe out four of Maitland&#x27;s men, including Zack. With Bogomil&#x27;s help, Axel then kills Maitland and rescues Jenny.

Bogomil fabricates a story to Hubbard that manages to cover for all the participants without discrediting the police department. Axel, realizing that his exploits while &quot;on vacation&quot; will likely get him fired, asks Bogomil to smooth matters over with Inspector Todd. When Axel mentions the possibility of setting up shop as a private investigator in Beverly Hills, Bogomil nervously agrees to wipe the slate clean for him.

Later, Taggart and Billy meet Axel as he is checking out of his hotel and pay his bill. He invites them to join him for a farewell drink, and they accept the offer.

===Development and writing===

In 1977, Paramount executive Don Simpson came up with a movie idea about a cop from East L.A. who transferred to Beverly Hills. Screenwriter Danilo Bach was called in to write the screenplay. Bach pitched his idea to Simpson and Paramount in 1981 under the name &quot;Beverly Drive&quot;, about a cop from Pittsburgh named Elly Axel. However, his script was a straight action film and Bach was forced to make changes to the script, but after a few attempts the project went stale. With the success of &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), Simpson saw the Beverly Hills film as his next big project.

Daniel Petrie Jr. was brought in to rewrite the script and Paramount loved Petrie&#x27;s humorous approach to the project, with the lead character now called Axel Elly, from Detroit. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer claimed that the role of Axel Foley was first offered to Mickey Rourke, who signed a $400,000 holding contract to do the film. When revisions and other preparations took longer than expected, Rourke left the project to do another film. Martin Scorsese was offered to direct the film but turned it down as he felt that the film&#x27;s concept was too similar to &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot;. David Cronenberg was also offered to direct the film but also turned it down.

Sylvester Stallone was originally considered for the part of Foley. Stallone gave the script a dramatic rewrite, removing all the story&#x27;s humor and turning the film back into a standard action movie. In one of the previous drafts written for Stallone, the character of Billy Rosewood was called &quot;Siddons&quot; and was killed off half-way through the script during one of the action scenes. Stallone had renamed the lead character to Axel Cobretti, with the character of Michael Tandino being his brother and Jenny Summers playing his love interest.

Stallone has said that his script for &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; would have &quot;looked like the opening scene from &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; on the beaches of Normandy. Believe it or not, the finale was me in a stolen Lamborghini playing chicken with an oncoming freight train being driven by the ultra-slimy bad guy.&quot; Producer Don Simpson let it be known they didn&#x27;t want to move forward with Stallone&#x27;s revisions; since Stallone wasn&#x27;t willing to negotiate the rewrite, Simpson asked writer Charles &quot;Chip&quot; Proser if he could return the script to previous iteration, while leaving most of Stallone&#x27;s character revisions intact. However Proser found the task (and turnaround time) preposterous.&quot;They offered me the rewrite when it was nothing more than Sylvester Stallone and an exotic gun—which was pretty ridiculous&quot;, remembered screenwriter Chip Proser, who would later write [an uncredited rewrite of] Simpson and Bruckheimer&#x27;s &quot;Top Gun&quot;.According to co-producer Don Simpson, Stallone’s new script spent too much time on the star &quot;&#x27;soaping down his muscles&quot;.&#x27; Stallone ultimately dropped out two weeks before filming was to start, ostensibly to concentrate on his next picture, the 1984 film &quot;Rhinestone&quot;. Stallone later used the bulk of these ideas as the basis for the 1986 film &quot;Cobra&quot;.

Don Simpson would later tell friends a story—impossible to corroborate—about how he finally got Stallone off the project and got the project back on track: He and Stallone had a mutual interest in &quot;youth treatments&quot; and Simpson knew of a Swiss doctor who was experimenting with injections of a sheep hormone that increased tumescence. Simpson managed to get Stallone&#x27;s name &quot;put at the top of the list,&quot; Simpson boasted to a friend, for an appointment with the very exclusive doctor. Stallone flew to Switzerland, and Simpson promptly continued working on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; without him.

Two days later, the film&#x27;s producers, Simpson and Bruckheimer, convinced Eddie Murphy to replace Stallone in the film, prompting more rewrites as Murphy felt the original script &quot;wasn&#x27;t funny&quot;. Besides Stallone and Rourke, other actors who were considered for the role of Axel Foley included Richard Pryor, Al Pacino, and James Caan. Harrison Ford was offered the role of Axel Foley but turned it down. The final shooting draft of the script, which was extensively revised with Murphy&#x27;s input, was not completed until the day production began.

===Filming===
The film was budgeted at $14 million, including $4 million for Murphy, and was completed for around $13 million. Production began in May 1984 and continued into the summer, taking place mostly in and around Los Angeles. The opening sequence was filmed over several days in Michigan, in Detroit and nearby Wayne. Many scenes set in Beverly Hills were shot in Pasadena, as the city of Beverly Hills prohibited filming after 10:30 p.m.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

The soundtrack was released on MCA Records and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media (1986). It featured three top 10 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the instrumental title tune, &quot;Axel F&quot;, composed and performed by Harold Faltermeyer, the Glenn Frey song &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, and &quot;Neutron Dance,&quot; performed by the Pointer Sisters. The soundtrack also had two Patti LaBelle hits, &quot;New Attitude,&quot; which hit the top twenty on the US, and the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Stir It Up.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; was released on December 5, 1984, in 1,532 theaters. It debuted in first place at the US box office, making $15,214,805 in its first five days of release. It expanded on December 21 into 2,006 theatres. The film stayed at number one for 13 consecutive weeks and returned to number one in its 15th weekend making 14 non-consecutive weeks at number one tying &quot;Tootsie&quot; for the film with the most weeks at number one.

The film earned $234,760,478 in the United States, and $316,360,478 worldwide, being the highest-grossing film released in 1984. Adjusted for inflation, it is the third highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time behind &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot;. For nearly two decades, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; held the record for having the highest domestic gross for an R-rated film until 2003, when it was taken by &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;.

Adjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time at the U.S. box office, with a total box office gross of $730,714,743 in 2024. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 67 million tickets in the US.

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 83% from 53 critics with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;The buddy cop movie continues its evolution unabated with this Eddie Murphy vehicle that&#x27;s fast, furious, and funny.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; finds Eddie Murphy doing what he does best: playing the shrewdest, hippest, fastest-talking underdog in a rich man&#x27;s world. Eddie Murphy knows exactly what he&#x27;s doing, and he wins at every turn.&quot;

Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;Eddie Murphy exuded the kind of cheeky, cocky charm that has been missing from the screen since Cagney was a pup, snarling his way out of the ghetto.&quot; Axel Foley became Murphy&#x27;s signature role and was ranked 78 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; as the third best comedy film of the last 25 years. According to Christopher Hitchens, the British novelist and poet Kingsley Amis considered the film &quot;a flawless masterpiece.&quot;

John Simon of &quot;National Review&quot; called &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; &quot;a truly contemptible film.&quot;

In 2003, the film was picked by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of &quot;The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made&quot;.

Beverly Hills Cop is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.

===Home media===
The film shipped a record 1.3 million videos in the United States on its initial release.

==Sequels==
The film spawned a film series with three sequels, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot;, all starring Eddie Murphy. Judge Reinhold reprised his role for the sequels. John Ashton returned for the second and fourth film, but not third. The second film met with mixed reviews but was a box office success, while the third film was unsuccessful, both critically and commercially.

In 2013, a television series was reported to be in the works for CBS. The pilot was written by Shawn Ryan and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Brandon T. Jackson was cast as Axel Foley&#x27;s son. The series was not picked up, but Ryan reported that it tested well enough for Paramount to put a fourth film into production.

On November 14, 2019, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; announced that Paramount Pictures made a one-time license deal with an option for a sequel to Netflix to create the fourth film. In April 2022, Mark Molloy was announced as the film&#x27;s director, while Will Beall penned the script. The official teaser trailer for the fourth film was released on December 14, 2023. The film was released in July 2024.

<text>Sir Frederick Arthur Gore Ouseley, 2nd Baronet (12 August 18256 April 1889) was an English composer, organist, musicologist and priest.

==Biography==
Frederick Ouseley was born in London, the son of Sir Gore Ouseley, and manifested an extraordinary precocity in music, composing an opera (&quot;L&#x27;Isola disabitata&quot;) at the age of eight years. In 1844 he succeeded to the baronetcy. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1843, where he graduated BA in 1846 and MA in 1849. He was ordained in the latter year, and, as curate of St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, served the parish of St Barnabas, Pimlico until 1851.

Throughout his life, Ouseley experienced a social conflict between his aristocratic heritage and his interest in the performance of Anglican church music, an activity which was seen as beneath someone of his stature. In 1850 he took the degree of Mus.B. at the University of Oxford, and four years afterwards that of Mus.D., his exercise being the oratorio &quot;The Martyrdom of St Polycarp&quot;. He was Heather Professor of Music at Oxford from 1855 to 1889. In 1856, Ouseley both founded and endowed with his own funds St Michael&#x27;s College on the outskirts of Tenbury Wells, a choir school intended to serve as a model for Anglican church music. Ouseley was clear that the standard of music in the English church was lacking and through his foundation at Tenbury, he would help to change that. As well as being the college founder, he became the school&#x27;s first warden.

==Death==
Ouseley died in Hereford, where he had been precentor at Hereford Cathedral since 1855.

==Works==
Ouseley&#x27;s works included a second oratorio, &quot;Hagar&quot; (Hereford, 1873), a great number of services and anthems, psalm chants, cantatas, chamber music, organ pieces and songs. Among his instructional treaties on harmony, counterpoint, fugue, and composition are &quot;Harmony&quot; (1868) and &quot;Counterpoint&quot; (1869) and &quot;Musical Form&quot; (1875). He also added a series of chapters on English music to the English translation of Emil Naumann&#x27;s History of Music, the subject having been practically ignored in the German treatise.

See the map of the St. John&#x27;s East riding.

==History==
The riding was created when Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949 and has historically been a conservative stronghold. St. John&#x27;s East was won by Liberal Bonnie Hickey in 1993 election, who was defeated by Progressive Conservative Norman Doyle in the 1997 election. Doyle held the riding for the PCs and then the Conservatives, but stood down in 2008 and was replaced in a landslide by New Democrat, Jack Harris. Harris held the riding until his defeat in the 2015 election by Nick Whalen. That result was considered one of the biggest surprises of the 2015 election.

Following the 2012 electoral redistribution, 21% of the riding was moved into Avalon, and it gained 5% from St. John&#x27;s South—Mount Pearl.

Following the 2022 electoral redistribution, it will lose all of its territory in Paradise to Cape Spear, and it will gain the rest of St. John&#x27;s Harbour, the Wishingwell Park area and the Ayre Athletic Field area from St. John&#x27;s South—Mount Pearl.

<doc id="680409" wikidata="Q1544827" url="?curid=680409" title="Greenway Estate">
<text>Greenway, also known as Greenway House, is an estate on the River Dart near Galmpton in Devon, England. Once the home of the author Agatha Christie, it is now owned by the National Trust.

The estate is served by a steam railway service with trains from Paignton and Kingswear stopping at Greenway Halt station.

==History==
===Location and early development: up to 1938===
Greenway is located on the eastern bank of the tidal River Dart, facing the village of Dittisham on the opposite bank. The estate is two miles from Galmpton, the nearest village, and is in the South Hams district of the English county of Devon. Greenway is three miles north of Dartmouth. An early history book of Devon described Greenway as &quot;very pleasantly and commodiously situated, with delightsome prospect to behold the barks and boats&quot;.

Greenway was first mentioned in 1493 as &quot;Greynway&quot;, the crossing point of the Dart to Dittisham. In the late 16th century a Tudor mansion called Greenway Court was built by Otto and Katherine Gilbert, members of a Devon seafaring family. One of the family&#x27;s ships was named &quot;The Hope of Greenway&quot; and, according to Sara Burdett&#x27;s history of the estate, it is probable that they kept their ships moored in the river. The couple had three sons, all born at Greenway. In 1583 one son, Sir Humphrey, took possession of Newfoundland for Elizabeth I, while his brother, Sir John, lived at Greenway. Humphrey and John&#x27;s half-brother, Sir Walter Raleigh, also lived at the house. In 1588 John was given the responsibility of 160 prisoners of war captured during the Spanish Armada; he put them to work on the estate, levelling the grounds.

Little is known about the original Tudor building, although given the status of the family, Burdett considers it was &quot;probably designed on a grand scale&quot;. An archaeological examination of the current house&#x27;s hallway shows evidence of a Tudor courtyard underneath. Remnants of the Tudor slipway from the boathouse, can be seen at low tide.

In around 1700 the Gilberts made nearby Compton Castle their family seat and sold Greenway to Thomas Martyn, a resident of Totnes, also in Devon. Over the next 90 years the house passed down through the Roopes—the family of Martyn&#x27;s wife—until it was bequeathed to a distant relation of the family, Roope Harris, on the proviso that he changed his surname to Roope. Roope Harris Roope, as he became, built what is now the existing house in Georgian style. Roope sold Greenway in 1791 to one Edward Elton for over £9,000. Roope went bankrupt in 1800; Burdett opines that this could have been because of the amount of money spent on rebuilding Greenway.
The Elton family developed the garden, with some remodelling by the landscape gardener Humphry Repton. At some point in the late 18th century the Tudor house was entirely demolished. Burdett considers it was possibly Roope, while Historic England think it was more likely to have been Edward Elton. Elton&#x27;s son, James, took possession of the house upon the death of his father in 1811, and expanded the property, adding two wings to the house, for a dining room and drawing room. He also paid for a new road from Galmpton to Greenway ferry, which changed the access to the estate. When he sold the estate in 1832, it was much changed, with a large kitchen garden, swimming pool, boat house and redesigned gardens. The estate was purchased, although only briefly, by a Sir Thomas Dinsdale, but was soon sold for £18,000 to Colonel Edward Carlyon, whose family owned Tregrehan House, in Cornwall. The Carlyons did not make any significant alterations to the interior of the house; but, according to Burdett, they are likely the owners who introduced a rockery to the slope on the east of the house.
Carlyon inherited Tregrehan House in 1842, and moved there the following year. Greenway was let out to a series of tenants until it was sold twice in quick succession, the last time to Richard Harvey—a Cornish copper and tin magnate—and his wife Susannah. The Harveys developed the estate extensively, restoring the stables and lodge house, installing two new greenhouses and redecorating the interior. They restored much of Galmpton, including building the village school and the Manor Inn; Harvey also acquired the Lordship of the manor of Galmpton. Harvey died in 1870, his wife in 1882; they had no children to pass the estate on to, and it was sold for £44,000 to Thomas Bedford Bolitho. Bolitho, the industrialist MP for St Ives, added what Burdett describes as &quot;a Cornish influence&quot; on the gardens, introducing plants such as camellias, magnolias, rhododendrons and laurels. He built a new east wing to the house in 1892, which included a billiard room, study and bedrooms; this was demolished in 1938. Bolitho died in 1919 and the house passed to his daughter Mary, and her husband, Charles Williams, whose family owned Caerhays Castle near St Michael Caerhays, Cornwall. Between them the couple added several new varieties of plants from nurseries in Cornwall. In 1937 they returned to Cornwall and sold the estate to Alfred Goodson. He split up the estate and sold it off the following year. The house, with of land, was available for sale for £6,000.

===Agatha Christie and later: 1938 onwards===
In 1938, the writer Agatha Christie and her husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan, were becoming disenchanted with their home in nearby Torquay. The town had changed in the previous years, and the once uninterrupted view of the sea from the house became obstructed with new buildings. Looking around south Devon, Christie saw Greenway was available. She had seen the property during her youth and always thought it &quot;the most perfect of the various properties on the Dart&quot;. In her later autobiography she wrote:

One day we saw that a house was up for sale that I had known when I was young ... So we went over to Greenway, and very beautiful the house and grounds were. A white Georgian house of about 1780 or 90, with woods sweeping down to the Dart below, and a lot of fine shrubs and trees – the ideal house, a dream house.

The house was occupied by Christie and Mallowan until their deaths in 1976 and 1978 respectively, and featured, under various guises, in several of Christie&#x27;s novels. Christie&#x27;s daughter Rosalind Hicks and her husband Anthony lived in the house from 1968 until Rosalind&#x27;s death in 2004.
The Greenway Estate was acquired by the National Trust in 2000 for its significance as a writer&#x27;s home. On 21 May 1985 Greenway House was made a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage (now Historic England) under list number 1108548. The &quot;Pevsner&quot; guide for Devon describes it as &quot;tall, late-Georgian, stuccoed&quot;. The gardens and parkland are Grade II listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The house and gardens are open to the public, as is the Barn Gallery. The large riverside gardens contain plants from the southern hemisphere, whilst the Barn Gallery shows work by contemporary local artists.

==Inspiration for Agatha Christie&#x27;s works==
Agatha Christie frequently used places familiar to her as settings for her plots. Greenway Estate and its surroundings in their entirety or in parts are described in the following novels:

*&quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; (1936)
The character Sir Carmichael Clarke, a wealthy man from Churston, is one of three victims to have a copy of the A.B.C. Railway Guide left by his body. Churston is two miles from Greenway Estate and the station before Greenway Halt on the steam railway line. Within the plot, the &#x27;C&#x27; of &#x27;A.B.C.&#x27; refers to Churston as well as the character&#x27;s name.

*&quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; (1942)
The main house, the footpath leading from the main house to the battery overlooking the river Dart and the battery itself (where the murder occurs) are described in detail since the movements of the novel&#x27;s protagonist at these locations are integral to the plot and the denouement of the murderer.

*&quot;Towards Zero&quot; (1944)
The location of the estate opposite the village of Dittisham, divided from each other by the River Dart, plays an important part for the alibi and a nightly swim of one of the suspects.

*&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot; (1956)
The boat house of Greenway Estate is described as the spot where the first victim is discovered, and the nearby ferry landing serves as the place where another murder victim is dragged into the water for death by drowning. Other places described are the greenhouse and the tennis court, where Mrs. Oliver placed real clues and red herrings for the &quot;murder hunt&quot;. The lodge of Greenway Estate serves as the home of Amy Folliat, the former owner of Nasse House.

Greenway&#x27;s house and gardens are also used as the setting for Agatha Christie&#x27;s short story &#x27;The Shadow on the Glass&#x27; in the collection &quot;The Mysterious Mr Quin&quot;, first published in 1930, eight years before she bought the estate.

==Popular culture==
ITV&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; episode &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot; was filmed at the house. The estate is the setting for the murder-mystery novel &quot;Death at Greenway&quot;. The author, Anthony Award winner and Mary Higgins Clark Award winner Lori Rader-Day, says she was inspired to write the novel after reading that the estate housed children who were war evacuees during WWII.

<doc id="680412" wikidata="Q733748" url="?curid=680412" title="Tokyo Dome">
<text>is an indoor stadium in Bunkyō, Tokyo, Japan. It was designed as a baseball stadium following its predecessor, Korakuen Stadium (whose former site is now occupied by the Tokyo Dome Hotel and a plaza for this stadium). In Japan, it is often used as a unit of size; for example, &quot;the new construction is five times the size of Tokyo Dome.&quot;

==Construction==
Construction on the stadium began on May 16, 1985, and it opened on March 17, 1988. It was built on the site of the Velodrome, adjacent to Korakuen Stadium and the Koishikawa-Kōrakuen garden. It has a maximum total capacity of 57,000 depending on configuration, with an all-seating configuration of 42,000.

Tokyo Dome&#x27;s original nickname was &quot;The Big Egg&quot;, with some calling it the &quot;Tokyo Big Egg&quot;. Its dome-shaped roof is an air-supported structure, a cable-reinforced 0.8 mm flexible fiberglass membrane supported by slightly pressurizing the inside of the stadium with 150,000 m3/hour using independent blowers. It was developed by Nikken Sekkei and Takenaka Corporation, and modeled after the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.

==History==
It is the home field of the Yomiuri Giants baseball team. On March 18, 1988, the day after Tokyo Dome opened, the Yomiuri Giants held a game which was the first event in Tokyo Dome. The Yomiuri Giants host about 70 games a year at their home stadium, Tokyo Dome, and other Nippon Professional Baseball teams sometimes host several games a year at Tokyo Dome. If the Yomiuri Giants advance to the Climax Series or the Japan Series, additional games will be held at Tokyo Dome. Interleague play, in which the Yomiuri Giants participate, will also be held at Tokyo Dome. In 2021, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows advanced to the Japan Series, but they held the Japan Series at Tokyo Dome instead of their home stadium, Meiji Jingu Stadium. This was because the Japan Series had to be rescheduled due to the spread of COVID-19 infectious disease, and the dates overlapped with the game days of amateur baseball tournaments at Meiji Jingu Stadium. Tokyo Dome is also the location of the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame which chronicles the history of baseball in Japan.

It has also hosted international baseball tournaments such as the World Baseball Classic and WBSC Premier12, Major League Baseball, music concerts, basketball, American football, and association football games, as well as puroresu (pro-wrestling) matches, mixed martial arts events, kickboxing events, and monster truck races. It became the first Japanese venue with an American football attendance above 50,000.

==Tokyo Dome City==
Tokyo Dome is part of a greater entertainment complex known as Tokyo Dome City, built of the grounds of the former Tokyo Koishikawa Arsenal. Tokyo Dome City includes an amusement park and Tokyo Dome City Attractions (formerly Kōrakuen Grounds). This amusement park occupies the former Korakuen Stadium site and includes a roller coaster named Thunder Dolphin and a hubless Ferris wheel. The grounds also have an onsen called Spa LaQua, various shops, restaurants, video game centers, the largest JRA WINS horse race betting complex in Tokyo, and Oft Korakuen, which caters to rural horse races.

==Notable events other than Japanese professional baseball==

===International baseball tournaments and Major League Baseball===
Tokyo Dome has been selected as one of the baseball stadiums to host international baseball tournaments since the 2000s. Tokyo Dome has been selected to host all six World Baseball Classics through 2026. It has also been selected three times to host the WBSC Premier 12 finals.

Tokyo Dome has held various Major League Baseball games to open the seasons, with the first series—a two-game slate between the Chicago Cubs and New York Mets in 2000—being the first time American MLB teams have played regular season games in Asia. Four years later, the New York Yankees, featuring former Yomiuri Giants slugger/outfielder Hideki Matsui in their lineup, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays played two games in the stadium to start the 2004 season. The Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics opened the 2008 MLB season in Japan, and also competed against Japanese teams. To open the 2012 season the Seattle Mariners and the Athletics, the former of which had Ichiro Suzuki, played a two-game series on March 28–29. In game one Seattle – led by Ichiro&#x27;s 4 hits – won 3–1 in 11 innings. The Mariners and Athletics returned to Tokyo Dome for a two-game series to begin the 2019 Major League Baseball season, with Ichiro retiring from professional baseball after the second game. On July 18, 2024, Major League Baseball announced that the 2025 MLB season will open with a two game series March 18-19 at Tokyo Dome between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs.

The event expanded in 2020 to two nights, with the second night on January 5; the event went back to one night in 2024. The event is the biggest in Japanese professional wrestling, and has been compared to WWE&#x27;s flagship U.S. event WrestleMania in terms of size and significance. Other companies such as All Japan Pro Wrestling, Universal Wrestling Federation, Pro Wrestling Noah, and WWE had previously held major events in Tokyo Dome as well.

On June 30, 2024, it was announced that All Elite Wrestling, NJPW, Ring of Honor, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, and Stardom would all be part of a cross-promotional pay-per-view event called Wrestle Dynasty, which took place on January 5, 2025, one day after Wrestle Kingdom 19.

===Boxing===

===American football===

As part of the American Bowl, Tokyo Dome held 13 National Football League preseason games between 1989 and 2005. In the 1996 game between the San Diego Chargers and Pittsburgh Steelers, three Japanese linebackers – Takuro Abe, Shigemasa Ito, and Takahiro Ikenoue of the World League of American Football – became the first Japanese players to participate in an NFL game; Abe and Ito sporadically appeared on special teams for the Chargers, while Ikenoue was part of the Steelers&#x27; defense. 
College football was played 17 straight years in Tokyo, including six years at Tokyo Dome, through the Coca-Cola Classic. In December 1993, the Wisconsin Badgers clinched the Big Ten college football championship and a berth to their first Rose Bowl in 31 years by defeating the Michigan State Spartans 41-20 in the last Coca-Cola Classic, before nearly 52,000 at Tokyo Dome. Ironically, the game was moved from Camp Randall Stadium in Madison so the Badgers&#x27; seniors would get their opportunity to enjoy a bowl game atmosphere.

Tokyo Dome is also the regular home for championship matches for Japan&#x27;s domestic American football leagues, including the professional X-League&#x27;s Japan X Bowl and Rice Bowl.

===Association football===
The first of four &quot;Kick Aids&quot; charity matches was held on April 22, 1988. Pele All-Stars defeated Japan Senior All-Stars 2-0 despite Pele not playing in the match due to a minor injury. Over 48,000 spectators came to the match with ¥8,000,000 raised and went to the Japan Aids Foundation.

=== Figure skating ===
On February 26, 2023, Japanese figure skater and two-time Olympic champion, Yuzuru Hanyu, held a solo ice show titled &quot;Gift&quot; at Tokyo Dome. His show marked the first time that an ice rink was set up at the multipurpose venue, matching the size of an Olympic ice rink with 60m× 30m. The show was directed by Hanyu himself in collaboration with Japanese choreographer Mikiko and performed live with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra among others, having set a new audience record for ice shows with 35,000 spectators. On July 14, 2023, the event was distributed by the American subscription channel Disney+ worldwide.

<text>The Yuwen ( &lt; Eastern Han Chinese: *&quot;waB-mun&quot; &lt; Old Chinese *&quot;waʔ-mən&quot;) is a Chinese compound surname which originated from a pre-state clan of Xianbei ethnicity of Xiongnu origin during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms in China, until its destruction by Former Yan&#x27;s prince Murong Huang in 345. Among the eastern Xianbei clans that ranged from the central part of the present day Liaoning province and eastward, Yuwen clan was the largest, and was awarded the position of the leader of eastern Xianbei (東部大人) by Chinese rulers. A descendant of the Yuwen tribe, Yuwen Tai, established the Northern Zhou Dynasty in the 6th century.



Yuwen were descendants of the nomadic Xiongnu who became assimilated with the Xianbei after 89 CE and ruled the Kumo Xi and Khitan (both Mongolic peoples) before being defeated by Murong Huang in 344 CE, upon which Yuwen separated from the Kumo Xi and Khitan. The language of the Yuwen is thought to be Turkic or a very distant branch of Mongolic. 


== Yuwen tribe ==
Under Yuwen Mona, the son of Yuwen Puhui, the Yuwen tribe moved south from the Yin Mountains and resided in the Liaoxi. By the time of Yuwen Mohuai, the Yuwen had grown into an influential power in the region along with their rival Xianbei tribes, the Murong and Duan. The Yuwen repeatedly fought with the Murong while establishing good relations with the Tuoba tribe in the east through marriage alliances. During the reign of Yuwen Mogui in 302, he claimed the title of Chanyu and boasted a powerful army. That year, he launched a major attack on the Murong but was repelled.

Mogui was succeeded by his son, Yuwen Xiduguan, who expanded the state to the northern desert. In 319, he allied with the Jin dynasty (266–420) Inspector of Pingzhou, Cui Bi to attack the Murong together with the Duan and Goguryeo. After the Duan and Goguryeo were tricked into withdrawing, the Yuwen pressed on and besieged the Murong capital at Jicheng (棘城, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning). However, they suffered a catastrophic defeat in the end, prompting Xiduguan to sue for peace. In 325, his son and successor, Yuwen Qidegui launched another attack on the Murong, but was also defeated.

Qidegui was overthrown by his cousin, Yuwen Yidougui in 333. Later that year, the Murong fell into civil war after Murong Ren rebelled against his chieftain and brother, Murong Huang. The Yuwen, along with the Duan, supported Murong Ren and coordinated attacks against Murong Huang, but was ultimately unsuccessful. After Huang defeated Ren in 336, the Murong began rapidly expanding their power, establishing the Former Yan in 337 and subjugating the Duan, Buyeo and Goguryeo. In 344 (or 345), the Former Yan crushed the Yuwen&#x27;s power base and forced Yidougui to flee, ending their independence.

A son of Yidougui, Yuwen Ling (宇文陵) survived and served under Former Yan and its successor, Later Yan, as an official. After the Later Yan capital, Zhongshan (中山, in modern Baoding, Hebei) fell to the Northern Wei dynasty in 398, he was moved to Wuchuan County in Dai Commandery, where his family would live for generations. One of Yuwen Ling&#x27;s descendants was Yuwen Tai, who laid the foundation of the Northern Zhou dynasty (557–581) for his family to rule.

<text>Sir John Goss (27 December 1800 – 10 May 1880) was an English organist, composer and teacher.

Born to a musical family, Goss was a boy chorister of the Chapel Royal, London, and later a pupil of Thomas Attwood, organist of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. After a brief period as a chorus member in an opera company he was appointed organist of a chapel in south London, later moving to more prestigious organ posts at St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea and finally St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where he struggled to improve musical standards.

As a composer, Goss wrote little for the orchestra, but was known for his vocal music, both religious and secular. Among his best-known compositions are his hymn tunes &quot;Praise, my soul, the King of heaven&quot; and &quot;See, Amid the Winter&#x27;s Snow&quot;. The music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; described him as the last of the line of English composers who confined themselves almost entirely to ecclesiastical music.

From 1827 to 1874, Goss was a professor at the Royal Academy of Music, teaching harmony. He also taught at St Paul&#x27;s. Among his pupils at the academy were Arthur Sullivan, Frederic Cowen and Frederick Bridge. His best-known pupil at St Paul&#x27;s was John Stainer, who succeeded him as organist there.

==Life and career==

===Early years===

Goss came from a musical background. His father, Joseph Goss, was organist of Fareham Parish Church in Hampshire, and earlier members of the family had been celebrated singers. At the age of eight the boy was sent to a school at Ringwood. Three years later he went to London under the care of his uncle, John Jeremiah Goss, an alto singer who sang in the choirs of the Chapel Royal, St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. The young Goss became one of the Children of the Chapel Royal. The master of the choir at that time was John Stafford Smith, a musician known for composing the song &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;, later used as the tune of the American national anthem. As an educator, Smith combined a harsh discipline with a narrow musical curriculum. He confiscated Goss&#x27;s score of Handel&#x27;s organ concertos on the grounds that choristers of the Chapel Royal were there to learn to sing and not to play. Goss later recalled,
When his voice broke in 1816, Goss left the choir and went to live with his uncle. The elder Goss was well known as a teacher, and was at the time teaching James Turle, later organist of Westminster Abbey. The young Goss, however, became a pupil of Thomas Attwood, organist of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Unlike the rigid and harsh Smith, Attwood, a former pupil of Mozart, was a musician of wide sympathies and kind disposition. Mendelssohn called him &quot;dear old Mr. Attwood&quot;, and Goss became devoted to his teacher, under whom he learnt the art of composition and orchestration.

Unable, at first, to secure a post as an organist, Goss earned money by joining the chorus of an opera company. Under the direction of Henry Bishop, he took part in the first performance in England of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; &quot;much tinkered under Bishop&#x27;s direction&quot; at the King&#x27;s Theatre in April 1817.

One of Goss&#x27;s early compositions was a &quot;Negro Song&quot; (1819) for three voices, scored for a small orchestra (strings, flutes, oboes, clarinets, and two horns). Another was a romantic song, &quot;Wert thou like me,&quot; to words by Walter Scott, which Goss dedicated to his fiancée, Lucy Emma Nerd (1800–1895), whom he married in 1821.

===Organist and teacher===

In 1821 Goss married his fiancée Lucy Emma New, and secured an appointment as an organist, at Stockwell Chapel (later known as St. Andrew&#x27;s Church), in south London. He held this post for four years, before winning an open competition for the much more prestigious post of organist at St. Luke&#x27;s, Chelsea, then called Chelsea New Church, in December 1824. The salary was £100 a year, equivalent to more than £80,000 in terms of 2009 incomes.

Goss composed a small amount of orchestral music in this period. Two overtures, in F minor and E flat major, written circa 1824, were performed and published in 1827, with considerable success. He composed incidental music for John Banim&#x27;s melodrama &quot;The Serjeant&#x27;s Wife&quot;, performed at the English Opera House on 24 July 1827. &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s sole comment on the composer&#x27;s contribution was, &quot;The music, which is by Mr. Goss, neither delights nor offends.&quot; Thereafter, Goss avoided orchestral composition, declining a request from the Philharmonic Society of London for another orchestral piece in 1833. As a composer, Goss became known for his vocal music. His solo songs and glees were much performed and were well reviewed in the musical press.

In 1827, while retaining his organ post at Chelsea, Goss became professor of harmony at the Royal Academy of Music, a position he held until 1874. Among his pupils during his 47-year tenure were Arthur Sullivan, Frederic Cowen, Frederick Bridge, and Stephen Kemp. His biographer Judith Blezzard describes Goss as &quot;a distinguished and painstaking teacher, and a tasteful and virtuoso performer on the organ, creating marvellous effects on the then comparatively rudimentary instrument.&quot;
In 1833 Goss entered his anthem, &quot;Have mercy upon me, O God,&quot; in the Gresham Prize Medal competition for the best original composition in sacred vocal music. His work won the prize, beating S. S. Wesley&#x27;s, setting of &quot;The Wilderness&quot;. Goss dedicated his anthem to his old teacher Thomas Attwood; it was performed at the Mansion House in June 1834. Goss&#x27;s other main work of 1833 was his instructional book &quot;An Introduction to Harmony and Thorough-Bass&quot;, which became a standard work and went through 14 editions.

===St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral===

Attwood died in 1838, and Goss hoped to succeed him as organist of St Paul&#x27;s. He sought the advice of the Rev Sydney Smith, canon of St Paul&#x27;s, who teased him by telling him that the salary was only £34 a year. Having a family to support, Goss replied that he might not be able to apply for the post, but Smith then revealed that the post of organist carried with it several additional sources of income, which enabled Goss to reconsider. He was appointed to the post, but immediately found that the organist was employed solely to play the organ, and enjoyed little influence over the other music of the cathedral. Control of the music lay with the Succentor, Canon Beckwith, who was at odds with the Almoner, Canon Hawes, who was responsible for rehearsing the boy choristers. The cathedral authorities were not interested in raising musical standards. Sydney Smith&#x27;s view was typical: &quot;It is enough if our music is decent … we are there to pray, and the singing is a very subordinate consideration.&quot; Some of Smith&#x27;s colleagues were indifferent to both considerations, there being frequent absenteeism by the junior clergy, neglecting their duties and failing to conduct services.

Goss was noted for his piety and gentleness of character. His pupil, John Stainer, wrote, &quot;That Goss was a man of religious life was patent to all who came into contact with him, but an appeal to the general effect of his sacred compositions offers public proof of the fact.&quot; His mildness was a disadvantage when attempting to deal with his recalcitrant singers. He was unable to do anything about the laziness of the tenors and basses, who had lifetime security of tenure and were uninterested in learning new music. The biographer Jeremy Dibble writes, &quot;Hostility to [Goss&#x27;s] fine anthem &#x27;Blessed is the man&#x27;, composed in 1842, undermined his confidence so markedly that he did not compose any further anthems until 1852, when he was commissioned to write two anthems for the state funeral of the Duke of Wellington. Those new anthems were &quot;If we believe that Jesus died&quot; and &quot;And the King said&quot;; the latter being written so that it moved seamlessly into Handel&#x27;s Dead March in Saul, a combination which Prince Albert reported &quot;had made everyone weep&quot;. Goss also composed for the service an Anglican chant for the Nunc dimittis, based on Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7.

Stainer who was a boy chorister at the time of Wellington&#x27;s funeral later recalled the effect of Goss&#x27;s music at rehearsal: &quot;When the last few bars &quot;pianissimo&quot; had died away, there was a profound silence for some time, so deeply had the hearts of all been touched by its truly devotional spirit. Then there gradually arose on all sides the warmest congratulation to the composer, it could hardly be termed &quot;applause&quot;, for it was something much more genuine and respectful.&quot; Stainer was not always so reverential about his teacher. He later recalled the occasion on which he and the young Arthur Sullivan succumbed to laughter when Goss absent-mindedly walked across the pedals of the organ during a service &quot;before he realised that he was the cause of the alarming thunderings which were frightening the congregation and putting a temporary pause in the sermon.&quot;

===Later years===
In 1861, to raise funds for a new organ at St Paul&#x27;s Goss set up and conducted a performance of &quot;Messiah&quot;, the first oratorio to be performed in St Paul&#x27;s. In the Victorian style, the performance was on a large scale, with 600 performers.

In the early 1870s Goss&#x27;s health began to fail. By 1872 he had decided to retire, and his swan-song at St Paul&#x27;s was in February of that year at the national service of thanksgiving for the recovery of the Prince of Wales from a grave illness. For this service he composed a setting of the &quot;Te Deum&quot; and an anthem, &quot;The Lord is my strength&quot;. In the following month he handed over his post at St Paul&#x27;s to his former pupil Stainer.

Goss died at his home in Brixton, south London at the age of 79. His funeral service was held in St Paul&#x27;s, and he was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.

===Honours and memorials===
Goss was knighted on his retirement, and, together with Sullivan, he received an honorary doctorate in music at the University of Cambridge in 1876.

A memorial was erected to Goss in St Paul&#x27;s in 1886; beneath a bas-relief by Hamo Thornycroft is the opening of Goss&#x27;s &quot;If we believe,&quot; the anthem sung at his funeral service in the cathedral. A century after Goss&#x27;s death the Fareham Society added a blue plaque to his former home.

==Works==

In the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, W. H. Husk and Bruce Carr write of Goss, &quot;His glees enjoyed long popularity for their grateful vocal writing. As a church composer his reputation came later, through the grace and the careful word-setting of his anthems, composed mostly after 1850.&quot; They quote a contemporary as saying that Goss&#x27;s music &quot;is always melodious and beautifully written for the voices, and is remarkable for a union of solidity and grace, with a certain unaffected native charm.&quot; Judith Blezzard, in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, writes:

Blezzard adds that Goss is chiefly remembered for his two most famous hymn tunes: &quot;Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven&quot; (1869) and &quot;See, Amid the Winter&#x27;s Snow&quot; (1871).

In the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; in 1890, J A Fuller Maitland wrote, &quot;The best of Goss&#x27;s works are distinguished by much grace and sweetness, underlying which is a solid foundation of theoretic and contrapuntal science. It is difficult to resist the assumption that at least some part of this happy combination was inherited, through Attwood, from Mozart. Goss was the last of the illustrious line of English composers who confined themselves almost entirely to ecclesiastical music.&quot; Among Goss&#x27;s works, Fuller Maitland singled out for particular praise the glee &quot;Ossian&#x27;s Hymn to the Sun&quot;, and the anthems &quot;The Wilderness,&quot; &quot;O taste and see,&quot; and &quot;O Saviour of the World&quot;.

<text>John Alsop King (January 3, 1788July 7, 1867) was an American politician who was the twentieth governor of New York from 1857 to 1858. He was the 1st Republican governor of New York.

==Life==
King was born in the area now encompassed by New York City on January 3, 1788, to U.S. senator Rufus King (1755–1827) and Mary (née Alsop) King. His maternal grandparents were John Alsop (1724–1794), a prominent merchant and Mary Frogat (1744–1772). John A. King was part of the King family of Massachusetts and New York through his mother.

He had four younger brothers, including Charles King (1789–1867), who was President of Columbia University, and Congressman James G. King (1791–1853), Edward King (1795–1836) and Frederic Gore King (1802–1829).

When his father was appointed the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain, the family moved to Britain, and King was educated at Harrow School. Upon graduating from Harrow, King returned to New York City to study law. He was admitted to the bar and practiced in New York City.

==Career==
John King&#x27;s law career was interrupted by a stint in the military; he served as a cavalry lieutenant in the War of 1812. After the war, however, he returned to his law practice and then ventured into politics. King was a member of the New York State Assembly (Queens Co.) in 1819, 1820 and 1820–21; of the New York State Senate (First D.) in 1823; and again of the State Assembly in 1832, 1838 and 1840.

He was president of the New York State Agricultural Society in 1849.

===United States Congress===
King was elected as a Whig to the 31st United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1851. His term as Governor of New York from 1857 to 1858 was noted for improvements to the State&#x27;s education system and the enlargement of the Erie Canal.

=== Governor of New York ===
Following a series of attacks (the so-called Quarantine War of 1858) on the quarantine facility on Staten Island, King dispatched several units of the New York State Militia to briefly occupy the island.

=== Presidential Elector ===
In the 1860 presidential election, when the Republicans won New York, King was elected a presidential elector and voted for Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin.

==Personal life==
He was married to Mary Ray (1790–1873), daughter of Cornelius and Elizabeth Elmendorf Ray. Together, John and Mary had:

* Mary King (1810–1894), who married Phineas Miller Nightingale (1803–1873)
* Charles Ray King (1813–1901), who married Hannah Wharton Fisher (1816–1870) in 1839. After her death, he married her sister, Nancy Wharton Fisher (1826–1905) in 1872.
* Elizabeth Ray King (1815–1900), who married Henry Bell Van Rensselaer (1810–1864), a United States Congressman and member of the Van Rensselaer family.
* John Alsop King Jr. (1817–1900), a state senator who married Mary Colden Rhinelander (1818–1894), granddaughter of Josiah Ogden Hoffman (1766–1837)
* Caroline King (1820–1900), who married her first cousin, James Gore King Jr. (1819–1867), son of James G. King
* Richard King (1822–1891), who married Elizabeth Lewis (1822–1891), daughter of Mordecai Lewis in 1839
* Cornelia King (1824–1897)
* Ellen King (1825–1827)

King died on July 7, 1867, in Queens County, New York, and was buried at the Grace Church Cemetery in Jamaica, Queens.

<doc id="680430" wikidata="Q855401" url="?curid=680430" title="Júbilo Iwata">
<text>is a Japanese professional football team based in Iwata, located in Shizuoka Prefecture. The club competes in J2 League following relegation from J1 League in 2024.

== Etymology ==
The team&#x27;s name &quot;Júbilo&quot; means &#x27;joy&#x27; in Spanish and Portuguese.

== History ==

=== Origins and rise to the top (1972–1996) ===

The team started out as the company team for Yamaha Motor Corporation in April 1972. After making its way through the Shizuoka and Tōkai football leagues, it played in the Japan Soccer League until it reorganized as the J.League at the end of 1992.

Their first glory happened when they won both the Emperor&#x27;s Cup and promotion as champions of the JSL Division 2 in 1982. They won their first Japanese league title in the 1987/88 season. Due to problems in the upcoming professionalization, Yamaha decided to relegate themselves and not be one of the J.League founder members.

They finished in 2nd place of the JFL 1st division, a division below the top flight, in 1993 and were promoted to the J1 league for 1994. The team welcomed Marius Johan Ooft as its manager, as well as the Brazil national team captain Dunga and a number of foreign players to build a winning team. Dunga&#x27;s football philosophy deeply influenced the club, initially as a player and currently as an advisor.

=== Glory years (1997–2003) ===
In a seven-year period between 1997 and 2003, the club won a number of titles relying on Japanese players instead of foreigners who may leave on a transfer during the middle of the season. Within this period Júbilo won the J.League title three times, finished second three more and won each of the domestic cup competitions once. In 1999, Júbilo were also crowned Champions of Asia after winning the final match against Esteghlal in front of 121,000 spectators at the Azadi Stadium.

In one of the most fruitful periods in J.League history, Júbilo broke several records and created some new ones. Amongst these are the most goals scored in a season (107 in 1998); the fewest goals conceded in a season (26 in 2001); the biggest goal difference (plus 68 goals in 1998); and the largest win (9–1 against Cerezo Osaka in 1998). In 2002, the team won both stages of the championship, a first in J.League history, and the same year the team had a record seven players selected for the J.League Team of the Year. All of these records still stand today.

Between 1997 and 2003, Júbilo were one of the most successful teams in the J. League. Over this seven-year spell Jubilo finished outside the top two of J1 just once, winning the league title on three occasions. This period also saw a number of cup final appearances, including winning the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, the J. League Cup, and the Asian Champions League once each.

=== Post-glory years (2003–2015) ===
Since their last cup triumph in the 2003 Emperor&#x27;s Cup, the squad which took them to such heights began to age. Without similarly skilled replacements coming through the youth team or from outside, Júbilo&#x27;s power started to fade, and in 2007 the club ended the season in a record worst position of 9th. Perhaps more concerning to Júbilo supporters is their eclipse in recent seasons by bitter local rivals Shimizu S-Pulse who, in ending the season above Júbilo every year since 2006, have become Shizuoka prefecture&#x27;s premier performing team. In 2008 they finished 16th out of 18 – their lowest position in the 18-club table – but kept their J1 position by defeating Vegalta Sendai in the promotion/relegation playoff.

In 2013 season, it took them until 8th week to make their first win in the league matches, and never move up higher than 16th since they were ranked down to 17th as of the end of 5th week. Then eventually suffered their first relegation to 2014 J.League Division 2 after they were defeated by Sagan Tosu at their 31st week match.
Júbilo were promoted back to J1 in 2015 after finishing runners-up.

=== Yo-yo era (2019–&quot;present&quot;) ===

After an 18th-place finish in 2019, Iwata were relegated to J2 for 2020. The following year, Júbilo won J2 and were promoted for the 2022 J1 League season.

In 2022, Júbilo couldn&#x27;t find their way into success throughout the season, with forgettable campaigns being made in each competition. In the J.League Cup, the team saw an early elimination at the group stage, finishing third at their group after losing half of their fixtures. In the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, they were eliminated in the Round of 16 by Tokyo Verdy at extra-time, despite looking promising after 5–2 win against Matsumoto Yamaga on the 2nd round.

On 19 October 2022, Júbilo Iwata announced through their media accounts that for both transfers windows of the 2023 season, the club would be unable to make new signings after a ban was imposed by FIFA and the CAS. The ban, however, didn&#x27;t applied to youth team promotions of Júbilo&#x27;s academy system, and for players returning from loan transfers. The decision was made based on issues regarding Fabián González&#x27;s contract with the club, as the player supposedly cancelled a contract signed with an unnamed Thai club without a justifiable reason. According to Júbilo, at the time of his signing (in the pre-season) they were unaware of the previous contract González signed with the Thai club. The situation became public after the Thai club left a complaint highlighting the transfer issue situation to FIFA&#x27;s Dispute Resolution Chamber in April 2022. González was also imposed a punishment by FIFA, being suspended from any participation in official matches for four months. The transfer ban also led to a provisional contract cancellation of Shu Morooka on 17 November 2022, who had during the season signed a provisional contract for the 2023 season, after graduating from university. Then, on the same day, it was announced he would join Kashima Antlers instead. Later on 20 December, the club filed an appeal about the CAS decision over the subject, but it was denied on 22 December.

The situation in J1 became much worse for the club, spending the last 16 rounds of the top-flight league without leaving relegation zone, resulted another drop to J2 League for 2023 season, which confirmed on the penultimate round. Nonetheless, just a year later, Iwata eventually made a swift return to J1 for the 2024 season by finishing as runners-up of the second-tier, obtained a 2–1 away win in the final matchweek of the season against Tochigi SC on 12 November 2023 and favoured by results of another matches in the same day. On 1 March 2024, Ryo Germain scored 4 goals in a memorable 5–4 league away win against Kawasaki Frontale.

==Rivalries==

The fiercest professional rivals of Júbilo Iwata are Shimizu S-Pulse from Shizuoka. The club also have rivalries with both Kashima Antlers and Yokohama Marinos, with whom they traded the Japanese league championship since the late 1980s. During the Japan Soccer League days, they had a more local derby with Honda, across the Tenryu in Hamamatsu, but as Honda has long resisted professionalism, competitive matches between them since 1994 are a rarity. Júbilo also competed with another Shizuoka club, Fujieda MYFC in 2014 Emperor&#x27;s Cup as well as 2023 J2 League, all won by Iwata side. On J3 League, there are Azul Claro Numazu, although neither clubs have ever faced one another in a competitive match.

== Stadium ==
Júbilo plays their home games at the Yamaha Stadium. The stadium has a seating capacity of 15,165 people. It is one of the few dedicated football stadiums in Japan that are operated and managed by the club. It is said to be the easiest place to watch a game in Japan.

For big fixtures such as the Shizuoka Derby with Shimizu S-Pulse and against some of the top teams in J1, Júbilo would play at the much larger Ecopa Stadium in Fukuroi City, a venue built specifically for the 2002 FIFA World Cup finals. The stadium surrounded by the rich nature of Mt. Ogasa and full of greenery, is the largest multi-purpose stadium in the prefecture, boasting a fully equipped facility that can accommodate 50,000 people.

Júbilo use both Okubo Ground in Iwata and Iwata Sports Park Yumeria as training grounds.

<text>Rupert Holmes (born David Goldstein; February 24, 1947) is a British-American composer, singer-songwriter, dramatist and author. He is widely known for the hit singles &quot;Escape (The Piña Colada Song)&quot; (1979) and &quot;Him&quot; (1980). He is also known for his musicals &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, which earned him two Tony Awards, and &quot;Curtains&quot;, his AMC television series &quot;Remember WENN&quot;, and his novel &quot;Murder Your Employer: The McMasters Guide to Homicide&quot;.

==Life and career==
Holmes was born David Goldstein in Northwich, Cheshire, England. His father, Leonard Eliot Goldstein, was a United States Army warrant officer and bandleader. His mother, Gwendolen Mary (&quot;née&quot; Pynn), was English, and both were musical. Holmes has dual British and American citizenship. The family moved when Holmes was six years old to the northern New York City suburb of Nanuet, New York, where Holmes grew up and attended nearby Nyack High School and then the Manhattan School of Music (majoring in clarinet). Holmes&#x27;s brother, Richard, a principal lyric baritone with the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, has sung roles with regional opera companies, such as Glimmerglass, Lake George and Virginia Opera, and has appeared with the Metropolitan Opera.

In 1969, Holmes married childhood friend Elizabeth &quot;Liza&quot; Wood Dreifuss, an attorney. Their daughter Wendy died suddenly in 1986, at the age of ten, of an undiagnosed brain tumor. They have two sons: Nick, a filmmaker, and Timothy, who is autistic. In 2009, they moved from Scarsdale, New York, where they had lived since Wendy&#x27;s death, to Cold Spring, New York.

===Songwriter and recording artist===
In his 20s, Holmes was a session musician (producing sessions, writing and arranging songs, singing and playing a few instruments). In 1969, Holmes and Ron Dante of the Cuff Links (and the Archies) recorded &quot;Jennifer Tomkins&quot; for release on their second album, &quot;The Cuff Links&quot;. During the recording of that album, Dante was prohibited by the studio that produced the Archies from any involvement in new recording ventures and was forced to drop out of the Cuff Links. Holmes finished the project and released &quot;Jennifer Tomkins&quot; separately under a different studio name, Street People (not related to the mid-1970s band the Street People). The song was on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 15 weeks, beginning January 3, 1970, reaching a peak of number 36. In Canada the song reached number 21. A follow-up single called &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; reached number 96 on the Billboard pop charts in April 1970.

Holmes played the piano for both the Cuff Links and the Buoys, with whom he had his first international hit, &quot;Timothy&quot;, which was on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks beginning on January 2, 1971, a number 17 song about human cannibalism that intentionally drew controversy. He also wrote &quot;Give Up Your Guns&quot; (which peaked at number 84), &quot;The Prince of Thieves&quot;, &quot;Blood Knot&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; for the band. Holmes also wrote jingles and pop tunes (including for Gene Pitney, the Platters, the Drifters, Wayne Newton, Dolly Parton, Barry Manilow and television&#x27;s the Partridge Family), as well as the score of the 1970 revenge western &quot;Five Savage Men&quot; (also known as &quot;The Animals&quot;), which starred Keenan Wynn.

As a recording artist, Holmes broke through with his first album, 1974&#x27;s &quot;Widescreen&quot; on Epic Records, which introduced him as a presenter of highly romantic, lushly orchestrated &quot;story songs&quot; that told a witty narrative punctuated by clever rhymes and a hint of comedy. Barbra Streisand discovered this album and asked to record songs from it, launching Holmes on a successful career. She then used some of his songs in the movie &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. Holmes also arranged, conducted, and wrote songs on her 1975 album &quot;Lazy Afternoon&quot; as well as five other Streisand albums. Holmes&#x27;s second, self-titled album led &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to compare him with Bob Dylan as an artist of unprecedented originality who commanded attention.

Holmes&#x27;s production skills were also in demand during this period, and he took on this role for Lynsey de Paul&#x27;s album &quot;Tigers and Fireflies&quot;, which spawned the radio hit &quot;Hollywood Romance&quot;. The album also featured the bluesy song &quot;&#x27;Twas&quot;, co-written by Holmes and de Paul. He additionally produced Sparks&#x27; 1976 LP, &quot;Big Beat&quot;, though the album was not a success. In 1975, together with Jeffrey Lesser, Holmes produced the UK band Sailor&#x27;s album &quot;Trouble&quot; (CBS Epic).

&quot;Escape (The Piña Colada Song)&quot; was on Holmes&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, and was the final Hot 100 number 1 of 1979. Another popular song on that album was &quot;Him&quot;, which peaked at number 6 on the Hot 100. Holmes had another top-40 hit with &quot;Answering Machine&quot;. In 1986, Holmes&#x27;s composition &quot;You Got It All&quot; (sometimes called &quot;You Got It All Over Him&quot;) was a top 3 hit single for the Jets; it was later recorded by Britney Spears and featured in her internationally released version of &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; (2000). His song &quot;The People That You Never Get to Love&quot; was featured on four albums by Susannah McCorkle: &quot;The People That You Never Get to Love&quot; (1981), &quot;From Bessie to Brazil&quot; (1993), &quot;Most Requested Songs&quot; (2001), and &quot;Ballad Essentials&quot; (2002). Frank Sinatra Jr. also recorded the tune on his 2006 album &quot;That Face!&quot;

In the 1980s and 1990s, Holmes also played in cabarets and comedy clubs, mostly in New York City, telling often autobiographical anecdotes illustrated with his songs. In 2021, Holmes received an honorary Doctor of Musical Arts degree from the Manhattan School of Music.

===Playwright===
Holmes made his professional debut as a playwright with the musical &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; in 1985. Joseph Papp and his wife encouraged Holmes to write a musical after they attended one of his cabarets in 1983. The result, loosely based on Charles Dickens&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, and inspired by Holmes&#x27;s memories of English pantomime shows he attended as a child, was a hit in New York&#x27;s Central Park and on Broadway. Because Dickens left the novel unfinished at his death, Holmes employed the unusual device of providing alternate endings for each character suspected of the murder, and letting the audience vote on a different murderer each night. The show earned Holmes the Tony Award for both book and score, as well as the Drama Desk Awards for lyrics, music, the book and orchestrations, among various other honors. The musical has been given London and Broadway revivals, among others. &quot;Drood&quot; success led Holmes to write other plays (both musical and non-) in later years, though he has said that he avoided musical theater for some time after his daughter&#x27;s death.

Holmes also wrote the Tony Award-nominated (&quot;Best Play 2003&quot;) &quot;Say Goodnight, Gracie&quot;, based on the relationship between George Burns and Gracie Allen. The play, which starred Frank Gorshin, was that Broadway season&#x27;s longest-running play and the third-longest-running solo-performance show in Broadway history. He wrote the comedy-thriller &quot;Accomplice&quot; in 1990, the second of Holmes&#x27;s plays to receive an Edgar Award (after &quot;Drood&quot;). Holmes has written a number of other shows, including &quot;Solitary Confinement&quot;, which played on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre in 1992 and set a new Kennedy Center box office record before its Broadway run; &quot;Thumbs&quot;, the most successful play in the history of the Helen Hayes Theatre Company; and the musical &quot;Marty&quot; (2002), starring John C. Reilly. He wrote the book to &quot;Swango: The Theatrical Dance Experience&quot;, a swing-tango dance piece that premiered Off-Broadway in 2002 inspired by &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. It has had several revivals. Holmes joined the creative team of the musical &quot;Curtains&quot; after the deaths of both Peter Stone (the original book-writer) and Fred Ebb (the lyricist). Holmes rewrote Stone&#x27;s original book and contributed additional lyrics to the Kander and Ebb songs. &quot;Curtains&quot; played at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on Broadway, with David Hyde Pierce and Debra Monk in the lead roles. Holmes and Peter Stone (posthumously) won the 2007 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical for &quot;Curtains&quot;.

Holmes wrote the book of the musical &quot;The First Wives&#x27; Club&quot;, adapted from the film &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;. The musical premiered at The Old Globe Theater in San Diego, California in 2009. Its score is by Lamont Dozier, Brian Holland and Eddie Holland. The production received generally unenthusiastic reviews but sold well. Linda Bloodworth-Thomason wrote a new book, and the reworked show opened in Chicago in 2015. Holmes next wrote the book for a jukebox musical, &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot;, inspired by the 1964 film &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; starring Frank Sinatra, with a new story line that Holmes set in 1962. Songs are by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, including &quot;My Kind of Town&quot;. A production ran in 2010, also at the Old Globe. Casey Nicholaw directed and choreographed. The story is about a likable gangster hoping to get out of the crime business. A do-gooder TV reporter likens him to a modern-day Robin Hood.

Holmes adapted the John Grisham novel and film &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; for the stage. The play premiered at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in 2011. The courtroom drama, set against a background of evolving 1980s Southern racial politics, was called &quot;funny, shocking, witty, and sly&quot;. He wrote the book and lyrics for &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, a musical based on the 1963 film &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;. Marvin Hamlisch wrote the score. The musical was directed by Jerry Lewis and premiered in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2012. With Hamlisch, he also wrote songs for the 2013 Liberace biopic &quot;Behind the Candelabra&quot;. He next wrote the book of &quot;Secondhand Lions: A New Musical&quot;, which premiered in Seattle, Washington, in 2013. &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; was produced on Broadway, but lasted only four weeks plus previews, closing on November 17, 2013. In 2016, &quot;The Sweet Potato Queens&quot;, with music by Melissa Manchester, lyrics by Sharon Vaughn and a book by Holmes, premiered at TUTS Underground.

===Television writer and novelist===
In 1996, Holmes created the television series &quot;Remember WENN&quot; for American Movie Classics, writing the theme song and writing or co-writing all but one of the 56 episodes of that series. In 2003, he published his first novel, &quot;Where the Truth Lies&quot; (later adapted into the film &quot;Where the Truth Lies&quot; by Atom Egoyan), followed in 2005 by &quot;Swing&quot;, a multimedia release combining a novel with a music CD providing clues to the mystery. His next novel, &quot;Murder Your Employer: The McMasters Guide to Homicide&quot; (2023); peaked at number six on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for hardcover fiction on March 12, 2023.

<text>Mutant Aliens is a 2001 American adult animated science-fiction-comedy film directed and written by Bill Plympton. &quot;Mutant Aliens&quot; has shown at a number of animation festivals, but has never had a wide theatrical release.

==Plot==
After leaving his 5-years old daughter Josie, astronaut of the USA goverment Earl Jensen is stranded in space intentionally by the head of the Department of Space. Years later, he returns to Earth. To gain the people&#x27;s trust, he tells the story of the time he has spent on a planet inhabited by humanoid aliens with animal body parts. Jensen later tells he has a interest in crossbreeding the aliens to create an army of mutants, in order to exact his revenge on the Department of Space head.

== Production ==
The film was fully made at Plympton´s studio in New York City Plymptoons and is a spoof of B monster movies, featuring Plympton&#x27;s own distinctive animation style consisting in hand-drawn animation made using colored pencils with backgrounds painted in brushes and gratuitous sex and violence.

<text>Sir John Robert Steell (Aberdeen 18 September 1804 – 15 September 1891) was a Scottish sculptor. He modelled many of the leading figures of Scottish history and culture, and is best known for a number of sculptures displayed in Edinburgh, including the statue of Sir Walter Scott at the base of the Scott Monument.

==Biography==
Steell was born in Aberdeen, but his family moved to 5 Calton Hill in Edinburgh in 1806. He was one of the thirteen children (eleven surviving beyond infancy) of John Steell senior (1779–1849), a carver and gilder, and his wife, Margaret Gourlay, the daughter of William Gourlay, a Dundee shipbuilder. As the family grew they moved to a larger house at 20 Calton Hill. Due to his father&#x27;s own fame as a sculptor, for much of his early working career he is referred to as John Steel Junior.

Steell initially followed his father, training to be a carver himself, being apprenticed in 1818. In 1819 his father was declared bankrupt by the Trades of Calton, bringing much shame on the family. However, John Junior showed artistic talent, and despite this, the family sent him to study art at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh, under Andrew Wilson.

Working with his father from studios at 6 Hanover Street, his first major step came in 1827 when the North British Fire Insurance Company, at 1 Hanover Street, commissioned a huge timber statue of St Andrew to be placed on the outside of their office. now housed within the Lodge Room premises of Lodge Dalkeith Kilwinning in Dalkeith. The work appears closely based on a sketch of a statue of St Andrew in Rome by François Duquesnoy. As the office stood immediately opposite the Royal Scottish Academy it was quickly noticed by Edinburgh&#x27;s artistic society, and acknowledged as a fine work. In 1829, spurred on by the success of this work, he travelled to Rome to study sculpture more intensely.

The first work to attract international attention was &quot;Alexander taming Bucephalus&quot; carved in 1832–33 (cast in bronze in 1883, and now standing in the quadrangle of Edinburgh City Chambers). Around 1838 he was appointed as Sculptor to Her Majesty the Queen, a post which was later recognised as part of the Royal Household in Scotland. In 1840 he opened Scotland&#x27;s first foundry on Grove Street in Edinburgh, dedicated to sculpture, to cast his statue of Wellington himself.

In 1854 he commissioned a new house for himself at 24 Greenhill Gardens and lived there for the rest of his life. His fame by then was international, receiving commissions from the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Prior to this he had lived at 3 Randolph Place on the edge of the Moray Estate in Edinburgh&#x27;s West End.

He exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy, and was knighted in 1876 following the unveiling, by Queen Victoria, of his statue &quot;The Prince Consort&quot;, which stands in the centre of Charlotte Square in Edinburgh.

Steell died at home, 24 Greenhill Gardens in Edinburgh&#x27;s southern suburbs, on 15 September 1891 and is buried in an unmarked grave in Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Calton Cemetery. This grave was purchased by his father John Steell senior and many members of the Steell and Gourlay families are also interred there.

==Family==
In 1826 he married Elizabeth Graham, daughter of John Graham, an Edinburgh merchant.

His eldest son, William Steell (1836–1917), appears to have been an architect but of minimal note. One of his few recorded works is the pedestal for John&#x27;s statue of Dr Thomas Chalmers on George Street in Edinburgh.

His youngest son, Graham Steell was a prominent British physician and cardiologist who is best known for identifying the cardiac murmur that bears his name.

Sir John Steell&#x27;s brother Gourlay Steell was a noted animal painter: he was Queen Victoria&#x27;s animal painter, taking over from Sir Edwin Landseer. Many of Gourlay Steell&#x27;s paintings remain in the private collection of Queen Elizabeth II. His portrait was painted by Robert Scott Lauder and William Grant Stevenson (Aberdeen Art Gallery).

<text>The 1st New Zealand Special Air Service Regiment, abbreviated as 1 NZSAS Regt, is the special forces unit of the New Zealand Army, closely modelled on the British Special Air Service (SAS). It was formed on 7 July 1955. It traces its origins to the Second World War and the famous Long Range Desert Group that New Zealanders served with.

The New Zealand Government states that NZSAS is the &quot;premier combat unit of the New Zealand Defence Force&quot;
and it has been operationally deployed to locations including the Pacific region, Afghanistan, and the jungles of South-East Asia. Individual members of the NZSAS have received honours and awards, most notably the Victoria Cross for New Zealand awarded to Corporal Willie Apiata. In 2004, the unit was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation for its contribution in Afghanistan.

The NZSAS was accorded regimental status in 2013. It has the responsibility of conducting counter-terrorism and overseas special operations and performing the disposal of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive hazards for military and civilian authorities.

== History ==
The NZSAS can trace its roots back to the famous Long Range Desert Group, a British/Commonwealth army unit which fought in the North African desert in World War II. New Zealanders also served in the original Special Air Service force during World . In February 1955, it was decided by the New Zealand Government that a squadron based on the British Special Air Service should be formed as part of the New Zealand Army, as an effective and economic contribution to the Far East Strategic Reserve and the British counter-insurgency effort in Malaya. Major Frank Rennie was appointed to form and command the unit, with the decision having been made to recruit mainly from the general public around a cadre of Regular Force personnel. Over 800 applied, from which 182, including 138 civilians (though 101 had previous military experience) were selected for training beginning in June 1955. In late 1957, soon after the squadron&#x27;s return to New Zealand from Malaya, the unit was disbanded, having been operationally replaced by an infantry battalion. The NZSAS was re-established in October 1959, with the unit celebrating its 50th Jubilee from 3–12 June 2005.

The NZSAS were granted the Freedom of the Borough of Thames on 27 September 1967.

As part of changes the NZDF&#x27;s command structure, the 1st New Zealand Special Air Service Regiment was transferred to the command of the new Special Operations Component Command(New Zealand) on 1 July 2015 

=== Unit location ===
When the unit was first established in 1955, prior to the departure to Malaya all training was conducted at Waiouru Military Camp. Upon re-establishment of the squadron in October 1959, it was based at Papakura Military Camp, until the unit was relocated to Hobsonville Air Force Base in the mid-1990s, however the NZSAS Counter-Terrorism and demolitions training facilities remained at Papakura and Ardmore Military Camps. In 2001–2002 a new facility for the unit was built at Papakura Military Camp. The facility was named &#x27;Rennie Lines&#x27;, after the founding NZSAS Commanding Officer Major Frank Rennie and officially opened on 14 December 2002. The Battle Training Facility (BTF) was officially opened on 8 April 2016 in the Ardmore Military Training Area for counter-terrorist training to replace facilities over 30 years old.

=== Unit designation ===
On 1 May 1955, after the Cabinet had given its approval the &#x27;New Zealand Special Air Service Squadron&#x27; was formally established. From 24 August 1963 the unit was renamed to &#x27;1 Ranger Squadron New Zealand Special Air Service&#x27;, in recognition of the &#x27;Forest Rangers&#x27; who fought in the New Zealand Wars being one of New Zealand&#x27;s first Special Forces units. The unit reverted to &#x27;1st New Zealand Special Air Service Squadron&#x27; on 1 April 1978. From 1 January 1985 the unit was known as &#x27;1st New Zealand Special Air Services Group&#x27; until its re-designation as a Regiment before February 2013.

=== Dress distinctions ===
When the unit was established in 1955, approval was given for members to wear a maroon beret. The maroon beret was chosen as it was the then colour of the British Special Air Service beret. However, the British changed their beret colour to ecru (sandy-coloured) in late 1957, the same colour as had been worn by the SAS during the early stages of World . On 19 December 1985, approval was granted by the (then) New Zealand chief of general staff, Major General John Mace, who had previously deployed to Malaya with the original NZSAS Squadron, for the NZSAS to switch from maroon to the sandy-coloured beret worn by other Commonwealth Special Air Service units. A parade was held on 21 March 1986 to formally hand the new beret over to the unit.

To show the close association between the NZSAS and the British Special Air Service, members of NZSAS are authorised to wear black rank on all orders of dress except mess dress and to wear black web belts whenever web belts are ordered to be worn.

== Operational deployments ==
=== Malaya 1955–57 ===
On 20 November 1955 the NZSAS Squadron departed from New Zealand and after completing parachute training in Changi, Singapore, a 133-strong NZSAS Squadron was attached to the British SAS in Malaya. After undertaking jungle training in the rugged mountains of Perak, the squadron went on to spend approximately 18 of the 24 months it was in Malaya operating in the jungle to fight against pro-independence guerrillas of the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP).

SAS operations in Malaya consisted of going deep into the jungle, locating local people and moving them for their protection, then seeking out MNLA guerrillas in the area and &#x27;destroying&#x27; them. From 2 April 1956 when the New Zealand Squadron became operational it was deployed to the Fort Brooke area, bordering the states of Perak and Kelantan. From late 1956 the squadron operated in the &#x27;mountainous&#x27; area of Negri Sembilan, between the towns of Seremban, Kuala Pilah, and Tampin. In both locations the squadron was involved in successful operations eliminating the local MNLA groups. During the two-year tour New Zealand patrols were involved in 14 separate engagements with the MNLA, killing fifteen, capturing one and taking the surrender of nine others. The squadron suffered two fatalities. On 2 May 1956 while patrolling, Trooper A.R. Thomas was fatally wounded, and on 11 May 1957 Corporal A.G. Buchanan died of heat stroke while on patrol. The squadron returned home in December 1957. Within the NZSAS, they are known as &#x27;the Originals&#x27;.

=== Thailand 1962 ===
At the request of the Royal Thai Government a detachment of 30 men were stationed in Thailand from 2 June to 16 September 1962 during the Laotian crisis. The detachment was split into two Troops, with one working with United States Special Forces and the Marines at Udon in the north-east and the other deployed with a reinforced United States Army battle group at Khao in the central region. Neither Troop took part in any operations involving action against the enemy, but the deployment provided the detachment with an opportunity to train in jungle and mounted operations while working with American and Thai forces.

=== Borneo 1965–66 ===
In late 1964, during the Indonesian Confrontation (Konfrontasi) in West Malaysia, the New Zealand Government authorised the deployment of a New Zealand Special Air Service detachment to assist with countering Indonesian Communist insurgents in Borneo. The unit was deployed alongside its British and Australian Special Air Service counterparts. The Detachments served under the operational command of the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment and were employed on reconnaissance tasks and ambushing operations including CLARET operations. These involved crossing the border into Indonesia to gain intelligence information and later deter the Indonesians from infiltrating across the border into Borneo.

In February 1965, the first detachment of 40 men under the command of Major W.J.D. (Bill) Meldrum, known as 1 Detachment, 1st Ranger Squadron, New Zealand Special Air Service, departed for Malaysia. However, as a result of a perceived operational security breach Meldrum was replaced by Major Brian Worsnop from 3 April 1965. After a period of training with 22 SAS, 1 Detachment inserted its initial patrols on 8 April 1965. 1 Detachment carried out patrols, stopping for a training break from June to July 1965, until it was replaced by 2 Detachment on 11 October 1965. 2 Detachment was commanded by Major Rod Dearing and again composed of 40 men. It performed similar tasks to 1 Detachment; 2 Detachment&#x27;s later patrols were conducted in the Sabah area, &quot;particularly rugged, steep and rocky&quot;. The detachment was withdrawn from operations on 10 February 1966, and was replaced by 3 Detachment which was commanded by Major David Ogilvy, who had previously deployed to Malaya with the original NZSAS Squadron. 3 Detachment conducted patrols from February, with the Detachment&#x27;s last patrol conducted over the period 16 to 28 May 1966, which was also the last CLARET patrol conducted by the NZSAS. 4 Detachment arrived in Borneo in June 1966 under the command of Major David Moloney, just after CLARET operations had been stopped. As a result, this Detachment was utilised to continue a &#x27;hearts-and-minds&#x27; campaign to gain support of local Punan tribes living near the border. On 12 August 1966 a formal peace treaty was signed by Indonesia and Malaysia and with the Confrontation finally at an end, 4 Detachment officially became non-operational on 9 September 1966. However the Detachment remained in Borneo until October 1966 before it returned to New Zealand.

=== Vietnam 1968–71 ===
On 16 November 1968, a Troop from 1 Ranger Squadron, NZSAS known as 4 Troop, New Zealand Special Air Service, was deployed to the Republic of South Vietnam. The Troop consisting of one officer and 25 other ranks was based in Nui Dat, South Vietnam and served in the 1st Australian Task Force, attached to the Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) which had arrived in 1966. Up until October 1968 the Australian SAS were performing a much wider and more aggressive range of actions, however, the new task force commander who took over reverted the SAS role to intelligence gathering and some ambush patrols. After a build-up period, the first New Zealand commanded patrol commenced on 7 January 1969. The SAS squadrons supported the Australian and New Zealand infantry forces in &quot;Operation Goodward&quot; during January. At the end of February a new rotation of Australian SAS arrived and joint-operations continued. 

The troopers were primarily employed on Long-Range Reconnaissance Patrols (LRRP) across Phuoc Tuy and into Bien Hoa province, mostly around the Mây Tào Mountains where the Communist headquarters were located. Patrols were to collect information for 1ATF and sometimes to conduct ambushes.

Each tour of duty in South Vietnam was for 12 months. At the end of each year, the Troop was replaced by another Troop from 1 Ranger Squadron, NZSAS. The first Troop was commanded by Captain Terry Culley; this Troop was replaced in full in late 1969 by a Troop commanded by Captain Graye Shattky. 

Members of this first replacement Troop took part in an operational Squadron parachute insertion on 15–16 December 1969 to provide further intelligence for &quot;Operation Marsden&quot; (29 November-28 December 1969) in which Australian and New Zealand forces launched attacks on the Communist stronghold in the Mây Tào Mountains which resulted in a major defeat for the Communists.

On 14 January 1970 Sergeant G.J. Campbell was killed in action, being the first and only fatal NZSAS casualty during the unit&#x27;s time in Vietnam. 

A new rotation of Australian SAS arrived on 18 February 1970. By this stage in the war, Vietcong activity in the province was decreasing due to the success of 1ATF operations. Consequently, SAS operations were limited to reconnaissance tasks around Nui Dat. At the same time, the task force commander temporarily repurposed 1ATF&#x27;s Defence and Employment (D&amp;E) Platoon to conduct LRRP intelligence-gathering patrols further afield. During March and April Australian and New Zealand SAS were sent out again to patrol the approaches to the Mây Tào Mountains and perform other Long-range reconnaissance patrols in Binh Tuy Province. 

By 1970 the Vietcong had become familiar with SAS insertion techniques and would lay in wait after hearing the approaching helicopter. To counter this, SAS operations began using &quot;cowboy insertions&quot; involving a second helicopter following the first. Two patrols would therefore be inserted and would travel together for five minutes. The second patrol would then stop and wait another five minutes, while the first patrol continued its mission. If there was no contact with the enemy the second patrol would then return to the landing zone where it would be extracted.

At the end of August and during September 1970 the Australian and New Zealand SAS participated in Operations Cung Chung II and III. 

The final rotation of New Zealand SAS occurred in late 1970, when the Troop was again replaced by a new body of men commanded by Second Lieutenant Jack Hayes. 

It was a NZ patrol that made the last contact with enemy forces in this rotation of Australian and New Zealand SAS, killing two Viet Cong soldiers north-west of Thua Tich on 4 February 1971. 4 Troop was withdrawn from South Vietnam on 20 February 1971, as a part of the New Zealand Government&#x27;s withdrawal policy. One more rotation of Australian SAS served in Vietnam before the complete withdrawal of Australian and New Zealand combat forces at the end of 1971.

The NZSAS did a total of 155 patrols in their 26 months of service in Vietnam with the loss of one KIA and four wounded.

=== Bougainville 1997–98 ===
From November 1997 to 15 February 1998, a 19-man troop sized detachment of NZSAS personnel were deployed as part of Operation BELISI, a peacekeeping operation in Bougainville. The troop was tasked with providing security, medium- to long-range communications and medical support. While the troopers were unarmed except for pepper spray, they were involved in a number of heated situations which required careful negotiation to defuse. The troopers also conducted &#x27;hearts-and-minds&#x27; patrols, staying in local villages and developing relationships with leaders.

In addition, the NZSAS were involved in providing security and close protection to the various groups involved in peace negotiations that were held in New Zealand during 1998, including escorting the delegates from their home locations in Papua New Guinea, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands to New Zealand.

=== Kuwait 1998 ===
Twenty-four NZSAS personnel were deployed to Kuwait in February 1998 on Operation GRIFFIN during a period of international tension with Iraq, tasked with rescuing downed airmen in hostile territory in the event of a US-led aerial campaign. A smaller force replaced them in May 1998 for a further two-month tour. There were no missions into Iraq undertaken during the deployment, though it was considered a useful opportunity to practice mobile desert warfare skills, and to have contact with US Forces which had been limited since the United States suspended its ANZUS relations with New Zealand in 1986.

Once the NZSAS contingent was withdrawn, a New Zealand Coalition force liaison officer was maintained, with the position being commonly held by an NZSAS officer. On 12 March 2001, NZSAS Officer, Acting Major John McNutt was fulfilling this role when he was accidentally killed during a bombing demonstration. The position was withdrawn after this incident.

=== East Timor 1999–2001 ===

In 1999 NZDF personnel were deployed to East Timor in response to a humanitarian and security crisis. The NZSAS deployed a Squadron sized contingent of 40 men under the command of (then) Major Peter Kelly, with two Troop Captains. On 9 September 1999, nine NZSAS personnel left New Zealand with an RNZAF C-130 aircraft, as the New Zealand Defence Force contribution to Operation DORIX, the evacuation of selected personnel from Dili, East Timor to Australia. Over 1500 personnel were evacuated during the operation under SASR and NZSAS protection.

On 20 September 1999 a &#x27;Response Force&#x27; consisting of 3 Squadron SASR, NZSAS troopers and elements of the United Kingdom Special Boat Service, departed Darwin by Royal Australian Air Force transport. They were tasked with securing the airport, a seaport and a heli-port to enable regular forces to land and deploy. This was achieved without any shots being fired. The NZSAS patrols were then utilised to perform to a variety of tasks including direction-action, special reconnaissance and close protection missions. The NZSAS element departed East Timor for New Zealand on 14 December 1999.

Following the deaths of two members of the New Zealand Battalion Group in late June and early August 2000, combat tracking support was requested from the NZSAS. In August 2000, a Troop of about 12 NZSAS combat trackers were deployed with the task of locating militia who were crossing the border into East Timor. The Troops&#x27; efforts led to the successful placing of a number of ambushes, resulting in the deaths of three militia. In addition to performing combat tracking, on 6 September 2000, this Troop was utilised to conduct a permissive cross-border helicopter extraction operation of United Nations staff based at Atambua, West Timor. The Troop departed East Timor for New Zealand in January 2001.

=== Afghanistan 2001–2012 ===
==== Afghanistan 2001–2005 ====
On 11 December 2001, as a part of New Zealand&#x27;s contribution to Operation Enduring Freedom, the NZSAS commenced Operation CONCORD. This deployment saw the NZSAS deploying a Squadron as a component of Task Force K-Bar to perform operations as part of the War on Terrorism in Afghanistan. The Squadron performed a variety of missions including special reconnaissance, direct action, close personal protection and sensitive site exploitation. Initially special reconnaissance patrols were performed on foot with insertion and extraction being conducted by helicopter in the high-altitude snow-covered areas of southern and central Afghanistan. Three NZSAS patrols were involved in this manner during Operation Anaconda in March 2002. In May 2002 the focus changed to mounted operations with patrols using modified American Humvees, supported by motorbikes to conduct &#x27;long-range extended-duration patrols&#x27;. These patrols would often last 20 to 30 days and cover between 1000 and 2000 kilometres. Three six-month &#x27;roulements&#x27; of between 40 and 65 soldiers from the NZSAS served in Afghanistan during this time, before the unit returned to New Zealand on 12 December 2002.

The NZSAS returned to Afghanistan in February 2004 on Operation in the lead up to the Afghanistan Presidential elections. Operations occurred in a number of provinces, utilising the same style of operations as the previous deployment. On 17 June 2004, two NZSAS soldiers were wounded in a pre-dawn gun-battle in central Afghanistan. In recognition of his actions during this engagement, SAS trooper Willie Apiata was awarded the Victoria Cross for New Zealand. The Squadron returned home in September 2004.

In 2005, with Afghan Parliamentary elections looming, Operation was conducted. The Squadron sized deployment was to utilise the NZSAS&#x27;s newly delivered purchase of thirteen Pinzgauer Special Operations Vehicles. The deployment was originally scheduled to commence in March 2005; however, due to problems with the new vehicles, this deployment date slipped to June 2005. Again, the squadron performed long-range patrols as well as direct-action operations, before being withdrawn in November 2005.

Over the three CONCORD deployments to Afghanistan there were &quot;casualties on both sides&quot; during gun battles, with injuries also sustained as a result of vehicle crashes and striking mines or other unexploded ordnance but no New Zealanders were killed.

==== Afghanistan 2009–2012 ====
82 NZSAS and NZDF support personnel deployed to Afghanistan in September 2009, under Operation WĀTEA to form Task Force 81. This deployment was different from the unit&#x27;s previous deployments to Afghanistan, as it was based in the capital city of Kabul, primarily to direct counter-insurgency operations in greater Kabul in cooperation with the Afghanistan Police&#x27;s Crisis Response Unit (Task Force 24), which was operating under NZSAS mentorship. 
Originally the location of the deployment was not revealed publicly, however, its location was inadvertently revealed in the Norwegian press. 
Three rotations of troops were conducted to sustain the initial deployment, which was initially due to end in March 2011. However the mission was extended for a further year, although personnel numbers were reduced to 45.

As part of the mentoring activities, NZSAS personnel were among the forces which responded to the January 2010 attack in central Kabul. Two personnel, one of them Corporal &quot;Steve&quot; David Steven Askin, were injured during the terrorist attack against the Inter-Continental hotel in Kabul on 29 June 2011, where members of the NZSAS also provided &#x27;helo sniping&#x27; support. Askin and one other serviceman involved at the Inter-Continental, Commander Jamie Pennell, were awarded the New Zealand Gallantry Star, the second-highest award after the Victoria Cross. 

Two members of the unit were killed during the deployment while mentoring operations. On 19 August 2011, Corporal Douglas Grant was killed when responding to an attack on the British Council building in the centre of Kabul, where the NZSAS was required to utilise specialist entry capabilities and Lance Corporal Leon Smith was killed on 28 September 2011 during an operation in Wardak Province.

In January 2011, General David Petraeus announced that, since 2009, the NZSAS had made 60 &quot;high-risk&quot; arrests of suspected militants or Taliban leaders, seized 20 weapons caches, and foiled four attacks. He added that the unit had successfully executed more than 90% of its operations and raids without firing a shot. The unit was withdrawn from Afghanistan on 31 March 2012.

===== Operation Burnham war crimes allegations =====
On 21–22 August 2010, the NZSAS and members of the Afghan Crisis Response Unit participated in a military operation in Afghanistan&#x27;s Tirgiran Valley known as Operation Burnham as part of the International Security Assistance Force. In March 2017, investigative journalists Nicky Hager and Jon Stephenson published a book on Operation Burnham &quot;Hit &amp; Run: The New Zealand SAS in Afghanistan and the meaning of honour&quot; which alleged that NZSAS personnel had committed war crimes. The authors alleged that NZSAS personnel had attacked the Afghan villages of Naik and Khak Khuday Dad after Lieutenant Tim O&#x27;Donnell, 2/1 RNZIR part of the NZPRT, was killed by a roadside bomb.

The allegations of war crimes in &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; generated considerable public and media interest in New Zealand, which generated calls for an independent inquiry. Despite initial denying that the raids had occurred in the two villages, the NZDF subsequently acknowledged that NZSAS forces had been present in one of those villages but asserted that claims of civilian casualties were &quot;unfounded.&quot; On 11 April 2018, the Labour-led coalition government announced that the Government would be holding an inquiry into Operation Burnham and the allegations in &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot;.

====2021 Afghanistan evacuation====
On 19 August 2021, the NZDF deployed a RNZAF C-130 aircraft to evacuate New Zealanders and other foreign nationals from Afghanistan under Operation Kõkako which involved approximately 80 NZDF personnel. NZSAS personnel, including the Female Engagement Team, guided evacuees safely through crowds outside the perimeter of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul to perimeter entry points.

=== Other deployments and activities ===
Regular exchanges of personnel with foreign special forces units are conducted in order to build and maintain skills. This primarily occurs with the British Special Air Service and Special Boat Service the Australian Special Air Service and the 2nd Commando Regiment but has also included units from Canada, Thailand and Malaysia with NZSAS personnel often providing combat tracking training in return. In addition &quot;a number&quot; of individual NZSAS personnel have successfully served alongside other New Zealand soldiers on peacekeeping operations and in peace-monitoring roles, including the New Zealand Contingent attached to the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai.

==== Training Malaysian Police Field Force personnel 1977–1980 ====

The New Zealand Military Attaché in Kuala Lumpur was alerted to the Malaysian Police Field Force&#x27;s intention to raise a special forces unit. The NZSAS deployed a small training team, who were based at Ipoh and Sungai Pateni to assist with training the new unit. By rotating officers and non-commissioned officers, the NZSAS were able to sustain Operation RETURN ANGEL, for some two years until it reached a successful conclusion and the units were operational.

==== Rhodesia 1979–1980 ====

Seven individual NZSAS personnel deployed to Southern Rhodesia as part of the &quot;New Zealand Army Truce Monitoring Contingent Rhodesia 1979–80&quot; on Operation MIDFORD. The contingent also included a number of ex-NZSAS personnel and served in Rhodesia from 7 December 1979 to 10 March 1980.

==== Bosnia 1995–1996 ====

Initially a number of individual NZSAS personnel deployed as part of the infantry company that New Zealand contributed to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Bosnia during the break-up of Yugoslavia. From the third rotation of this infantry company, a group of four NZSAS personnel deployed in a Close Personal Protection capacity, with three rotations occurring over approximately eighteen months.

==== Papua New Guinea tsunami 1998 ====

On 17 July an earthquake occurred off the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. The shock occurred on a reverse fault and led to a tsunami that caused significant destruction and a high number of deaths. In response to an international request for assistance, New Zealand dispatched a Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 aircraft loaded with relief supplies and six NZSAS advanced medics. The short notice deployment of the medics helped preserve lives that otherwise might have been lost.

==== Solomon Islands 2000 ====

By June 2000, after several years of tension, the situation in the Solomon Islands had become unstable, resulting in the NZSAS being tasked with developing an evacuation plan for the New Zealand High Commission and its staff, as well as other New Zealanders in the Solomon Islands. A small NZSAS Troop was deployed on , one of two Royal New Zealand Navy vessels that were stationed off the island. The Troop performed reconnaissance activities, however the situation calmed and the Troop was returned to New Zealand in July 2000.

==== Support to New Zealand Police ====
In 1964, NZSAS troopers were utilised to instruct early New Zealand Police Armed Offenders Squad members in field craft and weapon handling. This training relationship continued with the establishment of the Police Anti-Terrorist Squad (now known as the Special Tactics Group) and also included joint exercises. On 25 January 1968, David Maxwell Heron entered a farm house, murdered his brother-in-law and assaulted his brother-in-law&#x27;s wife with a heavy object, before tying her up and fleeing. Five days after the incident armed NZSAS troopers joined the search for the suspect in a large area of swamp near Meremere, however Heron surrendered without incident the next day. During the Mount Eden Prison riots which occurred on 20–21 July 1965, the &quot;battle trained&quot; NZSAS troopers armed with automatic rifles with fixed bayonets, who &quot;were prepared to shoot if necessary&quot;, were called to support police on the prison perimeter. The rioting prisoners eventually surrendered. Following the arrest of two of the French agents involved in the sinking of the ship &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; on 10 July 1985, the NZSAS were requested to support the New Zealand Police at an emergency holding prison established in Ardmore. The prison was used to hold Dominique Prieur, one of the arrested agents, due to concerns that French authorities might launch a rescue operation.

== Organisation ==
As at February 2013, the main elements of the 1st New Zealand Special Air Service Regiment were:
* Headquarters
* A Squadron – Special Air Service 
* B Squadron – Special Air Service 
* D Squadron – Commando 
* E Squadron – Explosive Ordnance Disposal 
* Support Squadron

=== A and B Squadrons – Special Air Service ===
The two NZSAS Sabre Squadrons are combat units capable of conducting a wide range of Special Operations tasks. Each squadron is divided into four troops. The four troops specialise in four different areas: Amphibious, Air, Mobility and Mountain operations.

After completing the full NZSAS Regiment selection course, NZSAS candidates go on to undertake an intensive training cycle to build core skills. Those who complete the training cycle are accepted into the NZSAS and wear the sand beret with NZSAS badge and blue NZSAS stable belt. NZSAS operators then conduct further training to learn advanced special operations skills.

====Female Engagement Team====
In 2017, the NZSAS established a six woman Female Engagement Team (FET) to provide support on operations with FET members able to engage with local women and adolescents in situations in which engagement with NZSAS male soldiers would be culturally unacceptable. The first FET selection course was held in November 2017 over three days with physical and mental assessments, and in January 2018, five successful candidates commenced a four month training course including gender issues, cultural knowledge and how to &quot;move, shoot, communicate and medicate&quot; to be able to work alongside Sabre Squadron soldiers.

=== D Squadron – Commando ===
The Commando Squadron (formerly Counter Terrorist Tactical Assault Group until 5 December 2009) was formed in 2005 in a bid to provide a dedicated counter terrorist capability within 1 NZSAS and the New Zealand Defence Force. The squadron consists of an undisclosed number of Counter Terrorist operators. Members of the Commando Squadron wear the sand beret with the Commando badge and stable belt. The Commando Squadron has the role of responding to domestic terrorist and special recovery incidents in New Zealand. The Commando Squadron is based full-time alongside the badged squadrons at the Papakura Military Camp in Auckland and are under the command of the Commanding Officer, 1 NZSAS. The Commando Squadron uses the Battle Training Facility at the Ardmore Military Camp to conduct their Close Quarter Battle urban, dynamic entry and room clearing drills as well as their marksman skills.

=== E Squadron – Explosive Ordnance Disposal ===
The 1st New Zealand Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Squadron is a specialist task unit within the NZSAS Regiment. It was established in August 2005 as an independent Force Troops Squadron, before coming under Operational Command of 1 NZSAS Regiment in July 2009. It provides support to the New Zealand police to &quot;render safe&quot; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and improvised explosive devices, commercial explosives and military munitions, domestically as well as overseas where New Zealand troops are operating. Personnel who serve in the squadron wear the sand beret with the EOD Squadron badge and stable belt. The Squadron badge includes the motto &quot;Into Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;. The Squadron is based at Trentham Military Camp, with Troops located in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

=== Support Squadron ===
The Support Squadron is responsible for meeting the support needs of the NZSAS Regiment and includes logistics, intelligence, medical, administration and communications personnel. Personnel are given specific trade training upon joining the Regiment as well as having the opportunity to complete other specialist courses such as parachuting. Qualified Support Squadron personnel wear the sand beret with their corps badge.

== Selection ==
To join the NZSAS Regiment, New Zealand Army, Navy, or Air Force personnel must pass a selection course, with the course varying depending on the role they seek within the Regiment. In 2011 the selection course was also opened to civilians; they spend two days preparing for the selection course learning military skills considered necessary to compete safely against military applicants. In 2007, a four part documentary &quot;NZSAS: First Among Equals&quot; was produced on the selection course and training.

=== Special Air Service / Commando ===
The SAS selection standard remains the same, with the full course aiming to identify &quot;self-disciplined individuals who are capable of working effectively as part of a small group under stressful conditions for long periods of time&quot;. However, the earlier phases of the selection course have been opened up to candidates who wish to join the Regiment as a Commando. This is described as advancing through a series of &#x27;gates&#x27;.

*Gate 1: After four days the first gate is reached which allows a candidate to be considered for a role as a Commando. This phase involves completing &quot;1 NZSAS Regt fitness testing and mixed terrain navigation&quot;.
*Gate 2: Gate 2 is reached after nine days and is the conclusion of the selection course. This phase involves completing &quot;close country navigation and other activities&quot; and those who get to this point are considered for SAS training. Those who are selected go on to complete an intensive period of training to build core special forces skills. On average 10–15% of candidates pass both selection and cycle training.
*Commando and SAS commissioned Officer candidates also undergo an additional two days of selection to test their suitability to solve problems when tired and under pressure.

=== Support / Explosive Ordnance Disposal ===
All support and EOD personnel who wish to join the NZSAS Regiment must complete a ten-day &#x27;Special Operations Forces Induction Course&#x27;. This involves completing a revised version of the first two days of NZSAS Selection. Given the nature of their roles, support and EOD candidates are given more time to complete the activities than NZSAS and Commando candidates and are provided with normal sleep and food intake. The course also &quot;provides familiarisation with specialist weapons and equipment, and educates personnel on the ethos and values of the Unit&quot;.

==Equipment==
Soldiers are armed with a variety of weapons systems including the Barrett MRAD sniper rifle and the Barrett M107A1 anti-materiel rifle.

In 2017, the Thales Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle entered service with five surplus Bushmasters purchased from the Australian Defence Force for direct action designated Protected Heavy. In 2018, an undisclosed number of Supacat HMT Extenda vehicles entered service replacing the Pinzgauer for special reconnaissance designated Mobility Heavy. An undisclosed number of two modified civilian vehicle types also entered service in 2018. The vehicles for terrorism and support and influence are designated Low Profile Utility and Low Profile Protected and were supplied by Jankel Armouring.

<doc id="680458" wikidata="Q210048" url="?curid=680458" title="Innuendo (album)">
<text>Innuendo is the fourteenth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 4 February 1991 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom and was the band&#x27;s first studio album to be released by Hollywood Records in the United States. Produced by David Richards and the band, it was the band&#x27;s last album to be released in lead singer Freddie Mercury&#x27;s lifetime. The album reached the No. 1 spot on the UK album charts for two weeks, and also peaked at No. 1 in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, staying at No. 1 for three weeks, four weeks, six weeks, and eight weeks, respectively. It was the first Queen album to go Gold in the US upon its release since &quot;The Works&quot; in 1984.

The album was recorded between March 1989 and November 1990. In the spring of 1987, Mercury had been diagnosed with AIDS, although he kept his illness a secret from the public and denied numerous media reports that he was seriously ill. The band and producers were aiming for a November or December release date in order to catch the crucial Christmas market, but Mercury&#x27;s declining health meant that the release of the album did not take place until February 1991. Stylistically, &quot;Innuendo&quot; has been regarded as a return to Queen&#x27;s mid-1970s bombastic period of exaggerated music and lavish production. Nine months after the album was released, on 24 November, Mercury died of AIDS-derived bronchopneumonia.

The album cover was designed by Queen and Richard Gray. The booklets and single covers from the album are inspired by illustrations by 19th century French artist Jean-Jacques Grandville. &quot;Innuendo&quot; was voted the 94th greatest album of all time in a national 2006 BBC poll.

==Background and recording==

Queen released their thirteenth album, &quot;The Miracle&quot;, in May 1989, but unlike their previous albums, they did not conduct a live tour. In an interview Freddie Mercury conducted with BBC Radio 1, he said that he wanted to break from the &quot;album – tour – album – tour&quot; routine. He had privately been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1987, and at the time of the interview had been diagnosed with AIDS, which was not yet publicised; however, rumours had been spreading since 1988 about his health and of the possibility that he had the disease, with speculation fuelled by a clear physical decline in his appearance, particularly weight loss. While he kept quiet due to his preference to not to talk to the media, the other band members denied the rumours; at one point, band member Roger Taylor told reporters that &quot;he is healthy and working&quot;. In February 1990, Queen won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. While Mercury accepted the award for the band at the Dominion Theatre, Brian May spoke for the band. Mercury&#x27;s increasingly gaunt appearance at the ceremony sparked further speculation from the public about his health, which persisted throughout 1990. The 1990 BRIT Awards would be Mercury&#x27;s final public appearance.

Mercury did not speak publicly about his health, saying that he did not want to sell his music out of people&#x27;s sympathy for him. He was determined to continue working on music with Queen for as long as he could, saying that he would &quot;keep working until I fucking drop&quot;. Mercury was persistently bothered by reporters at his London home, making it difficult for the band to record. As a result, the band relocated to Mountain Studios in Montreux, where the safer and more peaceful atmosphere allowed the band to concentrate. Early in &quot;Innuendo&quot;″s recording, the band decided that all work would be again credited to Queen as a whole instead of to individual contributing members; May said that the decision made a significant impact in the recording process, while Taylor said that it helped eliminate much of the egotistical struggles that would normally cause bands to break up.

The album was released in the US under a new label, the Disney-owned Hollywood Records, in an effort to garner greater exposure there. Hollywood had also secured the rights to Queen&#x27;s Elektra and Capitol back catalogs, and began reissuing albums early in 1991, marking Queen&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

==Songs==
===&quot;Innuendo&quot;===
&quot;Innuendo&quot; began as a jam session in Switzerland amongst Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon in spring 1989. Freddie Mercury was upstairs and heard them playing the beat, and turned it into a song, creating the melody and starting off the lyrics. From then on all four worked on polishing the track and Taylor took over the lyrics (which were written as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and their song &quot;Kashmir&quot;). The middle section, written by Mercury, was included later and it featured a synth-orchestra programmed by producer David Richards and a flamenco interlude played by Yes guitarist Steve Howe, who had come to visit them and was asked to play. &quot;Innuendo&quot; was released as a single in January 1991, debuting at No. 1 in the UK.

===&quot;I&#x27;m Going Slightly Mad&quot;===

&quot;I&#x27;m Going Slightly Mad&quot; was begun in Mercury&#x27;s London house, after he had the idea of writing a song about madness, inspired by Noël Coward&#x27;s camp one-liners. Most of the lyrics like &quot;banana tree&quot; or &quot;one needle&quot;, came from both him and his friend Peter Straker, who stayed up all night in Mercury&#x27;s kitchen, devising ever more outlandish lines. The music is Mercury&#x27;s and is one of the earliest songs the band were working on in Montreux when Steve Howe came in.
The video that accompanied the song saw Mercury dressed in a costume suit with wild hair, white gloves, long pointing shoes and extremely heavy make up, filmed in black and white. Whilst Queen fans were thoroughly amused by the band in the video, in the documentary, &quot;Champions of the World&quot;, Taylor confessed, from the band&#x27;s perspective, the video was marred by Mercury&#x27;s appearance having to be camouflaged by costume and make-up, as Taylor admitted Mercury looked &quot;pretty ill, at that point.&quot;

===&quot;Headlong&quot;===

&quot;Headlong&quot; was written by May at the studio they had in Switzerland. He recorded it for his debut solo album, &quot;Back to the Light&quot;, which he was making at the same time, but after hearing Mercury sing it, decided it worked better as a Queen song.

===&quot;I Can&#x27;t Live with You&quot;===

&quot;I Can&#x27;t Live with You&quot; was also written for May&#x27;s solo album. He gave it to the band as well since Taylor, Deacon and Mercury were fond of the track. Drums were programmed on synth by May, and the keyboard-pads were added by the producer.
An alternative version of this song appeared on the 1997 compilation album &quot;Queen Rocks&quot;, billed as the &quot;&#x27;97 Rocks Retake&quot;. It was said to be more along the lines of how May and Taylor originally wanted the track to sound, with a harder, guitar-driven rock edge. May has stated in an interview that most of the original demo is in the recording, making the song &quot;impossible&quot; to mix.

===&quot;Don&#x27;t Try So Hard&quot;===
&quot;Don&#x27;t Try So Hard&quot; came from Mercury. The intro &quot;rain&quot; is actually the pre-set sound of the Korg M1, which appears when it is switched on (&quot;00: Universe&quot;).

===&quot;Ride the Wild Wind&quot;===

&quot;Ride the Wild Wind&quot; was composed by Taylor, who recorded a demo with his own vocals. The album version is sung by Mercury with Taylor on backing vocals. The song is a sort of sequel of Taylor&#x27;s &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; composition, &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with My Car&quot;, which focused on Taylor&#x27;s passion for cars and racing. This time, the song involved all of the other members, that gave life to a fast song with beating drums and rhythmic bass line, which create the sensation of speed and engine&#x27;s roar. In the mid-part, a May solo, which accentuates the sense of high velocity, and also gives the song a heavier sound. In some parts, a racing car can be heard.

===&quot;All God&#x27;s People&quot;===
&quot;All God&#x27;s People&quot; was co-written by Mercury and Mike Moran, initially as part of Mercury&#x27;s &quot;Barcelona&quot; project under the title &quot;Africa by Night&quot;. He had asked May to play guitar, then one thing led to another and the entire band played. The keyboard parts were played by Moran. Similar to &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; from &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, &quot;All God&#x27;s People&quot; has a strong gospel influence.

===&quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot;===

&quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; was written by Taylor. Keyboards were programmed by all band members in the studio, and conga percussion was recorded by David Richards. The music video for this song was Mercury&#x27;s last appearance in a video medium, and with his knowing farewell look straight at the camera, Mercury whispers &quot;I still love you&quot; at the end of the song. By the time the video was made, it had become impossible to disguise that Mercury was seriously ill. The video was filmed in colour, but converted to black and white to minimise Mercury&#x27;s frail appearance. At a later date, colour footage of the band making the video was released, revealing just how ill Mercury was at the time.

===&quot;Delilah&quot;===
&quot;Delilah&quot; is a song Mercury penned for his favourite female calico cat named Delilah. Although Mercury had about 11 cats, Delilah was special. May recorded his solo using a talk box. Taylor later admitted he is not fond of the song, stating &quot;I hate &#x27;Delilah&#x27;. That&#x27;s just not me.&quot;

===&quot;The Hitman&quot;===
The fly-away rocker &quot;The Hitman&quot; was started by Mercury. The original version was apparently on keyboards and in a different key. May took Mercury&#x27;s riff (not uncommon), changed the key and recorded a demo of the heavy version. Deacon then re-arranged the structure and they all filled the gaps in lyrics and recorded it. All of the backing vocals were done by May. The demo version is sung by May, with Mercury making spoken comments (like &quot;Bite the bullet baby!&quot;).

===&quot;Bijou&quot;===

&quot;Bijou&quot; was an idea Mercury and May had of making a song &quot;inside-out&quot;, having guitar doing the verses and the vocal doing the break. Mercury put the chords, title and lyrics, and the two of them worked on the guitar parts. Mercury sang the first line and then May transferred the melody to his Red Special. The song was finished without any input from Taylor or Deacon. The inspiration for the song itself is twofold, Brian May; “The vocal is a succinct and very precise little verse, a little gem, a &quot;Bijou&quot; - a jewel buried at the heart of the piece: hence the name of the song.” “My Mum was given a budgie by a friend - it became a great companion for her after she lost my Dad. She called it &quot;Bijou&quot; and she would spend hours talking to it! ..It was her little Bijou.” In 2008, Queen + Paul Rodgers performed this song in their shows of the Rock the Cosmos Tour by May playing the verse live and then having Mercury&#x27;s studio vocals play while a screen showed footage from the band&#x27;s Wembley concert in 1986, with the visuals put in sync with the tape.

===&quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;===

&quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; was written by May, based on a chord sequence he had been working on. May decided to use the sequence, and both he and Mercury decided the theme of the lyrics and wrote the first verse together. From then on May finished the lyrics, completed the vocal melody and wrote the bridge, inspired by &quot;Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon&quot;. Some keys and ideas were also suggested by the producer. The song chronicles the effort of Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life. The song was initially not released as a single as part of promotion for the &quot;Innuendo&quot; album, but was released in October 1991 as the band launched their &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; album. The video for the song featured a compilation of clips from all their videos since 1982, in support of the &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; album. Due to Mercury&#x27;s critical health at the time of its production, a fresh appearance by the band in a video was not possible. The track is a personal favourite of fellow British artist Elton John, who performed the song at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert with the remaining members of Queen, and Tony Iommi playing rhythm guitar. A different live version featuring Elton John on vocals later appeared on Queen&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits III&quot; album.

==Singles==
&quot;Innuendo&quot; was the lead single from the album in most countries, except for the US where &quot;Headlong&quot; was released to radio as a promo prior to the album&#x27;s release. The single was released on 14 January 1991 in Europe and in March 1991 in the US as a promo single, becoming Queen&#x27;s third UK No. 1 single. The song also achieved modest success in the US, charting at No. 17 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Still, the length and style of the track limited its appeal, and it only spent one week at No. 1 in the UK and quickly slid down the chart, spending only six weeks in the top 75. (B-side on 7 inch release: &quot;Bijou&quot;).

&quot;I&#x27;m Going Slightly Mad&quot; was released on 4 March 1991. The song reached No. 1 in Hong Kong and reached No. 22 on the UK charts. (B-side on 7 inch release: &quot;The Hitman&quot; in some countries, in others it was &quot;Lost Opportunity&quot;, which was a non-album cut).

&quot;Headlong&quot; was released as a promotional single in January 1991 in the US and as a single on 13 May 1991 in the UK. It entered the UK charts at No. 14, and reached No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. (B-side on 12 inch release: &quot;All God&#x27;s People&quot; in some countries, in others, &quot;Lost Opportunity&quot; and in a few, &quot;The Hitman&quot;. The 12&quot; and CD also feature &quot;Mad the Swine&quot;).

&quot;I Can&#x27;t Live with You&quot; was released as a promo single to radio stations in the US. This two-track promo single, completely remixed by Brian Malouf, uses slightly different lead vocal tracks by Mercury, louder and tighter harmony tracks, and reprogrammed synth drums, resulting in a much more punchy and &quot;over the top&quot; poppy version than included on the album. It reached No. 28 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

&quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; was first released in the US on Mercury&#x27;s birthday, 5 September 1991 on cassette and to radio. In the UK it was released in December 1991 following Mercury&#x27;s death, as a double A-side with &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. The single was the UK&#x27;s Christmas No. 1 of 1991.

&quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; was released on 14 October 1991 in the UK. The single was taken from the album but was released as promotion for the &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; album (&quot;Classic Queen&quot; in the US/Canada), and peaked at No. 16 on the UK charts. After Mercury&#x27;s death in November, the song re-entered the British charts and spent as many weeks in the top 75 as it had upon its original release. This single was released just six weeks before Mercury died. In 1992, the song was released as a double A-side with &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in the US and reached No. 2 in the US. (The original B-side in October 1991 was &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;).

==Critical reception==
In 1991, Chuck Eddy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Innuendo&quot; was &quot;the group&#x27;s most playful top-to-bottom pile since &quot;The Game&quot;&quot; and &quot;there&#x27;s no getting around the new album&#x27;s craft&quot;, which he suggested meant the band were &quot;finally satisfied with their lot in life&quot;, but he added that &quot;&quot;Innuendo&quot; is so lightweight you&#x27;ll forget it as soon as it&#x27;s over — which, with this band, should go without saying anyway&quot;. In 2016, for the same publication, Ron Hart described it as &quot;Queen&#x27;s last masterpiece&quot; and an album which &quot;boldly confronted mortality,&quot; likening it to David Bowie&#x27;s final album &quot;Blackstar&quot;.

&quot;People&quot; wrote, &quot;If this is cartoon rock and roll, at least it&#x27;s good and brazenly cartoonish.&quot; The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; wrote, &quot;Queen dispenses with any stylistic variations or flirtations with dance music and offers its basic sound: lots of Mercury vocal leaps, fuzzed-out May guitar, choral overdubs and a sense of orchestral importance mixed with straightforward hard rock&quot;, concluding that it was a &quot;mixed bag&quot;. The &quot;LA Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Given the bombast and harsh assault of Queen&#x27;s biggest hits, it&#x27;s a shock to find that the heart of... &quot;Innuendo&quot;, is made of soft, sweet, sticky, sentimental goo&quot;, but added &quot;the goo actually goes down well&quot; and &quot;Queen hasn&#x27;t forgotten how to rock.&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMusic wrote, &quot;&quot;Innuendo&quot; was a fitting way to end one of rock&#x27;s most successful careers&quot;. For &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked it as Queen&#x27;s ninth greatest album, writing that &quot;&quot;Innuendo&quot; had a lot of intelligent humour and pathos about it.&quot; He praised the title track&#x27;s &quot;brilliantly synthesised orchestrations&quot; and added &quot;perhaps most poignant of all is the low key yet mesmerising &#x27;These Are The Days Of Our Lives&#x27;, which ended with Mercury’s whispered paean &#x27;I still love you&#x27;, which was moving in its simplicity.&quot; Dome concluded, &quot;The album summed up how Queen could draw people close, yet still keep them at a convenient distance.&quot;

==Track listing==
All tracks credited to Queen, except &quot;All God&#x27;s People&quot; credited to Queen and Mike Moran. All lead vocals by Freddie Mercury, except &quot;Ride the Wild Wind&quot;, sung by Mercury with Roger Taylor.

===Original release===
* Due to the total length of the album, five tracks had to be shortened in order to fit on the LP release. These tracks were &quot;I&#x27;m Going Slightly Mad&quot; (4:06), &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; (3:55), &quot;Don&#x27;t Try So Hard&quot; (3:33), &quot;The Hitman&quot; (3:43), and &quot;Bijou&quot; (1:19). The track listing for the LP release is also slightly different from the one for the CD release, with &quot;Don&#x27;t Try So Hard&quot; moved to side 2, between &quot;Delilah&quot; and &quot;The Hitman&quot;. Some of the shortened tracks can be found on the B-sides of concurrent 12&quot; singles.

===2015 LP===
&quot;Innuendo&quot; was re-released on vinyl on 25 September 2015 by Virgin EMI Records and Hollywood Records, alongside all of Queen&#x27;s other studio albums. This was the first time the album had been presented on vinyl in full, spread across 2 LPs. Just as the original LP had an altered track listing, the 2 LP version swapped the placement of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live With You&quot; and &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; to have a similar amount of playing time on each side of vinyl.

<doc id="680466" wikidata="Q5936320" url="?curid=680466" title="Wawa (company)">
<text>Wawa, Inc. ( ) is an American chain of convenience stores and gas stations originating in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and located along the East Coast of the United States, operating in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, West Virginia and Georgia. Wawa is based in, primarily associated with, and mainly concentrated in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, though it gradually expanded its store locations, over many decades, far beyond the Philadelphia area. The company&#x27;s corporate headquarters is located in the Wawa area of Chester Heights, Pennsylvania in Greater Philadelphia.

, Wawa was the largest convenience store chain in the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area and the third-largest food retailer in greater Philadelphia after Acme Markets and ShopRite.

==History==
The Wawa business began in 1803 as an iron foundry. In 1890, George Wood, an entrepreneur from New Jersey, moved to Delaware County, Pennsylvania; it was here that he began the Wawa Dairy Farm. Wood imported cows from the British Crown dependency island of Guernsey, and bought of land in the Chester Heights area; the corporate headquarters would later be renamed Wawa. Since pasteurization was not yet available, many children faced sickness from consuming raw milk. Wood arranged for doctors to certify his milk was sanitary and safe for consumption, which convinced many consumers to buy the product. The strategy worked, and allowed the Wawa dairy to grow. Demand for dairy products grew rapidly during the 1920s, and so did the company. Wawa began using the slogan &quot;Buy Health by the Bottle&quot;; they served customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, delivering milk to customers&#x27; homes.

In the 1960s, however, many consumers began buying milk in stores instead of using home delivery. Wawa started to open its own stores to adjust to these market changes. On April 16, 1964, Grahame Wood, George Wood&#x27;s grandson, opened the first Wawa Food Market at 1212 MacDade Boulevard in Folsom, Pennsylvania, which remained in operation until June 17, 2016, when it closed in favor of a new &quot;Super Wawa&quot; down the street. A parade was held from the original location to the new store on opening day.

The Wawa Food Market stores were also part of a then-new trend in retailing, the convenience store. Open both earlier and later than traditional supermarkets, they carried other foods and beverages besides milk, as well as other items from the Wawa dairy.

In 1977, Wawa began sharing ownership of the company with its associates through profit-sharing plans. In 1992, Wawa formalized its associate ownership with its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), with stock being awarded to associates annually based on the prior year&#x27;s service. Because the company is privately held, Wawa secures an independent assessment of its stock value at regular intervals to ensure that the ESOP is fairly maintained. Today, the ESOP accounts for more than 40% of Wawa stock.

==Company==
===Name and logo===

The chain&#x27;s name comes from the site of the company&#x27;s first milk plant and corporate headquarters in the Wawa, Pennsylvania area. The name of the town &quot;Wawa&quot; is in turn derived from the Ojibwe word &quot;we&#x27;we&quot; (pronounced &quot;way-way&quot;) meaning snow goose, despite the company&#x27;s image of a Canada goose.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow uses the word &quot;Wawa&quot; in Book II of his 1855 poem &quot;The Four Winds&quot; in &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, in which he writes, &quot;He it was who ... sent the wild-goose, Wawa, northward.&quot; Although the poem does not identify the species, an image of a Canada goose in flight appears in Wawa&#x27;s corporate logo.

Wally Goose, an anthropomorphic Canada goose wearing a Wawa shirt, is the mascot for the company, and is used in store openings and marketing material.

===Leadership===
The current CEO of Wawa is Chris Gheysens, who succeeded Howard Stoeckel in January 2013. Eleuthère (Thère) du Pont has served as both the CFO and president, but is no longer associated with the company. Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Wood Jr. is chairman of the board of directors. Many Wood family members are active in the company. Although Wawa is a family-run business, Wawa associates own roughly 50% of the company, more than 40% of which is owned through the company&#x27;s employee stock-ownership program.

===Holdings and locations===

In 2015, Wawa ranked 34th on the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine list of the largest private companies, with total revenues of $9.68 billion. , Wawa employs over 22,000 people in 720+ stores (450+ offering gasoline). , Wawa&#x27;s New Jersey stores were concentrated mostly in South Jersey.

 Wawa Inc. and the Wood family together control about of land, containing the corporate headquarters, the Wawa dairy farm, and J.T. Farms, within two municipalities in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. The properties are located in Chester Heights and Middletown Township. Wawa Inc. owns of land around &quot;Red Roof,&quot; the corporate headquarters, of land around the Wawa dairy, and the J.T. Farms. The Wood family owns of estate property. Cynthia Mayer of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said that, as a result of the land holdings, the Wood family was &quot;the closest thing to a feudal barony this side of du Pont.&quot;

Beginning in the 1940s, the dairy facility began selling excess parcels of land. In 1964, it sold about 40 acres to the Franklin Mint. Several years prior to 1989, the dairy sold 25 acres of land to a retirement complex, Granite Farms Estates. The process of selling excess land continued sporadically.

Wawa Inc. owns the 225-acre J.T. Farms, a separate farm property. Wawa Inc. leases it to Bill Faul, who maintained a herd of 100 Holstein cattle and paid $1,500 (currently $2778.12) per month. Wawa continued to own the farm due to symbolic reasons. It also kept heifers along Route 1 in a strip of land adjacent to the plant which did not produce milk; Fritz Schroeder, then-vice president of Wawa Inc., said in 1989, &quot;[w]e like them for the ambiance.&quot;

====Corporate headquarters====

The company&#x27;s corporate headquarters is located in the Wawa area, along Baltimore Pike in Chester Heights. The headquarters is in proximity to Middletown Township. about 300 employees work in the headquarters. The Borough of Chester Heights receives a majority of its local services tax from employees of Wawa.

==Programs and promotions==

Wawa provides surcharge-free ATMs, the result of a partnership with PNC Bank that began in 1985. Wawa implemented the program in stores in 1996. In 2010, Wawa surpassed 1 billion transactions under the PNC brand.

In the late 1980s and through the 1990s, Wawa engaged in a scholarship sponsorship program that involved Irish students (mainly from UCC in Cork, Ireland) running some stores on the Pennsylvania Main Line, allowing the students to study for their MBAs from Saint Joseph&#x27;s University in Philadelphia.

In 1994, Wawa opened a store in Center City, Philadelphia, which sold food only.

In 1994, Wawa debuted the &quot;Super Wawa&quot;, larger stores with public restrooms and more parking. Gasoline pumps were added in 1996. On October 21, 2010, Wawa began testing the sale of diesel fuel at 12 of its New Jersey locations due to an increasing number of cars using this fuel.

In the 2000s, Wawa was among the first stores to implement self-serve computer touch-screen menus for food orders, in an attempt to improve order accuracy, speed and for upselling.

In 2003, Wawa and McLane Co. reached a 30-year agreement to construct a distribution center in Carney&#x27;s Point, New Jersey, to handle the majority of Wawa&#x27;s distribution. The center began operation in May 2004.

In 2005, Wawa partnered with JPMorgan Chase to offer a Visa credit card branded with the Wawa name. It ceased issuing new cards in December 2007 and the program was canceled in November 2010. Wawa would later partner with Citi to restart the Wawa credit card program.

Wawa moved into social media to connect with its customers, and in 2006, its &quot;I Love Wawa&quot; MySpace page had over 5,000 members. By the middle of 2013, its Facebook page had reached nearly 1.1 million likes.

On June 30, 2010, 20 Wawa locations in Pennsylvania started a trial of selling Pennsylvania Lottery tickets from automated kiosks. On December 6, 2010, it announced that all 210 Pennsylvania Wawa locations would sell lottery tickets from kiosks by spring 2011.

On April 16, 2014, to celebrate its 50th anniversary, Wawa gave away free coffee and launched a nonprofit foundation to donate $50 million to health and hunger initiatives.

==Products==

Wawa offers products found at most convenience chain marts such as chips, drinks, and soda. Wawa also sells its own branded iced tea, orange juice, and milk. Wawa used to sell its own branded soda but it has been discontinued. Wawa has Coca-Cola Freestyle soda fountains.

Key products include its variety of coffee, latte, and cappuccino flavors and sizes, and made-to-order hoagies. Wawa also offers a brand of hot breakfast products, most famous of which is the &quot;Sizzli&quot;, and also a full deli with touch-screen ordering of sandwiches, hot sides, drinks, and deli meats. Wawa sells alcohol in Florida, Virginia, and at select locations in Pennsylvania.

For a short time between 1994 and 1996, Wawa sold Pizza Hut personal pan pizzas and Taco Bell burritos. In 2014, Wawa began selling a 7.5-inch deep-dish pizza on focaccia bread available in five varieties; this was later discontinued.

In 2020, Wawa tested burgers, waffle fries, and chicken sandwiches at six locations. Later in the same year, Wawa begin testing a dinner menu at select locations. The dinner menu includes items such as burgers, fries, pasta, and rotisserie chicken.

In 2022, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine ranked the Gobbler, Wawa&#x27;s seasonal Thanksgiving-themed hoagie, as the chain&#x27;s best sandwich among 15 taste-tested.

In 2023, Wawa began selling pizza during dinner hours at select locations, with plans to expand pizza to all locations. The pizza comes in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes in either plain or with an assortment of toppings.

==Store locations==

Wawa operates stores in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Wawa&#x27;s territory once stretched into Northern New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, but in the late 1990s, the decision was made to abandon the franchised stores in the New York metropolitan area, as it was too competitive. The abandoned stores were re-branded when they were sold to Krauszer&#x27;s (in Connecticut) and a variety of other convenience retailers, but most are still recognizable as they retain their distinctive &quot;Wawa&quot; design. The company continued to operate numerous stores in Central Jersey and South Jersey, and re-entered North Jersey in 2010, when Wawa opened a new store in Parsippany. Wawa opened its 100th Super Wawa in New Jersey on October 12, 2012, in Woodbridge. Wawa moved farther into North Jersey opening in Kearny on January 11, 2013, and Lodi on October 4, 2013. The company plans to open five Wawas a year in North Jersey for the next 10 to 12 years.

On July 18, 2012, Wawa entered the Florida market when it opened its first location in Orlando. It had expanded to more than 70 Florida locations by the end of 2015, with plans for 120 more by 2022.

, Wawa has over 900 locations across Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Florida.

In some Jersey Shore towns, Wawa designs its stores to match the aesthetic, and changes operating procedures to adapt to shore culture. In Cape May, Wawa has a Victorian-themed store. In Wildwood, there is a 1950s-themed store. Additionally, its Princeton University/Princeton train station store went viral on TikTok in 2023 for its &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot; minimalist design.

Wawa opened its largest location at the time in the Farragut Square area of Washington, D.C. on December 14, 2017. On December 14, 2018, Wawa opened a flagship location at 6th Street and Chestnut Street in Center City, Philadelphia. The store, at , is the largest Wawa location and features a living greenery wall, large digital screens, couches, café seating, and two &quot;Philly Firsts&quot; murals.

On December 18, 2020, Wawa opened its first drive-thru at a convenience store/gas station location in Westampton, New Jersey. In September 2020, Wawa began construction on its first drive-thru only location in Falls Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania; this location opened on January 8, 2021.

In 2022, Wawa announced their intentions to expand to North Carolina by 2024. On May 16, 2024, the company opened its first location there, in Kill Devil Hills. The company also announced plans to open stores in the Florida Panhandle (including Panama City, Pensacola, and Tallahassee) and Mobile, Alabama in 2024. Its first store in Alabama opened on April 25, 2024, in Fairhope. Wawa has plans to expand into the Nashville area in Tennessee, with the first location to open in 2025 and plans for up to 40 stores. In 2022, Wawa announced a push into South Central Pennsylvania and specifically Harrisburg (which has long been Sheetz territory), but also has Rutter&#x27;s and Turkey Hill as strong local competitors alongside national competitors such as 7-Eleven and Speedway. In October 2022, Wawa announced it would be expanding into Georgia, with the first location opening in Waycross, by 2024. On December 7, 2022, Wawa announced an expansion into Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio after 2025.

In 2023, the first Ohio location was approved and will be located in Liberty Township, near Cincinnati, and the first Indiana location will be in Noblesville. In 2023, it was announced that up to 40 Kentucky locations would be opened.

Wawa plans to expand into West Virginia, with a groundbreaking ceremony in Inwood scheduled on August 14, 2024.

===Competitors===
Wawa, for the most part, covers parts of Pennsylvania not already served by rival stores such as Sheetz, which Wawa is often compared to due to their similar business models and Pennsylvania roots. This led to a &quot;rivalry&quot; between the two chains among Pennsylvanians, though the two companies themselves have a friendly relationship. The character of the two chains has been described as, &quot;Sheetz is typically louder and flashier, with a more intense vibe than Wawa&#x27;s unassuming, plain and simple appearance. ... But while Sheetz may seem like it has more options, Wawa reminds us that no matter how you are dressed, you are welcome there.&quot; Despite the rivalry, the two stores generally do not compete head-to-head in Pennsylvania, with only a few small overlapping areas in the eastern part of the state served by both chains. In Virginia, both chains share a market in the Greater Richmond and Northern Virginia regions. Wawa&#x27;s planned expansion into South Central Pennsylvania and North Carolina will see more head-to-head competition from both chains, enough where Sheetz subsequently announced more store locations in Western Pennsylvania (where GetGo, 7-Eleven/Speedway, Circle K, and locally based Coen Markets are competitors) to fend off a potential expansion of Wawa into the Pittsburgh market. Maryland-based Royal Farms also shares a market with Wawa in several Mid-Atlantic states.

, according to a survey done by the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Wawa received higher marks in customer satisfaction compared to Sheetz.

==Data breach==
On December 20, 2019, Wawa&#x27;s CEO Chris Gheysens announced that the company had found malicious software on its payment processing servers that affected every location across the country, according to the statement. The malware is believed to have been on the servers since as early as March 4, 2019, and contained on December 12, 2019. It affected approximately 34 million cards.

On December 27, 2019, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported that at least six lawsuits seeking class-action status had been filed against the company in federal court in Philadelphia.

On July 26, 2022, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced an $8 million agreement with Wawa to resolve the data breach.

==Popularity==
Wawa enjoys a level of popularity in the Greater Philadelphia region likened to a cult following. This has been attributed to its focus on service and by its fostering a sense of community, described as, &quot;Somehow, whether because of the goofy name or the iconic Canada goose soaring in the sunset, Wawa succeeded in creating an atmosphere that intimately connects with a broad sense of community.&quot; Wawa CEO Chris Gheysens has attributed this to a slow-growth strategy, comparing Wawa&#x27;s cult popularity with that of stores with similar strategies, such as In-N-Out Burger. 

==Controversies==
Wawa&#x27;s expansion efforts have sometimes met with controversy from local communities. In Coral Gables, Florida, land which was planned to be used for affordable housing was instead approved as a new site for a Wawa gas station.

<text>We Can&#x27;t Dance is the fourteenth studio album by the English rock band Genesis, released on 11 November 1991 by Virgin Records in the UK and a day later by Atlantic Records in the US. It is their last studio album recorded with drummer and singer Phil Collins before his departure in 1996 to pursue solo projects full time. The album marked the return of band activity following an almost four-year hiatus after touring their previous album, &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; (1986).
&quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; was a worldwide commercial success for the band. It became the band&#x27;s fifth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK and reached No. 4 in the US, where it sold over 4 million copies. Between 1991 and 1993, six tracks from the album were released as singles, including &quot;No Son of Mine&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;. The latter received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals in 1993. Genesis toured in support of &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; from May to November 1992, playing large stadiums and arenas across North America and Europe.

==Background==
In July 1987, the Genesis line-up of drummer and singer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, and bassist and guitarist Mike Rutherford wrapped their 1986–1987 world tour in support of their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; (1986). The 112-date tour, attended by an estimated 3.5 million people, was extremely taxing on the group, particularly for Rutherford following his father&#x27;s death and almost losing his son Harry due to a difficult birth. The band then entered a three-and-a-half-year period of inactivity, during which each member continued with his respective solo projects. Collins achieved further worldwide commercial success following the release of his solo album &quot;...But Seriously&quot; (1989), while Rutherford&#x27;s band, Mike and the Mechanics, had also begun to have hits. Banks and Rutherford expected Collins to leave the band during this time, but he stayed on to record another Genesis studio album with them. The band had initially agreed to enter production in 1990, but it was pushed to 1991 because of Collins&#x27;s lengthy solo tour. The album&#x27;s title derived partly from the popularity of dance music and its presence in the charts at the time.

==Recording==

Genesis recorded &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; from March to September 1991 at their private recording studio named The Farm in Chiddingfold, Surrey. The trio were keen to work together after such an extensive break, and after two-and-a-half months of what Collins described as &quot;chopping away, fine-tuning, and honing down all these ideas&quot;, they had completed some fifteen tracks. They originally considered releasing a double album, but realised most people would be listening to their work on CD which gave them the additional time they wanted to present more of their musical ideas. As with &quot;Genesis&quot; (1983) and &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, none of the material on &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; was conceived beforehand, and the band instead developed songs through lengthy improvisational jams in the studio. This was a deciding factor for Collins to remain in the band despite his solo success as he enjoyed the task of writing songs with his bandmates from nothing. A typical session would involve Banks and Rutherford playing chords on the keyboard or guitar, respectively, with Collins devising a drum pattern with a drum machine, which allows him to sing notes and dummy lyrics. The words he sang may then be used to form a lyric or help create atmosphere for the song.

Genesis authorised the filming of some recording sessions for the first time for their &quot;No Admittance&quot; documentary, which aired on national television. Banks later admitted that the band avoided &quot;any creative work&quot; with the film crew present because they found it difficult, adding: &quot;As soon as they were there, we shut off&quot;. Collins supported his view and pointed out a change in the atmosphere of working when someone from the filming crew entered the room.

In a departure from their previous albums, Rutherford avoided playing a guitar synthesiser and only plays a Fender Stratocaster and two Steinbergers, one of them a GM series model that was new for the time, but on the song &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, he is playing a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar. He had asked the manufacturer to customise one with a larger body to suit his tall frame but they declined, leaving him to use a cardboard cutout of a body he wished for and sending it to luthier Roger Giffin to make it. He played all his guitar parts with a Groove Tubes amplifier that was suggested to him by his roadie and technician Geoff Banks.

For recording, they enlisted then 28-year-old Nick Davis as co-producer and engineer who had previously worked with Banks and Rutherford on their solo projects, with the band also handling production duties. This marked the end of their association with Hugh Padgham which had begun with &quot;Abacab&quot; (1981). Rutherford said the group decided to switch producers before work on the album had begun, and insisted they were pleased with Padgham&#x27;s contributions, but felt it was the right time for a change after having done three albums with him (Padgham had also produced Collins&#x27;s four solo albums throughout the 1980s). Davis was keen to feature Rutherford&#x27;s guitar more prominently as an instrument than previous Genesis albums, and felt his approach was successful on some of the tracks on &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;. Banks took a liking to some of Davis&#x27;s strong opinions towards certain aspects of recording and instruments which presented him the challenge of finding other ways of recording.

Following a six-week break during the summer of 1991 the band reconvened and completed the mixing in late September, selecting a final 12-track running order that spanned 71 minutes. Banks said that compared to the more direct nature of &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, the style of &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; offered more of a sense of mystery with effort put into each track having its own &quot;individual quality&quot;, yet have an atmosphere that runs through the entire album.

==Songs==
In a similar way to the writing of &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, the band initially allocated roughly one third of the album to each member, who was then responsible for the lyrics to their collection of songs. Banks said having one person work on a set of lyrics was a better way of carrying an idea through. In the end, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; saw Collins contribute a greater amount of lyrics than before; his efforts praised by Rutherford who considered his words for its songs among his best in Genesis history. Collins went further and rated his lyrics on &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; as some of the best of his career and said, &quot;Obviously, the music stimulated me&quot;. In a week during which Banks and Rutherford left the studio for promotional work, Collins started to write lyrical ideas; according to Rutherford &quot;he just couldn&#x27;t stop himself after that. He found he had dead time on his hands.&quot;

Several songs deal with serious matters and social issues. &quot;No Son of Mine&quot; tackles the subject of the domestic abuse of a 15-year-old boy, which originated with Collins repeating the phrase &quot;no son of mine&quot; as a dummy lyric during the writing sessions, rather than a song concerning social commentary.

&quot;Dreaming While You Sleep&quot; concerns a hit-and-run driver and his guilt after failing to stop at the scene of the accident. The former contains a sample of a sound that Rutherford achieved as he was &quot;messing about bending two notes&quot; that Banks had recorded from a microphone on his E-mu Emulator which he then sampled and slowed down, creating a noise he compared to an elephant&#x27;s trumpeting. 

The ten-minute &quot;Driving The Last Spike&quot; is about 19th-century Irish navvies who helped built the railways in the UK, and the poor and unsafe working conditions they had to endure. Collins wrote it after being given a book on the subject by a correspondent who sought to produce a television show about it. Banks used a Hammond organ patch on the track, which referenced his prominent use of the instrument early in Genesis&#x27; career. 

The other long track, &quot;Fading Lights&quot;, came out of group improvisation and it is sort of a goodbye song from Phil to the band Genesis, he left after the tour for this album. 

&quot;Since I Lost You&quot; was written by Collins for his friend Eric Clapton, following the death of the guitarist&#x27;s son Conor, on 20 March 1991. Banks and Rutherford were the only members in the studio that day, and played what music they had written to Collins the following day. Collins said, &quot;Straight away, I was singing the things you hear on the record&quot;, and wrote a set of lyrics based on the incident, not revealing what they were about to his bandmates until he had finished them. Some lines were from a real-life conversation Collins had with Clapton following the incident. 

&quot;Tell Me Why&quot; criticises the Gulf War and the plight of the Kurdish people in its aftermath. Collins got the idea from a television news report while he was having dinner with his wife and daughter. &quot;So I just mixed my feelings with previous thoughts about Bangladesh and Ethiopia&quot;. Its original working title was &quot;Rickenbacker&quot; after the 12-string Rickenbacker guitar used by Rutherford on the song and known for their distinct &quot;ringing&quot; sound.

The serious material was balanced by shorter and lighter songs. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; was a criticism of models who appeared in jeans adverts popular at the time, and built around a heavy Rutherford guitar riff. Banks noted his electric piano part was one of the most minimal riffs he has played on record and had thought of a style heard on the 1968 song &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright?&quot; by Traffic. 

&quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot; was a barbed parody of the televangelist movement in the US, which the band members had seen while touring the country. 

&quot;Living Forever&quot; deals with a cynical view of society&#x27;s obsession with modern diets and lifestyles. Its original working title was &quot;Hip-Hop Brushes&quot; after Collins acquired new drum disks for his E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and devised a hip-hop oriented drum pattern using its brush sound, as he recalled, in around ten minutes which the group then played from and developed the song from it.

Two songs, &quot;On the Shoreline&quot; and &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot;, were cut from the album due to time constraints; instead, both songs were released as B-sides for the singles &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; and &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot; respectively, as well as appearing in the &quot;Genesis Archive 2: 1976–1992&quot; and &quot;Genesis 1983–1998&quot; box sets.

Among the keyboards Banks plays on the album are the Korg 01/W Music Workstation, Korg Wavestation, Ensoniq VFX, Roland JD-800, Roland Rhodes VK-1000, and E-mu Emulator III; the latter enabled Banks to create samples in stereo.

== Release ==
&quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; was released worldwide on 11 November 1991 on Virgin Records and on 12 November 1991 by Atlantic Records in the United States. The album was a success in the charts, going to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two non-consecutive weeks beginning 23 November 1991 and 22 August 1992. In the United States, it debuted the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number four, the week of 30 November 1991. It stayed at its peak for one week during its 72-week stay on the chart. The album also spawned several hit singles, including &quot;No Son of Mine&quot;, &quot;Hold on My Heart&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; and &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot;, the latter two supported by humorous videos.

On 1 December 1991, the album was certified double Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 600,000 copies. A year later, sales grew to reach quadruple platinum, signifying 1.2 million copies sold. The album reached quintuple platinum status in March 1997, for 1.5 million copies sold. In the United States, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; shipped 1 million copies by 27 December 1991. Five years later, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for four million copies sold.

&quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; was re-released in 2007 as a SACD/DVD set with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Davis. It was also included as part of the band&#x27;s &quot;Genesis 1983–1998&quot; box set.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; chiefly commented on the album&#x27;s lyrics. They criticised &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; and &quot;Way of the World&quot; for being soulless and impersonal social commentaries, but regarded most of the songs as outstanding, and summarised &quot;Although &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite achieve the vulnerable grace of &quot;Duke&quot; or the exuberance of &quot;Abacab&quot;, Genesis has nevertheless delivered an elegantly spare – and even adventurous – album.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a lacklustre review, stating: &quot;At a time when everything is uncertain ... you almost have to admire a record like &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;. ... You know there will be a couple of fleeting moments when the band breaks out of its torpor – for instance, on the very polite primal stomp of &#x27;I Can&#x27;t Dance&#x27; – and that such moments will just as quickly be subsumed by the rest of the musical quicksand.&quot;

In a retrospective assessment, AllMusic also criticised the lyrics of &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; and &quot;Way of the World&quot;, calling them &quot;paeans for world understanding that sound miles away from any immediacy&quot;. However, they praised the album for returning to a less pop-oriented direction, and especially complimented the grittiness of &quot;No Son of Mine&quot;, &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot;, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;. Ultimate Classic Rock ranked &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; as the 14th best album by Genesis, stating &quot;Collins&#x27; final album with Genesis is full of obnoxious, overproduced pop pap; most of the tracks sound like castoffs from one of his solo albums. When the meager charms of a song like &#x27;I Can&#x27;t Dance&#x27; are a highlight, you’re in big trouble.&quot; Stevie Chick of &quot;The Guardian&quot; dismissed the album as &quot;blandness&quot; in a countdown of ten of the best Genesis songs.

The album garnered Genesis an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group and two further nominations for Favorite Adult Contemporary Album and Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist. At the Brit Awards in 1993, the album was nominated for British Album while Phil Collins was nominated as British Male Artist for his contribution to the album.

==Tour==
Genesis supported the album with the 68-date We Can&#x27;t Dance Tour across the United States and Europe from 8 May to 17 November 1992, with their longtime touring musicians Chester Thompson on drums and Daryl Stuermer on bass and lead guitars. It also marked the 25th anniversary of the band, and featured a 20-minute medley of their older material recorded in the 1970s. For the first time since 1978, the setlist did not include &quot;In the Cage&quot; from &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974). Booking agent Mike Farrell said Genesis spent millions of their own earnings to put the tour together.

Designed specifically for stadiums, the set featured a 200 ft-long (60.9 m) stage designed by Marc Brickman and built to the band&#x27;s specifications with 80 ft (24.3 m) sound towers and three 20 x 26 ft (6 x 7.9 m) moveable Sony Jumbotron screens that alone cost $5 million, all needing 42 lorries to transport. The advantages of these was that images from videos or artwork was projected on them to illustrate some songs, while live camera footage of the band gave everyone in the arena a front row view. Collins sang with an in-ear monitoring system which he credited to singing more in tune and more effortlessly than before as he felt he was always &quot;fighting&quot; with the band&#x27;s sound. It also reduced his worry about the condition of his voice on tour. Collins would not tour with Genesis again until he returned in 2006 for their Turn It On Again: The Tour.

Recordings from several dates were released on the live albums &quot;The Way We Walk, Volume One: The Shorts&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Way We Walk, Volume Two: The Longs&quot; (1993). The dates at Earl&#x27;s Court in London were filmed and released as &quot;The Way We Walk - Live in Concert&quot;.

<text>REAL Women of Canada () is a socially conservative advocacy group in Canada. The organization was founded in 1983.

REAL stands for &quot;Realistic, Equal, Active, for Life&quot;. The group believes that the nuclear family is the most important unit in Canadian society, and that the fragmentation of the Canadian family is a primary cause of social disorder. It lobbies the Government of Canada in favour of legislation to promote what it believes to be the Judeo-Christian-Islamic model of family life, and to support homemaking. REAL is also opposed to feminism, abortion and LGBT rights (and same-sex marriage in Canada as well).

==Interventions==
The group has intervened in Supreme Court of Canada cases including &quot;R. v. Morgentaler (1993)&quot; and &quot;M. v. H.&quot; (1999). In &quot;R. v. Sullivan&quot; (1991) it argued that a fetus is a person and the only thing different between a fetus and a baby is a short amount of time.

==Objectives==
According to its website, its aims are to emphasize the importance of the family and legally promote what it refers to as a &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; understanding of marriage and a nuclear family, to promote homemaking, and to oppose abortion and assisted suicide.

Part of their economic policies to help meet their objectives are increased tax relief for single-income families, families with children, and individuals with children.

REAL Women is similar in political and social outlook to Phyllis Schlafly&#x27;s Eagle Forum and to Concerned Women for America in the United States.

The organization has also criticized individuals who have spoken out against Uganda&#x27;s criminalization of homosexual relations. On August 7, 2013, the group issued a statement criticizing Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird for speaking out on LGBT human rights issues in both Uganda and Russia as part of Canada&#x27;s foreign policy.

== History ==

In January 1983, Judy Erola, the federal cabinet minister for the status of women, proposed scrapping the tax exemption for dependent spouses, including mothers at home raising young children. Seeing this change as anti-family, persons active in the anti-abortion campaign began to speak out in opposition. On September 3, 1983, a group of Ontario women formed what would become known as REAL Women: Realistic, Equal, and Active for Life. REAL Women was dissatisfied with how feminist organizations addressed women&#x27;s issues, and said that many housewives felt disparaged and attacked by these organizations. REAL Women was formed as an anti-feminist counterweight to the National Action Committee on the Status of Women. A press conference was held in 1984 officially announcing their formation. The group claimed initially to have 10,000 members, however this was later discredited. The year following their formation, the group held its first national conference, claiming to have 20,000 members, though this could not be verified.

REAL Women said it represented a silent majority of women within Canada. They promoted male-led, single-breadwinner families, and believed that women should be homemakers, mothers and wives. Their views and beliefs greatly differed from the stance taken by the National Action Committee on the Status of Women and its umbrella organizations, and the group argued against the equality guarantees already enacted in the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;: they denounce the equal rights clause in the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and feminist movements and organizations, and they argue that government spending and funding of these feminist organizations is undermining traditional gender and family relations. 1987 its president Lynne Scime stated that &quot;REAL women want to look at issues such as how a woman can pick a husband to fulfill her needs&quot;. They believed that women are naturally nurturing, emotional and dependent beings, suited to motherhood. They use the slogan &quot;equal but different&quot; while pushing for increased tax credits for stay-at-home mothers, . and have made suggestions on how to augment the options and resources available to families.

REAL is directly opposed to issues that organizations such as the National Action Committee advocatet. One is abortion, which REAL opposes, claiming it is murder. In addition, the group opposes the idea of the universal childcare model, as they believe that governmental childcare represents a loss of parental control and increases the influence of the state on the family. They argue that the funding would be better spent on things such as courses on parenting skills. REAL also oppose laws guaranteeing equal pay for women, believing that this would reduce the income disparity between genders, draw women into the paid labour force, and incentivize the economic position of female-led households. They believe this represents a major threat to family values, demeans women and breaks down the traditional family. They also believe that women taking men&#x27;s jobs will destroy the free market economy. Other viewpoints they oppose include programs to reduce family violence, which they claim encourage hatred toward men; no-fault divorce; and human rights protections for gays and lesbians. The overarching goal of REAL Women is to support the way of life traditionally associated with the 1950s nuclear family and arch-conservative values. Their belief is that their activism contributes to women&#x27;s equality and will improve their lives. Their monthly newsletter, &quot;Real&quot;ity, mirrors the American conservative movement. It regularly attacks feminists such as Flora MacDonald as well as feminist campaigns.

REAL Women of Canada endorsed Derek Sloan as candidate in the 2020 Conservative leadership election.

<text>The Duan () was a tribe of Xianbei ethnicity during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms in China. They were a powerful tribe in the Liaoxi region and played a key role during the fall of the Western Jin dynasty. Unlike the Xianbei tribes of the steppe, the Duan were unique in that they were established within the borders of China. They ruled over their dukedom of Liaoxi and later established the Duan Qi state, although neither were considered part of the Sixteen Kingdoms. The tribe was conquered by the Murong-led Former Yan in 338, but remained politically influential as maternal relatives of the Murong. 

==History==

=== Background ===
The Duan tribe was founded within the Great Wall at Liaoxi Commandery, where the Wuhuan tribes once resided as vassals to the Han dynasty. Following their defeat at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207, the power of the Wuhuan gradually declined as they were scattered and assimilated with the surrounding Han Chinese and Xianbei.

The founder of the Duan tribe was said to be Rilujuan (or Jiulujuan), a Xianbei slave of a Wuhuan family in Yuyang Commandery, the Kunuguan (庫辱官). When a famine broke out in Yuyang, the Kunuguan sent him to Liaoxi to scour for food, but he instead took the opportunity to escape. He gathered a group of exiles and rebels to establish a base at Lingzhi (令支, in present-day Qian&#x27;an, Hebei), a city that had been abandoned during the Han dynasty. They adopted the Han Chinese family name of &quot;Duan&quot; (段) as their tribe&#x27;s name. Rilujuan was succeeded by his younger brother Qizhen, who was then succeeded by his son, Duan Wuwuchen. By the Western Jin dynasty, the tribe had grown to 30,000 families and had around 45,000 cavalry under their wing. The Duan under Wuwuchen were recognized as a vassal by the Jin court.

=== Liaoxi dukedom (303–338) ===

During the War of the Eight Princes, the Jin Chief Controller of You province, Wang Jun sought to secure his position by allying with the surrounding Xianbei and Wuhuan people. He entered a marriage alliance with Duan Wuwuchen, offering him a fiefdom as the &quot;Duke of Liaoxi&quot; in return for his tribe&#x27;s military service. Wang Jun&#x27;s barbarian auxiliaries were a deciding factor in the civil wars, with the Duan playing a role in his victory against the Prince of Chengdu, Sima Ying in 304. The Duan continued to support Wang Jun in his war against the Xiongnu state of Han-Zhao, battling the Jie warlord, Shi Le with much success. Wuwuchen died in around 310, succeeded by his son, Duan Jilujuan.

In 313, after some negotiations, Jilujuan agreed with Shi Le to break off relations with Wang Jun and withdraw from the conflict. Wang Jun was defeated by Shi Le in 314, but soon after, Jilujuan&#x27;s brother, Duan Pidi, led a branch of the Duan loyal to Jin and seized control of Wang Jun&#x27;s old capital in Jicheng. The Duan was effectively split into two, but civil war only broke out following the death of Jilujuan in 318. That year, Jilujuan&#x27;s cousin, Duan Mopei, seized power from his uncle, Duan Shefuchen, and fought with Pidi over full control of the tribe.

In 321, Pidi was captured and later killed by Shi Le&#x27;s state of Later Zhao, making Mopei the sole leader of the Duan. At this point, the Duan&#x27;s state of Liaoxi stretched from Yuyang Commandery to the Liao River. After Mopei died in 325, his brother and successor, Duan Ya was quickly overthrown by his cousin, Duan Liao after he attempted to move the capital. Throughout his reign, Duan Liao fought with the rival Murong-Xianbei tribe in Liaodong, but suffered repeated losses. In 338, the Murong, who by now had established the Former Yan, allied with the Later Zhao to destroy the Duan. Duan Liao was defeated and surrendered to Former Yan, thus ending the Duan&#x27;s independent state.

=== Later history ===
While Duan Liao was killed for rebelling in 339, the Duan remained a prominent family within the Former Yan and their successors states of Later Yan, Western Yan and Southern Yan as maternal relatives due to a number of their women such as Duan Yuanfei and Duan Jifei marrying into the Murong family. Other Duan members fled to Later Zhao where they became generals, most notably Duan Lan and Duan Qin. During the collapse of the Later Zhao, Duan Lan&#x27;s son, Duan Kan, founded the short-lived Duan Qi state in Shandong in 350, while Duan Qin declared himself the Emperor of Zhao in 352. However, both were eventually captured and executed by the Former Yan.

==Chieftains of the Duan==
==Language==

Shimunek classifies Duan as a &quot;Serbi&quot; (i.e., para-Mongolic) language. Shimunek&#x27;s &quot;Serbi&quot; linguistic branch also includes Taghbach, Tuyuhun, and Khitan.

<text>Crito ( or ; ) is a dialogue written by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. It depicts a conversation between Socrates and his wealthy friend Crito of Alopece regarding justice (&quot;δικαιοσύνη&quot;), injustice (&quot;ἀδικία&quot;), and the appropriate response to injustice. It follows Socrates&#x27; imprisonment, just after the events of the &quot;Apology&quot;.

In &quot;Crito&quot;, Socrates believes injustice may not be answered with injustice, personifies the Laws of Athens to prove this, and refuses Crito&#x27;s offer to finance his escape from prison. The dialogue contains an ancient statement of the social contract theory of government. In contemporary discussions, the meaning of &quot;Crito&quot; is debated to determine whether it is a plea for unconditional obedience to the laws of a society. The text is one of the few Platonic dialogues that appear to be unaffected by Plato&#x27;s opinions on the matter; it is dated to have been written around the same time as the &quot;Apology&quot;.

== Background ==
Following his trial in the &quot;Apology&quot;, Socrates had been imprisoned for four weeks and would be executed in a matter of days. Historians are not aware of the exact location of Socrates&#x27; cell but according to archaeologists, the ancient Athenian prison is about southwest of the Heliaia court, just outside the site of the agora.

Plato&#x27;s representation of Socrates is intimate but because it is a literary work, the historical validity of what was said and how much of Plato&#x27;s interpretation of Socrates aligns with his real beliefs is uncertain.

Socrates and Crito are the only characters in the story. Crito was a rich Athenian who like Socrates was from the deme of Alopece. Once Socrates was charged with corrupting the youth and impiety, Crito unsuccessfully vouched to pay his bail. To spare him the prison sentence after Socrates was sentenced to death, Crito was ready to pledge to the court that Socrates would not flee, a plea that was ultimately rejected. Through both the trial and the execution, Crito was present.

In other dialogues, Crito is portrayed as a conventional Athenian who could not understand Socrates&#x27; philosophy despite his attempts to do so.

In research published in 2009, Holger Thesleff doubted &quot;Crito&#x27;s&quot; authenticity. However, unlike many of Plato&#x27;s potential works, &quot;Crito&quot; is widely considered to be a genuine dialogue. Some researchers have said &quot;Crito&quot; is part of Plato&#x27;s middle dialogues, which are characterised by a Socrates who dismantled opposing arguments by asking questions and then pointing out the flaws in the opposition&#x27;s theory. However, consensus places it in his early bibliography, which is characterised by a Socrates who speaks as an expert on the subject.

According to Mario Montuori and Giovanni Reale, &quot;Crito&quot; was written closer in time to the &quot;Laws&quot; than to the &quot;Apology&quot;, whose date is controversial. The piece was written after Socrates&#x27; execution in 399 BCE.

According to Xenophon, Plato&#x27;s friends drafted escape plans. The extent the theoretical plan aligned with the historical ones is unknown. Some historians of philosophy assume the Socratic figure depicted in &quot;Crito&quot; is similar to the historical figure. William K. C. Guthrie considers the social contract to be true to Socrates&#x27; philosophical interests.

== Summary ==

=== Crito&#x27;s arguments ===
In the early morning, before visitors may arrive to meet with prisoners, Crito arrives at Socrates&#x27; cell and bribes the guard for entry. Once inside, he sits beside Socrates until he wakes up. Upon waking, Socrates remarks that Crito arrived early. Crito expresses concern at Socrates&#x27; relaxed attitude to his upcoming execution. Socrates responds that he is almost 70 years old and that to be scared of death would be inappropriate.

Crito has come to see Socrates because he has learned his execution will take place the next day, and wishes to rescue his friend. Crito planned to bribe all of the guards who are part of the execution and assures Socrates he has enough money to see the plan through and that he has additional friends who are also willing to pay. After being rescued from prison, Socrates would be taken to a home in Thessaly, where Crito and his friends would be pleased to house and feed him.

Crito asserts that if Socrates is executed, Crito will suffer a personal misfortune through the loss of a great friend. Crito also says if Socrates is executed, his sons will be deprived of the privileges to which the sons of a philosopher would be entitled—a proper education and living conditions. He also points out that when one takes on the responsibility of having children, it is immoral to abandon that duty. Additionally, if Socrates did not go with them, it will reflect poorly upon Crito and his friends because people would believe they were too miserly to save Socrates. Crito also claims that it is important that they consider the thoughts of the majority as they &quot;can inflict … the greatest evils if one is slandered among them&quot;. Finally, Crito argues that Socrates should not worry about the potential punishments that he and his conspirators could face as they feel that the risk is worth taking. 

=== Socrates&#x27; arguments ===
After hearing Crito&#x27;s arguments, Socrates asks to be allowed to respond with a discussion of related, open-ended issues, to which Crito may not respond. As Socrates continues with his arguments, Crito only affirms Socrates&#x27; words. Socrates first says the opinions of the educated should be taken into consideration and that the opinions of those with subjective biases or beliefs may be disregarded. Likewise, the popularity of an opinion does not make it valid. Socrates uses the analogy of an athlete listening to his physician rather than his supporters because the physician&#x27;s knowledge makes his opinion more valuable. According to Socrates, damage to the soul in the form of injustice makes life worthless for a philosopher in the same way life for a person who has injured himself out of incompetence is pointless. A person&#x27;s goal should be to live a virtuous and just life rather than a long one, thus escape from the prison would rely on a discussion on justice.

Socrates disregards Crito&#x27;s fears of a damaged reputation and his children&#x27;s futures, which are irrelevant to him. He compares such motivations to a person who sentences someone to death and then regrets the action. Socrates then says Crito and his friends should know better because they have shared the same principles for a long time and that abandoning them at their age would be childish. To wrong the state, even in reaction to an injustice, would be an injustice.

=== Laws and justice ===
Socrates then points out the question would then be whether he should harm someone or ignore a just obligation. To solve this question, he creates a personification of the Laws of Athens and speaks through its point of view, which is to defend the state and its decision against Socrates. 

According to Socrates, the Laws would argue a state cannot exist without respect for its rules. They would criticise Socrates for believing he and every other citizen had the right to ignore court judgements because chaos could ensue. Thus, Socrates could refute this particular instance as an unjust decision of the law, while maintaining that the law itself is just and should be obeyed. Socrates could justify his disobeying this legal ruling as just on these grounds. This argument, which is mirrored in Martin Luther King’s argument on unjust laws, is perhaps the best answer to the form of social contract theory that Socrates puts forward. However, Crito is never allowed to make this argument because Socrates cuts him off. 

According to the Laws, if Socrates had accepted Crito&#x27;s offer, he would have exposed his accomplices to the risk of fleeing or losing their assets. As a fugitive in a well-established state, good citizens would be suspicious of Socrates because he would be suspected of violating the laws in his place of exile. He would have to be content with a region like Thessaly, which was chaotic and disorganised, and where he could only entertain crowds with the story of his unjust escape. As a philosopher who had become unfaithful to his principles, he would be discredited and would have to give up his previous life content and his sense of life would only be through food. 

In conclusion, if Socrates accepts his execution, he will be wronged by men rather than the law, remaining just. If he takes Crito&#x27;s advice and escapes, Socrates would wrong the laws and betray his lifelong pursuit of justice. After completing the imaginary plea of the Laws, Socrates claims he was chained to the laws as a dancer is to flute music and asks Crito to rebuff him if he wishes. Crito has no objections. Before Crito leaves, Socrates refers to the divine guidance he hopes to be helped by.

== Philosophical implications ==
&quot;Crito&quot; emphasises reason, which it says should be the sole criterion for understanding ethics. Unlike Plato&#x27;s other works, Socrates took a more objective stance on epistemology, being optimistic about the knowledge coming from experts in a subject.

The ethical and political implications of the Laws are barely discussed in &quot;Crito&quot;, in which the Laws are personified to explain the way Socrates should have behaved.

=== Social contract ===
The personification of the Laws is contrary to Plato&#x27;s tendency to criticise the Athenian state and institutions. The state&#x27;s demand for loyalty was a social contract theory in which citizens have a mutual agreement with the state and understand what being a citizen of the state entails. A person only became a citizen after undertaking a test called &quot;dokimasia&quot; (δοκιμασία); citizenship was not conferred at birth. The test is mentioned in &quot;Crito&quot;.

=== Legalism ===
One of the most controversial issues raised by &quot;Crito&quot; is Socrates&#x27; legalist representation of the laws as a human being. It presents a view of society in which citizens who are incapable of changing laws by convincing lawmakers have to abide by the laws to remain &quot;just&quot;. Those who do not want to live under such laws are to emigrate if they desire an ethical life. Although Socrates ultimately rejects the idea of expulsion, he believes it to be ethical because the court had suggested it and because the ruling was unjust. It followed, however, from the overall context of Platonic ethics in the sense that it priorities the avoidance of injustice.

=== Authoritarian and liberal interpretations ===
Sandrine Bergès proposed a Liberal interpretation of the law in which the agreement between the state and the individual implies a mutual obligation. The legislation provides the citizens&#x27; livelihoods and an environment conducive to their prosperity and so they consider themselves to be loyal to the laws. Prosperity, in the sense of Socrates, means the formation of character – the acquisition of virtue as a prerequisite for a good life. In this sense, the analogy of the relationship between parent and child is to be understood as parents having the obligation to educate their children to be good people and can expect their children&#x27;s obedience in return. The laws promote the virtue of citizens and should therefore be respected. In both cases, the parent entity must fulfil its obligation to be eligible for obedience. In the relationship between Socrates and the Athenian laws, this was the case despite the judgement of the court. If it was otherwise, there would be no obligation to comply with the laws. 

According to Richard Kraut, the laws required a serious effort to command respect. If this attempt was to fail, civil disobedience would be permissible. A number of critics, however, argue this could not be inferred from the text; rather, in the event of a failure of the conviction attempt, unconditional obedience to the law was demanded.

The Liberal interpretation of the personified laws has been controversial but one measuring &quot;authoritarian&quot; starting points to a Liberal outcome has found favour in recent research. The representatives of this approach assume the personification of the laws is to be understood in an authoritarian sense but either disagrees or partially agrees with Socrates&#x27; own position. Thus, although Plato&#x27;s Socrates makes a case for this authoritarian rule, his order of values differed from their own.

Although Socrates is impressed by the reasoning of the laws, according to the weaker version of this hypothesis this does not mean he identifies with all of his reflections and affirms their consequences. According to the stronger variant, he agrees to the laws only with regard to the result – the refusal to flee – but rejects the way in which they have come to the conclusion. In principle his approval of the ethical understanding of the laws is not serious but ironic.

According to representatives of this interpretation Socrates, at the end of the dialogue, compares the effect the pleading of the Laws has on him with the &quot;frenzied dervishes of Cybele seem to hear the flutes&quot;. This was an irrational aspect that contrasts with the philosophical demand for unconditional reason. In Plato&#x27;s works, Socrates appears as a philosopher who always acts rationally and stuns admirers with his extraordinary self-restraint while being exposed to strong emotions. The comparison with these &quot;dervishes&quot; is an indication there is a difference between the radical, suggestive demands of the law and Socrates&#x27; philosophically reflected position. Socrates&#x27; description of his emotion is ironic as in &quot;Apology&quot;, his defence speech to court, in which he ironically claims the persuasive power of his prosecutors has almost led him to forget himself.

The strong variant of the interpretation, which distinguishes Socrates&#x27; point of view from that of the Laws, is represented by Roslyn Weiss. She said although the dialogue&#x27;s Crito is an old friend of Socrates and should have known Socratic ethics well, his reflections and reactions show he is not a philosophical man. According to Weiss&#x27;s hypothesis, this was the reason Socrates let the Laws appear and assigns them the task of making it understandable to Crito – that is, authoritarian – that an escape would be wrong. Weiss saw this as an indication Socrates only introduces the Laws after Crito has told him he could not follow Socrates&#x27; philosophical argument. As a further indication, Weiss says Socrates describes the arguments as being in favour of respecting the law – like something a speaker would present. This expresses distancing because the Platonic Socrates generally rejects rhetoric as a dishonest, manipulative way of persuasion.

Thomas Alexander Szlezák also said the justification for Socrates&#x27; attitude towards his friend is emotional rather than not philosophically demanding because it is inevitably based on Crito&#x27;s level of reflection. The crucial point for Socrates is in the &quot;Phaedo&quot; dialogue rather than &quot;Crito&quot;. Socrates in &quot;Crito&quot; avoids using the word &quot;soul&quot; – a concept that is introduced and discussed in various dialogues – and dealt with a metaphysically neutral paraphrase, apparently because Crito does not accept the philosophical assumption of an immortal soul.

According to David Bostock, the authoritarian concept is the exact view Plato wanted to convey in &quot;Crito&quot;. In later works Plato recognized the problems with this position and modified his point of view. A number of other commentators support the traditional interpretation that the position of the Laws was to identify with the Platonic Socrates.

=== Lawfulness and ethical autonomy ===
Multiple researchers have claimed that there is a purposeful rhetorical incongruity between the &quot;Apology&quot; and &quot;Crito&quot; from Plato&#x27;s representation of Socrates&#x27; dialogues. In &quot;the Apology&quot;, Socrates explained that he would not obey a hypothetical court verdict that forced him to renounce public philosophising on pain of death, for such a demand would be an injustice to him.

Michael Roth claimed that there was no inconsistency, and that the real in &quot;Crito&quot; and the hypothetical in the &quot;Apology&quot; were two fundamentally different systems to be held to different standards. According to another solution, Socrates&#x27; argument in the &quot;Apology&quot; was of a purely theoretical nature, since a prohibition of philosophy had no legal basis and no situation was conceivable in which the court could have actually imposed such a penalty on Socrates, unless the defendant had proposed this himself.

Italian historians of philosophy Mario Montuori and Giovanni Reale used chronological distance to explain this difference: that The &quot;Apology&quot; and the &quot;Crito&quot; were written at different times and for different reasons. In the &quot;Apology&quot; — which was the younger work — Plato essentially reported what Socrates had said without much embellishment, but when writing &quot;Crito&quot;, he had given his thoughts on the matter through the mask of Socrates.

On the other hand, if Socrates&#x27; punishment could not occur, professor of morality Necip Fikri Alican argued that Socrates could not simply just be using meaningless thought experiments. Philosophy professor James Stephens simply believed the problem has no solution.

=== The (missing) soul ===
The soul is oddly missing throughout the &quot;Crito&quot;. This is despite the fact that Francis Cornford referred to the Platonic doctrine of the soul as one of the &quot;twin pillars of Platonism,&quot; with the other being the theory of Forms. There seems to have been a deep uncertainty regarding the soul in the &quot;Crito&quot;. Socrates in the &quot;Crito&quot; alludes to the soul when he mentions the part of us that has justice or injustice inside it, but he does not even name it as the soul (47e–48a). This has puzzled scholars for centuries. Scholars have tended to suppose that Plato, at this early point in his career, simply has not yet worked out all the features of the soul: is it a self-mover, the principle of life? Is it the bearer of moral properties? Is it a mind? Erwin Rohde argued that Plato simply did not yet know what the soul was. David Claus conducted a thorough survey of all mentions of and references to the soul in pre-Platonic Greek literature (such as the sophists, natural philosophers, tragedians, comedians, and medical writers) and concluded that Plato was the first to combine all the features of the soul into one concept, but that this conception of the soul did not take place in Plato&#x27;s mind until the &quot;Laws&quot;; the absence of the soul from the &quot;Crito&quot; reflects the inchoate status of the soul at this point in Plato&#x27;s intellectual development. Campbell agrees that Plato was the first, but he argues that Plato&#x27;s psychology was developed earlier, such that readers of earlier dialogues such as the &quot;Phaedo&quot; can observe the casual oscillation between different roles that the soul plays; he maintains that the soul is a thinker and a mover at the same time because it moves things by means of its thoughts.

== Interpretations and reception ==

=== Classical and medieval ===
Roman philosopher and politician Cicero interpreted &quot;Crito&quot; to mean citizens are obliged to serve the state out of gratitude.

In anti-Platonic circles, the piece was not well regarded. The philosopher Athenaeus said &quot;Crito&quot; serves as Plato&#x27;s means of attacking the real-life Crito. Athenaeus said because Crito showed no philosophical ability, his inability to present a proper argument is to be expected. Another anti-Platonic author, the Epicurean Idomenus of Lampsacus, said the escape plan came from Aeschines of Sphettus rather than Crito and the names were transposed Aeschines was not favored by Plato.

=== Early modern ===
The oldest manuscript of &quot;Crito&quot; was produced in 895 CE in Byzantium. In the Latin-speaking world, &quot;Crito&quot; was an unknown work but the Islamic world had produced translations of it for years. The Western world rediscovered &quot;Crito&quot; during the age of Renaissance humanism. The first Latin translation was made in 1410 by the Italian humanist and statesman Leonardo Bruni, who was not satisfied with this translation and worked upon another that was completed by 1427. Bruni was so satisfied with the arguments presented by the Laws that he had used them in his own work, &quot;De militia&quot;. A revision of Bruni&#x27;s Latin translation was created by Rinuccio da Castiglione. Marsilio Ficino was the third humanist translator; he published the translation in Florence in 1484. The first edition of the Greek text was published in September 1513 in Venice by Aldo Manuzio in the complete edition of Plato&#x27;s works, which was published by Marcus Musurus.

The philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) made reference to &quot;Crito&quot; as the only ancient text that holds the idea of a citizen&#x27;s implicit promise of loyalty. He said Plato&#x27;s Socrates founded the social contract in the manner of Whigs and influences passive obedience as seen from the Tories.

=== Modern ===

==== Literary aspects ====
&quot;Crito&quot; was esteemed by literary analysts including Paul Shorey, William Guthrie, and Thomas Alexander Szlezák, the last of whom said its &quot;speech, argumentation and character are masterfully matched&quot;. Translator and philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher said in his translation&#x27;s introduction the work is not a dialogue invented by Plato but rather a successful conversation he had.

==== Philosophical aspects ====
The philologist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff found no philosophical content in &quot;Crito&quot;. According to him, the dialogue teaches &quot;about the duty of the citizen, but not in the abstract, rather Socratic; Athenian&quot;. Gabriel Danzig states the text presents Socrates as an &quot;embarrassingly obedient and dutiful citizen&quot;; in doing so, Plato wanted to justify him &quot;to the good citizens who did not care about philosophy&quot;.

Danzig added that in contemporary specialist literature, Plato is considered to be only concerned with making Socrates understandable to his readers rather than philosophically presenting and justifying universal principles. Olof Gigon saw the dialogue as a light work that is welcoming to aspiring philosophers. Despite this, the work was regarded as a key Western parallel to Legalism according to philosopher Reginald E. Allen. Hellmut Flashar argued that despite its initial appearances, &quot;Crito&quot; depth can be discerned through dialogue and that in doing so, it may be revealed as a difficult text.

In modern discussions of law and order, the responsibilities of citizens to follow rules unconditionally has many commonalities with &quot;Crito&quot;&#x27;s presentation of Crito&#x27;s lenient understanding of the Laws and Socrates&#x27; rigid one. The text is a foundation in Anglo-Saxon studies on legal ethics. According to Flashar, attempting to apply modern ideas to Platonic philosophy estranges the themes.

The quality of the Laws&#x27; arguments are relative to one&#x27;s interpretation; in research literature, those who interpret the piece as being &quot;authoritarian&quot; view the Laws as having a weak argument which is based more on feeling than rationality. For instance, the metaphor of one&#x27;s parents being a parallel to the state implies a debatable view of obligation rather than an objective one. Some have said that Socrates is a vessel for Plato&#x27;s beliefs. Defenders of the piece say that this view ignores the possibility that the arguments&#x27; weaknesses are inherent to the dialectical process. Romano Guardini emphasised the &quot;Crito&quot; inherent correctness, it being &quot;the basic philosophical experience of validity&quot; exists beyond empiricism.

According to Austrian philosopher Karl Popper, the representation of Socrates in &quot;Crito&quot; is the quintessential version of him and the piece may have been a request by Socrates himself. In tandem with the &quot;Apology&quot;, Socrates&#x27; last will may be formed. Socrates, who was convicted as an Athenian, chose not to flee Athens because of his virtue as an Athenian and the loyalty to the state that follows. If he chose to go into self-exile as Crito had suggested, he would undermine the fundamental system the state he pledges allegiance to was based upon. Peter Sloterdijk said &quot;Crito&quot; is one of the &quot;initial texts of philosophy par excellence&quot; with which Plato founded &quot;a new way of looking for the truth&quot;. Crito was the defender of this world against the death of his master. He played a &quot;half ridiculous, half moving role&quot;. For Socrates, life was a lesson so he consequently &quot;turned his last breath into an argument and his last hour into evidence&quot;.

<text>Newmarket () is an Auckland suburb to the south-east of the central business district. With its high building density, especially of retail shops, it is considered New Zealand&#x27;s premier retailing area, and a rival of local competitor Auckland CBD.

While as early as 1873, Newmarket has been referred to as a &#x27;suburb&#x27; of Auckland, in fact until the amalgamation of the borough councils into Auckland City Council in 1989, local governance was by the Newmarket Borough Council, with its own mayor. The borough, while one of the smallest in the Auckland Region, was also one of the busiest. This is especially true of Broadway, the main street, which has large shopping centres and smaller retail tenancies (with a total of over 400 stores as of mid-2010), two movie theatres, and numerous restaurants, bars, and cafés.

== History ==

===Māori beginnings===
Tāmaki Māori called this area, particularly the south of the current Newmarket, Te Tī Tūtahi, &#x27;the cabbage tree standing alone&#x27; or &#x27;the cabbage tree of singular importance&#x27;, referring to a tree which stood on the corner of Mortimer Pass and Broadway (according to other references at the corner of Clovernook Road and Broadway) until 1908. Some of the cabbage trees in the area are descended from this tree, after Alfred Buckland rescued a portion and replanted trees around Newmarket and as far away as Bucklands Beach.

In the general area of Nuffield Street / Mahuru Street, no remnants today are visible of the Mahuru Spring, once sacred to the local Māori iwi. It is noted that the spring was named after the Māori word for the &quot;season&quot; of spring.

===European settlement===

The earliest subdivision of land in this location took place in June 1841. In 1842 Epsom Road was formed, running from the bottom of town up through Parnell towards the middle of the Auckland isthmus. This was later called Manukau Road before being given its current name, Parnell Road. The position of Newmarket at the start of several major roads to the east and south, including Great South Road, was to strongly influence its character as a transport hub and &quot;Gateway to the South&quot;.

In 1845 Khyber Pass Road was formed and the intersection of these three roads was called &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Bridge&quot; referring to a small wooden bridge that crossed over &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (more or less where the railway track passes near the Olympic Swimming Pool). A very small bridge was the most noteworthy landmark of the area, giving some idea of the rather empty nature of the landscape.

Around 1851 this area received the name Newmarket because it was the site of the &#x27;New Market&#x27; for livestock. Farmers would drive their stock up the Manukau, Great South, or Remuera Roads to the market which was better situated than the earlier stock market in Auckland proper. The presence of the Newmarket railway station connecting it with Auckland, opened in 1873 after the completion of the first Parnell Tunnel, was also a great advantage. The market was located to the south of Remuera Road and east of Manukau Road.

Overlooking Newmarket on a bluff to the south east is a 19th-century wooden house in the Gothic style called Highwic. The home of a local businessman Alfred Buckland, Highwic is now owned by the Auckland Council and administered by Heritage New Zealand. Another piece of Auckland land owned by Alfred Buckland located further out of town is still called &quot;Bucklands Beach&quot;.

===Thriving suburb===
The main road of Newmarket is called Broadway. Originally Manukau Road, it was renamed Broadway in late 1912 by the Newmarket Borough Council to reflect the fact that it was no longer a muddy, dusty slushy street. The Broadway Cinema opened in 1911 as the Adelphi Theatre and changed its name in early 1915. The picture hall was a brick and corrugated iron shed linked by a passage to a retail block on Broadway. The cinema lasted until late 1925. Like its New York namesake, Newmarket&#x27;s Broadway developed a rather bright &#x27;Moderne&#x27; flashy image in the 1930s and 1940s and by the 1960s had the biggest collection of neon signs in the country.

The Olympic Swimming Pool was constructed in 1939 to the designs of the borough engineer N. F. Alcock. This Art deco building was opened by the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Hon William Parry in 1940. As well as being the borough&#x27;s only public amenity the Olympic sized swimming pool was a great asset for the whole of Auckland. Over the years it has been well used and facilitated the hosting of many sporting events by Auckland including the Empire Games in 1950. Recently the pool&#x27;s streamline art deco form was considerably changed when a cinema complex was built over the pool, which was previously open to the sky. To the north of the Olympic Swimming Pools is the Olympic Park War Memorial.

Located to the south of the Olympic Pools is Lumsden Green. The Green occupies a triangle of land at the intersection of Parnell Road, Broadway and Khyber Pass which had been put aside as a reserve in 1878. The park is ornamented by a modernist fountain, a 19th-century cannon and a stainless steel sculpture by Marte Szirmay installed in 1969 to mark the centenary of the Newmarket Highway district. The park is named in honour of David Lumsden, the last mayor of Newmarket before amalgamation with Auckland City in 1989.

For much of the 20th century, most road traffic leaving or entering Auckland passed through Newmarket. Leading off Broadway is the beginning of Remuera Road which is the way to the eastern suburbs while further south Broadway splits into Great South Road and the secondary southern route, Manukau Road. The constant flow of traffic only added to Newmarket&#x27;s fast, modern image and helped a great deal with its prosperity. Around 1966, between 25,000-30,000 cars used the street per day.

A significant change to the skyline was the Newmarket Viaduct erected in 1966 to take one of the early sections of the Southern Motorway over the railway and half a dozen streets. The new motorway system opened up the new industrial suburbs to the south such as Penrose, Mount Wellington etc. This resulted in much of the local industry moving out of Newmarket and along with it many of the working-class people who lived in modest houses in the surrounding streets.

Since the 1960s Newmarket has been largely a retail destination, although a certain amount of light industry still existed in the surrounding streets, the most significant of which is the brewing trade. Ever since the 1840s Newmarket has been the location of several breweries. Water falling on nearby Mount Eden emerges in several reliable springs in the Khyber Pass area. Flowing through large amounts of volcanic scoria it is very well filtered. The brewery buildings on Khyber Pass Road have recently (2014) been demolished, the land has been redeveloped as part of the University of Auckland.

In 1994, Burger King opened its first store in NZ on 80A Broadway (closed down in 2020).

===Modern days===

Newmarket has become one of New Zealand&#x27;s most significant retail and hospitality destinations, and also a major entertainment hub. At the same time, the location on one of the major thoroughfares into and out of the city also led to increasing bottleneck issues, with some claiming during the middle of the 2000s that council was neglecting the area (though projects like the Central Connector have helped to alleviate this). Traffic gridlock was one of the reasons why a plan for a major new Westfield Group shopping centre near the railway line was hotly contested by the Newmarket Protection Society, a group composed mostly of residents and some local business owners. Partly due to these objections, Westfield abandoned the plans and instead bought the Two Double Seven shopping centre, now the Westfield Centre, which underwent major redevelopment and expansion during 2017-2020.

Traffic remains a major factor in the area, as Broadway carries over 40,000 vehicles a day, limiting the ability of pedestrians in the shopping district to cross the main road. An ambitious earlier plan from 2003 to construct a &quot;road over rail&quot; above the railway line, from the northwest end of Newmarket near Park Road, to the southeast near the St Marks Road interchange, did not go ahead, even though this could have significantly reduced vehicle traffic on Broadway. A late 2000s upgrade has however provided new high-quality bluestone footpaths along Broadway and some of the side-streets.

The Auckland Regional Council has designated Newmarket as a &#x27;strategic managed growth area&#x27; in the Regional Growth Strategy, meaning that high-density mixed use (residential and commercial) buildings are encouraged. This is to encourage areas in which work, living and entertainment can be achieved close to each other, limiting the average amount of [especially car-] traffic required every day. Good public transport connections are also considered to assist these policy goals. Partly due to the increasing attractiveness of living in the city, large apartment buildings are now increasingly springing up in the area, a process partly encouraged by council via new planning rules. However, many of the apartment buildings that were created in the suburb in the 2000s have been heavily criticised, and termed clusters of &quot;shoe boxes&quot; or &quot;rabbit hutches&quot;, for their small unit sizes and bland exterior.

In 2007, the Lion Brewery declared its intention to leave Newmarket in the mid-term and sold its 5ha site north of Khyber Pass Road for NZ$162 million. The area is likely to become a mixed-use development within the next half decade, marking &quot;the end of Newmarket&#x27;s industrial age&quot;, especially after Hayes Metal Refineries Ltd, the other previously remaining industry, had also decided to move in 2008, after the owners had resisted development offers to be bought out in the 1980s.

In 2012 an initiative between Newmarket Business Association and the arts resulted in the creation of the town&#x27;s first fully professional theatre company, Newmarket Stage Company. 

Newmarket shopping area&#x27;s wireless CCTV system, a system cooperatively operated by the police and the Newmarket Business Association, has been described as &quot;never having been done on this scale in a New Zealand town centre&quot;, and was credited partly for significant falls of some sorts of crime in Newmarket in recent (2009) years.

==Demographics==
Newmarket covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Newmarket had a population of 2,613 in the 2023 New Zealand census, a decrease of 18 people (−0.7%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 207 people (8.6%) since the 2013 census.

==Governance==
Newmarket had a local government just like other suburbs of Auckland at that time. The Borough of Newmarket was constituted on 7 May 1885. Before this date the affairs of the district were administered by the Newmarket Highway District (established 26 December 1868) and the Newmarket Road Board (established 19 March 1883). Newmarket Borough Council was merged into Auckland City Council in 1989 as part of the local government reforms, then eventually merged into Auckland Council in 2010. During the time when Newmarket was governing itself, it had its own mayor.

==Railway history==

Newmarket was once a centre of railway activity, with significant growth occurring after the rail line from the city was opened in 1873. Eventually, there was a junction station, two signal boxes, two railway workshop complexes, railway houses, a railway social hall and extensive goods yard. This changed in 1930 when the Newmarket Workshops closed and its functions were taken over by the Otahuhu Workshops. The workshops bordering Broadway on the other side of the Remuera Road overbridge were torn down. The workshops along Middleton Road were retained and transferred to the New Zealand Post Office for use as Post Office workshops and these structures remained in place until they were unceremoniously torn down in the mid-1990s.

On 22 February 1955 the Railway Lodge No 196 of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes was established in the Newmarket Railway Social Hall with a strong presence of over 100 brothers of the order, many of whom had connection with the railways. The Lodge continued to thrive for many years because of its link with the railways. The Railway Lodge 196 is a lodge of the New Zealand constitution of the Grand Lodge of England and continues to function, albeit in Ponsonby, not Newmarket.

In the 1980s the Newmarket Railway Social Hall and many other railway buildings were demolished. By 1995 all that was left of Newmarket&#x27;s railway heritage was the Fine Station, closed in 1983 and its signal box still staffed, and one of the last in New Zealand to utilise the old style lever frame. The old workshop buildings on Middleton Road were demolished in that year. By the 21st century little remained of Newmarket&#x27;s railway heritage other than the station, the signal box, a few items of preserved rolling stock and the Railway Lodge No 196.

Construction proceeded in 2008 on a new railway station and plaza on the northern side of Remuera Road overbridge, as a part of the Auckland Regional Transport Authority&#x27;s upgrade of rail stations across the city. Designed by Opus International Consultants, the station features two concourses, multiple escalators, and open access to Broadway via a wide plaza. A footbridge allows access to the station for pedestrians from Remuera Road. The station opened on 14 January 2010 and is the second busiest in Auckland after Britomart.

<text>Matthew Reginald Sheffield Cassan (18 February 1901 – 8 December 1957) was an English-American actor.

==Life==
He was born as Matthew Reginald Sheffield Cassan on 18 February 1901 in the St. George&#x27;s, Hanover Square district of London, to Matthew Sheffield Cassan and Alice Mary Field. He had a brother, Edward Sheffield Cassan and a sister, Flora Kathleen Sheffield Cassan, who became an actress known as Flora Sheffield.

His father was born in Ireland and his mother in England. They were married in London in 1892. Matthew died when Reginald was nine. In 1913 Reginald Sheffield (billed as Eric Desmond) appeared in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. In 1914, Alice Sheffield and her children emigrated to the United States where they lived in Queens, New York. Reginald acted on the stage and in films. While his sister, Flora, was an actress, brother Edward worked as an accountant in a bank and later became a theatrical agent.

Sheffield&#x27;s Broadway performances credited as Reggie Sheffield include &quot;Evidence&quot; (1914), in which his mother, Alice Sheffield, also appeared, &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1916), &quot;If&quot; (1917), &quot;The Betrothal&quot; (1918) and &quot;Helena&#x27;s Boys&quot; (1924). His performances credited as Reginald Sheffield include &quot;Youth&quot; (1920), &quot;The Way Things Happen&quot; (1924), &quot;Hay Fever&quot; (1925), playing Sandy Tyrell, &quot;Slaves All&quot; (1926), &quot;Soldiers and Women&quot; (1929), playing Lieutenant Mason and &quot;Dear Old England&quot; (1930).

Reginald Sheffield was married in 1927 to Louise Van Loon (21 January 1905 – 14 April 1987), a New York-born, Vassar College graduate with a liberal arts education. The couple had three children:
* Mary Alice Sheffield Cassan (born 1928)
* Jon Matthew Sheffield Cassan (11 April 1931 – 15 October 2010) (aka actor Johnny Sheffield) 
* William Hart Sheffield Cassan (15 July 1935 – 12 December 2010) (actor Billy Sheffield)

As film production became more and more located in Southern California, Sheffield and his wife travelled back and forth between New York City and Los Angeles. After several years they moved permanently to the West Coast.

Being a trained stage actor, Sheffield easily made the transition from silent films to talkies. He was a working actor who became memorable in numerous character and supporting roles and appeared with some of the greatest film stars of the day, including Constance Bennett, William Powell, George Arliss, Loretta Young, Gary Cooper, Errol Flynn, Rosalind Russell, Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine.

In 1954, he began appearing as Professor Mayberry in the television series &quot;Rocky Jones, Space Ranger&quot;. And after his son, Johnny Sheffield, appeared in his last &quot;Bomba, the Jungle Boy&quot; film in 1955, Reginald created, produced and directed a pilot for a television series, &quot;Bantu, the Zebra Boy&quot;, but a sponsor was not found and the show was never produced as a weekly series.

Sheffield acted in both versions of Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; in (1938) and (1958), the latter being his last screen appearance.

==Death==
Sheffield died 8 December 1957 at his home in Pacific Palisades, California, aged 56.

<text>Bank of Ceylon (BOC; Sinhala: ලංකා බැංකුව &quot;Lanka Bænkuwa&quot;, Tamil: இலங்கை வங்கி &quot;Ilangai Vangi&quot;) is a state-owned, major commercial bank in Sri Lanka. Its head office is located in an iconic cylindrical building in Colombo.

The bank has a network of 651 branches, 715 automated teller machines (ATMs), 159 CDM, 582 CRM network, and 15 regional loan centres within the country. It also has an around-the-clock call centre and an around the clock branch at its Colombo office.

In addition to the local presence, the bank maintains an off-shore banking unit in the head office in Colombo, three branches in Malé, Chennai, and Seychelles, and a subsidiary in London.

== History ==

Bank of Ceylon (BOC) was founded in 1939, with Sir Ernest de Silva as its first chairman. At the time, Ceylon was a British colony and the then governor Sir Andrew Caldecott ceremoniously opened the bank on 1 August. The British government introduced the banking arm for its government-oriented businesses. Two years later, in 1941, BoC started to expand beyond the city of Colombo. It opened its first branch in Kandy. Subsequently, BOC added branches in major cities such as Galle, Jaffna, Kurunegala, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Badulla, and Panadura.

* 1948: Ceylon obtained her independence from the British; the monetary authorities were transferred to Sri Lanka. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka was established in 1949 and it assumed responsibility for monetary policy and bank regulation. 
* 1949: BoC opened its first overseas branch in London, United Kingdom. The branch helped the bank and the government handle their international business.
* 1953: Chelliah Loganathan was the first Sri Lankan appointed as General Manager and Chief Executive Officer. He resigned in 1969.
* 1961: T. B. Ilangaratne, Minister of Commerce, Trade, Food and Shipping oversaw the nationalisation of the bank. 
* 1972: The then government declared the name of the country to be Sri Lanka. However, the bank did not rename itself accordingly. The government also passed the Agricultural Productivity Law, which forced the bank to open Agrarian Service Centre branches in almost all villages in the country. As a result, the branch network of the bank expanded tremendously to the majority of Sri Lanka&#x27;s rural areas.
* 1979: the then government relaxed the exchange control regulations. This liberalization of exchange control regulations led the bank to open its first Foreign Currency Unit to handle the booming demand for non-local currency business.
* 1981: BOC passed another big milestone by opening the second overseas branch, this one in Malé, Maldives.
* 1982: BOC founded the first merchant bank in Sri Lanka, which was named the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka.
* 1987: The bank moved into its 32-storey headquarters. Sri Lankans have nicknamed the building (&quot;Pittu bambuwa&quot; &quot;පිට්ටු බම්බුව&quot;) a Sinhalese term used for a cylindrical cooking implement. The new building enabled the bank to house all its administrative offices and central operations in one location.
* 1989: The bank joined with the Visa International to introduce the first credit cards business to Sri Lanka.
* 1994: BOC joined SWIFT at the SWIFT BIC BCEYLKLX along with 15 other financial institutions in Sri Lanka.
* 1995: BOC expanded its foreign operations by opening its third foreign branch in Karachi, Pakistan and fourth in Chennai, India. This facilitated the bank&#x27;s operations in the Asian Clearing Union.
* 2003: BOC took a 15% stake in newly formed Dawood Bank in Pakistan, which was later renamed as Burj Bank. BOC then transferred all its operations in Pakistan to the new bank.
* 2010: BOC converted its branch in London to a subsidiary.
* 2014: BOC started its commercial operations in Seychelles.
* 2015: BOC signed a memorandum of understanding with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

<doc id="680516" wikidata="Q659919" url="?curid=680516" title="Edwin D. Morgan">
<text>Edwin Denison Morgan (February 8, 1811February 14, 1883) was the twenty-first governor of New York from 1859 to 1862 and served in the United States Senate from 1863 to 1869. He was the first and longest-serving chairman of the Republican National Committee. He was also a Union Army general during the American Civil War. Morgan was known for his progressive views on education, prison reform, and women&#x27;s suffrage. He helped to found the Republican Party in New York and was a strong supporter of the Presidency of Abraham Lincoln.

In 1836 he moved to New York City, becoming a successful wholesale grocer and bond broker. He served as an assistant alderman and member of the New York State Senate. Originally a Whig, he was one of the founders of the Republican Party, and he served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1856 to 1864 and 1872 to 1876.

In 1858, Morgan was elected Governor of New York, and he served from 1859 to 1862. As governor during the American Civil War, Morgan supported the Union. Appointed a major general of volunteers in the Union Army, he commanded the military&#x27;s Department of New York while serving as governor. In 1863, he was elected to the United States Senate, where he served one term. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1869, and the unsuccessful Republican nominee for governor in 1876. Morgan had been a patron of Chester A. Arthur at the start of Arthur&#x27;s career; when Arthur became president, he nominated Morgan as United States Secretary of the Treasury. Morgan was confirmed by the Senate, but declined on the grounds of age and ill health. Morgan died in New York City in 1883, and was buried in Connecticut.

==Early life==
Morgan was born on February 8, 1811, in Washington, Massachusetts, to Jasper and Catherine (Copp) Morgan. The family moved to Windsor, Connecticut, where Morgan received his early education before attending Bacon Academy in Colchester. Edwin Morgan was a cousin of Morgan G. Bulkeley, the Governor of Connecticut from 1889 to 1893. In addition, he was a cousin of Congressmen Edwin B. Morgan and Christopher Morgan.

==Career==
He began his business career as a grocer in Hartford, Connecticut. He became a partner with his uncle and served on the city council. In 1836, he moved to New York City and became a successful wholesaler, broker and banker.

In 1843, Morgan organized E.D. Morgan &amp; Company, an import house, in partnership with George D. Morgan, his cousin, and Frederick Avery, who left the firm a year later and was replaced by John T. Terry. Solon Humphreys was taken in as a full partner in 1854 after working several years as an agent in St. Louis, Missouri. Largely through his connections, the firm became the principal agent for Missouri securities. Nearly two-thirds of the bonds issued by the State of Missouri from 1835 to 1860, plus a large share of securities of St. Louis, were sold through the house of Morgan – in all perhaps thirty million dollars worth. All the while the firm maintained its wholesale grocery trade.

===Political career===
In 1849, Morgan was elected as a member of the New York City Board of Assistant Aldermen. He made a name for himself as chairman of the Sanitary Committee during the cholera epidemic of 1848. He was also a member of the New York State Senate from 1850 to 1853, and State Commissioner of Immigration.

Morgan became highly influential in Republican politics of his time and twice served as chairman of the Republican National Committee, 1856 to 1864 and 1872 to 1876.

From 1859 until 1862, he served as Governor of New York, elected in 1858 and 1860. He was appointed major general of volunteers in September 1861 and commanded the Department of New York until he resigned on January 3, 1863, serving simultaneously as governor and head of the military department.

In February 1863, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, and served one term until 1869. In January 1869, he sought re-nomination, but was voted down by the Republican caucus of State legislators who instead nominated Ex-Governor Reuben E. Fenton. In 1876, Morgan ran again for Governor but was defeated by Democrat Lucius Robinson.

In 1881, Morgan was nominated by President Chester A. Arthur as Treasury Secretary and was confirmed by the Senate, but declined the position.

==Personal life==
In 1833, he married Eliza Matilda Waterman (b. 1810), daughter of Henry Waterman (1782–1854). Together, they had:

* Edwin Denison Morgan, M.D. (1834–1879), who married Sarah Elizabeth Archer, daughter of Thomas Archer.
* Frederick Avery Morgan (1838–1841), died young
* Gilbert Henry Morgan (1843–1843), died young
* Caroline Matilda Morgan (1846–1847), died young
* Alfred Waterman Morgan (1847–1848), died young

Known for generous contributions to charities and causes, he contributed large sums to the Union Theological Seminary.

<text>The Hawker Sea Hawk is a British single-seat jet day fighter formerly of the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), the air branch of the Royal Navy (RN), built by Hawker Aircraft and its sister company, Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft. Although its design originated from earlier Hawker piston-engined fighters, the Sea Hawk was the company&#x27;s first jet aircraft.

Following acceptance in the RN, the Sea Hawk proved to be a reliable and sturdy workhorse. A considerable number were also produced for the export market and were operated from aircraft carriers in Dutch and Indian service. The last operational Sea Hawks, operated by the Indian Navy, were retired in 1983.

==Design and development==

===Origins===
Towards the end of the Second World War, Hawker&#x27;s design team had become increasingly interested in developing a fighter aircraft that took advantage of the newly developed jet propulsion technology. Prior to this, Hawker had been committed until late 1944 to the production and further development of its piston-powered aircraft, such as the Hurricane, Tempest and Typhoon, to meet the wartime demands for these aircraft. On 1 September 1944, the first prototype of the company&#x27;s latest fighter aircraft, the Hawker Fury/Sea Fury, conducted its maiden flight; it was this aircraft that would serve as the basis for Hawker&#x27;s first jet-powered aircraft.

The design team studied the potential adaption of the aircraft, having opted to use the Rolls-Royce Griffon-powered Fury prototype as the starting point. The team started with the deletion of the piston engine, with its replacement, a single Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, being fitted in a mid-fuselage position, along with lateral air intakes and a tailpipe which emerged beneath the tailplane. The prospective modifications also included &quot;stretching&quot; the fuselage and moving the cockpit to the extreme front of the fuselage in a re-contoured nose; this design received the internal designation &quot;P.1035&quot;. Use of the Rolls-Royce Derwent engine had been studied but quickly discarded as lacking power for an aircraft of this size. In November 1944 the &quot;P.1035&quot; design was submitted for evaluation by the Air Ministry.
In December 1944 Hawker refined the proposed design substantially. The jet exhaust was moved from beneath the tail and re-designed as two short split-lateral exhausts (which gained the name &quot;trouser legs&quot;), embedded in the trailing edge of the wing root, which needed a corresponding thickening of the wing root; the air intakes were moved to the wing root leading edge, similar to the contemporary de Havilland Vampire. The shorter unusual bifurcated jet pipe reduced pressure losses in the jet pipe and had the additional advantage of freeing up space in the rear fuselage for fuel tanks, which gave the aircraft a longer range than many other early jets. The absence of wing fuel tanks also meant a thinner wing could be adopted without the penalty of reduced range; to ease manufacture, the elliptical wingform of the Fury was discarded in favour of a straight tapered wing design. The fuselage fuel tanks, being fore and aft of the engine, also provided for a stable centre of gravity during flight. The tail plane was raised to clear the jet exhausts. The Sea Hawk also featured a nose wheel undercarriage arrangement, the first for a Hawker-built aircraft. The aircraft was built to accommodate four 20mm Hispano-Suiza Mk. V cannon.

The redesign had led to a new name for the project, &quot;P.1040&quot;. The Air Ministry quickly issued its encouragement for Hawker&#x27;s development of the project but according to aviation author Francis K. Mason, the Air Ministry and the Admiralty had initially viewed the project with only academic interest. Official interest had also cooled by the expression of doubts voiced by Rolls-Royce Limited on the viability of the bifurcated jet pipes that the design used. Like the piston-powered Fury it had been derived from, Hawker remained keen to promote the &quot;P.1040&quot; to the Royal Air Force (RAF) and to the Navy. The P.1040 was intended to be an interceptor, even though a top speed of only 600 mph was forecast. Shortly following the end of the war, the RAF decided to cancel several large orders for Hawker&#x27;s piston-powered aircraft and to announce that the service would be taking no further interest in the &quot;P.1040&quot; proposals.
Hawker elected to refine the &quot;P.1040&quot; design as a private venture, albeit being prepared with a view for service with British military customers in mind. In October 1945, Sydney Camm, Hawker&#x27;s chief designer, being satisfied with the results generated from engineering mock-ups and wind tunnel testing, authorised a production order for a prototype by the company&#x27;s experimental department. In light of the diminished RAF interest in the project, allegedly due to the aircraft offering insufficient advances over the jet fighters that were already in service, such as the Gloster Meteor and de Havilland Vampire, in January 1946, a naval version of the P.1040 was offered by Hawker to the Admiralty as a fleet support fighter, as the &quot;P.1046&quot;.

The Admiralty was not enthusiastic, in part due to the development of the jet-powered Supermarine Attacker aircraft. The service was however intrigued by the long-range of the &quot;P.1040&quot; and the promise of increased power from the Nene engine. In May 1946, the Naval Staff authorised the manufacture of three prototypes and a further test specimen, one of these being the original prototype internally ordered by Hawker, in accordance with Naval Specification N.7/46. Hawker quickly found their development focus for the type being divided between the naval &quot;P.1046&quot; and the general-purpose &quot;P.1040&quot;, which was still hoped to be viable as an RAF fighter. The &quot;P.1040&quot; would lead to the eventual development of the land-based swept wing Hawker Hunter fighter. Swept wing versions &quot;(P.1052&quot; and &quot;P.1081&quot;) were built and experience gained with these were instrumental in developing the design of the Hunter.

===Prototypes===
On 2 September 1947, the P.1040 prototype, &quot;VP401&quot;, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Hawker N.7/46&quot; after the related naval specification, conducted its maiden flight from RAF Boscombe Down, piloted by Bill Humble. Three days later, &quot;VP401&quot; flew to Farnborough to continue trials. A month after the first flight, the existence of the P.1040 was revealed to the general public. Early flight trials encountered aerodynamically related teething problems, such as airframe vibrations and tail buffeting, which led to a redesign of the rear jet pipe fairings and the addition of a bullet-shaped anti-shock body on the tail. Other minor issues were addressed, including high stick forces and windscreen distortion; &quot;VP401&quot; needed long take-off runs which were attributed to the &quot;low-thrust&quot; Nene 1. The Nene 2/Mk.101 for production aircraft would have a higher take-off thrust.
On 31 August 1948, a naval prototype, &quot;VP413&quot;, equipped with folding wings, catapult spools and armament, conducted its first flight. &quot;VP413&quot; was quickly subjected to a series of deck assessment trials using a mock-up deck at Boscombe Down. In April 1949, &quot;VP413&quot; was transferred to the aircraft carrier to conduct general deck and handling trials at sea. These trials revealed the need for the wing span to be increased by 30 inches, the low-speed handling of the prototype having been found to be lacking. In November 1949, &quot;VP413&quot; returned to &quot;Illustrious&quot;, performing around 25 deck landings without issue.

On 17 October 1949, the third prototype, &quot;VP422&quot;, made its maiden flight. Being representative of the production aircraft, &quot;VP422&quot; incorporated a number of modifications as a result of experience gained from trials with the second prototype, these alterations included the fitting of a longer arrester hook when a number of &quot;bolters&quot; were experienced during the early dummy deck trials. After the longer hook was incorporated, this modification was carried though the remaining production runs. Other changes included the addition of fixtures for rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) and hard points plumbed for external drop tanks. On 22 November 1949, Hawker received an initial production contract for 151 aircraft named Sea Hawk. Throughout 1950, both &quot;VP413&quot; and &quot;VP422&quot; were used for preliminary service trials.

&quot;VP422&quot;, the third prototype, later joined a specially-prepared Vampire Mk 21 in testing the feasibility of operating without an undercarriage, using a flexible deck. Flying from Farnborough, &quot;VP413&quot; made the only flight with undercarriage raised from catapult launch to arrested landing on 12 November 1953. This flight was the final phase of the flexible deck project and was the only launch of an aircraft from the slotted tube catapult developed from the slotted tube launchers used for the V-1 flying bomb. Although the trials were successful, the project was abandoned when the introduction of more powerful engines obviated the need radically to adapt the design to the concept of combat aircraft without undercarriages.

&quot;VP401&quot;, the first prototype, had continued to serve in the flight test programme and was involved in two significant events prior to its retirement. On 1 August 1949, the Royal Navy entered &quot;VP401&quot; in the National Air Races, in which it won the Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) Challenge Cup Race, beating a Vampire 3 and de Havilland DH.108. &quot;VP401&quot; was later converted into a further prototype, the &quot;Hawker P.1072&quot;, the principal addition being in the form of an auxiliary rocket engine; configured as such, it became the first British rocket-powered aircraft. After a few flights were made in 1950, the rocket engine blew up during a test and although repaired, the airframe was scrapped soon after.

===Production===
Immediately following the receipt of the first order in November 1949, Hawker set about establishing a manufacturing line for the Sea Hawk at their Kingston facility. Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, an urgent operational demand for aircraft carriers and aircraft became apparent. The rate of production was substantially increased and more orders for the Sea Hawk were placed. The issuing of a &#x27;Super-Priority&#x27; status for the Sea Hawk by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1951, served to speed up production considerably as well as aid the supply of vital materials for its manufacture.

To cope with demand, address production shortcomings and cope with the parallel pressure that Hawker was facing for the development of another aircraft, the newer Hunter, it was decided that production would be transferred to a new assembly line run by Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft, part of the Hawker group, at Coventry. Prior to the transfer, 35 Sea Hawk F1, the initial production standard, were completed at Kingston. On 14 November 1951, the first production Sea Hawk F1, &quot;WF143&quot;, conducted its maiden flight. It possessed a 39 ft (12 m) wingspan and a tailplane of increased area. The first Coventry-built Sea Hawk F1 made its first flight prior to the end of 1953; a total of 60 would be produced.
While some of the initial batch of Sea Hawks would see operational service, many of the F1s would be used for various service trials. Amongst these, &quot;WF143&quot; would later be rebuilt as the prototype for the Sea Hawk F2, featuring power-assisted ailerons in place of their unpowered counterparts on the F1, to which flight trials had demonstrated a weakness in lateral control leading to instances of oscillation. On 24 February 1954, the first production Sea Hawk F2, &quot;WF240&quot;, conducted its maiden flight at Bitteswell. A total of 40 F2 aircraft would be produced.

Another Sea Hawk F1, &quot;WF157&quot;, was developed into a prototype for the FB 3 standard, the initial fighter bomber variant of the type and later most common of the Sea Hawk variants. To suit this role, much of the development work went into its range of external stores, although the clearance of these for service was disrupted by a lack of Royal Navy personnel. On 13 March 1954, the first production Sea Hawk FB 3, &quot;WF280&quot;, made its first flight. A more refined Sea Hawk FGA 4 variant followed, partially to remedy stores handling problems that had been experienced with the FB 3 variant; the first FB 4 aircraft, &quot;WV792&quot; conducted its first flight on 26 August 1954.

In 1950, it was acknowledged that the Nene 101 engine was transitional powerplant; upon availability of the 4 per cent more powerful Nene 103, the Admiralty quickly ordered many of its Sea Hawk FB 3 and FGA 4 to be re-engined. Another two Sea Hawk variants were developed; the first of these, the FB 5, was more or less identical to the FB 3 apart from the newer, more powerful Nene 103 engine, which greatly improving the aircraft&#x27;s low-speed handling and take-off performance. The final Sea Hawk standard, FGA 6, was a fighter ground-attack variant, the same as its &quot;FB 5&quot; predecessor, though they were new-build aircraft rather than re-engined ones. A total of just under 90 FGA 6s were completed.

==Design==

The F 1 was armed with four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk V cannons. It was powered by a 5,000 lbf (22 kN) thrust Rolls-Royce Nene 101 centrifugal flow turbojet engine. The Nene engine was viewed as underpowered; in 1950, the government had cancelled development of the Rolls-Royce Tay, an afterburner-equipped development of the Nene, leaving no more powerful engines to equip the Sea Hawk. More minor developments of the Nene engine were developed and were adopted on the aircraft, providing for some increase in power.

The F 1 had a maximum speed of 599 mph (964 km/h) at sea level and a range of 800 mi (1,287 km) on internal fuel. A more refined fighter variant was the F 2, which introduced power-boosted aileron controls as well as other modifications, including to its structure. The next variant of the Sea Hawk was developed into a fighter-bomber, the FB 3, and differed only slightly from its predecessors; its structure being strengthened to allow it to carry a wider array of equipment and weaponry on its four hard points, these included rockets, bombs, napalm, mines, reconnaissance cameras, external drop tanks and fixtures for RATOG.
Unlike its rival, the Supermarine Attacker, which had been the first jet aircraft to enter service with the FAA, the Sea Hawk had a tricycle undercarriage rather than a tail-wheel, making it easier to land on carriers, it was also Hawker&#x27;s first aircraft to incorporate a nose-wheel undercarriage. The Sea Hawk had adopted a fairly conventional design, being built with straight wings while a number of other contemporary aircraft, such as the F-86 Sabre, had adopted swept wings. The Sea Hawk was a reliable and elegant aeroplane, though its cautious design meant it would only be attractive on the export market and be in production for only a short period before being superseded by more advanced aircraft.

==Operational history==
The first production Sea Hawk was the &quot;F 1&quot;, which first flew in 1951, entered service two years later with 806 Squadron, first based at Brawdy, then transferred to . All Sea Hawks were in service by the mid-1950s and eventually over 500 were built.

During service evaluations of the Sea Hawk, Australian and Canadian naval pilots flew the aircraft leading to official suggestions that the aircraft would be chosen by the two countries. Both nations were also interested in new American-built naval aircraft; only a handful of Sea Hawks were transferred to either nation, some operating from the flight deck of the Australian &quot;Majestic&quot;-class aircraft carrier , though these did not enter full squadron service.
In 1956, shortly after the termination of the Sea Hawk production line, the Federal Republic of Germany placed an order for 68 aircraft to equip the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot;, the West German navy, considering them good value for money. The Bundesmarine had a requirement for a day fighter-bomber and one with an all-weather capability; 34 aircraft of each variant were ordered, the &quot;Mk 100&quot; limited to good weather, and the &quot;Mk 101&quot; equipped with a pod-based EKCO-built search radar for sea reconnaissance in all weathers. The German Sea Hawks served into the mid-1960s, until replaced by the F-104 Starfighter.

The Netherlands placed an order for 30 aircraft, as the &quot;Sea Hawk Mk 50&quot;, a ground-attack variant for the Royal Netherlands Navy, which was financed by NATO funding. The Mk 50 was externally similar to the Royal Navy aircraft, differing in its use of a Philips-built ultra high frequency (UHF) radio; Dutch Sea Hawks were later equipped to each carry a pair of AIM-9 Sidewinder infrared-guided air-to-air missiles. Between 1957 and 1964, the Dutch Navy operated 22 aircraft. The last export customer was India which ordered 24 new Sea Hawks and 12 refurbished ex-FAA Mk 6s in 1959, following up with 30 additional airframes reconstructed from West German stocks, among others.

===Combat record===

The Sea Hawk saw extensive service during the Suez Crisis, when joint Anglo-French forces invaded Egypt on 31 October 1956 in Operation Musketeer. Six Sea Hawk squadrons took part, two aboard the fleet carrier HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; and two each aboard the light fleet carriers and . The Sea Hawks were primarily used for ground attack. Due to aircraft such as the Hunter lacking the range or clearance to deliver munitions, the British ground attack capability during the conflict comprised the navy Sea Hawks and the Westland Wyverns of 830 Squadron, typically being escorted by de Havilland Sea Venom fighters.

Sea Hawks launched many attacks upon Egyptian shore-based targets, often against massed anti-aircraft fire, resulting in several aircraft being severely damaged. The Suez Crisis was to be the last Sea Hawk combat operation with the Royal Navy, as new strike aircraft such as the de Havilland Sea Vixen and the Supermarine Scimitar were introduced after the conflict.
In the Royal Netherlands Navy, the Sea Hawk served aboard the Dutch aircraft carrier , ex-, including the decolonization operations guarding against Indonesian threats in the area. From 1959 they were equipped with Sidewinder missiles significantly enhancing their air-to-air combat capabilities. In 1961, the Sea Hawks that served on her were moved ashore when the Dutch commitment to NATO was changed to maritime patrol using ASW aircraft; by October 1964 they had been taken out of service.

In Indian Navy service (beginning in 1960) Sea Hawks were used aboard the aircraft carrier , ex-HMS &quot;Hercules&quot; and saw service during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. In the latter war, Sea Hawks sank about a dozen vessels, comprising Pakistan Navy gunboats and cargo ships, in East Pakistan waters (now Bangladesh) without losing an aircraft. They were supported by Breguet Alizé aircraft which sank three gunboats. The Sea Hawk was withdrawn from Indian Navy service in 1983, being replaced by the far more capable BAE Sea Harrier.

===Retirement===

The Sea Hawks in Fleet Air Arm service began being removed from first line service in 1958, the year in which the Supermarine Scimitar and de Havilland Sea Vixen entered service, both of which types would eventually replace the Sea Hawk. The last front line Sea Hawk squadron, No. 806, disbanded at RNAS Brawdy on 15 December 1960, ending a very brief operational career for the Sea Hawk. Most Sea Hawks in second line service were withdrawn by the mid-1960s. The last operational Royal Navy Sea Hawks were FGA.6 flown by the Airwork Limited managed &quot;black&quot; Fleet Requirements Unit based at Bournemouth (Hurn) Airport which retired the type in 1969.

<text>Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York (shortened to UTS or Union) is a private ecumenical liberal Christian seminary in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, affiliated with Columbia University since 1928. Presently, Columbia University lists UTS among its affiliate schools, including the Columbia-degree conferring Barnard College and Teachers College. Beginning in 1928 and continuing until an indeterminate juncture, UTS &quot;[had] the status of a [Columbia] University faculty in the educational system of the University through representation&quot; on the now-defunct University Council. In 1964, UTS also established an affiliation with the neighboring Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Despite its affiliation with Columbia University, UTS has remained an independent institution with its own administration, degrees and Board of Trustees. UTS confers the following degrees: Master of Divinity (MDiv), Master of Divinity &amp; Social Work dual degree (MDSW), Master of Arts in religion (MAR), Master of Arts in Social Justice (MASJ), Master of Sacred Theology (STM), Doctor of Ministry (DMin), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).

UTS is the oldest independent seminary in the United States and has long been known as a bastion of progressive Christian scholarship, with a number of prominent thinkers among its faculty or alumni. It was founded in 1836 by members of the Presbyterian Church in the USA, but was open to students of all denominations. In 1893, UTS rescinded the right of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to veto faculty appointments, thus becoming fully independent. In the 20th century, Union became a center of liberal Christianity. It served as the birthplace of the Black theology, womanist theology, and other theological movements. It houses the Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary, one of the largest theological libraries in the Western Hemisphere.

==History==
===Early history===
Union Theological Seminary was founded in 1836. During the late 19th century it became one of the leading centers of liberal Christianity in the United States. In 1891, Charles A. Briggs, who was being installed as the chair of biblical studies, delivered an inaugural address in which he questioned the verbal inspiration of Scripture. When the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. vetoed Briggs&#x27; appointment and eventually deposed Briggs for heresy two years later, Union removed itself from denominational oversight. In 1939, the Auburn Theological Seminary moved to its campus and departed in 2014.

Among its graduates were the historian of Christianity Arthur McGiffert; biblical scholar James Moffatt; Harry Emerson Fosdick, the pastor of Riverside Church who served as professor during his tenure there; and the Socialist leader Norman Thomas.

====Union Settlement====
In 1895, members of the Union Theological Seminary Alumni Club founded Union Settlement Association, one of the oldest settlement houses in New York City. After visiting Toynbee Hall in London and inspired by the example of Hull House in Chicago, the alumni decided to create a settlement house in the area of Manhattan enclosed on the north and south by East 96th and 110th Streets and on the east and west by the East River and Central Park.

The neighborhood, known as East Harlem, was filled with new tenements but devoid of any civic services. The ethos of the settlement house movement called for its workers to &quot;settle&quot; in such neighborhoods in order to learn first-hand the problems of the residents. &quot;It seemed to us that, as early settlers, we had a chance to grow up with the community and affect its development,&quot; wrote William Adams Brown, Theology Professor, Union Theological Society (1892–1930) and President, Union Settlement Association (1915–1919).

Union Settlement still exists, providing community-based services and programs to support the immigrant and low-income residents of East Harlem. One of East Harlem&#x27;s largest social service agencies, Union Settlement reaches more than 13,000 people annually at 17 locations throughout East Harlem through a range of programs, including early childhood education, youth development, senior services, job training, the arts, adult education, nutrition, counseling, a farmers&#x27; market, community development, and neighborhood cultural events.

===20th century to present===
Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich made UTS the center of both liberal and neo-orthodox Protestantism in the inter-war period. Niebuhr joined UTS in 1929 and Tillich in 1933. Prominent public intellectual Cornel West commenced a promising academic career at UTS in 1977. As liberalism lost ground to conservatism after the 1960s (while neo-orthodoxy dissipated) and thus declined in prestige, UTS ran into financial difficulties and shrank significantly because of a reduced student base.

Eventually, the school agreed to lease some of its buildings to Columbia University and to transfer ownership of and responsibility for the Burke Library to Columbia. These agreements helped stabilize the school&#x27;s finances, which had been hobbled by increasing library costs and the need for substantial campus repairs.

On July 1, 2008, feminist theologian Serene Jones became UTS&#x27;s first female president in its 172-year history, succeeding Joseph C. Hough Jr.

On June 10, 2014, Jones announced that UTS would be joining the movement to divest from the fossil fuels industry in protest at the damage the industry is causing to the environment. UTS&#x27;s $108 million endowment will no longer include any fossil fuel investments. On May 9, 2024, UTS&#x27;s Board of Trustees voted to endorse divestment from &quot;companies profiting from the war in Palestine&quot; and announced that they will be joining the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.

Classroom and faculty space was added to UTS in the early 2020s as part of the construction of Claremont Hall, a 41-story residential condominium at 100 Claremont Avenue. UTS owns 27 of the apartments in Claremont Hall.

Although administratively independent from Columbia, UTS is affiliated through representation by one voting faculty member and one non-voting student observer in the Columbia University Senate.

==Campus==

UTS&#x27;s campus is located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, bordered by Claremont Avenue, Broadway, and West 120th and 122nd Streets. The brick and limestone English Gothic revival architecture, by architects Allen &amp; Collens, completed in 1910, includes the tower, which adapts features of the crossing tower of Durham Cathedral. Adjacent to Teachers College, Barnard College, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and the Manhattan School of Music, Union has cross-registration and library access agreements with all of these schools.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1980, and parts were made a New York City designated landmark in 1965. Some sections of the campus are now on long-term lease to Columbia University.

===Library===

The Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary, one of the largest theological libraries in North America, contains over 700,000 items. Burke&#x27;s holdings include extensive special collections, including Greek census records from 20 CE, a rare 12th-century manuscript of the Life of St. Boniface, and one of the first African-American hymnals, published in Philadelphia in 1818.

The Burke Library also maintains a number of world-renowned archival collections, including the Archives of Women in Theological Scholarship and the Missionary Research Library Archives.

In 2004, the Burke Library became fully integrated into the Columbia University Libraries system, which holds over 14 million volumes. The library is named in honor of Walter Burke, a generous benefactor to the library who served as chairman of the Board of Directors of the Seminary from 1976 to 1982.

==Faculty==
Both Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich taught at the seminary. Nieburhr joined the faculty in 1929 and retired in 1952. Tillich was recruited by Niebuhr to UTS following his dismissal from the University of Frankfurt. Nazi officials terminated Tillich from the University of Frankfurt and placed him on their list of &quot;undesirables&quot;. Tillich subsequently narrowly escaped arrest by the Gestapo in October 1933 and made his way out of Germany joining UTS in December 1933.

In 1930, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a Postgraduate Teaching Fellow at the seminary. He later returned in 1939 to be a member of the faculty and to escape Nazi harassment in Germany. Writing of his experience there in his book &quot;Barcelona, Berlin, New York&quot;, Bonhoeffer was dismayed by the liberalism of the seminary and its students, noting, &quot;The students are completely clueless with respect to what dogmatics is really about. They are not familiar with even the most basic questions. They become intoxicated with liberal and humanistic phrases, are amused at the fundamentalists, and yet basically are not even up to their level...&quot; Referring to Union Seminary, Bonhoeffer noted: &quot;A seminary in which numerous students openly laugh during a public lecture because they find it amusing when a passage on sin and forgiveness ...is cited has obviously, despite its many advantages, forgotten what Christian theology in its very essence stands for&quot; (pp. 309–10). He soon regretted his decision and decided that he had to return to Germany to resist the Nazis. He took the last ship from New York to Germany in late August 1939. Due to his secret involvement with the 20 July plot on Hitler&#x27;s life, he was executed at the Flossenbürg concentration camp on April 8, 1945, only 15 days before the United States Army liberated the camp.

American theologian, James Hal Cone, one of the founders of liberation theology and influential in the development of Black theology, began teaching at Union Theological Seminary in New York City in 1970, holding the distinguished Charles A. Briggs Chair in systematic theology from 1977 until his death in 2018.

Serene Jones, the seminary&#x27;s first female president, was inaugurated in November 2008. replacing Joseph Hough, UTS&#x27; immediate past president. Civil rights activist Cornel West joined the faculty in July 2012, and rejoined again in 2021.

<doc id="680543" wikidata="Q7402559" url="?curid=680543" title="Saitwal">
<text>Saitwal (or Swahitwal) is a Digambara Jain community of Maharashtra. Swahitwal means that they work for the benefit of their inner self (Swa+hit+wal).

Saitwal community is largely concentrated in Maharashtra state, though people from Saitwal community can be found in all over India.

Another name for Setaväla is Svahitavāla or Sahitavāla. It is said that the Svahitavālas are divided into two sub-castes, viz., (i) Svahitavāla and (ii) Setavāla, based on the difference of occupation. The latter weave bodice cloth, and are cloth merchants, shop-keepers and money-lenders. The former are tailors.These distinctions are not observed now and all are termed as Setavālas.

As regards their origin many accounts are told. According to one account the Setavālas are considered as the descendants of the Kshatriyas who came to the Deccan for the protection of the Jaina sages and places of pilgrimage from fiercer sort of people, whose leaders were called Bhairavas. The places where the sages resided and where religion was specially practised were called Kshetras or holy places. The people who had been entrusted with the sacred duty of protecting religion and religious places came to be called Kshetrapālas or protectors of holy places. The Präkrit form of the Sanskrit word Kshetrasāla is Chhettaväla from which the Marathi word Setaväla is derived. From this it appears that the Setavälas came from the North and settled in the Deccan. Mr. Russel also mentions that Saitavāla is one of the castes which came into the Central Provinces from Rajputanā. As regards Setavālas in the Bombay Province it stated that they seem to have come from Marwar in search of work, though when they came is not known. They have many rustic customs and ways, but signs remain which support their claim to have a strain of Kshatriya blood. According to another account, the Setavālas appear to have been originally a body of hundred families excommunicated for some unknown reason; and now forming a caste by themselves. They were formerly known as Satavālas or the hundred families.in This seems to be wrong for obvious reasons. According to the third, the word Setavāla is derived from a Marathi word &quot;Seta&#x27; i.e., a farm, and Setavālas are those who subsist on farming.

There are supposed to be many gotras among Setavālas but the names of 44 gotras only are available, viz., Bahu; Abhaya kumāra; Sahasrabāhu; Maghava; Vijayamitra; Mahäbahu; Bhūvallabha; Hariketu; Vijaya; Dhanapati; Simharatha; Vidyasakti; Supratishtha; Meghavähana; Prthvipäla; Vajradanta; Ratnāyudha; Anantavijaya; Dharma; Prajñāpāla; Yugandhara; Lokapāla; Hariśchandra; Sūryaputra; Yaśapäla; Minaketu; Surendra-datta; Pundarīka; Dhanaratha; Dhātrivāhana; Susheņa; Subhachandra; Pūrvabāhu; Maņimālā; Jitaśatru; Vajräyudha; Satyašruti; Jayan dhara; Narmadā; Vimalavähana; Surakirti; Vimalakirti; Srīsheņa and Chakräyudha.

The community is majority among Digambar Jains in Maharashtra. They are predominantly in profession of silver ornament making, weaving, oil extraction, tailoring and have been spread in pockets of Vidarbha, Marathwada, Khandesh and in small proportion in Western Maharashtra as well.

Mostly the financially weaker section among otherwise well to do Jains. Over past few decades many of Saitwal Jains have achieved socioeconomic development with education and entrepreneurship.

Last year this community was awarded OBC status by government though it was deprived of such privileges for many years even after remaining weaker section of society due to misconception of being an integral part of elite Jain community.

==History==
Several Jain authors were born in this community. This includes Pasakirti (Sudarshana Charitra, shaka 1549), Brahma Matisagar (Adinath panchkalyanaka, shaka 1732), Nemsagar (shaka 1675–1776) etc.

A bronze image of Chandraprabha has been discussed by J. C. Wright that has an inscription mentioning that it was installed by a person of Sehitavāla jati in Śaka Year 1559 (A.D. 1638) under the supervision of Bhattaraka Vijayakīrti.

==Religious organizations==

The Dakshin Bharat Jain Sabha is a religious and social service organization of the Jains of South India. The organization is headquartered at Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India. The association is credited with being one of the first Jain associations to start reform movements among the Jains in modern India. The organization mainly seeks to represent the interests of the native Jains of Maharashtra (Marathi Jains), Karnataka (Kannada Jains) and Goa.

<doc id="680544" wikidata="Q271167" url="?curid=680544" title="Zhongshan District, Taipei">
<text>Zhongshan District () is an administrative district of Taipei City.

== Economy==
In the 1970s, the district was recognized as the center of the city&#x27;s tourist industry, with large hotels and international restaurants. The interest from tourists allowed the district to develop as a center of international business.

In recent decades, the district&#x27;s economy and its population have both contracted, due in part to the decentralisation of industrial and manufacturing activities. Parts of Taipei&#x27;s &quot;financial core&quot; (that once centred on the Zhongshan District) have been moved to other districts.

Between 1991 and 1996, the district lost 2,600 jobs while the rest of Taipei experienced increased jobs growth (120,000 jobs in the same period). Between 1991 and 1999, the district&#x27;s population decreased by more than 21,000, accounting for 27.6% of Taipei&#x27;s total population decrease during that period. According to some economists, the decrease in population and jobs allowed an informal sex industry to thrive in the district leading to an increased crime rate.

Tatung Company, PXmart, and Uni Air have their headquarters in the district.

The Taiwanese subsidiary of American Megatrends, AMI Taiwan (), is headquartered in Zhongshan District.

== Recreation ==
The district features many recreational areas which include Rongxing Garden Park, Xinsheng Park, Yingfeng Riverside Park, Meiti Riverside Park, Zhongshan Fine Arts Park, Dajia Riverside Park and Taipei Municipal Children&#x27;s Recreation Area.

Historical buildings and museums include Lin An Tai Historical House and Museum, Miniatures Museum of Taiwan, Museum of Jade Art, Suho Memorial Paper Museum and Taipei Film House.

The &quot;National Revolutionary Martyrs&#x27; Shrine&quot; is located in the district, dedicated to those who died trying to turn China into a republic. The district also has a Fine Arts Museum and the Lin An Tai Historical House and Museum.

Another major tourist attraction is the Xingtian Temple (), which is dedicated to Guan Gong, the Martial God of Loyalty and Righteousness. Nearby the Yuanshan Metro Station is the Zhongshan Soccer Stadium, which was built on land that used to be the headquarters of the US military presence on Taiwan when the US still had diplomatic ties with the Republic of China. Not surprisingly, Zhongshan has a large pub and bar district and the Zhongshan Metro Mall.

Linji Huguo Chan Temple () was commenced in 1900 and completed in 1911; it is one of the very few Japanese-style Buddhist Temples that were well-preserved in Taiwan.

==Other places==
The northernmost part of Zhongshan District is known as . The former ROC President Chiang Ching-kuo lived here at the Seven Seas Residence. In this region, there is also the Dominican International School, which is a private English language Catholic school serving kindergarten to high school.

Taipei&#x27;s equivalent to &quot;Little Manila&quot; lies in the Zhongshan District in the region near St. Christopher&#x27;s (Catholic) Church. Every Sunday, many Filipino domestic workers and laborers attend mass at the church and relax around the surrounding Filipino grocery stores and eateries.

The Zhongshan District is also home to a number of wedding photo shops particularly along the 2nd and 3rd sections of Zhongshan North Road. Access to this district by transit is very convenient with 6 Taipei Metro stations (2 on the Wenshan Line and 4 on the Tamsui Line). Also a number of new stations are under construction as part of Phase 2 of the Taipei Metro expansion plan. Like the rest of Taipei City, Zhongshan District is serviced by an extensive public bus system that supplements the Taipei Metro. Also, numerous private bus companies operate buses into this district to other parts of Taiwan such as Taoyuan City and Kaohsiung.

==Institutions==
* Bureau of Energy
* Ministry of National Defense
* Republic of China Air Force General Headquarters
* Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
* Taipei Broadcasting Station

==Education==
* Taipei Municipal Datong High School
* Taipei Municipal Zhongshan Girls High School
* National Taipei University (Taipei Campus)
* Shih Chien University (Taipei Campus)
* Taipei Municipal Dazhi Senior High School

==Transportation==

On a historical note, Zhongshan North Road, which crosses the district, was often used by Chiang Kai-shek to get to his home in Shilin. All traffic was stopped when this occurred, as everybody had to salute the leader. Military police during martial law often lined the street, as this road was used by numerous political and military leaders, some of whom stayed at the Grand Hotel in Yuanshan.

Zhongshan Road, along with Zhongxiao Road (which runs west to east), denote the compass directions of roads in Taipei City. For instance, when Zhongshan South Rd intersects with Zhongxiao Road, it becomes Zhongshan North Road. Similarly, When Zhongxiao West Road intersects with Zhongshan Road, it becomes Zhongxiao East Road. This methodology can be applied for most roads in Taipei City.

Zhongshan District is served by the following stations of the Taipei Metro:
*Zhongshan Junior High School metro station
*Dazhi metro station
*Jiannan Road metro station
*Shuanglian metro station
*Yuanshan metro station
*Xingtian Temple metro station
*Zhongshan Elementary School metro station
*Zhongshan metro station
*Minquan West Road metro station
*Songjiang Nanjing metro station
*Nanjing Fuxing metro station

<doc id="680546" wikidata="Q3111944" url="?curid=680546" title="Non-League football">
<text>Non-League football describes football leagues played outside the top leagues of a country. Usually, it describes leagues which are not fully professional. The term is primarily used for football in England, where it is specifically used to describe all football played at levels below those of the Premier League (20 clubs) and the three divisions of the English Football League (EFL; 72 clubs). Currently, a non-League team would be any club playing in the National League or below that level. Typically, non-League clubs are either semi-professional or amateur in status, although the majority of clubs in the National League division (level 5) are fully professional, some of which are former EFL clubs who have suffered relegation. 

The term &quot;non-League&quot; was commonly used in England long before the creation of the Premier League in 1992, prior to which the top football clubs in England all belonged to The Football League (from 2016, the EFL); at this time, the Football League was commonly referred to as simply &quot;the League&quot; and its clubs were &quot;League clubs&quot;, so all clubs which were not members of the Football League were therefore &#x27;non-League&#x27; clubs. Since 1992, the term &quot;non-League&quot; has come to mean clubs at a lower level than the Football League, as the original definition of being outside the Football League would include Premier League clubs.

==Non-League football in England==

===English Football League===

The &quot;League&quot; (with a capital &#x27;L&#x27;) in &quot;non-League football&quot; originally referred specifically to The Football League (now the English Football League, which the Premier League split from in 1992), rather than being a misnomer, as &quot;non-League&quot; clubs do play the majority of their football within a league (with a lower-case &#x27;l&#x27;) competition. There are many leagues below the level of the EFL, and some, such as the Northern League, are almost as old as the EFL itself. The most senior of these leagues are loosely organised by The Football Association, the sport&#x27;s governing body in England, into a National League System (NLS). The NLS has six levels or &quot;steps&quot; and includes over 18 separate leagues, many with more than one division.

Prior to the 1986–87 season, there was no automatic promotion and relegation between The Football League and the leagues of non-League football for nearly a hundred years. Instead, the process of re-election existed; at the end of each season, the bottom clubs of the EFL were required to re-apply for membership, whilst ambitious non-League clubs put themselves up as candidates for admittance against them. All member clubs of the Football League then voted for their choice. In most cases, this was a mere formality; member clubs would typically vote for other existing members and the system ensured that Football League membership remained relatively static, with non-League clubs having very little chance of joining. Since the process began, thirteen non-League clubs had achieved enough votes to win election as a member of the Football League.

However, a major change came in 1986 when automatic promotion and relegation of one club between the League and the Football Conference, the top league in non-League football, was introduced, subject to the eligible club meeting the required facility and financial standards. Scarborough became the first non-League club to win automatic promotion to the League, and Lincoln City became the first League club to be relegated to the ranks of non-League football. Since the 2002–03 season, two clubs from the Conference, now National League (the champions and the winners of a play-off) have been promoted at the end of each season.

The entire English football league system includes the Premier League, the EFL, the NLS leagues, and any local leagues that have feeder relationships with an NLS league.

Many non-League clubs enter the FA Cup, where they hope to become &quot;giant-killers&quot; by progressing from the qualifying rounds, and first and second rounds proper, to meet and beat opposition from the Premier League or EFL Championship. Since the end of the Second World War, only eleven non-League clubs have reached the Fifth Round of the FA Cup, and only one (Lincoln City in 2016–17 season) has reached the quarter-final stage. The only non-League team to have won the competition since The Football League started is Tottenham Hotspur in 1901, although at that time the League had only two divisions, consisting almost entirely of Northern and Midland clubs. The leading clubs in the South played in the Southern Football League, which was of a comparable standard to the League clubs. From its inaugural match in 1908 until 1912, the FA Charity Shield was contested between the champions of the League and the Southern Football League.

===The FA Trophy and FA Vase===

The Football Association Challenge Trophy was introduced in 1969 to offer semi-professional non-League clubs a realistic chance of winning an FA competition. Amateur clubs could enter the FA Amateur Cup until 1974 when the Football Association abolished the distinction between professionals and amateurs. The Amateur Cup was replaced by the FA Vase in 1974 which is currently contested by clubs at Step 5 and 6 of the NLS and below while the Trophy is contested by clubs at Steps 1–4.

===League system===
===Women&#x27;s football===

In women&#x27;s football, the &quot;non-League&quot; term is used for those clubs in the divisions below the FA Women&#x27;s Championship. Formerly it referred to the clubs in the FA Women&#x27;s Premier League&#x27;s two regional second divisions.

==Non-League football in other countries==
===Germany===
In Germany, there is a similar term, &quot;unterklassig&quot; (literally &quot;under-class&quot;), which usually refers to regional leagues below the three national leagues 1. Bundesliga, 2. Bundesliga and 3. Liga. The highest level of regional leagues, called Regionalliga, may or may not be included in the term.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, football outside the top two divisions consists of regional senior leagues based on which province the club comes from; although again these leagues are commonly referred to as &#x27;non-League&#x27;.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, &quot;non-League football&quot; refers to leagues outside the top four divisions of the national Scottish Professional Football League. These consist of a number of regional senior leagues which are part of the Scottish football pyramid system.

===Spain===
Football below the professional level in Spain is commonly referred to as &quot;fútbol modesto&quot; (literally &quot;modest football&quot;).

<doc id="680555" wikidata="Q546282" url="?curid=680555" title="Xia (Sixteen Kingdoms)">
<text>Xia (), known in historiography as Hu Xia (胡夏), Northern Xia (北夏), Helian Xia (赫連夏) or the Great Xia (大夏), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Helian clan of Xiongnu ethnicity during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. Prior to establishing the Xia, the imperial clan existed as a tribal entity known as the Tiefu ().

All rulers of the Xia declared themselves &quot;emperors&quot;. Both the Tiefu and Xia were based in the Ordos Desert, and during the reign of Helian Bobo, they constructed their capital of Tongwan, a heavily fortified and state-of-the-art city that served as a frontier garrison until the Song dynasty. Its ruins were discovered during the Qing dynasty and can still be seen in present-day Inner Mongolia. At its peak, the Xia also controlled the Guanzhong region in modern-day central Shaanxi. Due to their mix Xiongnu and Xianbei ethnicity, the Tiefu were initially known as a group of Wuhuan, which in the 4th century, was another term for &quot;miscellanous &quot;hu&quot; or &quot;zahu&quot;&quot; (雜胡). It was not until Helian Bobo came to power that they fully affirm their Xiongnu lineage in a bid for legitimacy by claiming descent from the ancient Xia dynasty.

== History ==

=== Tiefu tribe ===
The rulers of Xia came from the Tiefu tribe, who descended from the Southern Xiongnu leader, Qubei. Qubei was a member of the ruling-Luandi clan as the brother of the chanyu, Qiangqu, although a later and more dubious account alleged that he was the descendant of a Han dynasty prince-turned-Xiongnu noble, Liu Jinbo (劉進伯) instead. In 196, he assisted the warlord, Cao Cao in escorting Emperor Xian of Han to Xuchang, and in 216, Cao Cao appointed him to supervise the Five Divisions of the Southern Xiongnu in Shanxi. As the Xiongnu imperial family claimed descent from the Han dynasty through their &quot;heqin&quot; marriages with Han princesses, Qubei&#x27;s family adopted the &quot;Liu&quot; (劉) surname.

In 309, Qubei&#x27;s grandson, Liu Hu succeeded his father, Liu Gaoshengyuan, as chieftain and named his tribe “Tiefu”. The word &quot;Tiefu&quot; referred to people with Xiongnu fathers and Xianbei mothers, indicating that the tribe had intermingled with the Xianbei. The Tiefu were also known as Wuhuan, which in the 4th century was another term for &quot;miscellaneous &quot;hu&quot; or &quot;zahu&quot;&quot;. 

In 310, Liu Hu rebelled against the Western Jin dynasty in Shanxi. The Tuoba-Xianbei tribe allied with Jin and quelled his rebellion, and were rewarded with their fiefdom of Dai. Liu Hu fled west to Shuofang Commandery, where the Han-Zhao emperor, Liu Cong, gave him the title of Duke of Loufan.

The Tiefu resided in Shuofang for many years. Liu Hu waged war with Dai but was repeatedly defeated and at one point had to flee the Great Wall. His son, Liu Wuhuan succeeded him in 341 and immediately entered a marriage alliance with Dai. On the other hand, he also submitted to the Jie-led Later Zhao dynasty. His brother Liu Eloutou succeeded him in 356, but was ousted by Wuhuan&#x27;s son, Liu Xiwuqi in 358. After Xiwuqi died in 359, his brother, Liu Weichen, killed his son and took power.

Weichen vacillated his allegiance between Dai and the Di-led Former Qin. In 376, after multiple defeats to Dai, he convinced Qin to launch a campaign against them, with him acting as a guide. Qin conquered Dai that same year, but when dividing up their territory, Weichen was unhappy that Qin deferred more control over to his cousin, Liu Kuren of the Dugu tribe, prompting him to rebel. He was defeated and forced to cross the Yellow River west of the Ordos, where he resubmitted to Qin.

As Former Qin collapsed following the Battle of Fei River, Weichen re-occupied Shuofang in 386. Around the same time, the Tuoba had also revived their state, now known as the Northern Wei. The Tiefu initially posed a threat to Wei, but in 392, Weichen was killed and the tribe’s power base was destroyed after a Wei counteroffensive. A son of Weichen, Liu Bobo, went into exile and found protection under the Xianbei chieftain, Moyigan (沒弈干) at Gaoping (高平; in present-day Guyuan, Ningxia).

In 402, Moyigan and Liu Bobo fled to the Qiang-led Later Qin under pressure from Wei. During his time in Qin, Bobo caught the attention of its ruler, Yao Xing. Impressed by his appearance and talents, Yao Xing made Bobo a general and assigned him to defend Shuofang, despite warnings from his officials regarding his violent behaviour. In 407, Bobo was angered by peace talks between Qin and Wei, leading him to rebel. After ceasing 8,000 tribute horses from the Rouran, he went to Gaoping and killed Moyigan, taking over his forces.

=== Reign of Helian Bobo ===

As the Xiongnu alleged that they descended from Yu the Great, Liu Bobo claimed descent from the Xia dynasty and founded his state of Great Xia, claiming the titles of Heavenly King and Grand Chanyu. The same year, he led his forces to subjugate the tribes in Shuofang. He briefly fought with the Southern Liang after they rejected a marriage alliance, dealing them a heavy defeat. Despite his grudge against Northern Wei, Bobo mainly concentrated his military efforts on the Later Qin. He refused to establish a capital in his early reign, instead choosing to lead a roving army and attacking Qin’s northern borders when least expected.

In 413, Bobo, believing that it was inappropriate to claim lineage of the Han dynasty through his maternal line, changed his family name from Liu to the prestigious-sounding name of Helian. He also built his capital city of Tongwancheng at the southern edge of the Mu Us Desert. Construction of the city was reportedly brutal, with around 100,000 Han Chinese and tribal people being drafted to build the city. Remains of the city can still be seen today at Jingbian County, Shaanxi. In 414, Helian Bobo entered into an alliance with the Northern Yan in Liaoning, and in 415, with the Northern Liang in Gansu.

The war with Xia greatly drained the Qin economy and military, with many of their key generals being killed in battle. In 417, the Eastern Jin commander, Liu Yu, conquered Qin, but the situation back at the Jin capital forced him to return and leave behind his generals to defend the Guanzhong region. In 418, Bobo invaded the Guanzhong, and due to violent infighting among the Jin generals, he inflicted them a catastrophic defeat and captured the region.

In 419, Helian Bobo elevated himself to Emperor of Xia. Although the ancient capital, Chang’an, was under his control, he merely set up a Southern Administration there and remained with Tongwancheng as his capital out of concern that the Northern Wei would invade the Ordos in his absence. Throughout his reign, Bobo is described in records as an extremely cruel ruler who often killed his subjects on impulse. In 424, a civil war broke out among his sons, which ended in him appointing Helian Chang as his new Crown Prince.

=== Decline and fall ===
After Helian Bobo’s death in 425, the Northern Wei intensified their pressure on the Xia. While Helian Chang was away campaigning against the Western Qin, Wei carried out a surprise attack on Xia, capturing many cities in Guanzhong including Chang’an. In 427, as Xia attempted to recapture Chang’an, Wei launched a second attack and captured their capital at the Battle of Tongwancheng. Chang relocated to Shanggui, but after several more defeats, he was finally captured in battle in 428.

Helian Chang’s brother, Helian Ding, declared himself the new emperor at Pingliang. In 431, as Wei continued their encroachment, he made a last-ditch effort to expand westwards. He conquered the weakened Western Qin, but on his way to invade Northern Liang, he was ambushed and captured by the Tuyuhun. Helian Ding’s capture marked the end of the Xia, and in 432, he was turned over to Wei and executed. In 434, Helian Chang tried to escape west from Pingcheng but was intercepted and killed.

== Relations with the Dugu ==
Liu Hu&#x27;s uncle was Liu Meng, who in 272 was killed by the Jin dynasty after he rebelled the previous year. While Hu&#x27;s father Liu Gaoshengyuan took over their people, Meng&#x27;s son, Liu Fulun (劉副崙) fled to the Tuoba tribe. In 318, Fulun&#x27;s son, Liu Lugu (劉路孤) also surrendered to the Tuoba and was given a daughter by Tuoba Yulü to marry. Fulun&#x27;s branch became known as the Dugu tribe (獨孤), and like the Tiefu, they were known as Wuhuan people due to their mixed ethnicity.

Yao Weiyuan (姚薇元) suggested in the past that &#x27;Dugu&#x27; was an alternate form of &#x27;Tuge&#x27; (屠各), the Xiongnu aristocratic clan that had adopted the Han Chinese surname of Liu (劉), members of which also ruled the Former Zhao state. This writer further suggests that &#x27;Tuge&#x27; is an alternate form of &#x27;Tuhe&#x27; (徒河), which is the branch of the Xianbei from which the Murong (慕容) were descended.

<text>Edwin Denby (February 18, 1870 – February 8, 1929) was an American lawyer and politician who served as Secretary of the Navy in the administrations of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge from 1921 to 1924. He also played a notable role in the infamous Teapot Dome scandal which took place during the Harding presidency. He was the son of Charles Harvey Denby, grandson of Graham N. Fitch, brother of Charles Denby, Jr., and uncle of dance critic Edwin Orr Denby.

==Early life and education==
Denby was born in Evansville, Indiana, where he attended the public schools. In 1885, his father, Charles Harvey Denby, was appointed United States minister at Peking, China, by President Grover Cleveland, and Edwin accompanied him. He worked in the maritime customs service from 1887 to 1894. He then returned to the United States and graduated from law school at the University of Michigan in 1896. While attending the University of Michigan, Denby played on the 1895 Michigan Wolverines football team. He was subsequently admitted to the bar and began practicing as a lawyer in Detroit.

In 1898 Denby enlisted in the United States Navy and served aboard the auxiliary cruiser USS &quot;Yosemite&quot; in the Caribbean. He was discharged with the rating of Gunner&#x27;s Mate 3rd Class.

==Political and military career==
He was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives in 1903. In 1904, Denby was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 1st congressional district to the 59th, 60th and 61st Congresses, serving from March 4, 1905, to March 3, 1911. Denby served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Naval Affairs.
He was defeated in 1910 general election by Democrat Frank E. Doremus and resumed his law practice in Detroit. He served as president of the Detroit Board of Commerce in 1916, and in 1917 enlisted as a private in the United States Marine Corps when the U.S. entered World War I. He was discharged in 1919 with the rank of major.

When Warren G. Harding became President in March 1921, he appointed Denby Secretary of the Navy. During the crisis of mail robberies in 1921, Denby issued orders that Marines should be put in mail trucks and rail cars as protectors of the U.S. Mails. In his stirring order &quot;To the Men of the Mail Guard&quot;, Denby impressed upon his former service the importance of the high duty entrusted to them: &quot;If two Marines are covered by a robber, neither must put up his hands, but both must immediately go for their guns. One may die, but the other will get the robber, and the mail will get through. &quot;When our Corps goes in as guards over the mail, that mail must be delivered, or there must be a Marine dead at the post of duty. There can be no compromise ...&quot;&quot; Within days, the robberies stopped, and there was not a single delivery of the mails disrupted while Marines stood the watch.

===Teapot Dome scandal===

Shortly afterwards, Denby got Harding&#x27;s approval to transfer control of the naval oil reserves at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk Hills, California, from the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Interior, headed by Albert B. Fall. Fall proceeded to lease these oil fields to friends who were heads of oil companies in exchange for over $400,000 in personal loans. Despite attempts to keep the deal secret, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; leaked news of the leasing, and the Senate decided to launch an inquiry into the matter.

The investigation began in October 1923 after Harding&#x27;s death, and the Senate Committee on Lands and Public Surveys, which carried out the inquiry, concluded in 1924 that the Teapot Dome and Elk Hills leases to the oil companies had been fraudulent and corrupt. Both Denby and Fall were forced to resign from office as a result; however, it is apparent that President Harding did not have an active role in the wrongdoing.

==Death==
Following his resignation, Denby went back to practicing law in Detroit, where he died at age 58. Detroit&#x27;s Edwin C. Denby High School is named in his honor, as is the Denby Center for Children and Family Services, which the Salvation Army opened in Detroit in 1930 to provide housing and treatment for abused and neglected children.

<doc id="680559" wikidata="Q836256" url="?curid=680559" title="Ran Min">
<text>Ran Min (; died 352), also known as Shi Min (石閔), posthumously honored by the Former Yan as [[Tian Wang|Heavenly King]] Wudao of (Ran) Wei ((冉)魏武悼天王), courtesy name Yongzeng (永曾), nickname Jinu (棘奴), was a military leader during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms in China and the only emperor of the short-lived state [[Ran Wei]] (冉魏). He was known for ordering the culling of the Jie and other barbarians, during which 200,000 people, both Han and non-Han people, were killed between 349 and 350.

== Family background ==
Ran Min&#x27;s father Ran Liang (冉良), who later changed his name to Ran Zhan (冉瞻), was from Wei Commandery (魏郡, roughly modern Anyang, Northern Henan) and was a descendant of an aristocratic family, but one who must have, in the serious famines 310, joined a group of refugees known as the Qihuo led by Chen Wu (陳午). When Later Zhao&#x27;s founder Shi Le defeated Chen in 311, he captured the 11-year-old Ran Zhan as well, and for reasons unknown, he had his nephew Shi Hu adopt Ran Zhan as his son and change his name accordingly to Shi Zhan. Ran Min&#x27;s mother was named Wang (王). It is not known when he was born, but he would have been known as Shi Min.

A Shi Zhan was mentioned to have died in battle when Shi Hu was defeated by Han-Zhao&#x27;s emperor Liu Yao in 328, but it is not clear whether this Shi Zhan was Shi Min&#x27;s father.

== During Shi Hu&#x27;s reign ==
In the Book of Jin, Shi Min was described as over 1.9 meters tall and possessed unusual physical strength. As Shi Min grew in age, Shi Hu became impressed by his bravery in battle and battlefield tactics, and he treated Shi Min as his own son. The first mention in history of him as a general was in 338, when Shi Hu unsuccessfully tried to destroy the rival state Former Yan but saw his army collapse after sieging the Former Yan capital Jicheng (棘城, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning) for about 20 days but failing to capture it. The only army group that remained intact was the one commanded by Shi Min.

During the remainder of Shi Hu&#x27;s reign, Shi Min was often referred to as a general he turned out to be. For example, in 339, when the Jin general Yu Liang considered launching a major campaign against Later Zhao, Shi Hu chose to react, and he had his general Kui An command five generals, one of whom was Shi Min, to attack Jin&#x27;s northern regions. (Shi Min&#x27;s later ally Li Nong was one of the other generals, while Shi Hu&#x27;s son Shi Jian the Prince of Yiyang was another.) Shi Min was successful in his task, and the five generals together inflicted heavy damages, thwarting Yu&#x27;s plans. For his accomplishments, Shi Min was created the Duke of Wuxing.

== During the confusion after Shi Hu&#x27;s death ==
After Shi Hu&#x27;s death in 349, his youngest son and crown prince Shi Shi became emperor, but the government was controlled by Shi Shi&#x27;s mother Empress Dowager Liu and the official Zhang Chai. Shi Shi&#x27;s older brother Shi Zun, the Prince of Pengcheng, was unhappy about the situation, and a number of generals who were unimpressed with Empress Dowager Liu and Zhang, including Shi Min, suggested that he march to the capital Yecheng and overthrow them. Shi Zun did so – and also promised to create Shi Min crown prince if they were victorious. In summer 349, Shi Zun defeated Shi Shi&#x27;s forces and deposed and killed him, along with Empress Dowager Liu and Zhang Chai. Shi Zun claimed the imperial title. However, he did not appoint Shi Min crown prince as promised, but rather appointed another nephew Shi Yan (石衍) crown prince. Further, while he gave Shi Min important posts, he did not allow him to have control of the government, as Shi Min wished. Shi Min became disgruntled.

In winter 349, in fear of Shi Min, Shi Zun summoned a meeting of the princes before his mother, Empress Dowager Zheng, announcing that he would execute Shi Min. Empress Dowager Zheng opposed, reasoning that Shi Min&#x27;s contributions during the coup against Shi Shi had to be remembered. Shi Zun hesitated, and meanwhile, Shi Jian, one of the princes attending the meeting, quickly reported the news to Shi Min, who acted quickly and surrounded the palace, capturing and executing Shi Zun, Empress Dowager Zheng, Shi Zun&#x27;s wife Empress Zhang, Shi Yan, and several key officials loyal to Shi Zun. He made Shi Jian emperor, but he and Li Nong seized the control of the government.

Shi Jian could not endure Shi Min&#x27;s hold on power, and he sent his brother Shi Bao, the Prince of Leping, and the generals Li Song (李松) and Zhang Cai (張才) against Shi Min, but after they were defeated Shi Jian pretended as if they had acted independently and executed them all. Another brother of his, Shi Zhi the Prince of Xinxing, then rose in the old capital Xiangguo (襄國, in modern Xintai, Hebei), in alliance with the Qiang chieftain Yao Yizhong and the Di chieftain Pu Hong against Shi Min and Li Nong. Shi Jian then tried to have the general Sun Fudu (孫伏都), a fellow ethnic Jie, attack Shi Min, but Shi Min quickly defeated him, and Shi Jian, trying to absolve himself, then ordered Shi Min to execute Sun. Shi Min, however, began to realize that Shi Jian was behind Sun&#x27;s attack, and he decided that he needed to disarm the Jie people, who knew that he was not a Jie but ethnically Chinese. He ordered that all non-Chinese not be allowed to carry arms, and most non-Chinese fled Yecheng after that. Shi Min put Shi Jian under house arrest with no outside communication.

As the non-Chinese tribes continued fleeing Yecheng, Shi Min realized that he would not be able to use the Hu (胡 Barbarians), so he issued an order to the ethnic Chinese according to which each civil servant who killed one Hu (胡) and brought his head to him would be promoted in rank by three degrees, and a military officer would be transferred to the service at his Supreme Command. Shi Min himself led Chinese in killing the Hu (胡) people without regard for sex or age; during the day tens of thousands of heads were severed. In total over 200 thousand people were killed; their bodies were dumped outside the city. Troop commanders in various parts of the state received a rescript from Shi Min to kill the Hus (胡); as a result half of the people with high noses and bushy beards were killed. Among the 200,000 people who died in the massacre many were in fact ethnic Chinese who had high big noses, deep-set eyes and thick full beards, which in combination were considered to be the indicators of non-Hanness.

In 350, Shi Jian, still the nominal head of the state, changed the name of his state from Zhao to Wei (衛) and the imperial clan name from Shi to Li (李), under pressure from Shi Min. Many key officials fled to Shi Zhi. Local generals throughout the empire effectively became independent, waiting for the conflict to be resolved. As Shi Min&#x27;s troops were busy against Shi Zhi&#x27;s, Shi Jian made one final attempt against Shi Min, ordering general Zhang Shen (張沈) to attack the capital after Shi Min had left it. However, Shi Jian&#x27;s eunuchs reported that to Shi Min and Li Nong, and they quickly returned to Yecheng and executed Shi Jian, also killing 38 of Shi Hu&#x27;s grandsons and the rest of the Shi clan. Shi Min, restoring his father&#x27;s original family name of Ran (冉), then took the throne as the emperor of a new state, Wei (魏, note different character from the state name declared previously).

== As emperor of Ran Wei ==
Ran Min honored his mother Lady Wang with a title of empress dowager. He appointed his wife Lady Dong an empress, and his oldest son Ran Zhi a crown prince. His other sons and his ally Li Nong were made princes, Li Nong&#x27;s sons were given titles of dukes. He proclaimed a general amnesty, hoping to have the generals who became independent abide by his edicts, but few of them accepted, though most Han generals outwardly did not defy him either. For unknown reasons, he soon killed Li. He sent a letter to Emperor Mu of Jin&#x27;s court with a mixed message, appearing to invite Jin to send forces north and agreeing to submit, but the letter could also be read as a defiant challenge. Jin did not react, although it began to also seek allegiance of the generals in the former territory of Later Zhao southern provinces.

Ran Min&#x27;s brief reign was characterized by rash decisions and massive executions. He would often react violently to advisors who suggested ideas different from his own, including killing them, and then regret those violent reactions after he realized that he was wrong. He also backtracked on his initial policy against the Hu, as he intended to win back their support. He appointed his son, Ran Yin as the Grand Chanyu, tasked with managing the tribes, and executed his official, Wei Xiao (韋謏) for suggesting he continue his hostile treatment towards the Hu. 

In spring 351, Ran Min set a siege of the Shi Zhi&#x27;s capital Xiangguo. Shi Zhi sought aid from Former Yan&#x27;s prince Murong Jun and was able to deal Ran a major defeat. At this time, the Xiongnu soldiers in Yecheng rebelled, captured Ran Yin, and surrendered to Shi Zhi, who executed Ran Yin. Ran Min was thought to be dead, but when he appeared in Yecheng, the city was calmed. Shi Zhi had his general Liu Xian besiege Yecheng, but Ran Min defeated Liu in battle and awed him so much that Liu agreed that once he returned to Xiangguo, he would kill Shi Zhi and surrender. He did so and sent Shi Zhi&#x27;s head to Ran Min, and Ran Min had Shi Zhi&#x27;s head burned on a busy street in Yecheng. Later Zhao was at its final end.

However, wars continued. Liu Xian, after briefly submitting to Ran Min, proclaimed himself emperor. The western provinces were taken over by Fu Jiàn, who established Former Qin. The southern provinces largely switched their allegiance to Jin. Meanwhile, Former Yan, which had already captured Youzhou (modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei) and moved its capital to Jicheng (modern Beijing), continued to advance south. Ran Min, having captured Xiangguo in early 352 and executed Liu Xian, decided to head north to face Former Yan&#x27;s army, against the advice of several officials who felt that his army needed a rest. Former Yan&#x27;s general Murong Ke, Murong Jun&#x27;s brother, pretended to lose several skirmishes and then retreat, tricking Ran Min and his Chinese infantry into the open field, and then used his elite Xianbei cavalry to surround Ran Min&#x27;s infantry, inflicting great losses. Ran Min himself wielded two weapons, one in each hand, and fought fiercely, inflicting many casualties on the Xianbei soldiers. However Ran Min&#x27;s famous horse Zhu Long (&quot;Red Dragon&quot;) suddenly died, and he fell off and was captured. Former Yan&#x27;s forces delivered him to Murong Jun, and he insulted Murong Jun. Murong Jun had him whipped 300 times and then executed, although was soon fearful that his spirit was causing a drought, and therefore honored him with the posthumous name Daowu. Ran Min&#x27;s wife Empress Dong and her son Ran Zhi would hold out for several more months, but eventually surrendered later that year, ending Ran Wei&#x27;s brief existence.

Ran Min is now mostly known for his order to execute all of the Wu Hu, particularly the Jie. Then he fought with Hu armies in Jizhou and led several millions of migrants of different races to flee; on the way they attacked each other and only 2-3/10 people were able to go back to their homelands.

<text>Qiao Zong () (died 413) was a Han Chinese military leader in present-day Sichuan province in China during the Eastern Jin Dynasty. He proclaimed himself the Prince of Chengdu in 405 and was given the title &quot;Prince of Shu&quot; by Yao Xing, ruler of the Later Qin, in 409. His state of Shu () is known in historiography as Qiao Shu () or Western Shu (). His self-governing body coordinated offensive campaigns with Later Qin along the Yangtze River until Qiao&#x27;s state was destroyed by a campaign under military subordinates of Liu Yu in 413.

== Background and establishment of Western Shu ==
Qiao Zong was from Baxi Commandery (巴西, roughly modern Nanchong, Sichuan). By 405, he was a mid-level military commander under the command of Mao Qu (毛璩), the Jin governor of Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing). In 404, the warlord Huan Xuan had usurped the Jin throne from Emperor An, and Mao had, in response, mobilized his forces to ready to attack Huan Xuan, but Huan Xuan was quickly overthrown by Liu Yu, who restored Emperor An. However, Huan Xuan&#x27;s nephew Huan Zhen (桓振) occupied the important city of Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) and continued to resist. Mao therefore continued to advance east, ready to attack Huan Zhen. He divided his forces into two groups, one commanded by his brothers Mao Jin (毛瑾) and Mao Yuan (毛瑗), and one commanded by Qiao Zong and Hou Hui (侯暉).

However, the soldiers of Yi Province were not happy at this long-distance campaign, and when the forces commanded by Qiao and Hou reached Wuchengshuikou (五城水口, in modern Deyang, Sichuan), Hou and another officer, Yang Mo (陽昩), plotted a mutiny. Because Qiao Zong was considered a kind and careful man, the soldiers respected him, and therefore Hou and Yang tried to force Qiao to be their leader. Qiao refused and ran, but as the soldiers closed in on him, he tried to jump into the river to commit suicide, but he was pulled out of the water, and, with swords on his neck, forced to assume a place on a royal litter. Qiao pleaded against it, even prostrating himself on the ground and bowing to the soldiers, but was tied to the litter and forced to &quot;lead&quot; the mutineers. The mutineers then attacked and killed Mao Jin. When Mao Qu tried to respond, he was defeated and killed as well, along with Mao Yuan and their clan. Qiao Zong assumed the title Prince of Chengdu, and set his capital at Chengdu, the capital of Yi Province.

== Reign ==
The traditional histories, such as &quot;Jin Shu&quot; and &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, had little to say about Qiao Zong, but it appeared that he entrusted the important matters of the state and military to his brother Qiao Mingzi (譙明子) and cousins Qiao Hong (譙洪) and Qiao Daofu (譙道福).

In 406, Liu Yu sent the generals Mao Xiuzhi (毛脩之, Mao Jin&#x27;s son), Sima Rongqi (司馬榮期), Wen Chumao (文處茂), and Shi Yanzu (時延祖) to attack Western Shu, but on the way, Sima Rongqi was assassinated by his subordinate Yang Chengzu (楊承祖), and the Jin forces had to retreat to Baidicheng. In 407, Mao Xiuzhi defeated and killed Yang, but Liu Yu sent another general, Liu Jingxuan (劉敬宣), to attack Western Shu. Also around this time, Qiao Zong submitted as a vassal to Later Qin&#x27;s emperor Yao Xing. He also secretly maintained a relationship with Jin&#x27;s governor of Guang Province (廣州, modern Guangdong and Guangxi), Lu Xun (盧循), who was formally a Jin official but had maintained in reality an independent administration over his domain.

In 408, Qiao Zong requested Yao Xing to send Huan Xuan&#x27;s cousin Huan Qian (桓謙) to Chengdu, so that he and Huan Qian could jointly attack Jin. Huan Qian, believing that the people of the western provinces of Jin would follow him, went to Chengdu despite Yao Xing&#x27;s misgivings about Qiao Zong&#x27;s intentions, and when Huan Qian arrived in Chengdu and received welcome from many, Qiao Zong became suspicious and put him under house arrest.

In late 408, Liu Jingxuan advanced to Huanghu (黃虎, in modern Suining, Sichuan), and Qiao Zong sought aid from Later Qin; Yao Xing sent an army to assist him, but at the same time, Qiao Daofu was able to resist Liu Jingxuan&#x27;s advance, and after the armies stalemated for 60 days, Liu Jingxuan&#x27;s army ran out of food supplies and grew ill, and was forced to retreat.

In 409, Yao Xing created Qiao Zong the Prince of Shu, and granted him the nine bestowments.

In fall 410, after Liu Yu had destroyed Southern Yan, Lu Xun took the opportunity to capture much of Jin territory, but then was forced to retreat when Liu Yu returned from his Southern Yan campaign. Qiao Zong then, after approval from Yao Xing, attacked Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei and Hunan) with Huan Qian and the Later Qin general Gou Lin (苟林). They were, however, defeated by Liu Yu&#x27;s brother Liu Daogui (劉道規), and Huan Qian was killed. Qiao Zong withdrew back to his domain, but did manage to, in the process, capture Badong Commandery (巴東, roughly modern Chongqing).

In 412, Liu Yu commissioned the general Zhu Lingshi (朱齡石) to command an army of 20,000 men against Western Shu. He ordered Zhu to take an alternative route than the one that Liu Jingxuan had taken—to bypass Huanghu and head for Chengdu by the circumlocutous route of Min River (岷江), but to avoid dissension and the news being leaked to Western Shu, Liu Yu also sealed his orders and publicly stated to Zhu to have them opened when he reaches Baidicheng. Zhu did so in summer 413, and the orders were as Liu Yu had previously told Zhu. Qiao Zong, not anticipating this, had Qiao Daofu defend the same route that Liu Jingxuan took—by Fu River (涪江), with his army camped at Fucheng (涪城, in modern Mianyang, Sichuan). Only when Zhu reached Pingmo (平模, in modern Leshan, Sichuan) did a Western Shu army, commanded by Hou Hui and Qiao Shen (譙詵) arrive to try to stop Zhu. Zhu attacked and killed Hou and Qiao Shen, and then abandoned his ships and headed directly toward Chengdu, facing little resistance on the way.

Qiao Zong, hearing that Zhu was about to arrive, abandoned Chengdu and fled toward Qiao Daofu&#x27;s camp. His daughter suggested that they commit suicide on the ancestral tombs, but Qiao Zong refused. When he met Qiao Daofu, Qiao Daofu rebuked him for abandoning Chengdu, and he threw his sword at Qiao Zong. Qiao Zong fled but, believing that he could not escape, committed suicide by hanging. Qiao Daofu tried to continue to resist, but his army collapsed, and he was captured and killed by Zhu. Western Shu was at its end.

<doc id="680564" wikidata="Q2640939" url="?curid=680564" title="Central Bank of Sri Lanka">
<text>The Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL; ) is the monetary authority of Sri Lanka. It was established in 1950 under the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 (MLA) and in terms of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act No. 16 of 2023, the CBSL is a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. The Central Bank has administrative and financial autonomy. The CBSL has two main boards in operation, namely, the Governing Board (GB) and the Monetary Policy Board (MPB).

==History==
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka was established in 1950, two years after independence. The founder governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was John Exter, while the minister of finance at the time was J. R. Jayewardene. Under the former name of Central Bank of Ceylon, it replaced the Currency Board that until then had been responsible for issuing the country&#x27;s money. It is a member of the Asian Clearing Union.

The bank&#x27;s main tasks are the conduct of monetary policy in Sri Lanka and also has wide supervisory powers over the financial system.

The bank is engaged in developing policies to promote financial inclusion and is a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI).

With a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka, the CBSL is responsible for securing price stability and financial system stability. The CBSL is also responsible for currency issuance and management. In addition, the CBSL is the advisor on economic affairs as well as the banker to the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL). On behalf of GOSL, the CBSL, as its agent, is responsible for four agency functions, viz. management of the Employees Provident Fund; management of the public debt of Sri Lanka; administration of the provisions of the Exchange Control Act; and administration of foreign and government-funded credit schemes for regional development.

==Organisational structure==

The Governor of the CBSL functions as its chief executive officer. The Governor, Deputy Governors and Assistant Governors, along with the Heads of Departments, form the senior management of the CBSL. Functionally, the CBSL presently consists of 29 departments, each headed by a Director (or equivalent), reporting to the Governor or the Deputy Governor through an Assistant Governor, with the exception of the Management Audit Department, which reports directly to the governor. The Economic Research and Bank Supervision Departments were explicitly set up under the original legislation establishing the CBSL, with certain statutory functions. The Economic Research Department, headed by the Director of Economic Research/Chief Economist, is required to compile data and conduct economic research for the guidance of the Monetary Board and for the information of the public, while the Bank Supervision Department, headed by the Director of Bank Supervision, is required to engage in the continuous regulation and supervision of all banking institutions in Sri Lanka.

The current members of the Governing Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka are:
# Hon. Dr P. Nandalal Weerasinghe (Governor) - Chairman
# Vish Govindasamy - Appointed Member
# Nihal Fonseka - Appointed Member
# Dr. Ravi Rathnayake - Appointed Member

<doc id="680569" wikidata="Q1196298" url="?curid=680569" title="Chouchi">
<text>Chouchi (), or Qiuchi (), was a polity in China ruled by the Yang clan of Di ethnicity in modern-day Gansu Province. Its existence spanned both the Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern and Southern dynasties periods, but it is not listed among one of these regimes in historiography.

==History==
At the beginning of the 3rd century CE, Yang Teng (), chieftain of the White Neck Di (), had occupied the southeast area of modern Gansu province, at the upper course of the Han River. His followers Yang Ju () and Yang Qianwan () paid tribute to the emperors of the Cao-Wei Dynasty and were rewarded with the title of prince ( ). Yang Feilong () shifted the center of the Chouchi realm back to Lüeyang, where his successor Yang Maosou reigned as an independent king at the beginning of the 4th century. The Chouchi troops often plundered territories in the Central Plains to the east and abducted people there, but the troops of Eastern Jin and Han-Zhao deprived the Chouchi empire of some of its people. In 322, Yang Nandi suffered a defeat at the hands of Han-Zhao and was degraded to prince of Wudu () and duke of Chouchi (). The following years were characterized by numerous internal struggles among the Yang clan and several usurpations of the throne. The rulers were not seen as mere regional inspectors ( ) or governors ( ) of their region under the government of Jin.

In 371 Fu Jian, ruler of Former Qin, attacked Chouchi, captured the ruler Yang Cuan () and ended the period of Former Chouchi.

Yang Ding, a great-great-grandson of Yang Maosou, and a son-in-law of Fu Jian, resurrected the Chouchi kingdom in 385, with the capital at Licheng (). His younger brother Yang Sheng () was able to conquer the region of Liangzhou () at the upper course of the Han River, and declared himself governor for the Jin Dynasty. Efforts to occupy the territory of modern Sichuan failed, but Chouchi controlled a large part of the modern provinces of Gansu (east) and Shaanxi (south).

After 443, the lords of Chouchi were only puppet rulers controlled by the Northern and Southern dynasties. Historians talk of the five realms of Chouchi ( ): Former and Later Chouchi ( , ), (), (), and (). Former Chouchi lasted between 296 and 371 while Later Chouchi lasted between 385 and 443. In 443, the Northern Wei conquered Chouchi, but was restored by Yang Wende that same year, beginning the Wudu period, although it could also be seen as a continuation of Later Chouchi. After the death of Yang Wendu in 477, the realm split into Yinping and Wuxing, the former lasting until around the mid-6th century and the latter lasting until 553.

<doc id="680579" wikidata="Q2033868" url="?curid=680579" title="Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet (21 June 1818 – 20 July 1890), of Sudbourne Hall in Suffolk, Hertford House in London, Antrim Castle in the north of Ireland, and 2 Rue Laffitte and Château de Bagatelle, Paris, was a British aristocrat, art collector and Francophile. Based on the Return of Owners of Land 1873, he was the 24th richest man in the United Kingdom and the 73rd largest landowner, holding in total , with a total annual value of £86,737. In addition he had valuable property in Paris and one of the greatest private art collections in the world, part of which, now known as the Wallace Collection, was donated to the UK Government by his widow, in accordance with his wishes.

==Origins and youth ==
Richard is believed to have been the illegitimate son of Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (1800–1870). He was born in London on 26 July 1818, to a certain Agnes Jackson, who according to Burns (2008) was in reality Mrs Agnes Bickley, the wife of Samuel Bickley, an insurance underwriter and member of Lloyds of London, and a daughter of Sir Thomas Dunlop Wallace, 5th Baronet (1750–1835), of Craigie Castle, Ayrshire, born &quot;Thomas Dunlop&quot;, who had adopted the additional name and style of baronet on inheriting the Craigie estate of his grandfather Sir Thomas Wallace, 4th Baronet. It is unclear why his mother had adopted the surname Jackson, as she remained married to Samuel Bickley at the time of Richard&#x27;s birth and bore Samuel legitimate children both before and after the birth.

Richard&#x27;s natural father, the 4th Marquess of Hertford, after whom he supposedly gained his first name, would have been 18 years old at his birth, and is supposed by Burns (2008) to have met Agnes in Brighton whilst serving in the 10th Hussars Regiment. He never married and Richard was his only offspring.

However, it was previously thought possible that he was the uterine half-brother of the 4th Marquess, being a son by father unknown of Maria Emilia Fagnani, Marchioness of Hertford (1771–1856) (&quot;Mie-Mie&quot;), the estranged wife of Francis Charles Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford (1777–1842) and mother of the 4th Marquess. Later in life, after 1870 during his court case concerning his contested inheritance from the 4th Marquess, Richard declined the opportunity to put his origins on public record, stating merely that &quot;he had been brought from London to Paris in 1825 aged 7 with his nurse&quot;. It is however recorded in surviving correspondence that the 4th Marquess had given his second cousin Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford &quot;the most solemn assurance that he was not Mr. Wallace&#x27;s father.&quot; It is possible that Wallace himself did not know the truth of the matter. However, he did at some point discover that his mother&#x27;s maiden name was Wallace, and on 21 April 1842, aged 24, he was baptised in the Anglican Church in the Rue d&#x27;Aguesseau in Paris under the surname Wallace, with the certificate of baptism recording simply that the name of his parents was Wallace. Thenceforth he was known as Richard Wallace.

===Move to France===
In 1825, aged seven and known as &quot;Richard Jackson&quot;, his mother Agnes Jackson left him in Paris under the care and education of &quot;Mie-Mie&quot;, the mother of the 4th Marquess, who lived at 1 Rue Taitbout, 50 metres from the house of her son at 2 Rue Laffitte. Richard lived with Mie-Mie for the next 17 years until 1842 (two years after he had fathered his own son by his mistress) and the two developed a close bond. The 4th Marquess mentioned in his will the kindness that Richard had shown to his mother. He referred to her as &quot;Aunt&quot; and she to him as &quot;Dear Nephew&quot;. This close relationship may have been sealed by the fact that both were illegitimate, Mie-Mie being the natural daughter of the 4th Duke of Queensbury by his Italian mistress. &quot;They both suffered the stigma of illegitimacy, at a time when bloodlines in humans were as important as in horses. They both had to endure whispered gossip the moment they turned their backs, and the trail of scandal wherever they went&quot; (Fairweather, 2021). Long after her death Wallace erected a monument to Mie-Mie in Sudbourne Church (the only one there to a Hertford in 120 years of residence) in the form of the stained-glass east window depicting Mary Magdalene, the prostitute who washed Jesus&#x27;s feet with oil but was also the first person to witness the Resurrection, which Fairweather (2021) suspected to be &quot;an intentional reference to Mie-Mie&#x27;s circumstances&quot;.

==Career==
Most of his youth and early manhood were spent in Paris, &quot;where as &quot;Monsieur Richard&quot; he became a well-known figure in French society and among those who devoted themselves to matters of art&quot;. He was appointed by the 4th Marquess as his secretary and agent, on a salary of £500, later raised to £1,000. In this capacity he became expert in assessing, valuing and buying works for the famous collector. Before he was forty he had made his own large collection including objets d&#x27;art, bronzes, ivories and miniatures, which collection he sold profitably in Paris in 1857, in order to pay off debts.

==Inheritance==
In 1870 his father the 4th Marquess died without legitimate issue, and the titles and entailed estates, including Ragley Hall in Warwickshire and Sudbourne, passed under an entail to his second cousin, who became the 5th Marquess. However Wallace inherited his father&#x27;s unentailed estates and extensive collection of European art.

===Lisburn, County Antrim, Ireland===
His vast estate in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, extending to over , produced an annual income of £50,000 (£7 million in 2022). The area was the centre of the flax and linen industry. When Wallace visited it for the first time after his inheritance, accompanied by his wife and son, he was greeted by a crowd of 20,000 people and was welcomed in an elaborate series of ceremonies by the chief citizens. Even though at that time Lisburn was no longer the pocket borough it had been under the Hertford family before the Reform Act of 1832, Wallace was invited to stand as its Member of Parliament, and being unopposed, won the seat and so began his parliamentary career. He built a grand residence in the town for himself, called Wallace House, more exactly intended for his son whom he intended to establish there to perform the functions of a great landlord, designed by the same architect who had remodelled Hertford House. He made many large charitable donations to the town, and was reputedly admired by the inhabitants. After his death various monuments were erected in his memory including two stained glass windows in Lisburn Cathedral, on the south wall of the chancel and on the south wall of the nave, one financed by public subscription, the other by Lady Wallace. In &quot;grateful recognition of his generous interest in the prosperity of the town&quot;, in 1892 residents of the town erected a memorial in Castle Gardens. The Wallace Memorial comprises a 40 foot high stone and marble &quot;square-plan tower with a steep crocketed spire topped with a poppy head finial, the front gable bearing a date and coat of arms, niches on each façade, one bearing a bust of the subject above an inscribed tablet, and on a three-stepped octagonal base&quot;. It is inscribed:
::To perpetuate the memory of one whose delight was to do good and in grateful recollection of his generous interest in the prosperity of this town of which it possesses so many proofs this monument is erected to Sir Richard Wallace, Bart., KGI, sometime MP for the Borough of Lisburn, by the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood Obiit Jul. XX, MDCCCXC.

His bequests to the town included the Wallace Park and The Wallace High School. His town house on Castle Street is now used as offices by the South Eastern Regional College.

===Sudbourne===

Wallace repurchased Sudbourne from the 5th Marquess, for £298,000. It was a notable sporting estate of about , which became his English country seat and where he held lavish shooting parties, guests at which included the Prince of Wales. He employed 24 liveried gamekeepers and &quot;a small army of domestic servants&quot; to cater for his shooting guests. He commissioned three large oil paintings by the French artist Alfred Charles Ferdinand Decaen, depicting his shooting parties (&quot;On Sudbourne Hill&quot; (1874); &quot;Shooting Luncheon at the Great Wood Sudbourne&quot; (1876); &quot;Battue de perdreaux dans la comté de Suffolk&quot; (1880)), now displayed in Orford Town Hall. He was Honorary President of Ipswich Museum in Suffolk from 1874 until his death. In 1875 he built a model farm at nearby Chillesford Lodge on the estate, which survives today, displaying on some of the buildings his heraldic crest, also visible on several other houses and buildings erected by him on the estate. In 1883 he won a silver medal at the Smithfield Show as breeder of the best &quot;Single Pig&quot; in class LXXXVI. During 1879–82 he restored Sudbourne Church, and presented it with new furnishings.

In 1877 Wallace appointed as Rector of Sudbourne and Orford parish churches Rev. Edward Maude Scott, the brother of his secretary and eventual heir Sir John Murray Scott, 1st Baronet. The latter is buried in Orford Churchyard beneath a tall stone cross within iron railings. Rev. Scott was instrumental in restoring St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in Orford between 1894 and 1901. In 1884 Wallace sold Sudbourne to the banker Arthur Heywood, and returned to Paris, having become disappointed in his ambition to found his own aristocratic dynasty due to his son&#x27;s refusal to live in England and Queen Victoria&#x27;s refusal to allow the latter to inherit his baronetcy, due to illegitimacy.

===Château de Bagatelle===

He also inherited the Château de Bagatelle, Neuilly-sur-Seine, with its garden in the Bois de Boulogne, Paris, which his widow bequeathed, together with Hertford House in London and 2 Rue Laffitte, to Sir John Edward Arthur Murray Scott, 1st Baronet (1847–1912) &quot;of Connaught Place&quot;, London. Scott was the eldest son of Dr. John Scott, a physician at Boulogne-sur-Seine, and had been appointed as Wallace&#x27;s secretary, in which capacity he had helped with the charity work and with Wallace&#x27;s return to England, together with his art collection, after the Siege of Paris. Scott remained as the principal advisor to Lady Wallace in her widowhood. In Scott&#x27;s time it is described by Vita Sackville-West in &quot;Pepita&quot; (1937).

===2 Rue Laffitte, Paris===
2 Rue Laffitte, Paris, formerly the &quot;hôtel d&#x27;Aubeterre&quot; or townhouse of the Aubeterre family, with a full-height bowed-projection at the corner, was situated on the corner of Rue Laffitte and the Boulevard des Italiens. It faced on the other side of the Rue Laffitte the famous Restaurant de la Maison-d&#x27;Or. The street contained the shops of several art dealers. It was purchased by the 4th Marquess of Hertford, when his mother vacated it to live at 1 rue Taitbout, the next street 50 metres to the west. After Wallace&#x27;s death it was eventually inherited by his secretary Sir John Murray Scott, during whose ownership the house and contents are described by Vita Sackville-West in &quot;Pepita&quot;, her biography of her mother Lady Sackville (Scott&#x27;s mistress), who ultimately inherited the contents, which she sold in 1914 to the dealer Jacques Seligmann for £270,000 (£35 million in 2022) and of which the Wallace Collection was therefore deprived: 
:A vast apartment on the first floor turning the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens and the Rue Laffitte with twenty windows opening on either street was in itself a treasure-house which brought visitors from every part of Europe. I shall never forget the enchantment of that house. From the moment one had pulled the string and the big door had swung open admitting one to the interior courtyard where grooms in wooden clogs seemed perpetually to be washing carriages; the whole house belonged to him though he reserved only the first floor for himself ... the real glory of the house lay in the main apartment—room after room opened one into the other so that standing in the middle one could look down a vista of shining brown parquet floors at ivory-coloured boisieries on either side. Here indeed one had the 18th century illusion at its height. All around silent and sumptuous stood the priceless furniture of the Wallace Collection.

===Queensberry Estate, Newmarket, Suffolk===
This estate came to the Hertfords via Mie-Mie, wife of the 3rd Marquess and illegitimate daughter of the 4th Duke of Queensbury. The Bury and Norwich Post reported on 3 January 1882: &quot;It is stated that Sir Richard Wallace has decided upon laying out and cutting up his Queensberry Estate, at Newmarket, for building purposes. They include two estates, one at either end of the town, so that persons wishing to reside near the race-course or near the railway can have their choice. As the town of Newmarket extends, these estates will become incorporated with it. The architect entrusted by Sir R. Wallace with the laying out of the estate is Mr. R. A. Came, of 27, Mecklenburg Square&quot;.

==Marriage and illegitimate issue==

On 15 February 1871, six months after the death of the 4th Marquess and having received his paternal inheritance, he married his long-term mistress Amélie Julie Charlotte Castelnau (1819–1897), known as Amélie, whom he had met in his youth when she was working as a dressmaker or sales-assistant in a perfume shop, an illegitimate daughter of Bernard Castelnau, said by some sources to have been &quot;a French officer&quot; and by others &quot;a 36-year-old homme de confiance (factotum)&quot; with her mother being an &quot;ouvrière en linge (linen maid)&quot;. Thirty years before the marriage he had an illegitimate son by Amélie, named Georges Henry Edmond Castelnau (1840–1887), (later known as &quot;Edmond Richard Wallace&quot;) born in 1840 (who predeceased his parents). In 1842, two years after the birth of his son, Richard Jackson was christened as &quot;Richard Wallace&quot;, possibly in anticipation of a church wedding to Amélie, at which he would require a certificate of baptism. On 24 November 1871, six months after the marriage, Wallace was created a baronet, &quot;of Hertford House, London&quot;, for his philanthropy to English ex-patriots during the Siege of Paris and the couple moved to England, where Amélie, by then Lady Wallace, lived from 1872 until her death in 1897. Amélie was not the ideal wife for Wallace in his new station in life as a famous millionaire socialite and art-collector as she spoke no English, and refused to do so, did not enjoy social events and with little interest in fine art was said to have unrefined taste. Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild wrote of her that &quot;she dragged him down to her level, clogged his whole future, and marred all his prospects&quot;. After Wallace&#x27;s final return to France she spent the rest of her life at Hertford House in London. By Amélie he had, before the marriage, one son, which made him permanently illegitimate under English law (but not under French law) and therefore unable to inherit the baronetcy:
*Capt. Edmond Richard Wallace (1840–1887), who in 1849 was baptized &quot;Georges Henry Edmond Castelnau&quot;, but who on 11 February 1871, aged 31, was officially and legally recognised by Wallace as his son under the name &quot;Edmond Richard Wallace&quot;. He served in the French army during the Prussian War, under General Joseph Vinoy, and was made a chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur. Bohemian by nature, he was unwilling to conform to Wallace&#x27;s wish for him to become an English gentleman and to reside on the Lisburn estate in Northern Ireland. He had for many years as the heir apparent dutifully attended his father in England during important events, for example the first ceremonial visit to Lisburn, and at the shooting parties at Sudbourne, but his attendance became increasingly rare as he spent more time in France. Rather than marrying a suitable English lady, he felt loyalty to his mistress Suzanne Amélie Gall and to his four illegitimate children, and his decision to remain in France caused a split with his parents which was unresolved at the time of his early death in 1887, aged 47, predeceasing both parents. He left the following illegitimate issue, three boys and one girl, who were all largely unrecognised by Wallace and his wife:
**General Georges Richard Wallace (1872–1941), of the French Army, eldest son. He served in World War I as a captain in the 22nd Dragoons, was wounded five times and mentioned nine times in dispatches for conspicuous gallantry, for which he was appointed as a Commander of the Legion of Honour and received the Croix de Guerre. In 1980 his three daughters were living, one of whom Odette Wallace (1911–2000) married Jacques Pol-Roger, head of the champage house of that name. Her friendship with Winston Churchill led to the house developing the Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill. 
**Henry Richard Wallace (1875–1942), second son, a soldier who became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.
**Lt. Edmond Richard Wallace (1876–28 February 1915), who was &quot;killed at point blank range by a bullet in the head&quot; at Vauquois on the Meuse, his regiment having been destroyed. He is honoured on his death certificate as &quot;Died for France&quot;. 
**Georgette Wallace (1878–1947), a noted opera singer known as &quot;Lucy Arbell&quot;.

==Return to France==
Following the refusal of Queen Victoria to allow him a special remainder for his baronetcy to descend to his illegitimate son, and the estrangement of the latter in 1879 and the latter&#x27;s death in 1887, Wallace&#x27;s dream of creating his own English dynasty crumbled, and he returned to France to live in retirement at the Bagatelle. He attempted to plan the donation of his Collection to the British government, but his poor health and decreasing interest in business matters led to no progress. His wife remained in England at Hertford House, where she lived with their secretary John Murray Scott, who became to her as an adopted son.

==Wallace Collection==
Wallace expanded the art collection built by his grandfather and father, the 3rd and 4th Marquesses of Hertford, mainly with additions of mediaeval and Renaissance objects and European arms and armour. The Wallace Collection remains today in its essential character the product of the 4th Marquess, &quot;one of the greatest collectors of the nineteenth century&quot;, whom Wallace, as his secretary and agent for many years, assisted in its management. Wallace&#x27;s widow, to whom he bequeathed all his property, in turn bequeathed the Wallace Collection to the nation in 1897, as her husband had wished, and with the encouragement of John Murray Scott. The bequest comprised only the works of art on the ground and first floors of Hertford House, but everything else (the lease of Hertford House, the Rue Laffitte house, the Chateau de Bagatelle in Paris, and the Lisburn estate in Ireland) was bequeathed by Lady Wallace to John Murray Scott. The Collection is now located in Hertford House in Manchester Square, London, Wallace&#x27;s townhouse, which the Government purchased from Sir John Murray Scott.

==Siege of Paris==
Wallace achieved fame during the Siege of Paris for notable acts of charity.

At his own expense, Wallace organized two full scale ambulances to operate during the siege; one to serve French wounded, and the second for the benefit of sick and destitute Britons.
By the end of the siege, Wallace is estimated to have privately contributed as much as 2.5 million (1870) francs to the needy of Paris. This is perhaps equivalent to $6.5 million in 2010 money. As a result, Wallace was thought to be the most popular British citizen inhabiting Paris during the siege. The last balloon to leave Paris before its capitulation was named for him, as was a Paris boulevard. After the destruction of the Protestant Temple in Neuilly-sur-Seine, he financed its reconstruction in 1872. He was appointed to the &quot;Legion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; for his efforts.

Wallace was created baronet in 1871 and was a Conservative and Unionist Member of Parliament for Lisburn from 1873 to 1885. In 1872 he donated 50 drinking fountains, known as Wallace fountains, to Paris and to Lisburn. Some can still be seen today. Thaxton Village, Lisburn, has a network of streets named after Sir Richard and Lady Wallace.

He died unexpectedly at the Chateau de Bagatelle on 20 July 1890 and was buried in the Hertford family&#x27;s mausoleum in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

== Archives ==
A number of letters written to Wallace by members of the British Royal Family are held at the Cadbury Research Library (University of Birmingham), along with letters written to his secretary John Murray Scott.

<text>Shinny (also shinney, pick-up hockey, [[pond hockey]], or &quot;outdoor puck&quot;) is an informal type of hockey played on ice. It is also used as another term for street hockey. There are no formal rules or specific positions, and often, there are no goaltenders. The goal areas at each end may be marked by nets, or simply by objects, such as stones or blocks of snow. Body checking and lifting or &quot;roofing/reefing/raising the puck&quot; (shooting the puck or ball so it rises above the ice) are often forbidden because the players are not wearing protective equipment. Shinny is a game that all levels of hockey enthusiasts can play because it requires no rink, requires no skills except ability to hold a stick and at the very least to try to touch the puck or ball when it goes by. Shinny may be completely non-competitive and recreational.

In his book &quot;Country on Ice&quot;, Doug Beardsley claims that most Canadian hockey professional players have played some form of shinny in their youth.

==Team formation==
There is a common ritual for choosing teams, which has each player &quot;throwing&quot; their hockey stick into a pile at centre ice, or the middle area between two nets. A player then divides the pile into two smaller piles, ostensibly at random, but perhaps strategically assigning sticks to one side or another. Players then pick up their own sticks, the teams having been formed.

Teams are often formed with intent to divide the group into approximately equal levels of skills among the players. Players joining after play has started are usually told &quot;which way they are going&quot; (which net they should shoot towards) based upon the score of the game and their skill level. Some games continue for many hours with a variety of players participating for as long as they want.

==History and name origin==
A game with similarities to shinny, but played on dirt, not ice, is widely reported in memoirs and ethnographic literature among Native American tribes throughout North America and may be its origin – for example, Thomas Jefferson Mayfield&#x27;s memoir of his adopted boyhood among the Indians of Kings River, California (&quot;Indian Summer&quot;, Berkeley, Heyday, 1993). Sports historian Margaret Ann Hall describes this indigenous game as using curved sticks to hit a small ball, made of wood or stuffed deerskin, across a field of dirt or ice and between a pair of posts at either end of the field. According to Hall, the game was mainly a women&#x27;s sport while lacrosse was mainly played by men. Shinny, generally believed to be a precursor to ice hockey, was informal enough in its formative years that the pucks and sticks were often makeshift. During the Great Depression, for example, northern boys used tree branches or broomhandles as sticks, a tin can, a piece of wood, and even a frozen road apple (horse dropping) as a puck. Any object about the right size might serve as a puck.

The name is derived from the Scottish game shinty and indeed shinny was a common name for one of shinty&#x27;s many regional variations in Scotland. Shinny, a primarily Canadian term, is usually called &quot;pick-up hockey&quot; or &quot;pond hockey&quot; in the United States.

A myth perpetuates in Canada that the name is derived from children tying Eaton&#x27;s catalogues around their legs (especially goalies) as a makeshift type of shinguard.

==Institutionalized usage==
In some municipalities around the world where the climate permits, part of a city&#x27;s taxes may go to the formal set-up and maintenance of skating rinks designed specifically for shinny. In some cities, such as Montreal, Edmonton, and Calgary, numerous rinks are erected and are maintained by civil servants throughout the winter as long as the weather allows their usage to continue.

The city of Toronto hosts free or low-cost shinny sessions and also has programs for adults to learn how to play hockey on city rinks. Toronto has more outdoor mechanically cooled rinks than any city in the world, with 54 outdoor mechanically cooled rinks currently in operation

The programs, expanded in 2011, include parent/child shinny and two levels of beginner, and are supervised by city-paid coaches.

<text>William Wirt (November 8, 1772 – February 18, 1834) was an American author and statesman who is credited with turning the position of United States Attorney General into one of influence. He was the longest-serving attorney general in U.S. history. He was also the Anti-Masonic nominee for president in the 1832 election.

Wirt grew up in Maryland but pursued a legal career in Virginia, passing the Virginia bar in 1792. After holding various positions, he served as the prosecutor in Aaron Burr&#x27;s trial for treason. He won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1808 and was appointed as a United States Attorney in 1816. The following year, President James Monroe appointed him to the position of United States Attorney General. Wirt remained in that office for the next twelve years, serving under Monroe and John Quincy Adams. He continued his law career after leaving office, representing the Cherokee in &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot;.

Though Wirt was himself a former Freemason, the Anti-Masonic Party nominated him for president in 1832. Wirt did not actively campaign for office and refused to publicly speak against Masonry. Nonetheless, the ticket of Wirt and Amos Ellmaker carried the state of Vermont, becoming the first third party presidential ticket to win a state. After the election, Wirt continued to practice law until his death in 1834. Wirt County, West Virginia, is named in Wirt&#x27;s honor.

==Biography==
William Wirt was born in Bladensburg, Maryland, to a German mother, Henrietta, and a Swiss German father, Jacob Wirt. Both of his parents died before he was eight years old and Jasper Wirt, his uncle, became his guardian. Between his seventh and his eleventh year Wirt was sent to several classical schools and finally to one kept by the Reverend James Hunt in Montgomery County, where he received over the course of four years the chief part of his education. For two years he boarded with Hunt, in whose library he spent much of his time, reading with a keen and indiscriminate appetite. In his 15th year the school was disbanded, and his inheritance nearly exhausted.

Ninian Edwards (later governor of Illinois) had been Wirt&#x27;s schoolmate, and Edwards&#x27;s father, Benjamin Edwards (later a member of Congress from Maryland), thought Wirt had more than ordinary natural ability and invited him to reside with his family as tutor to Ninian and two nephews, offering him also the use of his library for his own studies. Wirt accepted the offer and stayed twenty months, teaching, pursuing his own classical and historical studies, writing, and preparing for the bar.

===Career===
Wirt was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1792, and he began practice at Culpeper Courthouse. Wirt had the advantages of a vigorous constitution and a good carriage, but the drawbacks of meager legal equipment, constitutional shyness, and brusque and indistinct speech.
In 1795, he married Mildred, daughter of Dr. George Gilmer, and moved to Pen Park, where Gilmer lived, near Charlottesville. There he made the acquaintance of many persons of eminence, including Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe. For a time, Wirt took advantage of the hospitality of the country gentlemen and the convivial habits of the members of the bar so that he was regarded by other attorneys as a &quot;bon vivant,&quot; a fascinating, cheerful, and lively companion, rather than as an ambitious lawyer.
In 1799 his wife died, and he moved to Richmond, where he became clerk of the Virginia House of Delegates, then chancellor of the Eastern District of Virginia, resigning after six months. In 1802, he married Elizabeth Washington Gamble, the daughter of Colonel Robert Gamble of Richmond. In the winter of 1803/04, Wirt moved to Norfolk, but in 1806, wishing for a wider field of practice, returned to Richmond.
In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson asked him to be the prosecutor in Aaron Burr&#x27;s trial for treason. His principal speech, four hours in length, was characterized by eloquent appeal, polished wit, and logical reasoning. It greatly extended his fame. The passage in which he depicted in glowing colors the home of Harman Blennerhassett and &quot;the wife of his bosom, whom he lately permitted not the winds of summer &#x27;to visit too roughly&#x27;&quot;, as &quot;shivering at midnight on the wintry banks of the Ohio, and mingling her tears with the torrents that froze as they fell&quot;, was for many years a favorite piece for academic declamation. Wirt was nicknamed the &quot;Whip Syllabub Genius&quot; by his enemies for the frothy, over-the-top nature of his oratory.

In 1808, Wirt was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. In 1816, he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of Virginia, and in 1817 President James Monroe named him the ninth Attorney General of the United States, a position he held for over 11 years, through the administration of John Quincy Adams, until 1829. William Wirt has the record for the longest tenure in history of any U.S. attorney general.

In 1824, Attorney General Wirt argued for the United States against Daniel Webster in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; that the federal patent laws preempted New York State&#x27;s patent grant to steamboat inventor Robert Fulton&#x27;s successor, Aaron Ogden, of the exclusive right to operate a steamboat between New York and New Jersey in the Hudson River. Wirt argued &quot;that a power in the States to grant exclusive patents, is utterly inconsistent with the power given to the national government to grant such exclusive patents: and hence, that the power given to Congress is one which is exclusive from its nature.&quot; Although the &quot;Gibbons&quot; Court declined to decide the question, 140 years later the Supreme Court confirmed Wirt&#x27;s view in &quot;Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.&quot;

In June 1830, a delegation of Cherokee led by Chief John Ross selected Wirt on the urging of Senators Webster and Frelinghuysen to defend Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court. Wirt argued, in &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot;, that the Cherokee Nation was &quot;a &quot;foreign nation&quot; in the sense of our constitution and law&quot; and was therefore not subject to Georgia&#x27;s jurisdiction. Wirt asked the Supreme Court to void all Georgia laws extended over Cherokee territory on the grounds that they violated the U.S. Constitution, United States–Cherokee treaties, and United States intercourse laws. Although the Court determined that it did not have original jurisdiction in this case, the Court held open the possibility that it yet might rule in favor of the Cherokee. Wirt therefore waited for a test case to again resolve the constitutionality of the laws of Georgia. On March 1, 1831, Georgia passed a law aimed at evicting missionaries, who were perceived as encouraging the Cherokee resistance to removal from Cherokee lands. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, an interdenominational missionary organization, hired Wirt to challenge the new law. On March 3, 1832, the decision in &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;, authored by Chief Justice John Marshall, held that the Cherokee Nation was &quot;a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately described, in which the laws of Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter but with the assent of the Cherokees themselves or in conformity with treaties and with the acts of Congress&quot;.

===Societies===
During the 1820s, Wirt was a member of the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which included as members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.

Wirt was also an honorary member of the American Whig–Cliosophic Society and associated with the Delphian Club.

===Later life and presidential run===
After leaving his position as attorney general, Wirt settled in Baltimore, Maryland. He became a candidate for president in 1832, nominated by the Anti-Masonic Party. This party held the first ever national nominating convention in U.S. history on September 11, 1830, in Philadelphia establishing the tradition. The date was chosen to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Morgan Affair. However, no candidate was agreed upon. The actual nomination occurred a year later during the second convention in Baltimore. On September 28, 1831, Wirt became a presidential candidate after the fifth ballot. Amos Ellmaker became his running mate. Wirt is the only person from Maryland to ever become a presidential candidate who won any electoral votes.

Wirt was, in fact, a former Freemason. He had taken the first two degrees of Freemasonry in Jerusalem Lodge #54 Richmond, Virginia becoming a &quot;fellow craft&quot;, or second degree, mason. Wirt wrote in his acceptance letter to the nominating convention that he found Freemasonry unobjectionable and that in his experience many Masons were &quot;intelligent men of high and honourable character&quot; who would never choose Freemasonry above &quot;their duties to their God and country&quot;.

Historian William Vaughn wrote, &quot;Wirt was possibly the most reluctant and most unwilling presidential candidate ever nominated by an American party.&#x27; After being selected Wirt started to regret his nomination and distanced himself from actual campaigning. He admitted later, &quot;In the canvass I took no part, not even by writing private letters, which, on the contrary, I refused to answer whenever such answers could be interpreted into canvassing for office.&quot; In private conversations Wirt criticized Masonry for alleged intent to create international order ruled from Europe, but refused all Antimasonic attempts to make his sentiments public. He hoped for enthusiastic national support to an electoral alliance between Anti-Masons and National Republicans that would overpower the Jacksonian Democrats. When his expectations did not materialize, he wrote in frustration about his presidential aspirations: &quot;What the use ... it neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket.&quot; In the election, Wirt carried Vermont with seven electoral votes, becoming the first candidate of an organized third party to carry a state, and he remains the only presidential candidate so successful who came from Maryland. When &quot;The Providence American&quot; newspaper suggested that Wirt could run again in 1836, he quickly declined.

In 1833, Wirt became involved with his son-in-law in establishing a German immigrant colony in Florida on lands that he bought but never inspected personally; this business venture failed.

Wirt practiced law until his death. He fell sick on February 8, 1834, in Washington, D.C., where he attended the proceedings of the Supreme Court. His biographer John P. Kennedy wrote that the early diagnosis of a cold was followed by identifying the symptoms of erysipelas or St. Anthony&#x27;s fire. He died on February 18, 1834.

Wirt&#x27;s last rites were attended by President Jackson and members of his cabinet; John Quincy Adams read a eulogy address in the House of Representatives. William Wirt was buried in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

The house he occupied in Richmond from 1816 to 1818, known as the Hancock-Wirt-Caskie House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

==Published works==

Wirt&#x27;s earliest work was &quot;Letters of the British Spy&quot;, which he first contributed to the Richmond &quot;Argus&quot; in 1803, and which won immediate popularity. The letters are chiefly studies of eloquence and eloquent men, are written in a vivid and luxuriant style, and may be regarded, in spite of the exceptional excellence of &quot;The Blind Preacher&quot;, as rather a prophecy of literary skill than its fulfilment. They were soon afterward issued in book form (Richmond, 1803; 10th ed., with a biographical sketch of the author by Peter H. Cruse, New York, 1832).

In 1808 Wirt wrote for the Richmond &quot;Enquirer&quot; essays entitled &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, and in 1810, with Dabney Carr, George Tucker, and others, a series of didactic and ethical essays, entitled &quot;The Old Bachelor&quot;, which, collected, passed through several editions (2 vols., 1812). These papers treat of female education, Virginian manners, the fine arts, and especially oratory. An essay from this collection, &quot;Eloquence of the Pulpit&quot;, a vigorous and passionate protest against coldness in this genre, has been singled out for praise.

In October 1826, Wirt delivered before the citizens of Washington a discourse on the lives and characters of the ex-presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, who had died on 4 July of the same year (Washington, 1826). The London &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, in a paper on American oratory several years afterward, pronounced this discourse &quot;the best which this remarkable coincidence has called forth&quot;. In 1830 Wirt delivered an address to the literary societies of Rutgers College, which, after its publication by the students (New Brunswick, 1830), was republished in England, and translated into French and German.

His other publications are:
* &quot;The Two Principal Arguments in the Trial of Aaron Burr&quot; (Richmond, 1808)
* &quot;Sketches of the Life and Character of Patrick Henry&quot; (Philadelphia, 1817) This work has been severely criticized both for its hero worship and its style, the subject of the biography having been regarded by many as a creation of Wirt rather than Patrick Henry. The book contained the supposed text of some of Henry&#x27;s speeches, many of which had never been published. Some historians have since speculated that some of Henry&#x27;s phrases that have since become famous, such as &quot;Give me Liberty or give me Death!&quot;, were fabricated by Wirt for this book. Even Wirt&#x27;s contemporary Thomas Jefferson shelved his copy of the biography under fiction.
* &quot;Address on the Triumph of Liberty in France&quot; (Baltimore, 1830)
* &quot;Letters by John Q. Adams and William Wirt to the Anti-Masonic Committee for York County&quot; (Boston, 1831)
Wirt had the distinction of being regarded for many years as the chief man of letters in the South.

==Grave robbery==
In the early 2000s, after a series of mysterious phone calls to the cemetery, it was discovered that in the 1970s someone had broken into the Wirt Tomb at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Congressional Cemetery and had stolen Wirt&#x27;s skull. After the skull was recovered from the house of a historical memorabilia collector, Robert L. White, it spent time in D.C. Council member Jim Graham&#x27;s office while he tried to get it returned to its rightful crypt. Finally in 2005 investigators from the Smithsonian Institution were able to determine the skull, which had gold block letters saying &quot;Hon. Wm. Wirt&quot; painted on the tin box containing it, was indeed his and had it returned.

==Major cases argued==
* &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;
* &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;
* &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot;
* &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;

<text>Calorie restriction mimetics (CRM), also known as energy restriction mimetics, are a hypothetical class of dietary supplements or drug candidates that would, in principle, mimic the substantial anti-aging effects that calorie restriction (CR) has on many laboratory animals and humans. CR is defined as a reduction in calorie intake of 20% (mild CR) to 50% (severe CR) without incurring malnutrition or a reduction in essential nutrients. An effective CRM would alter the key metabolic pathways involved in the effects of CR itself, leading to preserved youthful health and longer lifespan without the need to reduce food intake. The term was coined by Lane, Ingram, Roth of the National Institute on Aging in a seminal 1998 paper in the &quot;Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine&quot;, the forerunner of &quot;Rejuvenation Research&quot;. A number of genes and pathways have been shown to be involved with the actions of CR in model organisms and these represent attractive targets for drug discovery and for developing CRM. However, no effective CRM have been identified to date.
== Candidates ==
Candidate compounds include:
* Resveratrol (3,5,4&#x27;-trihydroxy-&quot;trans&quot;-stilbene) is a stilbenoid, a type of natural phenol, and a phytoalexin produced naturally by several plants, including grapes, and especially the roots of the Japanese Knotweed, from which it is extracted commercially. Resveratrol was proposed to be a CRM based on a series of early reports which found that it increased the lifespan of yeasts, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and fruit flies. Scientists involved in these studies went on to found Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, a company working to develop resveratrol analogs as proprietary drugs. This led many companies to produce and market resveratrol dietary supplements. However, studies by independent scientists have failed to replicate these results. Moreover, in every experiment to date, resveratrol at several doses has failed to extend the lifespan of lean, genetically normal mice or rats.
* The antidiabetic drug metformin was proposed as a possible CRM after it was found that mice administered the drug exhibit similar gene expression changes as CR mice. It is already clinically approved to treat diabetes, and has been used for this indication for the past 40 years. It enhances the sensitivity of insulin receptors on the surface of muscle and fat cells and activates genes that reduce the production of glucose by the liver, thus reducing the risk of non-enzymatic glycation and other age-related damage; these effects are also seen in CR. Subsequently, metformin was reported to extend the lifespan of short-lived or genetically cancer-prone mouse strains. However, two studies in rats and mice with normal genetics and longevity have found no effect of metformin on maximum lifespan, and only a very small effect on median lifespan.
* Oxaloacetate is a metabolic intermediate of the citric acid cycle. In the short-lived roundworm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, supplementation with oxaloacetate increases the ratio of reduced to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+:NADH) to activate AMPK and FOXO signaling pathways similar to what occurs in calorie restriction. The increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio is due to the reaction of oxaloacetate to malate in the cytoplasm via the enzyme malate dehydrogenase. In mitochondria that have been isolated out of cells and tested in oxaloacetate-enriched medium, this increase can be quite dramatic. Decreases in the NAD+/NADH ratio has been proposed as a carbohydrate metabolism-controlled cellular senescence mechanism.

:Because of its parallel effects on these pathways, oxaloacetate was proposed as a CR mimetic. In the short-lived roundworm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, supplementing the medium with oxaloacetate does increase average life expectancy; it was unclear whether it had an effect on maximum lifespan. However, when tested by two independent groups of scientists across four university laboratories, oxaloacetate supplements had no effect on lifespan in healthy laboratory mice.
* Rimonabant (Acomplia) is an anti-obesity drug initially approved for use in the European Union but later withdrawn due to psychiatric side effects including anxiety and depression. Rimonabant was never approved by the FDA for use in the United States. This is an endocannabinoid-1 receptor blocker. Endocannabinoids are cannabis-like chemicals that stimulate appetite and also regulate energy balance. Overstimulation of the endocannabinoid receptor in the hypothalamus promotes appetite and stimulates lipogenesis. It also blocks the beneficial actions of adiponectin. Rimonabant inhibits these and so it reduces appetite, balances energy, and increases adiponectin, which reduces intra-abdominal fat. It improves lipid profile, glucose tolerance, and waist measurement, and is therefore comparable in effect to calorie restriction (CR).
* Lipoic Acid (α-Lipoic Acid, Alpha Lipoic Acid, or ALA) has failed to extend lifespan in normal mice or rats in numerous studies, either alone or as part of combination therapy.
* 2-deoxy-D-glucose, or 2DG. 2-Deoxyglucose was the first agent pursued as a possible CRM. This compound inhibits glycolysis, and can mimic some of the physiological effects of CR, in particular increased insulin sensitivity, reduced glucose levels, reduced body temperature, and other biochemical changes. It was reported to extend the lives of &quot;C. elegans&quot; worms; however, studies in different strains of rats found that 2DG did not extend lifespan at several tested doses, and exhibited toxic effects. &quot;Histopathological analysis of the hearts revealed increasing vacuolarization of cardiac myocytes with dose, and tissue staining revealed the vacuoles were free of both glycogen and lipid.&quot;
* It has been suggested that rapamycin, a drug that inhibits the mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, might be a CR mimetic. based on the responsiveness of mTORC1 activity to nutrient availability; the fact that mTOR activity is inhibited by CR; the fact that genetically inhibiting mTOR signaling extends maximum lifespan in invertebrate animals, and pharmacologically inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin extends maximum lifespan in both invertebrates and mice. While knocking out elements of the mTOR cascade seems to block the lifespan effects of rapamycin in invertebrate animals, surprisingly the effects of CR and rapamycin on metabolism and gene expression exhibit substantial differences in mice, with evidence suggesting that the mechanisms of the two anti-aging therapies may be in large part distinct and possibly additive.

Other candidate CRM are:
* Glucosamine or its derivative n-acetylglucosamine have extended the life of both nematodes and mice.
* Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma inhibitors, such as Rosiglitazone and Gugulipids, working as insulin sensitizers, making fat cells more responsive to insulin by binding to their PPAR receptors
* Agents that modulate sirtuins (called STAC –sirtuin-activating compounds), for example, fisetin
* Exanadin (exenatide), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)modulator (originally discovered in the venom of the Gila monster) belongs to the group of incretin mimetics, facilitating glucose control.
* Adiponectin (together with leptin, it regulates adipose tissue metabolism. It is activated by PPAR inhibitors such as rosiglitazone)
* Acipimox
* Hydroxycitrate
* Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors
* Iodoacetate
* Mannoheptulose (glycolytic inhibitor)
* Modulators of neuropeptide Y (NPY)
* 4-Phenylbutyrate (PBA)
* Gymnemoside (modulates glucose absorption)
* Spermidine

<text>A footjob is a non-penetrative sexual practice with the feet that involves one&#x27;s feet being rubbed on a partner in order to induce sexual excitement, stimulation or orgasm. It can involve using one or both feet, or the toes in a massaging motion. In some cases it can be part of a foot fetish. Footjobs are most often performed on penises, with one partner using their foot or toes to stroke or rub the other partner&#x27;s genital area. The term &quot;footjob&quot; may also refer to the practice of using one&#x27;s foot or toes to caress a partner&#x27;s vulva or anus.

==Popular culture==

* On an episode of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) seduces John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe) by rubbing her feet against his crotch under a restaurant table.
* In the 1975 film &quot;The Beast&quot; (&quot;La Bête&quot;), Romilde de l&#x27;Esperance (played by Sirpa Lane) is chased by a werewolf-like creature, who receives sexual satisfaction from de l&#x27;Esperance by receiving a footjob from her (as well as other things) as she hangs on the branch of a tree.
* The 2004 British movie &quot;9 Songs&quot; features a prominent footjob in a bathtub scene between lovers Matthew (Kieran O&#x27;Brien) and Lisa (Margo Stilley).
* In episode eight of series two of the British drama &quot;Mile High&quot;, Eloise (Nichola Theobald) rubs her foot against Captain Nigel Croker&#x27;s (Christopher Villiers) crotch to seduce him into giving her money.
*In the film &quot;Rabbit Without Ears 2&quot;, Marie (Edita Malovčić) seduces Ludo (Til Schweiger) by rubbing her foot against his crotch.

<text>Kaohsiung International Airport () is a medium-sized international airport in Siaogang District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, also known as Siaogang Airport (). With 4.2 million passengers in 2023, it was the third busiest airport in Taiwan, after Taoyuan and Songshan. The airport has a single east–west runway and two terminals: one international and one domestic.

==History==
===Early years===
Originally built as an Imperial Japanese Army Air Squadron base in 1942 during the Japanese rule era of Taiwan, Kaohsiung Airport retained its military purpose when the Republic of China government first took control of Taiwan in 1945. Due to the need for civil transportation in southern Taiwan, it was demilitarised and converted into a domestic civil airport in 1965, and further upgraded to the status an international airport in 1969, with regular international flights starting in 1972.

During the 1970s and 1980s, direct international flights were rare at the airport, with Hong Kong and Tokyo being the only two destinations. Since the early 1990s, dedicated connection flights to Taipei were inaugurated, bringing convenience to the south as Taipei had more international flights. These contributed to a steady growth in airport passenger and flight movements. A new terminal dedicated to international flights was opened in 1997.

In summer 1998, EVA Air opened a direct flight between Kaohsiung and Los Angeles, but it was discontinued only after six months. Northwest Airlines operated the Kaohsiung–Osaka route from 1999 to 2001, and the Tokyo route from 2002 to 2003. These two routes were separately suspended due to the low load caused by the September 11 attacks and SARS outbreak. 

===Development since the 2000s===
After Taiwan High Speed Rail, the high speed rail line that runs between Taipei and Kaohsiung along Taiwan&#x27;s western plains, began operation in January 2007, Kaohsiung Airport suffered large reduction in passenger and flight movements. The convenience of Taiwan High Speed Rail and record-high costs of jet fuel were eating up most load factors to Taipei, causing the eventual cessation of flights between cities on Taiwan&#x27;s western plains. The last domestic flight between Taipei Songshan and Kaohsiung landed on 31 August 2012. The dedicated international connecting flight between Kaohsiung and Taoyuan stopped on 1 July 2017, after over thirty years of operation.

Since 2009, the number of passengers has been recovering due to the opening of regular scheduled cross-strait flights to China, as well as the rise of low cost carriers.

==Terminals==

Kaohsiung International Airport has two terminals – domestic and international. They are connected by a corridor.

The domestic terminal was built in 1965 when the facility was first opened as a civilian airport. Through the years, it has undergone small expansions and improvements, but jet bridges have never been added. (The domestic terminal primarily serves smaller planes that do not require jet bridges.) The current domestic terminal building also served international flights before the opening of the new international terminal. The international terminal opened in 1997 and all gates have jet bridges. It serves all international and cross-strait flights to China. The floor area for the international terminal is three times larger than the domestic one.

<text>Broderie perse (French for &quot;Persian embroidery&quot;) is a style of appliqué which uses printed motifs from one fabric to create a design on a background fabric. It was popular in the late 18th century and early 19th centuries. The technique could be considered an early form of puzzle piecing.

==Description==
Broderie perse can be done with any printed fabric on any ground, but it originally was worked with Chintz type fabrics, often imported from India. Chintz typically has clearly defined, separated motifs, which were cut out and invisibly applied onto the ground fabric. Using motifs from the expensive, highly-prized fabric was a way to make the patterned fabric last longer. The typical intention was to create a scene from the motifs, but the decoration could also be random. Because the scale of the different motifs was not always considered, there might be a naive appearance to Broderie perse. 

== Process ==
Designs are cut out, leaving a small, even amount of fabric around the outside of the design. This is turned under and the whole design was tacked onto the background fabric. Final stitching would be done with a slipstitch, herringbone, or decorative blanket stitch.

== Uses ==
The resulting fabric was often made into bedspreads, either unlined for summer or quilted for winter. They were typically saved for special occasions, such as guest beds.

== Examples ==
A noted example of Broderie perse is the central panel of the Rajah Quilt which was made by women as they were transported to Tasmania in 1841. The quilt was rediscovered in 1989 and is now in Australia.

<text>Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC (CBC) also known as ComBank is a licensed commercial bank in Sri Lanka and its ownership is private. It was incorporated as a public limited company and it is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. It is regarded as the largest private bank in Sri Lanka in terms of net worth and capital. The bank is currently the third largest bank in Sri Lanka in terms of total net assets and it lies behind only Bank of Ceylon and People&#x27;s Bank (both are state commercial banks). It is also the only private sector licensed bank in Sri Lanka to be designated as the higher-tier domestic systemically important bank according to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The bank currently operates a network of 268 branches and around 932 ATM machines across Sri Lanka.

It became the first Sri Lankan bank to be listed in among the top 1000 banks in the world according to &quot;The Banker&quot; when it achieved the feat for the first time in 2008. Commercial Bank has also been ranked among the top 1000 banks in the world for nearly 11 successive years from 2008 to 2021.

It is considered as one of the most systemically important banks in Sri Lanka. It is the largest lender to Sri Lanka&#x27;s Small and Medium Enterprise sector.

== History ==
The bank was originally formed in 1920 and carried banking practices under the name as Eastern Bank. The first branch of Eastern Bank Ltd. (EBL) was opened at Chatham Street in Fort. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Barclays Bank acquired the shares of the Eastern Bank. The Chartered Bank bought the shares of Eastern Bank from the Barclays Bank in 1957 but the Chartered Bank ran the Eastern Bank for the duration of only four years. On 25 June 1969, Commercial Bank Ceylon Ltd. was incorporated with Eastern Bank holding 40% of its equity. Veteran judge V. Manicavasagar served as the first chairman of Commercial Bank when he was appointed to the position in 1969.

The three pillars of the sustainability focus by the Commercial Bank are sustainable banking, responsible organization and community impact. The sustainability initiatives of Commercial Bank are monitored and guided by the cross-functional Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) which consists of key sustainability linked functional areas. The bank implemented and applied the Social and Environmental Risk Assessment System in Sri Lanka to screen lending projects which would pose zero harm to the environment. In 2015, the bank launched a new paperless green banking facility which further demonstrated the bank&#x27;s focus on prioritizing the green technology and sustainable development.

It became the first and only bank in Sri Lanka to have achieved 100% carbon neutrality status. Thus, the bank achieved carbon neutrality for the entirety of its operations encompassing all of its 268 branches along with the main head office. It is reported that the bank had financed Sri Lanka&#x27;s first financially viable wind power project and also the first ever commercial-scale solar power project in Sri Lanka.
