===Professional playing career===

Bowness spent the entire 1977–78 NHL season in the NHL with Detroit, scoring eight goals and 19 points in 61 games, helping the team reach the playoffs. In four playoff games with Detroit, Bowness was held off the scoresheet as the Red Wings lost to the Montreal Canadiens in the quarter-finals. He was set to return to the Red Wings for the 1978–79 season, however, on October 10, 1978, Detroit traded Bowness to the St. Louis Blues for cash.

Bowness spent most of the 1978–79 season in the CHL with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, appearing in 48 games with the team, scoring 25 goals and 53 points with Salt Lake. In ten playoff games with the Golden Eagles, Bowness had five goals and nine points. Bowness also appeared in 24 games with the St. Louis Blues, scoring a goal and four points with the club.

==Career statistics==
===Regular season and playoffs===
==Coaching career==
===Winnipeg Jets (original franchise)===
Bowness became the first head coach of the Winnipeg Jets&#x27; new AHL affiliate, the Sherbrooke Jets, in the 1982–83 AHL season, as a player-coach with the club. Sherbrooke had a tough season, finishing in last place in the North Division with a 22–54–4 record, earning 48 points. He stepped down as player-coach before the 1983–84, as he played one last season before retiring in the summer of 1984.

Bowness became an assistant coach of the Winnipeg Jets under head coach Barry Long in the 1984–85 season. Winnipeg had a successful season, going 43–27–10, earning 96 points, finishing second in the Smythe Division. In the playoffs, the Jets defeated the Calgary Flames before losing to the Edmonton Oilers in the Smythe Division final.

Bowness remained on the Jets coaching staff in the 1985–86 season, however, the club changed head coaches during the season, as Barry Long was replaced with John Ferguson late in the season. The Jets struggled to a 26–47–7 record, earning 59 points, but still good for third in the Smythe Division. In the season opener against the Calgary Flames, Bowness was once fined $500 and suspended for three games after punching Calgary forward Tim Hunter in the head during a brawl. Brian Hayward and Hunter had been involved in a scuffle which escalated to a full brawl after Hunter continued to attack Hayward. In the playoffs, the Jets were swept by the Flames in the first round.

In 1986–87, Winnipeg hired a new head coach, Dan Maloney, and retained Bowness as an assistant. The Jets rebounded from their poor season, going 40–32–8, earning 88 points, to finish in third place in the Smythe Division. In the playoffs, Winnipeg defeated the Flames in the opening round, however, they were swept by the Oilers in the Smythe Division final. After the season, Bowness became the first head coach of the Moncton Hawks for the 1987–88 season. Bowness led the expansion team to a 27–43–8–2 record, earning 64 points and a sixth-place finish in the North Division, failing to qualify for the playoffs.

He began the 1988–89 season with Moncton, leading the club to a 28–20–5 record in 53 games. Bowness was then promoted to the NHL, as the Winnipeg Jets fired Dan Maloney, and named Bowness as head coach.

Bowness coached his first NHL game on February 9, 1989, as the Jets lost to the New York Rangers 4–3 at Madison Square Garden. After a 0–3–1 start, Bowness earned his first NHL victory on February 17, 1989, defeating the New Jersey Devils 3–2 in overtime at the Winnipeg Arena. Bowness led the team to an 8–17–3 record to finish the 1988–89 season, as the Jets missed the playoffs. After the season, the Jets hired Bob Murdoch as their new head coach, and Bowness left the organization.

===Boston Bruins organization===
Bowness became the head coach of the Boston Bruins&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Maine Mariners, for the 1989–90 AHL season. In his first season with Maine, Bowness led the club to a 31–38–11 record, earning 73 points and a fifth-place finish as the club failed to qualify for the playoffs. He returned to the Mariners for a second season in 1990–91, as the Mariners improved to a 34–34–12 record, getting 80 points, however, Maine finished in fifth place yet again, and failed to make the playoffs.

Bowness returned to the NHL to become the head coach of the Bruins for the 1991–92 season. He coached his first game as a Bruin on October 3, 1991, defeating the New York Rangers 5–3 at the Boston Garden. Overall, the Bruins finished the season with a 36–32–12 record, earning 84 points and second place in the Adams Division. Bowness coached his first playoff game on April 19, 1992, losing 3–2 to the Buffalo Sabres. The Bruins eventually won the series in seven games, followed by a four-game sweep over the Montreal Canadiens to reach the Wales Conference finals. It was the Bruins&#x27; first four-game playoff sweep over the Canadiens. Boston was then swept by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who went on to win the Stanley Cup.

After just one season with the Bruins, Bowness was not brought back, as Boston replaced him with Brian Sutter. Bowness then took a job with the expansion Ottawa Senators, becoming that franchise&#x27;s first head coach.

===Ottawa Senators===
Bowness became the first head coach of the expansion Ottawa Senators when he was hired in 1992. On October 8, 1992, the Senators won the franchise&#x27;s first game, over the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens 5–3 at the Ottawa Civic Centre. With a lineup perilously thin on talent, wins for Bowness and the Senators were few and far between, and Ottawa finished with a league-worst 10–70–4 record, earning 24 points and a tie for last place in the overall NHL standings with the San Jose Sharks.

Bowness returned to the Senators for the 1993–94 season. Though Ottawa boasted a somewhat stronger lineup and improved its season total by 13 points, the team nonetheless finished in last place in the NHL with 37 points.

Under Bowness&#x27; leadership, the Senators continued to go through some growing pains but also steadily improved. In the team&#x27;s lockout-shortened third season, Ottawa finished with a 9–34–5 record in the shortened 48-game schedule, finishing in last place in the league for the third straight season.

Bowness began a fourth season with the Senators in 1995–96. After a promising start which saw Ottawa record a 6–5–0 record after 11 games, the club fell into an eight-game losing streak and fell to 6–13–0, and Bowness was relieved of his duties. He was replaced by Dave Allison, who ultimately won only two of 27 games and was fired mere weeks later.

===New York Islanders===
Bowness joined the New York Islanders as an associate coach for the 1996–97 under head coach Mike Milbury. After the Islanders got off to a rough 13–23–9 start, Milbury resigned and Bowness became the new head coach of the Islanders. On January 22, 1997, Bowness coached his first game with New York, leading the team to a huge 8–1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers. The Islanders went 16–18–3 under Bowness; however, they failed to reach the playoffs. Bowness returned as the Islanders&#x27; head coach for the 1997–98 season; however, the club struggled to a 22–32–9 record, and he was fired, as Mike Milbury replaced him behind the bench.

===Phoenix Coyotes===
Bowness joined the Phoenix Coyotes (the former Winnipeg Jets) coaching staff as an assistant under Bobby Francis for the 1999–2000 season. The Coyotes had a strong season, going 39–31–8–4, earning 90 points and third place in the Pacific Division, sixth in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the Coyotes lost in five games to the Colorado Avalanche in the first round. Despite finishing with a 35–27–17–3 record, earning 90 points, the Coyotes failed to reach the playoffs in the 2000–01, as Phoenix finished in ninth place in the Western Conference.

The Coyotes rebounded in the 2001–02, going 40–27–9–6 to earn 95 points and finish in sixth place in the Western Conference and reach the postseason. In the playoffs, the Coyotes lost in five games to the San Jose Sharks in the first round. After the season, the Coyotes&#x27; head coach Francis won the Jack Adams Award for Coach of the Year.

Phoenix struggled in the 2002–03 season, going 31–35–11–5, earning 78 points and 11th place in the Western Conference, well out of a playoff position. The club had another tough season in 2003–04, as the Coyotes had a 20–24–15–3 before the team fired Francis and named Bowness as interim head coach. Under Bowness, Phoenix continued to struggle, as they went 2–12–3–3, and finished well out of the postseason once again.

With the 2004–05 NHL lockout cancelling the season, Bowness returned to the club in 2005–06 as an assistant under new head coach Wayne Gretzky. The Coyotes missed the playoffs once again with a 38–39–5 record, earning 81 points. After the season, Bowness left the club.

===Vancouver Canucks===
Bowness joined the Vancouver Canucks as an assistant coach under Alain Vigneault for the 2006–07 season. In his first season with Vancouver, the team won the Northwest Division with a 49–26–7 record, earning 105 points and third in the Western Conference. In the 2007 playoffs, the Canucks defeated the sixth-seeded Dallas Stars in seven games in the first round, however, Vancouver lost in five games to the second-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Anaheim Ducks in the second round.
The Canucks struggled to a 39–33–10 record in 2007–08, earning 88 points, and an 11th-place finish in the Western Conference and out of the playoffs by three points. 

Vancouver rebounded in 2008–09, winning the Northwest Division for the second time in three seasons, going 45–27–10, recording 100 points and third place in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the Canucks swept the sixth-seeded St. Louis Blues in four games, but they lost to the fourth seeded Chicago Blackhawks in six games in the second round.

The 2009–10 was another very successful season for the Canucks, as the club once again won the Northwest Division with a 49–28–5 record, good for 103 points and third in the Western Conference. Vancouver defeated the sixth-seeded Los Angeles Kings in six games, but they lost to the second-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in six games in the second round for the second consecutive season.

The club had a record-breaking 2010–11 campaign, as the Canucks won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy with a 54–19–9 record, earning a club record 117 points. In the postseason, Vancouver defeated their rivals, the defending Stanley Cup champion and eighth-seeded Chicago Blackhawks in seven games, followed by winning a six-game series against the fifth-seeded Nashville Predators to make the Western Conference final for the first time since 1994. The Canucks easily defeated the second seeded San Jose Sharks in five games to clinch a berth in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals against the third-seeded Boston Bruins. In the finals for the first time since 1994, the Canucks built a 3–2 series lead but lost their last two games to lose the Stanley Cup in seven games, one win short from winning the Stanley Cup. 

In the 2011–12 season, the Canucks would win their second consecutive Presidents’ Trophy. Despite this, the Canucks would get defeated in five games in the first round of the 2012 playoffs by the eighth-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings.

On May 22, 2013, shortly after being swept in the first round of the playoffs by the sixth-seeded San Jose Sharks after finishing the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season as the third seed in the Western Conference, Bowness, head coach Vigneault, and assistant coach Newell Brown were all fired from their positions.

===Tampa Bay Lightning===
Bowness joined the Tampa Bay Lightning as an associate coach on June 3, 2013, joining first-year head coach Jon Cooper. His responsibilities included the team&#x27;s defense and penalty-killing, the same responsibilities he had the previous seven years in Vancouver. 

On February 7, 2015, Bowness coached in his 2000th game in the NHL. The Lightning went all the way to the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals but would fall to the Chicago Blackhawks in a close six game series.

The Lightning would go on another lengthy playoff run as they would lose in the Eastern Conference Finals in the 2016 playoffs in seven games to the Pittsburgh Penguins, one win short from back-to-back appearances in the Stanley Cup Finals.

On June 14, 2016, Bowness signed a multi-year extension with the Lightning. On February 10, 2017, Bowness coached his 2,165th NHL game in a 2–1 shootout loss to the Minnesota Wild, passing Scotty Bowman for the most games coached as a head and assistant combined. Due to injuries with certain players throughout the 2016–17 season, the Lightning would miss the 2017 playoffs by one point.

He was dismissed on May 31, 2018, after general manager Steve Yzerman called the defense &quot;not quite good enough&quot; during the 2017–18 regular season where the Lightning finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference and the 2018 playoffs which saw the Lightning reach the Eastern Conference Finals and losing in seven games to the second-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, one win short from the Stanley Cup Finals once more.

===Dallas Stars===
Bowness was hired by the Dallas Stars as an assistant coach on June 22, 2018. 

On December 10, 2019, he was named interim head coach of the Stars after Jim Montgomery was fired due to unprofessional conduct. At the time of his promotion, Bowness had a career record of 123–289–51 as a head coach. He led the Stars to the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to his former team, the Tampa Bay Lightning, in six games.

On October 29, 2020, he was named the Stars&#x27; 24th head coach in the franchise history. After a disappointing COVID-19-shortened 2020–21 campaign, Bowness guided the Stars back to the postseason in 2022 where they lost a close seven-game series to the Calgary Flames. 

Shortly after Dallas&#x27; elimination from the 2022, and with his contract set to expire, Bowness stepped away from his position on May 20, 2022.

===Winnipeg Jets and retirement===
On July 3, 2022, the modern Winnipeg Jets franchise named Bowness head coach, replacing Dave Lowry.

During the 2023–24 season, he spent time away from the team twice, first because of a seizure his wife experienced in October 2023, and then for a minor medical procedure of his own in March 2024. Associate coach Scott Arniel filled in for him on the bench. He is a finalist for the season&#x27;s Jack Adams Award for &quot;the NHL coach adjudged to have contributed the most to his team&#x27;s success.&quot;

Bowness announced his retirement on May 6, 2024, after the Jets were eliminated in the first round of the 2024 playoffs. He finished his coaching career with 2,726 games, the most in NHL history, and is also one of three head coaches (along with Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn) to work in NHL in five different decades.

Prior to European settlement, the area that is now Boon was utilized by the Hopewell as a site for building mounds and circles, as well as for farming several species of corn, bean and squash. The area was located along what is now known as the Old Indian Trail, which was used to connect the Cadillac area to the Traverse City area.

Boon was first settled as early as 1888 as a station on the Toledo, Ann Arbor, and Northern Michigan Railroad. The community was platted in 1889 and received its first office on December 19, 1899.

The community of Boon was listed as a newly-organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time.

<text>The Ford Bantam is a coupé utility/pickup (known in South African English as a &#x27;Bakkie&#x27;) produced in South Africa. Production of the Bantam spanned three generations, with the vehicle produced in South Africa for sale within the South African market.

== History ==

Introduced in South Africa in 1983, the Bantam enjoyed success both as a rugged compact commercial vehicle, and as a leisure-oriented private vehicle. It was discontinued in 2011 without immediate replacement.

== Background ==

Coupe utility pickups such as the Bantam are popular in South Africa as a more affordable, compact and fuel-efficient alternative to larger commercial pickups such as the Toyota Hilux, Nissan Navara and Ford&#x27;s own Ranger. Their compact size and ease of handling means they are viable not just as light- to medium-duty commercial vehicles, but also as everyday transport.

Pickups intended for heavy commercial use (in South Africa, the so-called &quot;one-tonner&quot; class) tend to be based around a steel ladder-frame chassis, with the cab and load box mounted separately. In this class, petrol-driven engines are generally between 2,000 cc and 4,000 cc in displacement, and diesel engines are generally between 2,000 cc and 3,200 cc. The vehicles are usually rated to carry loads of between .

By contrast, the shells of compact pickups such as the Bantam (known as &quot;half-tonners&quot;) are almost always of monocoque (unibody) configuration. This yields greater commonality of parts with the passenger cars they are based on, as well as easier assembly on a parallel production line. They generally have around 35% less tare mass than a typical &#x27;one-tonner&#x27;, their engines generally displace between 1,300 cc and 1,800 cc, and they are usually rated to carry loads of no more than .

=== First generation (1983-1990) ===

The first-generation Bantam was introduced in South Africa in 1983. It was intended to compete for market share that was, at the time, almost entirely monopolised by Nissan&#x27;s B140 1400 Bakkie (which had been derived from the B110 sedan), with the remainder accounted for by the recently released Volkswagen Caddy. The Bantam (named after a breed of fowl known for its small size and courageous, defiant nature) was based on the Mark III Ford Escort. It featured a South African-developed load box, tailgate, rear lights, rear quarter windows and leaf-sprung, dead-axle rear suspension.

Like the Escort on which it was based, the Bantam was initially available with 1,296 cc and 1,598 cc carburettor-fed versions of Ford&#x27;s compound valve-angle hemi (CVH) engine. Faced with criticism from the South African market regarding noise, vibration, harshness and unreasonably high fuel consumption, Ford South Africa opted to discontinue CVH engine installation. Subsequently, South African Escorts and Bantams were fitted with crossflow variants of the technically obsolete Kent engine.

The Bantam was initially produced at the Ford plant in Struandale, Port Elizabeth. Upon Ford&#x27;s apartheid-era divestment from South Africa, Bantam production was relocated to the Samcor plant in Silverton, Pretoria. The exterior tailgate panels on pre-divestment Bantams and Rustlers have &#x27;Ford&#x27; or &#x27;Mazda&#x27; script pressed into them, while post-divestment vehicles have &#x27;MMI&#x27; script.

Within the South African market, the Bantam was also available as the Mazda Rustler.

=== Second generation (1990-2001) ===

In 1990, the Escort-derived Bantam was replaced with a Mazda 323-derived model. To save on research and development costs, the new Bantam used a slightly modified version of the existing load box from the previous Bantam. Re-styling and finishing of the new vehicle were undertaken by Samcor&#x27;s in-house design studio. The new Bantam was the first South African-produced vehicle to be subjected to computer-modelled finite-element stress analysis, and also benefitted from accelerated durability testing conducted by the University of Pretoria. As before, the vehicle was also available as a Mazda Rustler.

323-derived Bantams and Rustlers were available in various trim levels, and with a choice of three different petrol engines: a 1,323 cc carburettor-fed Mazda B3 engine producing 50 kW, a 1,597 cc carburettor-fed Mazda B6 engine producing 60 kW, and a 1,597 cc fuel-injected variant of the B6 engine that produced 77 kW.

Luxury-specification 60 kW versions featuring cloth-covered bucket seats, a sports steering wheel and bodywork decals were also available. The Ford variant was badged the &quot;Explorer&quot;, while the Mazda variant was badged the &quot;Drifter&quot;.

=== Third generation (2002-2011) ===
The third-generation Bantam was launched in 2002, based on the fifth-generation Ford Fiesta. As with the Mazda 323-derived Bantam, the Fiesta-derived Bantam retained a modified version of the Bantam Mark I load box and rear suspension. Production continued at the Silverton plant. Though the Mazda 121 (a re-badged Ford Fiesta) was available in South Africa, demand was judged sufficiently low that a Mazda-rebadged Bantam was never produced.

==== Initial version (2002-2006) ====

The third-generation Bantam was initially made available with a choice of 1,297 cc and 1,597 cc Rocam (Roller Finger Camshaft) petrol engines, and a normally-aspirated 1,755 cc Endura-D diesel engine. Being a low-cost derivative of the multi-valve Zetec-SE that was intended for developing markets, the Brazilian-designed Rocam engine is of single overhead-cam configuration with two valves per cylinder.

Rocam-engined Bantams were available in four different trim levels, with bucket seats as standard equipment on all Bantams. Basic (fleet) versions featured austere interiors with vinyl seat trim, and no air conditioning, power steering or audio system. XL versions featured Jacquard cloth upholstery, 14-inch alloy wheels, four-speaker sound systems, full instrumentation, power steering and air conditioning. In addition to XL-level features, XLT versions featured electric windows, electrically-adjustable mirrors, front fog lights, colour-coded exterior mirrors and front bumper. In addition to XLT-level features, XLE versions featured colour-coded exterior door handles, white-faced race-style instrumentation, driver and passenger airbags, and pyrotechnic seat-belt tensioners.
Endura-D-engined Bantams were available in basic and XL trim levels.

==== First facelift (2006-2009) ====

In 2006, the Bantam underwent minor restyling as part of a mid-life upgrade. The instrumentation cluster was simplified, the double-filament headlights were replaced with headlights featuring separate bulbs for dipped and main beams, the rear lights and front fog lights were redesigned, and different alloy wheels were installed on XL, XLT and XLE versions. The diesel engine option was no longer available.

==== Second facelift (2009-2011) ====

In 2009, the Bantam received a second mid-life upgrade consisting of all-new bonnet, headlights, front bumper, rear lights, &#x27;liquid chrome&#x27; nomenclature, instrument cluster and interior trim. Rocam-engined versions also received catalytic convertors, this facelift would make it more in line with the Indian Ikon, which also bore the same front end after it was facelifted in 2008. To counter the challenge posed by more modern half-ton pickups with advanced turbodiesel engines (such as the Opel Corsa Utility), Ford South Africa also offered the 1,399 cc DuraTorq engine option.

In 2011, Ford South Africa ended production of the Bantam, focussing its marketing efforts on the larger and more expensive Ranger. In 2013, Ford USA followed suit, discontinuing imports of the Brazilian-made Courier. With no equivalent replacement available, Ford&#x27;s support for the half-ton coupe utility segment effectively ended.

==== Similarity to Ford Courier ====

Another coupe pickup was derived from the fifth-generation Fiesta, independently of the Bantam. The resulting vehicle, the Ford Courier, was designed and produced in Brazil, initially for the Brazilian domestic market.
Aft of the vehicle A-pillars, the Bantam and Courier share almost no common parts. Whereas the Bantam uses the shorter front doors of the Ford Ikon and 5-door Fiesta hatchback in conjunction with rear quarter windows, the Courier uses the longer front doors from the 3-door Fiesta hatchback, with no quarter windows. In addition, after the Bantam was facelifted in 2009, it and the Courier did not share a similar front end. Production of the Fiesta-based Courier ended in 2013.

== Future Developments ==

Following the discontinuation of the Fiesta-derived Bantam, Fiat South Africa&#x27;s withdrawal of the Palio-derived Strada and General Motors&#x27; disinvestment from the South African market (effectively ending production of the Spark-derived Chevrolet Utility), the Renault Logan-derived Nissan NP200 is the only remaining half-ton coupe utility on the South African market as of November 2024.

South Africa&#x27;s deteriorating economy, combined with the relative unaffordability of larger pickups such as the Toyota Hilux and Ford Ranger mean that demand for a Bantam replacement has never abated. Since the end of Bantam production, unconfirmed rumours have circulated regarding plans by Ford South Africa to replace the Bantam with a direct equivalent. As of 2024, no such vehicle has yet been produced.

Rumours continue to circulate that Ford USA may develop a replacement for the Brazilian Courier, possibly based on the next-generation Focus platform. If cleared for production, the new vehicle could be released by 2022. However, after the coronavirus pandemic, Ford stopped manufacturing in Brazil and switched to solely selling imported vehicles in Brazil.

<text>William Franklin Hardman Jr. (April 6, 1933 – December 6, 1990) was an American jazz trumpeter and flugelhornist who chiefly played hard bop. He was married to Roseline and they had a daughter Nadege.

== Career ==
Hardman was born and grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, and worked with local players including Bobby Few and Bob Cunningham; while in high school he appeared with Tadd Dameron, and after graduation he joined Tiny Bradshaw&#x27;s band. Hardman&#x27;s first recording was with Jackie McLean in 1956; he later played with Charles Mingus, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Horace Silver, and Lou Donaldson, and led a group with Junior Cook. Hardman also recorded as a leader: &quot;Saying Something&quot; on the Savoy label received critical acclaim in jazz circles, but was little known to the general public. He had three periods in as many decades with Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers; Hardman&#x27;s misfortune was not to be with the Messengers at the time of their popular Blue Note recordings. Blakey occasionally featured him playing several extended choruses unaccompanied.

He died in Paris, France, of a brain hemorrhage at the age of 57.

== Playing style and legacy ==
A crackling hard bop player with blazing technique, crisp articulations, and a no-frills sound, Hardman later incorporated into his sound the fuller, more extroverted romantic passion of a Clifford Brown – a direction he would take increasingly throughout the late-1960s and 1970s. He figures by and large among the top ranks of hardbop titans of the time, although he never managed a commercial breakthrough like many of his colleagues such as Donald Byrd, Freddie Hubbard and Lee Morgan.

<text>Edward Walter Olczyk Jr. (; born August 16, 1966) is an American former center in the National Hockey League for 16 seasons with the Chicago Blackhawks, Toronto Maple Leafs, Winnipeg Jets, New York Rangers, Los Angeles Kings, and Pittsburgh Penguins. He won the Stanley Cup with the Rangers in 1994. Olczyk was also the head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins from June 2003 to December 2005.

Olczyk moved into broadcasting in his post-playing career, and currently provides commentary for &quot;NHL on TNT&quot; and for Seattle Kraken games on the Kraken Hockey Network (KHN). He served as a television color commentator for &quot;NHL on NBC&quot; until its end in 2021, and maintains a relationship with NBC Sports as a handicapper and analyst for that network&#x27;s horse racing coverage.

Throughout his career as an NHL player, he played 1,031 NHL games and produced 342 goals and 452 assists for a total of 794 points. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame on February 22, 2013. During the 1989–90 season Olczyk scored a point in 18 consecutive games, which was the longest streak by an American-born player in NHL history. The record was tied by Phil Kessel and later broken by Patrick Kane.

== Playing career ==
=== Amateur career ===
As a youth, Olczyk played in the 1978 and 1979 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Chicago.

Olczyk grew up in Niles, Illinois and Palos Heights, Illinois and went to Brother Rice Catholic High School. He was a star on the Illinois midget AAA team (Team Illinois) that won the 1982 national title against a Detroit Compuware squad that featured future NHL stars Pat LaFontaine and Al Iafrate. He then moved to Canada to play for the Stratford Cullitons junior team before joining the 1984 U.S. Olympic hockey team.

=== Professional career ===
Olczyk was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. He scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game on October 11, 1984, versus the Detroit Red Wings in Chicago Stadium against Greg Stefan. From 1984 through 1987, Olczyk was a member of Chicago&#x27;s infamous &quot;Clydesdale Line&quot; with Troy Murray and Curt Fraser, the nickname coined by Chicago&#x27;s broadcaster Pat Foley, as each player weighed in at or around 200 pounds. He was traded several times during his career. In 1987, Olczyk was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs with Al Secord for Rick Vaive, Steve Thomas, and Bob McGill.

In the 1989–90 season, Olczyk recorded an 18-game point streak, setting the record for longest point streak by an American player (later tied by Phil Kessel), the record would stand until being passed by Patrick Kane in the 2015–16 season. The 18-game streak would remain a Toronto franchise record (tied with Darryl Sittler) until being surpassed in December 2022 by Mitch Marner.

He was traded again in 1990 to the Winnipeg Jets, with Mark Osborne for Dave Ellett and Paul Fenton.

In 1992, he was traded for the third time in his career, this time to the New York Rangers for Kris King and Tie Domi. Olczyk missed much of the 1993–94 season recovering from a thumb injury suffered in a game versus the Florida Panthers on January 3, 1994; he took part in one playoff game (conference final game 6) and on June 14, 1994, became Stanley Cup champion with the Rangers.

During the next season, he was traded back to the Winnipeg Jets for their fifth-round choice (who ended up being Alexei Vasiliev) in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. After signing as a free agent with the Los Angeles Kings in 1996, he did not finish the season with them before being traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Glen Murray. He finished his career in Chicago.

== Post-playing career ==
He returned to Pittsburgh to become the color commentator for the Penguins on FSN Pittsburgh, where he was given the nickname &quot;Edzo&quot; by current radio announcer and then co-announcer Mike Lange. In 2003, he moved from the booth to the bench and served as head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins from June 11, 2003, until December 15, 2005. Despite adding marquee free-agents, the Penguins started the season with a disappointing 8–17–6 record, leading to Olczyk&#x27;s dismissal on December 15.
Beginning with the 2006–07 NHL season, Olczyk was the color commentator for the Chicago Blackhawks television broadcasts, partnering play-by-play announcer Pat Foley. He also was the lead color commentator for &quot;NHL on NBC&quot;, and previously for the &quot;NHL on Versus&quot;; the latter later rebranded as NBCSN in 2012, for both the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey and 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, where he partnered with Mike Emrick and &quot;Inside-the-Glass&quot; reporter Pierre McGuire.

At the end of the 5–3 U.S. win over Canada at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, Olczyk described the game as being &quot;tremendously tremendous&quot; after U.S. forward Ryan Kesler scored an empty-netter. The audio of Olczyk saying &quot;This has been tremendously tremendous&quot; was an instant hit among hockey enthusiasts and was the subject of many spoofs online.

In February 2016, it was announced that Olczyk would be the recipient of the Ring Lardner Award, which was founded in 2002 by the Chicago Athletic Association and honors broadcasters and writers who &quot;exemplify the wit and warmth of Ring Lardner&#x27;s writing.&quot; On July 11, 2012, Olczyk became the 16th Blackhawks player elected into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. The Blackhawks honored &quot;Edzo&quot; for his induction in a pregame ceremony on February 22, 2013, at the United Center.

In 2009, Olczyk received an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Achievement for Individual Excellence On Camera: Programming,&quot; followed by a 2012 Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Achievement for Sports Programs - Sporting Event/Game - Live/Unedited Program/Special.&quot; He was also inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.

On April 8, 2010, Olczyk returned to Pittsburgh to join more than 50 former Pittsburgh Penguins players being honored in a pregame ceremony before the final regular season game at Civic Arena in Pittsburgh.

On December 30, 2010, it was announced that Foley and Olczyk signed a three-year extension to stay with the Blackhawks.

On May 5, 2014, EA Sports announced that &quot;Eddie O&quot; would provide color commentary for &quot;NHL 15&quot; alongside play-by-play announcer Mike Emrick and &quot;Inside-the-Glass&quot; reporter Ray Ferraro. The trio have provided commentary for five years until Ferraro became the new color commentator in &quot;NHL 20&quot;. From 2018 to 2020, &quot;Inside-the-Glass&quot; reporter Brian Boucher joined the lead duo for national games. After Emrick retired, at the end of the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals, on October 19, 2020, he was paired with Kenny Albert and John Forslund for most of the regular season but was paired with Albert for the playoffs and the Stanley Cup Finals.

Albert and Olczyk joined TNT after the Finals as their lead broadcast team while NBC studio analyst Keith Jones was later added to join the pair.

Olczyk also has an interest in Thoroughbred horse racing, appearing in advertisements for Xpressbet and serving as a guest commentator and handicapper for major horse racing events such as the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Oaks, Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes on NBC networks, and on WGN Sports coverage of the Arlington Million that is fed nationally. Despite his arrival at Turner for hockey, Olczyk&#x27;s deal will allow him to remain at NBC to cover handicap horse racing.

On July 18, 2022, Olczyk left the Blackhawks following a contract dispute to join the broadcasting team for the Seattle Kraken.

== Personal life ==
Olczyk and his wife, Diana, have three sons, all former hockey players, and one daughter. Nick played for the Colorado College Tigers and, in 2022, became a television studio analyst for the Seattle Kraken. Tom, who played hockey at Penn State, most recently played professionally for the Indy Fuel of the ECHL and the Rockford IceHogs of the AHL. Eddie III spent a season with the Bloomington Thunder of the SPHL, has been an assistant coach with the Bemidji State Beavers, and is an amateur scout for the Kraken. Olczyk&#x27;s daughter Zandra attended the University of Alabama.

Rick Olczyk, Eddie&#x27;s younger brother, is a former hockey player for Brown University and became an assistant general manager for the Kraken in 2019.

On August 8, 2017, Olczyk issued a statement through the Blackhawks to announce that he had been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer, having undergone a surgical procedure to remove the tumor. Due to his chemo treatments, he only called select games that season for the team and NHL on NBC. In March 2018, Olczyk announced that he was officially &quot;cancer-free.&quot;

In October 2019, Olczyk released his autobiography, &quot;Eddie Olczyk: Beating the Odds in Hockey and in Life&quot;, in which he shares details of his fight with stage 3 colon cancer.

<doc id="662066" wikidata="Q5506504" url="?curid=662066" title="Frumpy the Clown">
<text>Frumpy the Clown is a comic-strip written and illustrated by Judd Winick and appeared from 1996 to 1998. 

Although it only ran for two years and appeared only in 30 newspapers (the largest being the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;), it had a fair sized fan base.

The strip began when Brad Bragg, a 10-year-old kid, brought back a clown to live with his family. The parents were reluctant, but since the kids loved him, they decided to let him stay.

Frumpy is a far cry from a normal clown. Though he has the white face, green hair, red nose, huge feet and polka-dotted jumpsuit one might expect, he&#x27;s fairly grouchy, a chain-smoker, and twice divorced. He doesn&#x27;t enjoy being stereotyped as an entertainer, and doesn&#x27;t do magic tricks, balloon animals, or comedy bits. He does love children, however, and teaches elementary school in order to help kids grow up right in the modern world. In the summer, he works as a camp counselor.

Characters other than Frumpy include Mike and Mona Bragg, parents, and their kids Kim and Brad. The Bragg family was Jewish, setting them apart from the average generic comic strip family. This fact was not treated as a big deal, and was only an important plot point in one storyline. (See below) 

Other characters include Nana (Mike&#x27;s mother), Principal Carr (principal of Vanderbilt Elementary School, where Frumpy teaches), Lumus (Mike Braggs&#x27; cousin) and the Bragg family&#x27;s cat Frodo (although the cat was introduced in January 1997, her name wasn&#x27;t revealed until May 1998).

Although this strip is mostly comedy, it did have some serious moments. For example, in one storyline Nana was revealed a Holocaust survivor.

Unfortunately, the strip ran into controversy. Many parents complained that this strip was inappropriate and unsuitable. At the same time, the cartoonist became burnt out and grew tired of doing the strip.

The strip ended with a week-long storyline where the clown announced the family he&#x27;s moving out. The clown rode down the street on an elephant while the family gave him a teary good-bye.

<doc id="662079" wikidata="Q1758337" url="?curid=662079" title="Ron Wilson (ice hockey, born 1955)">
<text>Ronald Lawrence Wilson (born May 28, 1955) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey player and head coach. In his coaching career in the National Hockey League (NHL), he has coached the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Washington Capitals, San Jose Sharks and Toronto Maple Leafs. He also was head coach of the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team at the 1998 and 2010 Winter Olympics. Wilson holds dual citizenship of the United States and Canada.

==Personal life==
Wilson was born in Windsor, Ontario, and raised in Fort Erie, Ontario. He moved from Fort Erie to Riverside, Rhode Island, when he was 12 years old. As a result, Wilson holds dual citizenship of Canada and the United States, and has represented Team USA in both playing and coaching.

Both his father, Larry Wilson, and his uncle, Johnny Wilson, played for the Detroit Red Wings in the 1950s and later coached in the NHL.

Wilson and his wife Maureen have two daughters, Kristen and Lauren.

In December 2016, Wilson suffered a stroke and underwent rehabilitation.

==Playing career==

===Collegiate===
Wilson began playing with Providence College in 1973–74, where he led the Friars in scoring in his rookie season with 16 goals and 38 points in 26 games, helping the Friars reach the ECAC quarter-finals, where they were defeated by the Harvard Crimson, 9–3.

In the 1974–75 season, Wilson broke out offensively, scoring 26 goals and 87 points in 27 games, helping the Friars into the ECAC tournament for the second consecutive season. In the tournament, the Friars would lose in the quarter-finals to the Vermont Catamounts, 7–5.

Wilson had another solid season with the Friars in 1975–76, scoring 19 goals and 66 points in 28 games, though the team struggled and failed to ultimately qualify for the tournament.

In his final season at Providence, in 1976–77, Wilson&#x27;s offense declined, though he still put up solid numbers, scoring 17 goals and 59 points in 30 games to lead the team in scoring. Providence qualified for the tournament as the eighth seed, but lost to Clarkson 6–3 in the quarter-finals.

===Professional career===
Wilson was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the eighth round, 132nd overall, at the 1975 NHL Entry Draft. He was also drafted by the Houston Aeros in the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft, but opted to sign instead with the Maple Leafs and pursue an NHL career.

Wilson saw his first professional action in the 1976–77 season after his college hockey career was over, where he appeared in four games with the Dallas Black Hawks of the Central Hockey League (CHL), scoring a goal.

Wilson began the 1977–78 season with the Black Hawks, where in 67 games, he scored 31 goals and 69 points to lead the team in scoring. He earned a late-season promotion to the NHL and played in 13 games with the Maple Leafs, scoring two goals and three points. Wilson did not see any playing time in the post-season, however, as the Maple Leafs lost to the Montreal Canadiens in the third round of the playoffs.

He split the 1978–79 season between the New Brunswick Hawks of the American Hockey League (AHL), as in 31 games, Wilson had 11 goals and 32 points, and the Maple Leafs. In Toronto, Wilson played in 46 games, scoring five goals and 17 points. He appeared in three playoff games for Toronto, earning an assist, as the Leafs lost to the Montreal Canadiens in the quarter-finals.

Wilson spent the majority of the 1979–80 season in New Brunswick, where in 43 games, he scored 20 goals and 63 points to finish fourth in team scoring. He appeared in only five games with the Maple Leafs, earning two assists. Wilson skated for the Leafs in the post-season, where he scored a goal and three points in three games as Toronto was swept by the Minnesota North Stars in the first round. He returned to the Hawks for the Calder Cup playoffs, and in 14 games, Wilson had three goals and five points, as New Brunswick lost to the Hershey Bears in the final round.

Wilson signed with EHC Kloten of NDA in Switzerland for 1980–81, where in 38 games, Wilson scored 22 goals and 45 points.

After only one season with Kloten, Wilson signed with HC Davos for the 1981–82 season. In 38 games, Wilson scored 24 goals and 47 points, helping the team finish in second place.

In 1982–83, Wilson improved his offense to 32 goals and 64 points in 36 games, as Davos finished the first round of the season with a League-best 20–0–8 record, before slumping to a 3–2–5 record in the final round to finish the season in third place.

Wilson saw more improvement with his offense in 1983–84, scoring 33 goals and 72 points in 36 games, helping Davos win the championship.

In 38 games in the 1984–85, Wilson scored 39 goals and 101 points, leading the club to their second-straight Swiss championship.

Following his season with Davos, Wilson returned to the NHL and signed with the Minnesota North Stars for the remainder of the 1984–85 season. In 13 games, Wilson had four goals and 12 points, helping the club secure the fourth and final playoff position in the Norris Division. In nine playoff games, Wilson had a goal and seven points, as Minnesota swept the first place St. Louis Blues before losing to the Chicago Black Hawks in the division finals.

Wilson returned to HC Davos in Switzerland for the 1985–86 season after his late-season stint with the North Stars in 1984–85. In 27 games, Wilson scored 28 goals and 69 points, helping the club into the post-season. In five playoff games, Wilson had six goals and eight points, however, HC Davos lost to HC Lugano in the final round.

For the second consecutive season, Wilson joined the North Stars after his season with HC Davos, and finished 1985–86 with Minnesota, scoring a goal and four points in 11 games, helping the club finish in second place in the Norris Division. In the 1986 playoffs, Wilson had two goals and six points in five games, as Minnesota lost to the St. Louis Blues in the division semi-finals.

Wilson remained with the North Stars in 1986–87, as in a career-high 65 games, he had 12 goals and 41 points to finish second among North Stars defensemen in team scoring, however, the club struggled and failed to qualify for the post-season.

Wilson began the 1987–88 season with the North Stars, where in 24 games, he scored two goals and 14 points. He played in his last NHL game on December 16, 1987, earning an assist in a 4–2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. Shortly after the game, the North Stars released Wilson.

Following his release from Minnesota, Wilson rejoined HC Davos to finish the 1987–88 season in Switzerland. In 36 games, Wilson had eight goals and 32 points and in six playoff games, he had two goals and seven points, as HC Davos finished in fourth place.

After the season, Wilson announced his retirement as a player.

==Coaching career==

===Milwaukee Admirals (1989–1990)===
Wilson joined the Milwaukee Admirals of the International Hockey League (IHL) as an assistant coach, working under Head Coach Ron Lapointe. In his only season with the Admirals, the club finished with a 36–39–7 record, finishing in third place in the West Division. In the playoffs, the Admirals lost to the Salt Lake Golden Eagles in the first round.

===Vancouver Canucks (1990–1993)===
Wilson joined the Vancouver Canucks coaching staff as an assistant coach under Bob McCammon in the 1990–91 season. After the Canucks struggled to a 19–30–5 record, the club fired McCammon and replaced him with Pat Quinn. Wilson remained as an assistant, and under Quinn, the Canucks went 9–13–4 to sneak into the fourth and final playoff spot in the Smythe Division. In the 1991 post-season, the Canucks lost to the Los Angeles Kings in six games in the first round.

In 1991–92, Vancouver improved their point total by 31 points, as the team finished the year with a 42–26–12 record, finishing in first place in the Smythe Division. The heavily favoured Canucks managed to defeat the Winnipeg Jets in seven games before falling to the Edmonton Oilers in six games in the Smythe Division Finals.

Vancouver improved their point total once again in 1992–93, going 46–29–9, earning 101 points and their second consecutive Smythe Division title. In the 1993 playoffs, the Canucks defeated the Winnipeg Jets in the first round before losing to the Los Angeles Kings in the division finals.

After the season, Wilson left the Canucks and became the first head coach of the expansion team Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.

===Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (1993–1997)===
Wilson became the first head coach of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for the 1993–94 season. On October 8, 1993, his first game as an NHL head coach, Wilson and the Mighty Ducks lost to the Detroit Red Wings, 7–2. He won his first game on October 13, defeating the Edmonton Oilers 4–3. The team finished the season with 33–46–5 record for 71 points, falling short of the 1993 playoffs.

The Mighty Ducks continued to struggle in the following season, 1994–95, finishing 16–27–5 in the lockout-shortened season to post the poorest record in the Western Conference.

Anaheim made a big improvement in 1995–96, however, as the club went 35–39–8 record (78 points). Nonetheless, Wilson and the Mighty Ducks&#x27; efforts came just shy of qualifying for the 1996 playoffs, finishing one spot out of post-season contention, ninth, in the Conference. Despite accumulating the same point total as the eighth-placed Winnipeg Jets, they lost the tie-breaker separating the two, as they finished with one fewer win.

The Mighty Ducks continued their improvement in 1996–97 season, finishing with their first-ever winning record, 36–33–13, and qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in team history. In the post-season, Anaheim defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in seven games before being swept by the Detroit Red Wings in the second round. Despite team improvement, on May 20, 1997, the Mighty Ducks fired Wilson.

===Washington Capitals (1997–2002)===
On June 9, 1997, the Washington Capitals hired Wilson to become the head coach of the team, replacing Jim Schoenfeld after the club failed to reach the playoffs in 1996–97.

In his first season with the Capitals, Wilson led the team to a 40–30–12 record, a 17-point improvement over the previous season&#x27;s total, as Washington qualified for the 1998 playoffs. In the post-season, the fourth-seeded Capitals defeated the Boston Bruins in the first round, then the Ottawa Senators and Buffalo Sabres to reach the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, the first time the team reached the Finals in their 24 years of existence. In the Finals, however, the Capitals were swept in four games by the Detroit Red Wings, who won their second consecutive Stanley Cup.

Washington regressed in the subsequent 1998–99 season, going 31–45–6 record and finishing 12th in the Eastern Conference, well out of a playoff spot.

The Capitals, however, rebounded in 1999–2000, as they won the Southeast Division with a 44–24–12–2 record and finished in second place in the East. In the 2000 playoffs, the Capitals were upset by the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the first round.

The Capitals won their second consecutive Southeast Division title in 2000–01, going 41–27–10–4 and earning 96 points, solid enough for a third-place finish in the Eastern Conference. In the 2001 playoffs, however, the Capitals were once again upset by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who won the series in six games.

In the summer of 2001, the Capitals acquired superstar Jaromír Jágr from the Penguins and were thought to be a Stanley Cup contender for 2001–02. Despite the high-profile acquisition, the club struggled for much of the season, posting a 36–33–11–2 record and finishing in ninth place in the East, out of the 2002 playoffs. On May 10, 2002, the Capitals fired Wilson after their disappointing season.

===San Jose Sharks (2002–2008)===
On December 4, 2002, Wilson was hired by the San Jose Sharks, who had recently fired Darryl Sutter and had a 9–12–2–2 record at the time Wilson was hired. Under Wilson, the Sharks continued to struggle, however, going 19–25–7–6 and failing to make the 2003 playoffs.

In his first full season with San Jose, (2003–04), Wilson turned around the team, leading them to a 43–21–12–6 record for 104 points, a first-place finish in the Pacific Division and a second-place finish in the Western Conference. In the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Sharks defeated the St. Louis Blues and Colorado Avalanche to advance to the Western Conference Finals. Despite being favored to win the series, the Calgary Flames, buoyed by the play of newly acquired goaltender — and former Shark — Miikka Kiprusoff, upset San Jose in six games.

Wilson remained with the Sharks during the 2004–05 season, which was cancelled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout.

The Sharks remained a top team in 2005–06 when play resumed, as the club went 44–27–11 for 99 points. In mid-season, the Sharks were involved in a trade that brought Joe Thornton to the club from the Boston Bruins. In the 2006 playoffs, the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators in the first round before falling to the eighth-seeded Edmonton Oilers in the second round.

San Jose continued to improve in 2006–07, as the team won 50 games for the first time in club history, going 51–26–5 for 107 points and clinching another playoff berth. In the 2007 post-season, the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators for the second-straight season, but lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the second round. With his team&#x27;s loss to the Red Wings, Wilson became the first head coach in NHL history to lose to the same team while coaching three different teams (including Anaheim in 1997 and Washington in 1998).

The Sharks improved their point total again in 2007–08, as they went 49–23–10, earning 108 points and having the best record in the Pacific Division and claiming the second seed in the Western Conference. In the 2008 playoffs, the Sharks narrowly defeated the Calgary Flames in seven games before losing to the underdog Dallas Stars in six games in the second round. On May 12, 2008, the Sharks fired Wilson, as the club failed to meet management&#x27;s playoff aspirations.

===Toronto Maple Leafs (2008–2012)===
On June 10, 2008, the Toronto Maple Leafs hired Wilson to become the team&#x27;s head coach, replacing Paul Maurice. Upon his hiring, Toronto had not made the playoffs since 2003–04.

In Wilson&#x27;s first year with the Leafs, 2008–09, the club went 34–35–13, earning 81 points for last place in the Northeast Division and 12th in the Eastern Conference.

The Maple Leafs continued to struggle in 2009–10, finishing with a 30–38–14 record, earning 74 points and a last place finish in the Eastern Conference. Before season&#x27;s end, the Maple Leafs traded away their two first-round draft picks — and a second-rounder — to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Phil Kessel, also adding defenseman Dion Phaneuf from the Calgary Flames to the club midway through the season.

Toronto saw some improvement in 2010–11, as the Leafs finished with a record of 37–34–11 (85 points). Despite the improvement, the club failed to reach the 2011 playoffs, finishing in tenth place in the East.

In 2011–12, the final year of Wilson&#x27;s contract, the Maple Leafs shot off to a solid start to begin the season. On December 26, 2011, the team had an 18–13–4 record and were sitting in a playoff position. Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke then signed Wilson to a contract extension. Shortly after the contract extension, however, the Maple Leafs began to slump, as they would go 11–15–3 in their next 29 games to fall out of playoff contention. On March 2, 2012, the Maple Leafs fired Wilson, replacing him with Randy Carlyle, who had himself just recently been fired as head coach by the Anaheim Ducks. Toronto had a 29–28–7 record at the time of Wilson&#x27;s termination.

===International career===
Wilson first coached internationally at the 1996 IIHF World Championship in Vienna, where he guided the United States to a bronze medal, the country&#x27;s first medal at the tournament in 34 years. Later that year, he was named the team&#x27;s coach at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where he led the Americans to the tournament championship.

Following this success, Wilson again coached the Americans at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, where they went a disappointing 1–3, defeating only Belarus and being eliminated by the Czech Republic in the quarter-finals.

In April 2009, Wilson was named the head coach for the U.S. Olympic hockey team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The team went undefeated through round robin play and advanced through the knockout stages, eventually losing to the hosts Canada in the final in overtime; the team won the silver medal.

On June 4, 2015, USA Hockey announced that Wilson would be the head coach for the men&#x27;s under-20 team at the 2016 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Helsinki, Finland.

===Coaching style===
As a coach, Wilson is well known for integrating technology into his coaching plans. During his stint with the Washington Capitals, he and assistant coach Tim Hunter introduced personal computers into the team&#x27;s strategy planning and burned DVDs of Capitals games for the team to review. In his stint with the San Jose Sharks, Wilson introduced a tablet computer to be used in the team bench by himself or his assistants to instantly plan out strategies and review plays.

==Broadcasting career==
In early 2015, Wilson joined the TSN Hockey panel as an analyst.

<text>St. Elmo Sylvester Hope (June 27, 1923 – May 19, 1967) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger, chiefly in the bebop and hard bop genres. He grew up playing and listening to jazz and classical music with Bud Powell, and both were close friends of another influential pianist, Thelonious Monk.

Hope survived being shot by police as a youth to become a New York-based musician who recorded with several emerging stars in the early to mid-1950s, including trumpeter Clifford Brown, and saxophonists John Coltrane, Lou Donaldson, Jackie McLean, and Sonny Rollins. A long-term heroin user, Hope had his license to perform in New York&#x27;s clubs withdrawn after a drug conviction, so he moved to Los Angeles in 1957. He was not happy during his four years on the West Coast, but had some successful collaborations there, including with saxophonist Harold Land.

More recordings as leader ensued following Hope&#x27;s return to New York, but they did little to gain him more public or critical attention. Further drug and health problems reduced the frequency of his public performances, which ended a year before his death, at the age of 43. He remains little known, despite, or because of, the individuality of his playing and composing, which were complex and stressed subtlety and variation rather than the virtuosity predominant in bebop.

==Early life==
Elmo Hope was born on June 27, 1923, in New York City. His parents, Simon and Gertrude Hope, were immigrants from the Caribbean, and had several children. Elmo began playing the piano aged seven. He had classical music lessons as a child, and won solo piano recital contests from 1938. Fellow pianist Bud Powell was a childhood friend; together, they played and listened to jazz and classical music. Hope attended Benjamin Franklin High School, which was known for its music program. He developed an excellent understanding of harmony, and composed jazz and classical pieces at school.

At the age of 17, Hope was shot by a New York policeman. He was taken to Sydenham Hospital, where doctors reported that the bullet had narrowly missed his spine. Six weeks later, after Hope had been released from the hospital, he appeared in court, charged with &quot;assault, attempted robbery and violation of the Sullivan Law&quot;. The police officers involved testified in court that Hope had been part of a group of five involved in a mugging. None of the other four, or any of the three alleged white victims, was identified by police; Hope stated that he had been running away with other passers-by after police started shooting, and was hit while trying to enter a hallway. The judge dismissed the charges against Hope, after which Hope&#x27;s attorney described the shooting as an &quot;outrage&quot;, and the charges as &quot;an attempted frameup&quot;.

Hope&#x27;s recovery was slow, and he did not go back to school. Instead, he played the piano in an assortment of taxi dance halls and other establishments in the city. Hope and Powell met fellow pianist Thelonious Monk in 1942, and the three young men spent much time together. This was interrupted in March 1943, when Hope enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army. In the enlistment records, Hope was listed as being single, with dependents. He had been married and had a son, who died. The terms of enlistment stated that Hope would be in the army &quot;for the duration of the War [World War II] or other emergency, plus six months&quot;.

==Later life and career==

===In New York – 1947–56===
Hope&#x27;s absence from the early bebop scene largely continued after he left the army, as he played principally in rhythm and blues bands for a few years. He was part of an octet led by trumpeter Eddie Robinson late in 1947, and played briefly with Snub Mosley around the same time. Hope had his first long-term association, with the Joe Morris band, from 1948 to 1951, including for several recordings. This band toured all over the United States.

Some of those Hope met in Morris&#x27; band were also interested in jazz. One, saxophonist Johnny Griffin, recalled a group of musicians, including Hope, who practiced and learned together in New York in the days of late-1940s bebop: &quot;We&#x27;d go to Monk&#x27;s house in Harlem or to Elmo&#x27;s house in the Bronx, we just did a lot of playing. I played piano a bit, too, so I could hear what they were all doing harmonically. But if something stumped me, I&#x27;d ask and Elmo would spell out harmonies. We&#x27;d play Dizzy [Gillespie]&#x27;s tunes or Charlie Parker&#x27;s.&quot;

This interest had expanded by June 1953, when Hope recorded in New York as part of a quintet led by trumpeter Clifford Brown and alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson. Critic Marc Myers suggested that the six songs the band recorded were the first in a new form of jazz, &#x27;hard bop&#x27;, that became highly influential. That 1953 session also helped Hope gain exposure with Blue Note Records&#x27; producer Alfred Lion, who supervised his debut recording as a leader around a week later. This resulted in the 10-inch album &quot;Elmo Hope Trio&quot;, which had Morris alumni Percy Heath on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums. The tracks recorded illustrated, according to critic Kenny Mathieson in 2012, that Hope was interested in the architecture and aural detail of the music more than in individual virtuosity. A further Blue Note recording session 11 months later led to &quot;Elmo Hope Quintet, Volume 2&quot;.

In August 1954, Hope was pianist for a Prestige Records session led by saxophonist Sonny Rollins, which was released as &quot;Moving Out&quot;, and for another session with Donaldson. Hope signed to Prestige in 1955, and recorded the trio album &quot;Meditations&quot; for them that year. This was followed by the sextet &quot;Informal Jazz&quot; the following year, with Donald Byrd (trumpet), John Coltrane and Hank Mobley (tenor saxophones), Paul Chambers (bass), and Jones (drums). Some commentators have suggested that sessions such as this and the ones with Brown and Rollins were a hindrance to Hope&#x27;s career: &quot;He too often recorded with young, rising overshadowing talents&quot; wrote a &quot;Buffalo Jazz Report&quot; reviewer in 1976.

In January 1956, Hope recorded with another rising star, Jackie McLean, for the saxophonist&#x27;s &quot;Lights Out!&quot;, again for Prestige. In April of the same year, Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons&#x27; &quot;The Happy Blues&quot;, but he left the record company&#x27;s building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that he had gone to visit an aunt in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His drug problem and associated criminal record led to the withdrawal of Hope&#x27;s New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play in clubs in the city.

===In Los Angeles – 1957–61===
Unable to earn a living in New York because of the performance ban, Hope toured with trumpeter Chet Baker in 1957 and then began living in Los Angeles. He soon found other musicians who had been influenced by bebop, including saxophonist Harold Land and bassist Curtis Counce. Hope played with Rollins again, and, in October 1957, recorded a session known as &quot;The Elmo Hope Quintet Featuring Harold Land&quot; which Pacific Jazz did not release until 1962, along with the contents of a . In March of the following year, Hope became part of Counce&#x27;s band, and went on to record two albums with the bassist. Hope also did some arranging for others around this time, including for Land&#x27;s 1958 &quot;Harold in the Land of Jazz&quot;. Hope also had his own band, with personnel that varied, and in 1959 he played with Lionel Hampton in Hollywood. Later that year, after performances in San Francisco with two quartets – the first containing Rollins, bassist Scott LaFaro, and drummer Lenny McBrowne; the other with Rollins replaced by Land – Hope travelled north with the Land group to play at a venue in Vancouver.

Back in Los Angeles in August 1959, Hope was pianist for Land&#x27;s quintet album &quot;The Fox&quot;; he also wrote four of the album&#x27;s compositions. This recording, along with &quot;Elmo Hope Trio&quot; from the same year, were, in the opinion of jazz historian David Rosenthal, illustrative of Hope&#x27;s musical development on the West Coast. The trio album received a rare five-star review from &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine, with the comment that Hope&#x27;s aesthetic was &quot;a sort of bitter-sweet melancholy that seems to lie at the core of other jazzmen [...] who sometimes find the world &#x27;a bit much&#x27;, as the English say, to cope with.&quot;

In 1960, Hope married the pianist Bertha Rosemond (better known as Bertha Hope), whom he met in California. As a jazz musician on the West Coast, Hope found his life frustrating. In his only major published interview (written up for &quot;Down Beat&quot; in January 1961 and entitled &quot;Bitter Hope&quot;), he criticized the lack of creativity in the then-popular church-influenced soul jazz, complained about the shortage of good musicians in Los Angeles, and lamented the lack of work opportunities in the few jazz clubs in the area. Hope left Los Angeles later in 1961. His wife recounted that he was no longer working with Land, had recording offers from companies based on the East Coast, and still preferred it to Los Angeles, so the couple and their baby daughter moved to New York.

===Back in New York – 1961–67===
In June 1961, Hope was part of Philly Joe Jones&#x27; quintet, which included trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. Their first gigs were arranged by Hope&#x27;s old friend, Monk, as was a recording session for Riverside Records that month, with Hope as leader. The pianist recorded four albums in New York around 1961, including &quot;Hope-Full&quot;, which contained his only solo tracks and some piano duets with his wife.

Some of the companies that he recorded for at this stage in his career reduced Hope&#x27;s dignity, in the view of musician and critic Robert Palmer. One album was entitled &quot;High Hope!&quot; (1961), and another, released as &quot;Sounds from Rikers Island&quot; (1963) in reference to a New York City jail complex, featured performances exclusively by musicians who had at some point been imprisoned for drug-related crimes. Between these two sessions as leader, Hope was briefly in prison again for drug offenses. These and other album releases in the early 1960s did little to develop a wider awareness of Hope.

Hope played with McLean again late in 1962. He also led a piano trio: early in 1963 it contained Ray Kenney on bass and Lex Humphries on drums; in late 1964, it had John Ore on bass and Billy Higgins on drums. In 1965, Hope was continuing to lead a trio and quartet in the New York area. Drug and health problems, however, meant that he played less often late in his career. His last recordings were made in 1966, but not released for 11 years. Hope&#x27;s final concert was at Judson Hall in New York City in 1966. Fellow pianist Horace Tapscott reported that, later, Hope&#x27;s &quot;hands were all shot up and he couldn&#x27;t play&quot;.

Visits to one hospital that was experienced in addressing the health problems of drug addicts left Hope feeling that he was being experimented on, so he went to another, St. Clare&#x27;s. Here, according to his wife, the treatment was not adjusted for the methadone program he was on, putting added strain on his heart. Hope was hospitalized with pneumonia in 1967 and died a few weeks later, on May 19, of heart failure. His wife was aged 31 at the time of his death. They had three children; their daughter, Monica Hope, became a singer.

==Artistry==
Hope&#x27;s playing was strongly based in the blues-influenced jazz tradition. He employed dissonant harmonies and spiky, contrasting lines and phrases. Rosenthal observed that Hope&#x27;s playing on one of his compositions for the 1953 Donaldson–Brown recording illustrated &quot;many elements of the pianist&#x27;s emerging style: somber, internally shifting chords in the introduction; punchy, twisting phrases in the solo; and the smoldering intensity that always characterized his best work.&quot; Hope&#x27;s sense of time meant that his note placement was unpredictable, falling at various points either side of the beat but not exactly on it. His use of keyboard dynamics was similarly flexible, as the listener could not predict when in a performance the level would change. The &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer of Hope&#x27;s final recordings, as reissued in 1996, wrote that &quot;he&#x27;s dynamically smoother than Monk, with a spidery, spacy touch. His harmonic and compositional approach is intricate in design and almost eerie in execution.&quot; &quot;Coda&quot; critic Stuart Broomer also commented on Hope&#x27;s touch, suggesting that it was unusual and light, and created a combination of delicacy and boldness that was all his own. Leonard Feather and Ira Gitler summarized Hope&#x27;s abilities: he had &quot;a style that parallels Powell, [...and] was a pianist and composer of rare harmonic acuity and very personal interpretation.&quot;

==Compositions==
The &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Jazz&quot; states that Hope composed around 75 pieces of music, which &quot;range in character from a tortuous nervousness to an introspective, semi-lyrical romanticism.&quot; One example, &quot;Minor Bertha&quot;, has an unusual 35-bar AABA form, with a nine-bar A-section that &quot;utilizes unconventional rhythms and weakly functional harmonies which obscure its phrases. Such other pieces as &#x27;One Down&#x27;, &#x27;Barfly&#x27;, and &#x27;Tranquility&#x27; [...] also offer fine examples of his idiosyncratic creativity.&quot;

&quot;The Penguin Jazz Guide&quot; commented that Hope&#x27;s compositions were strongly melodic, with some containing concepts of fugue and canon taken from classical music, but retaining foundations in the blues. Atkins stated that Hope wrote highly structured, complex compositions that he played with improvisational flexibility. Mathieson pointed out that, despite the originality of Hope&#x27;s compositions, they have been taken up by other musicians only rarely, as they are tied to Hope&#x27;s idiosyncratic form of expression and remain difficult to play.

==Legacy and influence==
Hope, Powell, and Monk were considered by their contemporaries to be influences on each other early in their careers, and all, therefore, helped affect the development of jazz piano. Powell was known for horn-like right-hand playing supported by simple left-hand chords, which was something he had worked on with Hope. Later pianists who have cited Hope as a major influence include Lafayette Gilchrist, Alexander Hawkins, Frank Hewitt, and Hasaan Ibn Ali. Hawkins said in 2013 that Hope was important because he had a highly individual style but does not have the iconic status of pianists such as Monk. Modern jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel has mentioned Hope&#x27;s rhythms, phrasing, and compositions as influences.

Bertha Hope has released albums dedicated to her former husband&#x27;s compositions. She and her later husband, bassist Walter Booker, created a band named &quot;Elmollenium&quot; in 1999, which played Elmo&#x27;s compositions. She transcribed recordings to recreate his arrangements, following an apartment fire that destroyed most of the original manuscripts. In September 2016, Lyman Place in the Bronx was co-named &quot;Elmo Hope Way – Jazz Pioneer&quot; in honor of the pianist.

Several critics have advocated for a reassessment of Hope&#x27;s career. One is Chuck Berg, writing for &quot;Down Beat&quot; in 1980, who attributed the ignoring of Hope by most jazz fans and critics largely to the uniqueness of his style, which differed from that prevalent in jazz generally and in bebop in particular. Berg contrasted the &quot;aggressive assertiveness, massive outpourings of raw energy and displays of technical athleticism&quot; that, he argued, are valued in jazz, with Hope&#x27;s more nuanced and intellectual approach, and suggested that the expansion of what is accepted in jazz since his death meant that his career should be re-evaluated. Seven years later, Palmer wrote on Hope and fellow pianist Herbie Nichols: &quot;they were practically categorized out of existence. Dismissed as second-stringers and copyists when they were both prolifically creative and highly original, they suffered a neglect that is only now beginning to be dispelled in the case of Nichols, and that still continues in the case of Hope.&quot; In 2010, &quot;The Penguin Jazz Guide&quot; observed that, &quot;Like many of his piano generation, [... Hope&#x27;s] work is only now being properly studied and appreciated.&quot;

Pianist Hasaan Ibn Ali said of Hope, &quot;He was one of the foremost great ones to offer such a large dose for the sickness of music. And upon his ideals, and knowing help was needed, he gave to companions Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell and many others... [D]uring this time, so much being produced, so much being brought forth by the musicians, still he being the actual cause.&quot; Tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin called Hope &quot;the real genius of the piano.&quot;

<text>The Ford Ikon is a subcompact car produced by Ford since the end of 1999. It was initially introduced as the sedan version of the Ford Fiesta hatchback car. It spawned over two generations, the first being based on the fourth generation of the Ford Fiesta and bearing a similar front end design.

The second generation was derived from the fifth generation of the Ford Fiesta into two different sedan models, produced in India and in Brazil, but the Ford Ikon nameplate has only been used for these in South Africa and Mexico, respectively.

Also in Mexico, the nameplate is used for a redesigned hatchback version of the fifth generation of the Ford Fiesta, the Ford Figo, which is imported from India.
==First generation (1999–2011)==

The first generation of the Ford Ikon was launched in November 1999, in the Indian capital of New Delhi. It was based on the fourth generation of the Ford Fiesta hatchback, being the four-door sedan version of the latter. Reportedly, it was designed specifically for the Indian market, after the company&#x27;s officials recognised that a more tailored car could be more successful than the global models in that market. It has been produced at Ford&#x27;s factory located in Chennai.

It was also marketed in South America and China, where it was known as the Ford Fiesta Sedan. At the beginning of 2001, it also began assembly in South Africa and Mexico. In China, it was assembled starting from 2003, at the Changan Ford factory. In this market, it featured a four-speed automatic transmission, as well as other features such as ABS with electronic brake force distribution, CD player and changer, electric mirrors, remote central locking, antitheft alarm, and front airbags.

It was powered by a 1.3-litre petrol engine, with a single overhead camshaft and electronic fuel injection that was capable of generating .

Additional 1.6-litre petrol, and 1.8-litre diesel variants were launched at the end of 2002 and during 2003, respectively.

The better-equipped version Flair featured power steering, electric windows, air conditioning, central locking, tachometer, side-impact beams, and new jeans blue color option.

A seven-seater Ikon Estate started development in late 1998, and a model was presented in March 1999. However, the packaging restrictions caused unfavourable proportions that the designers struggled to circumvent, and the project was cancelled soon after.

===Facelift===
In November 2008, it was facelifted and received a new diesel engine, from the Duratorq engine family, featuring common-rail injection. It complemented the 1.3-litre petrol unit, and was able to deliver and of torque.

Among the features of this model were a CD/MP3 player, redesigned seat covers, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, remote-controlled central locking, a new instrument cluster with LCD odometer display, and internally adjustable door mirrors. At the exterior, it featured new redesigned headlamps, clear taillamps, and no moldings on the doors. The boot had a capacity of .

It was retired from production in early 2011, following the launch of the sixth generation of the Ford Fiesta in India. The Ford Fiesta Classic (the fifth generation Fiesta in saloon form, sold in India since 2005) effectively took the place of the Ikon in the market.
==Second generation (2007–2015)==
The following fifth generation of the Ford Fiesta spawned into two models with a sedan body style, one in India and one in Brazil. They were both marketed under the Ford Fiesta nameplate in their countries of origin, but in some particular markets, they were exported as the new Ford Ikon (namely in South Africa and Mexico). Furthermore, a redesigned hatchback version of the same generation of the Ford Fiesta, produced in India and marketed as the Ford Figo, is also exported as the Ford Ikon in Mexico.

===India and South Africa===

In India, the new generation Ford Fiesta was launched in October 2005. This model was available only as a sedan and featured a different exterior design than the model released in Europe, but had a relatively similar interior.

This same model was released in South Africa as the new Ford Ikon in September 2007. It was powered by either a 1.4- or 1.6-litre petrol engine, both with double overhead camshaft and four valves per cylinder, or by a 1.4-litre common-rail turbodiesel engine. All three engines were coupled to a five-speed manual gearbox.

The car was facelifted in June 2008, the modification being adopted in South Africa in February 2009. It received a revised front end (pictured), new 15-inch alloy wheels, and new interior and trim specifications.

Its dimensions are: wheelbase, length, width, height. The boot capacity has been increased to .

===Brazil and Mexico===

In Brazil, the sedan version of the fifth-generation Ford Fiesta was introduced in September 2004, being also marketed throughout the rest of Latin America (including Mexico). This model featured the same front-end design as the model released in Europe. Unlike other countries, the Ikon was marketed in South America as the Fiesta Sedan. It was facelifted in January 2007, and again in April 2010.

This second facelift was introduced in Mexico as the new Ford Ikon during the same year. It was followed by a hatchback version, marketed as the Ikon Hatch, that was released one year later. The latter has a different front-end design from the sedan, and is imported from India, where it is known as the Ford Figo. It is also a redesigned version of the fifth generation of the Ford Fiesta. The sedan version was subsequently retired from the range in Mexico in February 2012.

The sedan model was powered by a 1.6-litre petrol engine with a single overhead camshaft, coupled to a five-speed manual transmission, that had a maximum power output of . The hatchback version has a 1.6-litre Duratec petrol engine with a double overhead camshaft, that develops a maximum power of .

Its dimensions are: wheelbase, length, width, height. The boot capacity is .

<text>Mathematical and theoretical biology, or biomathematics, is a branch of biology which employs theoretical analysis, mathematical models and abstractions of living organisms to investigate the principles that govern the structure, development and behavior of the systems, as opposed to experimental biology which deals with the conduction of experiments to test scientific theories. The field is sometimes called mathematical biology or biomathematics to stress the mathematical side, or theoretical biology to stress the biological side. Theoretical biology focuses more on the development of theoretical principles for biology while mathematical biology focuses on the use of mathematical tools to study biological systems, even though the two terms are sometimes interchanged.

Mathematical biology aims at the mathematical representation and modeling of biological processes, using techniques and tools of applied mathematics. It can be useful in both theoretical and practical research. Describing systems in a quantitative manner means their behavior can be better simulated, and hence properties can be predicted that might not be evident to the experimenter. This requires precise mathematical models.

Because of the complexity of the living systems, theoretical biology employs several fields of mathematics, and has contributed to the development of new techniques.

==History==
===Early history===
Mathematics has been used in biology as early as the 13th century, when Fibonacci used the famous Fibonacci series to describe a growing population of rabbits. In the 18th century, Daniel Bernoulli applied mathematics to describe the effect of smallpox on the human population. Thomas Malthus&#x27; 1789 essay on the growth of the human population was based on the concept of exponential growth. Pierre François Verhulst formulated the logistic growth model in 1836.

Fritz Müller described the evolutionary benefits of what is now called Müllerian mimicry in 1879, in an account notable for being the first use of a mathematical argument in evolutionary ecology to show how powerful the effect of natural selection would be, unless one includes Malthus&#x27;s discussion of the effects of population growth that influenced Charles Darwin: Malthus argued that growth would be exponential (he uses the word &quot;geometric&quot;) while resources (the environment&#x27;s carrying capacity) could only grow arithmetically.

The term &quot;theoretical biology&quot; was first used as a monograph title by Johannes Reinke in 1901, and soon after by Jakob von Uexküll in 1920. One founding text is considered to be On Growth and Form (1917) by D&#x27;Arcy Thompson, and other early pioneers include Ronald Fisher, Hans Leo Przibram, Vito Volterra, Nicolas Rashevsky and Conrad Hal Waddington.

===Recent growth===
Interest in the field has grown rapidly from the 1960s onwards. Some reasons for this include:
* The rapid growth of data-rich information sets, due to the genomics revolution, which are difficult to understand without the use of analytical tools
* Recent development of mathematical tools such as chaos theory to help understand complex, non-linear mechanisms in biology
* An increase in computing power, which facilitates calculations and simulations not previously possible
* An increasing interest in in silico experimentation due to ethical considerations, risk, unreliability and other complications involved in human and non-human animal research

==Areas of research==
Several areas of specialized research in mathematical and theoretical biology as well as external links to related projects in various universities are concisely presented in the following subsections, including also a large number of appropriate validating references from a list of several thousands of published authors contributing to this field. Many of the included examples are characterised by highly complex, nonlinear, and supercomplex mechanisms, as it is being increasingly recognised that the result of such interactions may only be understood through a combination of mathematical, logical, physical/chemical, molecular and computational models.

=== Abstract relational biology ===
Abstract relational biology (ARB) is concerned with the study of general, relational models of complex biological systems, usually abstracting out specific morphological, or anatomical, structures. Some of the simplest models in ARB are the Metabolic-Replication, or (M,R)--systems introduced by Robert Rosen in 1957–1958 as abstract, relational models of cellular and organismal organization.

Other approaches include the notion of autopoiesis developed by Maturana and Varela, Kauffman&#x27;s Work-Constraints cycles, and more recently the notion of closure of constraints.

===Algebraic biology===
Algebraic biology (also known as symbolic systems biology) applies the algebraic methods of symbolic computation to the study of biological problems, especially in genomics, proteomics, analysis of molecular structures and study of genes.

=== Complex systems biology ===
An elaboration of systems biology to understand the more complex life processes was developed since 1970 in connection with molecular set theory, relational biology and algebraic biology.

===Computer models and automata theory===
A monograph on this topic summarizes an extensive amount of published research in this area up to 1986, including subsections in the following areas: computer modeling in biology and medicine, arterial system models, neuron models, biochemical and oscillation s, quantum automata, quantum computers in molecular biology and genetics, cancer modelling, neural nets, genetic networks, abstract categories in relational biology, metabolic-replication systems, category theory applications in biology and medicine, automata theory, cellular automata, tessellation models and complete self-reproduction, chaotic systems in organisms, relational biology and organismic theories.

=== Computational neuroscience ===
Computational neuroscience (also known as theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience) is the theoretical study of the nervous system.

===Evolutionary biology===
Ecology and evolutionary biology have traditionally been the dominant fields of mathematical biology.

Evolutionary biology has been the subject of extensive mathematical theorizing. The traditional approach in this area, which includes complications from genetics, is population genetics. Most population geneticists consider the appearance of new alleles by mutation, the appearance of new genotypes by recombination, and changes in the frequencies of existing alleles and genotypes at a small number of gene loci. When infinitesimal effects at a large number of gene loci are considered, together with the assumption of linkage equilibrium or quasi-linkage equilibrium, one derives quantitative genetics. Ronald Fisher made fundamental advances in statistics, such as analysis of variance, via his work on quantitative genetics. Another important branch of population genetics that led to the extensive development of coalescent theory is phylogenetics. Phylogenetics is an area that deals with the reconstruction and analysis of phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees and networks based on inherited characteristics Traditional population genetic models deal with alleles and genotypes, and are frequently stochastic.

Many population genetics models assume that population sizes are constant. Variable population sizes, often in the absence of genetic variation, are treated by the field of population dynamics. Work in this area dates back to the 19th century, and even as far as 1798 when Thomas Malthus formulated the first principle of population dynamics, which later became known as the Malthusian growth model. The Lotka–Volterra predator-prey equations are another famous example. Population dynamics overlap with another active area of research in mathematical biology: mathematical epidemiology, the study of infectious disease affecting populations. Various models of the spread of infections have been proposed and analyzed, and provide important results that may be applied to health policy decisions.

In evolutionary game theory, developed first by John Maynard Smith and George R. Price, selection acts directly on inherited phenotypes, without genetic complications. This approach has been mathematically refined to produce the field of adaptive dynamics.

=== Mathematical biophysics ===
The earlier stages of mathematical biology were dominated by mathematical biophysics, described as the application of mathematics in biophysics, often involving specific physical/mathematical models of biosystems and their components or compartments.

The following is a list of mathematical descriptions and their assumptions.

====Deterministic processes (dynamical systems)====
A fixed mapping between an initial state and a final state. Starting from an initial condition and moving forward in time, a deterministic process always generates the same trajectory, and no two trajectories cross in state space.
* Difference equations/Maps – discrete time, continuous state space.
* Ordinary differential equations – continuous time, continuous state space, no spatial derivatives. &quot;See also:&quot; Numerical ordinary differential equations.
* Partial differential equations – continuous time, continuous state space, spatial derivatives. &quot;See also:&quot; Numerical partial differential equations.
* Logical deterministic cellular automata – discrete time, discrete state space. &quot;See also:&quot; Cellular automaton.

====Stochastic processes (random dynamical systems)====
A random mapping between an initial state and a final state, making the state of the system a random variable with a corresponding probability distribution.
* Non-Markovian processes – generalized master equation – continuous time with memory of past events, discrete state space, waiting times of events (or transitions between states) discretely occur.
* Jump Markov process – master equation – continuous time with no memory of past events, discrete state space, waiting times between events discretely occur and are exponentially distributed. &quot;See also:&quot; Monte Carlo method for numerical simulation methods, specifically dynamic Monte Carlo method and Gillespie algorithm.
* Continuous Markov process – stochastic differential equations or a Fokker–Planck equation – continuous time, continuous state space, events occur continuously according to a random Wiener process.

====Spatial modelling====
One classic work in this area is Alan Turing&#x27;s paper on morphogenesis entitled &quot;The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis&quot;, published in 1952 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
* Travelling waves in a wound-healing assay
* Swarming behaviour
* A mechanochemical theory of morphogenesis
* Biological pattern formation
* Spatial distribution modeling using plot samples
* Turing patterns

=== Mathematical methods ===
A model of a biological system is converted into a system of equations, although the word &#x27;model&#x27; is often used synonymously with the system of corresponding equations. The solution of the equations, by either analytical or numerical means, describes how the biological system behaves either over time or at equilibrium. There are many different types of equations and the type of behavior that can occur is dependent on both the model and the equations used. The model often makes assumptions about the system. The equations may also make assumptions about the nature of what may occur.

=== Molecular set theory ===
Molecular set theory is a mathematical formulation of the wide-sense chemical kinetics of biomolecular reactions in terms of sets of molecules and their chemical transformations represented by set-theoretical mappings between molecular sets. It was introduced by Anthony Bartholomay, and its applications were developed in mathematical biology and especially in mathematical medicine.
In a more general sense, Molecular set theory is the theory of molecular categories defined as categories of molecular sets and their chemical transformations represented as set-theoretical mappings of molecular sets. The theory has also contributed to biostatistics and the formulation of clinical biochemistry problems in mathematical formulations of pathological, biochemical changes of interest to Physiology, Clinical Biochemistry and Medicine.

===Organizational biology===
Theoretical approaches to biological organization aim to understand the interdependence between the parts of organisms. They emphasize the circularities that these interdependences lead to. Theoretical biologists developed several concepts to formalize this idea.

For example, abstract relational biology (ARB) is concerned with the study of general, relational models of complex biological systems, usually abstracting out specific morphological, or anatomical, structures. Some of the simplest models in ARB are the Metabolic-Replication, or (M,R)--systems introduced by Robert Rosen in 1957–1958 as abstract, relational models of cellular and organismal organization.

== Model example: the cell cycle ==

The eukaryotic cell cycle is very complex and has been the subject of intense study, since its misregulation leads to cancers.
It is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results. Two research groups have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model that can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006).

By means of a system of ordinary differential equations these models show the change in time (dynamical system) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a deterministic process (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a stochastic process).

To obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as rate kinetics for stoichiometric reactions, Michaelis-Menten kinetics for enzyme substrate reactions and Goldbeter–Koshland kinetics for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size.

To fit the parameters, the differential equations must be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis. In a simulation, given a starting vector (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments.

 In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending on the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a vector field, where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a stable point, called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an unstable point, either a source or a saddle point, which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate).

A better representation, which handles the large number of variables and parameters, is a bifurcation diagram using bifurcation theory. The presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event (Cell cycle checkpoint), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a Hopf bifurcation and an infinite period bifurcation.

<text>Joseph Lee Morris (March 2, 1922 – November 7, 1958) was an American jazz and rhythm and blues trumpeter.

==Biography==
Born in Montgomery, Alabama, United States, Morris began his career as a jazz trumpeter, working and recording with Earl Bostic, Milt Buckner, Arnett Cobb, Dizzy Gillespie, Johnny Griffin, Buddy Rich, Dinah Washington, Big Joe Turner, and Lionel Hampton.

After working with Hampton as a writer, arranger, and trumpeter, he left in 1946 to set up the Joe Morris Orchestra, which featured, among others, Johnny Griffin, George Freeman, Elmo Hope, Percy Heath, Philly Joe Jones, Long John Hobbs, and Hasaan Ibn Ali (then known as William Langford). One of his first credited recordings as bandleader was with Wynonie Harris on &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot;.

Morris signed with the then fledgling Boston Records, and released &quot;Anytime, Any Place, Anywhere&quot;, with vocals by Laurie Tate. This rose to number one on the U.S. R&amp;B chart in 1950, and he followed up with &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Your Love Away from Me&quot;. The band functioned as the unofficial house band for Atlantic Records in the early 1950s, and several future stars passed through its ranks, including Ray Charles and Lowell Fulson.

In 1953, Tate left for a solo career, and Morris replaced her with his new discovery, Faye Adams. He moved to Herald Records, where he backed Adams on her number-one R&amp;B hit, his own composition &quot;Shake a Hand&quot;, and its follow-up, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be True&quot;, also an R&amp;B number-one hit. At the same time, he had his own hit with &quot;I Had a Notion&quot;, featuring vocals by Al Savage.

Morris died in Phoenix, Arizona, of a cerebral haemorrhage in 1958, aged 36.

<text>Michael Elwin Kitchen (born February 1, 1956) is a Canadian former defenceman and coach. He most recently was an assistant coach for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League. As of February 2016, Kitch has coached in over 2400 NHL games including playoffs. In 2012/2013 he assisted in coaching the Hawks to their longest winning streak without a loss. He also spent time as the head coach of the Lake Simcoe Snappers, the Georgina Men’s League Champions.

He was selected in the third round of the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft, 38th overall, by the Kansas City Scouts. He was also taken in the seventh round of the 1976 WHA Amateur Draft, 83rd overall, by the Toronto Toros, although Kitchen ultimately chose to enter the NHL. Kitchen was born in Newmarket, Ontario, but grew up in Schomberg, Ontario.

Mike is well known for his charitable work and has used his day with the Stanley Cup to raise funds for Southlake Regional Health Centre and other local charities.

Kitchen is the older brother of Bill Kitchen, also a former hockey player.

==Playing career==
A defensive defenceman, Kitchen played his amateur career with the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association, winning a Memorial Cup in 1975. He turned professional for the 1976–77 NHL season, serving a brief, 14-game apprenticeship Rhode Island Reds of the AHL, before making his NHL debut. Kitchen joined the newly relocated Colorado Rockies in his first professional season, and spent his entire NHL career with the same franchise, becoming the only player to play for the Rockies in all six seasons of their existence. The team moved to New Jersey after the 1981–82 NHL season, and Kitchen went on to play two more seasons for the New Jersey Devils. Kitchen was sent to the Maine Mariners of the AHL for the entire 1984–85 NHL season, and decided to retire following that season&#x27;s conclusion.

==Coaching career==
Kitchen was hired as an assistant coach by the Newmarket Saints of the AHL for the 1988–89 season, and was subsequently hired for the same position by the Toronto Maple Leafs, where he spent eight seasons helping them to conference finals appearances in 1993 and 1994. He then left Toronto for the same position with the St. Louis Blues franchise, a position he held until his elevation to head coach halfway through the 2003–04 NHL season. The Blues struggled and were 9th place in the Western Conference when they fired Joel Quenneville and replaced him with Kitchen as head coach. However under Kitchen, they picked up their play and went 10–7–4 in the process to make the playoffs once again.

In the 2005–2006 NHL season, Mike Kitchen led a younger group of Blues to a 21–46–15 record. 2006–2007 started the same as the Blues stumbled out of the gate to a 7–17–4 mark. On December 11, 2006, after a seven-game losing streak, Kitchen was fired as head coach of the St. Louis Blues and replaced by former Los Angeles Kings head coach Andy Murray. Blues president John Davidson indicated that he would like Kitchen to remain with the organization in a different capacity.

At the end of that season, Kitchen left the Blues to become an assistant coach with the Florida Panthers in 2007. He stayed with the club through the 2009-2010 season. With that contract having expired, on July 12, 2010 Mike agreed to a contract with the Chicago Blackhawks which saw him reunited with head coach Joel Quenneville. Joel and Mike had coached together in St. Louis from 1998 - 2003, leading the Blues to a franchise record 114 points in 1999-2000 while winning the President’s Trophy.

The Hawks were fresh off their first Stanley Cup victory in 49 years. Since arriving, Kitchen helped the team win two more Stanley Cups, in 2012-2013 and in 2014-2015.

Kitchen was relieved of his duties with the Blackhawks, which focused on defense and the penalty kill, on April 24, 2017 following the team&#x27;s second consecutive first-round playoff exit, this time against the Nashville Predators after a 4-0 sweep.

In 2018, Kitchen joined Team Canada for the first time as an assistant coach. The team participated in the 92nd Spengler Cup, which was held from 26 to 31 December 2018 at the Vaillant Arena, Davos. Canada placed second in this tournament.

After being away from hockey for two seasons, Kitchen reunited once more with Joel Quenneville this time with the Florida Panthers again for the second time In his career as an assistant coach with the team, this time instead working under Quenneville’s watch for the upcoming 2019-20 NHL Season.

<doc id="662125" wikidata="Q762938" url="?curid=662125" title="Ford Corcel">
<text>The Ford Corcel (&quot;charger&quot; or &quot;steed&quot; in Portuguese) is a family car which was sold by Ford do Brasil in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Venezuela. It was also assembled in Venezuela (along with the upscale Del Rey derivative). The French-influenced styling of the Corcel was unique to Brazil until late 1977. From this year, the redesigned Corcel II (as it was originally sold) bore a strong resemblance to the European Ford Escort and Ford Cortina of same era, but its Renault underpinnings remained the same. The Corcel was eventually replaced by the Del Rey, which was originally introduced as a better equipped version of the Corcel.

==Origins==
The Corcel&#x27;s origins lay in the Renault 12. Willys-Overland&#x27;s Brazilian operations included manufacturing the Renault Dauphine as the Willys Dauphine/Gordini/1093/Teimoso. Plans were underway to replace this outmoded range with a new car based on the upcoming Renault 12, internally referred to as &quot;Project M&quot;. When Willys do Brasil was bought by Ford do Brasil in 1967, Ford inherited the project, meaning that the Corcel was actually presented nearly two years before the Renault 12.

==Corcel I==
The first year of production of the Brazilian Ford Corcel was 1968, when it debuted as a four-door sedan at São Paulo. It was originally equipped with the water-cooled overhead-valve &quot;Cléon&quot; engine picked directly from the Renault 12, albeit with a slightly lower compression ratio of 8:1 to allow it to run on 70 octane gasoline. A coupé was added in 1969 to target the second-car market, quickly becoming the fastest-selling version, followed by a three-door station wagon version called &quot;Belina&quot; in March 1970.

The early Corcels had severe quality issues and sales suffered accordingly, but after Ford do Brasil received a new head (Joseph W. O&#x27;Neill) in 1970 the decision was made to ameliorate the situation. In Brazil&#x27;s first automotive recall, 65,000 owners were contacted and free repairs were made available; the Corcel once again became Ford&#x27;s biggest selling model in 1971. In 1971 two new models appeared, with the L (for &quot;Luxo&quot;) and the more powerful GT version added. The GT benefitted from a twin-barrel carburettor (&quot;1300-C&quot;) and offered and could reach rather than the of the regular versions. Each passing year running styling changes were made, borrowing several details from the Ford Maverick, and becoming more and more like a pony car in appearance. The GT was updated in the form of new decals every year, and eventually also got a larger, more powerful engine.

=== Facelift 1973 ===
The facelifted Corcel I (sometimes called the &quot;Mark 1½&quot;) arrived in 1973 and had a more aggressive look compared to the more conservative 1968 version. Some of the L and all GT versions were also equipped with a new, bored out 1.4-litre (1372 cc) version of the existing engine. Claimed power for the regular Corcel was (SAE gross), with on tap at 5400 rpm from the &quot;XP&quot; engine used in the GT, with its double-barrel carburettor. With the later SAE net ratings, these figures became and .

=== Facelift 1975 ===
In 1975 a minor facelift occurred, in which the grille and headlight surrounds were subtly changed and the Ford logo moved from the grille onto the leading edge of the bonnet, along with the existing &quot;F O R D&quot; script. The taillights were now single-piece units. Also new for 1975 was the luxurious &quot;LDO&quot; version, available as a coupé or estate. Meanwhile, the locally developed 1.4 gradually replaced the old 1.3 throughout the lineup. This was very easy to modify for greater power and some dealers had the option to install an unofficial small tuning kit that would improve the engine&#x27;s horsepower to 95 (SAE Gross). Note that all of these power outputs were achieved using the low quality, low octane petrol available in South America at the time.

The Corcel GT was moderately successful in Brazilian Tarumã, Interlagos and beach rally street car championships during the 1970s, thanks to its front-wheel-drive stability and low weight (920 kg), which allowed a high power-to-weight ratio. It would not be faster than the V-8 Maverick and Chevrolet Opala, but it would beat everything else in the Brazilian market, including four- and six-cylinder Mavericks and some Dodge Chargers that partook of the events. These competitions uncovered that the front drive universal joint was prone to break under heavy stress, so in 1976 the Corcel line switched to constant-velocity joints.

==Corcel II==
In 1977, for the 1978 model year, Ford launched the Corcel II. The second generation had a completely remade design and straight lines as opposed to the pony car style of the original Corcel. These changes were also applied to the Belina, while the four-door version was dropped in response to lack of consumer interest. The resulting two-door sedan was of a fastback style, with long and heavy doors. 

Originally equipped with the same 1.4-litre four as the first Corcel, the engine was now rated at DIN for the base, Luxo, and LDO versions. The somewhat sporting GT received , courtesy of a twin-barrel Solex carburettor. The Corcel II was also used for an FIA Group 1 one-marque championship in Brazil, in the years of 1979 to 1983.

The Ford Del Rey was introduced in 1981, with a more upright roofline and available four-door bodywork. The Del Rey also had a reworked, more square front design. A station wagon version of the Del Rey (called the Ford Scala until 1986) differed from the Belina only in trim and in the front design. The traditional Ford name Victoria was to be used on this version but was dropped at the last minute. The Ford Corcel II also provided the basis for a pick-up version called the Ford Pampa in 1982, although this used the shorter front doors of the four-door Ford Del Rey since there was no need to access the back seat. The Pampa would eventually also be available with four-wheel drive.

As of 1982, the engine was a CHT, an improved version of the &quot;Cléon&quot; engine used in the first Corcel of 1968. It had already been bored and stroked to 1555 cc years earlier, but with a redesigned cylinder head, a rotating valve design and many other peripheral improvements it received a new name and a new lease on life. On 30 October 1981, Venezuelan assembly of the Corcel II commenced. In 1986, Ford Motor de Venezuela produced 2244 Corcel IIs and 2439 Corcel Ghias (all two-door sedans), although by then, it was concentrating on production of the European-sourced Ford Sierra. 

===Facelift===
All had a slight face lift for the 1985 model year. The Corcel II became known again simply as the Corcel. The interior was now the same for all four models. Externally, the Corcel and the Del Rey differed at the rear; the Corcel received fastback-style bodywork while the Del Rey was of a more traditional sedan design. The Belina and the Scala, however, had by now lost nearly all of their interior/exterior differences and became near identical: only a few details, such as the taillamps, differentiated these two models. Between 1985 and 1987 the Belina was made available with the same four-wheel-drive system used in the Pampa. This system seemed to have questionable reliability; &quot;Quatro Rodas&quot; magazine did a long-term test of a Belina 4x4 (50,000 km) in which breakdowns were very frequent - the resulting bad reputation led to Belina 4x4 production ending after only a few model years, while the Pampa 4x4 continued to be available.

1986 was the last year for the Corcel. The Belina was also discontinued in 1986, but its name was from then on applied to what had been the Scala (a name that had never really caught on) as the &quot;Del Rey Belina&quot;. In 1989, as a result of the Autolatina joint-venture, the higher output Volkswagen AP-1800 engine replaced the 1.6-litre unit in all models of the Del Rey and Belina, and was made available in all models of the Pampa except for the ones with four-wheel drive.

The Del Rey and the &quot;new&quot; Belina were discontinued in 1991, being replaced by the Volkswagen Santana-derived Ford Versailles and Royale respectively. The Pampa continued to be sold on until 1997, when Ford introduced the smaller, Fiesta-based Ford Courier a year later.

<text>Letterpress printing is a technique of relief printing for producing many copies by repeated direct impression of an inked, raised surface against individual sheets of paper or a continuous roll of paper. A worker composes and locks movable type into the &quot;bed&quot; or &quot;chase&quot; of a press, inks it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type, which creates an impression on the paper.

In practice, letterpress also includes wood engravings; photo-etched zinc plates (&quot;cuts&quot;); linoleum blocks, which can be used alongside metal type; wood type in a single operation; stereotypes; and electrotypes of type and blocks. With certain letterpress units, it is also possible to join movable type with slugs cast using hot metal typesetting. In theory, anything that is &quot;type high&quot; (i.e. it forms a layer exactly 0.918 inches thick between the bed and the paper) can be printed using letterpress.

Letterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century through the 19th century, and remained in wide use for books and other uses until the second half of the 20th century. The development of offset printing in the early 20th century gradually supplanted its role in printing books and newspapers. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.

==History==

Movable type printing was first invented in China using ceramic type in AD 1040 during the Northern Song dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng (990–1051).

Johannes Gutenberg is credited with the development in the West, in about 1440, of modern movable type printing from individually cast, reusable letters set together in a &quot;forme&quot; (frame or chase). Gutenberg also invented a wooden printing press, based on the extant wine press, where the type surface was inked with leather-covered ink balls and paper laid carefully on top by hand, then slid under a padded surface and pressure applied from above by a large threaded screw. It was Gutenberg&#x27;s &quot;screw press&quot; or hand press that was used to print 180 copies of the Bible. At 1,282 pages, it took him and his staff of 20 almost 3 years to complete. 48 Gutenberg Bibles remain intact today. This form of presswork gradually replaced the hand-copied manuscripts of scribes and illuminators as the most prevalent form of printing. Printers&#x27; workshops, previously unknown in Europe before the mid-15th century, were found in every important metropolis by 1500. Later metal presses used a knuckle and lever arrangement instead of the screw, but the principle was the same. Ink rollers made of composition made inking faster and paved the way for further automation.

===Industrialization===

With the advent of the Industrial Revolution and industrial mechanisation, inking was carried out by rollers that passed over the face of the type, then moved out of the way onto an ink plate to pick up a fresh film of ink for the next sheet. Meanwhile, a sheet of paper slid against a hinged platen (see image), which then rapidly pressed onto the type and swung back again as the sheet was removed and the next sheet inserted. As the fresh sheet of paper replaced the printed paper, the now freshly inked rollers ran over the type again. Fully automated 20th-century presses, such as the Kluge and &quot;Original&quot; Heidelberg Platen (the &quot;Windmill&quot;), incorporated pneumatic sheet feed and delivery.

Rotary presses were used for high-speed work. In the oscillating press, the forme slid under a drum around which each sheet of paper was wrapped for the impression, sliding back under the inking rollers while the paper was removed and a new sheet inserted. In a newspaper press, a papier-mâché mixture called a flong was used to make a mould of the entire form of type, then dried and bent, and a curved metal stereotype plate cast against it. The plates were clipped to a rotating drum and could print against a continuous reel of paper at the enormously high speeds required for overnight newspaper production.
This invention helped aid the high demand for knowledge during this time period.

==North American history==

===Canada===
Letterpress printing was introduced in Canada in 1752 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, by John Bushell in the newspaper format. This paper was named the Halifax Gazette and became Canada&#x27;s first newspaper. Bushell apprenticed under Bartholomew Green in Boston. Green moved to Halifax in 1751 in hopes of starting a newspaper, as there had never been one in the area. Two weeks and a day after the press he was going to use for this new project arrived in Halifax, Green died. Upon receiving word about what happened, Bushell moved to Halifax and continued what Green had started. &quot;The Halifax Gazette&quot; was first published on March 23, 1752, making Bushell the first letterpress printer in any of the areas that later became Canada. There is only one known surviving copy of the first number, which was found in the Massachusetts Historical Society.

===United States===
One of the first forms of letterpress printing in the United States was Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick started by Benjamin Harris. This was the first form of a newspaper with multiple pages in the Americas. The first publication of Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick was September 25, 1690.

==Revival and rise of craft letterpress==

Letterpress started to become largely out-of-date in the 1970s because of the rise of computers and new self-publishing print and publish methods. Many printing establishments went out of business from the 1980s to 1990s and sold their equipment after computers replaced letterpress&#x27;s abilities more efficiently. These commercial print shops discarded presses, making them affordable and available to artisans throughout the country. Popular presses include, in particular, Vandercook cylinder proof presses and Chandler &amp; Price platen presses. In the UK there is particular affection for the Arab press, built by Josiah Wade in Halifax.
Letterpress recently has had a rebirth in popularity because of the &quot;allure of hand-set type&quot; and the differences today between traditional letterpress and computerized printed text. Letterpress is unique and different from standard printing formats that we are currently used to. Letterpress commonly features a relief impression of the type, although this was considered bad printing in traditional letterpress. Letterpress&#x27;s goal before the recent revival of letterpress was to not show any impression. The type touched the paper slightly to leave a transfer of ink, but did not leave an impression. This is often referred to as &quot;the kiss&quot;. An example of this former technique would be newspapers. Some letterpress practitioners today have the distinct goal of showing the impression of type, to distinctly note that it is letterpress, but many printers choose to maintain the integrity of the traditional methods. Printing with too much impression is destructive to both the machines and to the type. Since its revival letterpress has largely been used for fine art and stationery as its traditional use for newspaper printing is no longer relevant for use.

Letterpress is considered a craft as it involves using a skill and is done by hand. Fine letterpress work is crisper than offset litho because of its impression into the paper, giving greater visual definition to the type and artwork, although it is not what letterpress traditionally was meant for. Today, many of these small letterpress shops survive by printing fine editions of books or by printing upscale invitations, stationery, and greeting cards. These methods often use presses that require the press operator to feed paper one sheet at a time by hand. Today, the juxtaposition of this technique and offbeat humor for greeting cards has been proven by letterpress shops to be marketable to independent boutiques and gift shops. Some of these printmakers are just as likely to use new printing methods as old, for instance by printing using photopolymer plates on restored vintage presses.

===Martha Stewart&#x27;s influence===
Letterpress publishing has recently undergone a revival in the US, Canada, and the UK, under the general banner of the &quot;Small Press Movement&quot;. Renewed interest in letterpress was fueled by Martha Stewart Weddings magazine, which began using pictures of letterpress invitations in the 1990s. In 2004 they state &quot;Great care is taken in choosing the perfect wedding stationery – couples ponder details from the level of formality to the flourishes of the typeface. The method of printing should be no less important, as it can enliven the design exquisitely. That is certainly the case with letterpress.&quot; In regards to having printed letterpress invitations, the beauty and texture became appealing to couples who began wanting letterpress invitations instead of engraved, thermographed, or offset-printed invitations.

===Education===
The movement has been helped by the emergence of a number of organizations that teach letterpress such as Columbia College Chicago&#x27;s Center for Book and Paper Arts, Art Center College of Design and Armory Center for the Arts both in Pasadena, Calif., New York&#x27;s Center for Book Arts, Studio on the Square and The Arm NYC, the Wells College Book Arts Center in Aurora, New York, the San Francisco Center for the Book, Bookworks, Seattle&#x27;s School of Visual Concepts, Olympia&#x27;s The Evergreen State College, Black Rock Press, North Carolina State University, Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Corcoran College of Art and Design, Penland School of Crafts, the Minnesota Center for Book Arts, the International Printing Museum in Carson, CA, Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, and the Bowehouse Press at VCU in Richmond, VA.

===Economical materials===
Affordable copper, magnesium and photopolymer platemakers and milled aluminum bases have allowed letterpress printers to produce type and images derived from digital artwork, fonts and scans. Economical plates have encouraged the rise of &quot;digital letterpress&quot; in the 21st century, allowing a small number of firms to flourish commercially and enabling a larger number of boutique and hobby printers to avoid the limitations and complications of acquiring and composing metal type. At the same time there has been a renaissance in small-scale type foundries to produce new metal type on Monotype equipment, Thompson casters and the original American Type Founders machines.

==Process==
The process of letterpress printing consists of several stages: composition, imposition and lock-up, and printing. In a small shop, all would occur in a single room, whereas in larger printing plants, such as with urban newspapers and magazines, each might form a distinct department with its own room, or even floor.

===Composition===
Composition, or typesetting, is the stage where pieces of movable type are assembled to form the desired text. The person charged with composition is called a &quot;compositor&quot; or &quot;typesetter&quot;, setting letter by letter and line by line.

Traditionally, as in manual composition, it involves selecting the individual type letters from a type case, placing them in a composing stick, which holds several lines, then transferring those to a larger type galley. By this method the compositor gradually builds out the text of an individual page letter by letter. In mechanical typesetting, it may involve using a keyboard to select the type, or even cast the desired type on the spot, as in hot metal typesetting, which are then added to a galley designed for the product of that process. The first keyboard-actuated typesetting machines to be widely accepted, the Linotype and the Monotype, were introduced in the 1890s.

The Ludlow Typograph Machine, for casting of type-high slugs from hand-gathered brass matrices, was first manufactured in Chicago in 1912 and was widely used until the 1980s. Many are still in use and although no longer manufactured, service and parts are still available for them.

The Elrod machine, invented in 1920, casts strip material from molten metal; leads and slugs that are not type-high (do not print) used for spacing between lines and to fill blank areas of the type page. 

After a galley is assembled to fill a page&#x27;s worth of type, the type is tied together into a single unit so that it may be transported without falling apart. From this bundle a galley proof is made, which is inspected by a proof-reader to make sure that the particular page is accurate.

===Imposition===
Broadly, imposition or imposing is the process by which the tied assemblages of type are converted into a form (or forme) ready to use on the press. A person charged with imposition is a stoneman or stonehand, doing their work on a large, flat imposition stone (though some later ones were instead made of iron).

In the more specific modern sense, imposition is the technique of arranging the various pages of type with respect to one another. Depending on page size and the sheet of paper used, several pages may be printed at once on a single sheet. After printing, these are cut and trimmed before folding or binding. In these steps, the imposition process ensures that the pages face the right direction and in the right order with the correct margins.

Low-height pieces of wood or metal furniture are added to make up the blank areas of a page. The printer uses a mallet to strike a wooden block, which ensures tops (and only the tops) of the raised type blocks are all aligned so they will contact a flat sheet of paper simultaneously.

Lock-up is the final step before printing. The printer removes the cords that hold the type together, and expands the quoins with a key or lever to lock the entire complex of type, blocks, furniture, and chase (frame) into place. This creates the final forme, which the printer takes to the printing press. In a newspaper setting, each page needs a truck to be transported – 2 pages need 2 trucks hence the term &quot;double truck&quot;. The first copy is proofed again for errors before starting the printing run.

===Printing===
The working of the printing process depends on the type of press used, as well as any of its associated technologies (which varied by time period).

Hand presses generally required two people to operate them: one to ink the type, the other to work the press. Later mechanized jobbing presses require a single operator to feed and remove the paper, as the inking and pressing are done automatically.

The completed sheets are then taken to dry and for finishing, depending on the variety of printed matter being produced. With newspapers, they are taken to a folding machine. Sheets for books are sent for bookbinding.

The output of traditional letterpress printing can be distinguished from that of a digital printer by its debossed lettering or imagery. A traditional letterpress printer made a heavy impression into the stock and producing any indentation at all into the paper would have resulted in the print run being rejected. Part of the skill of operating a traditional letterpress printer was to adjust the machine pressures just right so that the type just kissed the paper, transferring the minimum amount of ink to create the crispest print with no indentation. This was very important as when the print exited the machine and was stacked having too much wet ink and an indentation would have increased the risk of set-off (ink passing from the front of one sheet onto the back of the next sheet on the stack).

===Photopolymer plates===

The letterpress printing process remained virtually unchanged until the 1950s when it was replaced with the more efficient and commercially viable offset printing process. The labor-intensive nature of the typesetting and need to store vast amounts of lead or wooden type resulted in the letterpress printing process falling out of favour.

In the 1980s dedicated letterpress practitioners revived the old craft by embracing a new manufacturing method which allowed them to create raised surface printing plates from a negative and a photopolymer plate.

Photopolymer plates are light sensitive. On one side the surface is cured when it is exposed to ultraviolet light and the other side is a metal or plastic backing that can be mounted on a base. The relief printing surface is created by placing a negative of the piece to be printed on the photosensitive side of the plate; the light passing through the clear regions of the negative causes the photopolymer to harden. The unexposed areas remain soft and can be washed away with water.

With these new printing plates, designers were no longer inhibited by the limitations of handset wooden or lead type. New design possibilities emerged and the letterpress printing process experienced a revival. Today it is in high demand for wedding stationery however there are limitations to what can be printed and designers must adhere to some design for letterpress principles.

==Variants on the letterpress==
The invention of ultra-violet curing inks has helped keep the rotary letterpress alive in areas like self-adhesive labels. There is also still a large amount of flexographic printing, a similar process, which uses rubber plates to print on curved or awkward surfaces, and a lesser amount of relief printing from huge wooden letters for lower-quality poster work.

Rotary letterpress machines are still used on a wide scale for printing self-adhesive and non-self-adhesive labels, tube laminate, cup stock, etc. The printing quality achieved by a modern letterpress machine with UV curing is on par with flexo presses. It is more convenient and user friendly than a flexo press. It uses water-wash photopolymer plates, which are as good as any solvent-washed flexo plate. Today even CtP (computer-to-plate) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no anilox roller in the process, the make-ready time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an offset press. UV inks for letterpress are in paste form, unlike flexo. Various manufacturers produce UV rotary letterpress machines, viz. Dashen, Nickel, Taiyo Kikai, KoPack, Gallus, etc. – and offer hot/cold foil stamping, rotary die cutting, flatbed die cutting, sheeting, rotary screen printing, adhesive side printing, and inkjet numbering. Central impression presses are more popular than inline presses due to their ease of registration and simple design. Printing of up to nine colours plus varnish is possible with various online converting processes. But as the letterpress machines are the same like a decade before, they can furthermore only be used with one colour of choice simultaneously. If there are more colours needed, they have to be exchanged one after the other.

==Craftsmanship==

Letterpress can produce work of high quality at high speed, but it requires much time to adjust the press for varying thicknesses of type, engravings, and plates called makeready. The process requires a high degree of craftsmanship. It is used by many small presses that produce fine, handmade, limited-edition books, artists&#x27; books, and high-end ephemera such as greeting cards and broadsides. Because of the time needed to make letterpress plates and to prepare the press, setting type by hand has become less common with the invention of the photopolymer plate, a photosensitive plastic sheet that can be mounted on metal to bring it up to type high.

To bring out the best attributes of letterpress, printers must understand the capabilities and advantages of the medium. For instance, since most letterpress equipment prints only one color at a time, printing multiple colors requires a separate press run in register with the preceding color. When offset printing arrived in the 1950s, it cost less, and made the color process easier. The inking system on letterpress equipment is the same as offset presses, posing problems for some graphics. Detailed, white (or &quot;knocked out&quot;) areas, such as small, serif type, or very fine halftone surrounded by fields of color can fill in with ink and lose definition if rollers are not adjusted correctly.

==Current initiatives==


Several dozen colleges and universities around the United States have either begun or re-activated programs teaching letterpress printing in fully equipped facilities. In many cases these letterpress shops are affiliated with the college&#x27;s library or art department, and in others they are independent, student-run operations or extracurricular activities sponsored by the college. The College &amp; University Letterpress Printers&#x27; Association (CULPA) was founded in 2006 by Abigail Uhteg at the Maryland Institute College of Art to help these schools stay connected and share resources. Many universities offer degree programs such as: Oregon College of Art and Craft, Southwest School of Art, Middle Tennessee State University, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Indiana University, Miami University, Corcoran College of Art and Design, and Rochester Institute of Technology.

The current renaissance of letterpress printing has created a crop of hobby press shops that are owner-operated and driven by a love of the craft. Several larger printers have added an environmental component to the venerable art by using only wind-generated electricity to drive their presses and plant equipment. Notably, a few small boutique letterpress shops are using only solar power.

In Berkeley, California, letterpress printer and lithographer David Lance Goines maintains a studio with a variety of platen and cylinder letterpresses as well as lithography presses. He has drawn attention both from commercial printers and fine artists for his wide knowledge and meticulous skill with letterpress printing. He collaborated with restaurateur and free speech activist Alice Waters, the owner of Chez Panisse, on her book &quot;30 Recipes Suitable for Framing&quot;. He has created strikingly colorful large posters for such Bay Area businesses and institutions as Acme Bread and UC Berkeley. Another Berkeley letterpress printer is Peter Rutledge Koch, who focuses on artist books and small published books.

In London, St Bride Library houses a large collection of letterpress information in its collection of 50,000 books: all the classic works on printing technique, visual style, typography, graphic design, calligraphy and more. This is one of the world&#x27;s foremost collections and is located off Fleet Street in the heart of London&#x27;s old printing and publishing district. In addition, regular talks, conferences, exhibitions and demonstrations take place.

The St Bride Institute, Edinburgh College of Art, Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, The Arts University Bournemouth, Plymouth University, University for the Creative Arts Farnham, London College of Communication and Camberwell College of the Arts London run short courses in letterpress as well as offering these facilities as part of their Graphic Design Degree Courses.

The Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, houses one of the largest collections of wood type and wood cuts in the world inside one of the Hamilton Manufacturing Company&#x27;s factory buildings. Also included are presses and vintage prints. The museum holds many workshops and conferences throughout the year and regularly welcomes groups of students from universities from across the United States.

In 2015, the New York Times reported a renaissance of letterpress printing as an art form.

<doc id="662135" wikidata="Q1378237" url="?curid=662135" title="John Tortorella">
<text>John Tortorella (born June 24, 1958) is an American professional ice hockey coach and former player who is the head coach for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Tortorella was previously the head coach of the NHL&#x27;s Columbus Blue Jackets, New York Rangers, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Vancouver Canucks. He led Tampa Bay to the 2004 Stanley Cup championship.

He is the first American-born NHL coach to reach 500 wins and as of the end of the 2023–24 season he is ninth all-time in wins with 742. He has twice won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL&#x27;s top coach.

Tortorella is well known for his outspoken and sometimes confrontational nature, which has included criticizing his own players and members of the media. Tortorella is also known for his system of regularly rotating goaltending duties during his time in Tampa Bay, a system which was discontinued when he became head coach of the New York Rangers and used Henrik Lundqvist as the regular starting goalie. This system returned in the 2019–20 NHL season with the Columbus Blue Jackets, with the emergence of Joonas Korpisalo and Elvis Merzļikins as the goaltender tandem.

==Playing career==
Tortorella attended Concord-Carlisle High School in Concord, Massachusetts, and he is listed on the school&#x27;s athletic Hall of Fame wall (1976). John&#x27;s brother, Jim, a goaltender, is also listed on the wall.

Nicknamed &quot;The Paper Italian&quot;, Tortorella played right wing for three years (1978–1981) at the University of Maine. While at Maine, he played with his brother Jim, who later became assistant coach for the Harvard Crimson.

After college, Tortorella went to Sweden to play a year on Kristianstads IK (1981–1982). After his season in Sweden, he came back to the United States to play four years of minor professional ice hockey (1982–1986) in the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL). During these years, he played for the Hampton Roads Gulls, Erie Golden Blades and the Virginia Lancers. Tortorella never played a game in the NHL.

==Coaching career==
===ECHL and AHL teams===
Tortorella&#x27;s coaching career began with the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s Rochester Americans and the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL)&#x27;s Virginia Lancers. He won the Calder Cup with the 1996 Rochester Americans.

Tortorella has been credited by ECHL founders Henry Brabham and Bill Coffey for coming up with the name for the league during a meeting at a Ramada Inn in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At the time, Tortorella was the head coach of Brabham&#x27;s Virginia Lancers, but he left the Lancers to become the assistant coach of the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s New Haven Nighthawks before the ECHL&#x27;s inaugural season in 1988.

===Tampa Bay Lightning===
Tortorella took over the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2000–01 as a midseason head coach replacement. He inherited a team that had been among the dregs of the league for four years, having lost 50 games or more in every season during that time. The team won only 12 of its last 43 games under his watch, finishing last in the division. The following season, the team finished well out of playoff contention despite finishing third in the Southeast Division. However, they showed signs of life for the first time in five years, cracking the 60-point barrier for the first time since 1996–97.

The 2002–03 season marked Tortorella&#x27;s first winning season as an NHL head coach, as the Lightning won their first Southeast Division title, losing to the New Jersey Devils four games to one in the second round of the 2003 playoffs. At the end of the season he was also recognized as a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year, losing out to Minnesota&#x27;s Jacques Lemaire.

In 2003–04, Tortorella&#x27;s fourth season with the team, the Lightning ran away with the Southeast Division title, tallying 106 points—the second-best record in the league. The Lightning were the top seed in the Eastern Conference and proceeded to defeat the New York Islanders, the Montreal Canadiens, and the Philadelphia Flyers to win the Prince of Wales Trophy. In the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, they defeated the Western Conference champion Calgary Flames four games to three, winning the first Stanley Cup in franchise history. In doing so Tortorella became just the third American-born coach to win it and the first in 13 years. The team was in its eleventh year of existence. It was the last Stanley Cup won before the 2004–05 NHL lockout. A few days after winning the Stanley Cup, Tortorella won the 2004 Jack Adams Award as coach of the year.

Before the start of the 2005–06 season – the NHL&#x27;s first post-lockout campaign – Tampa Bay&#x27;s starting goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin left the team due to the newly implemented salary cap restrictions. Tortorella was hard on Lightning goaltender John Grahame for much of the 2005–06.

Grahame subsequently signed with the Carolina Hurricanes before the start of the 2006–07 season. Despite the Lightning winning a 2nd-team best 44 games in 2006–07, the Lightning were unable to defend their division title.

On March 11, 2008, with the Lightning defeat of the New York Islanders, Tortorella passed Bob Johnson as the most successful American-born NHL coach with 235 victories.

After getting fired by the Lightning in the 2008 off-season, Tortorella was an in-studio panelist on the &quot;NHL on TSN&quot;. During this time, on November 7, 2008, Peter Laviolette would overtake his victory total for an American coach.

===New York Rangers===

Tortorella was named head coach of the New York Rangers on February 23, 2009, replacing Tom Renney, who was relieved of his duties earlier that day. On March 17, he again became the American-born coach with the most wins in NHL history, this time surpassing Laviolette. Tortorella was suspended one game by the NHL for an altercation with several Capitals fans behind the bench in the third period of Game 5 in the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs. Replays show a fan clearly heckling Tortorella, before Tortorella responded by throwing a water bottle at a fan and then grabbing a stick from Aaron Voros and trying to spear the fan through a space between two panes of glass. He did not receive a penalty on the play despite the fact that NHL rules state any physical altercation with fans results in ejection from the game; however, the next day the NHL suspended him.

When Laviolette became coach of the Philadelphia Flyers in 2009, the rivalry between the two teams became further heated with Tortorella and Laviolette being the winningest U.S.-born coaches in NHL history. On November 20, 2010, Tortorella became the first American-born coach to reach 300 NHL victories when the Rangers defeated the Minnesota Wild.

In the 2011–12 season he guided the Rangers to the franchise&#x27;s third ever 50-win season and the best record in the Eastern Conference with a total of 51–24–7 for 109 points. New York lost in the Conference Finals however, to the New Jersey Devils in six games. At season&#x27;s end, Tortorella became a finalist for the Jack Adams Award for a third time, losing to Ken Hitchcock of the St. Louis Blues.

On March 26, 2013, with a 5–2 defeat of Laviolette&#x27;s Flyers, Tortorella became the first U.S.-born coach to reach 400 career victories.

The Rangers fired Tortorella on May 29, 2013, four days after New York was eliminated from the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Boston Bruins.

===Vancouver Canucks===

The Vancouver Canucks announced Tortorella as the team&#x27;s new coach on June 25, 2013. He replaced Alain Vigneault, who coincidentally had been hired by the Rangers to replace Tortorella.

Tortorella earned his first victory with the Canucks against the Edmonton Oilers on October 5, 2013, with a final score of 6–2.

During the first intermission of a game on January 18, 2014, Tortorella entered the Calgary Flames dressing room area in an apparent attempt to confront Flames coach Bob Hartley; after a line brawl in the opening seconds of the 1st period, Tortorella angrily attempted to confront Hartley, accusing him of starting a lineup with intent to injure a star Canuck player. Tortorella had to be physically restrained by several players and coaches. The NHL subsequently suspended him for 15 days without pay, barring him from being in contact with the team during his suspension. Canucks assistant coach Mike Sullivan took over the head coaching job during Tortorella&#x27;s suspension.

On March 2, 2014, Tortorella sparked controversy when he chose to start Eddie Läck in the 2014 Heritage Classic held in Vancouver over Roberto Luongo Luongo was openly disappointed and was traded two days later.

He lived full-time in Point Roberts, Washington instead of in Vancouver. Tortorella was criticized by his players for the inadequate amount of practice days, of which he would drive in for a brief appearance, then leave his assistants to handle everything else before returning home. This arrangement frustrated general manager Mike Gillis who had a bed built into Tortorella&#x27;s office so he could take naps there instead of driving home. 

Tortorella&#x27;s tenure with the Canucks would last only a single season, as the team missed the playoffs for the first time since 2008. On May 1, 2014, Tortorella and assistant coach Mike Sullivan were fired as part of a management overhaul that had also seen General Manager Mike Gillis let go several weeks prior.

===Columbus Blue Jackets===
On October 21, 2015, Tortorella was hired to replace Todd Richards as the Columbus Blue Jackets&#x27; head coach, after the Blue Jackets started the 2015–16 season with a 0–7–0 record. As compensation for hiring Tortorella, the Vancouver Canucks received the 55th overall pick (used to select Jonah Gadjovich) in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft from the Blue Jackets. On March 19, 2016, the Blue Jackets faced the New Jersey Devils and Tortorella became the 26th head coach in NHL history, and the first born in the United States, to coach 1,000 games.

On December 18, 2016, the Blue Jackets defeated the Canucks in overtime 4–3, making Tortorella the first American-born coach with 500 victories. His success in the 2016-17 NHL season resulted in his second Jack Adams Award.

On January 10, 2019, Tortorella became the first American-born coach, and 19th overall, to reach 600 victories when the Blue Jackets defeated the Nashville Predators. In the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, Tortorella&#x27;s Blue Jackets won their first playoff series in franchise history by eliminating his old team, the Tampa Bay Lightning; also being the first time that the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning team failed to win any playoff game despite the Lightning matching the record of 62 regular season wins.

On January 2, 2020, Tortorella was fined $20,000 by the NHL for negative comments he made about the on-ice officials on December 29, 2019, after they mishandled the clock in overtime, causing the Blue Jackets to lose 3–2 against the Chicago Blackhawks. The NHL required Tortorella to refrain from similar behavior for the remainder of the year or be fined $25,000; however, on August 25, 2020, Tortorella was fined an additional $25,000 for his actions during virtual media availability following the Blue Jackets&#x27; elimination from the playoff bubble by the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning. In spite of the controversy, he was named a Jack Adams finalist for the second time as Blue Jackets coach and fifth overall.

On May 9, 2021, Tortorella agreed to mutually part ways with the Blue Jackets after the expiration of his contract. Tortorella finished his tenure with the Blue Jackets with the most wins of any head coach in franchise history.

===Philadelphia Flyers===
After spending the 2021-22 season as a studio analyst on ESPN, Tortorella was named the head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers on June 17, 2022. On December 29, 2023, Tortorella coached his 1,500th NHL regular season game becoming the eighth head coach in NHL history, and the first American-born coach to reach the mark.

On March 9, 2024, Tortorella was ejected from a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning following a verbal dispute with referees Wes McCauley and Brandon Schrader. Despite this, Tortorella stalled and stayed on the Flyers bench for several minutes, continuing his altercation with McCauley and Schrader before eventually leaving. The following day, Tortorella was suspended for two games and was fined $50,000.

===United States national men&#x27;s team===
Tortorella was the assistant coach of the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team in 2008–2009, replacing Peter Laviolette, which included leading the squad at the 2008 IIHF World Championship, where they finished sixth.

Tortorella was tapped to coach Team USA at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. In the lead-up to the tournament, he said he would &quot;sit&quot; any player who protests during the playing of the national anthem. The team ultimately failed to make it out of the group stage, losing all three games.

<text>A blackhouse ( ; ) is a traditional type of house which used to be common in Ireland, the Hebrides, and the Scottish Highlands.

== Origin of the name ==

The origin of the name blackhouse is of some debate. On the Isle of Lewis, in particular, it seems to have been used to distinguish the older blackhouses from some of the newer white-houses ( , ; ), with their harled (rendered) stone walls. There may also be some confusion arising from the phonetic similarity between the dubh, meaning black, and tughadh, meaning thatch.

== Description ==

The buildings were generally built with double wall dry-stone walls packed with earth, and were roofed with wooden rafters covered with a thatch of turf with cereal straw or reed. The floor was generally flagstones or packed earth and there was a central hearth for the fire. There was no chimney for the smoke to escape through. Instead the smoke made its way through the roof. This led to the soot blackening of the interior which may also have contributed to the adoption of the name blackhouse.

The blackhouse was used to accommodate livestock as well as people. People lived at one end and the animals lived at the other with a partition between them.

== Lewis blackhouse ==

Although the Lewis blackhouses have a look of real antiquity, most of the upstanding ruins were built less than 150 years ago. Many were still roofed until the 1970s but without the necessary annual repairs deteriorated rapidly; as people moved into more modern dwellings with indoor plumbing and better heating, most have fallen into ruin. However, blackhouses are increasingly being restored, especially for use as holiday accommodation.
The blackhouses on Lewis have roofs thatched with cereal straw over turf and thick, stone-lined walls with an earthen core. Roof timbers rise from the inner face of the walls providing a characteristic ledge at the wall head (&quot;tobhta&quot;). This gives access to the roof for thatching. Both the animals and occupants shared the same door, living at different ends of the same space. Several long ranges, or rooms, were usually built alongside each other, each one having its own ridgeline, giving them the very distinctive look of the Lewis blackhouse.

The immediate origins of the blackhouse are unclear, as few pre-eighteenth century examples have ever been excavated. One reason for this is that, unlike their later counterparts, the early examples may have been made of turf and thatch and quickly returned to the earth once abandoned. As one of the most primitive forms of the North Atlantic longhouse tradition, it is very probable that the roots of the blackhouse, in which cattle and humans shared the same roof, is well over 1000 years old. The Lewis examples have clearly been modified to survive in the tough environment of the Outer Hebrides. Low rounded roofs, elaborately roped, were developed to resist the strong Atlantic winds, and walls were made thick to provide insulation and support the sideways forces of the short driftwood roof timbers.

<text>The Renault 7 (or &quot;R7&quot;) is a 4-door saloon version of the Renault 5 supermini, produced and sold in Spain by Renault&#x27;s subsidiary, FASA-Renault, from 1974 to 1984.

It was very similar to the R5 hatchback (which had been launched two years earlier), and identical mechanically, but offered with a smaller range of engines. The R7 had four doors and a saloon-style boot in place of the original car&#x27;s three (and later five) doors including hatchback. This involved extending the wheelbase by just under though it retained the wheelbase difference between left and right sides, characteristic of several Renault models, resulting from the use of full-width torsion bars placed one behind the other, ahead of the rear wheels.

Another difference between the Renault 7 and the 5 was the use, on the 7, of &#x27;conventional&#x27; chromed metal bumpers instead of off-body colour plastic ones, giving the car a more refined appearance. Initially powered by a 1037 cc engine, it was mostly sold in Spain. A total 159,533 units were produced; its success outside its home market was limited because Renault offered the larger Renault 12 for a small price premium.

The R7 was introduced two years after the launch of the R5, then restyled in 1979, followed by an engine upgrade to 1108 cc in 1980. Its production ended in 1984, after the R9 entered the worldwide market. A five-door version of the R5 was launched in 1980 using the door pattern of the Spanish R7. In 1984, the R5 had been substantially redesigned (now based on the R9/R11 floorpan) and R7 sales did not justify the investment necessary to develop a new version of the R7.

<text>The Renault 12 is a mid-size family car introduced by French automaker Renault at the Paris Motor Show in October 1969 and produced in France until 1980. Available as a saloon (&quot;Berline&quot;) and estate (&quot;Break&quot;), it was also produced under licence in many countries around the globe into the early 21st century.

In its first few years the 12 received praise from the European press for its spacious, comfortable interior, its styling, its performance and its low fuel consumption. However it fared worse in the North American press: in a test of the 1974 model, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; was critical of the engine&#x27;s &quot;obtrusive&quot; noise, and called the heavy, non-power steering &quot;a serious design flaw&quot;. They also gave it &quot;very poor marks&quot; for the ventilation system.

Renault 12 production and sales ended in western Europe in 1980, but the model continued to be produced and sold by Renault affiliates elsewhere. The last R12 was produced in 2000 in Turkey, while Romanian automaker Dacia continued producing the R12-based 1310 saloon and estate until 2004 and the R12-based Dacia Pick-Up until December 2006.

Commercially the Renault 12 was a successful car, selling 2.5 million units.

==Project==
In January 1964, the Styling Center began the design of the 117 model. This was a new model to bridge the gap between the Renault 8 and the Renault 16. The demands for &quot;Project 117&quot; were:

:&quot;The car had to be economical, not very sophisticated. It had to have a roomy interior, and a large boot, and a small engine will suffice. The car had to be easy to produce, so it could be made all over the world. It had to be reliable for the export markets, and comfortable enough for France. It should be usable as a base for multiple variations.&quot;

===Body===
The Renault 12&#x27;s design dates back to the genesis of the Renault 16; indeed, some initial R16 concept designs resemble the R12 more than the ultimate design of the R16. However, the R12 was technically quite different from either the R16 or the smaller Renault 4. Like all new Renaults at the time (and in common, by now, with more than 60% of the cars produced in France) the car had front wheel drive, but the R12 had a very different layout from Renault&#x27;s existing fwd models. The engine was placed longitudinally ahead of the front wheels, while it was behind the wheels on the R4 and R16.

At the time of its launch in October 1969 at the Paris Motor Show, the Renault 12 was only available as a 4-door saloon, in L and TL specifications. The more expensive TL featured two separate reclining front seats instead of one front bench seat, armrests on the doors, lights in the boot and glovebox, a heated rear window, and extra warning lights.

===Engine===
It would have been a simple matter to install the light weight engine from the Renault 16 in the Renault 12, and this was later done for some high-end versions. However Renault had successfully built European market share since 1945 by competing aggressively on price. In the closely contested 1300 cc category it was left to the new Peugeot 304 to attract customers willing to pay a premium price, while for the Renault 12, at launch, the aluminium block of the Renault 16 was rejected on cost grounds. Instead, Renault specified an enlarged version of the iron Cléon unit, used since 1962 in the Renault 8/10. The engine&#x27;s size was increased to 1289 cc for use in the 12. Listed power output was SAE ( DIN) which provided for a respectable top speed of 145 km/h (90 mph).

The new version of the five-bearing engine initially fitted on the Renault 12 retained the removable cylinder liners that Renault had long favoured. It rejected the &quot;oversquare&quot; cylinder dimensions that had become fashionable with some European auto-makers during the 1960s. Many components, such as the oil pump and the distributor were unchanged, while others, including the cylinder head, the valve gear and the engine block itself were only minimally updated. The only completely reworked elements were the cylinder liners, the connecting rods, the pistons themselves and the crankshaft. In the 1962 version of the engine the cylinders had been unevenly spaced in two groups of two, but in this new application they were equidistant in order to allow for the cylinder diameter, here increased to 73 mm, to be combined with space for sufficient coolant to circulate around the cylinders.

The longitudinal placement of the engine, most of its mass positioned ahead of the front wheels, allowed the R12 to have a very simple design of the gear-selector that was placed on the floor of the car, and not on the dashboard as with the R4 or on the steering column as with the R16. On the early cars the handle to operate the handbrake was placed under the dashboard. The handbrake was later relocated to a position between the two front seats.

===Suspension===
The R12&#x27;s suspension also differed from that of the R4 and R16, using a rigid (but light) rear axle as opposed to four-wheel independent suspension. The use of a rigid rear axle from a manufacturer that had championed all-round independent suspension for twenty-five years was seen by many commentators as a retrograde step.

==Later developments==


In 1970, two new variants were introduced. The estate was launched with the same trim levels and engines as in the saloon and a high-performance Renault 12 Gordini model was introduced equipped with the all-aluminium 1565 cc block from the R16 TS fitted with two double-barrel Weber carburettors producing , a reinforced crankshaft, a five-speed gearbox, ventilated disc brakes on the front wheels and normal disc brakes on the rear wheels, as well as a tuned suspension. The Gordini was able to reach and was sold with paint schemes comprising a solid pastel colour (there were several to choose from) with double white stripes added on, the most famous combination being French Blue with stripes. 2225 Renault 12 Gordinis were sold in 1971 but after that, sales began a freefall. Renault stopped production of the Gordini in 1974 after 5188 had been sold (compared to 11,607 Renault 8 Gordinis).

In October 1972, the more upmarket R12 TS was introduced. It used the same 1289 cc engine as in other R12s, but was equipped with a single, double barrel Weber carburettor, which increased power to and raised the top speed to . Aesthetically, the car was distinguishable from other R12s by its special Gordini-style wheels, a chrome strip along the side of the car, and in some countries, two extra headlights. The TS also featured integrated headrests, a tachometer and a cooling-fluid temperature gauge. October 1972 was also when the hand brake lever was relocated from a position ahead of the driver to a floor-mounted location between the front seats. This became possible because now, even on the base &quot;L&quot; version of the car, after the front bench seat was replaced by two individual seats.

In October 1973, at the Paris Motor Show, the R12 TR appeared. This model slotted between the TL and TS, and had automatic transmission as standard. This three-speed, torque converter unit was developed by Renault themselves and was notable for being electronically (rather than hydraulically) controlled. It had already been available in the Renault 16 for a few years, and in the 15/17 coupés since several months earlier.

The whole range was facelifted in 1975 with a simplified grille, new rear lamps and dashboard. The Renault 12&#x27;s successor, the Renault 18, was launched in 1978, but French production of the Renault 12 continued for two more years in spite of its successor&#x27;s instant popularity.

==Across the world==
The 12 was a global car, built in at least a dozen countries and marketed across all continents. It was even the basis for the GNW Duiker, a stillborn sporting convertible with a fiberglass body intended as the beginning of a Rhodesian national car project. The bankers disagreed and the plug was pulled in late 1972. A few examples seem to have been built.

===Romania===
Dacia acquired the tooling and basic designs of the Renault 12 and manufactured it in various body styles in Romania, as the Dacia 1300, between 1969 and 1979. Also, the successor of this car, named Dacia 1310, was based on Dacia 1300. The production of the 1310 started in 1979 and stopped in 2004.

The 35 years of production saw the manufacturing of a total of 1,959,730 vehicles plus, between 1975 and 2006, a total of 318,969 vehicles belonging to the range that came to be known under the generic name of Dacia Pick-Up.

===Turkey===

A Renault 12-based car was made in Turkey by Oyak-Renault between 1971 and 2000. The earlier models were similar to the original R12, then the car underwent a facelift in 1989 and was marketed under the name Renault Toros until it was discontinued due to stricter European emissions standards coming into effect. The name &quot;Toros&quot; has a dual etymology: one is the Taurus mountains (), the other is the submodel designation TS. Sold as a sedan or a station wagon (TSW), it has a 1.4 litre carburetted C1J (Cléon) engine with and came with either a four- or a five-speed transmission.

Renault 12 is the first Turkish-built automobile to be exported abroad and started to be exported to Lebanon in 1973. Turkish-built Renault 12s also exported to Algeria, Azerbaijan, Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Northern Cyprus, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Tunisia and Upper Volta.

===Australia===

The Renault 12 won Australia&#x27;s Wheels magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year award in 1970. It was built at Renault Australia&#x27;s assembly plant in the Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg from CKD kits. Various components such as seats were sourced locally.

The Australian range generally followed the UK models, including the facelift (which arrived in 1976) but, from about 1971, when new Australian Design Rules were introduced, had to have a special local wiper mechanism with a conventional right hand drive pattern (parking on the passenger side). This also affected locally assembled Peugeot 504 and Triumph 2.5 models. By the mid-1970s, local parts content had increased to represent about fifty percent.

In October 1976 the 1,289 cc engine was replaced by a larger capacity 1,397 cc version; the new model was marketed as the Renault 1.4 Litre, sometimes referred to simply as the &quot;Renault 1.4&quot;. This model incorporated the same facelift introduced in France earlier in the year, with a new grille and dashboard. The 1.4 engine had hitherto been reserved for the Swedish and Canadian markets and was equipped with various emissions controls equipment, allowing it to meet the new ADR27A emissions requirements. While heavier than the 1.3-liter Renault 12XL, power also increased by about ten percent, with torque figures up 13 percent. It produced a modest at 5750 rpm, with a maximum speed of 150 km/h and returned around 9 litres / 100 km in mixed driving. The Renault 1.4 saloon weighed , while the station wagon was somewhat heavier.

In May 1978 it was renamed again and became the Renault Virage. This was identical to the 12, with no changes to the engine or performance, but incorporated twin round headlamps. Production in Australia ended in 1980.

===New Zealand===
The Renault 12 was assembled from CKD kits at importer Campbell group&#x27;s own assembly plant in Thames, New Zealand, which later became a Toyota NZ factory and is now used to recondition used cars imported from Japan. The Campbell-built 12s had about 50 percent local content (glass, upholstery, tyres, carpet, paint, radiator, battery, etc.). One trim level was available and both sedans and wagons were made.

===Yugoslavia===
In 1972, Renault made a strategical partnership with Yugoslav manufacturer IMV from Novo Mesto, SR Slovenia, which had earlier been producing several Austin Motor Company models, to start producing besides Renault 4, also the Renault 12, Renault 16, Renault 18 and Renault 5 for the Yugoslav market.

===North America===
In Canada, the Renault 12 was assembled locally by SoMA in Québec from CKD kits from 1970 until summer 1973. The first two years&#x27; production the cars had small side marker lights, rectangular Cibié headlamps and the 60 HP SAE gross 1289 cc engine with single barrel Solex carb. La Presse newspaper reported in 1970 that a few 12 Gordinis were also imported to Canada before the stricter 1972 emission controls kicked in. From then on, the Renault 12 was imported fully built-up from France, and equipped with the 1647 cc all aluminium engine and 4 150 mm sealed beam headlights. Starting in late 1977, Canada received a 1.4-liter engine, the same as was also used in Sweden, to meet more stringent emissions standards than those used in most European markets. Power was SAE Gross at 5000 rpm. The R12 sold in Canada was available in base, L, TL, or GTL versions, as well as a Station Wagon (largely equivalent to the TL trim). The L, TL, and Station Wagon were also available with the automatic transmission. In total, 25,662 Renault 12 were sold in Canada: 1477 basic models from 1973-1976; 3935 12L models between 1970 and 1976; 10,270 12 TL/GTL models between 1970 and 1976; 1731 12L Automatics between 1971 and 1976; 2004 12TL Automatics between 1971 and 1976; 4029 R12 Station Wagons between 1971 and 1976; 1300 R12 Automatic Station Wagons between 1971 and 1976; and finally only 916 R12 Nordic sedans and station wagons in 1977-1979. The foregoing data from M.C. Fertey, former head of Renault Canada Ltée does not include figures by model for 1978, but roughly 900 R12 Nordics were likely sold that year. The Canada-only &quot;Nordic&quot; special edition was available in 1978 and 1979, and played up the commonalities between the Canadian and Scandinavian markets. Period advertising made mention of the shared 1.4-liter engine and offering Scandinavian-market equipment such as headlight washers and Finnish-developed aluminum front inner fenders. This version was only available in Metallic Blue, with mock-wood trim on the Station Wagon model. Sales the last few years were desultory, with 654 Renault 12s sold in Canada in 1979, 225 in 1980, and a final 37 cars delivered in 1981.

The United States-market Renault 12 was presented in the Bois de Boulogne in May 1971, followed by a presentation to American Renault dealers at the Doral Country Club, near Miami, shortly thereafter. The federalized R12 originally only came as a TL sedan or a Station Wagon (the first wagon to be sold by Renault in the US), but later a plain base version and the 12 L trim lines were added. They ranged in price from the introductory US$ 2195 to US$4498 for the final Station Wagon. US models differ in their quad headlamps and side marker lights, as well as by having a bump in the bonnet to clear the larger engine and its associated emissions hardware.

The 12 was a slightly larger car than most European imports, and the longitudinal front wheel drive layout contrasted with most. The engine, an all-aluminum 1565 cc unit with steel cylinder liners was shared with the Renault 16 and was specific to the U.S. market, although the 12 received a double-barrel Solex carburettor and slightly more power. Power was originally SAE at 5000 rpm with a 8.6:1 compression ratio. For 1973, the engine was upgraded to the larger 1647 cc version with a single-barrel carburettor, featuring hemispherical heads, although power decreased to at the same engine speed as emissions regulations were tightened. For 1974, the compression ratio was dropped to 7.5:1, with power slipping to . For the 1976 model year a two-barrel carburettor and a somewhat higher compression ratio meant that were on offer, while a more luxurious GTL model topped the lineup. Sales were marginal due to the growing popularity of Japanese imports, with their growing reputation of dependability and cost effective operation. The Renault 12 was introduced late in the 1971 model year, with sales continuing through 1977.

===South America===

In Brazil, a version of the 12 was sold as the Ford Corcel and later the Ford Del Rey, when Ford do Brasil acquired the factory and rights to build the car from Willys-Overland, which had jointly developed the Brazilian version with Renault in the late 1960s. The Corcel was in fact launched in Brazil in 1968, before the Renault 12 was launched in France.
The Renault 12 was popular in Argentina and Colombia, during the 1970s and 1980s. In Colombia, this car was assembled at the plant of Renault SOFASA between 1973 and 1981, from CKDs that came from Argentina and France. In Argentina, the local versions being made at the &quot;Santa Isabel&quot; plant of Renault Argentina in the province of Córdoba. Production ran from November 1971 to the same month of 1994. The Break was built from 1973 to 1992; the total of both bodystyles was around 450,000 units.

Drivetrains began as 1,289 cc, switching effectively to 1,397 cc for all versions in 1977, with a last increase in bore and stroke in 1992 reaching 1,565 cc. In Brazil, Ford offered a similar 1,555 cc version with its Corcel II in 1980, which later offered an ethanol version of this engine with a 12:1 compression ratio. Gearboxes were four-speed manuals until 1988, and five-speed boxes thereafter. The R12 had a slightly higher status in this country than other places, given the fact that the Argentine Renault cars lineup was narrow at the time (R4, R6 and Renault Torino). This caused the factory to add extras such as air conditioning and quality upholstery to close the gap between this car and the Torino until the arrival of the R18 in 1982. For this same reason, virtually all of the estate models &quot;(Break)&quot; were built with the TS&#x27;s mechanical and comfort features.

The Argentine Renault 12 also saw competition success in South America, with a celebrated class (up to 1,600 cc) win in the 1978 South American Marathon with Argentinian driver Jorge Recalde and co-driver Jorge Baruscotti. Recalde finished before any of the cars in the two-litre category, and Renault 12s occupied the first six positions in their category.

;Renault 12 Alpine
The R12 Alpine was a sports version designed to improve the marque&#x27;s image at local rallying. The main features were the 1397 cc engine from the R5 Alpine (built locally with imported parts), bulbous fiberglass bonnet, competition-tuned suspension, and custom paint schemes. The engine turned out , giving the Alpine a top speed of around . The new suspension was also as good as the power plant, being rated at the time as &quot;outstanding&quot; and &quot;Goes like on rails&quot; &quot;(CORSA Magazine)&quot;. Renault was not interested in volume production, though, and only 493 units were made between 1977 and 1980 (sold from 1978 onwards). Plus, the Alpine&#x27;s hand-building process and imported parts made it cost about 40% more than the basic TL version. R12 Alpine parts were sometimes used by rallying R12 TS&#x27;s, as they gave the car quite desirable characteristics but, like the R12 Alpine itself, these parts were rare.

<doc id="662173" wikidata="Q1148064" url="?curid=662173" title="Endoskeleton">
<text>An endoskeleton (From Ancient Greek ἔνδον, éndon = &quot;within&quot;, &quot;inner&quot; + σκελετός, skeletos = &quot;skeleton&quot;) is a structural frame (skeleton) on the inside of an animal, overlaid by soft tissues and usually composed of mineralized tissue. Endoskeletons serve as structural support against gravity and mechanical loads, and provide anchoring attachment sites for skeletal muscles to transmit force and allow movements and locomotion.
Vertebrates and the closely related cephalochordates are the predominant animal clade with endoskeletons (made of mostly bone and sometimes cartilage), although invertebrates such as sponges also have evolved a form of &quot;rebar&quot; endoskeletons made of diffuse meshworks of calcite/silica structural elements called spicules, and echinoderms have a dermal calcite endoskeleton known as ossicles. Some coleoid cephalopods (squids and cuttlefish) have an internalized vestigial aragonite/calcite-chitin shell known as gladius or cuttlebone, which can serve as muscle attachments but the main function is often to maintain buoyancy rather than to give structural support, and their body shape is largely maintained by hydroskeleton.

Compared to the exoskeletons of many invertebrates, endoskeletons allow much larger overall body sizes for the same skeletal mass, as most soft tissues and organs are positioned &quot;outside&quot; the skeleton rather than within it, thus unrestricted by the volume and internal capacity of the skeleton itself. Being more centralized in structure also means more compact volume, making it easier for the circulatory system to perfuse and oxygenate, as well as higher tissue density against stress. The external nature of muscle attachments also allows thicker and more diverse muscle architectures, as well as more versatile range of motions.

A true endoskeleton is derived from mesodermal tissue. In three phyla of animals, Chordata, Echinodermata and Porifera (sponges), endoskeletons of various complexity are found. An endoskeleton may function purely for structural support (as in the case of Porifera), but often also serves as an attachment site for muscles and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces as in chordates and echinoderms, which provides a means of locomotion.

Compared to the exoskeleton structure in many invertebrates (particularly panarthropods), the endoskeleton has several advantages:
* The capacity for larger body sizes under the same skeletal mass, as the endoskeleton has a &quot;flesh-over-bone&quot; construct rather than a &quot;flesh-in-bone&quot; one as in exoskeletons. This means that the body&#x27;s overall volume is not restricted by the endoskeleton itself, but by the weight of soft tissues that can be attached and supported by it, while the capacity of an exoskeleton&#x27;s internal cavity restricts how much organs and tissues can be supported. Because of skeletal rigidity, many invertebrates have to repeatedly moult (ecdysis) during the juvenile stages of life to grow bigger.
* Endoskeletons have a more concentrated layout due to its internalized nature, so a greater proportion of skeletal tissue can be recruited to handle mechanical loads. In contrast, exoskeletons are more &quot;spread thin&quot; over the exterior, meaning that when stress is applied to one area of the body, most of the remaining exoskeleton often just plays &quot;dead weight&quot;. Increasing the skeletal strength of a local area often means having to increase the cuticle thickness and density of an entire part of the body, which increase the overall weight significantly, especially with larger body sizes.
* Being internal means the skeletal tissue can be perfused and maintained from both inside (via nutrient arteries of the marrow) and outside (via periosteal arterioles). The tissue catchment volume that the circulatory system is required to cover is also smaller than that of exoskeletons, making it easier to maintain skeletal health.
* Endoskeletons are typically cushioned from trauma by the overlying soft tissues, while exoskeletons are directly exposed to external insults.
* Having other tissues attached outside the skeleton means that endoskeletons can have a more diverse muscular layouts as well as bigger physiological cross-sectional area, which translates to greater contractile strength and adaptability. Having external muscles also means the potential for greater leverage as the muscle can attach further down from a joint (comparatively, exoskeletal muscles cannot attach farther than the internal diameter of the corresponding joint cavity), although the muscles (especially flexors) themselves can sometimes physically hinder the joint&#x27;s range of motion.

=== Chordates ===

Chordates, with the exception of the subphylum Tunicata (which are either soft-bodied or are supported by an exoskeleton known as a test), are developed along an axial endoskeleton. In the more basal subphylum Cephalochordata (lancelets), the endoskeleton consists of solely of an elastic glycoprotein-collagen rod called notochord, which stores energy like a spring and enable more energy-efficient swimming. In the crown group subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates), the endoskeleton is greatly expanded, with the notochord replaced by a segmented vertebral column and the skeletal elements develop further to form the cranium, rib cage and appendicular skeleton. The vertebrate endoskeleton is made up of two types of mineralized tissues, i.e. bone and cartilage, reinforced by collagenous ligaments. Vertebrates also evolved specialized striated muscles over their endoskeletons called skeletal muscles, which have serialized sarcomeres and parallel myofibrils bundled in fascicles to both generate greater force and optimize contraction speed.

=== Echinoderms ===
Echinoderms have a mesodermal skeleton in the dermis, composed of calcite-based plates known as ossicles, which form a porous structure known as stereom. In sea urchins, the ossicles are fused together into a test, while in the arms of sea stars, brittle stars and crinoids (sea lilies) they articulate to form flexible joints. The ossicles may bear external projections in the form of spines, granules or warts that are supported by a tough epidermis. Echinoderm skeletal elements are sometimes deployed in specialized ways such as the chewing organ in sea urchins called &quot;Aristotle&#x27;s lantern&quot;, the supportive stalks of crinoids, and the structural &quot;lime ring&quot; of sea cucumbers.

=== Sponges===
The poriferan &quot;skeleton&quot; consists of mesh-like network of microscopic spicules. The soft connective tissues of sponges are composed of gelatinous mesohyl reinforced by fibrous spongin, forming a composite matrix that has decent tensile strength but severely lacks the rigidity needed to resist deformation from ocean currents. The spicules act as structural elements that add much needed compressive and shear strengths that help maintain the sponge&#x27;s shape (which is needed to ensure optimal filter feeding), much like the aggregates and rebar stirrups within reinforced concrete. Sponges can have spicules made of calcium carbonate (calcite or aragonite) or more commonly silica, which separate sponges into two main clades, calcareous sponges and siliceous sponges. There are however species (such as bath sponge and lake sponge) that have no or severely reduced spicules, which gives them an overall soft &quot;spongy&quot; structure.

=== Coleoids ===
The Coleoidea, a subclass of cephalopod molluscs who evolved internalised shell, do not have a true endoskeleton in the physiological sense; there, the internal shell has evolved into a buoyancy organ called the gladius or cuttlebone, which may provide muscle attachment but does &quot;not&quot; support the cephalopod&#x27;s body shape (which is maintained solely by a hydroskeleton).

<doc id="662174" wikidata="Q1616270" url="?curid=662174" title="Heterojunction">
<text>A heterojunction is an interface between two layers or regions of dissimilar semiconductors. These semiconducting materials have unequal band gaps as opposed to a homojunction. It is often advantageous to engineer the electronic energy bands in many solid-state device applications, including semiconductor lasers, solar cells and transistors. The combination of multiple heterojunctions together in a device is called a heterostructure, although the two terms are commonly used interchangeably. The requirement that each material be a semiconductor with unequal band gaps is somewhat loose, especially on small length scales, where electronic properties depend on spatial properties. A more modern definition of heterojunction is the interface between any two solid-state materials, including crystalline and amorphous structures of metallic, insulating, fast ion conductor and semiconducting materials.

== Manufacture and applications ==

Heterojunction manufacturing generally requires the use of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies in order to precisely control the deposition thickness and create a cleanly lattice-matched abrupt interface. A recent alternative under research is the mechanical stacking of layered materials into van der Waals heterostructures.

Despite their expense, heterojunctions have found use in a variety of specialized applications where their unique characteristics are critical:
* &quot;Solar cells&quot;: Heterojunctions are formed through the interface of a crystalline silicon substrate (band gap 1.1 eV) and amorphous silicon thin film (band gap 1.7 eV) in some solar cell architectures. The heterojunction is used to separate charge carriers in a similar way to a p–n junction. The Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin-Layer (HIT) solar cell structure was first developed in 1983 and commercialised by Sanyo/Panasonic. HIT solar cells now hold the record for the most efficient single-junction silicon solar cell, with a conversion efficiency of 26.7%.
* &quot;Lasers&quot;: Using heterojunctions in lasers was first proposed in 1963 when Herbert Kroemer, a prominent scientist in this field, suggested that population inversion could be greatly enhanced by heterostructures. By incorporating a smaller direct band gap material like GaAs between two larger band gap layers like AlAs, carriers can be confined so that lasing can occur at room temperature with low threshold currents. It took many years for the material science of heterostructure fabrication to catch up with Kroemer&#x27;s ideas but now it is the industry standard. It was later discovered that the band gap could be controlled by taking advantage of the quantum size effects in quantum well heterostructures. Furthermore, heterostructures can be used as waveguides to the index step which occurs at the interface, another major advantage to their use in semiconductor lasers. Semiconductor diode lasers used in CD and DVD players and fiber optic transceivers are manufactured using alternating layers of various III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors to form lasing heterostructures.
* &quot;Bipolar transistors&quot;: When a heterojunction is used as the base-emitter junction of a bipolar junction transistor, extremely high forward gain and low reverse gain result. This translates into very good high frequency operation (values in tens to hundreds of GHz) and low leakage currents. This device is called a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT).
* &quot;Field effect transistors&quot;: Heterojunctions are used in high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) which can operate at significantly higher frequencies (over 500 GHz). The proper doping profile and band alignment gives rise to extremely high electron mobilities by creating a two dimensional electron gas within a dopant free region where very little scattering can occur.
* &quot;Catalysis&quot;: Using heterojuntions as photocatalyst has demonstrated that they exhibit better performance in CO2 photoreduction, H2 production and photodegradation of pollutants in water than single metal oxides. The performance of the heterojunction can be further improved by incorporation of oxygen vacancies, crystal facet engineering or incorporation of carbonaceous materials.

== Energy band alignment ==


The behaviour of a semiconductor junction depends crucially on the alignment of the energy bands at the interface.
Semiconductor interfaces can be organized into three types of heterojunctions: straddling gap (type I), staggered gap (type II) or broken gap (type III) as seen in the figure. Away from the junction, the band bending can be computed based on the usual procedure of solving Poisson&#x27;s equation.

Various models exist to predict the band alignment.
* The simplest (and least accurate) model is Anderson&#x27;s rule, which predicts the band alignment based on the properties of vacuum-semiconductor interfaces (in particular the vacuum electron affinity). The main limitation is its neglect of chemical bonding.
* A &quot;common anion rule&quot; was proposed which guesses that since the valence band is related to anionic states, materials with the same anions should have very small valence band offsets. This however did not explain the data but is related to the trend that two materials with different anions tend to have larger valence band offsets than conduction band offsets. 
* Tersoff proposed a &quot;gap state&quot; model based on more familiar metal–semiconductor junctions where the conduction band offset is given by the difference in Schottky barrier height. This model includes a dipole layer at the interface between the two semiconductors which arises from electron tunneling from the conduction band of one material into the gap of the other (analogous to metal-induced gap states). This model agrees well with systems where both materials are closely lattice matched such as GaAs/AlGaAs.
* The &quot;60:40 rule&quot; is a heuristic for the specific case of junctions between the semiconductor GaAs and the alloy semiconductor Al&quot;x&quot;Ga1−&quot;x&quot;As. As the &quot;x&quot; in the Al&quot;x&quot;Ga1−&quot;x&quot;As side is varied from 0 to 1, the ratio formula_1 tends to maintain the value 60/40. For comparison, Anderson&#x27;s rule predicts formula_2 for a GaAs/AlAs junction (&quot;x&quot;=1).

The typical method for measuring band offsets is by calculating them from measuring exciton energies in the luminescence spectra.

== Effective mass mismatch ==

When a heterojunction is formed by two different semiconductors, a quantum well can be fabricated due to difference in band structure. In order to calculate the static energy levels within the achieved quantum well, understanding variation or mismatch of the effective mass across the heterojunction becomes substantial. The quantum well defined in the heterojunction can be treated as a finite well potential with width of formula_3. In addition, in 1966, Conley et al. and BenDaniel and Duke reported a boundary condition for the envelope function in a quantum well, known as BenDaniel–Duke boundary condition. According to them, the envelope function in a fabricated quantum well must satisfy a boundary condition which states that formula_4 and formula_5 are both continuous in interface regions.
Using the Schrödinger equation for a finite well with width of formula_6and center at 0, the equation for the achieved quantum well can be written as:

::formula_7
::formula_8
::formula_9

Solution for above equations are well-known, only with different(modified) k and formula_10 

::formula_11.

At the z = formula_12 even-parity solution can be gained from
::formula_13.

By taking derivative of (5) and multiplying both sides by formula_14

::formula_15.

Dividing (6) by (5), even-parity solution function can be obtained,

::formula_16.

Similarly, for odd-parity solution,

::formula_17.

For numerical solution, taking derivatives of (7) and (8) gives

even parity:
::formula_18
odd parity:
::formula_19

where formula_20.

The difference in effective mass between materials results in a larger difference in ground state energies.
== Nanoscale heterojunctions ==
In quantum dots the band energies are dependent on crystal size due to the quantum size effects. This enables band offset engineering in nanoscale heterostructures. It is possible to use the same materials but change the type of junction, say from straddling (type I) to staggered (type II), by changing the size or thickness of the crystals involved. The most common nanoscale heterostructure system is ZnS on CdSe (CdSe@ZnS) which has a straddling gap (type I) offset. In this system the much larger band gap ZnS passivates the surface of the fluorescent CdSe core thereby increasing the quantum efficiency of the luminescence. There is an added bonus of increased thermal stability due to the stronger bonds in the ZnS shell as suggested by its larger band gap. Since CdSe and ZnS both grow in the zincblende crystal phase and are closely lattice matched, core shell growth is preferred. In other systems or under different growth conditions it may be possible to grow anisotropic structures such as the one seen in the image on the right.

The driving force for charge transfer between conduction bands in these structures is the conduction band offset. By decreasing the size of CdSe nanocrystals grown on TiO2, Robel et al. found that electrons transferred faster from the higher CdSe conduction band into TiO2. In CdSe the quantum size effect is much more pronounced in the conduction band due to the smaller effective mass than in the valence band, and this is the case with most semiconductors. Consequently, engineering the conduction band offset is typically much easier with nanoscale heterojunctions. For staggered (type II) offset nanoscale heterojunctions, photoinduced charge separation can occur since there the lowest energy state for holes may be on one side of the junction whereas the lowest energy for electrons is on the opposite side. It has been suggested that anisotropic staggered gap (type II) nanoscale heterojunctions may be used for photocatalysis, specifically for water splitting with solar energy.

<doc id="662175" wikidata="Q367849" url="?curid=662175" title="Silicon–germanium">
<text>SiGe ( or ), or silicon–germanium, is an alloy with any molar ratio of silicon and germanium, i.e. with a molecular formula of the form Si1−&quot;x&quot;Ge&quot;x&quot;. It is commonly used as a semiconductor material in integrated circuits (ICs) for heterojunction bipolar transistors or as a strain-inducing layer for CMOS transistors. IBM introduced the technology into mainstream manufacturing in 1989. This relatively new technology offers opportunities in mixed-signal circuit and analog circuit IC design and manufacture. SiGe is also used as a thermoelectric material for high-temperature applications (&gt;700 K).

==History==
The first paper on SiGe was published in 1955 on the magnetoresistance of silicon germanium alloys
. The first mention of SiGe devices was actually in the original patent for the bipolar transistor where the idea of a SiGe base in a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) was discussed with a description of the physics in the 1957. The first epitaxial growth of SiGe heterostructures which is required for a transistor was not demonstrated until 1975 by Erich Kasper and colleagues at the AEG Research Centre (now Daimler Benz) in Ulm, Germany using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).

==Production==
The use of silicon–germanium as a semiconductor was championed by Bernie Meyerson. 
The challenge that had delayed its realization for decades was that germanium atoms are roughly 4% larger than silicon atoms. At the usual high temperatures at which silicon transistors were fabricated, the strain induced by adding these larger atoms into crystalline silicon produced vast numbers of defects, precluding the resulting material being of any use. Meyerson and co-workers discovered that the then believed requirement for high temperature processing was flawed, allowing SiGe growth at sufficiently low temperatures such that for all practical purposes no defects were formed. Once having resolved that basic roadblock, it was shown that resultant SiGe materials could be manufactured into high performance electronics using conventional low cost silicon processing toolsets. More relevant, the performance of resulting transistors far exceeded what was then thought to be the limit of traditionally manufactured silicon devices, enabling a new generation of low cost commercial wireless technologies such as WiFi. SiGe processes achieve costs similar to those of silicon CMOS manufacturing and are lower than those of other heterojunction technologies such as gallium arsenide. Recently, organogermanium precursors (e.g. isobutylgermane, alkylgermanium trichlorides, and dimethylaminogermanium trichloride) have been examined as less hazardous liquid alternatives to germane for MOVPE deposition of Ge-containing films such as high purity Ge, SiGe, and strained silicon.

SiGe foundry services are offered by several semiconductor technology companies. AMD disclosed a joint development with IBM for a SiGe stressed-silicon technology, targeting the 65 nm process. TSMC also sells SiGe manufacturing capacity.

In July 2015, IBM announced that it had created working samples of transistors using a 7 nm silicon–germanium process, promising a quadrupling in the amount of transistors compared to a contemporary process.

==SiGe transistors==

SiGe allows CMOS logic to be integrated with heterojunction bipolar transistors, making it suitable for mixed-signal integrated circuits. Heterojunction bipolar transistors have higher forward gain and lower reverse gain than traditional homojunction bipolar transistors. This translates into better low-current and high-frequency performance. Being a heterojunction technology with an adjustable band gap, the SiGe offers the opportunity for more flexible bandgap tuning than silicon-only technology.

Silicon–germanium on insulator (SGOI) is a technology analogous to the silicon on insulator (SOI) technology currently employed in computer chips. SGOI increases the speed of the transistors inside microchips by straining the crystal lattice under the MOS transistor gate, resulting in improved electron mobility and higher drive currents. SiGe MOSFETs can also provide lower junction leakage due to the lower bandgap value of SiGe. However, a major issue with SGOI MOSFETs is the inability to form stable oxides with silicon–germanium using standard silicon oxidation processing.

==Thermoelectric application==
The thermoelectric properties of SiGe was first measured in 1964 with p-SiGe having a ZT up to ~0.7 at 1000˚C and n-SiGe a ZT up to ~1.0 at 1000˚C which are some of the highest performance thermoelectrics at high temperatures. A silicon–germanium thermoelectric device MHW-RTG3 was used in the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft.
Silicon–germanium thermoelectric devices were also used in other MHW-RTGs and GPHS-RTGs aboard Cassini, Galileo, Ulysses.

==Light emission==
By controlling the composition of a hexagonal SiGe alloy, researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology developed a material that can emit light. In combination with its electronic properties, this opens up the possibility of producing a laser integrated into a single chip to enable data transfer using light instead of electric current, speeding up data transfer while reducing energy consumption and need for cooling systems. The international team, with lead authors Elham Fadaly, Alain Dijkstra and Erik Bakkers at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands and Jens Renè Suckert at Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena in Germany, were awarded the 2020 Breakthrough of the Year award by the magazine Physics World.

<text>The Renault Laguna is a large family car that was manufactured and marketed by Renault for 21 years in three body styles: hatchback, coupé, and estate. The first generation Laguna was launched in 1994, the second generation was introduced in 2000, and the third generation was built from October 2007 until 2015.

==Concept car==
The production Renault passenger models are unrelated to the concept car of the same name, the Laguna, a two-seater roadster presented by the automaker during the 1990 Paris Motor Show. The name was also previously used from 1973 to 1976 by Chevrolet, for a top-of-the-line Chevelle model, the Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna.

==First generation (X56; 1993)==
With development underway from 1987, design work under Patrick Le Quément began in 1988, with a final design approval in March 1989, and a design freeze by the beginning of 1990. Road testing commenced in 1991 and continued through 1993. The first generation Renault Laguna was unveiled in November 1993 and launched in January 1994. It was the replacement for the Renault 21, although it was initially only available as a hatchback.

At the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1995, an estate version was introduced. This was known in some markets as the Laguna Sports Tourer, and replaced the Renault 21 Nevada/Savanna. It was initially launched as a 1.8 RN/RT, 2.0 RT/RXE, and 3.0 V6. A sports pack with deep front spoiler, rear spoiler, and alloy wheels was available on 2.0 versions.

A limited-edition of 500 1.8 RT Sport was made available in 1996, one hundred each of five colours including a metallic blue normally reserved for 2.0 models. These limited editions sold out very quickly and so the RT Sport was incorporated into the standard range at a cheaper price but having ABS, air conditioning, CD/Radio, and high-level brake light added as standard (all these were options on the more expensive, original 500). This coincided with Renault&#x27;s participation in the British Touring Car Championship.

The Laguna&#x27;s equipment levels were generally much higher than the Renault 21. From launch, all models came with power steering, electric front windows, and remote central locking as standard. Most of the range had a driver&#x27;s airbag. Later twin airbags, an anti-lock braking system, air conditioning, and a CD player became either optional extras or standard equipment.

In September 1996, minor upgrades included a new &quot;Laguna&quot; nameplate at the rear.

===Engines===
===Facelift===
The Laguna received a moderate facelift in April 1998, including a restyling of the hatchback and the sports tourer versions, and a redesigned front. This also included a different facelifted design of the taillights, most noticeable are the circular fog lights in the front.

The engines were updated and, in some markets, equipment levels were enhanced again. Five new engines featured in the completed facelifted lineup:
* K4M 1.6 16v (109 hp)
* F4P 1.8 16v (120 hp)
* F3R 2.0 (114 hp)
* N7Q 2.0 S (140 hp)
* F4R 2.0 16v (139 hp)
* L7X 3.0 V6 24v (190 hp)
* F9Q turbo 1.9 dTi (turbocharged direct injection) (98 hp)
* F9Q turbo 1.9 dCi (turbocharged common rail direct injection) (107 hp)
* G8T turbo 2.2 dT (turbocharged indirect injection) (113 hp)

For 2000, the final edition of this Laguna, the &quot;Laguna Concorde&quot;, was introduced. It included semi-leather seats and vocal warnings like &quot;Welcome. The vehicle computer... is now checking systems for you&quot;. The onboard computer would notify the driver of any doors not being closed, lights left on, etc., weather (&quot;Please brake carefully the road is watery&quot;), or other faults in the electrical or mechanical circuits.

The onboard voice synthesizer warnings system was also available on the earlier 1998 RXE and V6 models. This is the same basic unit as used in the Renault Safrane.

The model of the Laguna Concorde was the last guise of the &quot;old&quot; Laguna to be marketed, prior to the release of the Laguna II at the end of 2000. The last of the Mk.1 Lagunas were registered in February 2001, and the Concorde range all feature a cream letter &quot;C&quot; on a dark green background. This was with the outline of an actual Concorde above the letter.
==Second generation (X74; 2000)==


After almost seven years in production, the original Laguna was replaced by an all new model in December 2000 for the 2001 model year. The engines were upgraded, and the equipment list made longer.

It was the first vehicle available in Europe to achieve five stars in the Euro NCAP crash test results, which was heavily promoted by Renault. The result was soon repeated in other models in Renault&#x27;s range. This generation was made available in hatchback or estate (Grandtour) styles only.

The Laguna was the first European family car, and the second European car to feature &quot;keyless&quot; entry and ignition, developed by Valeo. Instead of a key, it used a credit card style device to unlock the car and start the engine. The initial unreliability of this keyless system hurt Laguna&#x27;s reputation as well as Renault&#x27;s reputation in general. The styling of the second generation Laguna was heavily influenced by the Initiale concept car.

The Laguna II won the title Semperit Irish Car of the Year in November 2001.

The Laguna estate was only available with five seats, unlike the previous model which had seven seats as an option on some versions. It was badged as Sports Tourer or Grandtour, depending on the country. It was also marketed as a lifestyle vehicle, rather than a load carrier.

===Facelift===
The Laguna II was facelifted in March 2005, being launched in the AutoRAI in Amsterdam, according to Renault with improved security, driving performance, and comfort. It also had a moderate redesign of the air intake at the front of the car, now matching the design of the Megane. Sales commenced on 18 March 2005.

An electronic handbrake was also introduced, this was previously seen on the Scénic and Espace. The engines were much the same as before, with the 1.6 and 1.8 petrol units being offered in some markets, while other countries get a 2.0 petrol unit (turbo or non-turbo) and two diesels (1.9 or 2.2 direct injection).

After the facelift, a new diesel engine was introduced, the 2.0 dCi with and another variant of the engine which produced .

==Third generation (X91; 2007)==


The Renault Laguna III was officially announced in a press release on June 4, 2007. The car was unveiled to the public at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September, and it went on sale in October 2007 for the 2008 model year. The car comes as a five-door hatchback (B91), a five-door estate (K91), and for the first time a two-door coupé (D91).

This third generation is based on the platform D, shared with the Nissan Altima, the Nissan Teana, and the Nissan Murano. The Laguna III was the first car to have gone through the Aubevoye Technical Centre&#x27;s &quot;Electro Magnetic Compatibility&quot; unit, in the course of its development.

The coupé version was first presented as a concept car, at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show, which followed some styling cues of the previous concept car, the Renault Fluence. The production version was revealed at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, coinciding with the Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix to take the wraps off.

The brand new V6 dCi engine delivers 235 hp (173 kW), while the new 3.5 litre petrol powered V6 offers 240 hp (175 kW). The Laguna Coupé later appeared before the general public at the Paris Motor Show in October 2008. In January 2008, spy images of a then possible Laguna Sedan appeared on the internet.

It was expected the car having appeared at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. However, this never made it to production. The Renault Latitude and the third generation (L43) Renault Samsung SM5, which is made by Renault Samsung Motors, South Korea is based on the Laguna III.

===Facelift===
A facelifted version of the Laguna III, called the Phase 2, débuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show, and sales began in November 2010.

It has an aggressive front end compared to the older model. The range has been redesigned around six trim levels: Expression, Black Edition, Eco Business, Bose, GT 4Control, and Initiale. Engine side, the only change is the engine 1.5 dCi 110 hp, with emissions, decreased from 130 to 120g/km.

In February 2012, Renault discontinued the Laguna, Espace, Kangoo, Modus, and Wind lines in the United Kingdom. In 2015, both the Laguna and the Latitude were replaced by the Talisman. 54,840 Laguna Coupé have been produced out of total 351,384.

==Successor==
Renault was rumoured considering changing the Laguna name to Atalans for the successor. In May 2015, &quot;Worldcarfans&quot; reported the successor would première on July 6, 2015, and would also replace the Latitude in the European market. The coupé version would also be discontinued, due to low demand. On 6 July 2015, Renault announced the successor will be called Talisman, as part of its intention of unifying nameplates worldwide.

<doc id="662177" wikidata="Q1789199" url="?curid=662177" title="Christian Democrats (Denmark)">
<text>The Christian Democrats (, KD) are a political party in Denmark. The party was founded in April 1970 as the Christian People&#x27;s Party (, KrF) to oppose the liberalization of restrictions on pornography and the legalization of abortion. The party renamed itself to its current name in 2003. Originally, the party was not considered part of the European Christian-democratic tradition, and it was better known as a religious conservative party.

The Christian Democrats are a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and the Centrist Democrat International.

==History==
The party was formed in 1970. Since its inception, the party has enjoyed an intermittent presence in the Parliament of Denmark, rarely winning much more than the two percent minimum required to gain seats under Denmark&#x27;s proportional representation system, and frequently falling below the threshold, as has happened in every election from the 2005 parliamentary election onwards. Despite its small size, the party has served in a number of coalition governments. From 1982 to 1988, it was in coalition with the Liberal Party, Conservative People&#x27;s Party and Centre Democrats; from 1993 to 1994, it served in government with the Social Democrats, the Social Liberals and the Centre Democrats.


From 2002 to 2005, the party was led by Marianne Karlsmose. The name of the party was changed to the Christian Democrats in 2003. In October 2005, the party elected Bodil Kornbek as its new chairman. Her attempt to introduce a more secular centre-left profile had some success in the beginning, but the party once again failed to win seats in the 2007 elections. In October 2008, Kornbek was replaced by Bjarne Hartung Kirkegaard from its more conservative and religious wing.

In 2010, the Christian Democrats regained parliamentary representation when the Independent former Conservative MP Per Ørum Jørgensen joined the party. Since he was not formerly known for having expressed opinions based on Christianity, these events once more softened the religious character of the party.

On 30 June 2011, it was announced that the Christian Democrats had started cooperating with Fælleslisten, a single-issue party fighting for decentralization, especially in health care policy, with some success in regional and local elections. This means that candidates from the two parties appeared on a joint list at the 2011 Danish parliamentary election. The Christian Democrats had themselves taken a somewhat regionalist stance at a moment when Fælleslisten had surged in opinion polls.

In September 2012, Per Ørum Jørgensen resigned and subsequently left the party altogether in order to form a new party called the Democratic Party. Egon Jakobsen was appointed as interim chairman, and on 27 October 2012, the former deputy chairman Stig Grenov was elected as new chairman.

The 2015 general election marked the first election with Stig Grenov as chairman. Although Grenov managed to make his mark during the campaign, it only resulted in slightly over 1000 more votes than four years earlier.

The municipal and regional elections of 2017 saw a slight increase for the party, with the number of elected municipal council members rising from six to nine. Former national chairman Marianne Karlsmose was elected as a member of the regional council in the Central Denmark Region. However, the party failed to secure a mayor&#x27;s position in Ringkøbing-Skjern Municipality.

Six days prior to the 2019 general election, Stig Grenov took temporary leave from his position as party chairman due to stress. Vice-chair Isabella Arendt stepped in as acting party chairman, initially for a month, but Grenov&#x27;s leave was subsequently extended until the party&#x27;s congress in October 2019, where Isabella Arendt formally became the new chairman.

Despite more than doubling the number of votes from 2015, the party was not represented in the Danish Parliament in the 2019 election. Less than 200 votes separated the party from securing a constituency mandate in West Jutland.

In 2021, Jens Rohde joined the party, resulting in its representation in the Folketing once again.

For the party, 2022 was characterized by several prominent figures retiring from national politics. In January, Kristian Andersen, the party&#x27;s top vote-getter in the West Jutland constituency, announced that he would not run for the next parliament; the same was announced by Jens Rohde in May. Less than two weeks later, Isabella Arendt resigned from the chairmanship and left the party. Marianne Karlsmose then assumed the role of acting national chairman, and in October, she was officially elected as chairman without any opposing candidates. In the general election on November 1, the Christian Democrats received 0,5% of the votes and thus did not enter the Folketing. On November 12, Karlsmose resigned from the chairman position. Instead of electing a new chairman, the party&#x27;s executive committee agreed to have Karlsmose replaced by organizational and political vice-chairmen, Jesper Housgaard and Henrik Hjortshøj, respectively, until the party&#x27;s annual meeting in 2023. However, an extraordinary congress was held in March 2023, where Jeppe Hedaa was elected as the new national chairman.

<text>The American Discovery Trail is a system of recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast hiking and biking trail across the mid-tier of the United States. Horses can also be ridden on most of this trail. The coastal trailheads are the Delmarva Peninsula on the Atlantic Ocean and the northern California coast on the Pacific Ocean. The trail has northern and southern alternates for part of its distance, passing through Chicago and St. Louis respectively. The total length of the trail, including both the north and south routes, is . The northern route covers with the southern route covering . It is the only non-motorized coast-to-coast trail.

The trail passes through 14 national parks and 16 national forests and uses sections of or connects to five National Scenic Trails, 10 National Historic Trails, and 23 National Recreation Trails. For part of its distance, it is coincident with the North Country Trail, the Buckeye Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Colorado Trail.

==Hiking records==

Joyce and Pete Cottrell, of Whitefield, New Hampshire, were the first to backpack the entire official route of the American Discovery Trail. They hiked the segments out of sequence over two calendar years, finishing in 2003.

The first hikers to complete the trail in one continuous walk were Marcia and Ken Powers, a wife and husband team from Pleasanton, California. Their trail walk lasted from February 27 to October 15, 2005. They started out from Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware and ended at Point Reyes, California. They traveled by foot, averaging a day.

The first person to backpack the entire (including both Northern and Southern sections) in one continuous hike was Mike &quot;Lion King&quot; Daniel. He started from Cape Henlopen State Park on June 17, 2007, and ended at Point Reyes, California, on November 5, 2008. The first woman to backpack the entire 6,800 miles (10,944 km) solo in one continuous hike was Briana DeSanctis. She started on January 1, 2022, and ended her journey on February 10, 2024.

The first person to cover the entire equestrian route on horseback was Matt Parker. He undertook the journey between May 2003 and November 2005.

==Notable locations==
At Cedar Rapids, a mural was posted on Greene Square in 2019 to mark both the American Discovery Trail, which passes through downtown, and the Cedar Lake-Smokestack Bridge project.

<text>In mathematics, the irrational base discrete weighted transform (IBDWT) is a variant of the fast Fourier transform using an irrational base; it was developed by Richard Crandall (Reed College), Barry Fagin (Dartmouth College) and Joshua Doenias (NeXT Software) in the early 1990s using Mathematica.

The IBDWT is used in the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search&#x27;s client Prime95 to perform FFT multiplication, as well as in other programs implementing Lucas–Lehmer test, such as CUDALucas and Glucas.

<text>A federal prison is operated under the jurisdiction of a federal government as opposed to a state or provincial body. Federal prisons are used for people who violated federal law (U.S., Mexico), people considered dangerous (Brazil), or those sentenced to longer terms of imprisonment (Canada). Not all federated countries have a legal concept of &quot;federal prison&quot;.

==Australia==
The Australian Federal Government does not directly control most prisons or detention facilities. There are a relatively small number of federal detention facilities, consisting of military detention facilities (such as the Defence Force Correctional Establishment), immigration detention facilities, and holding cells in Australian Federal Police stations in some territories.

The vast majority of criminal prosecutions in Australia take place within state or territory court systems under state or territory law, however there are a relatively small number of prosecutions in state and federal courts under federal law (such as the Crimes Act 1914).

Section 120 of the Constitution of Australia provides that:

Every State shall make provision for the detention in its prisons of persons accused or convicted of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, and for the punishment of persons convicted of such offences, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws to give effect to this provision.

Accordingly, civilian federal offenders who are remanded in custody, or have been sentenced to imprisonment, are detained in state or territory prisons.

==Brazil==
The Brazil federal prison system (Sistema Penitenciário Federal) was implemented in 2006 based on the provisions of the 1984 law &quot;Lei de Execução Penal&quot;. It receives the most dangerous criminals who would be disruptive in state prisons.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Correctional Service of Canada operates federal penitentiaries, which house inmates with sentences of two years or more; provincial prisons are responsible for those with shorter terms.

==Germany==
The prisons in Germany are run solely by the federal states, although governed by a federal law.

==Mexico==
The federal prison system in Mexico is run by the Secretariat of Public Security and receives prisoners sentenced and being processed for federal crimes.

==Russia==
All penal establishments in the Russian Federation are governed by the Federal Penitentiary Service.

==United States==

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), established with the passing of the Three Prisons Act of 1891, is responsible for the administration of federal prison facilities in the United States, as well as the custody and welfare of federal inmates. The BOP also provides researchers with background information and statistics regarding the Federal Prison System.

<text>Glen A. Hanlon (born February 20, 1957) is a Canadian ice hockey coach, executive and former goaltender.

Hanlon played in the National Hockey League for the Vancouver Canucks, St. Louis Blues, New York Rangers and the Detroit Red Wings. He is also former head coach of the Washington Capitals of the NHL, Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), the Slovakia national ice hockey team, the Belarusian national ice hockey team and the Swiss national ice hockey team. He was also a goaltender scout for the Vancouver Canucks.

==Playing career==
Hanlon was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft, in the third round (40th overall pick). He played for the Vancouver Canucks, St. Louis Blues, New York Rangers and Detroit Red Wings in the NHL, as well as the WCHL, Central Hockey League, AHL and IHL.

In 1978, he won the Central Hockey League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year.

On October 14, 1979, Hanlon allowed the first career NHL goal scored by Wayne Gretzky, who would eventually become the NHL&#x27;s all-time scoring leader. Hanlon has been quoted as saying &quot;I created a monster&quot; in reference to allowing Gretzky&#x27;s first goal.

==Coaching career==
Hanlon has served as the assistant coach for both the Canucks and Washington Capitals before becoming the head coach of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Portland Pirates and then the Capitals. After a miserable start to the 2003–04 season, Capitals general manager George McPhee fired head coach Bruce Cassidy and promoted assistant Hanlon to head coaching duties. The Capitals went 15–30–9 under Hanlon to finish the year. Led by 2004 first-round pick Alexander Ovechkin, the Capitals were expected to improve; however the team was still young and compiled a record of 29–41–12. Despite this, Hanlon was guaranteed one more year as coach of the Capitals. In 2005, he was assigned to coach the Belarus hockey team. He led the team to 10th place at the 2005 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships, and to historic high sixth place at the 2006 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships. He was named &quot;sports man of the year&quot; by major Belarusian sports newspaper &quot;Прессбол&quot; in 2006. The 2006–07 Capitals compiled an 8–5–4 mark by the end of November, though long losing streaks eliminated the Caps&#x27; chances of making the post-season, as they finished 28–40–14.

Over the 2007 offseason, McPhee signed many talented players including Michael Nylander, Tom Poti, Viktor Kozlov and young Swedish star Nicklas Bäckström, elevating expectations in Washington. In the season&#x27;s first week, the Capitals jumped to a 3–0 record but went on to lose 15 of the next 18 games (3–14–1), which lead to Hanlon&#x27;s dismissal. McPhee stated that Hanlon had lost control of the team, so he elected to replace Hanlon with Bruce Boudreau, the head coach of the AHL&#x27;s Hershey Bears. Immediately after Hanlon&#x27;s exit, the Capitals won against the high-flying Philadelphia Flyers and Carolina Hurricanes. The team finished 37–17–7 the rest of the way in 2007–2008, notching their first division title since 2000–01. Following his dismissal, Hanlon accepted an offer by the Capitals to act as a scout based in the Washington, D.C. area. On February 14, 2008, it was announced that Hanlon would be the head coach of Finnish SM-Liiga team Jokerit.

On March 24, 2010, Glen Hanlon was announced as a new head coach of the Slovak national ice hockey team. He replaced Jan Filc and signed a four-year contract from April 1, 2010, to the next Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. Slovakia under his conduct has finished in 12th place on World Championship in Germany 2010. This contract ended prematurely on May 18, 2011, after the World Championship in Slovakia, where he led the Slovak national ice hockey team to the 10th place.

From 2011 to May 2013, Hanlon was assistant coach of the Vancouver Giants in the Western Hockey League before returning to coach in Europe.

In 2013, Glen returned to coach the Belarus national ice hockey team. He replaced Andrei Skabelka. On May 27, 2014, it was announced that Glen Hanlon signed a two-year contract as new head coach for the Swiss men&#x27;s national ice hockey team. Hanlon and the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation parted company in October 2015. The parting came by mutual consent due to family reasons.

On May 19, 2016, Hanlon was named general manager of Western Hockey League&#x27;s Vancouver Giants, the organization he had worked for as an assistant coach earlier in his career. He left the organization after the 2017–18 season.

On June 18, 2018, Hanlon was named the coach of the Hungarian team, DVTK Jegesmedvék.
On May 8, 2020, Hanlon became the head coach of the Krefeld Pinguine in Germany.

<text>.museum is a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet used exclusively by museums, museum associations, and individual members of the museum profession, as these groups are defined by the International Council of Museums (ICOM).

In joint action with the J. Paul Getty Trust, ICOM established the Museum Domain Management Association (MuseDoma), headed by Cary Karp, for the purpose of submitting an application to ICANN for the creation of the new generic top-level domain (gTLD), and to operate a registry. The domain was entered into the DNS root on 20 October 2001, and was the first sponsored top-level domain to be instituted through ICANN&#x27;s action.

The purpose of this domain is to reserve a segment of the DNS name space reserved for the use of museums; a name space whose conventions are defined by the museum community. The TLD grants users a quick and intuitive way to verify the authenticity of a museum site. Conversely, since it is a type of formal third-party certification, museums using this name space obtain a way to assure visitors of the site&#x27;s validity.

One of the initial ideas with the tld was to create a network of official museum websites, and operate a central indexing tool to make all of their hosted content searchable, discoverable.

In addition to the eligibility requirements specified in the charter, naming conventions apply to the labeling of subdomains. Extensive support is also being introduced for internationalized domain names, as described at .

Registrations are processed via accredited registrars.

<doc id="662195" wikidata="Q2891943" url="?curid=662195" title="Buck v. Bell">
<text>Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927), is a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court, written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., in which the Court ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit, including the intellectually disabled, &quot;for the protection and health of the state&quot; did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Despite the changing attitudes about sterilization, the Supreme Court has never expressly overturned &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;. It is widely believed to have been weakened by &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot;, 316 U.S. 535 (1942), which involved compulsory sterilization of male habitual criminals (and came to a contrary result). Legal scholar and Holmes biographer G. Edward White, in fact, wrote, &quot;the Supreme Court has distinguished the case [&quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;] out of existence&quot;. In addition, federal statutes, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, provide protections for people with disabilities, defined as both physical and mental impairments.

==Background==
The modern concept of eugenics was propounded in 1883 by Francis Galton, who also coined the name. The idea first became popular in the United States and had found proponents in Europe by the start of the 20th century; 42 of the 58 research papers presented at the First International Congress of Eugenics, held in London in 1912, were from American scientists. Indiana passed the first eugenics sterilization statute in 1907, but it was legally flawed. To remedy that situation, Harry Laughlin, of the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, designed a model eugenic law that was reviewed by legal experts. In 1924, the Commonwealth of Virginia adopted a statute authorizing the compulsory sterilization of the intellectually disabled for the purpose of eugenics, a statute closely based on Laughlin&#x27;s model.

Dr. Albert Sidney Priddy, superintendent of the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, could fairly be described as a zealot of eugenics. Prior to 1924, Priddy had performed hundreds of forced sterilizations by creatively interpreting laws which allowed surgery to benefit the &quot;physical, mental or moral&quot; condition of the inmates at the Colony. He would operate to relieve &quot;chronic pelvic disorder&quot; and, in the process, sterilize the women. According to Priddy, the women he chose were &quot;immoral&quot; because of their &quot;fondness for men,&quot; their reputations for &quot;promiscuity,&quot; and their &quot;over-sexed&quot; and &quot;man-crazy&quot; tendencies. One sixteen-year-old girl was sterilized for her habit of &quot;talking to the little boys.&quot;
Looking to determine if the new law would survive a legal challenge, on September 10, 1924, Priddy filed a petition with his board of directors to sterilize Carrie Buck. She was an 18-year-old patient at his institution who he claimed had a mental age of 9. Priddy maintained that Buck represented a genetic threat to society. According to him, Buck&#x27;s 52-year-old mother possessed a mental age of 8, had a record of prostitution and immorality, and had three children without good knowledge of their paternity. Carrie Buck, one of those children, had been adopted and attended school for five years, reaching the level of sixth grade. However, according to Priddy, Buck eventually proved to be &quot;incorrigible&quot; and gave birth to an illegitimate child. Her adoptive family had her committed to the State Colony as &quot;feeble-minded&quot;, feeling they were no longer capable of caring for her. It was later claimed that Buck&#x27;s pregnancy was not caused by any &quot;immorality&quot; on her own part. In the summer of 1923, while her adoptive mother was away &quot;on account of some illness,&quot; her adoptive mother&#x27;s nephew allegedly raped Buck, and her later commitment has been described as an attempt by the family to save their reputation.

==Buck family==
Carrie Buck was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, the first of three children born to Emma Buck; she also had a half-sister, Doris Buck, and a half-brother, Roy Smith. Little is known about Emma Buck except that she was poor and married to Frederick Buck, who abandoned her early in their marriage. Emma was committed to the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded after being accused of &quot;immorality&quot;, prostitution, and having syphilis.

After her birth, Carrie Buck was placed with foster parents, John and Alice Dobbs. She attended public school, where she was noted to be an average student. When she was in sixth grade, the Dobbses removed her to have her help with housework.

At 17, Buck became pregnant as a result of being raped by Alice Dobbs&#x27; nephew, Clarence Garland. On January 23, 1924, the Dobbses had her committed to the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded on the grounds of feeblemindedness, incorrigible behavior, and promiscuity. Her commitment is said to have been due to the family&#x27;s embarrassment at Buck&#x27;s pregnancy from the rape incident.

On March 28, 1924, she gave birth to a daughter. Since Buck had been declared mentally incompetent to raise her child, the Dobbses adopted the baby and named her &quot;Vivian Alice Elaine Dobbs&quot;. She attended Venable Public Elementary School of Charlottesville for four terms, from September 1930 until May 1932. By all accounts, Vivian was of average intelligence, far above feeblemindedness.In June 1932, Vivian contracted measles. She died from a secondary intestinal infection, enteric colitis, at the age of 8.
==Court case==
Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly passed the &quot;Eugenical Sterilization Act&quot; in 1924. According to American historian Paul A. Lombardo, politicians wrote the law to benefit a malpracticing doctor avoiding lawsuits from patients who had been the victims of forced sterilization. Eugenicists used Buck to legitimize this law in the 1927 Supreme Court case &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; through which they sought to gain legal permission for Virginia to sterilize Buck.

Carrie Buck found herself in the Colony in June 1924, shortly before her 18th birthday. Priddy quickly made the connection between Emma and Carrie, and he knew about the recently born Vivian: the board of directors issued an order for the sterilization of Buck and her guardian appealed the case to the Circuit Court of Amherst County.

In order to fully validate the law to Priddy&#x27;s satisfaction, the Board&#x27;s determination had to be defended in court. Thus, Irving P. Whitehead was appointed to &quot;defend&quot; Carrie from the Board&#x27;s ruling. Whitehead was not only a close friend of Priddy, a former member of the Colony Board and, unsurprisingly, a staunch believer in forced sterilization, but also a childhood friend of Aubrey E. Strode, who drafted the 1924 &quot;Eugenical Sterilization Act&quot;.

While the litigation was making its way through the court system, Priddy died and his successor, John Hendren Bell, took up the case.

Throughout Carrie&#x27;s trial, a succession of witnesses offered testimony that was hearsay, contentious, speculative, and simply absurd. Because Priddy and Strode felt it crucial to establish that Carrie&#x27;s entire family &quot;stock&quot; was defective, witnesses who had never met Carrie testified to rumors and anecdotes surrounding her and her family. One of the few witnesses to testify with first-hand knowledge of Carrie, a nurse from Charlottesville who had intermittent contact with Carrie over the years, recalled that in grammar school Carrie had been caught writing notes to boys. Priddy, of course, had once sterilized a girl for that transgression. For his testimony, Priddy felt the need to point out that Carrie had a &quot;rather badly formed face.&quot;

Whitehead failed to adequately defend Buck and counteract the prosecutors. Not only did he call no witnesses, but he did not challenge the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses&#x27; lack of firsthand knowledge or their dodgy scientific claims. Whitehead did not even call Carrie&#x27;s teachers, who could have proven, with documented evidence, that Carrie had been an average student, including one teacher who wrote that Carrie was &quot;very good&quot; at &quot;deportment and lessons.&quot; Instead, it seemed that Whitehead was often testifying against his own client, taking it for granted that she was of &quot;low caliber.&quot; He did not challenge the claim that Carrie was illegitimate, which was false as a matter of Virginia state law because Carrie&#x27;s parents were married at the time of her birth. Nor did he argue that Carrie&#x27;s supposed &quot;immorality&quot; and Vivian&#x27;s illegitimacy were due to a rape by the Dobbs&#x27; nephew, Clarence Garland.

Buck lost in the trial court, where noted Virginia eugenicist Joseph DeJarnette testified against her.

===Legal appeals and rulings===
The case then moved to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, where Whitehead offered a 5‑page compared to the state&#x27;s 40-page brief. Buck lost there too. Her only recourse was to the U.S. Supreme Court, but that was merely an illusion: even if Whitehead had put forth an effort, Carrie&#x27;s case was put before a Supreme Court with at least two avowed believers in eugenics: Chief Justice (and former president) William Howard Taft and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. In 1915, Taft had written the introduction to the book &quot;How to Live&quot;, which contained a sizable portion devoted to eugenics. As for Holmes, in 1921, he told future justice Felix Frankfurter that he had no problem &quot;restricting propagation by the undesirables and putting to death infants that didn&#x27;t pass the examination.&quot;

Buck and her guardian contended that the due process clause guarantees all adults the right to procreate which was being violated. They also made the argument that the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment was being violated since not all similarly situated people were being treated the same. The sterilization law was only for the &quot;feeble-minded&quot; at certain state institutions and made no mention of other state institutions or those who were not in an institution.

The legal challenge was consciously collusive, brought on behalf of the state to test the legality of the statute. The cross examination and witnesses produced by Whitehead were ineffectual and allegedly a result of his alliance with Strode during the trial. There was no real litigation between the prosecution and the defense, and thus the Supreme Court did not receive sufficient evidence to make a fair decision on the &quot;friendly [law]suit.&quot;
====Supreme Court====
On May 2, 1927, in an 8–1 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted that Buck, her mother and her daughter were &quot;feeble-minded&quot; and &quot;promiscuous,&quot; and that it was in the state&#x27;s interest to have her sterilized. The ruling found that the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924 did not violate the U.S. Constitution and legitimized the sterilization procedures until they were repealed in 1974.

Taft assigned the opinion to Holmes. His first draft was criticized by colleagues for substituting rhetorical flourishes about eugenics for legal analysis. Taft wrote:

Justice Holmes made clear that the challenge was not upon the medical procedure involved, but on the process of the substantive law. The court was satisfied that the Virginia Sterilization Act complied with the requirements of due process, since sterilization could not occur until a proper hearing had occurred, at which the patient and a guardian could be present, and the patient had the right to appeal the decision. They also found that, since the procedure was limited to people housed in state institutions, it did not deny the patient equal protection of the law. And finally, since the Virginia Sterilization Act was not a penal statute, the Court held that it did not violate the Eighth Amendment, since it is not intended to be punitive. Citing the best interests of the state, Justice Holmes affirmed the value of a law like Virginia&#x27;s in order to prevent the nation from being &quot;swamped with incompetence.&quot; The Court accepted without evidence that Carrie and her mother were promiscuous, and that the three generations of Bucks shared the genetic trait of feeblemindedness. Thus, it was in the state&#x27;s best interest to have Carrie Buck sterilized. The decision was seen as a major victory for eugenicists.Holmes concluded his argument by citing &quot;Jacobson v. Massachusetts&quot; as a precedent for the decision, stating &quot;Three generations of imbeciles are enough&quot;. The sole dissenter in the court, Justice Pierce Butler, a devout Catholic, did not write a dissenting opinion.

===Aftermath===
According to famed eugenicist Harry H. Laughlin, whose written testimony was presented during the trial in his absence, Buck&#x27;s legal defeat signaled the end of &quot;eugenical sterilization&#x27;s &#x27;experimental period.&#x27;&quot; Following the Supreme Court ruling, over two dozen states enacted similar laws, including Oregon and the Carolinas, doubling American sterilizations from 6,000 to more than 12,000 by 1947. Buck was sterilized on October 19, 1927, roughly five months after the Supreme Court trial verdict. She became the first Virginian sterilized since the 1924 &quot;Eugenical Sterilization Act&quot; passed. The Virginia sterilization law is said to have inspired Nazi Germany&#x27;s 400,000 sterilizations, including those sanctioned under the 1933 Law for Protection Against Genetically Defective Offspring.

Carrie Buck was operated upon, receiving a compulsory salpingectomy (a form of tubal ligation). She was later paroled from the institution as a domestic worker to a family in Bland, Virginia. She was an avid reader until her death in 1983. Her daughter Vivian had been pronounced &quot;feeble minded&quot; after a cursory examination by ERO field worker Dr. Arthur Estabrook. According to his report, Vivian &quot;showed backwardness&quot;, thus the &quot;three generations&quot; of the majority opinion. It is worth noting that the child did very well in school for the two years that she attended (she died of complications from measles in 1932), even being listed on her school&#x27;s honor roll in April 1931.

==Effects==

The effect of &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; was to legitimize eugenic sterilization laws in the United States as a whole. While many states already had sterilization laws on their books, their use was erratic and effects practically non-existent in every state except for California. After &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, dozens of states added new sterilization statutes, or updated their constitutionally non-functional ones already enacted, with statutes which more closely mirrored the Virginia statute upheld by the Court.

The Virginia statute that &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; upheld was designed in part by the eugenicist Harry H. Laughlin, superintendent of Charles Benedict Davenport&#x27;s Eugenics Record Office in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. Laughlin had, a few years previously, conducted studies on the enforcement of sterilization legislation throughout the country and had concluded that the reason for their lack of use was primarily that the physicians who would order the sterilizations were afraid of prosecution by patients upon whom they operated. Laughlin saw the need to create a &quot;Model Law&quot; that could withstand constitutional scrutiny, clearing the way for future sterilization operations. The Nazi jurists designing the German Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring based it largely on Laughlin&#x27;s &quot;Model Law&quot;, although development of that law preceded Laughlin&#x27;s. Nazi Germany held Laughlin in such high regard that they arranged for him to receive an honorary doctorate from Heidelberg University in 1936. At the Subsequent Nuremberg trials after World War II, counsel for &quot;SS&quot; functionary Otto Hofmann explicitly cited Holmes&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; in his defense.

Sterilization rates under eugenic laws in the United States climbed from 1927 until &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot;, 316 U.S. 535 (1942). While &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot; did not specifically overturn &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, it created enough of a legal quandary to discourage many sterilizations. By 1963, sterilization laws were almost wholly out of use, though some remained officially on the books for many years. Language referring to eugenics was removed from Virginia&#x27;s sterilization law, and the current law, passed in 1988 and amended in 2013, authorizes only the voluntary sterilization of those 18 and older, after the patient has given written consent and the doctor has informed the patient of the consequences as well as alternative methods of contraception.

The story of Carrie Buck&#x27;s sterilization and the court case was made into a television drama in 1994, &quot;Against Her Will: The Carrie Buck Story&quot;. It was also referred to in 1934&#x27;s sensational film &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Children&quot;, and was covered in the October 2018 &quot;American Experience&quot; documentary &quot;The Eugenics Crusade&quot;.

Although this opinion and eugenics remain widely condemned, the decision in the case has not been formally overturned. &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; was cited as a precedent by the opinion of the court (part VIII) in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, but not in support of abortion rights. To the contrary, Justice Blackmun quoted it to justify that the constitutional right to abortion is not unlimited. Blackmun claimed that the right to privacy was strong enough to prevent the state from protecting unborn life in the womb, but not strong enough to prevent a woman being sterilized against her will.

In the 1996 case of &quot;Fieger v. Thomas&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit both recognized and criticized &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; by writing, &quot;as Justice Holmes pointed out in the only part of &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; that remains unrepudiated, a claim of a violation of the Equal Protection Clause based upon selective enforcement &#x27;is the usual last resort of constitutional arguments. In 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit cited &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; to protect the constitutional rights of a woman coerced into sterilization without procedural due process. The court stated that error and abuse will result if the state does not follow the procedural requirements, established by &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, for performing an involuntary sterilization.

Derek Warden has shown how the decision in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; has been affected by the Americans with Disabilities Act.

<text>The Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars/Microvariabilité et Oscillations STellaire (MOST), was Canada&#x27;s first space telescope. Up until nearly 10 years after its launch it was also the smallest space telescope in orbit (for which its creators nicknamed it the &quot;Humble Space Telescope&quot;, in reference to one of the largest, the Hubble). MOST was the first spacecraft dedicated to the study of asteroseismology, subsequently followed by the now-completed CoRoT and Kepler missions. It was also the first Canadian science satellite launched since ISIS II, 32 years previously.

==Description==
As its name suggests, its primary mission was to monitor variations in star light, which it did by observing a single target for a long period of time (up to 60 days). Typically, larger space telescopes cannot afford to remain focused on a single target for so long due to the demand for their resources.

At , wide and tall, and deep, it was the size and weight of a small chest or an extra-large suitcase filled with electronics. This places it in the microsatellite category.

MOST was developed as a joint effort of the Canadian Space Agency, Dynacon Enterprises Limited (now Microsatellite Systems Canada Inc), the Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies, and the University of British Columbia. Led by Principal Investigator Jaymie Matthews, the MOST science team&#x27;s plan was to use observations from MOST to use asteroseismology to help date the age of the universe, and to search for visible-light signatures from extrasolar planets. 
The original SFL application to the CSA is available at
https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~rucinski/MOST_proposal_1997.pdf

MOST featured an instrument comprising a visible-light dual-CCD camera, fed by a 15-cm aperture Maksutov telescope. One CCD gathered science images, while the other provided images used by star-tracking software that, along with a set of four reaction wheels (computer-controlled motorized flywheels that are similar to gyroscopes) maintained pointing with an error of less than 1 arc-second, better pointing by far than any other microsatellite to date.

The design of the rest of MOST was inspired by and based on microsatellite bus designs pioneered by AMSAT, and first brought to commercial viability by the microsatellite company SSTL (based at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom); during the early stages of MOST development, the core group of AMSAT microsatellite satellite designers advised and mentored the MOST satellite design team, via a know-how transfer arrangement with UTIAS. This approach to satellite design is notable for making use of commercial-grade electronics, along with a &quot;small team,&quot; &quot;early prototyping&quot; engineering development approach rather different from that used in most other space-engineering programs, to achieve relatively very low costs: MOST&#x27;s life-cycle cost (design, build, launch and operate) was less than $10 million in Canadian funds (about 7 million Euros or 6 million USD, at exchange rates at time of launch).

==Operation history==
Development of the satellite was managed by the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s Space Science Branch, and was funded under its Small Payloads Program; its operations were (as of 2012) managed by the CSA&#x27;s Space Exploration Branch. It was operated by SFL (where the primary MOST ground station is located) jointly with Microsat Systems Canada Inc. (since the sale of Dynacon&#x27;s space division to MSCI in 2008). As of ten years after launch, despite failures of two of its components (one of the four reaction wheels and one of the two CCD driver boards), the satellite was still operating well, as a result of both on-going on-board software upgrades as well as built-in hardware redundancy, allowing improvements to performance and to reconfigure around failed hardware units.

In 2008, the MOST Satellite Project Team won the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute&#x27;s Alouette Award, which recognizes outstanding contributions to advancement in Canadian space technology, applications, science or engineering.

===Termination of operations funding by CSA===
On 30 April 2014, the Canadian Space Agency announced that funding to continue operating MOST would be withdrawn as of 9 September 2014, apparently as a result of funding cuts to the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s budget by the Harper government, despite the fact that the satellite continues to be fully operational and capable of making on-going science observations. P.I. Jaymie Matthews responded by saying that &quot;he will consider all options to keep the satellite in orbit, and that includes a direct appeal to the public.&quot;

===Post-CSA-funded operations===
In October 2014, the MOST Satellite was acquired by MSCI, which then commenced commercial operation of the satellite, offering a variety of potential uses including continuing the original MOST mission in partnership with Dr. Matthews, but also other planetary studies, attitude control system algorithm R&amp;D, and Earth observation. MOST was finally decommissioned in March 2019, after an apparent failure of its power subsystem.

==Discoveries==
The MOST team has reported a number of discoveries. In 2004 they reported that the star Procyon does not oscillate to the extent that had been expected, although this has been disputed.

In 2006 observations revealed a previously unknown class of variable stars, the &quot;slowly pulsating B supergiants&quot; (&quot;SPBsg&quot;). In 2011, MOST detected transits by exoplanet 55 Cancri e of its primary star, based on two weeks of nearly continuous photometric monitoring, confirming an earlier detection of this planet, and allowing investigations into the planet&#x27;s composition. In 2019, MOST photometry was used to disprove claims of permanent starspots on the surface of that were alleged to be caused by interactions between the magnetic fields of the star and its &quot;hot Jupiter&quot; exoplanet.

<text>Asterix and the Great Divide (, &quot;The Great Ditch&quot;) is the twenty-fifth volume of the Asterix comic book series. First published in French in 1980, it was translated into English in 1981. It is the first Asterix adventure to be written by illustrator Albert Uderzo, following the death of Asterix co-creator and writer René Goscinny in 1977.

==Plot summary==
A village in Gaul is politically and physically divided by a deep ditch because of a leadership dispute between rival chiefs Cleverdix and Majestix. Efforts to overcome their differences, first through dialogue and then through battle, only widen the rift. Majestix&#x27;s fishy advisor Codfix, suggests intervention by the local Roman garrison will enable Majestix to become the sole chief, in return for which, Codfix wants to marry his daughter, Melodrama. Majestix agrees to the plan, unaware that Codfix intends to overthrow him.

Melodrama reveals the plan to her lover, Histrionix, who is Cleverdix&#x27;s son. He is sent to the village of Vitalstatistix, who assigns Asterix and Obelix, accompanied by Getafix, to prevent Roman intervention.

Codfix promises the local Roman centurion he can take Cleverdix&#x27;s followers as slaves for the legionaries, but Majestix refuses to allow his opponents to be enslaved. Enraged, the centurion imprisons Majestix and his followers. Asterix, Obelix and Getafix infiltrate the Romans&#x27; camp with the intention of releasing the prisoners. At the camp entrance, Getafix inadvertently leaves behind a flask of elixir, which restores a subject to full health while erasing his memory of the injury necessitating it. Codfix secretly observes a demonstration of the elixir and then takes the flask.

Inside the camp, Getafix makes his usual magic potion in the guise of soup. When the suspicious centurion orders them to test it for poison, they give it to the prisoners, enabling them to defeat the Romans. Back at the village, Getafix makes more potion, and places it at a house spanning the ditch, with Asterix on watch. Codfix uses Getafix&#x27;s elixir to cure the Romans and exploits their amnesia to claim the Gauls attacked the Romans unprovoked. That night, he returns to his village and seizes the potion, which (after having drunk it himself) he conveys to the Romans.

At the next day&#x27;s battle, the mixture of the two potions causes the Romans to inflate like balloons and then shrink to minuscule size. Terrified by this transformation, they promise to leave the local Gauls in peace. Meanwhile, Codfix has kidnapped Melodrama for a ransom of 100 pounds of gold. Histrionix goes after him, accompanied by Asterix and Obelix.

Codfix, escaping via river with Melodrama, is captured by the series&#x27; recurrent pirates and offers them a share of the ransom. They are then attacked by the Gauls. Having consumed some magic potion, Histrionix duels Codfix, rendering the Pirates&#x27; ship once again a sunken wreck. Histrionix takes the upper hand and strikes Codfix for a literal mile into the Roman camp. At the village, the chieftains agree to a single combat fight but it eventually ends in a draw, whereupon Asterix, as referee, declares Histrionix chief instead. The villagers then divert the nearby river, filling the ditch, while Codfix is shown as the Romans&#x27; sole drudge. Histrionix and Melodrama are married, and Asterix, Obelix and Getafix return home.

==Commentary==
*Uderzo intended the Great Divide as a metaphor and condemnation of the Berlin Wall, which once separated Socialist East Berlin from Democratic West Berlin. The wall was torn down nine years after this album was published.
*An audiobook of &quot;Asterix and the Great Divide&quot; adapted by Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge and narrated by Willie Rushton was released on Hodder and Stoughton&#x27;s &quot;Hodder Children&#x27;s Audio&quot; in 1987.
*This was the first volume of the series that was designed and written by Albert Uderzo alone, after the death of his long-time collaborator René Goscinny, and published by his own company, &quot;Editions Albert René&quot;. 
*In the English translation, Getafix laments - &quot;Change and decay in all around I see&quot; is taken from Henry Francis Lyte&#x27;s hymn, Abide with Me.

<text>Peter William Shorrocks Butterworth (4 February 1915 – 17 January 1979) was a British actor and comedian best known for his appearances in the &quot;Carry On&quot; film series. He was also a regular on children&#x27;s television and radio. Butterworth was married to actress and impressionist Janet Brown.

==Early life==
Butterworth was born on 4 February 1915, in Bramhall, Cheshire.

==War service==
Butterworth served as a lieutenant in the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy during the Second World War. On 21 June 1940 while serving with 826 Naval Air Squadron, Butterworth was shot down during an attack against a German-occupied seaplane air base on Texel in the Netherlands. Two Fairey Albacores were brought down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s over the Wadden Sea. Four were killed; Butterworth and his air gunner became POWs. 

Butterworth was sent to Stalag Luft III near Sagan in Poland. It was there he met Talbot Rothwell, who later went on to write many of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films in which Butterworth was to star. Having never performed in public before his imprisonment, Butterworth formed a duo with Rothwell and sang in the camp shows. They delivered a song which Rothwell called &quot;The Letter Edged In Black&quot;. The performance was followed by some comic repartee which, according to Butterworth&#x27;s account, provoked enough boos and hisses to have the desired effect of drowning out the sounds of an escape tunnel being dug by other prisoners&#x27; escape party. After the war, Butterworth kept a photo of the concert party line-up, something which offered inspiration to him when starting a career in acting.

Butterworth was one of the vaulters covering for the escapers during the escape portrayed by the book and film &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;. Butterworth later auditioned for the film in 1949 but &quot;didn&#x27;t look convincingly heroic or athletic enough&quot; according to the makers of the film. Within the same camp as Butterworth and Rothwell were the future actors Rupert Davies and John Casson, the son of Lewis Casson and Sybil Thorndike. All four remained very close friends after the war ended and they all appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; when Butterworth was a subject of the programme in 1975.

Following the release of various archived documents from Germany in February 2024, the BBC News website reported a fuller picture of Butterworth&#x27;s wartime escapades having interviewed his son, Tyler, for the article.

==Acting career==
Butterworth came to notice after appearing in pantomime around the UK. His first film appearance was in the Val Guest film &quot;William Comes to Town&quot; (1948). Guest and Butterworth became close friends and the two worked on a further seven films together during their careers. His first major success was on television in the Terry-Thomas sketch show &quot;How Do You View?&quot; in which he played the chauffeur &quot;Lockitt&quot;: his wife, Janet Brown, was also a cast member. Butterworth also presented successful programmes aimed at children in the 1950s including &quot;Whirligig&quot; and &quot;Butterworth Time&quot;. 

He continued to take minor parts in films and went on to appear alongside actors including Sean Connery, David Niven and Douglas Fairbanks Jr during his career. Around the time his work in the Carry On films began, he guest appeared in two First Doctor &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories, starring William Hartnell, in 1965/66, (&quot;The Time Meddler&quot; and &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;), playing The Monk.

He starred in the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Saturday Special&quot; (with the puppet Porterhouse the Parrot), broadcast on Saturdays at 5:00 pm, alternating with &quot;Whirligig&quot;.

==&quot;Carry On&quot; ==
Butterworth&#x27;s association with the Carry On films began mid-way through the series with &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot; (1965), playing the part of &quot;Doc&quot;. He was put in touch with the creator of the series, Peter Rogers, by his friend Talbot Rothwell, the writer of &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot; and who had written the previous four films. Out of the actors who were considered to be the &quot;Carry On&quot; team, he was the sixth most prolific performer in the series, making sixteen film appearances, two Christmas specials, the television series in 1975 and the west end theatre productions which also toured the country, alongside Sid James, Barbara Windsor and Kenneth Connor.

His Carry On appearances portrayed his characters as typically quiet and subtly eccentric. He was often cast as a stooge for another character. Thus, in &quot;Carry On Screaming!&quot; he played Detective Constable Slobotham, the assistant for Detective Sergeant Bung (Harry H. Corbett); while in &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot; he played Citizen Bidet, the assistant to Citizen Camembert (Kenneth Williams). In &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; he played Joshua Fiddler, the laid-back and eccentric camp site manager, who persuades Sid James&#x27;s character to part with most of his money when booking into the camp site. Such was his loyalty to Peter Rogers and Gerald Thomas that Butterworth agreed to play three small roles in &quot;Carry On Again Doctor&quot;, &quot;Carry On Loving&quot; and &quot;Carry On Henry&quot;. He was unable to take larger parts due to other work and stage commitments, but these minor roles were specially written into the films for him.

Butterworth returned to playing more substantial parts within the &quot;Carry On&quot; films with &quot;Carry On Abroad&quot; (1972), in which he played &#x27;Pepe&#x27; the manager of an unfinished hotel with his nagging wife (Hattie Jacques). Butterworth remained with the series until the final film in the main series, &quot;Carry On Emmannuelle&quot; (1978).

==Later career==
Having appeared in many of Val Guest&#x27;s films during the beginning of his career, he also made three appearances in the films of Richard Lester. He appeared in Lester&#x27;s film version of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966). A decade later, he appeared consecutively in &quot;The Ritz&quot; and &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (both 1976) alongside Sean Connery, Richard Harris and Audrey Hepburn. He had an uncredited cameo part in the film version of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968) as a shopkeeper in court, and made a special appearance in an episode of &quot;Catweazle&quot; (&quot;The Demi Devil&quot; [1970]) and the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;The Face on the Poster&quot; (1975).

In 1975 he was the subject of an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; whereby Eamonn Andrews surprised him while he was shopping in Selfridges, London. Friends who took part in the show included Terry Scott, Talbot Rothwell, Jimmy Jewel, John Casson and Rupert Davies. Butterworth&#x27;s wife and their two children, Tyler and Emma were also at the recording. When the Carry on films finished in 1978, Butterworth began to concentrate on straight roles, taking a small part in the feature film &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot; with Sean Connery, and the Alan Bennett play &quot;Afternoon Off&quot; (both 1979). These two productions were shown posthumously.

==Personal life==
Butterworth was introduced to actress and impressionist Janet Brown by Rothwell and the two married in 1946 at St Mary&#x27;s, Bryanston Square, Marylebone. Brown later became known for her television impersonations of Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s. They had two children: Their son, Tyler Butterworth, also became an actor and is married to the actress Janet Dibley. Their daughter, Emma, was born in 1962. She died in 1996 aged 34.

==Death==
In 1979, whilst &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot; was on general release, Butterworth was starring as Widow Twankey in the pantomime &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Coventry Theatre. When the show had finished, he went back to his hotel following the evening&#x27;s performance. His failure to return for the following day&#x27;s matinee show caused alarm, and he was found dead in his room from a heart attack.

Butterworth was buried in Danehill Cemetery, in East Sussex. Following his death, the producer of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, Peter Rogers, said that Butterworth was &quot;a thoroughly nice bloke and a dear friend&quot;.

<text>The Government Radio Network (GRN) is a network of various systems in place across Australia that enable statewide trunked radio communication. The network operates through inter-linked sites for government and public services such as police, ambulance, fire, or roads authorities which require such a system to function properly. The main aim of the GRN is to consolidate all resources into one network, ensuring greater coverage and reliability than if each department had its own independent communication system. The existence of the GRN also reduces the amount of government money and resources needed to maintain communication between units of emergency and public service branches. Last, it allows effective intercommunication among these services in times of national or state emergency for coordination of wide-scale actions.

==Australian Capital Territory Radio Network (TRN)==

<text>In mathematics, the von Neumann conjecture stated that a group &quot;G&quot; is non-amenable if and only if &quot;G&quot; contains a subgroup that is a free group on two generators. The conjecture was disproved in 1980.

In 1929, during his work on the Banach–Tarski paradox, John von Neumann defined the concept of amenable groups and showed that no amenable group contains a free subgroup of rank 2. The suggestion that the converse might hold, that is, that every non-amenable group contains a free subgroup on two generators, was made by a number of different authors in the 1950s and 1960s. Although von Neumann&#x27;s name is popularly attached to the conjecture, its first written appearance seems to be due to Mahlon Marsh Day in 1957.

The Tits alternative is a fundamental theorem which, in particular, establishes the conjecture within the class of linear groups.

The historically first potential counterexample is Thompson group &quot;F&quot;. While its amenability is a wide-open problem, the general conjecture was shown to be false in 1980 by Alexander Ol&#x27;shanskii; he demonstrated that Tarski monster groups, constructed by him, which are easily seen not to have free subgroups of rank 2, are not amenable. Two years later, Sergei Adian showed that certain Burnside groups are also counterexamples. None of these counterexamples are finitely presented, and for some years it was considered possible that the conjecture held for finitely presented groups. However, in 2003, Alexander Ol&#x27;shanskii and Mark Sapir exhibited a collection of finitely presented groups which do not satisfy the conjecture.

In 2013, Nicolas Monod found an easy counterexample to the conjecture. Given by piecewise projective homeomorphisms of the line, the group is remarkably simple to understand. Even though it is not amenable, it shares many known properties of amenable groups in a straightforward way. In 2013, Yash Lodha and Justin Tatch Moore isolated a finitely presented non-amenable subgroup of Monod&#x27;s group. This provides the first torsion-free finitely presented counterexample, and admits a presentation with 3 generators and 9 relations. Lodha later showed that this group satisfies the property formula_1, which is a stronger finiteness property.

<text>The Big Arvo, originally titled The Big Breakfast, was an Australian television program that was broadcast on the Seven Network from 1999 until 2005.

==History==
The program began in a morning time slot under the title &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, before moving to the afternoon as &quot;The Big Arvo&quot;, to make way for &quot;AMV: All Music Video&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot;. The program was presented by four hosts, who hosted the show in a large model bus. The program included segments such as &quot;cool job&quot; and &quot;dare&quot; to amuse younger viewers and to teach viewers who had outgrown &quot;Play School&quot;. It appeared in &quot;K-Zone&quot; magazine to celebrate 500 episodes.

<doc id="662262" wikidata="Q6980761" url="?curid=662262" title="Natural proof">
<text>In computational complexity theory, a natural proof is a certain kind of proof establishing that one complexity class differs from another one. While these proofs are in some sense &quot;natural&quot;, it can be shown (assuming a widely believed conjecture on the existence of pseudorandom functions) that no such proof can possibly be used to solve the P vs. NP problem.

==Overview==
The notion of natural proofs was introduced by Alexander Razborov and Steven Rudich in their article &quot;Natural Proofs&quot;, first presented in 1994, and later published in 1997, for which they received the 2007 Gödel Prize.

Specifically, natural proofs prove lower bounds on the circuit complexity of boolean functions. 
A natural proof shows, either directly or indirectly, that a boolean function has a certain natural combinatorial property. Under the assumption that pseudorandom functions exist with &quot;exponential hardness&quot; as specified in their main theorem, Razborov and Rudich show that these proofs cannot separate certain complexity classes. Notably, assuming pseudorandom functions exist, these proofs cannot separate the complexity classes P and NP.

For example, their article states:
:[...] consider a commonly envisioned proof strategy for proving P ≠ NP:
:* Formulate some mathematical notion of &quot;discrepancy&quot; or &quot;scatter&quot; or &quot;variation&quot; of the values of a Boolean function, or of an associated polytope or other structure. [...]
:* Show by an inductive argument that polynomial-sized circuits can only compute functions of &quot;low&quot; discrepancy. [...]
:* Then show that SAT, or some other function in NP, has &quot;high&quot; discrepancy.
:Our main theorem in Section 4 gives evidence that &quot;no proof strategy along these lines can ever succeed.

A property of boolean functions is defined to be &quot;natural&quot; if it contains a property meeting the constructivity and largeness conditions defined by Razborov and Rudich. Roughly speaking, the constructivity condition requires that a property be decidable in (quasi-)polynomial time when the 2&quot;n&quot;-sized truth table of an &quot;n&quot;-input boolean function is given as input, asymptotically as &quot;n&quot; increases. This is the same as time singly exponential in &quot;n&quot;. Properties that are easy to understand are likely to satisfy this condition. The largeness condition requires that the property hold for a sufficiently large fraction of the set of all boolean functions.

A property is &quot;useful&quot; against a complexity class &quot;C&quot; if every sequence of boolean functions having the property infinitely often defines a language outside of &quot;C&quot;. A &quot;natural proof&quot; is a proof that establishes that a certain language lies outside of &quot;C&quot; and refers to a natural property that is useful against &quot;C&quot;.

Razborov and Rudich give a number of examples of lower-bound proofs against classes &quot;C&quot; smaller than P/poly that can be &quot;naturalized&quot;, i.e. converted into natural proofs. An important example treats proofs that the parity problem is not in the class AC0. They give strong evidence that the techniques used in these proofs cannot be extended to show stronger lower bounds. In particular, AC0-natural proofs cannot be useful against AC0[m].

Razborov and Rudich also reproduce Avi Wigderson&#x27;s unconditional proof that natural proofs cannot prove exponential lower bounds for the discrete logarithm problem.

There is strong current belief that the mechanism of this paper actually blocks lower-bound proofs against the complexity class TC0 of constant-depth, polynomial-sized threshold circuits, which is believed but not proven smaller than P/poly. This belief is because, under widely believed conjectures regarding the hardness of factoring in certain elliptic curve groups, there exist exponentially hard pseudorandom functions computable in TC0. However, some researchers believe that the Razborov-Rudich limitations are actually good guidance for what a &quot;super-natural&quot; lower-bound proof might involve, such as properties hard or complete for exponential space.

<text>VRA Rescue NSW (VRA) is an Australian volunteer organisation that provides rescue services to the communities across New South Wales. The first rescue squads formed the Volunteer Rescue Association with the assistance of the New South Wales Police Force. The service is now called VRA Rescue NSW. Groups with common charters can become an affiliate of the Association.

In times of need, whether it be in the emergency or recovery phase, VRA can bring affiliated squads together to provide assistance to other services or to assist one of its own affiliates.

The first VRA specialist squad, Bushwalkers Search and Rescue (today known as NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue) was formed in 1936. The first VRA General Land Rescue Squad was formed in 1950 to assist police with recovery of persons from the Murrumbidgee River, to provide flood rescue, evacuations and ferrying of food and medicines between isolated communities around Wagga Wagga in southern NSW. Soon after the Wagga Wagga Rescue Squad became involved in general land rescue. In 1960 the Bourke Rescue Squad was formed, followed in 1962 by the Dubbo Rescue Squad. In 1969, at the suggestion of the state police commissioner several volunteer rescue squads (Albury, Dubbo, Narrandera and Wagga Wagga) met and formed the Volunteer Rescue Association. VRA Rescue Squads (such as The Mudgee Rescue Squad in January 1975) continued to be established where a need existed and the Police, Ambulance, Fire Brigade and local community supported the establishment of a volunteer rescue squad.

Today, VRA Rescue NSW provides a training structure with competency-based learning under its own registered training organisation, and with policies and procedures affiliated rescue squads provide a comprehensive rescue service to the community. The registered training organisation was formerly VRA Training Pty Ltd. Now RFS Training. VRA Rescue NSW provides a command structure when rescue squads come together, during major incidents, with standardisation of equipment. The squads all come together as a cohesive team.

Regional squads can be either land or marine based. Land-based squads can be involved with motor vehicle accident rescue, vertical rescue, river rescue and dive rescue. Marine-based squads can be involved with coastal emergencies on the north and south coast. In addition, there are specialist squads with particular skills who do not operate in any particular region. Examples of these include squads with bushwalking, cave rescue, radio (communications), Australian Civil Air Patrol (aircraft), and dog expertise.

The current commissioner of VRA Rescue NSW is Brenton Charlton.

== Major incidents attended ==

VRA Rescue NSW is involved on a day-to-day basis in general rescue operations. Primarily, road accident rescue, land and maritime search and rescue operations. VRA Rescue has responded to the following major incidents:

* 1974 Cyclone Tracy - Darwin (Rescue - 124 personnel and equipment available within 6 hours - not responded) 
* 1977 Granville rail disaster (Rescue - two rescue squads responded)
* 1989 Newcastle earthquake [Newcastle Workers Club collapse] (Rescue - Two rescue squads responded immediately and subsequently 100 operators and support personnel to sustain 24-hour operations)
* 1990 Nyngan flood (Assisted police with evacuations)
* 1994 bush fire emergency (Assist police and ambulance with evacuations, provide communications support and provide welfare support to firefighters - 315 personnel)
* 1997 Thredbo landslide
* 1999 Sydney hailstorm (Assistance to the State Emergency Service)
* 2019-2020 NSW Bushfires (Assist NSW SES, NSW RFS &amp; NSW Police Evacuating People that were in the vicinity of the Fires)

== Volunteering ==
As with many volunteer organisations, an increasing number of VRA squads face difficulties recruiting sufficient personnel in order to respond effectively to incidents. This has led to a gradual decline in the number of accredited squads from 47 in 2007 down to 32 by 2013. With responsibility moving to other organisations such as Fire and Rescue NSW and the State Emergency Service.
VRA has received government funding for new vehicles, equipment and training, $18.8 million over four years.

<doc id="662267" wikidata="Q1439882" url="?curid=662267" title="Foundry model">
<text>The foundry model is a microelectronics engineering and manufacturing business model consisting of a semiconductor fabrication plant, or foundry, and an integrated circuit design operation, each belonging to separate companies or subsidiaries. It was first conceived by Morris Chang, the founder of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC).

Integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) design and manufacture integrated circuits. Many companies, known as fabless semiconductor companies, only design devices; merchant or pure play foundries only manufacture devices for other companies, without designing them. Examples of IDMs are Intel, Samsung, and Texas Instruments,
examples of pure play foundries are GlobalFoundries, TSMC, and UMC, and examples of fabless companies are AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm.

Integrated circuit production facilities are expensive to build and maintain. Unless they can be kept at nearly full use, they will become a drain on the finances of the company that owns them. The foundry model uses two methods to avoid these costs: fabless companies avoid costs by not owning such facilities. Merchant foundries, on the other hand, find work from the worldwide pool of fabless companies, through careful scheduling, pricing, and contracting, keep their plants in full use.

==History==
Companies that both designed and produced the devices were originally responsible for manufacturing microelectronic devices. These manufacturers were involved in both the research and development of manufacturing processes and the research and development of microcircuit design.

The first pure play semiconductor company is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation founded by Morris Chang, a spin-off of the government Industrial Technology Research Institute, which split its design and fabrication divisions in 1987, a model advocated for by Carver Mead in the U.S., but deemed too costly to pursue. The separation of design and fabrication became known as the foundry model, with fabless manufacturing outsourcing to semiconductor foundries.

Fabless semiconductor companies do not have any semiconductor fabrication capability, instead contracting with a merchant foundry for fabrication. The fabless company concentrates on the research and development of an IC-product; the foundry concentrates on manufacturing and testing the physical product. If the foundry does not have any semiconductor design capability, it is a pure-play semiconductor foundry.

An absolute separation into fabless and foundry companies is not necessary. Many companies continue to exist that perform both operations and benefit from the close coupling of their skills. Some companies manufacture some of their own designs and contract out to have others manufactured or designed, in cases where they see value or seek special skills. The foundry model is a business model that seeks to optimize productivity.

===MOSIS===
The very first merchant foundries were part of the MOSIS service. The MOSIS service gave limited production access to designers with limited means, such as students, university researchers, and engineers at small startups. The designer submitted designs, and these submissions were manufactured with the commercial company&#x27;s extra capacity. Manufacturers could insert some wafers for a MOSIS design into a collection of their own wafers when a processing step was compatible with both operations. The commercial company (serving as foundry) was already running the process, so they were effectively being paid by MOSIS for something they were already doing. A factory with excess capacity during slow periods could also run MOSIS designs to avoid having expensive capital equipment stand idle.

Under-use of an expensive manufacturing plant could lead to the financial ruin of the owner, so selling surplus wafer capacity was a way to maximize the fab&#x27;s use. Hence, economic factors created a climate where fab operators wanted to sell surplus wafer-manufacturing capacity and designers wanted to purchase manufacturing capacity rather than try to build it.

Although MOSIS opened the doors to some fabless customers, earning additional revenue for the foundry and providing inexpensive service to the customer, running a business around MOSIS production was difficult. The merchant foundries sold wafer capacity on a surplus basis, as a secondary business activity. Services to the customers were secondary to the commercial business, with little guarantee of support. The choice of merchant dictated the design, development flow, and available techniques to the fabless customer. Merchant foundries might require proprietary and non-portable preparation steps. Foundries concerned with protecting what they considered trade secrets of their methodologies might only be willing to release data to designers after an onerous nondisclosure procedure.

===Dedicated foundry===
In 1987, the world&#x27;s first dedicated merchant foundry opened its doors: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The distinction of &#x27;dedicated&#x27; is in reference to the typical merchant foundry of the era, whose primary business activity was building and selling of its own IC-products. The dedicated foundry offers several key advantages to its customers: first, it does not sell finished IC-products into the supply channel; thus a dedicated foundry will never compete directly with its fabless customers (obviating a common concern of fabless companies). Second, the dedicated foundry can scale production capacity to a customer&#x27;s needs, offering low-quantity shuttle services in addition to full-scale production lines. Finally, the dedicated foundry offers a &quot;COT-flow&quot; (customer owned tooling) based on industry-standard EDA systems, whereas many IDM merchants required its customers to use proprietary (non-portable) development tools. The COT advantage gave the customer complete control over the design process, from concept to final design.

==Foundry sales leaders by year==
* Pure-play semiconductor foundry is a company that does not offer a significant amount of IC products of its own design, but instead operates semiconductor fabrication plants focused on producing ICs for other companies.
* Integrated device manufacturer (IDM) semiconductor foundry is where companies such as Texas Instruments, IBM, and Samsung join in to provide foundry services as long as there is no conflict of interest between relevant parties.

==Financial and IP issues==
Like all industries, the semiconductor industry faces upcoming challenges and obstacles.

The cost to stay on the leading edge has steadily increased with each generation of chips. The financial strain is being felt by both large merchant foundries and their fabless customers. The cost of a new foundry exceeds $1 billion. These costs must be passed on to customers. Many merchant foundries have entered into joint ventures with their competitors in an effort to split research and design expenditures and fab-maintenance expenses.

Chip design companies sometimes avoid other companies&#x27; patents simply by purchasing the products from a licensed foundry with broad cross-license agreements with the patent owner.

Stolen design data is also a concern; data is rarely directly copied, because blatant copies are easily identified by distinctive features in the chip,
placed there either for this purpose or as a byproduct of the design process. However, the data including any procedure, process system, method of operation or concept may be sold to a competitor, who may save months or years of tedious reverse engineering.

<text>John O&#x27;Byrne (24 April 1884 – 14 January 1954) was an Irish judge and barrister who served as a Judge of the Supreme Court from 1940 to 1954, a Judge of the High Court from 1926 to 1940 and Attorney General of Ireland from 1924 to 1926.

==Early life==
He was born on 24 April 1884, the fourth son of Patrick O&#x27;Byrne and Mary O&#x27;Byrne (née Tallon), of Seskin, County Wicklow. He was educated at the Patrician Monastery, Tullow, County Carlow, and studied Moral and Mental Science at the Royal University, where he graduated in 1907 in First Place with First Class Honours. He was awarded a Master of Arts degree in 1908.

He joined the Irish Land Commission, where he acquired an intimate knowledge of the system of real property and land tenure in Ireland. Subsequently, he studied at King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1911, where he practised mainly in real property.

He stood as a pro-Treaty Sinn Féin candidate at the 1922 general election for the Wexford constituency but was not elected. In 1922, he was appointed by the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State to the Irish Free State Constitution Commission to draft the Constitution of the Irish Free State, commonly known as the Irish Free State Constitution Commission. It prepared a draft Constitution. He was thus one of the constitutional architects of the Irish Free State.

In 1923, he was appointed to the Judiciary Commission by the Government of the Irish Free State, on a reference from the Government to establish a new system for the administration of justice in accordance with the Constitution of the Irish Free State. The Judiciary Commission was chaired by the last Lord Chief Justice of Ireland (who had also been the last Lord Chancellor of Ireland). It drafted legislation for a new system of courts, including a High Court and a Supreme Court, and provided for the abolition of the Irish Court of Appeal.

He was appointed King&#x27;s Counsel in 1924, becoming the last member of counsel in the Irish Free State to be appointed, thereafter counsel were appointed as Senior Counsel. He was also a delegate of the Irish Free State to the League of Nations in the same year.

==Legal career==
On 7 June 1924, he was appointed the second Attorney-General of the Irish Free State when Hugh Kennedy was appointed Chief Justice of Ireland.

==Judicial career==
On 9 January 1926, he was appointed a High Court judge, upon which he served until he was elevated to the bench of the Supreme Court of Ireland in 1940. He was also Chairman of the Irish Legal Terms Advisory Committee from 14 May 1948 to 13 May 1953.

==Reputation on the bench==
Another High Court judge, Kenneth Deale writing extrajudicially in &quot;Beyond Any Reasonable Doubt?&quot;, a collection of essays on celebrated Irish murder trials, offers some interesting insights into O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses as a judge. Deale praises him as a sound and experienced lawyer, conscientious, principled and level-headed. However, he believed that O&#x27;Byrne had one serious flaw- he was excessively strong-minded and having made up his mind was most reluctant to change it. This in Deale&#x27;s view was a serious fault in a judge especially in criminal trials, where Deale found it hard to believe that a jury would not be greatly influenced by the summing up of so formidable and strong-minded a judge. In particular, Deale strongly criticised his conduct of the trial of Thomas Kelly, tried in 1936 for the murder of Patrick Henry. In Deale&#x27;s view, O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s summing-up was designed to convince the jury that the accused was guilty (Kelly, after an unprecedented three trials, was found guilty, but the Government, which seems to have had some doubts about his guilt, reprieved him from the death penalty).

==Personal life ==
He married Margaret (Marjorie) McGuire in 1924; and they had five children. They lived at Stonehurst, Killiney, County Dublin. He died in office on 14 January 1954. His widow brought a celebrated test case arguing that judges could not be required to pay income tax as this breached the Constitutional guarantee that their incomes can not be reduced. The Supreme Court decided by a 3–2 majority that notwithstanding the guarantee, judges are liable to pay income tax.

One of his sons was Paddy O&#x27;Byrne who became one of the best known radio presenters in South Africa.

<text>MOSIS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service) is multi-project wafer service that provides metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) chip design tools and related services that enable universities, government agencies, research institutes and businesses to prototype chips efficiently and cost-effectively.

Operated by the University of Southern California&#x27;s Information Sciences Institute (ISI), MOSIS combines customers&#x27; orders onto shared multi-project wafers that speed production and reduce costs compared with underutilized single-project wafers. Customers are able to debug and adjust designs, or to commission small-volume runs, without making major production investments. Fabrication costs are also shared by combining multiple designs from a single customer onto one &quot;mask set,&quot; or wafer template. According to MOSIS, the service has delivered more than 60,000 integrated circuit designs.

Funded by DARPA, MOSIS was created in 1981 by ISI&#x27;s Danny Cohen, an Internet pioneer who also developed Voice over Internet Protocol and Video over Internet Protocol. It was based on the revolutionary VLSI design methodology of Carver Mead and Lynn Conway, who pioneered and/or popularized the use of technology-independent design rules and modular cell-based, hierarchical system design, testing this new approach to rapid prototyping and short-run fabrication at Xerox PARC. One of the first e-commerce providers, MOSIS also launched the &quot;fabless foundry&quot; industry, in which vendors outsource chip fabrication rather than manufacturing them in-house. Thousands of students also have learned chip design in MOSIS-associate programs.

Many early MOSIS users were students trying IC layout techniques from the seminal book &quot;Introduction to VLSI Design&quot; () published in 1980 by Caltech professor Carver Mead and MIT professor Lynn Conway. Some early reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors such as MIPS (1984) and SPARC (1987) were run through MOSIS during their early design and testing phases.

<doc id="662278" wikidata="Q16015747" url="?curid=662278" title="Helge Boes">
<text>Helge Phillipp Boes (June 20, 1970 – February 5, 2003) was a German American intelligence officer who served in the Central Intelligence Agency early in the Global War on Terrorism.

== Early life and education ==
On Jun 20, 1970, Helge Boes was born in Hamburg, West Germany to American Roderich Boes and German Monika Boes. The family moved to West Berlin when he was two, and life in the walled city surrounded by Communist East Germany allowed him &quot;to see up close the damaging effects of a closed society,” his older brother Henrik told Reuters in 2003. Boes attended John F. Kennedy School, a German-American elementary and high school where he excelled in soccer, graduating in 1989.

In 1989, Boes moved to Kennesaw, Georgia and enrolled at Georgia State University. He graduated summa cum laude in 1992. He then entered Harvard Law School, graduating cum laude in 1997 alongside his future wife, Cindy E. Tidler. The two married in 1999.

== Legal career ==
Following graduation from law school, Boes joined the white shoe law firm Latham &amp; Watkins, where he worked as a staff attorney until, 2001, when he decided to give up the legal profession to join the CIA.

== CIA career ==

Joining the Central Intelligence Agency as a member of the Directorate of Operations Clandestine Service Trainee Class, Boes immediately excelled in training. According to his biography on the CIA&#x27;s website, &quot;he was a standout among the trainees of our Clandestine Service&quot;, adding &quot;one of Helge’s ops instructors called him &quot;a case officer’s case officer.&quot; DO officers know how high a compliment that is.&quot;

Following training, Boes was assigned to the Counterterrorist Center (CTC), and in Spring 2002 made himself one of the earliest volunteers for assignment to Afghanistan. After a successful first tour in the nascent war, Boes returned to headquarters for a few months, but by early 2003 he volunteered for a second assignment to Afghanistan.

=== Death in Afghanistan ===
On February 5, 2003, 32-year-old Boes was killed in eastern Afghanistan during a live-fire training exercise when a grenade detonated prematurely, killing him and wounding two others. He was the second CIA officer to die as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the first being paramilitary officer Mike Spann on November 25, 2001. Boes death in the line of duty, the 80th since the inception of the agency - was announced to the CIA headquarters workforce on February 7th - at which time CIA Director George Tenet posthumously awarded Boes the Exceptional Service Medallion. &quot;For the life Helge led,&quot; said Tenet, &quot;one of courage and sacrifice, one of service without public reward—he has earned the gratitude of every American family.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Boes was survived by his wife, Cindy Tidler, his parents, Roderich and Monika Boes of Germany, and his brother Henrik of Colorado. He was given a Catholic funeral at Christ the Redeemer Catholic Church in Sterling, Virginia, with CIA Director Tenet giving a eulogy. His remains were subsequently interred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C.. On his grave is the German inscription: &quot;Was du sein willst. sei est ganz.&quot;, which translates as &quot;Whatever you want to be, be it completely.&quot;

According to Reuters, Helge and fellow Harvard Law class of 1997 member Michael E. Weston were best friends during and after law school, and both found private legal practice unfulfilling. They also loved the same woman, their Harvard Law classmate Cindy Tidler. Tidler and Boes married in 1999. Six years after Boes death in 2003, she married Weston. He was killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan five months later while working for the DEA, the War in Afghanistan ultimately widowing her twice.

The Washington Premier League, the United States Adult Soccer Association affiliate serving the Washington DC metropolitan area with which Helga used to play goalkeeper, has hosted the Helga Boes Cup as the championship match for the Premier Division annually since 2012.

<doc id="662281" wikidata="Q154408" url="?curid=662281" title="Germany women's national football team">
<text>The Germany women&#x27;s national football team () represents Germany in international women&#x27;s football. The team is governed by the German Football Association (DFB).

The Germany national team is one of the most successful in women&#x27;s football. They are two-time world champions, having won the 2003 and 2007 tournaments. The team has won eight of the thirteen UEFA European Championships, claiming six consecutive titles between 1995 and 2013. They, along with the Netherlands, are one of the two nations that have won both the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s European tournament. Also, they and Spain are the only two teams that have won both the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s World Cup tournament. Germany has won Olympic gold in 2016, after three consecutive bronze medals at the Women&#x27;s Olympic Football Tournament, finishing third in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Birgit Prinz holds the record for most appearances and is the team&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer. Prinz has also set international records; she has received the FIFA World Player of the Year award three times and is the joint second overall top goalscorer at the Women&#x27;s World Cup.

Women&#x27;s football was long met with skepticism in Germany, and official matches were banned by the DFB until 1970. However, the women&#x27;s national team has grown in popularity since winning the World Cup in 2003, as it was chosen as Germany&#x27;s Sports Team of the Year. As of December 2024, Germany is ranked third in the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In 1955, the DFB decided to forbid women&#x27;s football in all its clubs in West Germany. In its explanation, the DFB cited that &quot;this combative sport is fundamentally foreign to the nature of women&quot; and that &quot;body and soul would inevitably suffer damage&quot;. Further, the &quot;display of the body violates etiquette and decency&quot;. In spite of this ban, more than 150 unofficial international matches were played in the 1950s and 1960s. On 30 October 1970, the ban on women&#x27;s football was lifted at the DFB annual convention.

Other football associations had already formed official women&#x27;s national teams in the 1970s, the DFB long remained uninvolved in women&#x27;s football. In 1981, DFB official Horst R. Schmidt was invited to send a team to the unofficial women&#x27;s football world championship. Schmidt accepted the invitation but hid the fact that West Germany had no women&#x27;s national team at the time. To avoid humiliation, the DFB sent the German club champions Bergisch Gladbach 09, who went on to win the tournament and repeat the same feat three years later in 1984. Seeing a need, the DFB established the women&#x27;s national team in 1982. DFB president Hermann Neuberger appointed Gero Bisanz, an instructor at the Cologne Sports College, to set up the team.

=== 1982–1994: Difficult beginnings and first European titles ===
In September 1982, Bisanz organised two scouting training courses from which he selected a squad of 16 players. The team&#x27;s first international match took place on 10 November 1982 in Koblenz. Following the tradition of the men&#x27;s team, Switzerland was chosen as West Germany&#x27;s first opponent. Doris Kresimon scored the first international goal in the 25th minute. In the second half, 18-year-old Silvia Neid contributed two goals to the 5–1 victory; Neid later became the assistant coach in 1996 and the head coach in 2005.

With five draws and one defeat, West Germany failed to qualify for the inaugural 1984 European Championship, finishing third in the qualifying group. In the beginning, Bisanz&#x27;s primary objective was to close the gap to the Scandinavian countries and Italy – then the strongest teams in Europe. He emphasized training in basic skills and the need for an effective youth programme. Starting in 1985, Bisanz increasingly called-up younger players, but at first had little success with this concept, as West Germany again failed to qualify for the 1987 European Championship finals.

Undefeated and without conceding a goal, the German team qualified for the European Championship for the first time in 1989; the tournament was played on home soil in West Germany. The semi-final against Italy was the first international women&#x27;s football match shown live on German television. The game was decided by a penalty shootout, in which goalkeeper Marion Isbert saved three penalty kicks and scored the winning penalty herself. On 2 July 1989 in Osnabrück, West Germany played Norway in the final. Before a crowd of 22,000, they beat favourites Norway and won 4–1 with goals from Ursula Lohn, Heidi Mohr and Angelika Fehrmann. This victory marked the team&#x27;s first international title.

After the German reunification, the East German football association joined the DFB. The East German women&#x27;s national football team had played only one official international match, losing 3–0 to Czechoslovakia in a friendly match on 9 May 1990. The unified German team defended their title successfully at the 1991 European Championship. After winning all games in the qualifying group, Germany again met Italy in the semi-final, this time winning 3–0. On 14 July 1991, the German team once more faced Norway in the final. The game went to extra time, during which Heidi Mohr and Silvia Neid scored for Germany and secured the 3–1 victory.

In November 1991, Germany participated in the first Women&#x27;s World Cup in China. Following victories over Nigeria, Taiwan and Italy, the German team reached the quarter-final without conceding a single goal. Silvia Neid scored the first German World Cup goal on 17 November 1991 against Nigeria. Germany won the quarter-final against Denmark 2–1 after extra time, but lost 2–5 in the semi-final to the United States, who went on to win the tournament. Following a 0–4 defeat in the third-place match against Sweden, Germany finished fourth in the tournament.

The German team failed to defend their title at the 1993 European Championship, suffering a semi-final defeat to Italy in a penalty shootout, and later losing 1–3 against Denmark in the third-place playoff. Despite the disappointing result, new talents such as Steffi Jones, Maren Meinert and Silke Rottenberg made their tournament debut and later became key players for the German team.

=== 1995–2002: Olympic and World Cup disappointments ===
Birgit Prinz scored in a major tournament for the first time in 1995. Germany won its third European Championship during the same year. After winning all qualification matches, scoring 55 goals, the German team defeated England 6–2 over two legs in the semi-final. Germany met Sweden in the final, which was played at the Fritz Walter Stadion in Kaiserslautern, Germany, on 26 March 1995. The Swedish team managed to score early, but Germany came back to win 3–2 with goals from Maren Meinert, Prinz and Bettina Wiegmann.

At the 1995 Women&#x27;s World Cup in Sweden, the German team lost against the Scandinavian hosts, but still succeeded in winning their group by beating Japan and Brazil. Germany won the quarter-final against England 3–0, and defeated China 1–0 with a late goal by Bettina Wiegmann in the semi-final. On 18 June 1995 in Stockholm, the German team appeared in their first Women&#x27;s World Cup final. Facing Norway, they lost the match 0–2, but as runners-up achieved their best World Cup result until then.

Women&#x27;s football was first played as an Olympic sport at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Bettina Wiegmann scored the first Olympic goal in the opening match against Japan, which Germany won 3–2. After losing their second group game against Norway 2–3, and drawing with Brazil 1–1, Germany was eliminated, finishing third in the group with four points from three matches. Head coach Gero Bisanz resigned after the tournament and his assistant since 1983, Tina Theune, took over as the new national coach. Silvia Neid ended her playing career and was appointed the new assistant coach.

The 1997 European Championship was the first test for new coach Theune. Following a defeat against Norway, Germany finished second in the qualifying group and only secured qualification by beating Iceland in a relegation play-off. After drawing with Italy and Norway, a victory over Denmark in the last group game saw the German team go through to the knockout stage. They beat Sweden 1–0 in the semi-final, and on 12 July 1997, claimed their fourth European championship with a 2–0 win over Italy, with goals from Sandra Minnert and Birgit Prinz.

At the 1999 Women&#x27;s World Cup in the United States, the German team also failed to qualify directly, but managed to beat Ukraine in a qualifying play-off. Germany started their World Cup campaign by drawing with Italy and winning 6–0 over Mexico. In the last group game, Germany drew 3–3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently had to face the hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President Bill Clinton, the crowd at the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2–3 to the eventual World Cup winners.

Germany competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics, winning all three group games against Australia, Brazil and Sweden. The German team dominated the semi-final against Norway, but lost the game 0–1 after an own goal by Tina Wunderlich in the 80th minute. They beat Brazil 2–0 in the third place match with goals from Birgit Prinz and Renate Lingor, and won the bronze medal. It was the first Olympic medal for the German Football Associations since 1988 when the men&#x27;s team also won bronze.

In 2001, Germany hosted the European Championship. Following victories over Sweden, Russia and England in the group stage, the German team beat Norway 1–0 in the semi-final courtesy of a diving header by Sandra Smisek. On 7 July 2001 in Ulm, they met Sweden in the final, which was played in heavy rain. The game was scoreless after 90 minutes and went to extra time, where Claudia Müller scored a golden goal and secured the fifth European title for Germany.

=== 2003–present: Two consecutive World Cup titles ===

At the 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup in the United States, Germany was drawn in a group with Canada, Japan and Argentina. After winning all three group games, the German team defeated Russia 7–1 in the quarter-final, which set up another clash with the United States. Germany&#x27;s Kerstin Garefrekes scored after 15 minutes and goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg made several key saves. In the dying minutes of the semi-final, Maren Meinert and Birgit Prinz sealed the 3–0 win. On 12 October 2003, Germany met Sweden in the World Cup final in Los Angeles. The Scandinavians went ahead before half time, but Maren Meinert equalized shortly after the break. The game went to extra time, where Nia Künzer headed the winning golden goal in the 98th minute to claim Germany&#x27;s first Women&#x27;s World Cup title. Birgit Prinz was honoured as the tournament&#x27;s best player and top goalscorer.

With wins over China and Mexico, the German team finished first in their group at the 2004 Summer Olympics. They beat Nigeria 2–1 in the quarter-final, but suffered a 1–2 semi-final loss to the United States after extra time. In the third place match, Germany defeated Sweden 1–0 with a goal by Renate Lingor, winning the team&#x27;s second Olympic bronze medal.

The 2005 European Championship was held in England. With wins over Norway, Italy and France in Round 1, the German team advanced to the semi-final, where they defeated Finland 4–1. On 19 June 2005, they met Norway for the third time in the European championship final. Germany won 3–1 with goals from Inka Grings, Renate Lingor and Birgit Prinz and added a sixth European title. Head coach Tina Theune stepped down after the tournament and her assistant Silvia Neid took over as national coach. In 2006, Germany won the annual Algarve Cup for the first time.

As reigning world champion, Germany played the opening game at the 2007 Women&#x27;s World Cup in China, outclassing Argentina 11–0. After a goalless draw against England and a 2–0 win over Japan, the German team defeated North Korea 3–0 in the quarter-final. They beat Norway by the same result in the semi-final, with goals from Kerstin Stegemann, Martina Müller and a Norwegian own goal. On 30 September 2007, Germany faced Brazil in the World Cup final in Shanghai. Birgit Prinz put Germany in front after half time and goalkeeper Nadine Angerer saved a penalty by Brazilian Marta. Simone Laudehr scored a second goal after 86 minutes, which sealed the German 2–0 victory. Germany was the first team (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s game) to win the World Cup without conceding a goal and the first to successfully defend the Women&#x27;s World Cup title. With 14 goals, Prinz became the tournament&#x27;s overall top goalscorer.

In a replay of the 2007 World Cup final, the German team drew 0–0 with Brazil in the opening game at the 2008 Summer Olympics. They then beat both Nigeria and North Korea to advance to the quarter-final, where they defeated Sweden 2–0 after extra time. In the semi-final, Germany again met Brazil. Birgit Prinz scored in the 10th minute, but the German team lost 1–4 after conceding three goals to Brazilian counter-attacks in the second half. They beat Japan 2–0 for the bronze medal, with Fatmire Bajramaj scoring both goals. The third consecutive semi-final loss at the Olympics was seen as a disappointment by both the players and the German press. The team&#x27;s overall performance and head coach Silvia Neid were harshly criticised in the media.

Germany qualified for the 2009 European Championship in Finland winning all eight games and scoring 34 goals. They beat Norway, France and Iceland in the group stage to advance to the quarter-final, where they won 2–1 against Italy. After trailing Norway at half-time in the semi-final, the German team fought back to a 3–1 victory. On 10 September 2009, they defeated England 6–2 for their seventh European trophy. Birgit Prinz and Inka Grings scored twice, with Melanie Behringer and Kim Kulig also scoring. Grings retained her award as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer from 2005, while Germany extended their winning streak at the European Championship finals to a 19-match run dating back to 1997.

Germany hosted the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup and won the three games on the group stage, over Canada, France and Nigeria. On the quarterfinals, the team suffered an upset by Japan, who won on overtime with a goal by Karina Maruyama. The defeat broke the Germans&#x27; streak of sixteen undefeated games at the World Cup. By failing to finish among the top two UEFA teams, Germany was unable to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

At the 2013 European Championship in Sweden, the Germans won their sixth straight continental title, with the decisive game being a 1–0 victory over Norway. Goalkeeper Nadine Angerer, who stopped two penalties during the final, was chosen as the tournament&#x27;s best player. The 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup had Germany again reaching the top four. In the semi-final against the United States, Célia Šašić, who wound up as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, missed a penalty, and afterwards goals by Carli Lloyd and Kelley O&#x27;Hara lead to an American victory. The third place match saw the Germans lose their first ever match to England after 21 contests, due to a penalty kick by Fara Williams during extra time.

At the 2019 Women&#x27;s World Cup Germany were in Group B with China PR, South Africa, and Spain. They topped the group with three wins and defeated Nigeria in the Round of 16. Germany was eliminated by Sweden in the quarter-finals, losing to them for the first time in 24 years and conceding their only goals of the tournament and so failed to qualify for the Olympic football tournament of Tokyo 2020.

At the 2022 European Championship, Germany reached the final, where the team lost 1–2 after extra time against the host of the tournament, England. For Germany, the record winners of the competition, this was their ninth appearance in a Euro final and the first in which they were defeated.

Germany entered the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup as one of the title favourites, being second in the FIFA Rankings at the time. Drawn into Group H alongside Morocco, Colombia, and South Korea, they seemed to have a strong start after defeating Morocco 6–0. However, they would lose to Colombia 2–1. After tying with South Korea 1–1 alongside Morocco&#x27;s 1–0 victory against Colombia, they were eliminated and missed the knockout stage for the first time in their history. This was widely described as one of the biggest upsets in the history of the Women&#x27;s World Cup.

== Team image ==

=== Nicknames ===
The Germany women&#x27;s national football team has been known or nicknamed as &quot;&quot;Die Nationalelf&quot; (The National Eleven)&quot;.

=== Kits and crest ===

The German women&#x27;s national football team wears white shirts with black shorts and white socks, following the tradition of the German men&#x27;s team – black and white are the colours of Prussia. The current change kit is all dark green. In the past, Germany also used green shirts with white shorts and green socks as the away kit, as well as a red and black kit, with black shorts and red socks.

The women&#x27;s national team originally played with the emblem of the German men&#x27;s team, a variation of the DFB logo with the Federal Eagle of Germany (&quot;Bundesadler&quot;) and three stars at the top for the men&#x27;s 1954, 1974 and 1990 World Cup titles. Since their first Women&#x27;s World Cup win in 2003, the team displays its own World Cup titles; initially with one star, and since 2007, with two stars at the top of the emblem. While being reigning world champions, Germany also displayed the newly created &quot;FIFA Women&#x27;s World Champions Badge&quot; on their shirts from 2009 until 2011 when they were succeeded by Japan.

In accordance with the rules of the International Olympic Committee, Germany does not wear its official uniform with the logo of the German Football Association while competing at the Summer Olympics. Instead, the DFB badge is replaced by the coat of arms of Germany. Like all DFB squads, the women&#x27;s national team is supplied by Adidas. The team&#x27;s main sponsor is the German insurance company Allianz.

=== Home stadium ===

The Germany national football team has no national stadium. Like the men, the women&#x27;s team play their home matches in different stadiums throughout the country. As of June 2011, they have played in 87 different German cities. Most home games have been held in Osnabrück with six matches, followed by Ulm (five games), and Bochum, Kaiserslautern, Koblenz, Lüdenscheid, Rheine, Siegen and Weil am Rhein (three games each). The first home match in former East Germany was played in Aue in May 1991.

In the 1980s and 1990s, home matches were mostly played in smaller towns with no professional football clubs. As the team became more successful, especially after the World Cup win in 2003, the number of spectators rose accordingly.

The record attendance for Germany was 73,680 in the 2011 Women&#x27;s World Cup opening game against Canada at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. That game also set a new European record in women&#x27;s football. Away from home, the team&#x27;s crowd record was 54,642 in the 1999 Women&#x27;s World Cup quarter-final against the United States at the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover.

=== Acceptance and popularity ===

For most of the 20th century, women&#x27;s football was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. The 2003 World Cup title marked the breakthrough for the women&#x27;s national football team in Germany. The final was watched by 10.48 million viewers on German television (a 33.2 percent market share) and the German team was welcomed home by almost 10,000 fans at Frankfurt&#x27;s city hall. Later that year, they were honoured as the 2003 German Sports Team of the Year. Nia Künzer&#x27;s World Cup winning golden goal was voted Germany&#x27;s 2003 Goal of the Year, the first time the award was won by a female player. Each member of the World Cup squad received a prearranged bonus of 15,000 euros for winning the tournament; four years later the players received 50,000 euros for their successful title defense. Since 2005, almost all of the women&#x27;s national football team&#x27;s matches have been shown live on German television. In 2009, one million of the 6.7 million DFB members were female.

The final of the 2007 Women&#x27;s World Cup was seen by 9.05 million television viewers (a 50.5 percent market share). After the team returned to Germany, they were celebrated by a crowd of 20,000 in Frankfurt. In December 2007, all players of the World Cup squad received the Silberne Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), the highest state decoration for athletes in Germany. National coach Silvia Neid was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit on ribbon by German president Horst Köhler.

Women&#x27;s football is one of the fastest growing sports in Germany. Attendance for the women&#x27;s Bundesliga more than tripled in one year, with an average of 806 in 2022 to an average of 2,723 in 2023.

In 2022 the most watched sporting event on German TV with nearly 18 million people watching was the women&#x27;s national team final of the Euros against England. The following year the women kept more views than the men&#x27;s team with 10.37 million television viewers.

Christian Wück is the current head coach of the German women&#x27;s national football team. The coach&#x27;s official title is &quot;DFB-Trainer&quot; and he or she is employed by the German Football Association.

*Gero Bisanz (1982–1996) was the first coach of the women&#x27;s national team. He selected his first squad in September 1982. At the same time, he also worked as the chief instructor for DFB coaching training from 1971 to 2000. Bisanz led the German team to three European Championships in 1989, 1991 and 1995. Under Bisanz, Germany also was runners-up at the 1995 Women&#x27;s World Cup. He resigned after the German team was eliminated in Round 1 at the 1996 Summer Olympics. With his assistant since 1983, Tina Theune, he built a scouting system and was responsible for a new DFB youth programme.
*Tina Theune (1996–2005) took over as head coach after the 1996 Summer Olympics. She was the first woman to acquire the highest German football coaching license. Theune was responsible for three European Championship titles in 1997, 2001 and 2005. During her time as head coach, Germany won the bronze medal at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. Her biggest success was the 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup title. Theune is the most successful national coach to date. She benefited from an effective youth programme and integrated several Under-19 players into the nation team. Theune stepped down after winning the European Championship in 2005.
*Silvia Neid (2005–2016) was the team&#x27;s assistant coach from 1996 to 2005 and the head coach of the German Under-19 team, winning the 2004 U-19 Women&#x27;s World Championship. In July 2005, she became the team&#x27;s head coach and the 2006 Algarve Cup marked her first tournament win. By winning the 2007 Women&#x27;s World Cup, Neid became the first Germany national team coach of either gender to win the World Cup at the first attempt. At her first Summer Olympics as a coach in 2008, Germany won the bronze medal for a third time. Neid was also responsible for Germany&#x27;s seventh European Championship in 2009. She coached the Germany national team until 2016 and her assistant was Ulrike Ballweg.
* On 30 March 2015, DFB announced that Steffi Jones (2016–2018) would become the new German head coach in 2016.
* Horst Hrubesch (2018) took over as the interim head coach from March to November 2018.

== Records ==

:&quot;Players in bold are still active at national team level.&quot;

Birgit Prinz, a former team captain who retired after the 2011 World Cup, holds the record for Germany for appearances, having played 214 times from 1994 to 2011. She is one of 21 German players to have reached 100 caps. Kerstin Stegemann is second, having played 191 times. Bettina Wiegmann, Germany&#x27;s team captain during the 2003 World Cup win, comes fourth with 154 games. Prinz exceeded Wiegmann&#x27;s record as the most capped player in November 2006. Prinz also held the record for most appearances by a European player until 15 June 2021, when she was surpassed by Sweden&#x27;s Caroline Seger.

Wiegmann and Prinz have successively been awarded the title of honorary captain of the German women&#x27;s national football team.

The title of Germany&#x27;s highest goalscorer is also held by Prinz. She scored her first goal in July 1994 against Canada and finished her career with 128 goals (averaging 0.60 goals per game). Heidi Mohr, as well as being the second-highest scorer, is also the most prolific with 83 goals coming from 104 games (averaging 0.80 goals per game). Two players share the record for goals scored in one match: Conny Pohlers scored five goals in October 2001 against Portugal, and Inka Grings scored five times in February 2004, again facing Portugal. Silvia Neid, the former Germany national coach, is the sixth highest goalscorer with 48 goals in 111 games.

The largest margin of victory achieved by Germany is 17–0 against Kazakhstan during a European Championship qualifying game in November 2011. The record defeat, a 6–0 loss against the United States, occurred during a friendly match in March 1996.

Former goalkeeper Nadine Angerer has the most appearances for a goalkeeper, with 145 games as goal keeper (89 without conceding a goal) and one game as a substitute as defender.
Silke Rottenberg is second with 126 caps and 68 games without conceding a goal. Bettina Wiegmann holds the record of 14 goals from penalty kicks; Renate Lingor comes in second with 8 goals. Tina Wunderlich scored the team&#x27;s only own goal in the semi-final of the 2000 Summer Olympics against Norway; it was the game&#x27;s only goal.

The German team also holds several international records. In 2007, they were the first to win two consecutive Women&#x27;s World Cup titles and they achieved the then-biggest win in tournament history by beating Argentina 11–0, Germany is also the only team to win the women&#x27;s World Cup without conceding a goal and the only country to win both World Cups. With 14 goals, Prinz became the overall top goalscorer at the Women&#x27;s World Cup in 2007, and she and Brazilian Marta are the only women to have received the FIFA World Player of the Year award at least three times.

== Competitive record ==

=== FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup ===

Germany is one of the most successful nations at the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, having won the tournament twice and finishing runner-up once. The German team won the World Cup in 2003 and 2007. At the first World Cup in 1991, they finished in fourth place. In 1995, Germany reached the World Cup final, but were defeated by Norway. The team&#x27;s worst result was a Group stage exit in 2023. Overall, the German team has appeared in three Women&#x27;s World Cup finals, and is a five-time semi-finalist. They have participated in every Women&#x27;s World Cup and have a 31–6–10 win–draw–loss record.

:&quot;**Gold background colour indicates that the tournament was won.&quot;
:&quot;***Red border colour indicates tournament was held on home soil.&quot;

=== Olympic Games ===
Women&#x27;s football debuted at the 1996 Summer Olympics and Bettina Wiegmann scored the first Olympic goal in the opening game of the tournament. However, Germany failed to progress to the knockout stage and was eliminated in the group stages. Four years later the German team won the bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics. They again finished third at both the 2004 and the 2008 Summer Olympics.

The German team qualified for all Women&#x27;s Olympic Football Tournaments until 2008. However, they failed to qualify for the 2012 tournament as UEFA used the 2011 World Cup for qualification, and Germany ended below France and Sweden. The German team beat Sweden in the Olympics final in Rio in 2016 to obtain their first Olympic gold medal.

=== UEFA Women&#x27;s Championship ===

Germany failed to qualify for the first two UEFA European Championships in 1984 and 1987. Since 1989, the German team has participated in every tournament and is the record European champion with eight titles. Germany has won six consecutive championships from 1995 to 2013 and has an overall finals record of 36 wins, 6 draws, and 4 losses.

<text>The IBM 5110 Computing System is the successor of the IBM 5100 Portable Computer.

The IBM 5110 was announced in January 1978 (a little over 2 years after the introduction of the IBM 5100). Its main differences were support for more I/O devices (floppy disk drives, IEEE-488, RS-232) and a character set (EBCDIC) which was compatible with other IBM machines. These improvements made it partially incompatible with the IBM 5100.

==Variations==
Three variations of the IBM 5110 were built:
* IBM 5110 Model 1 (with a built-in QIC DC300 tape drive of 204 kB)
* IBM 5110 Model 2 (without the QIC tape drive)
* IBM 5110 Model 3 - also designated as the IBM 5120 (with two built-in 8-inch 1.2 MB floppy disk drives)

==Description==
The 5110 featured the same housing as the 5100 (although the colors were different), which contained an IBM PALM processor, a keyboard and a 1,024-character display screen. Main memory held 16, 32, 48 or 64 KB of data, depending on the unit. Offering either magnetic tape or diskette storage, the Model 1 could store as much as 204,000 bytes of information per tape cartridge or 1.2 MB on a single 8&quot; diskette; the Model 2 allowed only diskette storage. Up to two IBM 5114 diskette units, each housing a maximum of two 8&quot; diskette drives, could be attached to the 5110 for a total online diskette capacity of 4.8 MB. The IBM 5110 Model 3 allowed only one external IBM 5114 diskette unit. IBM did not offer a LAN or hard disk drive for these systems. However, in 1981 Hal Prewitt, founder of Core International, Inc invented and marketing the world&#x27;s first and only hard disk subsystems and &quot;CoreNet&quot;, a LAN used to share programs and data for the IBM 5110 and 5120 systems.

An IBM 5103 printer and an external IBM 5106 auxiliary tape unit (Model 1 only) were available as options from IBM.

Citing the easy use of his new system, Jeff Grube, vice president of Punxsutawney Electric Repair (who received the first IBM 5110 on February 2, 1978), said: &quot;If you can type and use a hand-held calculator, you have all the skills necessary to operate a 5110.&quot;

==Programming languages==
The 5110 was available with either APL or BASIC—or both—programming languages. Machines that supported both languages provided a toggle switch on the front panel to select the language. 

In 1984, Core International, Inc introduced PC51, software that allowed 5100 Series computer programs written in BASIC to run unmodified on the IBM PC and compatibles under PC DOS and share programs and data on CoreNet, the LAN for all these models.

==5110 Software==
The 5110, designed by the Global Software Development team at IBM Rochester in Rochester, Minnesota, was aimed at GSD&#x27;s traditional commercial market. The machine was brought in only 90 days from conception to production. It achieved this short timescale under the management of Bill Sydnes, who as a member of Bill Lowe&#x27;s taskforce later did much the same for the IBM PC. As a business system, IBM offered a number of basic accounting software for a small business. However, companies such as Core International, Inc designed and supported a wide assortment of application programs.

==Model 3==
The IBM 5110 Model 3 (also known as the IBM 5120 Computing System) was the desktop version of the 5110.

The 5110 was withdrawn from marketing in March 1982 but IBM continued to support the series until the mid 80s.

<text>The IBM 5120 Computing System (sometimes referred to as the IBM 5110 Model 3) is a 16-bit microcomputer developed by IBM and released in February 1980. Marketed as the desktop follow-on to the portable IBM 5110 Computing System, it featured two built-in 8-inch 1.2 MB floppy disk drives, an integrated 9-inch monochrome monitor, 32 KB RAM, plus an optional IBM 5114 stand-alone diskette unit with two additional 8-inch 1.2 MB floppy disk drives.

The system was sold with both APL and BASIC languages in ROM, and provided a toggle switch on the front panel to select the language. APL allowed numerous business software written on IBM minicomputers to run on the 5120.

==Description==
It was launched in 1980 as the lowest-priced IBM business computer to date. Depending on the options the overall system prices ranged from $9,340 to $23,990. To emphasize its office image IBM released in that same year 6 new programs: task inventory, billing, payroll, accounts payable, accounts receivable and general ledger accounting. 

Aside from larger screen size and performance benefits over its predecessor, the IBM 5120 design incorporated several usability advantages:
* Reduced &#x27;footprint&#x27; requiring less desktop space
* Reduced glare on monitor, keytop and product surfaces
* Ease of handling/lifting based on bottom form treatment
* Reduced static loading in arms and shoulders due to keyboard palm rest

For its usability features and appearance, the IBM 5120 was recognized with two major industrial design awards and described with terms such as &quot;clean, well thought out&quot;; &quot;subtle detailing shows great care in execution&quot;; and &quot;looks like quality.

IBM did not offer a LAN or hard disk drive for these systems. However, in 1981, Hal Prewitt, founder of Core International, Inc, invented and marketed the world&#x27;s first and only hard disk subsystems and &quot;CoreNet&quot;, a LAN used to share programs and data for the IBM 5110 and 5120 systems. In 1984, Core introduced PC51, software that allowed 5100 Series computer programs written in BASIC to run unmodified on the IBM PC and compatibles under PC DOS and share programs and data on CoreNet, the LAN for all these models.

<text>Blizzard North (formerly known as Condor) was an American video game development studio based in San Mateo, California. The studio was the Bay Area division of Blizzard Entertainment, known for its &quot;Diablo&quot; series. The company was originally based in Redwood City, California, before moving a short distance away to San Mateo, with Blizzard proper being based in Irvine, southern California.

==History==
Blizzard North was founded in 1993 under the name Condor by David Brevik, Erich Schaefer and Max Schaefer at the request of Brevik. The three had met while working at FM Waves, a clip art production studio which had gone defunct, and the trio initially used equipment scavenged from the closure of FM Waves. Brevik had found that the Schaefers shared an interest in gaming, and established Condor to follow on Brevik&#x27;s concept for a dungeon crawler game based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; but with roguelike gameplay. David Brevik served as the president of the company between 1993 and 2003, while the Schaefer brothers held the Vice President positions in the company. 

The company was purchased and renamed as Blizzard North by Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s former owner Davidson &amp; Associates about nine months before the release of their hit PC game &quot;Diablo&quot; in 1997. However, Blizzard North had complete autonomy from Blizzard Entertainment while David Brevik and the Schaefer brothers continued to manage the company respectively as the President and Vice Presidents. &quot;Diablo&quot; was highly successful, and its 2000 sequel &quot;Diablo II&quot; even more so. An expansion pack, &quot;Diablo II: Lord of Destruction&quot;, followed the year after.

By June 2003 two new games were in production. The first game in production was Blizzard North&#x27;s version of &quot;Diablo III&quot; which later was scrapped and restarted by Blizzard Entertainment. The second was a &quot;Diablo&quot;-like game which would take place in space, dubbed &quot;Starblo&quot; by the studio. In the wake of rumors that Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s owner, Vivendi, was looking to sell its game division, the heads of Blizzard North demanded to their management to request assurance for financial protection in the wake of this rumor. Several rounds of tense communication between the companies followed. On June 30, 2003, leadership from Vivendi and Blizzard Entertainment met with the heads of Blizzard North, from which David Brevik, the Schaefer brothers and Bill Roper tendered their resignations. Blizzard Entertainment then announced further layoffs, cancelled work on &quot;Starblo&quot;, and directed the remaining team to focus on &quot;Diablo III&quot;. Of those that were laid off, eight moved to form Flagship Studios, including Brevik, the Schaefer brothers and Roper. Another nine employees left to form Castaway Entertainment. By the time the exodus concluded, around 30 employees had left the company.

On August 1, 2005, Blizzard Entertainment announced the closure of Blizzard North. A key reason for the closure was Blizzard North&#x27;s poor development of what was to be &quot;Diablo III&quot;, which did not meet Vivendi&#x27;s expectations. Former Blizzard North staffers including Joseph Lawrence, Wyatt Cheng, and Matt Uelmen subsequently appeared in the credits of Blizzard&#x27;s next retail release, &quot;World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade&quot;. The work of former Blizzard North artist Phroilan Gardner was featured in editions of &quot;World of Warcraft: The Trading Card Game&quot; around the same time.

A few employees from the &quot;Diablo&quot; team, including Eric Sexton, Michio Okamura, and Steven Woo, organized to launch a new company, Hyboreal Games.

=== Castaway Entertainment ===
Castaway Entertainment was established by former employees of Blizzard North, and was also based in Redwood City, California. The company signed a publishing agreement with Electronic Arts in March 2004, but had yet to produce any products for that publisher when it was shut down in 2008.

Former Blizzard North members who joined the studio include Michael Scandizzo, Stefan Scandizzo, Alan Ackerman, Steven Woo, Rick Seis, Ted Bisson, Bruno Bowden, Peter Brevik, Michael Huang, Kelly Johnson (artist), Michio Okamura, Tom Ricket (also known as Sluggy Freelance&#x27;s Shirt Guy Tom), and Fredrick Vaught (after whom the Halls of Vaught in Diablo II were named).

Other notable employees include game designer Bill Dunn and art director Rick Macaraeg.

On April 4, 2008, Michael Scandizzo announced that Castaway was suspending operations due to financial problems.

=== Moon Beast Productions ===
Moon Beast Productions, founded circa 2023 by industry veterans from Blizzard North, is an independent game development studio dedicated to revitalizing the action role-playing game (ARPG) genre. With decades of experience from iconic titles like Diablo, Diablo II, and Torchlight, the team at Moon Beast Productions aims to innovate and expand upon traditional ARPG mechanics. Key Blizzard North staff members, including Erich Schaefer, Peter Hu and Phil Shenk, are part of this new venture. Their upcoming projects promise to introduce new gameplay elements and user-generated content, offering fresh and dynamic experiences for players.

<doc id="662291" wikidata="Q5212707" url="?curid=662291" title="Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover">
<text>&quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot; is a song written and performed by American singer-songwriter Sophie B. Hawkins. Released in March 1992 as the first single from her debut album, &quot;Tongues and Tails&quot; (1992), the song achieved success in many countries worldwide; in the United States, it reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also reached the top 10 in six other countries, including Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, and Norway. In the United Kingdom, the single peaked at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Hawkins&#x27; second-most successful song on that chart after &quot;Right Beside You&quot;, which reached number 13 in 1994. There were made two different versions of the music video for the song, after the first version was banned from MTV for its erotic content.

==Background and composition==
The song&#x27;s lyrics are written from the perspective of a woman who is observing another woman in an abusive relationship. Hawkins has explicitly stated that she is what she terms &quot;omnisexual&quot;, which means that a lover&#x27;s gender does not matter to her. The song encourages people to be open-minded about this as well, with the line &quot;Free your mind and you won&#x27;t feel ashamed&quot;, which is meant to combat homophobia and queerphobia. The homoerotic nature of the song was rare at the time, as not many songs dealt with the erotic or romantic love between two women, but it was not picked up on by a large group of listeners, and it is still glossed over in many articles discussing lesbian representation in love songs.

==Critical reception==
Roch Parisien from AllMusic described the song as &quot;hook-filled mainstream pop&quot;. Upon the release, Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;Hawkins proves to be a star-in-the-making, delivering a charming vocal over a hypnotic, rock/hip-hop beat. Contagious, sing-along chorus renders tune an unlikely anthem, but one that deserves every bit of airplay it gets.&quot; Clark and DeVaney from &quot;Cash Box&quot; felt that the singer-songwriter &quot;has a sexy, breathy and slightly vulnerable sound&quot;. Stephanie Zacharek from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; remarked that in the &quot;killer single&quot; &quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot;, &quot;Hawkins says those words as insouciantly as if she’d just broken a nail. But she still lets you know they mean a hell of a lot more to her than that.&quot; Dave Sholin from the &quot;Gavin Report&quot; stated, &quot;When 1992 is done and gone, we&#x27;ll likely remember the debut of this singer/songwriter from New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side as one of the year&#x27;s musical highlights.&quot; He added, &quot;It&#x27;s not often when programmer consensus is this strong on a new song by an unknown artist, but in this case, it&#x27;s totally justified. It&#x27;s one of those that is instantly obvious seconds after it starts.&quot;

Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; said, &quot;Listen to the extremely strong chorus to this pop song, and you&#x27;ll understand why.&quot; Alan Jones from &quot;Music Week&quot; named it Pick of the Week, writing, &quot;Brooklyn babe&#x27;s self-penned multi-textured and multi-format debut is a compelling confection. Soulfully shuffling and coyly chiming, it&#x27;s armed with a killer hook, and knows it. A curious early fade threatens, before Sophie builds it up again.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;People Magazine&quot; noted, &quot;When a record opens with a song called &quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot;, you realize immediately you&#x27;re not dealing with some delicate flower. Hawkins knows what she wants, and she knows how to get it.&quot; In a retrospective review, Pop Rescue stated that &quot;this is a wonderfully breathy song which builds well in the chorus and adds more instruments into the second verse.&quot; Jonathan Bernstein from &quot;Spin&quot; wrote, &quot;Not only was her lubricious lament, &quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot;, the year&#x27;s stand-alone Great White Pop Single, but it neatly supplanted &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot; as the phrase on the nation&#x27;s lips.&quot;

==Music video==
The original music video for the song featured Hawkins lying on her back in a flowing, light-fabric outfit while singing the song, interspersed with scenes of dancers and of Hawkins kneeling down while wearing a combination of a tube top and daisy dukes. At the time, television network MTV banned the original version for its erotic content; moreover, Sony Music Entertainment (SME) was still repeatedly banning it from YouTube &quot;on copyright grounds&quot; as of late June 2017. A new video was shot, after the MTV ban, that showed Hawkins in a more conservative outfit of jeans and a flannel shirt, performing the song on a stage together with a band. While the new video was shot entirely in black and white, a significant portion of the original video was in colour (though there were scenes in black and white as well, with some artificial colouring used to artistically enhance the material). A portion of this original video is featured in the documentary &quot;The Cream Will Rise.&quot; Both video versions used the shorter radio version.

==Impact and legacy==
&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed &quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot; at number 100 in their ranking of &quot;The 100 Best Singles of the 1990s&quot; in 2011, writing, 

&quot;Time Out&quot; placed it at number 45 in their list of &quot;The 50 Best Gay Songs to Celebrate Pride All Year Long&quot; in 2022.

<doc id="662294" wikidata="Q27855" url="?curid=662294" title="Blue mussel">
<text>The blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), also known as the common mussel, is a medium-sized edible marine bivalve mollusc in the family Mytilidae, the only extant family in the order Mytilida, known as &quot;true mussels&quot;. Blue mussels are subject to commercial use and intensive aquaculture. A species with a large range, empty shells are commonly found on beaches around the world.

==Systematics and distribution==

===The &quot;Mytilus edulis&quot; complex===
Systematically blue mussel consists of a group of (at least) three closely related taxa of mussels, known as the &quot;Mytilus edulis&quot; complex. Collectively they occupy both coasts of the North Atlantic (including the Mediterranean) and of the North Pacific in temperate to polar waters, as well as coasts of similar nature in the Southern Hemisphere. The distribution of the component taxa has been recently modified as a result of human activity. The taxa can hybridise with each other, if present at the same locality.

*&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot; sensu stricto: Native to the North Atlantic.
*&quot;Mytilus galloprovincialis&quot;, the Mediterranean mussel: Native in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and Western Europe. Introduced in the temperate North Pacific, South Africa and elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. 
*&quot;Mytilus planulatus&quot;, the New Zealand blue mussel, a distinct lineage native to the Southern Hemisphere along the southern coast of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand 
*&quot;Mytilus platensis&quot; (junior synonym &quot;M. chilensis&quot;), the Chilean mussel: Temperate and sub-Antarctic waters of South America and the Kerguelen Islands.
*&quot;Mytilus trossulus&quot;: North Pacific, northern parts of the North Atlantic, Baltic Sea.

===&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot;, strict sense===
The Atlantic blue mussel is native on the North American Atlantic coast, but is found intermixed with &quot;M. trossulus&quot; north of Maine. In Atlantic Canada, &quot;M. trossulus&quot; was found to have smaller shell growth values than &quot;M. edulis&quot; and contain less meat than &quot;M. edulis.&quot; Keeping this in mind, &quot;M. edulis,&quot; under raft culture conditions, is estimated to have an economic value of 1.7 times &quot;M. trossulus.&quot; In Europe it is found from French Atlantic coast northwards to Novaya Zemlya and Iceland, but not in the Baltic Sea. In France and in the British Isles, it makes hybrid zones with &quot;M. galloprovincialis&quot;, and also is sometimes intermixed with &quot;M. trossulus&quot;.

The genetically distinct lineage of &quot;M. edulis&quot; present in the Southern Hemisphere has been attributed to subspecies &quot;Mytilus edulis platensis&quot; (now &quot;Mytilus platensis&quot;).

==Habitat==


Blue mussels are boreo-temperate invertebrates that live in intertidal areas attached to rocks and other hard substrates by strong (and somewhat elastic) thread-like structures called byssal threads, secreted by byssal glands located in the foot of the mussel.

==Description==
The shape of the shell is triangular and elongated with rounded edges. The shell is smooth with a sculpturing of fine concentric growth lines but no radiating ribs. The shells of this species are purple, blue or sometimes brown in color, occasionally with radial stripes. The outer surface of the shell is covered by the periostracum which as eroded, exposes the colored prismatic calcitic layer. Blue Mussels are semi-sessile, having the ability to detach and reattach to a surface allowing the mollusk to reposition itself relative to the water position.

&lt;/div align=center&gt;

==Reproduction==
Mussels have separate sexes. Once the sperm and eggs are fully developed they are released into the water column for fertilization. Although there are about 10,000 sperm per egg, large proportions of eggs deposited by blue mussels are never fertilized. As few as 1% of larvae that do mature ever reach adulthood. The majority are eaten by predators before completing metamorphosis.

The reproductive strategy seen in blue mussels is characteristic of planktotrophs. By minimizing nutrients in egg production to the bare minimum they are able to maximize the number of gametes produced. If the adult mussels are stressed during the beginning of gametogenesis, the process is terminated. When stressed while fresh gametes are present, adult mussels reabsorb gametes. Larvae viability is also affected by the condition of parents: high water temperatures, pollutants and scarcity of food, during gamete production. The reduction in viability is probably due to the lack of lipid reserves distributed to the eggs.

==Monitor of environmental DNA damage==

Blue mussels are used for monitoring marine pollution based on their tendency to accumulate numerous pollutants from their natural environment. Upon &quot;in vivo&quot; exposure of blue mussels (&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot;) to either of two metals of environmental concern, cadmium or chromium, it was found that both of these metals induce DNA strand breakage, and also impair different DNA repair capacities in the tissues of these mussels.

==Larval development==
Larval development can last from 15 to 35 days depending environmental conditions including salinity and temperature, as well as location. Larvae originating from Connecticut mature normally at , though at normal development occurs at salinities between 15 and 35 ppt and at 35 ppt at .

The first stage of development is the ciliated embryo, which in 24-hours for fertilization form the trochophore. At this point although mobile, it is still reliant on the yolk for nutrients. Characterized by a functional mouth and alimentary canal the veliger stage also has cilia which are used for filtering food as well as propulsion. A thin translucent shell is secreted by the shell gland forming the notable straight hinge of the prodissoconch I shell. The veliger continues to mature forming the prodissoconch II shell. In the end stage of veliger development photosensitive eye spots and elongated foot with a byssal gland are formed.

Once the pediveliger is fully developed, its foot extends and makes contact with substrate. The initial contact with the substrate is loose. If the substrate is suitable, the larva will metamorphoses into the juvenile form, plantigrade, and attach byssus threads. The mussel will remain in that state until reaching 1-1.5mm in length. This attachment is the prerequisite for the foundation for the blue mussel population. In sheltered environments large masses sometimes form beds which offer shelter and food for other invertebrates. Byssal thread are secreted by byssal glands located in the foot of the mussel, and are made up of polyphenolic proteins which serve as a bioadhesive.

==Aggregation and mussel bed formation==

Blue mussels often form aggregations, where they attach to each other using byssus threads. These are collagenous protein strands used for attachment. The type of aggregation depends on population densities. When densities are low, for example in mussel fields – short-lived mussel populations – clumped distribution patterns are seen. The rate of aggregation is aided by the presence of predator cues.

Several explanations for aggregate formation have been offered, such as increase of reproductive success in low density populations, resisting of wave action, and defence against predators. It is, however, still unclear what the main purpose is and aggregation might have different purposes under different circumstances. 

Mussel beds are persistent, dense mussel populations. Beds generally form from fields that persist long enough to establish a dense population. In high density aggregations, growth of blue mussels at the centre of the aggregation is reduced, likely due to a reduction in food availability. When possible, mussels will thus migrate to lower densities on larger scales (&gt;7.5 cm), but aggregate on small scales (&lt;2.0 cm). In areas where blue mussels are threatened, such as the Wadden Sea, it is of great importance to enhance the survival of mussel fields, of which mussel aggregates are the primary component.

==Predators==
Predation of blue mussels is greatest during the three weeks it spends as a planktonic larva. During this stage it is susceptible to jellyfish and fish larvae through adults. Once it metamorphoses the mussel is still restricted by predation, with smaller mussels with thinner, weaker shells most affected. Once the shells becomes stronger, blue mussels are preyed upon by sea stars such as &quot;Asterias vulgaris&quot; as well as by several species of sea gulls. The capability of shell thickening by mussels has become a very effective defense mechanism. In the presence of predators a mussel is able to increase shell thickness 5 to 10 percent, which in turn makes opening the shell take 50 percent more time. Small mussels are also eaten by the dog whelk, &quot;Nucella lapillus&quot;. The blue mussel is host to a wide range of parasites, but these parasites usually do not cause much damage. 
Blue Mussels are able to fight off one species of predator at a time such as sea star (&quot;Asterias rubens&quot; (=&quot;Asterias vulgaris&quot;)) or green crabs (&quot;Carcinus maenas&quot;). They use their inducible defenses to strengthen their adductor muscle or grow thicker shells. When faced with two species at a time, they are no longer able to use their defenses and can be killed more easily.

==Uses and ecosystem services==
Blue mussels are filter feeders and play a vital role in estuaries by removing bacteria and toxins.
&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot; is commonly harvested for food throughout the world, from both wild and farmed sources. Mussels are a staple of many seafood dishes in various cuisines including Spanish (especially Galician), Portuguese, French, British, Dutch, Belgian, Italian and Turkey as midye dolma. They are also commonly used as lab animals. Blue mussels were also harvested by the indigenous peoples of North America.

Blue mussels are starting to decline in areas such as the Gulf of Maine. Historical references have shown a decrease of about 40 percent in the last fifty years. This can cause a future problem because mussels are foundation species providing homes and protecting other small animals in the intertidal zone like small fish as well as filtering the water. Mussels filter out bacteria, metals, and toxins, that would increase significantly without mussels around. Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is projected to reduce the growth and survival of blue mussels; in turn, this could drastically reduce their positive impact on coastal water quality.

<text>Lake Te Anau () is in the southwestern corner of the South Island of New Zealand. The lake covers an area of , making it the second-largest lake by surface area in New Zealand (after Lake Taupō) and the largest in the South Island. It is the second largest lake in Australasia by fresh water volume.
The main body of the lake runs north-south, and is 65 km in length. Three large fiords form arms to the lake on its western flank: North Fiord, Middle Fiord and South Fiord. These are the only inland fiords that New Zealand has, the other 14 are out on the coast. Several small islands lie in the entrance to Middle Fiord, which forks partway along its length into northwest and southwest arms. The surface of the lake is at an altitude of 210 m. It has a maximum depth of 425 m, so much of its bed lies below sea level, with the deepest part of the lake being 215 metres below sea level.

Several rivers feed the lake, of which the most important is the Eglinton River, which joins the lake from the east, opposite the entrance to North Fiord. The outflow is the Waiau River, which flows south for several kilometres into Lake Manapouri. The town of Te Anau lies at the south-eastern corner of the lake, close to the outflow.

Most of the lake is within Fiordland National Park and the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage Site, the latter of which was officially recognised internationally in 1990. Other than the Te Anau township, the only human habitation close to the lake is the farming settlement of Te Anau Downs, close to the mouth of the Eglinton River. Between these two settlements the land is rolling hill country, but elsewhere the land is mountainous, especially along its western shore, where the Kepler and Murchison Mountains rise 1,400 m above the surface of the lake.

Lake Te Anau was important for the Ngāi Tahu iwi in pre-European times as the area was a traditional stopping point on their trails between the east and west coasts of the South Island of New Zealand, where they obtained food and resources. The lake was first discovered by European explorers Charles Naim and William Stephen in 1852.

Two New Zealand Great Walks start at the lake. The Milford Track starts at the northern tip of the lake and the Kepler Track starts and ends at the south tip of the lake at the Waiau River.

==Name==
The English translation of the Māori name Te Anau has been disputed. It was supposed by many that Te Anau was the name of the granddaughter of Hekeia, a chief of the Waitaha tribe, whose name now belongs to a mountain on the Longwood Range. When the Te Ana-au Caves were rediscovered in 1948, earlier explanations of the name were replaced by the interpretation of the full name Te Ana-au, Māori for &#x27;The cave of swirling water&#x27;.

==Flora and fauna==
Numerous species of wildlife and vegetation are found in the watershed of Lake Te Anau. Vegetative understory includes numerous fern species including the crown fern, &quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;.

Several species of endangered birds live around the shores of Lake Te Anau, notably the takahē (&quot;Notornis hochstetteri&quot;). An area between the Middle and South Fiords called the Murchison Mountains is a sanctuary set aside for these birds. The western shore of the lake also features the Te Ana-au Caves.

==Recreation==
Throughout summer the lake is used for boating, fishing, kayaking, swimming and access to Fiordland National Park. The lake is home to both the Marakura Yacht Club and the Te Anau Boating Club. Every year on the weekend of Labour Day a fishing competition is held.

<text>The Boeing 7J7 was an American short- to medium-range airliner proposed by American aircraft manufacturer Boeing in the 1980s. It would have carried 150 passengers and was touted as the successor to the successful Boeing 727. It was initially planned to enter service in 1992. This was intended as a highly fuel-efficient aircraft employing new technologies, but it was postponed indefinitely as the price of oil dropped during the 1980s.

==Development==

The 7J7 was the culmination of Boeing&#x27;s Seven Dash Seven (7–7) 150-seat aircraft idea, which the company had considered since at least 1981. It was to be Boeing&#x27;s second attempt at a replacement for the Boeing 727, its successful but aging 150-seat aircraft. The Boeing 757, a larger airplane that Boeing expected existing 727 customers to upgrade to, had unexpectedly slow sales leading to its 1983 entry into commercial service, as airline deregulation resulted in airlines using smaller aircraft at increased frequencies. By vacating the 727&#x27;s seating capacity, Boeing had a large capacity gap in its aircraft lineup between the larger 757 and smaller Boeing 737.

In 1983, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), an airline that employed aircraft mostly from McDonnell Douglas, contacted Boeing about the aircraft concept to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-9s. The airline would become the 7J7&#x27;s most faithful customer, and it would wield a large influence in the aircraft&#x27;s cabin design. Japan initially agreed to a Letter of Understanding with Boeing in March 1984 to take a 25-percent share in a future 150-seat airliner, such as Boeing&#x27;s Seven Dash Seven or Japan&#x27;s &quot;YXX&quot; project, that would enter service in 1988 using the IAE V2500 turbofan as the engine, which was developed in part by the Japanese Aero Engine Corporation. However, Boeing became increasingly interested in the latest propfan engine research that would yield large double-digit fuel savings, in particular with the gearless unducted fan (UDF) concept from the aviation division of General Electric. By February 1985, Boeing postponed the service entry of the then-unnamed aircraft to the early 1990s so that propfan technology would be ready for the plane; Boeing made the engine change, schedule change, and announcement unilaterally, which surprised and upset its Japanese partners. It also scrapped the 7–7 code name, saying that the moniker was too commonly seen as a possible direct competitor to the Airbus A320, and that the aircraft Boeing had in mind would be a half-generation ahead. The company held a program kickoff meeting for suppliers on May 13, 1985, and then it debuted a model of the aircraft concept at the 1985 Paris Air Show, where Boeing announced that it would start taking orders in 1987–1988 for deliveries starting in the first half of 1992. In August 1985, the code name for the aircraft was changed to the 7J7. On December 20, 1985, Boeing reached an agreement to test the proposed 578-DX geared propfan engine of General Motors subsidiary Allison Engine Company for use on the 7J7.

In March 1986, Boeing officially announced Japan&#x27;s 25 percent participation in the 7J7. The name of the aircraft reflected this participation, as the &quot;J&quot; in 7J7 represented the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation (JADC), a partnership of the large Japanese industrial firms Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). Shorts from the United Kingdom and Saab-Scania from Sweden also invested in the program a few weeks later, but with smaller, single-digit percentages. Hawker de Havilland of Australia joined with a similar small percentage in December 1986.

During the same week that Boeing made the Japanese 7J7 announcement, SAS held a 13-member board of directors meeting near Boeing headquarters to inspect Boeing&#x27;s 7J7 work. The airline also expressed its desire to eliminate middle seats in a six-abreast configuration and asked that the cabin include a seven-abreast option for economy travel. Jan Carlzon, SAS&#x27;s chairman at the time, dangled the possibility of SAS being a launch customer. He suggested that if the 7J7 were built, SAS could become the largest operator of Boeing aircraft within 10 years. In mid-1986, Ireland-based aircraft leasing firm GPA Group also declared its desire to be a 7J7 launch customer.

On August 20, 1986, the General Electric GE36 UDF engine was tested in flight for the first time, on a Boeing 727 testbed. The next month at the Farnborough Air Show, Boeing stated that the early acoustical results were better than expected. The company declared that the test levels were already at an acceptable state for quietness and noise quality, and that the production engine would reduce the noise levels a further 12–15 decibels. Boeing also announced that the company would probably build the 7J7 in two versions; the widely known 150-seat version would be joined by a smaller-capacity, 100-to-115 seat version, which might have a different fuselage size but still be powered by GE&#x27;s UDF. The miniature concept was called the 7J7-110. It would be developed by the same 7J7 team for commonality savings, and the 7J7-110 would be launched 6–12 months after the larger 7J7&#x27;s kickoff. In December 1986, however, an official from European airframe rival Airbus claimed that Boeing was offering airlines a 110-seat propfan plane and a 150-or-more seat airliner with ducted fans. The claim seemed to be verified when Boeing publicly announced its consideration of using wing-mounted engines with the International Aero Engines (IAE) SuperFan in January 1987. At the same time, the company also reversed its consideration of the smaller 7J7 model, choosing to promote a new 737 derivative instead. Boeing recommitted to the aft-mounted UDF in April, albeit one day after IAE announced that it could not complete the engine by its previous May 1992 target date. Against the protests of Allison and Pratt &amp; Whitney (which had joined Allison in its propfan effort), Boeing also rejected the 578-DX engine due to insufficient power, even though it had not yet tested the engine in flight.

Potential customers, who could afford to be choosier in an oversupplied world aircraft market, were concerned about the economics and noise of the unproven propfan engines, though. The frequent major changes in the aircraft&#x27;s design also discouraged airplane buyers from committing. Boeing neglected to survey the needs of different airlines before visiting them on a road show, so it was surprised by the unenthusiastic overall response to the 7J7 after the airframer had put so many resources into development. However, by May 1987, the 7J7 was on schedule to begin its official marketing campaign on July 1 and to start manufacturing on September 1 of that year. Boeing did attract public interest in the spring from British Airways, which was considering the 7J7 to replace its 35 Boeing 737-200 aircraft. Also, despite its chairman Robert Crandall saying 12 months earlier that fuel prices were too low to order any propfan aircraft by 1991, American Airlines announced in early August 1987 that it was investigating larger, stretched versions of the 7J7 for a possible order of 100 aircraft.

===Postponement===

Later that month, Boeing pushed back the scheduled certification of the 7J7 from 1992 to 1993, saying that the market needed time to decide whether it wanted a 140-seat or a 170-seat airplane. In justifying the decision, Boeing mentioned that SAS, British Airways, and American Airlines were the most enthusiastic prospective buyers, but the two European carriers chose a smaller plane, while American wanted the larger size. Other reports had only mentioned SAS preferring the smaller size, but favoring the bigger plane was a consensus of either US-based airlines or a core group of about a dozen airlines that had expressed the most desire in the aircraft. Boeing also expressed worry that if the 7J7 were initially designed at the larger size, the GE UDF would be able to accommodate it, but the UDF engine core might not be capable enough to power future stretches of the 7J7.

On December 16, 1987, Boeing delayed the availability date of the 7J7 indefinitely. The number of engineers devoted to the 7J7, which had already been reduced from 1,000 to 900 in October and then to 600 by December, would be reduced again to 300 in the following weeks. Although SAS publicly stated that it was still ready to order 100 7J7 aircraft in April 1988, the lack of a similar-sized domestic order led Boeing to instead concentrate its resources on further developments of the Boeing 737 and the Boeing 757. By May 25, 1988, while announcing an order for 50 Boeing 757s and 50 further options from American Airlines, Boeing said that it had begun a total rethink about the 7J7 project, dropping the 7J7 name in favor of the more generic term &quot;new medium-sized jet transport.&quot;

The 7J7 project technically continued for a long time afterward, although it never again came close to an official launch. In December 1990, the Japanese government was still urging Boeing to build the 7J7, saying that they preferred it to the 777. Two months later, Boeing confirmed that it was still meeting with its Japanese partners twice a year to discuss the 7J7, which was now framed as an eventual replacement for the 737. The aircraft had also devolved to fill a 100 to 170-seat category, a much less narrowly defined market target than before, and Boeing was no longer sure whether it should be a single-aisle or twin-aisle aircraft. Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz renewed the joint 7J7 development agreement with the Japanese firms in Hawaii, and planned to modify their memorandum of understanding. By 1994, Boeing still denied reports that Japan had ended funding of the 7J7, stating that Boeing and Japan each had five people working on the project. Although the demise of the 7J7 project disappointed their aviation industry, Japanese companies contributed significantly larger percentages of subsequent Boeing projects (about 15% of the Boeing 767 and 25% of the Boeing 777). Japanese industry is also a primary foreign partner on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Rudy Hillinga, who in 1985 tried unsuccessfully to sell the 7J7 to Lufthansa as Boeing&#x27;s head of sales in Germany, later said that he helped kill the 7J7 with Lufthansa&#x27;s support. Hillinga claimed that if Boeing had continued with the 7J7 effort, the 737 never would have accumulated 10,000 aircraft sales by the early 2010s. However, Alan Mulally, who was director of engineering for the 7J7 and would become the CEO of Ford Motor Company two decades later, stated that the 7J7 was one of the best research and development investments that Boeing ever made.

===Competition===

Competing with the 7J7 for airline interest was McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s proposed MD-91 and MD-92, two propfan-powered derivatives of the MD-80; the proposed clean-sheet aircraft MD-94X, another McDonnell Douglas aircraft powered by propfans; the Airbus A320; and Boeing&#x27;s own 737. The A320 featured a lot of similar advanced technology and electronics but was powered by conventional turbofan engines, as Airbus had rejected propfan technology in 1980, before the A320 was conceived. Both McDonnell Douglas and Airbus believed that Boeing never intended to build the 7J7. The Boeing 737 Next Generation and the 777 incorporate many of the proposed 7J7 improvements.

==Design==

(Note: This section reflects what was known about the 7J7 concept in August 1987, right before its envisioned entry date was delayed. At that moment, the aircraft was most likely to be launched and was defined to its greatest detail.)

The aircraft was planned to include advanced technology and electronics, such as:

* Fly-by-wire flight control system by GEC Marconi Avionics
* Glass cockpit by Honeywell utilizing LCDs
* Advanced integrated avionics suite
* Widespread use of high-strength composites such as carbon-fiber
* Two General Electric GE36 UDF rear-mounted advanced technology contra-rotating unducted fan (propfan) engines

The sum of all these features promised better fuel consumption by 60 percent compared to any existing large passenger aircraft technology at the time. 43 percentage points of those savings would be due to the propfan engines, 11 percentage points from aerodynamic refinements, four percentage points from structural changes, and two percentage points from systems improvements. Computer technology would reduce the amount of wires and connectors by half, saving about in wire weight from of wiring removed, and in connector weight.

Boeing planned to save in weight through the use of aluminum-lithium (Al–Li) and composites. The airframer hoped to build the 7J7&#x27;s wings out of aluminum-lithium, despite the material costing about three times more to use than conventional aluminum alloys. Claiming greater knowledge of Al–Li than its competitors, Boeing expected that aluminum-lithium alloys, which were then in their second generation of commercial availability, would save eight percent in weight compared with current aluminum alloys, or about . The aircraft could also have many parts built out of composites, including most of the structure behind the aft pressure bulkhead. In the primary structure, Boeing planned to use carbon fiber for the vertical fin, horizontal fin, beams, and stanchions. The secondary structure would contain carbon fiber in the rudder, elevator, aileron, flaps, nose gear and main landing gear doors, engine cowling, and wingtips. Combined carbon and glass fiber would be used for the fixed trailing edges of the wings and empennage, the flap track fairings, wing-to-body fairings, and engine strut fairings.

===Cabin===

The 7J7 was to have a twin-aisle (2+2+2) seating configuration, giving a wide and spacious cabin for its class, with no passenger more than one seat from an aisle. Alternatively, the aircraft could fit a high-density, seven-abreast (2+3+2) seating configuration with seats and aisles. The fuselage diameter of is wider than earlier candidates, such as a , six-abreast design (with a single aisle, although a twin-aisle configuration was considered) and a , six-abreast twin-aisle design. However, Boeing retained a backup option of a , single-aisle fuselage design, as the widebody design caused a increase in operating weight compared to a narrowbody design.

The twin-aisle setup would reduce passenger onboarding and deboarding times by ten minutes, allowing airlines to plan for 50-percent faster turnaround times compared to its competitors; Boeing&#x27;s research found that even two turned passengers around faster than one . The cabin contained modular seat elements so that seat pitch (distance between rows), seat width, and armrest width could be adjusted. It also offered an airline the ability to easily change between six-abreast and seven-abreast configurations overnight.

===Flight capability===

Boeing also provided a higher gross weight option for the plane by configuring the in-fuselage part of the wing to hold fuel. This option increased the 7J7&#x27;s range from for a standard (six-abreast) seating configuration, and from for a high-density (seven-abreast) seating configuration. Boeing&#x27;s 7J7 design had the UDF as the baseline engine with a cruise speed of Mach 0.83, according to General Electric, and the aircraft would cruise at an altitude of .

===Storage===

A volume of was available for storage. was available in the forward hold, and was available in the aft hold. It could be used for bulk storage or to hold standard LD3-46 unit load devices, a smaller size of air cargo container that was entering usage with the debut of the Airbus 320. The amount of available cabin stowage would be per passenger, an increase from the per passenger standard of at the time.

<text>Highway 10 is a minor east-west route through the southern portion of Greater Vancouver. Highway 10 is used mainly as a local access route in North Delta, Surrey and Langley, its former connector role between South Delta and Highway 1 having been taken over by the Highway 17 (South Fraser Perimeter Road).

==Route details==
Highway 10 travels for a total length of from North Delta to Langley. In the west, the highway begins at an interchange with Highway 91 as a continuation of the Ladner Trunk Road. It travels northeast before turning onto 58 Avenue as it crosses from Delta into Surrey near Watershed Park. Highway 10 then travels through residential neighborhoods in Newton and dips south to intersect King George Boulevard in a split junction near a courthouse complex.

The highway continues east on 56 Avenue through a rural zone before reaching Cloverdale, where it intersects Highway 15. Highway 10 then crosses into the City of Langley and travels around the north side of the city centre on the Langley Bypass. The bypass intersects the Fraser Highway at the Willowbrook Shopping Centre and continues east through an industrial and retail area towards the outskirts of the city. Highway 10 leaves the bypass near the Kwantlen Polytechnic University Langley campus, turning northeast to follow Glover Road into Langley Township.

Highway 10 continues northeast through a rural area of Langley Township and turns east onto Springbrook Road near the Trinity Western University campus. The highway then turns north onto 232 Street and terminates at a cloverleaf interchange with Highway 1.

==History==
Highway 10 was first commissioned in 1953, following its current alignment from Ladner east to Scott Road in Delta/Surrey, then turning north onto Scott Road. The section west of King George Highway was built over the following years by the provincial government. 

The bypass of the Langley city centre opened on July 14, 1966, and was accompanied on its first day by several collisions—seriously injuring two people and killing one person. When the bypass first opened it only went as far east as Glover Road. 

In 1967, the highway was re-aligned to continue on the Langley bypass and other roads to a junction with Highway 1 at 232nd Street.

On August 28, 1980, the non Highway 10 section of Langley Bypass between Glover Road and Fraser Highway was officially opened. 

In 2003, all sections of Highway 10 west of the Highway 91 interchange were removed from the provincial highway system; this was done to keep large trucks off the road and out of rural Delta. The municipality of Delta now maintains this segment of the old highway, now only known as Ladner Trunk Road (locally, it is still referred to as part of Highway 10).

<text>Highway 7, known for most of its length as the Lougheed Highway and Broadway, is an alternative route to Highway 1 through the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. Whereas the controlled-access Highway 1 follows the southern bank of the Fraser River, Highway 7 follows the northern bank.

Highway 7 was first commissioned in 1941, and originally went from Vancouver to Harrison Hot Springs; between Port Moody and Port Coquitlam it followed the then existing Dewdney Trunk Road. In 1953, Highway 7 between Vancouver and Coquitlam was moved to its current alignment. Its eastern end was moved south from Harrison Hot Springs to Agassiz in 1956, and then east to Ruby Creek in 1968. In September 1972, the eastern end of Highway 7 was extended to include a junction with Highway 1 just north of Hope.

The name of the highway, unlike that of Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed, is pronounced . The highway is named after Nelson Seymour Lougheed, MLA for the Dewdney District and the BC Minister of Public Works (1928–1929), who ran a logging company in the area.

==Route details==

Highway 7&#x27;s total length under the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation (MOT) is . Highway 7 is signed as far west as Granville Street on Broadway in Vancouver, all the way east through Burnaby into Coquitlam, which is under the jurisdiction of the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority (TransLink). The section under the MOT&#x27;s jurisdiction begins at the westbound exit with Highway 1 near Schoolhouse Street, with a total length of . The highway then turns immediately northeast, meets with Highway 1 at the Cape Horn Interchange, and has an exit with United Boulevard. The highway leaves the MOT&#x27;s jurisdiction after the interchange. TransLink again has jurisdiction of Highway 7 from the point east of Ottawa Street to the point east of United Boulevard.

Highway 7 falls under the MOT&#x27;s jurisdiction again after Ottawa Street, crossing over the Pitt River Bridge into Pitt Meadows. southeast of the Pitt River bridge, it crosses into Maple Ridge at Maple Meadows Way, and the highway then crosses into Mission another east. of Highway 7&#x27;s entry into Mission, it meets a junction with Highway 11. east of the Highway 11 junction, Highway 7 leaves Mission over the Hatzic Pump Bridge.

 east of the Highway&#x27;s eastern exit from Mission, Highway 7 enters the Municipality of Kent. east, it reaches a junction with Highway 9 at Agassiz. northeast of the Highway 9 junction, it leaves Kent. Another northeast, Highway 7 finally reaches its eastern terminus at a junction with Highway 1 at Haig, just across the Fraser River from the main part of Hope.

==History==
Lougheed Highway as it exists today is the direct successor to the Dewdney Trunk Road, which was completed around 1900. In fact, portions of the Trunk Road were incorporated into the Lougheed Highway.
A subsidized ferry service across the Pitt River was instigated on September 27, 1902, and was replaced in March 1915 by the first Pitt River Bridge. In the mid-1920s, the section from Harrison Mills to Agassiz over Woodside Mountain was built, being completed by the end of the 1926/27 fiscal year. This also included a bridge over the Harrison River. Around 1929, portions of the highway which followed Nicomen Slough were relocated.

From 1928 to 1931, contractors and the Public Works Department built in sections what is now the present alignment of Lougheed Highway from the Pitt River Bridge through to Mission. The route followed the already existing powerlines in Pitt Meadows, went through Haney, continued in the vicinity of the already existing River Road, and then followed the Fraser River to Mission. Ideas for a highway connecting Haney to Mission the via the path the Lougheed takes today can be traced back at least to 1919.
Around the time of the construction of today&#x27;s Lougheed through Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge, construction of what was then called the &quot;Central Arterial Highway&quot; started through Burnaby. The provincial government however, failed to complete the entire projected road and it wouldn&#x27;t be until 1946 that the effort to build the road recommenced. The missing link in the road from what is now Lakeside Drive to Blue Mountain St. and Brunette Avenue was completed by June 1948.

On August 14, 1950, the present truss bridge that carries eastbound traffic over the Coquitlam River was officially opened by Roderick Charles MacDonald.

In September 1954, the section of Lougheed through the flats south of Maillardville and around Cape Horn was opened in a two-lane configuration. Previously, the highway followed streets that now make up both Brunette and Cape Horn Avenues.

In 1957 several bridges including the first Pitt River Bridge and the bridge at Harrison Mills were replaced. W. A. C. Bennett opened the new Pitt River and Harrison River Bridges on October 21. Around that time via the Mt. Woodside section was improved significantly. Work on the Agassiz-Haig Highway was also sought over.
Around 1958, the highway was widened to four lanes from Boundary Road to North Road, entirely in Burnaby.

In the 1970s, several sections of the highway were widened from Coquitlam to Maple Ridge. In 1971 or early 1972, work to widen the highway to four lanes from Cape Horn to Pitt River Road was completed. The Agassiz-Haig section of the highway was finally opened in September 1972 after many years of construction and want. By early 1973 the segment from the Pitt River Bridge to Haney had also been widened to a four-lane standard.

From about 1953 and up until 1975, Highway 7 followed Westwood Street from today&#x27;s Orchid Street intersection, over the now-gone Scott Creek bridge and along Coquitlam/Port Coquitlam border to the intersection with Barnet Highway. This portion was replaced by the Sharpe Street Extension which completed and opened on September 5, 1975.

In 1981 work to widen the North Road to Cape Horn Interchange section was completed. Work on widening of the section of highway from Haney to Albion was being done during the early to mid-eighties.

Through the 1990s, efforts were made to widen the highway from Albion to Mission. In 1991 and 1992, the section between Highway 11 and Grant Street was widened to four lanes for $4,571,000.
In 1992 and 1993, the highway was widened to four lanes from the western boundary of Langley I.R. 5 to Whonnock for $12.7 million

In 1999, portions of Highway 7 and a former alignment were devolved to the municipalities of Burnaby, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, and Maple Ridge.

Around 2001, work to widen Lougheed highway from Brunette Avenue to Schoolhouse Street in Coquitlam to a six-lane cross section was completed. From October 2004 to about November 2005 the section from 285 Street to Mclean Street in Silverdale was widened to four lanes. In 2011, widening of the highway to four lanes from Wren street to Nelson street was completed.

From May 2018 to July 2020, work was underway to widen the portion of highway between Nelson Street and the Silverdale area in Mission. The project was completed successfully. , only one section remains to be widened to four lanes from Vancouver to Mission. This section, from 266 St. to 287 St. is, as of December 2022, under construction.

===2021 floods===
On November 14, 2021, the province experienced extreme rainfall events that led to debris flows and flooding. As a result, two mudslides occurred late that evening near Seabird Island on the Agassiz-Haig section of the highway, trapping nearly 100 vehicles between the two slides. The next day, Canadian military personnel used helicopters to safely transport over 300 people to Agassiz.

<text>Terrace is a city in the Skeena region of west central British Columbia, Canada. This regional hub lies east of the confluence of the Kitsumkalum River into the Skeena River. On BC Highway 16, junctions branch northward for the Nisga&#x27;a Highway (BC Highway 113) to the west and southward for the Stewart–Cassiar Highway (BC Highway 37) to the east. The locality is by road about southwest of Smithers and east of Prince Rupert. Transportation links are the Northwest Regional Airport Terrace-Kitimat, a passenger train, and bus services.

==History==
===First Nations and early explorers===
The Kitsumkalum and Kitselas, who have inhabited the area for about 6,000 years, traded with other villages along the Skeena. From the 1780s, European and Russian fur traders passed through. From the mid-1800s, the forestry, mining and salmon resources drew new settlers.

The Kitsumkalum First Nation own the Kitsumkaylum Indian Reserve No. 1 which is immediately west of Kitsumkalum River. The Tsimshian word for Terrace is ganeexs (meaning &quot;ladder&quot; or &quot;steps&quot;), likely a reference to the stepped terraces of the surrounding landscape.

===Steamboat era===
The first sternwheeler to attempt the Skeena was the &quot;Union&quot; in 1865, which transported supplies for the construction of the Collins Overland Telegraph line. The &quot;Mumford&quot;, which was the replacement the next year, may have reached upstream on the Skeena from the Kitsumkalum mouth (Terrace), but travel beyond the mouth may have been by canoe only.

Over the following decades, river traffic increased. Settlements and woodpile fuel stops developed along the riverbanks. In 1912, the only two sternwheelers remaining on the Skeena were the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s (HBC) &quot;Port Simpson&quot; and the chartered Foley, Welch and Stewart (FW&amp;S) &quot;Inlander&quot;, which the Skeena segment of the railway made redundant that year.

Inaugurated in 1970, the Riverboat Days festival held each summer acknowledges this steamboat heritage.

===Pioneer settlers===
In 1892, Tom Thornhill was the first European settler in the area, establishing a homestead on what became Thornhill Landing and is remembered in the naming of Thornhill and the creek. Formerly, the general area was known as Little Canyon. named such to identify as not being the big canyon. 

In 1898, George Little journeyed west from Ontario for the Klondike Gold Rush. He left the Yukon in 1905 and landed at Kitimat, from where he came north to the Skeena. That year, he pre-empted centred around the foot of present Kalum Street. Harry Frank, who had taken up the first pre-emption in the district that year, had been visiting the area since 1894. Over the following decades, the Frank Bros Dairy, immediately west of the village, became the preeminent farm.

Arriving in 1907, Edward (Ed) Eby established a settlement in the vicinity of present lower Frank St. The place was briefly called Forester before becoming Kitsumkalum. He built a small hotel and general store. The next year, the post office opened in the store. In 1912, the hotel and store at the landing closed and were demolished.

Designated a national historic site in 1996, the cemetery was established in 1909. That year, George Little began sawmilling in the area. The next year, he opened a general store and laid out the townsite on his property. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) surveyors originally intended the townsite be near Kitsumkalum, but when George offered to donate of his land for the railway right-of-way, station, and railyard, the GTP gladly accepted. In appreciation, the GTP allowed him to name the station. The earliest newspaper mention of the Littleton station name was August 1911 and of the Terrace location name was September 1911.

George Little was the inaugural postmaster 1912–1931. Since a Lyttleton post office existed in New Brunswick, the postal authorities demanded a new name. George chose Terrace to highlight the surrounding stepped landforms.

===Earlier community===
In 1913, a constable was stationed during the GTP construction. Designated a national historic site in 2006, some accounts indicate the former British Columbia Provincial Police (BCPP) building on the Lakelse Ave / Kalum Street corner was erected in 1912. However, 1913 appears more precise. That year, Knox Presbyterian Church and St. Matthews Anglican Church were also built and a co-op store established.

A Roman Catholic Church was dedicated in 1915 but was replaced by a new building at a different location in 1917. Terrace Drugs opened next to the Terrace Hotel around 1918. The next year, a branch of the Bank of Montreal arrived.

In 1921, the legion hall was built. The next year, the liquor store opened and the co-op closed. In December 1927, Terrace was incorporated as a village.

In early 1931, fire destroyed the Agar&#x27;s Garage and months later the power plant, putting the town in darkness. That year, Fred Bishop built a 100-seat theatre to show silent movies. He had been using the Oddfellows Hall since 1923. In 1933, he relocated and his theatre closed. Restored in early 1932, the electricity generating plant was again destroyed by fire late the following year. Agar&#x27;s Garage was also badly damaged at this time. A lengthy delay occurred before power was restored.

During the mid-1930s to mid-1940s, Terrace had no bank after the Bank of Montreal closed. In 1938, the government liquor store and government telegraph office were destroyed by fire. The next year, heavy snow collapsed the legion hall roof.

In 1942, a military camp was constructed which would house about 3,000 soldiers during World War II. In 1943, Charlie Adam built a theatre to entertain the troops and highway workers. In 1944, the one-week Terrace mutiny occurred at the military camp and a new co-op store opened. In 1945, fire destroyed the village power plant, and the BC Power Commission took over the electricity supply the following month.

===Post-World War II community===
In 1946, a surplus Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) appliance became the first village fire truck. That year, a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) opened. In 1949, Knox United Church burned down. 

In 1950, the rebuilt Knox United Church opened. In 1954, Charlie Adam built the then Tillicum Theatre in its present location. In 1955, the civic centre (former army mess hall) was destroyed by fire. In 1958, a new civic centre was built in George Little Park. From 1958 to the late 1970s, the Tillicum Drive-in existed. In 1959, a dial telephone system replaced switchboard operators. St. Matthews Anglican Church building was relocated within town in the late 1950s and to the Gitanyow Reserve in 1971.

In 1960, the BC Hydro electricity supply switched from a local diesel plant to transmission lines from the Kemano Generating Station. In 1964, the present municipal building opened. About this time, the Anglicans bought the Dutch Reformed building when that congregation relocated. In 1965, the Knox United Church building was moved to the present site, enlarged, and dedicated the next year. At that time, Terrace had six hotels and seven motels. In 1967, the present Terrace Public Library and Museum building opened. Bill Young, who took over the movie venues that year, added a second indoor theatre in 1974. In 1968, The Terrace Shopping Centre opened on the former LH&amp;K sawmill site.

In 1971, a blaze consumed the older section of the Terrace Hotel. Opening the next year were the new six-storey Terrace Hotel and the Terrace Arena (since renamed Terrace Sportsplex). In 1978, the Skeena Mall opened. The former Roman Catholic Church had been located in what became the parking lot.

Established in 1983, the Terrace Heritage Park Museum was designated a national historic site in 1996. Terrace incorporated as a district municipality in January 1987.

In 1993, a fire razed the 3200 block of Kalum Street destroying several historical commercial buildings.

In 1998, the co-op store closed.

===Later community===
In 2003, a time capsule was buried in Heritage Park to be opened in 2078. The next year, the Walmart store opened. In 2005, the SAAN store, present in Terrace since 1979, closed. The city bought the co-op property in 2005, and demolished the shopping centre structure in 2011 and former garden centre in 2022. 

In 2006, the Terrace &amp; District Credit Union, which was founded in 1945, merged with Northern Savings. In 2007, Phase I of the Terrace Sportsplex, which included a new ice arena, was completed.

In 2010, Terrace hosted the BC Winter Games. In 2017, fire destroyed the building which housed the original Bank of Montreal branch.

In 2023, the Métis negotiated a deal to buy the former co-op property, arranging finalization in June 2024.

==Geography==
In the vicinity, the Skeena River includes rock outcroppings, gravel and sandbars, wetlands, sloughs, and islands. Significant regular floods have eroded the riverbanks, destroyed landings, and exposed archaeological sites. Over 25,000 years ago, the river cut through glaciers to create the benches (stepped terraces) and deposited well-drained sandy loamy soils suited for agriculture.

The surrounding ecosystem is a hybrid coastal-interior rainforest, which consists primarily of western red cedar, western hemlock, amabilis fir or &quot;balsam&quot; and Sitka spruce. The Hazelton Mountains are to the east, and the Kitimat Ranges of the Coast Mountains are to the west. The north–south active fault line through the Kitsumkalum-Kitimat Valley has created many hot springs in the area.

===Climate===
Being close to the Pacific Coast, Terrace has a continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), closely bordering on an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) depending on the isotherm used. It has wet, cold winters (though much milder than inland places) and drier, warm summers, with an annual normal mean temperature of varying between average temperature in January of and in July . Average summer (June to August) temperatures are around , but temperatures over have been recorded in every month from May to September and a maximum of was recorded on 29 July 2009. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 16 December 1964. 

Terrace receives an average annual rainfall of and snowfall of , water equivalence of ; totalling of precipitation, which is enough to sustain the lush vegetation of the area. October to February are the wettest months. Predominant winds are from the west and southwest, but occasional northerners during the winter bring snow in.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Terrace had a population of 12,017 living in 4,873 of its 5,200 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 11,643. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Religion ===

=== Ethnicity ===
As of the 2021 census in the Terrace census agglomeration area, the panethnic breakdown is European (), Indigenous (), South Asian (), East Asian (), Southeast Asian (), African (), Latin American (), and Middle Eastern ().


==Education==
In 1911–12, the Kitsumkalum School opened, which also served Terrace.

In 1920–21, three classrooms were added. In 1924–25, the Kitsumkalum School rose to superior school status. In 1925–26, the Kitsumkalum Superior School rose to high school status.

In 1938–39, the high and elementary schools were renamed Terrace.

The 1946 implementation of the 1945 Cameron Report into BC school financing and administration created centralized larger districts. The establishment of School District 53 (Terrace) included the dissolving of such local school boards. Later mergers created School District 82 Coast Mountains.

In 1953, Skeena Secondary School was built. In 1955, Riverside became the elementary school name. This school had been housed in former army buildings since 1948. In 1956, Uplands Elementary opened. In January 1958, 270 pupils from Riverside moved into the new eight-classroom Cassie Hall Elementary.

In November 1963, further Riverside pupils moved into the new four-classroom Clarence Michiel Elementary. In 1967, E.T. Kenney Elementary opened. In September 1968, Caledonia Senior Secondary School opened. In 1969, Parkside Elementary opened and Riverside closed.

In 2003, a completely rebuilt Skeena Middle School (previously called Skeena Junior Secondary) opened.

In 2010, E.T. Kenney closed and the students moved to Clarence Michiel (later renamed Suwilaawks). That year, a never used and vacant for years school building opened as École Mountainview.

Operating at the secondary level are Caledonia Secondary School (grades 10–12), Parkside Secondary School (alternate), and Skeena Middle School (grades 7–9).

At the elementary level (grades K–6) are Cassie Hall Elementary School, École Mountainview (French Immersion), Suwilaawks Community School, and Uplands Elementary School.

The two private schools are Veritas School (Roman Catholic) (grades K–9) (1959) and Centennial Christian School (interdenominational) (preschool–grade 12) (1969). Spring Creek Adventist School (1951) appears to have closed in the later 2010s.

Tertiary institutions are the main campus of the Coast Mountain College (1968) and a regional campus of the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) (2000).

==Transport==
===Railway===
In late October 1910, the eastward advance of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway rail head from Prince Rupert reached the Kitsumkalum River. In early November 1910, tracklaying passed over this completed bridge at Mile 91 and through mile 100 (Vanarsdol).

In 1911, the standard-design Plan 100‐152 (Bohi&#x27;s Type E) station building was erected. The next year, when a roadmaster riding eastward on a railway motorcycle collided with an oncoming locomotive, he was fatally flung into the Skeena.

In 1927, a falling rock about one mile east of Terrace crashed through the roof of a westbound Canadian National Railway (CN) baggage car killing an employee. In 1929, an addition to the station enlarged the waiting room and the agent accommodation.

In June 1955, a Prince Rupert–Kitimat passenger shuttle began on a trial basis, which replaced the Kitimat mixed train. The line officially opened the next month, and the Kitimat station was completed later in the year.

In April 1957, the shuttle discontinued west of Terrace. In April 1958, when passenger rail was discontinued to Kitimat, a private bus operator took over the route. In 1988, Via Rail erected a stationette.

Built around 1914 and designated a national historic site in 1982, the George Little House was moved to its present location in 2004. The next year, the renovated main floor became tourism facilities and the Via Rail waiting room, replacing the stationette.

The Terrace station serves Via Rail&#x27;s Jasper–Prince Rupert train.

===Road transport===
In 1920, a Terrace–Lakelse bus service began. By the early 1920s, wagon roads extended north to Kitsumkalum Lake, south to Lakelse Lake, west to Remo, and east to Copper River. Trails existed beyond these points.

The highway grew east and west of Terrace over the following decades, the key event being the completion of the Prince Rupert–Prince George route in 1944.

By 1955, a Prince Rupert–Terrace–Smithers bus service existed. In November 1957, when Highway 25 to Kitimat officially opened, the final were unfinished. A Caterpillar D9 dragged the first vehicle over this section. In 1958, a stretch of the Stewart–Cassiar Highway was completed, which connected the Nass Valley and Terrace. That year, Western Coach Lines inaugurated a Prince Rupert–Prince George bus service, which included a scheduled stop at Terrace. The next year, the company withdrew the service.

In 1960, when Prince Coach Lines assumed the Prince Rupert–Prince George route, only was paved. In 1966, when Canadian Coachways bought the company, only was still gravel.

In 1970, Greyhound Canada purchased Canadian Coachways.

Prior to ceasing all intraprovincial services in October 2018, Greyhound had eliminated the Prince Rupert–Prince George run that June. BC Bus North immediately assumed the route.

The current passenger transit providers are BC Bus North and BC Transit.

===Ferries and road bridges===
Around 1907, the Braun&#x27;s Island bridge was built. Prior to completion of the Kitsumkalum River rail bridge in late 1910, a ferry operator used a rope to pull a rowboat ferry at the crossing. In 1911, a road bridge was constructed.

In 1912, a bridge was built to connect Ferry Road (now called Haugland Avenue) and Ferry Island, and a ferry was installed across the main channel of the Skeena. In June 1913, high water swept away the bridge. The Thornhill–Terrace cable ferry crossed the Skeena from near the mouth of Thornhill Creek to the island. The scow was a reaction ferry, but being much slower than later reaction pontoons, it required assistance by pulling on a rope when the current was weak. That October, when a worker was attempting to clear a snag on the lower cable of the ferry, he fell and drowned. The replacement bridge built the following winter was a howe truss.

In 1918–19, a pontoon reaction ferry was installed.

In 1921, the cable snapped sending the ferry downstream where the four people on board had a narrow escape. The badly damaged vessel appears to have been repaired.

In July 1925, the single-lane Old Skeena Bridge officially opened, and the ferry was discontinued.

In 1936, high water washed out four timber spans of the trestle approach on the south side of the bridge, which required the installation of a temporary catwalk.

The building of the adjacent railway bridge for the Kitimat branch in 1953 prompted a major reconstruction and renovation of the highway bridge. On realignment, many new spans and concrete piers were added, a new hardwood deck was installed, and the approaches changed.

The new (Dudley Little) Skeena River Bridge, costing $6.4 million, officially opened in October 1975. The two-lane roadway comprised a bridge over the west channel, a embankment across Ferry Island, and a bridge over the main channel.

In 2001, a grated steel deck replaced the wooden one on the Old Skeena Bridge. Up to that time, the structure had been the longest one-lane, wood-decked, curved bridge in North America. In 2005, the bridge was designated a national historic site. During 2022–2023, the bridge underwent a $22.6 million rehabilitation.

==Agriculture==
Early settlers placed limited value on timber, believing agriculture was the future. Orchards of apples, pears, plums, cherries, and berries flourished. Various vegetables thrived, while much of the timber was burned as waste.

Terrace possesses the most favourable climatic conditions for agriculture in the Prince Rupert hinterland. The location is sufficiently close to the ocean to have the summer advantages of a marine climate offering a long frost-free period and higher night-time temperatures, yet sufficiently inland to experience relatively high day-time temperatures.

By 1920, this climate advantage had created a reputation for fine strawberries, fruit, and potatoes.

==Forestry==
The forest industry drove the development of Terrace. The small Lillesberg sawmill opened in 1908, burned down in 1909, and was not rebuilt. That year, George Little established a small mill in the area, which became a substantial operation in 1911, and was described as a large lumber mill in 1915. During and following World War I, numerous small sawmills came and went.

When fire destroyed the Little&#x27;s mill in 1921, most of the lumber and logs were saved. The mill was immediately rebuilt. During the 1920s, Terrace was known as the &quot;pole capital of the world&quot;. Over 50,000 poles were manufactured annually to supply many parts of North America with telephone and electric power poles. The world&#x27;s tallest pole, long, was cut in Terrace and stands in New York City.

In 1936, Little, Haugland and Kerr (LH&amp;K) bought the George Little mill, which by 1940 was the largest employer in Terrace.

In 1943, fire completely gutted the mill. In 1948, Columbia Cellulose was granted logging rights covering near Terrace, where its woodlands division was established, creating a post-war development boom. The Sandes mill, which employed 100 workers at its peak, operated 1946–1968.

In 1952, the Pohle Lumber mill relocated to Terrace. In 1956, Joslyn Manufacturing and Supply Co bought LH&amp;K but closed the Terrace mill soon after purchase. In 1959, fire consumed the Pohle sawmill, planer mill, several boxcars, and stacks of finished lumber. The 1960 rebuild was an electrically powered modern mill.

By the mid-1960s, concerns were expressed about Terrace being totally dependant upon the lumber industry. In 1969 Columbia Cellulose purchased the Pohle Lumber mill operations.

In 1981, Canadian Cellulose was renamed BC Timber. In 1984, BC Timber was renamed Westar Timber. In 1986, Skeena Cellulose, a subsidiary of Repap Industries, bought the Westar assets. In 1988, Repap opened a new $45 million sawmill on the Pohle site in Terrace, which closed in 2001. Terrace Lumber Co ran this mill intermittently during 2005–2006.

==Healthcare==
During the railway construction, Foley, Welch and Stewart (FW&amp;S), the GTP prime contractor, established rudimentary medical facilities to treat injured workers along the route. Dr. Seymour Traynor, who arrived in 1910, had premises on Kalum Street. After GTP construction activities moved on, he remained until 1916. During World War I, the Terrace Hotel at Kalum Street and Greig Avenue was converted into a temporary hospital, where patients from the Spanish flu epidemic were treated by volunteer nurses.

After the war, several doctors practised from a small wooden medical building near the foot of Kalum Street, which Dr. Traynor built during a brief return to Terrace in 1919. The facility became a one-bed hospital with an x-ray machine in 1927. Dr. Stanley Gordon Mills, one of the first permanent doctors, arrived around 1930. His wife, Edith, a registered nurse, partnered in the medical care. During the 1936 Skeena flood, the United Church manse was converted into a temporary hospital. During World War II, a 300-bed military hospital was erected on the bench, on property now partly occupied by Terraceview Lodge.

After the war, the buildings were used for senior care and psychiatric patients but were considered too distant for a community hospital. In 1948, a 10-bed Red Cross outpost hospital opened on Haugland Ave. In 1951, the community assumed control, and the capacity soon doubled to 20 beds. In 1961, the 40-bed Terrace and District Hospital officially opened. The next year, the facility was renamed the Mills Memorial Hospital. In 1968, beds increased and an intensive care unit and a new laboratory and X-ray department were added. In 1977, a $6.3 million expansion was undertaken.

In 2021, Northern Health started building a 78-bed replacement for the current hospital at the northern end of the site. The new and larger Seven Sisters regional mental-health facility will increase from 20 beds to 25. Substantial completion and occupation was completed in 2024. However, final completion of the project will be in 2025.

In November 2024, Mills Memorial Hospital was renamed the Ksyen Regional Hospital. It officially opened its doors to patients on November 24, 2024.

==Culture and leisure==
The McColl Playhouse (former Zion Baptist Church) has housed the Terrace Little Theatre since 1953. The REM Lee Theatre and the Pacific Northwest Music Festival have hosted regional artists since 1955.

The Kermodei Tourism Society (KTS) is the co-ordinator that promotes the development and marketing of tourism opportunities in Terrace and the surrounding region. The value of heritage visitors is especially recognized, who are drawn by both indigenous cultural heritage and historic locations within the city. The outdoor lifestyle is also emphasized.

During the summer, Terrace offers many outdoor activities, such as fishing for a wide range of freshwater fish, mountain biking, hiking, kiting and hunting in the surrounding areas. In the fall, many of Terrace&#x27;s inhabitants go out to search for pine mushrooms (&quot;Tricholoma magnivelare&quot;), and pick berries. There is a variety of winter sports available in Terrace and the surrounding region including skiing and snowboarding at nearby Shames Mountain, as well as snowmobiling, ice fishing, curling, and ice skating.

In 2000, the Grand Trunk Pathway officially opened. In 2023, the western extension of the pathway was nearing completion.

In May 2024, the Grand Trunk Pathway was renamed the Xpilaxha – Charles and Emma Nelson Trail in honour of the couple’s contributions to the region.

==Media==
===Newspapers===
In 1914, plans were announced for the Terrace News Letter but its launch is unclear. During 1915–1917, the Terrace Dispatch newspaper was published.

Established in early 1920, the Terrace News existed at least until 1922. The interpretation of a 1934 mention of the Terrace News is uncertain.

By the early 1940s, the Omineca Herald at Hazelton had been renamed the Omineca Herald &amp; Terrace Times. In 1949, the name changed to the Terrace Omineca Herald and the paper moved from New Hazelton. By the early 1960s, the title was the Terrace Herald. In 1984, the paper ceased publication.

The Terrace Review published 1985–1992. In 1988, the first issue of the Terrace Standard was printed.

The Terrace Daily Online existed from about 2007 to 2012.

Joining the mainstay Terrace Standard, the Skeena Reporter was launched in 2023.

<text>Sirivennela (Telugu :సిరివెన్నల) () is a 1986 Indian Telugu-language romance film written and directed by K. Viswanath. The film stars Suhasini, Sarvadaman Banerjee and Moon Moon Sen. The film has music composed by K. V. Mahadevan.

The film won five Nandi Awards. The film was screened at the Asia Pacific Film Festival, the International Film Festival of India, the Moscow Film Festival and the AISFM Film Festival. The film was shot in Jaipur and Kerala. The film has Hariprasad Chaurasia&#x27;s flute rendering and a cameo of drummer Sivamani. The film was dubbed in Tamil as &quot;Raaga Devathai&quot;. Lyricist Seetharama Sastry derived his stage name Sirivennela from this film.

==Plot==
Hari Prasad (Sarvadaman Banerjee), a blind flutist lives along with his younger sister Samyuktha &quot;Samyu&quot;, in a village near Jaipur, which is also a tourist attraction. Though he lacks knowledge of classical music, he plays the flute melodiously. He makes a living by playing it for the tourists. One day, guide Jyothirmai (Moon Moon Sen) comes along with a bunch of tourists and listens to his flute. She understands his talent and helps him understand nature and to become a famous flautist. Years pass and Hari Prasad becomes Pandit Hari Prasad. Unknown to Jyothirmai, Hari Prasad admires her very much and dedicates all his albums to her. Meanwhile, a mute painter Subhashini (Suhasini) meets him in his village and falls for him.

Subhashini expresses her feelings through her paintings and gradually her brother understands her feelings for Hari Prasad. He approaches Hari Prasad&#x27;s uncle with a marriage proposal. But at the same time Hari Prasad reveals his admiration for Jyothirmai. This shocks Jyothirmai as she previously worked as an escort to rich tourists. She tries to hint to Hari Prasad about her not so decent past, but is overwhelmed by his pure love and his disregard for her past. Though she admires him, she feels that she would taint him with her past. She tells Hari Prasad that she cannot marry him as she already is engaged to a doctor. Hari Prasad takes it well as he always wanted Jyothirmai to be happy, and arranges her wedding.

On the wedding day, Jyothirmai commits suicide and requests in her last note that her eyes should be donated to Hari Prasad. She also requests that her funeral procession should appear like a marriage procession, and that her death should be hidden from Hari Prasad. Everyone acts like they are sending her to her in-laws. Hari Prasad keeps calm through all of this, and at last goes to the graveyard to say his final goodbye to Jyothirmai. He tells shocked Samyu that it is impossible to hide her death from him. The film ends with Hari Prasad and Subhashini mourning silently in the graveyard.

<text>The Bavarian Alps (, ) is a collective name for several mountain ranges of the Northern Limestone Alps within the German state of Bavaria.

==Geography==

The term in its wider sense refers to that part of the Eastern Alps that lies on Bavarian state territory. However, it is traditionally understood that the Bavarian Alps are only those ranges between the rivers Lech and Saalach (&quot;Altbayern&quot;). In this narrower sense, the Allgäu Alps in Swabia, which have only been part of Bavaria in more recent times, and the Berchtesgaden Alps in the east are not considered part of the Bavarian Alps.

The term is frequently used, but does not correspond to the common classification of the Eastern Alps (AVE) developed by the German, Austrian and South Tyrol Alpine Clubs. It should not be confused with the term Bavarian Prealps either. The latter only covers the Bavarian section of the Prealps between the River Loisach in the west and the River Inn in the east.

According to the Italian &quot;Partizione Delle Alpi&quot; classification, the Bavarian Alps (&quot;Alpi Bavaresi&quot;) comprise the Allgäu and Lechtal Alps as well as the adjacent Achen Lake mountains.

== Early human settlement ==
A rising number of mega charcoal pieces dated to the Bronze Age suggests increased slash and burn activities, possibly linked to the creation of open space for pasturing. These results provide evidence of human interaction with the mountain environment, beginning in the Neolithic Age and clear evidence of mountain pasture use beginning during the Iron Age at 750 BC. Based on palynology and pedoanthracology it is, however, difficult to clearly differentiate between pasturing, hunting, and other human interactions with the environment.

==Notable summits==
The Bavarian Alps in their broader sense include the following parts of the mountain ranges listed − in this tabular overview sorted according to AVE roughly from west to east and with maximum heights above sea level (NN). The highest peaks and elevations shown relate to that part of the mountain group that lies in Bavaria, and not to the overall group. For example, the highest mountain of the Allgäu Alps, the high Großer Krottenkopf, lies in Tyrol and is not shown in the table.

The highest peak in the Bavarian Alps and in Germany as a whole is the Zugspitze. It lies in the western part of the Wetterstein range and has a high Alpine character with its height of as well as its two small glaciers.

By clicking on the word &quot;List&quot; in the various rows of the Lists column, a list other mountains in the particular range may be viewed (noting that some of them will be outside Bavaria or the Bavarian Alps). The table may be sorted by clicking on the sort symbols in the column headers. 
==Landscape==
Like the Alps as a whole, the Bavarian Alps as part of the Northern Limestone Alps were heavily influenced by the last ice age. Cirques, lakes and typical U-shaped valleys were formed by the glaciers. Depositions by ice age rivers and glaciers left behind a gently rolling landscape in the Alpine Foreland with lakes and bogs.

== Animal life in the region ==
Due to hunting and environmental shifts, many animals are just now being reintroduced into the habitat they once roamed. The continent&#x27;s giant cat, the lynx, is one of those returnees. The lynx disappeared from the Bavarian Alps in the 19th century due to human persecution, along with predatory demands. A release project by Czech colleagues in the 1980s allowed for the lynx to have a second wind in the area, with the growth of the lynx population in the region. The gray wolf is the second giant predator and native to the Bavarian Forest. Like the lynx, the wolf was presumed extinct in the region, but due to conservation efforts and restraint on hunting in the area, they, too, are making a comeback.

Mammals such as wildcats, otters, or beavers inhabit the national park too. The region&#x27;s most well-known bird is the capercaillie. The stocks of the capercaillie, which is quite rare in Germany, also decreased and nearly vanished in the Bavarian Forest during the 20th century. Although the bird was close to extinction, path regulations and sanctuaries helped to further their population growth.

The persecution of native animals in the region has been a long-time concern and issue along the Bavarian Alps. Thanks to recent strides in conservation, many of these animals are being reintroduced into this habitat through park services such as the National Forest in Bavaria.

<doc id="662336" wikidata="Q5327272" url="?curid=662336" title="Earthquake insurance">
<text>Earthquake insurance is a form of property insurance that pays the policyholder in the event of an earthquake that causes damage to the property. Most ordinary homeowners insurance policies do not cover earthquake damage.

Most earthquake insurance policies feature a high deductible, which makes this type of insurance useful if the entire home is destroyed, but not useful if the home is merely damaged. Rates depend on location and the probability of an earthquake loss. Rates may be lower for homes made of wood, which withstand earthquakes better than homes made of brick.

In the past, earthquake loss was assessed using a collection of mass inventory data and was based mostly on experts&#x27; opinions. Today it is estimated using a &quot;Damage Ratio&quot; (DR), a ratio of the earthquake damage money amount to the total value of a building. Another method is the use of HAZUS, a computerized procedure for loss estimation.

As with flood insurance or insurance on damage from a hurricane or other large-scale disasters, insurance companies must be careful when assigning this type of insurance, because an earthquake strong enough to destroy one home will probably destroy dozens of homes in the same area. If one company has written insurance policies on numerous homes in a particular city, then a devastating earthquake will quickly drain all the company&#x27;s resources. Insurance companies devote much study and effort toward risk management to avoid such cases.

In the United States, insurance companies stop selling coverage for a few weeks after a sizeable earthquake has occurred. This is because damaging aftershocks can occur after the initial quake, and rarely, it may be foreshock. Although aftershocks are smaller in magnitude, they deviate from the original epicenter. If an aftershock is significantly closer to a populated area, it can cause much more damage than the initial quake. One such example is the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand which killed 185 people following a much larger and more distant quake with no fatalities at all.

==California==
After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, nearly all insurance companies completely stopped writing homeowners&#x27; insurance policies altogether in the state, because under California law (the &quot;mandatory offer law&quot;), companies offering homeowners&#x27; insurance must also offer earthquake insurance. Eventually the legislature created a &quot;mini policy&quot; that could be sold by any insurer to comply with the mandatory offer law: only earthquake loss due to structural damage need be covered, with a 15% deductible. Claims on personal property losses and &quot;loss of use&quot; are limited. The legislature also created a quasi-public (privately funded, publicly managed) agency called the CEA California Earthquake Authority. Membership in the CEA by insurers is voluntary and member companies satisfy the mandatory offer law by selling the CEA mini policy. Premiums are paid to the insurer, and then pooled in the CEA to cover claims from homeowners with a CEA policy from member insurers. The state of California specifically states that it does not back up CEA earthquake insurance, in the event that claims from a major earthquake were to drain all CEA funds, nor will it cover claims from non-CEA insurers if they were to become insolvent due to earthquake losses. 

==Canada==
There are 4,000 recorded earthquakes in Canada each year. Earthquake damage is not covered by a standard home insurance policy. In the next 50 years, there is a 30% chance of a significant earthquake in British Columbia.

==Japan==
The government of Japan created the &quot;Japanese Earthquake Reinsurance&quot; scheme in 1966, and the scheme has been revised several times since. Homeowners may buy earthquake insurance from an insurance company as an optional rider to a fire insurance policy. Insurers enrolled in the JER scheme who have to pay earthquake claims to homeowners share the risk among themselves and also the government, through the JER. The government pays a much larger proportion of the claims if a single earthquake causes aggregate damage of over about 1 trillion yen (about US$8.75 billion). The maximum payout in a single year to all JER insurance claim filers is 5.5 trillion yen (about US$39.4 billion); if claims exceed this amount, then the claims are pro-rated among all claimants.

==New Zealand==

New Zealand&#x27;s Earthquake Commission (EQC) is a Government-owned Crown entity which provides primary natural disaster insurance to the owners of residential properties in New Zealand. In addition to its insurance role, EQC also undertakes research and provides training and information on disaster recovery.

EQC was established in 1945 as the Earthquake and War Damage Commission, as part of the New Zealand Government, and was originally intended to provide coverage for earthquakes as well as war damage. Coverage was eventually extended from solely earthquake and war damage to include other natural disasters such as natural landslips, volcanic eruptions, hydrothermal activity, and tsunamis, with coverage for war damage later being removed. For residential land, storm and flood damage is covered. Cover extends over fire damage caused by any of these natural disasters.

==Turkey==
== Industry ==
Earthquake insurers use simulations to estimate the risk of an earthquake; companies which do that work include CoreLogic, which acquired earthquake modeler Eqecat in 2013 and AIR Worldwide, which is owned by the insurance analytics firm Verisk Analytics.

<doc id="662349" wikidata="Q6822353" url="?curid=662349" title="Metabolic theory of ecology">
<text>The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) is the ecological component of the more general Metabolic Scaling Theory and Kleiber&#x27;s law. It posits that the metabolic rate of organisms is the fundamental biological rate that governs most observed patterns in ecology. MTE is part of a larger set of theory known as metabolic scaling theory that attempts to provide a unified theory for the importance of metabolism in driving pattern and process in biology from the level of cells all the way to the biosphere.

MTE is based on an interpretation of the relationships between body size, body temperature, and metabolic rate across all organisms. Small-bodied organisms tend to have higher mass-specific metabolic rates than larger-bodied organisms. Furthermore, organisms that operate at warm temperatures through endothermy or by living in warm environments tend towards higher metabolic rates than organisms that operate at colder temperatures. This pattern is consistent from the unicellular level up to the level of the largest animals and plants on the planet.

In MTE, this relationship is considered to be the primary constraint that influences biological processes (via their rates and times) at all levels of organization (from individual up to ecosystem level). MTE is a macroecological theory that aims to be universal in scope and application.

== Fundamental concepts in MTE ==

=== Metabolism ===
Metabolic pathways consist of complex networks, which are responsible for the processing of both energy and material. The metabolic rate of a heterotroph is defined as the rate of respiration in which energy is obtained by oxidation of a carbon compound. The rate of photosynthesis on the other hand, indicates the metabolic rate of an autotroph. According to MTE, both body size and temperature affect the metabolic rate of an organism. Metabolic rate scales as 3/4 power of body size, and its relationship with temperature is described by the Van&#x27;t Hoff-Arrhenius equation over the range of 0 to 40 °C.

=== Stoichiometry ===
From the ecological perspective, stoichiometry is concerned with the proportion of elements in both living organisms and their environment. In order to survive and maintain metabolism, an organism must be able to obtain crucial elements and excrete waste products. As a result, the elemental composition of an organism would be different from the exterior environment. Through metabolism, body size can affect stoichiometry. For example, small organism tend to store most of their phosphorus in rRNA due to their high metabolic rate, whereas large organisms mostly invest this element inside the skeletal structure. Thus, concentration of elements to some extent can limit the rate of biological processes. Inside an ecosystem, the rate of flux and turn over of elements by inhabitants, combined with the influence of abiotic factors, determine the concentration of elements.

== Theoretical background ==

Metabolic rate scales with the mass of an organism of a given species according to Kleiber&#x27;s law where &quot;B&quot; is whole organism metabolic rate (in watts or other unit of power), &quot;M&quot; is organism mass (in kg), and &quot;B&quot;o is a mass-independent normalization constant (given in a unit of power divided by a unit of mass. In this case, watts per kilogram):

:formula_1

At increased temperatures, chemical reactions proceed faster. This relationship is described by the Boltzmann factor, where &quot;E&quot; is activation energy in electronvolts or joules, &quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature in kelvins, and &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant in eV/K or J/K:

:formula_2

While &quot;B&quot;o in the previous equation is mass-independent, it is not explicitly independent of temperature. To explain the relationship between body mass and temperature, building on earlier work showing that the effects of both body mass and temperature could be combined multiplicatively in a single equation, the two equations above can be combined to produce the primary equation of the MTE, where &quot;b&quot;o is a normalization constant that is independent of body size or temperature:

:formula_3

According to this relationship, metabolic rate is a function of an organism&#x27;s body mass and body temperature. By this equation, large organisms have higher metabolic rates (in watts) than small organisms, and organisms at high body temperatures have higher metabolic rates than those that exist at low body temperatures. However, specific metabolic rate (SMR, in watts/kg) is given by

formula_4

Hence SMR for large organisms are lower than small organisms.

== Past debate over mechanisms and the allometric exponent ==

Researchers have debated two main aspects of this theory, the pattern and the mechanism. Past debated have focused on the question whether metabolic rate scales to the power of or w, or whether either of these can even be considered a universal exponent. In addition to debates concerning the exponent, some researchers also disagree about the underlying mechanisms generating the scaling exponent. Various authors have proposed at least eight different types of mechanisms that predict an allometric scaling exponent of either or . The majority view is that while the exponent is indeed the mean observed exponent within and across taxa, there is intra- and interspecific variability in the exponent that can include shallower exponents such as. Past debates on the exact value of the exponent are settled in part because the observed variability in the metabolic scaling exponent is consistent with a &#x27;relaxed&#x27; version of metabolic scaling theory where additional selective pressures lead to a constrained set of variation around the predicted optimal exponent.

Much of past debate have focused on two particular types of mechanisms. One of these assumes energy or resource transport across the &quot;external&quot; surface area of three-dimensional organisms is the key factor driving the relationship between metabolic rate and body size. The surface area in question may be skin, lungs, intestines, or, in the case of unicellular organisms, cell membranes. In general, the surface area (SA) of a three dimensional object scales with its volume (V) as &quot;SA = cV&quot;, where c is a proportionality constant. The Dynamic Energy Budget model predicts exponents that vary between – 1, depending on the organism&#x27;s developmental stage, basic body plan and resource density. DEB is an alternative to metabolic scaling theory, developed before the MTE. DEB also provides a basis for population, community and ecosystem level processes to be studied based on energetics of the constituent organisms. In this theory, the biomass of the organism is separated into structure (what is built during growth) and reserve (a pool of polymers generated by assimilation). DEB is based on the first principles dictated by the kinetics and thermodynamics of energy and material fluxes, has a similar number of parameters per process as MTE, and the parameters have been estimated for over 3000 animal species While some of these alternative models make several testable predictions, others are less comprehensive and of these proposed models only DEB can make as many predictions with a minimal set of assumptions as metabolic scaling theory.

In contrast, the arguments for a scaling factor are based on resource transport network models, where the limiting resources are distributed via some optimized network to all resource consuming cells or organelles. These models are based on the assumption that metabolism is proportional to the rate at which an organism&#x27;s distribution networks (such as circulatory systems in animals or xylem and phloem in plants) deliver nutrients and energy to body tissues. Larger organisms are necessarily less efficient because more resource is in transport at any one time than in smaller organisms: size of the organism and length of the network imposes an inefficiency due to size. It therefore takes somewhat longer for large organisms to distribute nutrients throughout the body and thus they have a slower mass-specific metabolic rate. An organism that is twice as large cannot metabolize twice the energy—it simply has to run more slowly because more energy and resources are wasted being in transport, rather than being processed. Nonetheless, natural selection appears to have minimized this inefficiency by favoring resource transport networks that maximize rate of delivery of resources to the end points such as cells and organelles. This selection to maximize metabolic rate and energy dissipation results in the allometric exponent that tends to &quot;D&quot;/(&quot;D+1&quot;), where &quot;D&quot; is the primary dimension of the system. A three dimensional system, such as an individual, tends to scale to the 3/4 power, whereas a two dimensional network, such as a river network in a landscape, tends to scale to the 2/3 power.

Despite past debates over the value of the exponent, the implications of metabolic scaling theory and the extensions of the theory to ecology (metabolic theory of ecology) the theory might remain true regardless of its precise numerical value.

== Implications of the theory ==
The metabolic theory of ecology&#x27;s main implication is that metabolic rate, and the influence of body size and temperature on metabolic rate, provide the fundamental constraints by which ecological processes are governed. If this holds true from the level of the individual up to ecosystem level processes, then life history attributes, population dynamics, and ecosystem processes could be explained by the relationship between metabolic rate, body size, and body temperature. While different underlying mechanisms make somewhat different predictions, the following provides an example of some of the implications of the metabolism of individuals.

===Organism level===
Small animals tend to grow fast, breed early, and die young. According to MTE, these patterns in life history traits are constrained by metabolism. An organism&#x27;s metabolic rate determines its rate of food consumption, which in turn determines its rate of growth. This increased growth rate produces trade-offs that accelerate senescence. For example, metabolic processes produce free radicals as a by-product of energy production. These in turn cause damage at the cellular level, which promotes senescence and ultimately death. Selection favors organisms which best propagate given these constraints. As a result, smaller, shorter lived organisms tend to reproduce earlier in their life histories.

===Population and community level===
MTE has profound implications for the interpretation of population growth and community diversity. Classically, species are thought of as being either &quot;r&quot; selected (where populations tend to grow exponentially, and are ultimately limited by extrinsic factors) or &quot;K&quot; selected (where population size is limited by density-dependence and carrying capacity). MTE explains this diversity of reproductive strategies as a consequence of the metabolic constraints of organisms. Small organisms and organisms that exist at high body temperatures tend to be &quot;r&quot; selected, which fits with the prediction that &quot;r&quot; selection is a consequence of metabolic rate. Conversely, larger and cooler bodied animals tend to be &quot;K&quot; selected. The relationship between body size and rate of population growth has been demonstrated empirically, and in fact has been shown to scale to &quot;M&quot;−1/4 across taxonomic groups. The optimal population growth rate for a species is therefore thought to be determined by the allometric constraints outlined by the MTE, rather than strictly as a life history trait that is selected for based on environmental conditions.

Regarding density, MTE predicts carrying capacity of populations to scale as M-3/4, and to exponentially decrease with increasing temperature. The fact that larger organisms reach carrying capacity sooner than smaller one is intuitive, however, temperature can also decrease carrying capacity due to the fact that in warmer environments, higher metabolic rate of organisms demands a higher rate of supply. Empirical evidence in terrestrial plants, also suggests that density scales as -3/4 power of the body size.

Observed patterns of diversity can be similarly explained by MTE. It has long been observed that there are more small species than large species. In addition, there are more species in the tropics than at higher latitudes. Classically, the latitudinal gradient in species diversity has been explained by factors such as higher productivity or reduced seasonality. In contrast, MTE explains this pattern as being driven by the kinetic constraints imposed by temperature on metabolism. The rate of molecular evolution scales with metabolic rate, such that organisms with higher metabolic rates show a higher rate of change at the molecular level. If a higher rate of molecular evolution causes increased speciation rates, then adaptation and ultimately speciation may occur more quickly in warm environments and in small bodied species, ultimately explaining observed patterns of diversity across body size and latitude.

MTE&#x27;s ability to explain patterns of diversity remains controversial. For example, researchers analyzed patterns of diversity of New World coral snakes to see whether the geographical distribution of species fit within the predictions of MTE (i.e. more species in warmer areas). They found that the observed pattern of diversity could not be explained by temperature alone, and that other spatial factors such as primary productivity, topographic heterogeneity, and habitat factors better predicted the observed pattern. Extensions of metabolic theory to diversity that include eco-evolutionary theory show that an elaborated metabolic theory can account for differences in diversity gradients by including feedbacks between ecological interactions (size-dependent competition and predation) and evolutionary rates (speciation and extinction) 

===Ecosystem processes===
At the ecosystem level, MTE explains the relationship between temperature and production of total biomass. The average production to biomass ratio of organisms is higher in small organisms than large ones. This relationship is further regulated by temperature, and the rate of production increases with temperature. As production consistently scales with body mass, MTE provides a framework to assess the relative importance of organismal size, temperature, functional traits, soil and climate on variation in rates of production within and across ecosystems. Metabolic theory shows that variation in ecosystem production is characterized by a common scaling relationship, suggesting that global change models can incorporate the mechanisms governing this relationship to improve predictions of future ecosystem function.

<text>Medgar Evers College is a public college in New York City. It is a senior college of the City University of New York (CUNY), offering baccalaureate and associate degrees. It was established in 1970 in central Brooklyn. It is named after Medgar Evers, an African American civil rights leader assassinated on June 12, 1963.

The college is divided into four schools: the School of Business, the School of Professional and Community Development, the School of Liberal Arts and Education, and the School of Science, Health, and Technology. The college also operates several external programs and associated centers such as the Male Development and Empowerment Center, the Center for Women&#x27;s Development, the Center for Black Literature, and the DuBois Bunche Center for Public Policy.

<doc id="662351" wikidata="Q241864" url="?curid=662351" title="UEFA Euro 2008">
<text>The 2008 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2008 or simply Euro 2008, was the 13th UEFA European Championship, a quadrennial football tournament contested by the member nations of UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations). It took place in Austria and Switzerland (both hosting the tournament for the first time) from 7 to 29 June 2008.

The tournament was won by Spain, who defeated Germany 1–0 in the final. Spain were only the second nation to win all their group stage fixtures and then the European Championship itself, matching France&#x27;s achievement from 1984. Spain were also the first team since Germany in 1996 to win the tournament undefeated.

Greece were the defending champions going into the tournament, having won UEFA Euro 2004. They recorded the worst finish in Euro 2008, losing their three group fixtures and collecting the least prize money. Throughout 31 matches, the participating nations totalled 77 goals, the same as the previous tournament.

Austria and Switzerland automatically qualified as hosts; the remaining 14 teams were determined through a qualifying tournament, played between August 2006 and November 2007. As European champions, Spain earned the right to compete in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa.

==Bid process==
Austria and Switzerland jointly bid to host the games, and facing competition from six other bids: Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia, Greece–Turkey, a 4-way Nordic bid (from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Hungary, Russia and Scotland–Republic of Ireland. Austria and Hungary had previously bid together to host Euro 2004, losing out to Portugal, while Sweden had hosted Euro 1992.

Austria–Switzerland, Hungary, Greece–Turkey and the Nordic bid were recommended, in that order, before the final vote by UEFA&#x27;s National Teams Committee.

The final vote by the UEFA executive committee was:
#Austria–Switzerland
#Hungary
#Greece–Turkey
#Nordic
#Scotland–Ireland
#Russia
#Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia

The Austria–Switzerland bid became the second successful joint bid in the competition&#x27;s history, following the UEFA Euro 2000 hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands. The following tournament, held in Poland and Ukraine, became the third jointly hosted tournament.

==Summary==
Qualification for Euro 2008 started in August 2006, just over a month after the end of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The qualifying tournament was contested by national teams from each of UEFA&#x27;s member associations except Austria and Switzerland, who had automatically qualified for the final tournament as hosts, and Montenegro, who came into existence too late to be admitted to UEFA. England was the only seeded team not to qualify for the tournament proper, whereas Russia was the only unseeded one to qualify. The tournament also marked the debuts of Austria and Poland.

The draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007, and saw Group C immediately labelled as the &quot;group of death&quot;, with Italy, France, Romania and the Netherlands competing for the two qualifying places. In contrast, Germany and Portugal were deemed to have an easy draw, as the tournament structure meant they could not meet Italy, France, the Netherlands or Spain until the final.

In the group stage, Croatia, Spain and the Netherlands all qualified with maximum points. Austria and Switzerland were not expected to progress, despite the advantage of being the hosts. In Group A, the Swiss lost their captain, Alexander Frei, to injury in their first game and became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, after losing their first two matches. Switzerland managed to beat the group winner Portugal in their last game.

In Group B, Austria managed to set up a decisive final game against Germany, dubbed &quot;Austria&#x27;s final&quot;. However, they lost by one goal, making Euro 2008 the first European Championship not to have one of the host nations present in the knockout stage. In an exciting final game in Group A, an injury- and suspension-hit Turkey came back from 2–0 down to beat the Czech Republic 3–2, after an uncharacteristic handling mistake by Petr Čech, in the last few minutes, left Nihat Kahveci with the simplest of finishes.

In the same game, goalkeeper Volkan Demirel was shown a red card for pushing Czech striker Jan Koller to the ground. The Turks joined Portugal as the qualifiers from Group A. France were the high-profile victims of Group C, recording just one point from a goalless draw against Romania in their opening game. Italy beat the French, on the final day, to finish on four points and join the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Finally, in Group D, Greece failed to reproduce the form of their shock 2004 win, and ended the tournament with no points. Russia qualified at the expense of Sweden, after beating them in a final game decider, joining Spain in the knockout stage.

Torrential rain during the Group A match between Switzerland and Turkey on 11 June resulted in the pitch at St. Jakob-Park in Basel requiring to be re-laid. The new pitch was installed in advance of the quarter-final match between Portugal and Germany on 19 June. In the quarter-finals, the Portuguese team was unable to give their coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, a fitting send-off – following the mid-tournament announcement that Scolari would be leaving to join English club Chelsea – losing in an exciting game against Germany. Turkey continued their streak of last-gasp wins, equalising at the end of extra-time against Croatia and advancing on penalties. Coached by Dutchman Guus Hiddink, Russia eliminated the Netherlands with two extra-time goals. The last quarter-final match saw Spain defeat Italy on penalties, after a goalless draw in regular time.

Turkey&#x27;s progress was halted by Germany in the semi-finals. Turkey entered the game with nine of their squad members missing due to injury or suspension, but still scored the first goal. Later, they levelled the score at 2–2, before Germany scored the winning goal in the final minute. The world television feed of the match was intermittently lost during the match, which prevented the broadcast of Germany&#x27;s second goal.

This was due to a thunderstorm at the broadcasting relay station in Austria, despite the game being played in Switzerland. Swiss Television SRG SSR still had a feed, because of their own broadcasting facilities at the venue. During the lost world feed, German and Austrian television ZDF and ORF started to broadcast the feed of German-speaking Swiss channel SF 1.

This act ensured that the German goal was actually broadcast in Germany although not in Turkey. Spain won the second semi-final against Russia by three goals to nil, through second-half goals from Xavi, Daniel Güiza and David Silva, earning Spain their first appearance in a major final for 24 years.

In the final, held at Vienna&#x27;s Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Spain became European champions for the second time after Fernando Torres&#x27; first-half goal proved enough to defeat Germany. Though Germany had a strong start, Spain started to look more dangerous after they had settled.

After half an hour, Xavi played a pass in behind the Germany back line towards Torres, who outmuscled a hesitant Philipp Lahm and clipped the ball over the diving Jens Lehmann and just inside the far post. That goal proved to be the only goal of the game, which Spain dominated despite Germany having the majority of the possession, and Spain were crowned UEFA Euro 2008 champions.

==Qualification==
The draw for the qualifying round took place in Montreux, Switzerland on 27 January 2006 at 12:00 CET.

The qualifying process commenced a month after the 2006 World Cup. Austria and Switzerland automatically qualified for the tournament finals as host nations.

The qualifying format was changed compared to previous tournaments. The winners and runners-up from seven groups automatically qualified for the Championship, with the hosts filling the other two slots in the 16-team tournament. The change means there were no play-offs between teams finishing in second place in the groups – they qualified directly for the finals. Teams that finished outside the top two positions in their groups failed to qualify. Group A contained eight teams, and the others contained seven.

12 out of 16 teams who qualified for previous tournament also qualified, but the hosts, Austria, and Poland made their debuts at the European Championship. Romania and Turkey returned after missing out the 2004 tournament. For the first time since 1984, all five teams from the British Isles failed to qualify, including 2006 World Cup quarter-finalists England. Other notable absentees were 2006 World Cup quarter-finalists Ukraine, and Denmark, who failed to qualify for the first time since 1980. Bulgaria and Latvia also failed to qualify after playing in Euro 2004.

As of 2024, this is the last time England and Ukraine have failed to qualify for the European Championship.

===Qualified teams===
===Final draw===
The draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007 at the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre in Switzerland.

As was the case at the 2000 and 2004 finals, the finalists were divided into four seeding pots, based on the 2007 edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying and Euro 2008 qualifying, with each group having one team drawn from each pot. In a return to the format used at Euro 1992 and Euro 1996 the games in each group were held at just two stadia, with the seeded team playing all three matches in the same city. Switzerland and Austria, as co-hosts, were automatically assigned to positions A1 and B1, respectively. The remaining 14 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders Greece seeded alongside the Netherlands in Pot 1.

UEFA came under heavy criticism from Raymond Domenech, manager of France, who was not satisfied with his team&#x27;s position in the draw, and was also in favour of having 2006 FIFA World Cup winners Italy as top seed. On 22 November 2007, Giorgio Marchetti, UEFA&#x27;s professional football director, announced that a review of the coefficient ranking system was under way for future European Championships.

All teams from each pot, were drawn consecutively into Group A to D. From Pot 1, the remaining two teams for Group C and Group D were first drawn. All Pot 1 teams automatically occupy the first positions of their groups. Next step was to draw all teams in the order from Pot 4, Pot 3 and Pot 2; and for these teams the next group positions 2/3/4 were drawn separately from an extra glass bowl, for the purposes of determining the match schedules in each group. Coincidentally, all teams from Pots 2, 3, and 4 drew the exact same group position number as their pot number.

The draw resulted in the following groups:

==Venues==
The tournament was played at eight venues throughout the two host nations; four in Austria and four in Switzerland. Each venue had a capacity of at least 30,000 for the tournament; the largest stadium was Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna with a capacity of 53,295. It was for this reason that Ernst-Happel-Stadion hosted the final. Switzerland played all three group stage matches at St. Jakob Park in Basel, which also hosted the opening match of the tournament as a compromise for the final being held in Vienna. Austria played all of their group stage matches at Ernst-Happel-Stadion.

In 2004, the Zürich venue became a problem for the organisers. Originally, the Hardturm stadium was to be renovated and used as the city&#x27;s venue, but legal challenges delayed the plan to a point that would not have allowed the ground to be used in 2008. This created a problem, as the agreement between UEFA and the organisers stipulated that four venues would be used in each country. The problem was solved when the organisers proposed renovating Letzigrund instead; UEFA approved the revised plan in January 2005. The Letzigrund stadium hosted its first football match on 23 September 2007.

===Team base camps===
Each team had access to a &quot;team base camp&quot; for its stay between the matches. The teams trained and resided in these locations during the tournament, and travelled to games that took place away from their bases. The 16 teams validated their option with UEFA on 18 December 2007.

==Squads==
Teams were required to select a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, with the final squad to be submitted to UEFA by 28 May 2008. If a member of the final squad suffered an injury prior to his team&#x27;s first game that would keep him out of the entire tournament, another player could be called up to replace him.

==Match officials==
On 19 December 2007, UEFA announced twelve referees and twenty-four assistants were selected for the tournament. In April 2008, after failing a physical fitness test, Norwegian assistant referee Erik Ræstad was replaced by fellow countryman Jan Petter Randen. Italian referee Roberto Rosetti was selected to officiate both the opening match between Switzerland and the Czech Republic and the final between Germany and Spain.

Fourth officials
==Group stage==
The teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progressed to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.

&quot;All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).&quot;

===Tiebreakers===
For the three-game group stage of this tournament, where two or more teams in a group tied on an equal number of points, the finishing positions were determined by the following tie-breaking criteria in the following order:
# number of points obtained in the matches among the teams in question
# goal difference in the matches among the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points)
# number of goals scored in the matches among the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points)
# goal difference in all the group matches
# number of goals scored in all the group matches
# coefficient from the qualifying competitions for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2006/08 UEFA European Football Championship (points obtained divided by the number of matches played)
# fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament)
# drawing of lots

However, these criteria would not apply if two teams tied on points and goals scored played against each other in their final group match and no other team in the group finishes with the same number of points; in that case, the tie would be broken by a penalty shootout.

==Knockout stage==
The knockout stage was different from that of past tournaments. Teams in groups A and B were separated from teams in groups C and D until the final. This meant that two teams who meet in the same group would meet again in the semi-finals instead of the final if they got this far. Also, in another major change, for the first time in a European Championship, only two venues (St. Jakob-Park, Basel and Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna—the two largest of the eight stadiums used) were used for the seven matches in the knockout stage of the tournament.

As with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.

&quot;All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).&quot;

====UEFA Team of the Tournament====
The UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament. The group of nine analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Nine players from the winning Spanish team were named in the team of the tournament, while no players knocked out in the group stage were included. Four players from semi-finalists Russia were also included, the first time ever there were Russian players in the Team of the Tournament following the fall of the Soviet Union.

====UEFA Player of the Tournament====
The UEFA Technical Team also had to pick a Player of the Tournament, taking fans&#x27; votes into account. The player chosen was Spain midfielder Xavi.

* Xavi

====Golden Boot====
The Golden Boot was awarded to yet another Spaniard, David Villa, who scored four goals, three of which came in his side&#x27;s 4–1 win over Russia (the only hat-trick scored in the tournament).

* David Villa (4 goals)

===Prize money===
UEFA announced that total of €184 million has been offered to the 16 teams competing in this tournament, increasing from €129 million in the previous tournament. The distributions as below:
* Prize for participating: €7.5 million

Extra payment based on teams performances:
* Winner: €7.5 million
* Runner-up: €4.5 million
* Semi-finals: €3 million
* Quarter-finals: €2 million
* Group stage (per match):
** Win: €1 million
** Draw: €500,000

Spain, as winners of the tournament and winners of all three of their group stage matches, received a total prize of €23 million, the maximum possible prize money. Greece on the other hand, being the only team to lose all three of their group matches, were the only team to receive nothing more than the €7.5 million participation prize.

===Discipline===
At UEFA Euro 2008, players may be suspended from playing in subsequent matches upon the collection of a certain number of yellow or red cards. If a player is shown a red card – whether as a result of two bookable offences or a straight red – that player is suspended from playing in his team&#x27;s next match. If his team is eliminated from the competition before the end of his suspension, the games carry over to the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. A player is also suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated are annulled once a team is eliminated from the tournament or reaches the semi-finals.

In extreme cases of ill-discipline, UEFA may choose to have a disciplinary panel examine the incident in order to determine whether or not further suspension is required. One case of this at Euro 2008 was the suspension of Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Demirel for two matches for pushing Czech striker Jan Koller.

The following players were suspended for one or more games as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulation:

===Television coverage failure===
Three times in the second half of the semi-final between Germany and Turkey, nearly the entire global television coverage of the game was interrupted. A thunderstorm over Vienna caused technical difficulties in the International Broadcast Centre (IBC), which relayed the television feed from the match in Basel, Switzerland, resulting in one or more goals being missed by various audiences. Various national broadcasters took emergency contingency measures such as reverting to radio broadcasting (for example, the BBC used coverage from Radio 5 Live, Ireland circumvented the problem by having RTÉ Two&#x27;s studio presenter Bill O&#x27;Herlihy and panellists Eamon Dunphy, Johnny Giles and Liam Brady provide emergency discussion on what had happened in the match, and Øyvind Alsaker, commentator from Norwegian TV2 picked up his mobile and filmed it over a 3G connection). Only the Swiss public broadcaster SRG maintained full coverage since it used a direct signal other than the IBC&#x27;s.

===New trophy===
A new trophy was awarded to the winners of the Euro 2008 tournament. The new version of the Henri Delaunay Trophy, created by Asprey London, is almost an exact replica of the original designed by Arthus-Bertrand. A small figure juggling a ball on the back of the original has been removed, as has the marble plinth. The silver base of the trophy also had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plinth have now been engraved on the back of the trophy, which is made of sterling silver, weighs and is tall.

===Match ball===

The match ball for the finals was unveiled at the draw ceremony. Produced by Adidas and named the &quot;Europass&quot;, it is a 14-panel ball in the same construction as the Teamgeist, but with a modified surface design. A version named the &quot;Europass Gloria&quot; was used in the final.

There were concerns raised about the match ball, which was claimed to deviate unpredictably in flight, making it difficult to judge for goalkeepers. Notable players to criticise were Germany&#x27;s Jens Lehmann and the Czech Republic&#x27;s Petr Čech. These claims were disputed by the ball&#x27;s designer, Oliver Kahn.

===Music===
The official melody was composed by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless on behalf of UEFA. The official Euro 2008 song was &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot; by Enrique Iglesias, which was performed live during the official closing ceremony prior to the final in Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna on 29 June.

Two soundtracks, &quot;Like a Superstar&quot; and &quot;Feel the Rush,&quot; were recorded by Jamaican reggae artist Shaggy as mascot songs for Euro 2008. They formed a musical background to video clips featuring the twin mascots Trix and Flix.

The official Swiss song for the tournament was a new version of &quot;Bring en hei&quot; (&quot;Bring him Home&quot;) by Baschi. Christina Stürmer sang the official tournament song of Austrian ÖFB, &quot;Fieber&quot; (&quot;Fever&quot;). Croatia manager Slaven Bilić recorded his country&#x27;s official Euro 2008 song, &quot;Vatreno ludilo&quot; (&quot;Fiery Madness&quot;), with his rock group, Rawbau.

&quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; by The White Stripes was played when players walked out before kick-off, and a remix of &quot;Samba de Janeiro&quot; by German dance group Bellini was played after each goal scored in the competition.

===Mascots===

The two official mascots for UEFA Euro 2008, were named after a vote from the public of the two host nations from the following options:
* Zigi and Zagi
* Flitz and Bitz
* Trix and Flix

In April 2007, after receiving 36.3% of the vote, Trix and Flix were chosen. &quot;I am sure the mascots and their names will become a vital part of the understanding of the whole event,&quot; said Christian Mutschler, the tournament director for Switzerland. The mascots were unveiled on 27 September 2006, in Vienna, Austria. Their official début was on 11 October 2006, at the Austria vs. Switzerland friendly, which ended 2–1.

===Slogan===
The slogan for UEFA Euro 2008 was chosen on 24 January 2007: &quot;Expect Emotions&quot;. UEFA President Michel Platini stated, &quot;It describes in a nutshell what the UEFA Euro 2008 has to offer: all kinds of emotions – joy, disappointment, relief or high tension – right up to the final whistle.&quot;
