<text>Chettiar (also spelt as Chetti and Chetty) is a title used by many traders, weaving, agricultural and land-owning castes in South India, especially in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka.

== Etymology ==
Chettiar/Chetty is derived from the Sanskrit word (Devanagari: श्रेष्ठ) or (Devanagari: श्रेष्ठीन्), meaning superior. This term was later Prakritised as (Devanagari: सेठी), and eventually became (Devanagari: शेट) or (Devanagari: शेटी) in modern Indo-Aryan dialects.

In early Indian literature, the term referred to a wealthy class of merchants associated with the Vysya varna.

==Historical significance==

The Chettiar title has been associated with a diverse range of communities, including merchant groups, agriculturalists, and artisans. Chettiar&#x27;s are identified with the Vysya (merchant) varna due to their economic prominence and community efforts to elevate social status. The title is also used by certain subgroups of the Vellalar caste, highlighting its adaptability across regions and professions.

During the colonial era, Chettiars, particularly the Nagarathar (Nattukottai Chettiars), gained recognition as prominent bankers and financiers in South India and Southeast Asia.

== Economic and cultural contributions ==

=== Commerce and finance ===
The Nattukottai Chettiars established a sophisticated banking system, introducing financial instruments like the hundi (promissory note) and developing credit networks that extended from colonial India to Burma (Myanmar), Malaysia, and Singapore. Their financial expertise earned them a reputation as the &quot;bankers of the East&quot; during the British Raj.

=== Agriculture and textiles ===

In addition to their achievements in commerce, several Chettiar subgroups were engaged in agriculture and textile production. The Vellalar Chettiars (vellan Chettis) were historically known as agrarian landlords and also involved in trading and merchanting, while others, like the Devanga Chettiars, excelled in weaving fine textiles. The Kandangi sari, a traditional handloom product, is an enduring symbol of their craftsmanship.

=== Philanthropy and religion ===

The Chettiars are celebrated for their philanthropic endeavors. They funded schools, hospitals, and temples, many of which remain significant cultural landmarks. Prominent temples such as the Pillaiyarpatti Temple and the Kundrakudi Temple in Tamil Nadu are linked to Chettiar patronage. Their generosity extended beyond India, contributing to infrastructure and religious institutions in Southeast Asia.

<doc id="682665" wikidata="Q314593" url="?curid=682665" title="Caraga, Davao Oriental">
<text>Caraga, officially the Municipality of Caraga (; ), is a municipality in the province of Davao Oriental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 39,704 people. It is one of the oldest settlements in the island of Mindanao.

The Pusan Point located in the town of Caraga is geographically the easternmost point of the Philippines.

== History ==
The official founding of Caraga as a municipality was in October 29, 1903, under Organic Act 21, making it one of the oldest towns of the province of Davao Oriental. As early as 1591 Caraga was already listed as a mission registered under the jurisdiction of Encomienda of Bislig.

The etymology of the word “Caraga” is named after the Kalagan people (Spanish &quot;Caragan&quot;), a Mansakan subgroup (related to Visayans) native to the regions of Davao and parts of Caraga who speak the Kalagan languages. The name itself is from &quot;kalagan&quot; (literally &quot;[strong] spirited&quot;) which means &quot;fierce&quot; or &quot;brave&quot;; from &quot;kalag&quot; (&quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;) in the native animistic &quot;anito&quot; religions.

Hence, the whole &quot;Provincia de Caraga&quot; of 1622 was called &quot;region de gente animosa&quot;, that is &quot;region of spirited men&quot;. This being &quot;spirited men and women&quot; is grounded on its cultural, religious and political background. With culture, Caragans were spirited in view of their closeness to nature and attitude towards the creation. With religiosity, Caragans were spirited as to their belief on the spirits of nature (like the trees &quot;balete tree&quot;, the rivers and mountains, sun and moon); in fact, they have &quot;anito worship&quot; and &quot;ancestor worship&quot; led by the dancing priestess (&quot;balyan&quot;) and the singing priestess (&quot;catalunan&quot;). With primitive politics, Caragans were spirited as they invited a &quot;bagani system&quot; of governance.

<doc id="682672" wikidata="Q2811684" url="?curid=682672" title="Resurgam">
<text>Resurgam (Latin: &quot;I shall rise again&quot;) is an early submarine from the Victorian era and its prototype, designed and built in Britain by Reverend George Garrett. She was intended as a weapon to penetrate the chain netting placed around ship hulls to defend against attack by torpedo vessels.

==&quot;Resurgam&quot; I==
The first &quot;Resurgam&quot;, built in 1878, was a 14 ft (5 m), hand-powered, one-man vessel nicknamed &quot;the curate&#x27;s egg&quot; because of her shape. She was a one-third size prototype for Garrett&#x27;s design.

==&quot;Resurgam&quot; II==
===Construction===

The second &quot;Resurgam&quot; was built by Cochran &amp; Co. at Birkenhead and launched on 26 November 1879. Her construction was of iron plates fastened to iron frames, with the central section of the vessel clad with wood secured by iron straps. As built, she was long by in diameter, weighed , and had a crew of three. She was powered by a closed-cycle steam engine originally patented in 1872 by the American engineer Emile Lamm, which provided enough steam to turn the single propeller for up to four hours. She was designed to have positive buoyancy, and diving was controlled by a pair of hydroplanes amidships. At the time she cost £1,538.

After successful trials in the East Float at Wallasey, it was planned that &quot;Resurgam&quot; should make her way under her own power from Birkenhead to Portsmouth for a demonstration to the Royal Navy.

===Loss===
On 10 December 1879 &quot;Resurgam&quot;, crewed by Garret, Jackson (as skipper) and Price (engineer) set out for Portsmouth. However, during the voyage mechanical problems caused the crew to dock at Foryd Harbour, Rhyl, for repairs. Once completed, and after trials, the crew set sail on the night of 24 February 1880 in a high wind, towed by the steam yacht &quot;Elphin&quot;, which Garrett had bought to act as a tender. The &quot;Elphin&quot; developed engine problems and the &quot;Resurgam&#x27;s&quot; crew transferred to her to assist. Because the entry hatch on the &quot;Resurgam&quot; could not be fastened from outside, the submarine began to ship water and the tow-rope broke under the added weight, the &quot;Resurgam&quot; sinking in Liverpool Bay off Rhyl on 25 February 1880.

===Discovery of wreck===
For many years the exact location of &quot;Resurgam&quot; was a mystery. In 1995, she was found by an experienced wreck diver, Keith Hurley, while he was attempting to clear snagged fishing nets in of water. On 4 July 1996 &quot;Resurgam&quot; was designated protected wreck No. 42 under the Protection of Wrecks Act. The site of the wreck covers an area in radius at .

The &quot;Resurgam&quot;&#x27;s hull is intact although partially damaged and remains at risk from illegal diving and trawling. Since her discovery, the conning tower steering wheel has been broken and portable items have gone missing.

In 1997, a project called SUBMAP was undertaken by the Archaeological Diving Unit to study the wreck site. Over one hundred volunteer divers, coordinated by the Nautical Archaeology Society, surveyed the structure of the hull and the colonising marine life around it, using remote sensing equipment to search for debris in the surrounding area. The results of the SUBMAP project have been published as a comprehensive digital archive using Site Recorder. The wreck is currently protected against further corrosion by sacrificial anodes that had been attached to the hull. Plans to raise her have so far not been fruitful.

&quot;Resurgam&quot; was featured in the TV programme &quot;Wreck Detectives&quot; in 2004. In 2007 divers from the British Sub-Aqua Club in Trafford undertook conservation work, placing zinc sacrificial anodes on the wreck. In 2012 divers from the British Sub-Aqua Club in Chester also replaced sacrificial anodes on the wreck.

==Replica==
A replica of the vessel was built by trainees at the AMARC Training College attached to the Cammell Laird shipyard, Birkenhead, in 1996–97. She was put on display at Woodside Ferry Terminal, Birkenhead, in March 1997.

After falling into disrepair the replica was refurbished by students of the North West Maritime and Engineering College in 2009.

<text>This list of artillery catalogues types of weapons found in batteries of national armed forces&#x27; artillery units.

Some weapons used by the infantry units, known as infantry support weapons, are often misidentified as artillery weapons because of their use and performance characteristics, sometimes known colloquially as the &quot;infantryman&#x27;s artillery&quot; which has been particularly applied to mortars.

The distinguishing feature of infantry support weapons from artillery weapons is in the unit that provides the personnel for the weapon crew.

This list does not differentiate between guns and cannons, although some designations use one word or the other. The word &quot;cannon&quot; is of Latin origin, borrowed into the English language from the French, while &quot;gun&quot; appears to be of German language origin and is found in earlier use in England. There is almost universal use of in the English language to refer to artillery personnel, and not the French term &quot;cannonier&quot;. Some English speaking armies do use the originally French term bombardier as a rank in artillery units.

== Recoilless guns ==
=== Recoilless guns ===
A recoilless gun or recoilless rifle (RCL) is a lightweight weapon that fires a heavier projectile than would be practical to fire from a recoiling weapon of comparable size. Technically, only devices that use a rifled barrel are recoilless rifles. Smoothbore variants are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles.

Normally used for anti-tank roles, the first effective system of this kind was developed during World War II to provide infantry with light, cheap and easily deployable weapon that does not require extensive training in gunnery. The near complete lack of recoil allows some versions to be shoulder-fired, but the majority are mounted on light tripods and are intended to be easily carried by a soldier.

=== Self-propelled recoilless guns ===
Self-propelled recoilless guns are vehicles designed to carry recoilless guns. 
Only a few such designs have been successful, many mounting multiple rifles.

== Anti-aircraft guns ==
=== Towed and static anti-aircraft guns ===
=== Self-propelled anti-aircraft guns ===
Anti-aircraft guns are weapons designed to attack aircraft. Such weapons commonly have a high rate of fire and are able to fire shells designed to damage aircraft. They also are capable of firing at high angles, but are also usually able to hit ground targets as well in a direct-fire role.

== Anti-tank guns ==
=== Towed anti-tank guns ===
=== Self-propelled anti-tank guns ===
Anti-tank guns are typically high-velocity guns designed to fire anti-tank shells. They are usually designed to be easily transported and concealed to maximize responsiveness and surprise.

== Assault guns ==

Assault guns are guns mounted in armored vehicles designed to provide direct fire support for infantry and armored forces. Typically, the gun is mounted in the hull and the front of the vehicle most heavily armored.

== Autocannons ==

Autocannons are like machine guns but their calibers are at least 20mm.

== Vehicle guns ==
=== Aircraft artillery ===

Aircraft artillery has been used since the first world war.

=== Tank guns ===

Tank guns are high-velocity guns designed to be fitted into the turret of a tank. They share many design features with anti-tank guns and in many cases are directly related to anti-tank gun designs. The primary objective of most tank guns is to be able to destroy other tanks, but other tasks such as fire support and anti-personnel missions often are required.

=== Naval artillery ===

Naval guns are manufactured based on the same principles as the land based artillery ordnance, but differ significantly in system design and use. Never referred to as &quot;artillery&quot; it is however often called upon to provide naval artillery fire support to the land forces operation in the coastal region within their range.

=== Railway artillery ===

Railway artillery involved large guns and howitzers mounted and transported on specially-constructed railway cars.

== Mortars ==

=== Mortar carriers ===

=== Infantry mortars ===

The List of infantry mortars catalogues weapons which are issued to infantry units to provide close range, rapid response, indirect fire capability of an infantry unit in tactical combat. In this sense the mortar has been called &quot;infantryman&#x27;s artillery&quot;, and represents a flexible logistic solution to satisfying unexpected need for delivery of firepower, particularly for the light infantry. In general infantry mortars are defined by what a team of infantrymen, sometimes known as mortarmen, can transport unaided by significant vehicle support. Because of this intrinsic restriction mandated by weight, mortars are only considered &quot;infantry&quot; to a caliber of 120mm. These larger weapons usually require wheeled assemblies to allow their towing either by hand or by light tactical vehicles.

=== Heavy mortars ===

Heavy mortars are large-caliber mortars designed to fire a relatively heavy shell on a high angle trajectory. Such weapons have a relatively short range, but are usually less complex than similar caliber field artillery.

This category includes the &quot;Trench Mortars&quot; of World War I which were all too heavy and cumbersome, and hence lacked the mobility, to be classed as infantry mortars.

== Field artillery ==
=== Muzzle-loading guns ===
=== Infantry guns ===
=== Self-propelled infantry guns ===

Infantry guns are designed to provide direct organic support for infantry forces. They fire a range of shells, primarily in a direct-fire mode. Most are lightweight and capable of being manhandled for limited mobility to accompany infantry.

=== Mountain artillery ===

Mountain artillery, which includes pack howitzers, mountain howitzers and mountain guns, is designed to accompany mountain infantry forces. Usually lightweight and designed to be broken down to be portable by pack animals or even soldiers, they often are in limited calibers with low muzzle energy. Correspondingly, range and anti-armor capabilities are limited. However, they can deliver useful firepower in locations that may be inaccessible to heavier support forces.

=== Field guns ===
=== Self-propelled field guns ===
Field guns are one of two primary types of field artillery. Guns fire a heavy shell on a relatively level trajectory from a longer barrel, allowing for very high muzzle velocity and good range performance. Guns are most adequate for providing long range fire support and counter-battery fire.

=== Howitzers ===
=== Self-propelled howitzers ===
Howitzers are one of two primary types of field artillery. Howitzers fire a heavy shell in a high trajectory from a relatively short barrel. Range is limited but howitzers are slightly more mobile than similarly sized field guns.

==== Wheeled self-propelled howitzer ====
It is a sub-category of self-propelled howitzers, where the artillery gun is mounted on a wheeled vehicle, usually a 8×8 or 10×10 APC, or 6×6, 8×8, 10×10 trucks.

==== Tracked self-propelled howitzer ====
It is a sub-category of self-propelled howitzers, where the artillery gun is mounted on a tracked vehicle.

=== Siege artillery ===

Siege artillery are heavy guns and other bombardment devices designed to bombard fortifications, cities, and other fixed targets. They are capable of firing heavy shells but require enormous transport and logistical support to operate. They lack mobility and thus are rarely useful in more mobile warfare situations.

<doc id="682679" wikidata="Q696640" url="?curid=682679" title="Duchy of Pomerania">
<text>The Duchy of Pomerania (; ; Latin: &quot;Ducatus Pomeraniae&quot;) was a duchy in Pomerania on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, ruled by dukes of the House of Pomerania (&quot;Griffins&quot;). The country existed in the Middle Ages between years 1121–1160, 1264–1295, 1478–1531, and 1625–1637.

The duchy originated from the realm of Wartislaw I, a Slavic Pomeranian duke, and was extended by the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp in 1317, the Principality of Rügen in 1325, and the Lauenburg and Bütow Land in 1455. During the High Middle Ages, it also comprised the northern Neumark and Uckermark areas as well as Circipania and Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

The Duchy of Pomerania was established as a vassal state of Poland in 1121, which it remained until the fragmentation of Poland after the death of Polish ruler Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1138. Afterwards the Dukes of Pomerania were independent, and later were vassals of the Duchy of Saxony from 1164 to 1181, of the Holy Roman Empire from 1181 to 1185, of Denmark from 1185 to 1227 and finally, from 1227 on, staying with the Holy Roman Empire (including periods of vassalage to the Margraves of Brandenburg).

Most of the time, the duchy was ruled by several Griffin dukes in common, resulting in various internal partitions. After the last Griffin duke had died during the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1637, the duchy was partitioned between Brandenburg-Prussia and Sweden. The Kings of Sweden and the Margraves of Brandenburg, later Kings of Prussia, became members as Dukes of Pomerania in the List of Reichstag participants.

==History==
In the 12th century, Poland, the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s Duchy of Saxony and Denmark variously conquered Pomerania, ending the tribal era.

===House of Pomerania (Griffins)===


The Stolp (Słupsk) and Schlawe (Sławno) areas (&quot;lands of (Länder) Schlawe-Stolp&quot;) were ruled by Ratibor I and his descendants (&quot;Ratiboriden&quot; branch of the Griffin House of Pomerania) until the Danish occupation and extinction of the Ratiboride branch in 1227.

The areas stretching from Kolberg (Kołobrzeg) to Stettin (Szczecin) were ruled by Ratibor&#x27;s brother Wartislaw I and his descendants (House of Pomerania, also called Griffins, of which he was the first ascertained ancestor) until the 1630s. The terms of surrender after the Polish conquest were that Wartislaw had to accept Polish sovereignty, convert his people to Christianity, and pay an annual tribute to the Polish duke.

===Poland===
In several expeditions mounted between 1102 and 1121, most of Pomerania had been conquered by the Polish duke Bolesław III Wrymouth.

From 1102 to 1109, Boleslaw campaigned in the Noteć and Parsęta area. The Pomeranian residence in Białogard was taken already in 1102. From 1112 to 1116, Boleslaw subdued all of Pomerelia. From 1119 to 1122, the area towards the Oder were subdued. Szczecin was taken in the winter of 1121–1122.

The conquest resulted in a high death toll and devastation of vast areas of Pomerania, and the Pomeranian dukes were forced to become vassals of Boleslaw III, King of Poland.

Poland&#x27;s influence vanished in the next decade. In 1135, Bolesław had accepted overlordship of Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III and in turn received his Pomeranian gains as well as the still undefeated Principality of Rügen as a fief. Wartislaw I also accepted the Emperor as his overlord. With Bolesław&#x27;s death in 1138 and the fragmentation of Poland, Polish overlordship ended, triggering competition of the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark for the area.

===Westward expansion of Wartislaw I===
In the meantime, Wartislaw managed to conquer vast territories west of the Oder river, an area inhabited by Lutici tribes weakened by past warfare, and included these territories into his &quot;Duchy of Pomerania&quot;. Already in 1120, he had expanded west into the areas near the Oder Lagoon and Peene river. Most notably Demmin, the Principality of Gützkow and Wolgast were conquered in the following years.

The major stage of the westward expansion into Lutici territory occurred between Otto of Bamberg&#x27;s two missions, 1124 and 1128. In 1128, Demmin, the County of Gützkow and Wolgast were already incorporated into Wartislaw I&#x27;s realm, yet warfare was still going on. Captured Lutici and other war loot, including livestock, money, and clothes were apportioned among the victorious. After Wartislaw&#x27;s Lutician conquests, his duchy lay between the Bay of Greifswald to the north, Circipania, including Güstrow (Ostrów), to the west, Kolobrzeg in the east, and possibly as far as the Havel and Spree rivers in the south.

These gains were not subject to Polish over lordship, but were placed under over lordship of Nordmark margrave Albrecht the Bear a dedicated enemy of Slavs, by Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor. Thus, the western territories contributed to making Wartislaw significantly independent from the Polish dukes. Wartislaw was not the only one campaigning in these areas. The Polish Duke Boleslaw III, during his Pomeranian campaign launched an expedition into the Müritz area in 1120–21, before he turned back to subdue Wartislaw. The later Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III (then Saxon duke Lothair I of Supplinburg) in 1114 initiated massive campaigns against the local Lutici tribes resulting in their final defeat in 1228. Also, the territories were invaded by Danish forces multiple times, who, coming from the Baltic Sea, used the rivers Peene and Uecker to advance to a line Demmin–Pasewalk. At different times, Pomeranians, Saxons and Danes were either allies or opponents. The Pomeranian dukes consolidated their power in the course of the 12th century, yet the preceding warfare had left these territories completely devastated.

===Conversion and the Pomeranian diocese===

A first attempt to convert the Pomeranians was made following the subjugation of Pomerania by Boleslaw III of Poland. In 1122, Spanish monk Bernard (also Bernhard) travelled to Jumne (Wolin), accompanied only by his chaplain and an interpreter. The Pomeranians however were not impressed by his missionary efforts and finally threw him out of town.

Bernard was later made the first bishop of Lubusz in Poland.

After Bernard&#x27;s misfortune, Boleslaw III asked Otto of Bamberg to convert Pomerania to Christianity, which he accomplished in his first visit in 1124–25. Otto&#x27;s strategy severely differed from the one Bernard used: While Bernard travelled alone and as a poor and unknown priest, Otto, a wealthy and famous man, was accompanied by 20 clergy of his own diocese, numerous servants, 60 warriors supplied to him by Boleslaw, and carried with him numerous supplies and gifts. After arriving in Pyritz, the Pomeranians were assured that Otto&#x27;s aim was not the gain of wealth at the expense of the Pomeranian people, as he was wealthy already, but only to convert them to Christianity, which would protect the Pomeranians from further punishment by God, as which the devastating Polish conquest was depicted. This approach turned out to be successful, and was backed by parts of the Pomeranian nobility that in part was Christian raised already, like duke Wartislaw I, who encouraged and promoted Otto&#x27;s mission. Many Pomeranians were baptized already in Pyritz and also in the other burghs visited.

Otto of Bamberg returned in 1128, this time invited by duke Wartislaw I himself, aided by the emperor Holy Roman Emperor Lothar II, to convert the (Lutician) Slavs of Western Pomerania just incorporated into the Pomeranian duchy, and to strengthen the Christian faith of the inhabitants of Stettin and Wollin, who fell back into heathen practices and idolatry. Otto this time visited primarily Western Pomeranian burghs, had the temples of Gützkow and Wolgast torn down and on their sites erected the predecessors of today&#x27;s &quot;St Nikolai&quot; and &quot;St Petri&quot; churches, respectively. The nobility assembled to a congress in Usedom, where they accepted Christianity on 10 June 1128. Otto then was titled &quot;apostolus gentis Pomeranorum&quot;, made a saint by pope Clement III in 1189, and was worshipped in Pomerania even after the Protestant Reformation.

In 1140, one year after Otto of Bamberg&#x27;s death, a Pomeranian diocese was founded and placed directly under the Holy See. Adalbert of Pomerania, who had participated in Otto&#x27;s mission as an interpreter and assistant, was made the first bishop. The direct subordination under the pope thwarted the claims of the archbishops of Magdeburg and Gniezno, who both had asserted pressure on Otto of Bamberg to incorporate the new diocese into their realms. The initial see of the Pomeranian diocese was Wollin, and was moved to Grobe Abbey on the island of Usedom and to Kammin (Cammin, now Kamien Pomorski) after 1150 and 1175, respectively. Since 1188, when the pope accepted the move of the see, the bishopric was referred to as Roman Catholic Diocese of Kammin, while before it was addressed as Pomeranian diocese.

In 1248, the Kammin bishops and the Pomeranian dukes had interchanged the &quot;terrae&quot; Stargard and Kolberg, leaving the bishops in charge of the latter. In the following, the bishops extended their secular reign, which soon comprised the Kolberg (now Kołobrzeg), Köslin (also Cöslin, now Koszalin) and Bublitz (now Bobolice) areas. When in 1276 they became the sovereign of the town of Kolberg also, they moved their residence there, while the administration of the diocese was done from nearby Köslin. The bishops at multiple occasions tried to exclude their secular reign from ducal overlordship by applying for Imperial immediacy (&quot;Reichsunmittelbarkeit&quot;). The Pomeranian dukes successfully forestalled these ambitions, and immediacy was granted only temporarily in 1345.

===Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire===

In the West, bishops and dukes of the Holy Roman Empire mounted expeditions to Pomerania. Most notable for the further fate of Pomerania are the 1147 Wendish Crusade and the 1164 Battle of Verchen, the Pomeranian dukes became vassals of Henry the Lion, of Saxony. Despite this vassalage, Henry again sieged Demmin in 1177 when he allied with the Danes, but reconciled with the Pomeranian dukes thereafter. In 1181 the dukes took their duchy as a fief from the Holy Roman Emperor Barbarossa. Bogislaw I, Duke of Pomerania had travelled to Barbarossa&#x27;s camp in Lübeck, where he received the Imperial flag and the title &quot;Duke of Slavinia&quot;.

From the North, Denmark attacked Pomerania. Several campaigns throughout the 12th century (in 1136, 1150, 1159 and throughout the 1160s) culminated in the defeat of the Principality of Rugia in 1168. The Rugian princes became vassals of Valdemar I of Denmark. In the fall of 1170, the Danes raided the Oder estuary. In 1171, the Danes raided Circipania and took Cotimar&#x27;s burgh in Behren-Lübchin. In 1173, the Danes turned to the Oder Lagoon again, taking the burgh of Stettin. Wartislaw II Swantiboriz, castellan of Stettin, became a Danish vassal. In 1177, the Danes again raided the Oder Lagoon area, also the burgh of Wolgast in 1178. In 1184 and 1185, three campaigns of the Danes resulted in making Bogislaw I, Duke of Pomerania a Danish vassal. These campaigns were mounted by Valdemar&#x27;s son and successor for the Danish throne, Canute VI of Denmark. In the Duchy of Pomerania the Danish period lasted until Valdemar II of Denmark lost the Battle of Bornhöved on 22 July 1227. Danish supremacy prevailed until 1325 in the Rugian principality.

At that time, the duchy was also referred to as Slavinia (), a term also applied to several Wendish areas such as Mecklenburg and the Principality of Rügen.

==German settlement (Ostsiedlung)==

Starting in the 12th century, Pomerania was settled with Germans in a process termed Ostsiedlung, that affected all medieval East Central and Eastern Europe. Except for the Pomerelian Kashubians and the Slovincians, the Wends were assimilated. Most towns and villages date back to this period.

===Rural settlement===

Before the Ostsiedlung, Pomerania was rather sparsely settled. Around 1200, a relatively dense population could be found on the islands of Rügen, Usedom and Wollin, around the burghs of Stettin, Köslin, Pyritz (&quot;Pyritzer Weizacker&quot;) and Stargard, around the Persante river (Kolberg area), the lower Peene river, and between Schlawe and the Leba valley. Largely unsettled were the hilly regions and the woods in the South. The 12th century warfare, especially the Danish raids, depopulated many areas of Pomerania and caused severe population drops in others (e.g. Usedom). At the turn to the 13th century, only isolated German settlements existed, e.g. Hohenkrug and other German villages, and the merchant&#x27;s settlement near the Stettin burgh. In contrast, the monasteries were almost exclusively run by Germans and Danes.

Massive German settlement started in the first half of the 13th century. Ostsiedlung was a common process at this time in all Central Europe and was largely run by the nobles and monasteries to increase their income. Also, the settlers were expected to finish and secure the conversion of the non-nobles to Christianity. In addition, the Danes withdrew from most of Pomerania in 1227, leaving the duchy vulnerable to their expansive neighbors, especially Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, and Henry I of Silesia.

Germans, at this early stage (before 1240), were often settled in frontier regions, such as the mainland part of the Principality of Rugia (after prince Jaromar I granted Eldena Abbey the right to call in settlers in 1209), Circipania, the lands of Loitz (administered semi-independently by Detlev of Gadebush), the Uckermark, the lands of Kolbatz Abbey and Bahn (which later was granted to the Knights Templar), and the area north of the Warthe and along the lower Oder river. However, in many of these frontiers, German settlement did not hinder the advance of Pomerania&#x27;s neighbors.

Germans were placed under a different law than Slavs. While those were unfree (except for the nobles), did not own the soil they cultivated, and were to serve the nobility, the opposite was true for the Germans.

About 1240, the areas of Stavenhagen and Pyritz were subject to German settlement. About 1250, massive settlement took place also in Central Western Pomerania (County of Gützkow, lands of Meseritz, Ploth, Ziethen and Groswin), and the Stargard area (where settlement was encouraged already since 1229). In the 1260s, settlement started in the Cammin area, and in the virtually unpopulated lands of Naugard, Massow and Daber. The Ueckermünde and the Oder mouth areas were also settled at about 1260, but the Ueckermünde heath and the woodlands on both sides of the Oder Lagoon remained untouched. In the areas adjacent to the Peenestrom (the lands of Wusterhusen and Lassan) local Slavs participated in the German settlement, which started in the 1260s. Settlement of the areas centered on the upper Rega river, previously unsettled, started in the 1250s, and reached a peak in the 1280s. The lower Rega area around Greifenberg and Treptow an der Rega was settled about the same period, but here a native Slavic population participated. In the Persante area, first German settlements occurred about 1260, but a more extensive settlement did not start before 1280. On the islands of Usedom and Wollin, only isolated settlements took place in the 13th century, e.g. in the Garz (Usedom) and Caseburg (Karsibór) area, where Germans settled already in the 1240s, and in proximity of the German town of Wolin. The local Grobe Abbey did, in contrast to the other Pomeranian monasteries, not enhance German settlement. Therefore, Slavic culture on the isles persisted and vanished only in the late 14th century. The island of Rügen, in contrast to the meanwhile German mainland parts of the principality, also remained a Slavic character throughout the 13th century – German settlement would only start in the 14th century, with strong participation of local Slavs. In Schlawe-Stolp, German settlement started in the 1260s, and was promoted by the Belbuck Abbey. A large influx of settlers to the western parts of Schlawe-Stolp took place after 1270, first settlers were called to the Stolp area in the 1280s. Here, local Slavs participated in the Ostsiedlung, and settlement went on throughout the 14th century.

Initially, the Germans who settled the northern regions predominantly came from Lower Saxony, while the Germans who settled the southern areas (&quot;mittelpommerscher Keil&quot;) predominantly came from Altmark and Westphalia. This caused the emergence of East Pomeranian, 
Central Pomeranian and Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch dialects. German settlers also came from areas earlier affected from Ostsiedlung, such as Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, and later also German settled regions of Pomerania herself. Though the exact proportion of German versus Slavic populations cannot be determined, it is undisputed that the Germans significantly outnumbered the Slavs. Before the end of the 13th century, the Western Pomeranian mainland and most of Farther Pomerania west of the Gollenberg had turned almost completely German, mentions of Slavs in documents became exceptional. The Slavic dialects disappeared, with the exception that fishermen from the isles and the Oder lagoon area continued to use Wendish for a relatively long period.

Villages before the Ostsiedlung were of the &quot;Haufendorf&quot; type, the houses were built in close proximity to each other without a special ruling. A variant of this type also found in Pomerania is the Sackgassendorf (or Sackdorf) type, where a dead end road leads to those houses. This type evolved as an extension of &quot;Haufendorf&quot; type villages. German settlement introduced new types of villages: In the Hagenhufendorf type, houses were built on both sides of a main road, each within their own hide (). Those villages were usually set up after the clearance of woodlands, most of them were given German names in absence of any Slavic site names. This type of village can be found all along the coast, most of them in the areas between Barth and Wolgast, Kolberg and Köslin, and north and west of Schlawe. Other villages were built in the Angerdorf type, where a main street fork encloses a large meadow (&quot;Anger&quot;) in the village&#x27;s center where the life stock was kept at night, sometimes the church or other buildings not used for living were built on the Anger also. This type is the most prominent type in the Peene, lower Oder, Pyritz, Lake Madü and Rega areas, many villages of this type are also found in the Kolberg and Schlawe area. In addition to these types, the Straßendorf type, characterized by a single and very long main street, was introduced in a later stage of Ostsiedlung, and therefore is found predominantly in areas that were affected last by the German settlement (easternmost parts, Cammin area). Villages of this type were either new foundations, or extensions of Slavic precursors. In other areas, Hagenhufendorf and Angerdorf types dominate, while the &quot;Haufendorf&quot; type used in Slavic times and its Sackdorf variant can still be found in between, predominantly on the islands.

The villages&#x27; area was divided in hides. The size of a hide differed between the village types: A Hagenhufe, used in the Hagenhufendorf villages, comprised 60 Morgen (), about 40 hectares. A Landhufe, used in the Angerdorf villages, comprised 30 Morgen. One farm would usually have an area of one Hagenhufe or two Landhufen. Slavic farmland was measured in Haken (), with one Haken equals 15 Morgen (half a Landhufe). Haken were used only in villages remaining under old Slavic law (predominantly on the islands), whereas Hufen were used for new villages placed under German law (in Pomerania sometimes referred to as Schwerin Law). Not all families of German villages owned a Hufe. Those dwelling on considerably smaller property (&quot;gardens&quot;) were usually hired as workers by the farmers (). These people were termed &quot;gardeners&quot; () or Kossäten (literally &quot;who sits in a hut&quot;), and could either be local Slavs or the younger sons of German farmers who did not inherit their father&#x27;s soil.

===Foundation of towns===

Nearly all towns in modern Pomerania date back to the Ostsiedlung. In Slavic times, there have been town-like settlements already in Demmin, Wolgast, Usedom, Wollin, Stettin, Kolberg, Pyritz and Stargard, although many of the coastal settlements declined during the 12th century warfare. Yet these settlements were not continued by the German towns, which were founded on previously unsettled soil. Although some towns had a Slavic settlement, sometimes attached to a burgh, as precursor, the name of which would be adopted for the German town, the new town was usually founded on empty space in the settlements neighborhood. The distance could be some kilometers as in the case of Kolberg. Exceptions are Wollin and probably Cammin, which were built on the spot of former, yet decayed settlements, and Stettin, where two German settlements were set up close to the Slavic burgh and settlement, all of which were included in the later town. In many cases, the name of the neighboring Slavic settlement would be used for the new town.

The towns were built on behalf of the Pomeranian dukes or ecclesial bodies like monasteries and orders. Most prominent on this issue was Barnim I of Pomerania-Stettin, who since was entitled &quot;the towns&#x27; founder&quot;. The towns build on his behalf were granted Magdeburg Law and settled predominantly by people from the western Margraviate of Brandenburg, while the towns founded in the North (most on behalf of the Rugian princes and Wartislaw III of Pomerania-Demmin were granted Lübeck Law and were settled predominantly by people from Lower Saxony. The first towns were Stralsund (Principality of Rügen, 1234), Prenzlau (Uckermark, then Pomerania-Stettin, 1234), Bahn (Knights Templar, about 1234), and Stettin (1237–43), Gartz (Oder) (Pomerania-Stettin, 1240), and Loitz (by Detlev of Gadebusch, 1242). Other towns built in the 1240s were Demmin, Greifswald (by Eldena Abbey), Altentreptow.

In the 1250s followed Anklam, Altdamm, Pyritz, probably already Stargard and Grimmen, Greifenhagen, Barth (Principality of Rügen, before 1255), and Damgarten (Principality of Rügen, 1258). In the 1260s followed Wollin (1260), Ueckermünde, Wolgast, probably already Gützkow, Pölitz (1260), Greifenberg (1262), Gollnow, probably already Usedom, Penkun, Tribsees (Principality of Rügen, before 1267) and Naugard (by the bishop of Cammin, before 1268). In the 1270s followed Cammin (1274), Massow (by the bishop of Cammin, 1274), Pasewalk (recorded in 1274, founded probably in the 1250s), Plathe (1277), Lassan (between 1264 and 1278), Rügenwalde (by Wizlaw II of Rügen), Regenwalde (1279–80), Labes (about 1280), and Treptow an der Rega (between 1277 and 1281). Neuwarp, Richtenberg, Belgard, and Werben (by the bishop of Cammin) are first recorded in 1295, 1297, 1299, and 1300, respectively, all were most certainly founded earlier.

In the area directly administered by the bishops of Cammin, the towns of Kolberg (1255), Köslin (1266), Körlin (early 14th century), and Bublitz (1340) were set up. The early 14th century saw the foundation of Stolp (by Waldemar of Brandenburg, 1310), Neustettin (by Wartislaw IV, 1310), Rügenwalde (again 1312, the 1270s precursor had not done well), Rugendal (Principality of Rügen, before 1313, decayed), Schlawe (by the Swenzones, 1317), Garz (by the princes of Rügen, 1320s), Jacobshagen (by three brothers &quot;von Stegelitz&quot;, 1336), Freienwalde (by &quot;von Wedel&quot;, before 1338), Zanow (by the Swenzones, 1343), Lauenburg (by the Teutonic Knights, 1341), Bütow (by the Teutonic Knights, 1346), and Fiddichow (by Barnim III, 1347).

Many towns with a burgh in close proximity had the duke level this burgh when they grew in power. Stettin, where the burgh was inside the town, had the duke level his burgh already in 1249, other towns were to follow. The fortified new towns had succeeded the burghs as strongholds for the country&#x27;s defense. In many cases, the former burgh settlement would become a Slavic suburb of the German town (&quot;Wiek&quot;, &quot;Wieck&quot;). In Stettin, two &quot;Wiek&quot; suburbs were set up anew outside the walls, to which most Slavs from within the walls were resettled. Such Wiek settlements did initially not belong to the town, but to the duke, although they were likely to come into possession of the town in the course of the 14th century. Also in the 14th century, Slavic Wiek suburbs lost their Slavic character.

Indigenous Slavs and Poles faced discrimination from the arriving Germans, who on a local level since the 16th century imposed discriminatory regulations, such as bans on buying goods from Slavs/Poles or prohibiting them from becoming members of craft guilds.

===Hanseatic towns===

The towns of Pomerania that had joined the Hanseatic League acted independently from the duchy, and sometimes opposed the dukes&#x27; interest. The most powerful towns were Stralsund, Greifswald, and Stettin, but also Demmin, Anklam and Kolberg. Before the Treaty of Stralsund in 1370, and during the reign of Eric of Pomerania, the Hanseatic towns were in a state of war with Denmark for hegemony in the Baltic Sea.

Parts of the Pomeranian nobility were engaged in piracy against Hanseatic vessels. Barnim VI of Pomerania-Wolgast did not only engage in piracy himself, he is also known for providing refuge and hideouts for the Likedeeler pirate organisation.

The relation between the towns and the nobility throughout the Middle Ages ranged from alliances and support () to cabalism, banditry and outright warfare.

==Pomerania-Demmin and Pomerania-Stettin (1155–1264)==
In 1155, the duchy was partitioned in Pomerania-Demmin and Pomerania-Stettin. With short interruptions, this division lasted until 1264.

Wartislaw I was murdered between 1134 and 1148 in Stolpe. His brother, Ratibor I of Schlawe-Stolp, founded Stolpe Abbey near this site and ruled Wartislaw&#x27;s realm in place of his minor nephews, Bogislaw I and Casimir I. Ratibor died in 1155, and Wartislaw&#x27;s sons agreed to co-rule the duchy from their residences Demmin (Casimir) and Stettin (Bogislaw). Except for the terra Kolberg, which was ruled as a co-dominion, they partitioned the duchy with Pomerania-Demmin comprising the upper Peene, Tollense, Dievenow and Rega areas, and Pomerania-Stettin comprising the Oder, Ihna and lower Peene areas. When Casimir I died in 1180, Bogislaw became the sole duke. Bogislaw I took his duchy as a fief from the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) in 1181, and from the Danish king Canute VI in 1185.

When he died in 1187, his two sons Casimir II and Bogislaw II were still minors, and Stettin castellan Wartislaw (II) ruled in their place. Danish pressure resulted in Wartislaw&#x27;s replacement by Rugian prince Jaromar I, a Danish vassal, in 1189. The Principality of Rügen was extended southward on the expense of Pomerania-Demmin. When Casimir II and Bogislaw II died in 1219 and 1220, respectively, their respective sons Wartislaw III (Pomerania-Demmin) and Barnim I (Pomerania-Stettin) were still minors. Wartislaw&#x27;s mother Ingardis of Denmark thus ruled until Wartislaw was able to rule Pomerania-Demmin on his own in 1225, and Barnim, in theory duke since 1220, practically started his reign in Pomerania-Stettin only in 1233. Pomerania-Demmin lost her southern and western areas to Brandenburg, and the remainder came under Barnim&#x27;s rule after Wartislaw died in 1264.

==Territorial changes in the 13th century==

=== War with Brandenburg===
During the reign of Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg and son of Albert I of Brandenburg (1100–1170), Brandenburg claimed sovereignty over Pomerania. Yet, in 1181, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I invested Duke Bogislaw I of the Griffin House of Pomerania with the Duchy of &quot;Slavia&quot; (Pomerania). This was not accepted by the Margraviate of Brandenburg and triggered several military conflicts.

Between 1185 and 1227, Pomerania along with most of the southern Baltic coast remained under sovereignty of Denmark. However, Brandenburg again tried to gain sovereignty over Pomerania, and in 1214 for a short time conquered Stettin. After Denmark lost the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227, Denmark lost all her territories on the southern Baltic shore, including Pomerania.

At this time, the Duchy of Pomerania was co-ruled by duke Wartislaw III of Demmin and duke Barnim I of Stettin. After the Danes retreated, Brandenburg took her chance and invaded Pomerania-Demmin. In 1231, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II gave the duchy, which then was again a part of the empire, as a fief to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg.

Denmark also attempted to restore her rule and took Wolgast and Demmin in 1235, but was driven out the same year. Wartislaw had to accept Brandenburg&#x27;s overlordship in the 1236 Treaty of Kremmen, furthermore he had to hand over most of his duchy to Brandenburg immediately, that was the Burg Stargard Land and adjacent areas (all soon to become a part of Mecklenburg, forming the bulk of the later Mecklenburg-Strelitz area). Circipania was already lost to Mecklenburg in the years before.

In the 1250 Treaty of Landin between Pomeranian dukes and margraves of Brandenburg, Barnim I managed to reassert the rule of his Griffin house over Pomerania, but lost the Uckermark to Brandenburg.

Brandenburg since 1250 expanded eastward. In 1250–52, the margraves gained half of Lebus Land, including the terra Küstrin between Warthe and Mietzel (Myśla), and the terra Chinz north of the Mietzel river, both previously held by Barnim. In the course of the 1250s, the margraves further gained the castellanies Zantoch and Driesen except for the burghs itself, of both castellanies actually belonging to Greater Poland, Barnim had held the northern parts. In 1261, Barnim lost the Soldin area, and in the following years the terra Zehden to Brandenburg.

In 1264, Duke Wartislaw III of Demmin died, his cousin Barnim I (the Good) became the sole ruler of the duchy. In 1266, Barnim I married Mechthild, the daughter of Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg.

In 1269, Barnim lost the terra Arnswalde to the margraves. Before his death, he bought the western part back in 1278.

Bogislaw IV lost the Bernstein area and Zinnenburg Land (terra Arnhausen and terra Schivelbein), in 1280. All former Pomeranian territories east of the Oder lost to Brandenburg in the 13th century became parts of the Brandenburgian Neumark (&quot;new march&quot;).

===War with Silesia===

In 1234 and 1241, Silesian dukes Henry I and Henry II expanded their realm to the North, and even took control of areas north of the Warthe (Warta) river previously held by the Dukes of Pomerania. The Griffin dukes, Silesian Piasts, Dukes of Greater Poland, the bishops of Lebus and the bishops of Kammin all competed for the Warthe/Netze (Notec) area, centered around the burgh of Zantoch. Until 1250, Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania had recovered most of the previous Pomeranian territory and sought to secure them with the settlement of Germans, while Zantoch burgh was held by Przemysł II of Greater Poland.

===Competition for Schlawe-Stolp===
The last member of the Ratiborides branch of the Griffins, Ratibor II, died in 1223. This led to a competition between the Griffins and the Pomerelian Samborides for inheritance of Schlawe-Stolp. Because Ratibor died during the Danish period, Denmark administered the area until she had to withdraw after the lost Battle of Bornhöved in 1227. Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania, took control of the lands immediately after the Danish withdrawal, but had to yield Pomerelian duke Swantopolk&#x27;s rights, whose relationship to the Ratiborides was closer. Swantopolk took over Schlawe-Stolp in 1235–36. The Griffins mounted an unsuccessful campaigns to gain the area in 1236–38, 1253, 1259, and 1266. After the death of Swantopolk II in 1266, Barnim I took over the area and kept it until 1269, when Rugian prince Wizlaw II took over. He withdrew in 1277 and left the area to Brandenburg. In 1283, Mestwin II of Pomerelia took over. Competition arose anew after his death in 1294. In 1296, Wizlaw&#x27;s son Sambor launched another campaign.

==Pomerania-Wolgast and -Stettin after the partition of 1295==


The last duke of Demmin had died in 1264, and the 1236 territorial losses left Demmin at the westernmost edge of the Duchy of Pomerania.

When Barmin I, for a short period sole ruler of the duchy, died in 1278, his oldest son Bogislaw IV took his father&#x27;s seat. When his half-brothers Otto I and Barnim II reached adulthood in 1294, the brothers ruled in common until Barnim&#x27;s death in 1295. Bogislaw and Otto now agreed on a partition of the duchy, that would last until 1464: Bogislaw&#x27;s share was the area where the towns were under Lübeck law, that was Vorpommern north of the Peene river (though including Anklam and Demmin on its southern bank) and Farther Pomerania north of the Ihna and Stepenitz rivers, both areas were connected by the islands of Usedom and Wollin. Bogislaw made Wolgast his residence, thus the partition became known as Pomerania-Wolgast. Otto&#x27;s share was the remainder between Peene and Ihna centered around Stettin, where the towns were under Magdeburg law. This partition became known as Pomerania-Stettin.

A series of wars was triggered by Denmark in the early 14th century, when Eric VI Menved attempted to reestablish Danish rule in Northern Germany. Pomeranian and Rugian towns and dukes were involved in these wars in various and often opposing coalitions. Since 1314, a coalition consisting mainly of Waldemar of Brandenburg, Stralsund, and the Pomeranian dukes opposed a Danish-led coalition joined by Rugian duke Wizlaw III. This war was ended by the Treaty of Templin in 1317. During this conflict, in 1315, Wartislaw IV of Pomerania-Wolgast, grandson of Rugian Wizlaw II, made an agreement with Eric VI Menved&#x27;s brother Christopher II of Denmark for inheritance of the Principality of Rügen.

Waldemar of Brandenburg died in 1319. Heinrich, his heir, was still a minor, and died in 1320. The Pomeranian dukes and Cammin bishops tried to take advance of Brandenburg&#x27;s weakness. They did not only envision territorial gains, but also aimed at changing the status of the duchy from a fief of Brandenburg to a fief directly from the emperor. To achieve these goals, the dukes allied with various neighboring states, mounted military campaigns of which the first Battle of Kremmer Damm in 1332 was the most important, and gave their lands to the Cammin bishops (in 1320) and even to pope John XXII (in 1330 or 1331). In 1337, the Brandenburg margrave had to take the terrae Lippehne, Schivelbein and Falkenberg (all in Neumark) as a fief from the Cammin bishops. In 1338, Barnim III of Pomerania-Stettin was granted his part-duchy as a fief directly from the emperor, while Pomerania-Wolgast remained under formal Brandenburgian overlordship.

The towns Stettin, Greifenhagen, and Gollnow in Pomerania-Stettin, concerned about a permanent division of the duchy in case Barnim III would not have children, rebelled in 1339 and sided with Pomerania-Wolgast in 1341. Barnim had to move his court to Gartz (Oder). On 12 June 1348 German king and later emperor Karl IV granted the Duchy of Pomerania as a whole and the Rugian principality as a fief to the dukes of both Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast, erasing Brandenburg&#x27;s claims, which however was not accepted by Brandenburg until 1529. The Pomeranian dukes and towns reconciled in 1344–54.

Barnim III, against the will of the burghers, erected a castle within Stettin&#x27;s walls in 1346 (the old burgh had been leveled in 1249), and gained from Brandenburg the eastern parts of the Uckermark, that was in 1354 Pasewalk, in 1355 Schwedt, Angermünde, and Brüssow, and in 1359 (Torgelow).

===Gain of Schlawe-Stolp (1317–47)===

In 1316–17, the Griffin duke of Pomerania-Wolgast took over these areas as a fief from Waldemar of Brandenburg. In 1347, the area became fully attached to Pomerania-Wolgast. The lands of Stolp were pawned to the Teutonic Order from 1329 to 1341, the Bütow area was bought by the Knights in 1329 and thus remained outside Pomerania-Wolgast.

===Gain of the Principality of Rügen (1325–1356)===

The Rugian Prince Wizlaw III died in 1325. Because of the earlier death of his son, he had no male heir, and Wartislaw IV of Pomerania-Wolgast took over the principality according to the 1315 agreement with Christopher II of Denmark. Yet, in the meantime Christopher&#x27;s throne had been challenged by Valdemar III of Denmark, and Christopher had granted Rugia to Mecklenburg for her aid against his opponent. After Wartislaw died in 1326, Mecklenburg invaded the principality, triggering the First War for Rugian Succession (). Wartislaw&#x27;s minor sons were aided by primarily by Greifswald and Demmin, but also by Stralsund, Anklam, and Valdemar III, who decisively defeated the Mecklenburgian army in 1228 near Völschow. In the subsequent Treaty of Brudersdorf, Mecklenburg withdrew her claims for 31,000 mark in silver. In exchange, the terrae Tribsees, Grimmen and Barth were pawned to her. When the Pomeranian dukes in 1340 were not able to bail out these lands, but refused to formally hand them over, the Second War for Rugian Succession (). This time, the dukes of Pomerania-Wolgast were aided by those of Pomerania-Stettin and the Counts of Gützkow. After the Pomeranian forces defeated the Mecklenburgians in the Battle of Schopendamm near Loitz in 1351, they were able to take Grimmen and Barth in 1354 and Tribsees in 1356. Mecklenburg dropped her claims thereafter. Another party in these wars for Rugian succession was the bishop of Schwerin, who sought to enforce his claims by legal means, but was not successful in his appeals to various ecclesial courts.

==Partition of Pomerania-Wolgast (1368–72): Pomerania-Wolgast and Pomerania-Stolp==

After the death of Barnim IV of Pomerania-Wolgast in 1366, an armed conflict arose when Barnim&#x27;s brother Bogislaw V refused to share his power with Barnim&#x27;s sons, Wartislaw VI and Bogislaw VI, and his other brother, Wartislaw V, who in turn allied with Mecklenburg to enforce their claims. On 25 May 1368 a compromise was negotiated in Anklam, which was made a formal treaty on 8 June 1372 in Stargard, and resulted in a partition of Pomerania-Wolgast.

Bogislaw V received most of the Farther Pomeranian parts. Excepted was the land of Neustettin, which was to be ruled by his brother Wartislaw V, and was integrated into Bogislaw&#x27;s part-duchy only after his death in 1390. This eastern part duchy became known as Pomerania-Stolp.

==Between the partition of 1368 and the reunification in 1478==

=== Further partition of Pomerania-Wolgast (1376–1425): Pomerania-Wolgast and Pomerania-Barth===

The western remainder of Pomerania-Wolgast was further partitioned between Bogislaw IV and Wartislaw VI on 6 December 1376. Wartislaw VI received Pomerania-(Wolgast)-Barth, the former principality of Rügen, and Bogislaw IV&#x27;s Pomerania-Wolgast was reduced to an area between Greifswald and the Swine river. When Bogislaw VI died in 1393 and Wartislaw VI in 1394, the latter&#x27;s sons Barnim VI and Wartislaw VIII ruled in common.

On 6 December 1425 the western part of Pomerania-Wolgast (without Pomerania-Stolp) was partitioned again at a congress in Eldena Abbey, this time among the Wartislaw IX and his brother Barnim VII, who received the eastern part with Wolgast, and their cousins Swantibor II and his brother Barnim VIII, who received the Rugian part with Barth.

In 1456, the University of Greifswald was founded on behalf of Greifswald&#x27;s burgomaster Heinrich Rubenow, becoming the first university of Pomerania and one of the oldest in northern Europe.

===Pomerania-Stolp===

The situation of the descendants of Bogislaw V, who ruled Pomerania-Stolp, differed somewhat from the situation of their western counterparts. The area was more sparsely settled and dominated by powerful noble families, so not much income could be derived by the dukes. On the other hand, the Stolpian branch of the House of Pomerania had relatives among the royal houses of Denmark and Poland. Casimir IV and Elisabeth, the children of Bogislaw V and his first wife Elisabeth, the daughter of Casimir III of Poland, where both raised at the Polish court in Kraków. Elisabeth would become Holy Roman Empress after her marriage with Charles IV, and Casimir was adopted by and designated heir of his grandfather. Yet, his ambitions were swarted when Ludwig of Hungary overruled the testament of Casimir of Poland in 1370, Casimir of Pomerania-Stolp only for a short time took the land of Dobrin as a fief. Eric II of Pomerania-Stolp, grand-grandchild of Danish king Valdemar IV in contrast became king of the Kalmar Union in 1397.

Eric however failed in his most ambitious plan, to make Bogislaw IX of Pomerania-Stolp king of both the Kalmar Union and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Eric had to leave Denmark in 1449 and ruled Pomerania-Rügenwalde, a small partition of Pomerania-Stolp, until his death in 1459.

Pomerania-Stolp was a crucial point in the Knights&#x27; land supply route. Bogislaw VIII of Pomerania-Stolp allied with both the Teutonic Knights and Poland, but supported the latter after the war had started in 1409 by blocking his lands for the Knights&#x27; troops and allowing his nobles to kidnap those who were travelling his lands. For his aid, he was granted the Lauenburg (now Lębork) and Bütow (now Bytów) areas (Lauenburg and Bütow Land) and others, but those were lost in the First Peace of Thorn in 1411.

===Pomerania-Stettin===

Casimir V of Pomerania-Stettin at the same time allied with the Teutonic Knights and took part in the Battle of Grunwald, where he was caught by the Poles and bailed out by the Knights after the First Peace of Thorn.

The main concern of the Stettin dukes however was Brandenburg, namely the Neumark and Uckermark regions. Casimir III died in 1372 during a siege of Königsberg (Neumark), after he had managed to receive an Imperial approval of his Uckermark possessions in 1370. On 17 May 1373 all dukes of Pomerania concluded an alliance in Kaseburg, but situation eased when Otto VII, Margrave-elector of Brandenburg abdicated on 15 August 1373, and the House of Luxembourg took over the march on October 2 of the same year. In 1374, the Luxembourgians allied with all branches of the House of Pomerania. Pomeranian dukes even held positions in the march&#x27;s administration.

When Brandenburg changed hands from the House of Luxembourg to the House of Hohenzollern on 11 January 1411 the dukes of Pomerania-Stettin understood their position endangered and reacted with warfare. The first major battle was the second Battle of Kremmer Damm on 24 October 1412. While the dukes of Pomerania-Wolgast had sided with the emperor, disappointment over the emperors disapproval of ridding them of formal Brandenburgian overlordship in 1417 drove them to ally with their Stettin relatives and Mecklenburg. This coalition was backed by Denmark and Poland. A series of battles culminated in a decisive defeat on 26 March 1420 in the streets of Angermünde, and the Uckermark possessions were lost once again.

===Polish–Teutonic Wars===
In 1320 and 1325, Wartislaw IV of Pomerania-Wolgast allied with the Landmeister of the State of the Teutonic Order in Prussia against king Casimir III of Poland. When the Treaty of Kalisz had ended the subsequent Polish–Teutonic War (1326–32) in 1343, Wartislaw&#x27;s sons Bogislaw V, Barnim IV and Wartislaw V changed sides, and Bogislaw V married Casimir III&#x27;s daughter, Elisabeth. Barnim III of Pomerania-Stettin joined this alliance in 1348. After Poland and Lithuania had formed the Union of Krėva in 1385, and Poland had rejected the claims of Casimir III&#x27;s grandson Casimir IV of Pomerania-Stolp, Bogislaw VIII and Wartislaw VII of Pomerania-Stolp in 1386 concluded an anti-Polish alliance with the Teutonic Knights, after they had settled their common border. In 1388, this alliance was joined by Swantibor I and Bogislaw VII of Pomerania-Stettin as well as Barnim VI and Wartislaw VI of Pomerania-Wolgast.

Later in 1388 however, the dukes of Pomerania-Stolp left this alliance and sided with Poland, who had promised to partially respect their claims as Casimir III&#x27;s heirs. Thence, the nobles of Pomerania-Stolp robbed the Teutonic Knights and their supply routes, provoking a counter-attack that destroyed many noble strongholds and the fortifications of Köslin (now Koszalin). Bogislaw VIII, Barnim V and Wartislaw VII reacted by siding with Polish king Jogaila and concluding mutual trade alleviations.

When Wartislaw VII died, Bogislaw VIII and Barnim V concluded a treaty with the Teutonic Knights to safeguard their supply routes in turn for a financial credit. Swantibor I and Bogislaw VII of Pomerania-Stettin changed sides in 1395 and allied with the knights in turn for financial aid. Barnim V in 1397 concluded an alliance with Poland, married Vytautas&#x27; niece Hedwig and was in Jogaila&#x27;s service in 1401 until he died in 1402 or 1404. Bogislaw VIII also entered into Jogaila&#x27;s service, but changed sides in 1407–08, when he allied with the Teutonic Knights and settled their common border.

Nikolaus Bock, Cammin bishop from 1398–1410, had also sided with the knights before and placed his bishopric under their suzerainty. Wartislaw VIII of Pomerania-Wolgast allied with the knights in return for an assumption of a debt and additional payments. Swantibor I and Bogislaw VII of Pomerania-Stettin joined this alliance in 1409, after they had concluded a ten-year truce with the knights in return for debt cancellation before. When the knights lost the Battle of Tannenberg in 1410, Bogislaw VIII of Pomerania-Stolp changed sides again and allied with Poland in return for the Bütow, Schlochau, Preußisch-Friedland, Baldenburg, Hammerstein and Schivelbein areas, which Poland had gained from the State of the Teutonic Order before. This was however cancelled by the First Peace of Thorn in 1411.

While Bogislaw VIII nevertheless upheld his alliance with Jogaila, Konrad Bonow of the Cammin diocese in 1414 concluded an alliance with the Teutonic Knights against both Bogislaw VIII and Jogaila, which was turned into a truce soon after. In 1417, Bogislaw VIII and the Teutonic Knights settled their common border in the Hammerstein area, ending their conflicts. Bogislaw VIII&#x27;s son Bogislaw IX together with all other Pomeranian dukes in 1423 allied with the Teutonic Knights.

====Gain of Lauenburg and Bütow Land (1455–67)====
Eric II of Pomerania-Wolgast and successor of Bogislaw IX in Pomerania-Stolp again allied with Jogaila and his son and successor Casimir IV in his Thirteen Years&#x27; War against the Teutonic Knights. On 3 January 1455 he, in turn, was granted the Lauenburg and Bütow Land at the Pomerelian frontier. When Lauenburg was retaken by the knights in 1459, the Polish king was upset and ravaged the Stolp area. Eric reconciled with the king on 21 August 1466, and bought the town from the knights on 11 October, six days before the Second Peace of Thorn, that was signed by Eric in 1467. King Casimir IV of Poland granted the area as a fief to the dukes of Pomerania and after the death of the last Duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637 the towns were re-integrated with Poland and included in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

===War with Brandenburg and the Hanseatic League (1423–1448)===

On 15 September 1423 all Pomeranian dukes (including Eric) allied with the Teutonic Knights against Brandenburg and against the Hanseatic towns. In early 1425, this coalition was joined by Mecklenburg and Poland and successfully invaded Brandenburg. A peace treaty concluded on 22 May 1427 in Eberswalde, left Pomerania with the Uckermark north of Angermünde. On 16 June 1427 this was confirmed by the Treaty of Templin, which also included a coalition of Pomerania, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg. Yet, in 1440 Pomerania and Brandenburg invaded Mecklenburg, and in 1444 Brandenburg demanded from Pomerania to again hand over the Uckermark to her. When the Pomeranians refused, war broke out again. The first Treaty of Prenzlau in 1448 set the border south of Pasewalk.

==Bogislaw X becomes sole ruler of the duchy of Pomerania (1478)==
Pomerania-Wolgast was reunited following the death of both Barnim VII and Barnim VIII in 1451. Both dukes died of the plague. The same disease caused the death of Joachim of Pomerania-Stettin (also in 1451), Ertmar and Swantibor, children of Wartislaw X, and Otto III of Pomerania-Stettin (all in 1464). Thus, the line of Pomerania-Stettin had died out.

The extinction of the House of Pomerania-Stettin triggered a conflict about inheritance with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. In the Treaty of Soldin of 1466, a compromise was negotiated: Wartislaw X and Eric II, the dukes of Pomerania, took over Pomerania-Stettin as a Brandenburgian fief. This was disputed already during the same year by the emperor, who intervened against the Brandenburgian overlordship of Pomerania. This led to a series of further warfare and truces, that were ended by the Treaty of Prenzlau of 1472, basically confirming the ruling of the Soldin treaty, but settling on a border north of Gartz (Oder) resembling Brandenburg&#x27;s recent gains. This treaty was accepted by the emperor.

In 1474, Eric II died of the plague, and his son Bogislaw X inherited Pomerania-Stolp. Bogislaw&#x27;s brothers had died the same year. After the death of his uncle Wartislaw X in 1478, he became the first sole ruler in the Duchy of Pomerania since almost 200 years.

Eric II had left Pomerania in tense conflicts with Brandenburg and Mecklenburg. Bogislaw managed to resolve these conflicts by both diplomatic and military means. He married his sister, Sophia, to Magnus II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and his other sister, Magarete, was married to Magnus&#x27; brother Balthasar. Bogislaw himself married Magareta, daughter of Brandenburg&#x27;s Prince-elector Frederick II. Also, in 1478, Bogislaw regained areas lost to Brandenburg by his father, most notably the town of Gartz and other small towns and castles north of the Brandenburgian Uckermark. During the confirmation of the Peace of Prenzlau in 1479, the border was finally settled north of Strasburg and Bogislaw had to take his possessions as a fief from Brandenburg.

==Protestant Reformation (1518–1534)==
The Protestant Reformation reached Pomerania in the early 16th century. Bogislaw X in 1518 sent his son, Barnim IX, to study in Wittenberg. In 1521, he personally attended a mass of Martin Luther in Wittenberg, and also of other reformed preachers in the following years. Also in 1521, Johannes Bugenhagen, the most important person in the following conversion of Pomerania to Protestantism, left Belbuck Abbey to study in Wittenberg, close to Luther. In Belbuck, a circle had formed before, comprising not only Bugenhagen, but also Johann Boldewan, Christian Ketelhut, Andreas Knöpke and Johannes Kureke. These persons, and also Johannes Knipstro, Paul vom Rode, Peter Suawe, Jacob Hogensee and Johann Amandus spread the Protestant idea all over Pomerania. At several occasions, this went along with public outrage, plunder and arson directed against the church.

The dukes&#x27; role in the reformation process was ambitious. Bogislaw X, despite his sympathies, forbade Protestant preaching and tumults shortly before his death. Of his sons, George I opposed, and Barnim IX supported Protestantism as did Georg&#x27;s son, Philip I. In 1531, George died, and a Landtag in Stettin formally allowed Protestant preaching, if no tumults would arise from this. On 13 December 1534 a Landtag was assembled in Treptow an der Rega, where the dukes and the nobility against the vote of Cammin bishop Erasmus von Manteuffel officially introduced Protestantism to Pomerania. Bugenhagen in the following month drafted the new church order.

The Duchy of Pomerania joined the Schmalkaldic League, but did not actively participate in the Schmalkaldic War.

==Partition of 1532: Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast==

After Bogislaw X&#x27;s death, his sons initially ruled in common. Yet, after Georg&#x27;s death, the duchy was partitioned again between Barnim IX, who resided in Stettin, and Phillip I, who resided in Wolgast. The border ran roughly along the Oder and Świna rivers, with Pomerania-Wolgast now consisting of Hither or Western Pomerania (Vorpommern, yet without Stettin and Gartz (Oder) on the Oder river&#x27;s left bank, and with Greifenberg on its right bank), and Pomerania-Stettin consisting of Farther Pomerania. The secular possessions of the Diocese of Cammin around Kolberg (Kolobrzeg) subsequently came controlled by the dukes, when members of the ducal family were made titular bishops of Cammin since 1556.

Despite the division, the duchy maintained one central government.

==Further partitions in 1569==


In 1569, Pomerania-Barth (consisting of the area around Barth, Damgarten and Richtenberg) was split off Pomerania-Wolgast to satisfy Bogislaw XIII. In the same year, Pomerania-Rügenwalde (consisting of the areas around Rügenwalde and Bütow) was split off Pomerania-Stettin to satisfy Barnim XII. Though the partitions were named similar to the earlier ones, their territory differed significantly.

In contrast to the partition of 1532, it was agreed that two governments were maintained in Wolgast and Stettin. Decisions of war and peace were to be made only by a common Landtag.

During the 1560s, Pomerania was caught between the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War for hegemony in the Baltic Sea and the struggle for hegemony in the Upper Saxon Circle of the Electorate of Saxony and Brandenburg. In 1570, the war in the Baltic ended with the Treaty of Stettin. In 1571–74, the duchy&#x27;s status regarding Brandenburg was finally settled: While an agreement of 1529 ruled Brandenburg to succeed in Pomerania once the House of Pomerania died out in turn for the final rejection of Brandenburgian claims to hold Pomerania as a fief, it was now agreed that both ruling houses had a mutual right of succession in case of the extinction of the other one.

Also in 1571, a trade war between the towns Frankfurt (Oder) (Brandenburg) and Stettin (Pomerania), ongoing since 1560, was settled in favour of Brandenburg. The struggle within the Upper Saxon Circle however went on. The Pomeranian dukes Johann Friedrich and Ernst Ludwig refused to pay their taxes to the circle&#x27;s treasury (&quot;Kreiskasten&quot; in Leipzig) properly, and in the rare cases they did, they marked it as a voluntary act. Furthermore, the dukes ratified the circle&#x27;s decrees only with caveats that made it possible for them to withdraw at any time. The Pomeranian dukes justified their actions with events of 1563, when an army led by Eric of Brunswick crossed and devastated their duchy, and the circle did not give them support. On the other hand, the Pomeranian refusal to properly integrate in the circle&#x27;s structure likewise reduced the circle&#x27;s ability to act as a unified military power.

The partitioned duchy underwent an economical recession in the late 16th century. The dukes&#x27; ability to control the inner affairs of the duchy severely declined in the course of the 16th century. As the central power was weakened by the partitions and increasingly indebted, the independence of nobles and towns rose. Attempts of Duke Johann Friedrich to strengthen the ducal position, e.g. by introducing a general tax, failed due to the resistance of the nobility, who had gained the right to veto ducal tax decrees at the circle&#x27;s convent. In 1594–1597, the duchy participated in the Ottoman Wars. Yet, due to the rejection of financial support by the nobility, the Pomeranian dukes&#x27; funds for the campaign were low, resulting in their humiliation during the war for fighting with bad horses and weapons.

==Reunification under Bogislaw XIV and partition between Sweden and Brandenburg==


Bogislaw XIV was the last Duke of Pomerania. In the course of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the duchy was occupied first by Albrecht von Wallenstein&#x27;s mercenary army after the Capitulation of Franzburg in 1627, and then by the Swedish Empire, which was appreciated and confirmed by Bogislaw in the Treaty of Stettin (1630). The duchy was finally dissolved after Bogislaw&#x27;s death in 1637. With the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, Further Pomerania was assigned to Brandenburg-Prussia who held the rights for inheritance (Province of Pomerania (1653-1815)). Hither Pomerania stayed with the Swedish Empire and henceforth became known as Swedish Pomerania. The border was settled in the Treaty of Stettin (1653). Both parts were merged into the Prussian Province of Pomerania in 1815.

==Historical subdivisions==
Furthermore, several Pomeranian duchies were co-ruled by members of the House of Pomerania:
*Pomerania-Demmin (Dymin) from 1156 on under Duke Casimir I, fell to Duke Barnim I of Pomerania after the death of Duke Wartislaw III in 1264
*Pomerania-Stolp (Słupsk) in Stargard from 1368 on under Duke Bogislaw V the Old, fell to Duke Eric II of Pomerania-Wolgast after the death of Duke Eric in 1459
*Pomerania-Barth (Bardo) from 1376 on under Duke Wartislaw VI, fell to Bogislaw X of Pomerania after the death of Duke Wartislaw X in 1478; 1569–1605 residence of Duke Bogislaw XIII
*Pomerania-Rügenwalde (Darłowo), from 1569 on apanage of Duke Barnim X, incorporated into the Duchy of Pomerania-Stettin under Duke Bogislaw XIV in 1620

==Coat of arms==

On 26 July 1530, the ducal coat of arms was reformed on behalf of Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania at the Reichstag in Augsburg. The ducal coat of arms since 1530 showed
#Pomerania-Stettin: A red griffin on a blue shield. The shield had a golden color up to 1483, and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor positively responded to Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania&#x27;s request to change the blue back to golden to follow the heraldic rules. This change, however, was never implemented.
#Pomerania: A red griffin on a silver shield.
#Cassubia: A black griffin on a golden shield. Before 1530, this was the coat of arms of Wolgast.
#Wenden: A griffin colored with three green and red stripes on a silver shield. Earlier, this griffin was red with silver wings.
#Principality of Rügen: A black lion, sometimes with a red crown, on a golden shield growing from an open red brick wall on a blue shield.
#Usedom: A silver griffin with a sturgeon tail on a red shield.
#Pomerania-Barth: A black griffin with two white fields on a golden shield.
#County of Gützkow: A red cross with 4 red roses in its angles on a golden shield.
#Pomerania-Wolgast: A white griffin on a red shield growing from an open golden brick wall on a blue shield. From 1325 to 1530, Pomerania-Wolgast had a black griffin on a golden shield. The Putbus coat of arms had been identical with the post-1530 Wolgast coat of arms, except for the color of the lower shield, which was black, and the description of the beast as an eagle.
#Another empty regalia field.

Before 1530, the coat of arms had five fields, showing four griffins symbolizing Pomerania-Stettin, Pomerania, Wenden, Cassubia, and an empty regalia field.

<text>The River class is a class of offshore patrol vessels built primarily for the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom. A total of nine were built for the Royal Navy (RN), four Batch 1 and five Batch 2. One Batch 1 (), which was the Falklands guard ship, was decommissioned and transferred at the end of its lease to the Royal Bahrain Naval Force.

The three remaining Batch 1 ships perform fisheries security and border patrol tasks in UK waters. The five new Batch 2 ships provide overseas forward presence, performing maritime security duties and disaster relief operations, often supported by a Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel.

The Batch 1 ships of the class replaced the seven ships of the and the two patrol vessels.

 was the first of two ships adapting the River design for the Royal Thai Navy and built in Thailand. The three ships of the in service with the Brazilian Navy were developed from the Batch 1 River-class design, and the Royal Navy&#x27;s Batch 2 ships were in turn based upon the &quot;Amazonas&quot; design.

==Royal Navy==
===Batch 1===
====&quot;Tyne&quot;, &quot;Severn&quot; and &quot;Mersey&quot;====

In early 2001, the Ministry of Defence placed an order with Vosper Thornycroft (VT) for three River-class offshore patrol vessels to replace the Island class. It was understood that the higher availability rates of the River class (up to 300 days per year) would enable the three new ships to perform the duties of the five ships they replaced. The Royal Navy initially leased the ships from VT under a five-year, £60 million contract. As part of the contract, VT would be responsible for all maintenance and support during the charter period. This contract was renewed in January 2007 for another five years at £52 million. However, in September 2012, instead of renewing the contract again, it was announced by the then Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that the Ministry of Defence had purchased the vessels for £39 million.

The River class are significantly larger than the Island-class vessels and have a large open deck aft allowing them to be fitted with equipment for a specific role, which can include fire-fighting, disaster relief and anti-pollution work. For this purpose, a capacity crane is fitted. In addition, the deck is strong enough for the transport of various tracked and wheeled light vehicles, or an LCVP. The class are primarily used with the Fishery Protection Squadron and EEZ patrol. In 2009, the average running costs for the River class were reported in Parliament at an estimated £20 million: &quot;These figures, based on the expenditure incurred by the Ministry of Defence in 2009–10, include maintenance, safety certification, military upgrades, manpower, inventory, satellite communication, fuel costs and depreciation.&quot;

On 24 April 2017, in a written answer to a question raised by Sir Nicholas Soames, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence Harriett Baldwin stated &quot;Severn&quot; would be decommissioned in 2017, with &quot;Mersey&quot; and &quot;Clyde&quot; following in 2019. &quot;Severn&quot; was decommissioned in a ceremony at Portsmouth on 27 October 2017, with &quot;Tyne&quot; due to follow in May 2018; however, the latter was brought back into service due to defects with &quot;Forth&quot;.

In March 2018, Baldwin&#x27;s successor as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence, Guto Bebb, announced that £12.7m had been allocated from the &quot;EU Exit Preparedness Fund&quot; to maintain the three Batch 1 ships to control and enforce UK waters and fisheries following the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union. On 22 November 2018, the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, formally announced that the first three Batch 1 River-class ships would be retained in service.

HMS &quot;Tyne&quot;, &quot;Mersey&quot; and &quot;Severn&quot; are now part of the Offshore Division of the Coastal Forces Squadron (the renamed 1st Patrol Boat Squadron).

====&quot;Clyde&quot;====

In February 2005, the Ministry of Defence placed an order with VT for the charter of a fourth modified River-class offshore patrol vessel. This fourth ship, , was constructed at Portsmouth Dockyard and replaced the two s for duties around the South Atlantic and the Falkland Islands. To fulfil this role, &quot;Clyde&quot; incorporates several modifications, including an extended length hull, a top speed of , a 30 mm cannon, two miniguns and mountings for five general purpose machine guns. &quot;Clyde&quot;″s elongated hull permits a strengthened flight deck able to accommodate an AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin-sized helicopter. The ship has a full load displacement between 1,850 and 2,000 tonnes. &quot;Clyde&quot; was capable of temporarily embarking up to 110 troops and their equipment and inserting them anywhere on the Falkland Islands. &quot;Clyde&quot; had a complement of 36. &quot;Clyde&quot; was decommissioned on 20 December 2019.

&quot;Clyde&quot; was not owned by the Royal Navy, but had instead been leased via a PFI public–private partnership deal with BAE Systems. While the other three were purchased outright by the M.O.D, on 7 August 2020 it was announced in a ceremony held at the HMNB Portsmouth Naval Base that &quot;Clyde&quot; had been transferred to the Royal Bahrain Naval Force, with the ship renamed as &quot;Al-Zubara&quot;.

===Batch 2===
====&quot;Forth&quot;, &quot;Medway&quot;, &quot;Trent&quot;====

On 6 November 2013 it was announced that the British Government had signed an Agreement in Principle to build three new offshore patrol vessels, based on the River-class design, at a fixed price of £348 million including spares and support for the Royal Navy. In August 2014, BAE Systems signed the contract to build the ships at their BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships shipyards in Glasgow on the River Clyde. The Ministry of Defence stated that the Batch 2 ships are capable of being used for constabulary duties such as &quot;counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti-smuggling operations&quot;. According to BAE Systems, the vessels are designed to be deployed globally, conducting anti-piracy, counter-terrorism and anti-smuggling tasks currently conducted by frigates and destroyers. Steel was cut on 10 October 2014 and the class started entering service from 2017, with the last being delivered in August 2020. The ships are built at the BAE Systems Govan shipyard, then transferred to the BAE Systems Scotstoun shipyard for fitting out.

The Batch 2 ships are fundamentally different in appearance and capabilities from the preceding Batch 1. Notable differences include the long hull, a top speed of , a flight deck that can take an AgustaWestland Merlin helicopter, a displacement of around 2,000 tonnes and greatly expanded capacity for accommodating troops. The Batch 2 ships also have a different (full width) superstructure, and a fundamentally different above-water hullform shape (greater bow flare, different and less-pronounced forward knuckle line compared to the Batch 1 ships, lack of the distinctive forward and aft bulwarks of the Batch 1 vessels). The class is also fitted with the Kelvin Hughes SharpEye integrated radar system for navigation, the Terma Scanter 4100 2D radar for air and surface surveillance, and a BAE CMS-1 &quot;Combat Management System&quot;.

Batch 2 are also the first Royal Navy ships fitted with the BAE Systems Shared Infrastructure operating system. BAE describes Shared Infrastructure as &quot;a state-of-the-art system that will revolutionise the way ships operate by using virtual technologies to host and integrate the sensors, weapons and management systems that complex warships require. Replacing multiple large consoles dedicated to specific tasks with a single hardware solution reduces the number of spares required to be carried onboard and will significantly decrease through-life costs.&quot;

The class has been criticised in evidence to the Commons Defence Select Committee: lacking a helicopter hangar, something that will limit usefulness of the helicopter deck by preventing embarkation of a helicopter for anything other than very short periods; lacking a medium calibre gun (such as 76 mm); and poor value for money. It is argued that because of the lack of these features - which could have been incorporated for the price - the vessels will not be as capable in the ocean-going patrol capacity as claimed. A criticism of the class is that the reasoning behind their commissioning was simply to ensure that public money continued to support BAE dockyards and jobs prior to the ordering of the Type 26 frigate.

The Batch 2 ships for the Royal Navy include some 29 modifications and enhancements over the built by BAE Systems for the Brazilian Navy. The Royal Navy ships are built to more stringent naval standards, with features such as magazine protection, improved hull integrity and fire safety modifications, as well as greater redundancy.

The first, HMS &quot;Forth&quot;, was christened at a ceremony at the BAE Systems Scotstoun shipyard in Glasgow on 9 March 2017. &quot;Forth&quot; replaced HMS &quot;Clyde&quot; as the Falkland Islands guardship in December 2019.

All Batch 2 ships will fulfil forward presence tasks, permanently stationed overseas with rotating crews, releasing the Type 23 frigates which previously filled the roles for other duties. HMS &quot;Medway&quot; was commissioned in September 2019 and in January 2020 deployed as the long-term Atlantic Patrol Task (North) ship in the Caribbean.

HMS &quot;Trent&quot; was commissioned in August 2020 and immediately deployed to the Mediterranean on anti-people smuggling tasks. The 2021 defence white paper announced that she would henceforth be permanently based in Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Guinea.

====&quot;Tamar&quot; and &quot;Spey&quot;====

The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 announced a further purchase of two more Batch 2 ships at an undisclosed date in the future. Expectations at the time were that this would encompass the three Batch 2 ships announced in 2013, the two additional Batch 2 ships announced in the 2015 defence review, and the modified Batch 1 ship, &quot;Clyde&quot;. The three Batch 1 ships without flight decks would be withdrawn in favour of the newer ships. The defence review suggested that the ships could be used to increase the Royal Navy&#x27;s ability to defend UK interests at home and abroad.

During a Defence Select Committee in July 2016, the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones indicated that the option for a fleet of &quot;up to six&quot; offshore patrol vessels had been reduced to five, with &quot;Clyde&quot; being replaced by , a new Batch 2 ship. The First Sea Lord also elaborated on the potential uses for the Batch 2 ships overseas, including the possibility of basing an extra ship at the Falklands Islands, or forward basing it elsewhere.

A £287m order for the two new ships, and support for all five Batch 2 ships, was announced on 8 December 2016. HM Ships &quot;Tamar&quot; and &quot;Spey&quot; would join the fleet in 2020 and 2021 respectively, both fulfilling overseas Forward Presence roles and releasing Type 23 frigates for roles more suited to a higher-capability warship.

On 21 April 2017, with construction of HMS &quot;Tamar&quot; already under way, the first steel was cut for HMS &quot;Spey&quot;. Like their predecessors, the ships were constructed at the BAE Systems Govan shipyard, then transferred to the Scotstoun shipyard for fitting out.

&quot;Tamar&quot; arrived at her home port of Portsmouth for the first time on 2 April 2020, joining HMS &quot;Trent&quot;. She would spend the rest of the year training before commissioning and deploying. HMS &quot;Spey&quot; began contractor sea trials in September 2020, arriving in her home port of Portsmouth for the first time on 30 October 2020. HMS &quot;Spey&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Navy in Portsmouth on 18 June 2021.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, in an emergency the Royal Navy might have to attach anti-ship missiles to its Batch 2 River-class patrol ships to make up for its lack of surface warfare frigates and destroyers, and additional upgrades could include attaching a Bofors 57 mm gun. However, no such weapons fit had yet been authorised for the River-class ships.

On 7 September 2021 both HMS &quot;Spey&quot; and HMS &quot;Tamar&quot; left Portsmouth to be forward deployed to the Indo-Pacific region. It is anticipated that they will not return for a minimum of 5 years and could stay in the region for up to 10 years.

==Foreign orders==
===Brazilian Navy===
Three vessels of the based on the River class were built by BAE in the United Kingdom. They were originally intended to be exported for use by the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force; however, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago cancelled the order in September 2010. In December 2011 it was reported that the Brazilian Navy were interested in buying the vessels, and possibly up to five additional vessels of the same design. The sale, for £133 million (compared to an original £150m), was then confirmed on 2 January 2012.

===Royal Thai Navy===
 was the first modified River-class vessel built for the Royal Thai Navy. The ship was built in Thailand but with design, technology transfer and support provided by BAE Systems. In January 2016 it was announced that a contract had been signed to provide the Royal Thai Navy with a second ship based on the River-class OPV to be built under licence at Bangkok Dock Company. This second Thai-built ship, was launched in August 2019 fitted with four RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles not present on &quot;Krabi&quot;. The new vessel was commissioned less than two months later.

He was born in Dudley, Worcestershire, England, where he did part-time work at Dudley Zoo from the age of 12. In 1969, he moved to Jersey, to work full-time with the apes at Jersey Zoo (now Durrell Wildlife Park), but &quot;watching people watching animals taught me conservation in the wild is essential&quot; and relocated to north Cornwall, to make his living as a musician.

He has been an active campaigner on local community issues in Cornwall, notably as part of the Lowermoor Support Group for people affected by the Camelford water pollution incident.

==Music==

<text>Fergal O&#x27;Brien (born 8 March 1972) is an Irish retired professional snooker player who competed on the World Snooker Tour from 1991 to 2024. He won one ranking title during his career, defeating Anthony Hamilton 9–7 in the final of the 1999 British Open. He was runner-up at the 2001 Masters, where he lost the final 9–10 to Paul Hunter. His best performance at the World Snooker Championship was reaching the quarter-finals of the 2000 event, where he lost 5–13 to eventual champion Mark Williams. He reached his highest world ranking of ninth in the 2000–01 season, but spent only three seasons of his 33-year career ranked inside the top 16. He retired from professional competition at the end of the 2023–24 season, intending to remain active in the sport as a coach and a commentator for Eurosport.

==Career==
O&#x27;Brien is the only player to score a century in their first frame at the World Championships in the Crucible, which he achieved against Alan McManus in 1994 (though he lost the match 10–7 and did not qualify again until 1998). His greatest achievement was winning the British Open in 1999, beating Anthony Hamilton 9–7 in the final. Hamilton opened with two centuries, but O&#x27;Brien won five frames on the final black to defeat the Nottingham man.

O&#x27;Brien also came close to winning the Masters title in 2001. After beating Mark Williams, Ken Doherty and Dave Harold, he lost in the final to Paul Hunter after leading 7–3. He has reached one further ranking final, and three semi-finals

O&#x27;Brien peaked at No. 9 in the rankings following his sole title, but nosedived after this. He narrowly retained his top 16 place for the 2001/2002 season, but dropped out a year later – and then out of the top 32 a year later. Three further falls down the rankings left him at No. 45, before beginning to recover.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s best run at the World Championship is the quarter-final and 2005 he became the first player to beat John Parrott in a World Championship qualifier.
O&#x27;Brien started the 2007–08 campaign in Shanghai where he had beaten Paul Davies and Barry Hawkins in qualifying rounds, however, he lost to Steve Davis in the first round. O&#x27;Brien also qualified for the Grand Prix but lost four of his group matches to finish 5th in his group ahead of only Graeme Dott.

After qualifying for the main draw of the 2007 Northern Ireland Trophy by beating Barry Pinches in a deciding frame, O&#x27;Brien went on to beat Dave Harold in the first round of the main draw. Victories over John Higgins (in a decider), Barry Hawkins and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, before he reached the second ranking-event final of his career by beating Mark Allen by 6 frames to 3. He lost the final to Stephen Maguire, 5–9. This run helped him return to the top 32 of the Snooker world rankings 2007/2008, but the early part of the 2008–09 season proved disappointing, O&#x27;Brien not reaching the last sixteen of any of the first four tournaments.

As of the end of 2009 O&#x27;Brien had compiled 101 competitive century breaks in his career.

He qualified for the Players Tour Championship 2011/2012 – Finals held in Galway but lost his Last 24 match 0–4 to Joe Perry.

On 12 April 2017, O’Brien qualified for the 2017 World Snooker Championship after a record-breaking victory in the final qualifying round match against David Gilbert. The final frame set the record for the longest frame of the modern era, lasting 123 minutes and 41 seconds.

<text>In mathematics, particularly algebraic topology, cohomotopy sets are particular contravariant functors from the category of pointed topological spaces and basepoint-preserving continuous maps to the category of sets and functions. They are dual to the homotopy groups, but less studied.

==Overview==
The &quot;p&quot;-th cohomotopy set of a pointed topological space &quot;X&quot; is defined by

:formula_1

the set of pointed homotopy classes of continuous mappings from formula_2 to the &quot;p&quot;-sphere formula_3.

For &quot;p&quot; = 1 this set has an abelian group structure, and is called the Bruschlinsky group. Provided formula_2 is a CW-complex, it is isomorphic to the first cohomology group formula_5, since the circle formula_6 is an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type formula_7. 

A theorem of Heinz Hopf states that if formula_2 is a CW-complex of dimension at most &quot;p&quot;, then formula_9 is in bijection with the &quot;p&quot;-th cohomology group formula_10.

The set formula_9 also has a natural group structure if formula_2 is a suspension formula_13, such as a sphere formula_14 for formula_15.

If &quot;X&quot; is not homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex, then formula_5 might not be isomorphic to formula_17. A counterexample is given by the Warsaw circle, whose first cohomology group vanishes, but admits a map to formula_6 which is not homotopic to a constant map.

==Properties==
Some basic facts about cohomotopy sets, some more obvious than others:

* formula_19 for all &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.
* For formula_20 and formula_21, the group formula_22 is equal to formula_23. (To prove this result, Lev Pontryagin developed the concept of framed cobordism.)
* If formula_24 has formula_25 for all &quot;x&quot;, then formula_26, and the homotopy is smooth if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are.
* For formula_2 a compact smooth manifold, formula_28 is isomorphic to the set of homotopy classes of smooth maps formula_29; in this case, every continuous map can be uniformly approximated by a smooth map and any homotopic smooth maps will be smoothly homotopic.
* If formula_2 is an formula_31-manifold, then formula_32 for formula_33.
* If formula_2 is an formula_31-manifold with boundary, the set formula_36 is canonically in bijection with the set of cobordism classes of codimension-&quot;p&quot; framed submanifolds of the interior formula_37.
* The stable cohomotopy group of formula_2 is the colimit
:formula_39
:which is an abelian group.

==History==
Cohomotopy sets were introduced by Karol Borsuk in 1936. A systematic examination was given by Edwin Spanier in 1949. The stable cohomotopy groups were defined by Franklin P. Peterson in 1956.

<text>David Harold (born 9 December 1966) is an English former professional snooker player from Stoke-on-Trent. He was known by the nicknames of &quot;the Hard Man&quot; and &quot;the Stoke Potter&quot; (conflating his home city&#x27;s pottery industry and his profession of potting snooker balls). He was also the first player on the television circuit to sport a plaster on his chin as a guide for his cue, which is a practice now adopted by Graeme Dott. As an amateur he played as David Harold, but after turning professional in 1991 he was registered as Dave Harold.
He won one ranking title, reached two further finals and several semi-finals, and spent four seasons ranked among the top 16. Harold was renowned for both his very strong defensive play and his unusual cue-action, with which he is able to unleash a great deal of power on a shot without using backswing on the cue. Despite safety play ultimately being considered his strong point, he compiled 143 century breaks. Steve Davis has commented that he is not the most naturally gifted player, but makes up for this with strong tactical play. For his technique and grinding play he has been compared to Cliff Thorburn.

==Career==

===Early career===

Soon after turning professional, Harold won the 1993 Asian Open, beating Darren Morgan 9–3 in the final. Ranked 93rd in the world at the time, he became the lowest-ranked player ever to win a ranking tournament. He never repeated this achievement, although he reached his second ranking final in the 1994 Grand Prix, losing 6–9 to John Higgins.

===Top 16 (1996–2002)===

After 1994, Harold did not reach a third ranking final until 2008, although he reached a total of ten semi-finals in ranking tournaments, and was a Top-16 player for four seasons between 1995/1996 and 2001/2002, reaching a career-best position of No. 11 in the world rankings in the 1996/97 season. In the 1996 Welsh Open, he lost in the semi-finals, 1–6, to eventual winner Mark Williams.

He competed in his first and only World Championship quarter-final in the 1996 event, where he lost 7–13 to Nigel Bond. He also lost 5–6 to Bond in his 1996 British Open semi-final less than two weeks earlier.

In the 1998 Grand Prix, he knocked out Stephen Hendry and John Higgins en route to the semi-finals, but lost narrowly to eventual champion Stephen Lee. 1998 also saw him reach his first semi-final in the UK Championship, where he was defeated 9–7 by Matthew Stevens.

In the 1999 Grand Prix Harold led Mark Williams 5–3 in the semi-finals but lost 5–6. This was Harold&#x27;s last ranking semi-final until 2008, although he also reached the semis in the non-ranking 2001 Masters, defeating John Higgins and John Parrott, but losing his semi-final 5–6 to eventual runner-up Fergal O&#x27;Brien after having trailed 5–1.

===2003–2015===
Following a poor season in 2001–2002, Harold dropped out of the Top 16, down to number 29 in the World Rankings. A broken wrist sustained on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2003 saw him drop further down the rankings, out of the top 32, although he had a better 2005/2006 season. Another consistent season in 2006/2007 helped Harold back up to No. 30 in the world rankings for 2007/2008.

2007/2008 started with a quarter-final appearance in the Shanghai Masters, losing to eventual winner Dominic Dale. Harold did not get past the round robin phase of the Grand Prix, finishing fifth in his group of six players; but in the 2007 UK Championship, Harold eliminated World Number 2 Graeme Dott 9–7 in the first round to achieve a place in the last 16 of the tournament for the first time since 1999. However, he lost 2–9 in the second round to Mark Selby. He qualified for the final stages of the World Championship with a 10–4 win over Mike Dunn, but lost 10–3 at the Crucible in the first round proper to Shaun Murphy.

During a preliminary round match against local wildcard Jin Long in the 2008 China Open, Harold was locked at 4–4. He took time out before the deciding frame to leave the playing arena and consume a couple of bananas, returning replenished to finish the job with a clearance on the colours. This gave rise to the affectionate nickname &quot;Bananaman&quot; on the Betfair snooker forum, referring to a children&#x27;s TV character who gained superhuman powers. Harold also put up a battle against Shaun Murphy in the next round, but eventually lost 5–3; the last frame set a record at the time for being the longest ever in snooker history (93 minutes and 12 seconds).

Harold retained his Top 32 ranking, and started the 2008–09 season ranked at #28, his highest ranking since 2003. In the first ranking event of the new season, the 2008 Northern Ireland Trophy, he beat Ricky Walden 5–2, Graeme Dott 5–3, Stephen Lee 5–4 and defending champion Stephen Maguire to reach the semi-finals, his first appearance at that stage of a ranking event for five years. He then moved into a 5–1 lead against John Higgins and won 6–4, to reach his first final since 1994, which he lost 9–3 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. Harold&#x27;s performance in this tournament moved him up to 14th in the provisional world rankings. Harold remarked after the final that, aside from claiming the World Championship, his one other remaining ambition in the game is to score a victory over O&#x27;Sullivan, who he has never beaten in a ranking tournament. The 2008 Northern Ireland Trophy marked his tenth consecutive failure to do so.

Harold subsequently qualified for the 2008 Shanghai Masters and Grand Prix. In the former, he defeated home favourite Ding Junhui in the last 32, before losing 4–5 (from 3–0 and 4–1 up) against Steve Davis; however, in the latter he was eliminated in the first round by Ali Carter. A less successful run of results in the second half of the season saw him fall out of the Top 16 in the provisional rankings, largely due to his failure to qualify for the 2009 World Championship, although he started the 2009/2010 season ranked at No. 19, an improvement of nine places on the previous season.

Harold appeared in the Welsh Open in January 2010 but lost in the first round 5–1 to Stephen Hendry. In September he beat Shaun Murphy 3–0 in the newly formed World Open in Glasgow but subsequently lost in the next round to Jamie Cope 3–2.
The 2012–13 season saw Harold win 2 qualifying matches to reach the main stages of the 2012 Wuxi Classic, however, he lost his wildcard match to Chinese player Rouzi Maimaiti. Harold subsequently failed to qualify for the next four ranking events, losing to players such as Ali Carter, Barry Hawkins, and Cao Yupeng. He did, however, qualify for the German Masters, beating Craig Steadman 5–3 and Ryan Day 5–4 to qualify for the Last 32 of the event, where he lost 3–5 to former world champion Graeme Dott. He only won 1 more match in ranking event qualifiers for the rest of the season, culminating with a 9–10 defeat the Alfie Burden in qualifying for the World Championship. Harold played in many of the Players Tour Championship event throughout the season, his best results being three Last 16 appearances, and a further two Last 32 results, finishing 39th on the Order of Merit, outside of the Top 26 that qualified for the Finals.

Harold started the 2013–14 season ranked 50th in the world rankings. He retired in May 2015 after suffering from eyesight problems.

==Personal life==

Harold was born in Stoke-on-Trent and still lives there to this day. He is a Stoke City F.C. fan. He has three children and is separated from his wife.

<text>Bumfights is an American video series produced by Indecline Films. The debut release titled &quot;Bumfights Vol.1: A Cause for Concern&quot; features primarily high school student fights caught on tape and homeless men (most notably Rufus Hannah and Donnie Brennan) in the San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas metropolitan areas attempting amateur stunts in a style similar to the MTV series &quot;Jackass&quot;, and in one case, a fight between two homeless men resulting in severe injuries. It was produced by Ryen McPherson, Zachary Bubeck, Daniel J. Tanner, and Michael Slyman.

The video series immediately received widespread public criticism. In 2002, two of the homeless men depicted filed a lawsuit against the producers alleging they were paid to hurt themselves and beat each other. In April 2006, the four original filmmakers surrendered rights to produce any more &quot;Bumfights&quot; videos or distribute videos already made, and were obliged to pay compensation to three of the homeless men depicted in the videos, under a settlement announced shortly before the 2002 lawsuit was due to go to trial.

==Reception==
By June 2002, 250,000 copies of the first volume of the series were reported sold for $22 each, according to &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. Community complaints led to the police investigating whether any laws were broken by producers. Advocacy groups were critical of the video.

== Production history ==
The videos were originally produced in the early 2000s. The videos had gained such popularity that, by 2002, there were large volumes of sales and merchandise. Around that time, the four original founders sold the business to two Las Vegas businessmen, who went by the pseudonyms Ty Beeson and Ray Leticia, for $1.5 million USD. Beeson and Leticia released the three following videos, volumes 4, including footage that was provided as part of their purchase of the business.

==&quot;Indecline: Vol. 1—&quot;It&#x27;s Worse Than You Think&quot;&quot;==
Ryen McPherson moved on to produce a similar reality video called &quot;Indecline: Vol.1—It&#x27;s Worse Than You Think&quot;. Though controversial for its fight footage and acts of elaborate graffiti art, legal troubles did not hinder the sales of this video, although the website went offline in June 2008. The Indecline web site went back online in November 2008.

==&quot;Bumfights&quot; videos==

* &quot;Bumfights Vol. 2: Bumlife&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Bumfights Vol. 3: The Felony Footage&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Bumfights Vol. 4: Return of Ruckus&quot; (2006)

== Appearance on &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; ==
Phil McGraw, host of the talk show &quot;Dr.Phil&quot;, invited Beeson to guest on the show on December 12, 2006. Beeson attended the interview dressed in a Dr.Phil costume and a shaved head in outright mockery of Dr.Phil himself. After some &quot;Bumfights&quot; clips were previewed to the audience, Dr.Phil immediately declined to interview Beeson with security menacing the &quot;Bumfights&quot; representative to be escorted from the stage. While briefly onstage, Beeson critiqued what he perceived as Dr.Phil&#x27;s hypocrisy; being outraged over their exploitation of the poor while he himself exploited people in distress for entertainment on his show. Dr.Phil revealed in the next segment he himself had been homeless. McPherson and Slyman later claimed that the man who appeared on the show was not Beeson, but in fact someone impersonating him, organized by the real Beeson and Leticia.

<doc id="682734" wikidata="Q206247" url="?curid=682734" title="Quim (footballer, born 1975)">
<text>Joaquim Manuel Sampaio da Silva (born 13 November 1975), known as Quim (), is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

He appeared in 396 Primeira Liga matches during his professional career, over 12 seasons with Braga, six with Benfica and one with Aves, and won five major titles with the second club.

Quim represented Portugal at the 2006 World Cup and in two European Championships, earning 32 caps.

==Club career==
===Braga===
Born in Vila Nova de Famalicão, Braga District, Quim started his career at S.C. Braga.

He played his first game in the Primeira Liga during the 1994–95 season, becoming the club&#x27;s first-choice shortly after.

===Benfica===
On 7 July 2004, Quim joined S.L. Benfica on a five-year contract, sharing the goal with José Moreira in the title-winning 2004–05. He began the following campaign as starter, but injury to him as well as Moreira saw Marcelo Moretto being signed during the winter break, controversially earning a place in the starting eleven.

Quim&#x27;s fortunes turned around at the beginning of 2006–07, as new coach Fernando Santos announced that he would be his main goalkeeper. Subsequently, the player rarely put in a bad performance since regaining first-choice status, even when the manager was dismissed early into the next season.

In 2008–09, with Benfica retaining the same three goalkeepers under Quique Sánchez Flores, Quim started the campaign, lost the job to Moreira in between, was even demoted to third-string (with Moretto starting in the Taça da Liga) and finished again as starter, with the team eventually ranking third. He also took the field in the final of the latter competition, and saved three penalty shoot-out attempts against Sporting CP for the win.

===Braga return===
In the 2009–10 season, Quim played all the matches and minutes as Benfica won the league for the first time in five years, adding to this the honour of conceding the least goals (20). At the end of June 2010, however, the 34-year-old was released, returning to first professional club Braga on a three-year deal, but spent his first year on the sidelines nursing an achilles tendon injury.

Quim returned as first choice for 2011–12, helping Braga to the third place with the subsequent qualification for the UEFA Champions League. However, after the arrival of Beto from FC Porto the following campaign, he made only six competitive appearances in its first part, including once in the league against S.C. Beira-Mar and the 1–2 Champions League home loss to Galatasaray SK.

After Beto left for Sevilla FC in January 2013 Quim was reinstated as the starter, one of his first appearances being a 0–0 home draw with his former side Benfica in the League Cup semi-finals, won in a penalty shootout. Manager José Peseiro also selected him for the competition&#x27;s decider against Porto, where a penalty by Alan signified the game&#x27;s only goal and Braga&#x27;s first trophy win in 47 years.

===Later years===
In May 2013, Quim announced he would not renew his contract and subsequently retire after 19 years as a professional; he played his last match on the 11th against C.D. Nacional, a 1–3 home loss for his 382nd game in the Portuguese top division. However, two months later, he went back on his decision and signed for C.D. Aves in the Segunda Liga.

On 17 May 2016, Quim renewed his contract for another year. He was still first-choice in 2016–17, when his team returned to the top flight after ten years.

In the following season, Quim faced stiff competition from newly signed Adriano Facchini in the league, but the 42-year-old started in the club&#x27;s victorious run in the Taça de Portugal, which marked its first major conquest in 87 years of history. He remained connected to Aves after his retirement, as director of Institutional Relations.

Quim worked as a goalkeeper coach subsequently, at Aves, Rio Ave FC, F.C. Tirsense and C.D. Trofense.

==International career==
After representing his country at every level from the under-16s upwards, and winning the UEFA European Under-19 Championship (then under-18) in 1994, Quim made his senior debut in August 1999 in a 4–0 victory over Andorra, after which he was Portugal&#x27;s third-choice at UEFA Euro 2000, enjoying a short cameo as a substitute in the 3–0 win against Germany in the group stage&#x27;s final round before establishing himself as number one in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. However, he missed out on the competition held in South Korea and Japan after testing positive for nandrolone on 15 February and being handed a six-month suspension.

Quim was a backup for the national side during both Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup, behind the habitual Ricardo. He was originally named in the squad for Euro 2008 but suffered a wrist injury the day before their first game, ruling him out of the tournament – he was replaced by Porto&#x27;s Nuno.

Quim started the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign as first-choice, but lost his place midway through it to another Braga player, Eduardo, as Portugal eventually qualified. After being league champion for Benfica, he would be left out of the squad for the final stages in South Africa.

<text>Suriname is divided into 10 districts ().

==Overview==


==History==
The country was first divided up into subdivisions by the Dutch on 8 October 1834, when a Royal Decree declared that there were to be 8 divisions and 2 districts:
*Upper Suriname and Torarica
*Para
*Upper Commewijne
*Upper Cottica and Perica
*Lower Commewijne
*Lower Cottica
*Matapica
*Saramacca
*Coronie (district)
*Nickerie (district)

The divisions were areas near the capital city, Paramaribo, and the districts were areas further away from the city.

In 1927, Suriname&#x27;s districts were revised, and the country was divided into 7 districts. In 1943, 1948, 1949, 1952 and 1959 further small modifications were made. In 1968 the districts were redrawn again, into
*Nickerie
*Coronie
*Saramacca
*Brokopondo
*Para
*Suriname
*Paramaribo
*Commewijne
*Marowijne

These divisions remained until 1980, when yet again, the borders of the districts were redrawn, however, with the following requirements: 
*Changes in the old boundaries were made only if it leads to improved functioning
*Each area should be developed
*The new boundaries should respect the identities of indigenous people.

The last changes to the districts were in 1985.

<doc id="682743" wikidata="Q634318" url="?curid=682743" title="Grigory Landsberg">
<text>Grigory Samuilovich Landsberg (Russian: Григорий Самуилович Ландсберг; 22 January 1890 – 2 February 1957) was a Soviet physicist who worked in the fields of optics and spectroscopy. Together with Leonid Mandelstam he co-discovered inelastic combinational scattering of light, which is known as Raman scattering.

== Vitae ==
Landsberg graduated from the Moscow State University in 1913 and then taught there from 1913 to 1915, 1923–1945, and 1947–1951 (Professor since 1923). From 1934, he simultaneously worked also in the Physical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. From 1951 to 1957 he was a professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.

Landsberg conducted pioneering studies on the vibrational scattering of light in crystals beginning in 1926. In 1928, Landsberg and Mandelstam discovered a phenomenon of &quot;combinational scattering of light&quot; (this phenomenon became known as Raman scattering or the Raman effect independently discovered by C. V. Raman and K. S. Krishnan in liquids). Landsberg discovered the fine structure in Rayleigh scattering. In 1931, he discovered a phenomenon of selective scattering of light.

He laid the foundation for the spectroscopy of organic molecules and the studies on inter- and intra-molecular interactions in the gaseous, liquid and solid phases in the USSR.
He founded a major school on atomic and molecular spectral analysis. He developed techniques for the spectral analysis of metals and alloys (USSR Government Prize, 1941), and for the analysis of complex organic mixtures, including motor fuels. He is the author of the famous course of &quot;Optics&quot;, and editor of the most popular &quot;Elementary Textbook on Physics&quot; (Volumes 1–3, 7th Edition, 1971).

In 1946 he became a full member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He later founded the Commission on Spectroscopy at the academy, which in 1968 was transformed into the Institute for Spectroscopy Russian Academy of Sciences. 
Landsberg was awarded two Orders of Lenin and several medals.

== Discovery of the combinational scattering of light ==

Beginning in 1926, Mandelstam and Landsberg initiated experimental studies on the vibrational scattering of light in crystals at the Moscow State University. Their intention was to prove the theoretical prediction made by Mandelstam in 1918 regarding the fine structure splitting in Rayleigh scattering due to light scattering on thermal acoustic waves. As a result of this research, Landsberg and Mandelstam discovered the effect of the inelastic combinational scattering of light on 21 February 1928 (&quot;combinational&quot; – from the combination of frequencies of photons and molecular vibrations). They presented this fundamental discovery for the first time at a colloquium on 27 April 1928. They published brief reports about this discovery (experimental results with theoretical explanation) in Russian and in German and then published a comprehensive paper in &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot;.

In the same year of 1928, two Indian scientists C. V. Raman and K. S. Krishnan were looking for the &quot;Compton component&quot; of scattered light in liquids and vapors. They found the same combinational scattering of light. Raman stated that &quot;The line spectrum of the new radiation was first seen on 28 February 1928.&quot; Thus, combinational scattering of light was discovered by Mandelstam and Landsberg a week earlier than by Raman and Krishnan. However, the phenomenon became known as the Raman effect because Raman published his results earlier than Landsberg and Mandelstam did. Nonetheless, in Russian-language literature, it is traditionally called &quot;combinational scattering of light&quot;.

<text>Commewijne is a district of Suriname, located on the right bank of the Suriname River. Commewijne&#x27;s capital city is Nieuw Amsterdam. Tamanredjo is another major town, while Meerzorg is the most populated.

The district has a population of 31,420 and an area of 2,353 km2.

One of the most populated of Suriname&#x27;s districts, Commewijne relies primarily on agriculture for its income, with plantations dating back to the first Dutch colonisation of the area in the 17th century. In the 21st century, Meerzorg has been designated as a regional centre, and suburban area for Paramaribo, and is the site of many building projects. Nieuw Amsterdam has been steadily growing as well.

==History==
In 1621, the Dutch West India Company started to explore the Guianas, and traded with the indigenous people. When a force reporting to Francis Willoughby landed on Commewijne, there was already a small Dutch settlement who were trading with the indigenous people, and a group of Jews had arrived in Suriname in 1632. Surinam was conquered in 1667 by Abraham Crijnssen for the Dutch West India Company. Commewijne became the main location for plantations during the 18th century. A monument to the independence of Suriname is located in Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam.

==Forts==

Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam is located in Nieuw Amsterdam. On 10 October 1712, Jacques Cassard captured the plantation Meerzorg for France, and threatened Paramaribo across the Suriname river. To protect Paramaribo and Commewijne from future attacks, Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam was constructed, and opened in 1747.

Several other small colonial forts were constructed. The redoubts Frederiksdorp, Braamspunt, and Leiden were the first towns connected to a telephone line after Paramaribo to Nieuw-Amsterdam in 1888. The scale of the other forts was small, because when August Kappler visited Frederiksdorp in 1854, three soldiers were stationed there.

==Resorts==

Commewijne is divided into 6 resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
* Alkmaar
* Bakkie
* Margaretha
* Meerzorg
* Nieuw Amsterdam
* Tamanredjo

==Villages==
* Alliance
* Ephrata
* Katwijk
* Kronenburg
* Laarwijk
* Mariënburg
* Stolkertsijver

==Nature and tourism==
The Braamspunt Nature Reserve is located in Commewijne, because it is an important nesting ground for the leatherback sea turtles, and the green sea turtles.

The former plantation of Frederiksdorp is located near Johan &amp; Margaretha, and has in 2004 been designated at as a monument.

==Transport==
Commewijne used to be isolated from Paramaribo, In 1931, a ferry opened between Meerzorg en Paramaribo, but to improve access to the eastern part of Suriname, the Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge was opened on 20 May 2000 replacing the ferry. The bridge is part of the East-West Link.

In 2020, plans were announced to build a bridge between Laarwijk and Domburg in order to develop the area, and relieve traffic congestion between Wanica and Commewijne.

==Economy==
The economy is still largely built around agriculture, and the industry in the district are mainly related to agriculture as well. The closure of the sugarcane factory Mariënburg in 1986 caused a regional decline. Meerzorg is becoming a centre for trade. Companies and banks have started to open offices or moved to the town.

<text>The Curragh incident of 20 March 1914, sometimes known as the Curragh mutiny, occurred in the Curragh, County Kildare, Ireland. The Curragh Camp was then the main base for the British Army in Ireland, which at the time still formed part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Ireland was scheduled to receive a measure of devolved government, which included Ulster, later in the year. The incident is important in 20th-century Irish history, and is notable for being one of the few occasions since the English Civil War in which elements of the British military openly intervened in politics. It is widely thought of as a mutiny, though no orders actually given were disobeyed.

With Irish Home Rule due to become law in 1914, the British Cabinet contemplated some kind of military action against the unionist Ulster Volunteers who threatened to rebel against it. Many officers, especially those with Irish Protestant connections, of whom the most prominent was Hubert Gough, threatened to resign or accept dismissal rather than obey orders to conduct military operations against the unionists, and were privately encouraged from London by senior officers including Henry Wilson.

Although the Cabinet issued a document claiming that the issue had been a misunderstanding, Secretary of State for War J. E. B. Seely and Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) Field Marshal Sir John French were forced to resign after amending it to promise that the British Army would not be used against the Ulster loyalists.

The event contributed both to unionist confidence and to the growing Irish nationalist movement, convincing Irish nationalists that they could not expect support from the British Army in Ireland.

==Background==
In early 1912, the Liberal British government of H. H. Asquith had introduced the Third Home Rule Bill for Ireland, which proposed the creation of an autonomous Irish Parliament in Dublin. Unionists had objected to being under the jurisdiction of the proposed Dublin Parliament, and Ulster Unionists founded the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) paramilitary group in 1912, aided by a number of senior retired British officers, to fight if necessary against the British government and/or against a future Irish Home Rule government as proposed by the bill.

In September 1913, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), John French, had expressed his concerns to the government and to the King (who had also asked Asquith for his views) that the British Army, if ordered to act against the UVF, might split, with some serving officers even siding with the Ulster Unionists, given that many shared the same view of preserving and defending a Protestant British Empire and believed Home Rule for mainly Catholic Ireland would threaten it. Major-General Henry Hughes Wilson, Director of Military Operations, was in regular contact with Opposition leaders (including Bonar Law) and with retired officers who supported the Volunteers.

==Paget&#x27;s orders==
To deal with the threat of violence from the UVF should the Home Rule Bill be passed in the British Parliament, Chief of the General Staff (CIGS) Field Marshal Sir John French and Secretary of State for War J. E. B. Seely summoned General Sir Arthur Paget, Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, for talks at the War Office in October 1913. Paget&#x27;s letter (19 October) suggests that he wanted &quot;partial mobilisation&quot; while Seely wrote to the Prime Minister (24 October) about the potential use of General Nevil Macready, who had experience of crowd control during the Tonypandy riots in 1910, and had been consulted by Birrell about the use of troops in the Belfast riots of 1912. In October 1913, Seely sent Macready to report on the police in Belfast and Dublin.

Intelligence reported that the UVF (now 100,000 strong) might be about to seize the ammunition at Carrickfergus Castle. Political negotiations were deadlocked as John Redmond&#x27;s Irish Parliamentary Party was only willing to offer Ulster an opt-out from Home Rule for up to six years (i.e., until after the next general election), whereas the Ulster Unionists, led by Edward Carson, wanted a permanent opt-out. Asquith set up a five-man Cabinet Committee, chaired by Lord Crewe (who soon fell ill), and consisting of John Simon, Augustine Birrell (Chief Secretary for Ireland), Seely, and Winston Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty). Churchill, who spoke at Bradford (14 March) to say that there were &quot;worse things than bloodshed, even on an extended scale&quot; and &quot;Let us go forward together and put these grave matters to the proof&quot;, and Seely appear to have been courting some kind of confrontation with the UVF.

Paget was ordered to prepare to deploy troops to prevent &quot;evil-disposed persons&quot; seizing weapons, and summoned to London for further instructions. Seely obtained French&#x27;s compliance by repeatedly assuring him of the accuracy of intelligence that the UVF might march on Dublin. The plan was to occupy government buildings, to repel any assaults by the UVF and to guard the armouries at Omagh, Enniskillen, Armagh, Dundalk and Carrickfergus to prevent thefts of weapons. Six different contingencies were discussed, including armed resistance to the troops as they moved to protect the arms depots. Seely also promised Paget reinforcements &quot;... to the last man ...&quot; to uphold the law in Ireland. In the event of a railway strike, or other obstacle, Churchill offered transport of forces by the Royal Navy.

The politicians later claimed that at the meeting when Paget arrived in London, they merely gave verbal amplification to orders which he had already received from the War Office, but Asquith later admitted that this was untrue; at the meeting Paget was also told to send troops to Newry (an old, empty barracks with no stores) and Dundalk, both in Irish nationalist areas and so unlikely to be seized by the UVF, but of strategic importance in any move to bring Ulster under military control. It was later suggested (a claim believed by Sir James Fergusson, Charles Fergusson&#x27;s son) that the move to deploy troops may have been a &quot;plot&quot; by Churchill and Seely to goad the loyalists into a rebellion which would then be put down, although this view is not universally held.

On the evening of 18 March, Paget wired Major-General Lovick Friend that the troop movements were to be completed by dawn on Sunday 31 March. Paget was summoned to another meeting on 19 March at which Seely declared that the government was pressing ahead with Home Rule and had no intention of allowing civil war to break out, suggesting that the UVF were to be crushed if they attempted to start one. Prince Louis of Battenberg (First Sea Lord) was also at the meeting, as that day the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered to steam to Lamlash on the Firth of Clyde. The following night Churchill told French that his ships would have Belfast in flames in 24 hours, while other vessels were ready to help deploy troops to Ulster (in case of a strike by loyalist railwaymen). That evening, after Carson had stormed out of a Commons debate and departed for Ulster, where he was expected to declare a provisional government, Asquith, Seely, Churchill, Birrell, Field Marshal French, and General Paget had an emergency meeting at 10 Downing Street where Asquith insisted that extra infantry be sent to defend the artillery at Dundalk, which French wanted to withdraw. Seely claimed that a unionist coup was imminent in Ulster, although no trace of his intelligence survives.

==Resignations==
Paget travelled to Dublin that night in a state of high excitement, having been given no written orders (it is unclear whether this was because the politicians were reluctant to put anything in writing).

The next morning (Friday 20 March), Paget addressed Generals Rolt, Cuthbert, Gough, and Fergusson (GOC 5th Infantry Division), and three staff officers, at his Parkgate Street H.Q. in Dublin. Three different accounts exist (written by Paget, by Fergusson, and by Gough in his memoirs &quot;Soldiering On&quot;), but it is clear that Paget exacerbated the situation. By Gough&#x27;s account, he said that &quot;active operations were to commence against Ulster&quot;. Paget then claimed that he had obtained &quot;concessions&quot; from Seely, namely that officers who lived in Ulster would be permitted to &quot;disappear&quot; for the duration, and that other officers who refused to serve against Ulster would be dismissed rather than being permitted to resign. French, Paget, and Adjutant-General Spencer Ewart had indeed (on 19 March) agreed to exclude officers with &quot;direct family connections&quot; to Ulster, and to dismiss other officers who refused to participate. Paget told Gough, who queried whether &quot;disappear&quot; meant absence with or without leave, and who had a family connection to Ulster but did not live there, that he could expect no mercy from &quot;his old friend at the War Office&quot; (John French). Richard Holmes wrote that in effectively offering his officers an ultimatum, Paget was acting foolishly, as the majority might simply have obeyed if simply ordered north. Paget ended the meeting by ordering his officers to speak to their subordinates and then report back. Fergusson collared Gough and one of the infantry brigadiers, and warned that the Army must hold together at all costs, and that he himself would obey orders. Gough said that he would not, and went off to speak to the officers of the 5th Lancers (one of the regiments under his command) and also sent a telegram to his brother Johnnie, Haig&#x27;s Chief of Staff at Aldershot. Gough did not attend the second meeting in the afternoon, at which Paget confirmed that the purpose of the move was to overawe Ulster rather than fight. No provision was made for enlisted men who had conscientious objections. The deployment orders were headed &quot;&#x27;Duty as ordered – Active Operations in Ulster&quot;, and Gough later suggested that &quot;active operations&quot; sounded as if it were much more than a cautionary protective deployment.

Gough offered the officers under his command at nearby Marlborough Barracks (now McKee Barracks) the choice of resignation rather than fighting against the Ulster Volunteers. The ultimatum was passed on to the rest of Gough&#x27;s 3rd Cavalry Brigade 25 miles away at the Curragh Camp.

On the evening of 20 March, Paget sent a telegram to the War Office in London announcing that almost all the officers of 5th Lancers intended to resign and the same was probably true of 16th Lancers. Seely replied, on behalf of the Army Council, telling Paget to suspend any senior officer who had offered to resign, and ordering Gough and two of his three colonels (the attitude of the third was unclear) to report to the War Office. A second telegram just before midnight confirmed that 57 officers preferred to accept dismissal (it was actually 61 including Gough):

At the date of the incident, 70 officers were serving with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade. The officers were not technically guilty of mutiny, as they had resigned before refusing to carry out a direct order. As all were in Gough&#x27;s brigade, and as they were informed of his reservations about Seely&#x27;s orders, he was portrayed as central to the whole incident.

Chetwode was nominated to take Gough&#x27;s place if necessary. Up to 100 other officers of Irish Command threatened to resign.

==Results==
General Sir Charles Fergusson, then commanding the 5th Division in Ireland, toured units on the morning of Saturday 21 March to ensure their future compliance with government policy. One of his officers said later that

He [Fergusson] reminded us that although we must naturally hold private political views, officially we should not be on the side of any one political party. It was our duty to obey orders, to go wherever we were sent and to comply with instructions of any political party that happened to be in power. There was no sloppy sentiment; it was good stuff straight from the shoulder and just what we wanted.

Paget did the same, but his speech was described by a colonel as &quot;absolutely unconvincing and inconclusive.&quot; However, Paget was able to conduct the precautionary moves planned on 18 and 19 March.

The elderly Field Marshal Roberts, who had recently exchanged &quot;epithets&quot; with French on the telephone over what he saw as French&#x27;s collaboration with the government&#x27;s &quot;dastardly&quot; plans, learned that Paget, in talking of &quot;active operations&quot; and in giving officers a chance to discuss hypothetical orders and threaten to resign, had been acting without authority and left a note for Hubert Gough to this effect. The King wrote to Asquith requesting that he be consulted before any further steps were taken.

Gough, summoned to the War Office, confirmed (Sunday 22 March) that he would have obeyed a direct order to move against Ulster. When he saw the King that evening, French, advised by Haldane (Lord Chancellor) that Paget should not have asked officers about &quot;hypothetical contingencies,&quot; also threatened to resign if Gough were not reinstated. Paget was ordered to report to London, Macready was sent out to Belfast (but without official announcement) while Asquith informed the King that Paget had indeed exceeded his instructions, that only safeguarding of ammunition stores had been intended, that the naval deployment had been cancelled, and that there would be no further troop movement without consulting the King.

Asquith&#x27;s Liberal government backed down, claiming an &quot;honest misunderstanding.&quot; At French&#x27;s suggestion Seely obtained a document from the Cabinet, stating that the Army Council were satisfied that the incident had been a misunderstanding, and that it was &quot;the duty of all soldiers to obey lawful commands.&quot; Seely added two paragraphs, stating that the Government had the right to use &quot;forces of the Crown&quot; in Ireland or elsewhere, but had no intention of using force &quot;to crush opposition to the Home Rule Bill.&quot; It is unclear whether this—amending a Cabinet document without Cabinet approval—was an honest blunder on Seely&#x27;s part or whether he was encouraged to do so and then made a scapegoat. Gough insisted on adding a further paragraph clarifying that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule &quot;on Ulster&quot;, to which French concurred in writing. Wilson, Roberts and French had been leaking information to the press throughout the Incident. Gough promised to keep the 23 March Treaty confidential, but it soon leaked to the press—it appears that both Gough and French leaked it to Gwynne of the &quot;Morning Post&quot;, while Wilson leaked it to Leo Amery and Bonar Law.

The matter was debated in the Commons at length on 23 and 25 March. Asquith (25 March) publicly repudiated the &quot;peccant paragraphs&quot; which had been added to the Cabinet statement, and French, the Adjutant-General Spencer Ewart and Seely had to resign.

About a month later, on 24 April the Ulster Volunteers covertly landed about 24,000 rifles at night in the &quot;Larne gun-running&quot; incident. Its leaders considered that raiding the army&#x27;s Ulster armouries would have lessened the public&#x27;s goodwill towards it in Britain.

Labour and radical opinion was outraged that the Army, apparently happy enough to suppress industrial unrest, had been allowed to prevent the use of force in Ulster.

The event contributed both to unionist confidence and to the growing Irish separatist movement, convincing nationalists that they could not expect support from the British army in Ireland. In turn, this naturally increased nationalist support for its paramilitary force, the Irish Volunteers. While the Home Rule Bill was approved by the House of Commons on 25 May, the growing fear of civil war in Ireland led on to the government considering some form of partition of Ireland in July 1914 by an amending Bill; further discussions at the Buckingham Palace Conference could not solve the arguments about partition. The main Bill received the Royal Assent on 18 September, but was also suspended for the duration of the First World War.

<text>Horatio William Bottomley (23 March 1860 – 26 May 1933) was an English financier, journalist, editor, newspaper proprietor, swindler, and Member of Parliament. He is best known for his editorship of the popular magazine &quot;John Bull&quot;, and for his nationalistic oratory during the First World War. His career came to a sudden end when, in 1922, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years&#x27; imprisonment.

Bottomley spent five years in an orphanage before beginning his career, aged 14, as an errand boy. Subsequent experience as a solicitor&#x27;s clerk gave him a useful knowledge of English law, which he later put to effective use in his court appearances. After working as a shorthand writer and court reporter, at 24 he founded his own publishing company, which launched numerous magazines and papers, including, in 1888, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. He overreached with an ambitious public flotation of his company, which led to his first arraignment on fraud charges in 1893. Despite evidence of malpractice, Bottomley, who defended himself, was acquitted. He subsequently amassed a fortune as a promoter of shares in gold-mining companies.

In 1906 Bottomley entered parliament as the Liberal Party member for Hackney South. In the same year, he founded the popular magazine &quot;John Bull&quot;, which became a platform for Bottomley&#x27;s trenchant populist views. Financial extravagance and mismanagement continued to blight his career, and in 1912 he had to resign from parliament after being declared bankrupt. The outbreak of war in 1914 revived his fortunes; as a journalist and orator, Bottomley became a leading propagandist for the war effort, addressing well over 300 public meetings. His influence was such that it was widely expected that he would enter the War Cabinet, although he received no such offer.

In 1918, having been discharged from bankruptcy, Bottomley re-entered parliament as an Independent member. In the following year, he launched his fraudulent &quot;Victory Bonds&quot; scheme which, when exposed, led to his conviction, imprisonment and expulsion from parliament. Released in 1927, he attempted unsuccessfully to relaunch his business career and eked out a living by lecturing and appearances in music halls. His final years before his death in 1933 were spent in poverty.

== Life ==

=== Family background and childhood ===

Bottomley was born on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter&#x27;s Street, Bethnal Green in London, the second child and only son of William King Bottomley, a tailor&#x27;s cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake. William Bottomley&#x27;s background is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family of well-known radical agitators—her brother George Jacob Holyoake was a founder of the Secularist movement and in later life a leading figure in the growth of Co-operative societies.

Among Holyoake&#x27;s close associates was Charles Bradlaugh, who founded the National Republican League and became a controversial Member of Parliament. A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio&#x27;s biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.

William Bottomley died in 1864 and Elizabeth a year later. Horatio and his elder sister, Florence, were initially looked after by their uncle William Holyoake, an artist living in the London district of Marylebone. After a year they were boarded out to foster-parents, at their uncle George Jacob&#x27;s expense. This arrangement lasted until 1869 when Florence was formally adopted by her foster-family. At this point Holyoake felt unable to continue supporting Horatio financially, and arranged for him to be admitted to Josiah Mason&#x27;s orphanage in Erdington, Birmingham. This was Horatio&#x27;s home for the following five years. Some biographers have emphasised the cruelty and humiliation of his time there; while discipline was certainly harsh, Horatio received a useful basic education, and won prizes for sporting activities. In later life he showed no resentment towards the institution, which he often visited, telling the children that &quot;any success I have achieved in life started at this place.&quot;

In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due to leave the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother&#x27;s sister—who lived in nearby Edgbaston, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham building firm. This arrangement lasted only a few months before Horatio, impatient to be reunited with his sister from whom he had been separated for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.

=== Early career ===

==== First steps ====
Bottomley soon gave up his apprenticeship, and after a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a City firm of solicitors. Here he picked up a working knowledge of English legal procedures and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle&#x27;s encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman&#x27;s College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group&#x27;s publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.

As Bottomley emerged from adolescence to maturity he began to show signs of the characteristics that would be much in evidence in his later life: greed for fleshly pleasures, a thirst for fame, spontaneous generosity, combined with a charm that, according to his biographer Julian Symons, could &quot;tempt the banknotes out of men&#x27;s pockets&quot;.

In 1880 Bottomley married Eliza Norton, the daughter of a debt collector. Bottomley&#x27;s biographers have tended to regard this early, unambitious marriage as a mistake on his part; she was not equipped, intellectually or socially, to help him advance in the world. They had a daughter, Florence, who married firstly American millionaire Jefferson Davis Cohn, and secondly successful South African planter Gilbert Moreland. In the year of his marriage, Bottomley left his job to become a full-time shorthand writer for Walpole&#x27;s, a firm that provided recording and transcription services for the law courts. His competence impressed his employers sufficiently for them, in 1883, to offer him a partnership, and the firm became Walpole and Bottomley.

==== Publishing entrepreneur ====

Bottomley&#x27;s association with Bradlaugh had awakened his interests in publishing and politics, and in 1884 he launched his first entrepreneurial venture, a magazine called the &quot;Hackney Hansard&quot;. This journal recorded the business of Hackney&#x27;s local &quot;parliament&quot;—essentially a debating society that mirrored the proceedings at Westminster. Advertisements from local tradesmen kept the paper mildly profitable. Bottomley produced a sister-paper, the &quot;Battersea Hansard&quot;, covering that borough&#x27;s local parliament, before merging the two into &quot;The Debater&quot;.

In 1885 he formed the Catherine Street Publishing Association and, using borrowed capital, acquired or started several magazines and papers. These included, among others, the &quot;Municipal Review&quot;, a prestigious local government publication; &quot;Youth&quot;, a boys&#x27; paper on which Alfred Harmsworth, the future press magnate Lord Northcliffe, worked as a sub-editor; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. The last-named was set up to rival the &quot;Financial News&quot;, London&#x27;s first specialist business paper, which had been founded in 1884 by Harry Marks, a former sewing-machine salesman. In 1886 Bottomley&#x27;s company acquired its own printing works through a merger with the printing firm of MacRae and Co., and after the absorption of another advertising and printing firm, became MacRae, Curtice and Company.

At the age of 26, Bottomley became the company&#x27;s chairman. His advance in the business world was attracting wider notice, and in 1887 he was invited by the Liberal Party in Hornsey to be their candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He accepted, and although defeated by Henry Stephens, the ink magnate, fought a strong campaign which won him a congratulatory letter from William Gladstone. His business affairs were proceeding less serenely; he quarrelled with his partner Douglas MacRae, and the two decided to separate. Bottomley described the &quot;Quixotic impulse&quot; that led him to let MacRae divide the assets: &quot;He was a printer, and I was a journalist—but he took the papers and left me the printing works&quot;.

==== Hansard Publishing Union ====

Undismayed by the loss of his papers, Bottomley embarked on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company&#x27;s credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company&#x27;s board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London &quot;Evening News&quot;, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North.

This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union&#x27;s capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877 and declared a dividend of eight percent.

The funds for the dividend payment were raised by a debenture of £50,000. By the end of 1890, many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it &quot;Bottomley&#x27;s swindle&quot;. Despite Bottomley&#x27;s outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders petitioned for the company&#x27;s compulsory winding-up. In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least £100,000 from the company, filed a petition for bankruptcy. Under examination by the Official Receiver, he could not say where the money had gone and professed total ignorance of the company&#x27;s book-keeping. After further enquiries, the Board of Trade instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.

The trial began in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley conducted his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for far less than the prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous.

He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.

=== Company promoter, newspaper proprietor, would-be politician ===
The Hansard Union case, far from damaging Bottomley&#x27;s reputation, had left a general impression that he was a financial genius. He avoided the stigma of bankruptcy by arranging a scheme of repayment with his creditors, and swiftly embarked on a new career promoting Western Australian gold mining shares. The discovery of gold in Kalgoorlie and adjoining areas in the early 1890s had created an easily exploitable investment boom; as Bottomley&#x27;s biographer Alan Hyman observes, &quot;A hole in the ground ... could be boosted into a very promising gold-mine, and investors only found that they had backed a loser after the mine had been floated as a public company and they had paid hard cash for their shares&quot;.

By 1897, through skilful exploitation of demand and by frequent reconstruction of failing companies, Bottomley had accumulated a considerable personal fortune. It was, the historian A.J.A. Morris asserts, &quot;a truly amazing success story, the product of reckless audacity, astonishing energy, and extreme good fortune&quot;. Bottomley won plaudits when he announced that he would pay £250,000 to the creditors of the Hansard Union; the bulk of this payment was offered in shares in one or other of his mining promotions.

As his wealth increased, Bottomley adopted an increasingly ostentatious lifestyle. In London he lived in a luxurious apartment in Pall Mall. He took numerous mistresses, whom he visited in several discreet flats in different districts of London. He owned several racehorses, which achieved prestigious victories—the Stewards&#x27; Cup at Goodwood, and the Cesarewitch at Newmarket—but he often lost large sums through unwise bets. Quite early in his rise to wealth he bought a modest property in Upper Dicker, near Eastbourne in East Sussex. He called it &quot;The Dicker&quot;, and over the years extended and developed it into a large country mansion, where he entertained extravagantly.

Bottomley had retained his parliamentary ambitions and in 1890, before the Hansard Union crash, had been adopted as the Liberal candidate for North Islington. According to Symons, when he resigned the candidature on the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, he had the constituency in his pocket. By 1900 his star was again in the ascendant, and he was invited by the Hackney South Liberals to be their candidate in that year&#x27;s general election. He lost by only 280 votes, after a bitterly fought campaign in which Bottomley was described in a newspaper article as a &quot;bare-faced swindler ... [whose] ... place is at the Old Bailey, not at Westminster&quot;. He was subsequently awarded £1,000 libel damages against the writer, Henry Hess.

By the turn of the 19th–20th centuries the boom in speculative shares had abated; some of Bottomley&#x27;s fellow promoters, such as Whitaker Wright, were facing charges of fraud and misrepresentation. Bottomley ceased his operations, and resumed his earlier role of newspaper proprietor. In 1902 he bought a failing London evening paper, &quot;The Sun&quot;, to which he contributed a regular column, &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot;. Another feature was Bottomley&#x27;s employment of celebrity guest editors for special editions; among these were the comedian Dan Leno, the cricketer Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji and the labour leader Ben Tillett.

The paper was not a financial success, and Bottomley sold it in 1904. He had not given up altogether on speculative money-making schemes, and in 1905 began an association with the financier Ernest Hooley. Among their joint enterprises was the promotion of the defunct, dry Basingstoke Canal as a major inland waterway, the &quot;London and South-Western Canal&quot;. Bottomley later made a substantial out-of-court settlement of an action brought by investors who had bought worthless shares in the canal.

=== Parliament, &quot;John Bull&quot;, bankruptcy ===
In the general election of January 1906 Bottomley was again the Liberal candidate for Hackney South. After a vigorous campaign he defeated his Conservative opponent by more than 3,000—the largest Liberal majority in London, he informed the House of Commons in his maiden speech on 20 February 1906. According to Hyman, this speech was received in &quot;chilling silence&quot; by a House that was well aware of Bottomley&#x27;s chequered reputation.

Over the following months and years, he overcame much of the initial hostility, partly by his self-deprecating good humour (as when he described himself as &quot;more or less honourable&quot;) but also because his populist approach to legislation was attractive. He proposed rational reforms of the betting industry and of licensing hours and the introduction of state Old Age Pensions. Extra revenues could be raised, he suggested, by stamp duty on share transfers, taxes on foreign investment, and by appropriating dormant bank balances. He drew the government&#x27;s attention to the long hours worked by domestic servants, and introduced a private bill limiting the working day to eight hours. He privately confided to the journalist Frank Harris that his ambition was to become Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Alongside his parliamentary duties, Bottomley was engaged in launching his biggest and boldest publishing venture, the weekly news magazine &quot;John Bull&quot;, half of the initial capital for which was provided by Hooley. From its first issue on 12 May 1906 &quot;John Bull&quot; adopted a tabloid style that, despite occasional lapses in taste, proved immensely popular. Among its regular features, Bottomley revived his &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; column from &quot;The Sun&quot;, and also adapted that paper&#x27;s slogan: &quot;If you read it in John Bull, it is so&quot;. Bottomley persuaded Julius Elias, managing director of Odhams Limited, to handle the printing, but chaotic financial management meant that Odhams were rarely paid. This situation was resolved when the entire management of the magazine, including the handling of all receipts and payments, was transferred to Elias, leaving Bottomley free to concentrate on editing and journalism. Circulation rose rapidly, and by 1910 had reached half a million copies.

In June 1906 Bottomley announced the John Bull Investment Trust, in which, for a minimum subscription of £10, investors could share &quot;that special and exclusive information which is obtainable only as the result of extensive City experience&quot;. Bottomley&#x27;s earlier City activities were coming under scrutiny, particularly the multiple reconstructions of his now-bankrupt Joint Stock Trust Company. After a long investigation, which Bottomley did all he could to frustrate, in December 1908 he was summoned to appear at the Guildhall Justice Room, before a court of aldermen. As with the Hansard prosecution, the case against Bottomley appeared overwhelming; share issues in the Joint Stock Trust had been repeatedly re-issued, perhaps as many as six times. Once again Bottomley succeeded in obscuring the details and, by the power of his courtroom oratory, persuaded the court that the summons should be dismissed.

One of the prosecuting team at the Guildhall observed that it would be a long time before anyone risked another prosecution against Bottomley: &quot;But he might ... grow careless, and then he will fail&quot;. Despite the adverse publicity, Bottomley was returned by the electors of Hackney South at each of the two 1910 general elections; his tactics included recruiting men in boots tipped and heeled with iron, who marched outside his opponent&#x27;s meetings and rendered the speeches inaudible. In June 1910 he founded the John Bull League, with a mission to promote &quot;commonsense business methods&quot; into government; readers of the magazine could join the League for a shilling (5p) a year. Although still nominally a Liberal, Bottomley had become a trenchant critic of his party, and often aligned himself with the Conservative opposition in attacking Asquith&#x27;s government.

Bottomley&#x27;s parliamentary ambitions were suddenly halted in 1912 when he was successfully sued for £49,000 by one of his Joint Stock Trust victims. Unable to pay, and with massive debts, he was bankrupted with liabilities totalling £233,000. Since bankrupts are ineligible to sit in the House of Commons, he had to resign his seat; after his departure, the future Lord Chancellor, F. E. Smith, wrote that &quot;[h]is absence from the House of Commons has impoverished the public stock of gaiety, of cleverness, of common sense&quot;. Before his bankruptcy, Bottomley had ensured that his main assets were legally owned by relatives or nominees, and was thus able to continue his extravagant lifestyle. &quot;John Bull&quot; remained an ample source of funds, and Bottomley boasted that although nominally bankrupt, &quot;I never had a better time in my life—plenty of money and everything else I want as well&quot;.

=== Sweepstakes and lotteries ===
After leaving the House of Commons, Bottomley denounced Parliament in the pages of &quot;John Bull&quot; as a &quot;musty, rusty, corrupt system&quot; that urgently needed replacement. Through his newly formed Business League he addressed large crowds as he called for government run by businessmen not politicians. As always, Bottomley&#x27;s lifestyle required fresh sources of income, and in 1912 &quot;John Bull&quot; began to organise competitions for cash prizes. Bottomley successfully sued the secretary of the Anti-Gambling League for suggesting that many of the prizewinners were &quot;John Bull&quot; nominees or employees, but received only a farthing in damages. These competitions helped to raise the magazine&#x27;s circulation to 1.5 million.

In 1913 Bottomley met a Birmingham businessman, Reuben Bigland, and together they began running large-scale sweepstakes and lotteries, operated from Switzerland to circumvent English law. Again doubts arose about the genuineness of declared winners; the winner of the £25,000 sweepstake for the 1914 Derby proved on enquiry to be the sister-in-law of one of Bottomley&#x27;s close associates. Bottomley insisted this was a coincidence; years later, it was revealed that all but £250 of the prize had been paid into a bank account controlled by Bottomley.

=== First World War: orator and propagandist ===

Bottomley initially misread the international crisis that developed during the summer of 1914. After the murder of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June in Sarajevo, allegedly with Serbian complicity, &quot;John Bull&quot; described Serbia as &quot;a hotbed of cold-blooded conspiracy and subterfuge&quot;, and called for it to be wiped from the map of Europe. When Britain declared war on the Central Powers on 4 August, Bottomley quickly reversed his position, and within a fortnight was demanding the elimination of Germany. &quot;John Bull&quot; campaigned relentlessly against the &quot;Germhuns&quot;, and against British citizens carrying German-sounding surnames—the danger of &quot;the enemy within&quot; was a persistent Bottomley theme.

On 14 September 1914 he addressed a large crowd at the London Opera House, the first of many mass meetings at which he deployed his trademark phrase, &quot;the Prince of Peace, (pointing to the Star of Bethlehem) that leads us on to God&quot;—words which according to Symons moved many hearts. At the &quot;Great War Rally&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall on 14 January 1915, Bottomley was fully in tune with the national temper when he proclaimed: &quot;We are fighting all that is worst in the world, the product of a debased civilisation&quot;.

During the war, in his self-appointed role as spokesman for the &quot;man in the street&quot;, Bottomley addressed more than 300 public meetings, in all parts of the country. For recruitment rallies he provided his services free; for others, he took a percentage of the takings. His influence was enormous; the writer D. H. Lawrence, who detested Bottomley, thought that he represented the national spirit and that he might become prime minister.

In March 1915 Bottomley began a regular weekly column for the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;. On 4 May, after the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot;, he used this column to label the Germans as &quot;unnatural freaks&quot;, and called for their extermination. Britain&#x27;s war effort, he maintained, was being hampered by squeamish politicians; he reserved particular venom for the Labour Party leaders, Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald, who opposed the war, and demanded they be tried for high treason. Macdonald&#x27;s riposte—to label Bottomley &quot;a man of doubtful parentage who had lived all his life on the threshold of jail&quot;—backfired when the latter published Macdonald&#x27;s birth certificate which showed that the Labour leader was himself illegitimate. Bottomley also criticized the neutrality policy of the United States, arguing the USA was using the war to increase its economic power at the expense of the European powers. Bottomley launched a series of attacks on President Woodrow Wilson that lasted until the US entered the war in 1917.

Although the government was wary of Bottomley it was prepared to make use of his influence and popularity. In April 1915 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, asked him to speak to shipworkers on the River Clyde, who were threatening industrial action. After Bottomley&#x27;s intervention the strike was averted. In 1917 he visited the front in France, where, after dining with Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, he was a considerable success with the troops; his later visit to the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow was a similar success. He hoped that these morale-boosting activities would lead to a formal government position, but although from time to time there were rumours of a Cabinet post, no appointment was announced. In the later stages of the war Bottomley was a regular critic of the National War Aims Committee (NWAC), a cross-party parliamentary body formed in 1917 to revitalise Britain&#x27;s commitment to victory and to underline the justice of its cause. Bottomley described the committee as &quot;a dodge for doctoring public opinion&quot;, and in January 1918 told Lloyd George, who had become prime minister in December 1916, that NWAC had failed in its purpose and should be replaced by a Director of Propaganda—but to no avail.

In 1917, &quot;The Royal Magazine&quot; published Bottomley&#x27;s article &quot;Why Not a Women&#x27;s Parliament?&quot;, suggested as a form of compromise with what he termed the &quot;Suffragette Problem&quot;. He suggested that the war would guarantee that &quot;things will never be the same again&quot; and the status of women be profoundly changed.

=== Postwar career ===

==== Parliament again ====
Although in 1912 Bottomley had expressed contempt for parliament, he privately hankered to return. When the war ended in November 1918 and a general election was announced, he knew that to be a candidate in that election he needed a discharge from his bankruptcy. A payment of £34,000 in cash and bonds, and some hasty reorganisation of outstanding debts, was sufficient for an acquiescent Official Receiver to grant the discharge just in time for Bottomley to hand in his nomination papers in Hackney South. In the general election on 14 December 1918 he stood as an Independent, under the slogan &quot;Bottomley, Brains and Business&quot;, and achieved a massive victory, with almost 80 per cent of the votes cast. &quot;I am now prepared to proceed to Westminster to run the show&quot;, he informed a local newspaper. He would be, he said, the &quot;unofficial prime minister ... watching the government&#x27;s every move&quot; to ensure that it acted in the interests of &quot;our soldiers, sailors and citizens&quot;.

The 1918 parliament was dominated by Lloyd George&#x27;s Liberal–Conservative coalition, which faced a fragmented and unorganised opposition. In May 1919 Bottomley announced the formation of his &quot;People&#x27;s League&quot;, which he hoped would develop into a fully fledged political party with a programme opposing both organised labour and organised capital. No mass movement emerged, but Bottomley joined with other Independent MPs to form the Independent Parliamentary Group, with a distinct policy stance including the enforcement of war reparations, the superiority of Britain over the League of Nations, exclusion of undesirable aliens, and &quot;the introduction of business principles into government&quot;. The group was reinforced through by-election victories of other Independents—including Charles Frederick Palmer, &quot;John Bull&quot;″s deputy editor, until his premature death in October 1920.

Bottomley was, at least for a year or so, a diligent parliamentarian who spoke on a range of issues, and from time to time teased the government as when, during the Irish Troubles, he asked whether, &quot;in view of the breakdown of British rule in Ireland, the government will approach America with a view to her accepting the mandate for the government of that country&quot;. On other occasions he helped the government, as when in January 1919, he was called upon in his role of &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Friend&quot; to help pacify troops in Folkestone and Calais who were in a state of mutiny over delays in their demobilisation.

==== Downfall ====

In July 1919 Bottomley announced his &quot;Victory Bonds Club&quot;, based on the government&#x27;s latest issue of Victory Bonds. Normally, these bonds cost £5; in Bottomley&#x27;s club, subscribers bought units for a minimum payment of £1, and participated in an annual draw for prizes—up to £20,000, he said—funded from accrued interest. Contrary to Bottomley&#x27;s public statements, not all the money subscribed was used to buy bonds. He had ambitions to become a press baron, to rival such as the Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook.

In October 1919 he used War Bonds funds to buy two obscure newspapers, the &quot;National News&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Evening Telegram&quot;. The papers were not financially successful, and in 1921 Bottomley closed the &quot;Telegram&quot; and changed the name of the &quot;National News&quot; to &quot;Sunday Illustrated&quot;. To bolster its fortunes, he transferred his &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; column to the &quot;Illustrated&quot;, and mounted an expensive promotional campaign, but with little benefit. The paper languished, while Bottomley lost the large income and readership that went with the &quot;Pictorial&quot;. His fortunes declined further when, in 1920, Odhams revoked the pre-war partnership agreement and took full control of &quot;John Bull&quot;. Bottomley was made editor for life, but a year later Odhams terminated this arrangement with a final pay-off of £25,000, which ended Bottomley&#x27;s connection with the paper.

Meanwhile, dogged by poor administration and inadequate accounting, the Victory Bonds Club was sliding into chaos. Public unease grew, and soon hundreds of subscribers were demanding their money back—slipshod record-keeping meant that some were repaid several times over. Bottomley&#x27;s position worsened when he fell out with Bigland, after refusing to finance his former associate&#x27;s scheme for turning water into petrol. The two had quarrelled during the war, when Bigland had attacked Bottomley in print. They had later reconciled, but after their second dispute Bigland turned vengeful. In September 1921 he published a leaflet describing the War Bond Club as Bottomley&#x27;s &quot;latest and greatest swindle&quot;. Against the advice of his lawyers, Bottomley sued for criminal libel, and brought other charges against Bigland of blackmail and extortion. The preliminary hearing, at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court in October 1921, at which Bottomley&#x27;s methods were revealed, proved disastrous to his credibility. Nevertheless, Bigland was committed for trial at the Old Bailey on the libel charge, and to Shropshire Assizes on charges of attempted extortion.

The libel trial began on 23 January 1922; to prevent further damaging disclosures in court, Bottomley&#x27;s lawyers offered no evidence, and Bigland was discharged. The extortion case went ahead in Shrewsbury on 18 February 1922, at the end of which it took the jury only three minutes to find Bigland not guilty. Bottomley, himself now under police investigation, was ordered to pay the costs of the trial. A few days afterwards, he was summoned to appear at Bow Street, on charges of fraudulent conversion of Victory Bond Club funds. After a brief hearing he was committed for trial at the Old Bailey.

=== Final years ===

Bottomley&#x27;s trial began on 19 May 1922, before Mr Justice Salter. As the case was beginning, Bottomley secured the agreement of the prosecuting counsel, Travers Humphreys, to a 15-minute adjournment each day so that he, Bottomley, could drink a pint of champagne, ostensibly for medicinal purposes. He faced 24 fraud charges, involving amounts totalling £170,000. The prosecution produced evidence that he had regularly used Victory Bonds Club funds to finance business ventures, private debts and his expensive lifestyle.

Bottomley, who defended himself, claimed that his legitimate expenses in connection with the club, and repayments made to Victory Bonds Club members, exceeded total receipts by at least £50,000: &quot;I swear I have never made a penny out of it. I swear before God that I have never fraudulently converted a penny of the Club&#x27;s money&quot;. The weight of evidence suggested otherwise; Salter&#x27;s summing up, described by a biographer as &quot;masterly; lucid and concise, yet complete&quot;, went heavily against Bottomley, and the jury required only 28 minutes to convict him on all but one of the charges. He was sentenced to seven years&#x27; penal servitude. Humphreys commented later: &quot;It was not I that floored him, but Drink&quot;.

After the dismissal of his appeal in July, Bottomley was expelled from the House of Commons. The Leader of the House, Sir Austen Chamberlain, read out a letter in which Bottomley insisted that, however unorthodox his methods, he had not been guilty of conscious fraud; he accepted that his predicament was entirely his own fault. Chamberlain then moved Bottomley&#x27;s expulsion, which was carried without dissent. One member expressed regret, &quot;remembering the remarkable position which he [had] occupied in the country&quot;. Bottomley spent the first year of his sentence in Wormwood Scrubs where he sewed mailbags, and the remainder in Maidstone Prison where, although conditions were squalid, he was given lighter work. He was released on 29 July 1927, after serving just over five years, and returned to The Dicker, still his family home, owned at the time of his bankruptcy by his son-in-law, Jefferson Cohn.

Although now 67 years old and in indifferent health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital to start a new magazine, &quot;John Blunt&quot;, as a rival to &quot;John Bull&quot;, but the new venture lasted little more than a year before closing, having lost money from the start. In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley&#x27;s former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn (who owned it) evicted him from The Dicker. For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years of riches, had vainly tried to promote to stardom.

Bottomley&#x27;s last public venture was an engagement at the Windmill Theatre in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience. Following a health breakdown, he lived with Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness.

==Death==
Bottomley died at the Middlesex Hospital on 26 May 1933 at the age of 73, and his body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium a few days later. A large crowd heard the Reverend Basil Bourchier express the hope that &quot;no one here today will forget what Mr Bottomley did to revive the spirits of our men at the Front&quot;. Four years later, in accordance with Bottomley&#x27;s wishes, Primrose scattered his ashes on the Sussex Downs.

== Appraisal ==
Bottomley&#x27;s obituaries dwelt on the common theme of wasted talent: a man of brilliant natural abilities, destroyed by greed and vanity. &quot;He had personal magnetism, eloquence, and the power to convince&quot;, wrote his &quot;Daily Mail&quot; obituarist. &quot;He might have been a leader at the Bar, a captain of industry, a great journalist. He might have been almost anything&quot;. &quot;The Straits Times&quot; of Singapore thought that Bottomley could have rivalled Lloyd George as a national leader: &quot;Though he deserved his fate, the news of his passing will awaken the many regrets for the good which he did when he was Bottomley the reformer and crusader and the champion of the bottom dog&quot;. A later historian, Maurice Cowling, pays tribute to Bottomley&#x27;s capacity and industry, and to his forceful campaigns in support of liberty. In his sketch for the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Morris delivers a different judgement: &quot;[H]e claimed to serve the interests of others, but sought only his own gratification&quot;.

Among Bottomley&#x27;s principal biographers, Hyman suggests that his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of wealth in the 1890s. &quot;Success went to his head and he started spending money like a drunken sailor and could never break the habit.&quot; It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison as long as he did. G. R. Searle speculates that Bottomley was protected from prosecution because of his knowledge of wider scandals in the government, particularly after Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition assumed power in 1916. Symons acknowledges Bottomley&#x27;s &quot;wonderfully rich public personality&quot; but suggests that there was no substance behind the presentation: throughout his adult life, Bottomley was &quot;more a series of public attitudes than a person&quot;. Matthew Engel in &quot;The Guardian&quot; notes his ability to charm the public even while swindling them; one victim, cheated of £40,000, apparently insisted: &quot;I am not sorry I lent him the money, and I would do it again&quot;. If London had had a mayor in those days, says Engel, Bottomley would have won in a landslide.

==Cultural depictions==

<doc id="682753" wikidata="Q1001620" url="?curid=682753" title="Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium">
<text>The Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium is an annual non-championship pre-season NASCAR Cup Series exhibition event held in February before the season-opening Daytona 500. The event was held each year at Daytona International Speedway from the race&#x27;s inception in 1979 until 2021, after which it was moved to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 2022 until 2024, when it was announced the Clash would be moved to Bowman Gray Stadium in 2025. Previously at Daytona, the race, along with the ARCA Menards Series&#x27; season-opening Hard Rock Bet 200, served as the kickoff events for Daytona Speedweeks. The event is one of two non-points races on the Cup Series schedule, the other being the NASCAR All-Star Race.

The event has been sponsored by Anheuser-Busch (which owns the Busch Beer and Budweiser brands) for most of its history. In 2013, Anheuser-Busch moved their Daytona Speedweeks race sponsorship to the Duel races after the departure of longtime Duel title sponsor Gatorade. Cup Series title sponsor Sprint became the title sponsor for this race, which was renamed from &quot;The Shootout&quot; to &quot;The Unlimited&quot; (to promote Sprint&#x27;s cell phone unlimited plan). When Sprint left NASCAR after the 2016 season, Advance Auto Parts became the title sponsor in 2017 and the event was renamed to its original name of &quot;The Clash&quot;. Advanced Auto Parts did not return as the title sponsor in 2020, which opened the door for Anheuser-Busch (which dropped its sponsorship of the Duel races in 2016) returned for a second stint as the title sponsor, and the Busch Clash name was brought back.

After being held on the Daytona oval for its entire history, the event was moved to the Daytona Road Course in 2021 as a result of logistics issues relating to both Super Bowl LV and the planned launch of the seventh-generation chassis (which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The following year, the event was moved out of Daytona International Speedway for the first time in its history, where it was held inside of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as part of launching the seventh-generation chassis. It was NASCAR&#x27;s first race inside a sports stadium since a 1956 race at Soldier Field. The 2022 race also marked the first year that it was not an invitation-only event. For 2025, the event was moved to the Bowman Gray Stadium.

==Background and history==
The event was first known as the Busch Clash and was the brain child of Monty Roberts. Roberts was the brand manager of the newly formed Busch Beer (formerly &quot;Busch Bavarian Beer&quot;) and the race was seen as a way to promote the new brand. Roberts had been successful introducing Mercury into racing while working at Ford, and had also been a part of Ontario Motor Speedway. His experiences led him to believe that racing fans were loyal brand followers. The initial format was set up as a 50-mile sprint race, with no pit stops, with a field consisting of the previous season&#x27;s pole position winners. Inviting the fastest drivers from the previous season headlined the event as the &quot;fastest race&quot; of the season. The race established an incentive for drivers to earn pole positions during the NASCAR season, which up to that time, still offered relatively tiny cash prizes. Likewise, at no time have pole winners earned bonus championship points.

The event was also seen as a way to expand the Speedweeks activities leading up to the Daytona 500. Previously, the weekend before the Daytona 500 featured only minor support events, and the Winston Cup competitors ordinarily would not have taken to the track until Wednesday. The Busch Clash allowed the Winston Cup regulars to kick off the week live on CBS.

The 1987 race, won by Bill Elliott, was completed at an average speed of 197.802 mph. It stands as the fastest sanctioned race in the history of NASCAR (though it was not an official points-paying event).

The 2013 race (renamed the Sprint Unlimited at Daytona) introduced a new format incorporating the results of fan voting into certain aspects of the race.

In 2017, the race was renamed the Advance Auto Parts Clash after Advance Auto Parts signed a multi-year deal to sponsor the event. The 2017 race was delayed to Sunday due to persistent rain, marking the first time the race has been run during the day since 2006.

In 2020, Busch Beer returned to assume naming rights for the race, once again dubbing it the Busch Clash.

In 2021, the race was run on the road course layout, originally intended as a temporary effort in order to have teams use a sixth-generation chassis when the seventh-generation chassis was to have debuted at the Daytona 500 that year. Teams would not have had enough seventh-generation cars available for the Daytona 500, so NASCAR intended to use the sixth-generation road course car (which can be repurposed into an Xfinity Series chassis) at Daytona for cost savings.

Originally, it was planned that the 2022 Clash would return to a standard schedule (the 2021 Speedweeks schedule was shortened because of Super Bowl LV in nearby Tampa), taking place with sixth-generation cars on the road course. That changed when the -22 NFL year moved Super Bowl LVI back a week and into the traditional Speedweeks date after the 2022 Daytona 500 date was announced. NASCAR then moved the renamed Busch Light Clash to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, meaning the event would be held away from Daytona for the first time, and during the NFL&#x27;s off-week between the conference championship games and Super Bowl LVI, which was held in nearby Inglewood for the first time. In June 2022, NASCAR announced that the Clash at the Coliseum would return for 2023 and in September 2023, NASCAR announced again that the Clash at the Coliseum would return for 2024. The 2024 Clash was bumped up from the traditional Sunday race and moved to Saturday due to weather projections, thus making it general admission.

==Race format==
===1979–1990===
The race consisted of a single twenty-lap (50-mile) green flag sprint with no pit stops required. Caution flag laps would not count. A development series race, the Automobile Racing Club of America series, usually was featured as part of the event.

===1991–1997===
The race was broken into two ten-lap, green flag segments. The field was then inverted for the second ten-lap segment. Prize money was awarded for both segments for all positions. The race was broken up into two segments mainly because it had been lacking competitiveness since restrictor plates were introduced in 1988. The inversion rule added some needed excitement to the event, but its popularity continued to wane. Again, the Clash was the support race for paying fans, as the ARCA 200 was usually held after the Clash.

===1998–2000===
The event was renamed the Bud Shootout, and consisted of two 25-lap (62.5-mile) races, the Bud Shootout Qualifier at 11 am, and the Bud Shootout itself at 12 pm. One two-tire pit stop was required for each race. The winner of the qualifier advanced to the main event.

===2001–2002===
The event was renamed the Budweiser Shootout and expanded to a new distance, 70 laps (175 miles). Caution laps would be counted, but the finish had to be under green, with the Truck Series green-white-checker rule used if necessary. A minimum of one two-tire green flag pit stop was required. The Bud Shootout Qualifier was discontinued because second round qualifying for Cup races had been eliminated.

===2003–2008===
The race was broken up into two segments: a 20-lap segment, followed by a ten-minute intermission, concluding with a 50-lap second segment. While a pit stop was no longer required by rule, a reduction in fuel cell size (from 22 gallons to 13.5 gallons) made a fuel stop necessary. (In 2007, fuel cells were expanded to 18.5 gallons.) Many drivers also changed two tires during their fuel stop, as the time required to fuel the car allowed for a two-tire change without additional delay.

===2009–2012===
The first segment was expanded to 25 laps, followed by the 50-lap second segment. The total race distance was 75 laps (187.5 miles).

===2013–2015===
The race was divided into three segments (30 laps, 25 laps, 20-laps), with online fan voting deciding certain aspects of the race specifics (lengths of the segments, requirements for mandatory pit stops, number of drivers eliminated, etc.) The total race distance was 75 laps (187.5 miles). For 2013, the vote resulted in a mandatory four-tire pit stop, and no cars were eliminated. For 2014, voting set the starting lineup per final practice speeds and required mandatory pit stops after the second segment.

===2016–2020===
The race still kept its 75-lap distance, and returned to the 2003 format with one exception; the first segment was now 25 laps instead of 20 laps. The race originally consisted of a 20-lap/50-mile, &quot;all-out sprint&quot; for the previous season&#x27;s pole position winners (considered the &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;fastest drivers on the circuit&quot;) and added previous Daytona Pole Award winners, former Clash race winners, former Daytona 500 pole winners, and drivers who qualified for the preceding season&#x27;s NASCAR playoffs. Any driver in the field had to have competed full-time in the Cup Series in 2016.

===2021===
The race was planned with the seventh-generation car changeover happening at the Daytona 500, which was postponed a year by supply chain and development issues from the pandemic lockdowns that severely altered the previous season. As a result, the race was moved to the road course using the previous sixth-generation cars to save teams resources and ensure the single-source new chassis (which teams did not have enough at the time) would not be potentially destroyed in crashes during the event after the previous season&#x27;s Clash ended with incidents that few cars were remaining, to curb the blocking that created massive crashes. A 200 kilometer (126.35 miles to be exact) race, the segments were 15 and 20 laps, respectively.

===2022–2024===
On September 14, 2021, NASCAR announced that the Busch Clash would move to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. On November 9, 2021, the format for the 2022 Clash was announced:

On December 21, 2022, NASCAR made further changes to the Busch Clash by expanding transfer positions from four to five cars in each heat, thereby expanding the field from 23 to 27 cars.

* The event was open for all teams and drivers for the first time in its history.
* A total of 350 laps in seven races.
* The 36 charter teams and up to four open teams participated in qualifying. Should more than 40 teams enter the race, the four fastest times in qualifying determine who advances to the heat races.
* Based on lap times, cars were put in one of four heat races of 25 laps each.
* The top four (2022) or five (2023) drivers in each 25-lap heat advanced to the feature.
* All non-advancing drivers in the 25-lap heats were assigned to one of two 50-lap &quot;Last Chance Qualifiers (LCQs).&quot;
* The top three drivers in each 50-lap LCQ formed the 17th-21st (2022) or 21st-26th (2023) starting positions in the feature, with the top three in the 1st LCQ lining up in the odd-numbered positions and the top 3 in the 2nd LCQ in the even-numbered positions. 
* The highest driver in the previous year&#x27;s Cup Series points standings not already advanced advanced to the feature in the last position (27th).
* The feature is 150 laps (green flag only in 2023).

===2025–present===
On August 17, 2024, it was announced that the Busch Clash would move to Bowman Gray Stadium on February 2, 2025.

On January 21, 2025, NASCAR announced changes to the Busch Clash, increasing the number of transfer positions from five cars per heat. As a result, the field size was adjusted from 27 cars back to 23 cars.

Changes for 2025 included the following:
* Heat Races – Four heat races of 25 laps each with only green flag laps counted. If the safety car is called in the final lap, the race is over. The top five from each heat race advance through to The Clash.
* B Main – One &quot;B Main&quot; style race of 75 green flag laps is used. Starting position determined by where they finished in their respective heat races. The LCQ race is 75 green flag laps, and would end if the safety car is called in the final lap. The top two finishers in the LCQ will transfer to The Clash. The provisional will continue to be used for the highest in points.
* A Main– The main event is now 200 green laps, with a break after 100 laps. If the safety car happens during Lap 200, the race will be extended.

==Race eligibility==
* 1979–2008: Pole position winners from the previous season clinched automatic berths. From 1979 to 2000, qualifying consisted of two rounds, one driver based on the second round qualifying format was automatically admitted.
** 1979–1997, 2001: The drivers that were the fastest qualifiers for the previous year&#x27;s races&#x27; during Busch second round qualifying (except for those who had won awards for first round qualifying had their names omitted) were eligible for one wild card spot. The wild card driver was selected by blind draw during the week of the January media tour (until 1981), or at NASCAR&#x27;s end of season prizegiving banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria in December (1982-1997).
** 1995–96: The winner of the most pole positions in the secondary NASCAR Busch Series won an entry into the Busch Clash as a wild card, driving a Busch-sponsored car. David Green won the right both times.
** 1998–2000: Drivers eligible from second round qualifying participated in the Bud Shootout Qualifier, with the winner advancing to the main event Bud Shootout.
* 2002–08: All former winners of the event not already qualified received automatic berths.
* 2009: With the 2008 season being the first where Coors replaced Anheuser-Busch as the series&#x27; pole award sponsor, pole winners were no longer part of qualifying formats. The field consists of 28 cars. The top six teams from each manufacturer (Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge, and Toyota) based on owners&#x27; points from the previous season clinch berths, for a total of 24 cars. Unlike previous formats, the &quot;entry&quot; (team) receives the berth, not the &quot;driver&quot;. In addition, each of the four manufacturers receive one &quot;wild card&quot; berth for a car/driver not already qualified, to bring the grand total to 28 cars. The other four &quot;entries&quot; were for previous champions and past Shootout winners. This system was discarded after only one year as it was largely unpopular.
* 2010–11: A new qualifying format was introduced, which expanded the field, with no size limitations:
**The 12 drivers from the previous season&#x27;s NASCAR Playoffs
**Previous Budweiser Shootout winners
**Previous points-paying race winners at Daytona (Daytona 500 or Coke Zero 400)
**Previous Sprint Cup champions
**The last 10 Rookies of year (in 2010, it was only the reigning rookie of the year)
* 2012: The field was once again expanded. Automatic bids went to the top 25 in series points (every driver from defending series champion Tony Stewart through 25th place Brian Vickers), as well as any Daytona race winner who was not otherwise qualified and who competed in at least one race in 2011 (which enabled Bill Elliott, Geoff Bodine, Derrike Cope, Michael Waltrip, Jamie McMurray, Trevor Bayne, Terry Labonte, and Ken Schrader to make the race if they decide to run).
* 2013–14: With Sprint now taking over sponsorship of the race, the Speedway reverted to the 2002-08 format where all drivers who won pole positions via time trials (does not include winners of practice one, should qualifying not be held because of inclement weather) and previous winners of the event that have attempted to qualify for any of the 36 points races in the previous season are eligible. The driver does not have to win the then-Coors Light Pole Award (which could happen if the driver does not have a beer sticker) in order to claim an Unlimited seat, just set the fastest time in pole qualifying. The beer sticker mandate was also eliminated by the track.
* 2015–16: Eligibility was once again changed, with a minimum of 25 eligible entries. In addition to the traditional pole winners and former race winners, additional eligibility was added. These additional slots were awarded to: 
**The 16 drivers who made the Playoffs.
**Previous Daytona 500 front row starters (both inside and outside polesitters) if they did not win a pole position at any of the other 35 races during the previous season
**To ensure the field was 25 cars, if there were fewer than 25 drivers eligible, any remaining spots are filled by the highest drivers in the previous season&#x27;s final point standings to not be automatically entered into the Unlimited on any of the other qualifications
* 2017–18: The minimum number of cars rule and the outside pole winners for the Daytona 500 rule were removed. The field consisted of pole winners, former Clash race winners, former Daytona 500 pole winners, and drivers who qualified for the NASCAR Playoffs. Similar to the 2009 format based on teams, NASCAR gave a special exemption for rookie Daniel Suarez since Joe Gibbs Racing already had a car prepared for Carl Edwards who surprisingly retired just a month before the race.
* 2019–20: Daytona 500 champions were also eligible to participate in the Clash. In addition, drivers in categories other than the traditional pole winners from the previous season (former Clash, Daytona 500 pole, and race winners, in addition to playoff drivers) must have participated full-time in the previous season. 
* 2021: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 where only five races (Daytona 500, Auto Club, and the first races at Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Charlotte) had pole qualifying, the eligibility requirements for the 2021 Clash were changed to the following:
**Busch Pole Award winners from the five races where it was held.
**Busch Clash winners who raced full-time in the previous season
**Daytona 500 winners who raced full-time in the previous season
**Daytona 500 Busch Pole Award winners who raced full-time in the previous season
**Playoff drivers of the previous season
**Race winners of the previous season
**Stage winners of the previous season
* 2022–present: All 36 chartered teams participate, and non-chartered teams may attempt to qualify for one of four positions for heat races, for one of 22 (2022) or 26 (2023) positions from heat races. The highest-ranked driver in final points standings that did not qualify will also advance to the feature.

==Race history==
* 1979: The race debuted on Sunday, broadcast live on CBS. Pole position qualifying for the Daytona 500 would start Sunday at 10 am, followed by the ARCA 200. The Busch Clash would be held after the ARCA race at 3 pm.
* 1980: Heavy winds during Daytona 500 pole qualifying delayed the proceedings and the ARCA 200 began 90 minutes later than scheduled. As 3 pm approached, the ARCA race was red flagged and halted so that the Busch Clash could be held as scheduled and be shown on live television. After the Clash was finished, the ARCA race resumed.
* 1981: Morning rain washed out Daytona 500 pole qualifying, which was rescheduled for the following day. After the track dried Sunday, the ARCA race began at 2:30 pm. The Busch Clash, scheduled for 3 pm, was held following the delayed ARCA race.
* 1983: Rain washed out all scheduled activities for Sunday. The Busch Clash was rescheduled and run the following day, Monday.
* 1984: Ricky Rudd was spun off the track at turn four at a very high speed, resulting in a blowover, then a series of violent flips. Ricky suffered a concussion, and his eyes were so swollen that he had to tape them open so he could race in that Thursday&#x27;s UNO Twin 125 and subsequent races. Rudd missed the inside wall during his wreck; during the second Twin 125, Randy Lajoie was not as fortunate.
* 1985: Track officials reorganized the schedule for track activities for the weekend. Daytona 500 pole qualifying was moved from Sunday to Saturday, and the Busch Clash was moved from 3 pm to 12 pm on Sunday. The ARCA 200 was then held after the Busch Clash rather than before.
* 1992: For one year, Daytona 500 pole qualifying and the Busch Clash swapped days. The Busch Clash was held Saturday, and qualifying was held Sunday. This move was made at the request of CBS, who wanted the additional time on Sunday for their coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics.
* 1995: Morning rain delayed the start by 30 minutes.
* 2001: FOX broadcasts the race for the first time. It also marked the first race televised on Fox. The start time was shifted to 2 pm on Sundays.
* 2002: TNT broadcast the race for the first time.
* 2003: The race was run at night for the first time.
* 2004: A crash at the final lap resulted in controversy. A 2003 incident at Loudon involving Dale Jarrett and Casey Mears had resulted in the banning of racing back to the caution. In this case, NASCAR did not wave the caution at the end of the race despite a crash involving Ryan Newman and Jamie McMurray, and allow the race to run to the finish, creating a potentially dangerous situation. Ironically, Dale Jarrett won the race.
* 2005: The ARCA race was stopped for 45 minutes because of repairs to the catchfencing, and was stopped 15 laps short in order to prepare for the Budweiser Shootout.
* 2006: The event was postponed from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon due to rain. This was also the first shootout to feature the green-white-checkered finish. Denny Hamlin became the first rookie to win the event in 2006 in his #11 car.
* 2007: Tony Stewart won the race for the third time driving his No. 20 car. It was the second win in a row for Joe Gibbs Racing because Denny Hamlin won in 2006.
* 2008: Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the race for the second time, and won in his first start with Hendrick Motorsports. He also made the record of leading the most laps, 47, during the shootout.
* 2009: Kevin Harvick, won the race for the first time on a last-lap pass reminiscent of his 2007 Daytona 500 last-lap pass on Mark Martin. This time however Harvick passed Jamie McMurray in Turn 3 for the win as an accident would occur behind Harvick, also the same scenario happened in the 500 for Harvick.
* 2010: All Daytona 500 qualifying weekend activity was moved to Saturday, as not to conflict with Super Bowl XLIV. Daytona 500 qualifying started at 12 noon, then the ARCA Lucas Oil Slick Mist 200 at 4:30 pm, and the Budweiser Shootout was held at 8 pm. Kevin Harvick won the race for the second time in a row, becoming the first driver to win it consecutively since Tony Stewart.
* 2011: After the track was repaved in the off-season, teams found tandem drafting to become prevalent at the restrictive plate tracks during the preseason. During the final laps, the lead pack of four cars ran single file, with Ryan Newman in the lead, followed by Denny Hamlin, then Kurt Busch, and then Jamie McMurray. Coming out of Turn 4 on the final lap, Busch and McMurray pulled to the outside, while Denny Hamlin pulled to the inside. Hamlin exceeds track limits in passing Newman for the win, with Busch and McMurray passing Newman legally. Upon as review, Hamlin was dropped to the last car on the lead lap, in 13th, for exceeding track limits and all other drivers on the lead lap gained a position, giving Busch the win.
* 2012: Kyle Busch won the race after passing Tony Stewart at the finish line. It was the closest finish in Bud Shootout history. The race itself, being the first Sprint Cup event under a new rules package designed to break up the controversial two-car tandem drafting of the previous year, was marked by three multi-car crashes during the race caused by drivers getting into the left-rear quarter panel of another car. The first crash happened in the first 25 lap segment when Paul Menard got into David Ragan in turn 2, starting an eight car crash. The drivers involved were: Kasey Kahne, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Jeff Burton, David Ragan, Juan Pablo Montoya and Michael Waltrip. The second one happened on lap 55, also in turn 2. This one started when Marcos Ambrose turned Joey Logano loose. Several other drivers were collected trying to avoid Logano, including Kenseth, Martin Truex Jr., Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kevin Harvick. Harvick&#x27;s brakes failed, and he ended up coasting down the apron with flames coming out from under his car, though they extinguished themselves before Harvick reached the garage. A third crash happened with two laps to go within regulation, when Jeff Gordon got into the back of eventual winner Kyle Busch on turn 4. While Kyle retained control of his car, Gordon shot up the banking and collected Jimmie Johnson, Jamie McMurray and Kurt Busch, and turned sideways on the driver&#x27;s side door. Gordon was pushed down the track on his side for several hundred feet before his car barrel-rolled three times and came to a rest on his roof.
* 2013: Kevin Harvick won for the third time in the race. This was the first time the event was named the Sprint Unlimited. This race also marked the debut of the Sixth Generation car.
* 2014: Denny Hamlin won his second Unlimited by overtaking Brad Keselowski with drafting help from Kyle Busch with two laps to go. The first race under a new rules package that included a slightly taller spoiler, there were numerous wrecks, including a frightening wreck on lap 35 when Matt Kenseth was turned by Joey Logano in the trioval, collecting Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch, Tony Stewart, Danica Patrick, Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards and Ricky Stenhouse Jr., which saw Stenhouse&#x27;s car first drive under Busch&#x27;s rear wheels, lose its brakes and steering, before t-boning Patrick on the apron. The race also saw an incident during the break between the second and third segments in which the Holden Commodore safety car suffered an electrical fire with the wiring harness used to control the safety car lights suffered a wiring short circuit. There were 16 lead changes among seven drivers.
* 2015: Matt Kenseth won the race with Martin Truex Jr. challenging in the final laps. Brad Keselowski crashed hard on the front straight at lap 25, and Jamie McMurray caused the big one later in the race. After the race, defending series champion Kevin Harvick and Joey Logano were involved in an altercation after Logano&#x27;s 22 sent Harvick&#x27;s 4 into the turn four wall coming to the white flag.
* 2016: Hamlin took command of the field and moved ahead of the No. 2 car. Eventually, Keselowski moved by him coming to the line and took the lead on lap 34. Hamlin shot ahead of Keselowski on the backstretch to take the lead back the next lap. Keselowski used a push from teammate Joey Logano to retake the lead on lap 37. Just like his first stint in the lead, he picked up another piece of debris that covered his grill. The third caution of the race flew on lap 44 for a single-car spin on the backstretch. Going down the backstretch, Johnson made contact with Mears that sent him spinning through the grass. His car dug into the ground and ripped off the front fender. He said afterwards that he &quot;did a decent job of backing out of there and not causing a big one as the door shut on me.&quot; Keselowski opted to stay out while the rest of the field opted to pit, The race restarted with two laps to go in overtime, The field passed the overtime line and the race was official at that point. After a multi-car wreck in turn 1, Hamlin was declared the race winner.
*2017: For just the second time in the event&#x27;s history, the race was postponed from Saturday Night to Sunday Afternoon due to rain. Kurt Busch lasted just shy of 20 laps as Jimmie Johnson got loose off of turn 4 and spun Busch. Denny Hamlin dominated and looked to be on his way to his fourth win in the event leading 48 laps. After leading at the white flag, Brad Keselowski made a move to the inside that Hamlin left open, which led to Hamlin driving into Keselowski in a failed attempt to block him, ultimately ending their chances at winning. As the collision happened, Keselowski&#x27;s teammate Joey Logano was able to avoid the incident on the high side and ultimately won the event for the first time in his career over Kyle Busch and Alex Bowman. Danica Patrick managed to finish 4th after running 10th at the white flag.
*2018: Unlike all the other years, except for 2006 and 2017, the race was held on Sunday Afternoon. The race saw only two caution flags, one for the end of the segment, and the other caused by Jamie McMurray crashing in turn 4 after contact with Kurt Busch on lap 34. He would ultimately be the only one not running at the end of the race. This was the first race where crew members only allow five men over the wall instead of six, with the fastest pit stop going to Kurt Busch at 16.9 seconds. Brad Keselowski would win his first Clash race as a big wreck happened on the last lap where Kyle Larson turns Jimmie Johnson into the outside wall on the back straightaway collecting Kyle Busch, Chase Elliott, Kasey Kahne, and Martin Truex Jr.
*2019: For the first time in the race&#x27;s history, it was truncated due to rain. Paul Menard drew the pole and led 51 laps all through the rain-plagued race, breaking the record held by Dale Earnhardt Jr. for most laps led in the event. Rain red-flagged the race three times, first on lap 10, and a second time on lap 45. Racing was very tame as Menard led the entire 20 car field single file in the high groove. With more rain on the horizon, drivers were starting to make their moves. On lap 56 Jimmie Johnson got a run on Menard and in an attempt to get the lead by side-drafting, made contact with Menard. The ensuing contact triggered the &quot;Big One&quot; that involved 17 of the 20 cars in the field when Menard spun back across the track. As the field with Johnson now out in front circled the track under caution, rain began to fall once again. After being brought down pit road with 59 of the scheduled 75 laps completed and red-flagged for a third time, NASCAR called the race over, with Johnson taking home his second Clash triumph with controversy. Only eight of the 17 cars involved continued and were scored as having finished the race, resulting in only 11 of the 20 starters finishing the race. The race would ultimately be Johnson&#x27;s last NASCAR-sanctioned victory.
*2020: Three multiple-car crashes in the final ten laps and overtime was the last straw. With ten laps remaining, Joey Logano makes a block on Kyle Busch, causing a six-car incident in Turn 4. The race restarts with three laps remaining. William Byron and Ryan Newman make contact on the restart before the race is officially restarted, and a ten-car incident occurs. The race is extended to overtime. On the ensuing restart in the green-white-checkered finish, on Lap 78, another 11-car incident occurs in Turn 3, leading to a 7:27 red flag. On Lap 84, Turn 4 is the site of another crash with Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson, with Erik Jones also involved. Only six cars make the restart on Lap 87, which lets the one lapped car of Denny Hamlin, badly damaged, to push Erik Jones in the final two-lap restart. 
*2021: On March 4, 2020, NASCAR, fed up with the five massive incidents in the past 150 laps (from 2018 to 2020), and with plans for the seventh-generation cars to debut in 2021, and to alleviate an issue with nearby Super Bowl LV in Tampa, moves the Busch Clash to Tuesday night of Daytona 500 week, on the road course, and intended to be run with the current sixth-generation car as the last race before the new seventh-generation car would debut at Daytona the next night during qualifying. However, two weeks after the announcement, the season is suspended ten weeks because of a lockdown. When the season restarted, no qualifying would be held, and development of the new car was delayed where it would not debut until the 2022 season. Still, NASCAR decided to keep the road course plans. In July 2020, NASCAR replaced the Watkins Glen International race with a third race at Daytona, on the road course. In December 2020, NASCAR cancelled for the 2021 season the Fontana round by extending the Daytona race meeting into having the first two rounds of all three national series races at Daytona, one on the oval and one on the road course. In addition, the Clash format is changed to pole winners, former Daytona winners, and stage winners. The 35-lap race on the road course had only one engine failure causing a caution, and a collision in the Le Mans chicane resulting in no safety car. At the finish, Kyle Busch won in the final quarter mile of the race when Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney crashed in the chicane before pit entrance.

==Race notes==
* Six times the winner of the Clash at Daytona has gone on to win the Daytona 500 the following weekend: Bobby Allison (1982), Bill Elliott (1987), Dale Jarrett (1996, 2000), Jeff Gordon (1997), and Denny Hamlin (2016).
* Though there have been drivers who have won all three of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series events of Speedweeks at Daytona – the Clash at Daytona, the Can-Am Duel, and the Daytona 500 – there has not yet been a driver who won all three events in the same year. Twice, an Earnhardt won two of the events, but came up short by losing to Dale Jarrett in the third: in 2004, Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the Budweiser Duel and the Daytona 500, but finished second to Jarrett in the Unlimited. In 1993, Dale Earnhardt won the Unlimited and the Budweiser Duel, but finished second to Jarrett in the Daytona 500. In 2014, Denny Hamlin joined this group, winning the Unlimited and the second Duel race, but losing to Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the 500.
* While it was still named the Busch Clash, on two occasions, the race had the year in its official title. The Busch Clash of &#x27;89 and the Busch Clash of &#x27;93 were the respective advertised titles.
* From 1979 until 2008, the drivers themselves qualified as eligible for the Budweiser Shootout, not the teams. If an eligible driver for the upcoming Shootout switches teams in the off-season, the driver, not the team, is eligible for the race. That driver competes in the race with his new team.
* Until 2008, drivers who win the pole award at a race must have had an Anheuser-Busch decal (the Busch brand from 1979 to 1997, and the Budweiser brand 1998–2007), or the corporate logo affixed to their car (for drivers under 21 years of age) at the time in order to earn the berth for the Budweiser Shootout. If the car does not carry the sticker, the Budweiser Pole Award goes to the next car eligible, but the driver which wins the Budweiser Pole Award does not earn a Shootout spot.
** In 1998, John Andretti was eligible to race in the Bud Shootout for having won a pole position in 1997 racing for Cale Yarborough. In the off-season, Andretti switched to Petty Enterprises, which was not allowed to participate, since they chose not to affix the proper decals to their cars – it was Petty family tradition to not permit alcohol decals or sponsorship on their cars. Andretti participated in the race in a one-off ride with Hendrick Motorsports. (Ricky Craven, the regular driver for Hendrick&#x27;s Budweiser-sponsored Chevrolet, did not qualify for the race; Andretti drove the Hendrick car, which carried the usual No. 25 instead of the No. 50 otherwise used by the team for NASCAR&#x27;s 50-year celebration in 1998.)
** Bobby Hamilton won the pole position for the 1997 Miller 400 racing for Petty Enterprises, but was not eligible for the 1998 Bud Shootout since the team chose not to affix the proper decal.
** John Andretti won the pole position for the 1998 Primestar 500 racing for Petty Enterprises, but was not eligible for the 1999 Bud Shootout since the team chose not to affix the proper decal. Todd Bodine was the official winner of the Bud Pole Award by NASCAR rule, but not awarded a Budweiser Shootout position.
** Jeff Green won the pole position for the 2003 Daytona 500 racing Richard Childress Racing&#x27;s No. 30 AOL Chevrolet, but did not participate in the 2004 Budweiser Shootout. Green changed teams twice in 2003 ending up in the No. 43 Petty Enterprises Dodge (which he also signed to drive in 2004). As usual, since the team chose not to affix the proper decal the No. 43 was ineligible for the Shootout. Green could have driven for another team, but chose not to do so.
** Aric Almirola drove the Richard Petty Motorsports No. 43, which does not have the (since 2008) Molson Coors Brewing Company-provided Pole Award sticker (Coors Light or Coors Brewing 21 Means 21), per Petty policy. With InBev withdrawing sponsorship of the Shootout, the 2013 Shootout does not have an alcohol sticker mandate, the circuit he will be in the first race of the new 2013 format.
* Drivers must carry a special decal without the alcohol brand if they are under 21 years of age, but could race in the Shootout. Drivers must be 21 or older to wear alcohol decals, and those under 21 must wear a special sticker, which during Anheuser-Busch era was a corporate logo Pole Award sticker, without any brand indication, and since Molson&#x27;s Coors Light took over in 2008, a &quot;Coors Brewing Company 21 Means 21&quot; sticker. Special stickers are made to cover up alcohol for such drivers, which has happened four times involving two drivers:
** On May 14, 2004, 20-year-old Brian Vickers won the pole at Richmond in the Chevy American Revolution 400.
** On September 3, 2004, Vickers won the pole at the Pop Secret 500 at Fontana.
** On February 26, 2005, 19-year-old Kyle Busch won his first pole at the very same race in Fontana.
** On April 20, 2006, Busch won the pole at Avondale, Arizona at 20 years, 353 days.
* Except during 2013 to 2019, drivers under 21 were not permitted to participate in formal activities relating to the race, such as the draw for position and other activities such as conferences related to the race because of the alcohol sponsorship. In those cases, the crew chief will participate in such activities. The suspension of the alcohol sponsorship between the time period eliminated the rule.
** In the 2005 Shootout (Vickers under age), Lance McGrew, who was the new crew chief for Vickers that season, participated in the Shootout draw.
** In the 2006 Shootout (Busch under age), Alan Gustafson participated in the Shootout draw.
** In the 2009 Shootout (Joey Logano under age), Greg Zipadelli participated in the Shootout draw.
* Dale Jarrett (2000) and Tony Stewart (2002, 2007) are the only drivers to win the Budweiser Shootout without having won a pole position the previous year. Jarrett advanced to the Shootout by winning the Bud Shootout Qualifier, and Stewart was eligible for the Shootout via the 2001 rule change adding a lifetime exemption for former winners.
* 2006 Shootout winner Denny Hamlin was the first rookie to win the event. He had won the pole at Phoenix in a seven-race tryout for Joe Gibbs Racing to find a driver for the FedEx No. 11 car late in the 2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series season. A driver can make up to five (until 2000) or seven (since 2001) starts in a season, or run portions of a season and not be declared in that series (since 2011), without giving up their eligibility to be a rookie in that series.

<text>Scott Hale Reiniger (born September 5, 1948) is an American actor. He is a professor at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Los Angeles, California. He played Roger in the 1978 horror film &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;.

==Biography==
Scott Hale Reiniger, Jr. was born in White Plains, New York. He is a graduate of Rollins College in Theater Arts.

Following his appearance as Roger in George A. Romero&#x27;s original &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; in 1978, Reiniger played Marhalt in Romero&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Knightriders&quot;. He also made a cameo appearance in the 2004 remake of&quot; Dawn of the Dead&quot; directed by Zack Snyder.

He teaches at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Hollywood.

=== Afghan lineage ===
In 2004 it was discoverd that Reiniger is the &quot;Prince of Ghor,&quot; a province in western Afghanistan. Reiniger&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather, Josiah Harlan, was the first American to set foot in Afghanistan. Harlan was granted sovereignty in perpetuity for himself and his descendants by Refee Beg in exchange for military support. The Hazaras had been raided by Uzbek warlords, particularly Murad Beg, and were nominal vassals of the Emperor of Afghanistan.

The Emir Dost Mohammad Khan sent Josiah Harlan with an armed group to collect tribute from the Hazaras. The Hazara leaders, of whom the most prominent was Refee Beg, offered to send tribute if Harlan would unite them in the struggle against the raiding Uzbek warlords. The agreement reached included Harlan being made hereditary paramount ruler and advocate. British forces later negotiated with the Emperor for the departure and loss of temporal power of Harlan.

<text>A cycle count is a perpetual inventory auditing procedure, where you follow a regularly repeated sequence of checks on a subset of inventory. Cycle counts contrast with traditional physical inventory in that a traditional physical inventory ceases operations at a facility while all items are counted. Cycle counts are less disruptive to daily operations, provide an ongoing measure of inventory accuracy and procedure execution, and can be tailored to focus on items with higher value, higher movement volume, or that are critical to business processes. Although some say that cycle counting should only be performed in facilities with a high degree of inventory accuracy (greater than 95%), cycle counting is a means of achieving and sustaining high degrees of accuracy. Cycle counting can be used to identify root causes of problems in control processes and then monitor the effectiveness of the actions to eliminate the root causes. In contrast, identifying root causes of inventory errors, agreeing on actions to eliminate them to the point of perfecting control processes is virtually impossible with traditional inventory audit approaches.

==ABC analysis==
Most cycle counting applications use ABC analysis, segregating items into various count frequencies using the Pareto method (see below).

==Method==
There are several methods of selecting which items to count and with what frequency, and each method has strengths and weaknesses.

===Pareto method===
The Pareto method, derived from the Pareto principle, is to cycle count inventory by percentage of inventory value. Items with a higher determined value are counted more often, while items that have little movement are seldom counted. This approach is usually based on value which appeals to accountants by minimizing the variance in inventory value. The analysis may also be based on usage from an operational point of view. This is perceived as being more efficient from a supply chain management perspective by concentrating effort on higher volume of use items. The main shortcoming is that low value items may be ignored and cause an entire assembly line to halt while a minor component is re-ordered.

===Hybrid===
There are also hybrids of the ABC method. The most common would be to use [cost*usage] and adjusted based on certain criteria that&#x27;s critical to the organization&#x27;s performance.

===Cycle counting by usage only===
Cycle counting by usage states that items more frequently accessed should be counted more often, irrespective of value. Every time an item is added or removed, there is a risk of introducing inventory variance. Logical inventory zones can be set up to distinguish items depending on how frequently they are touched. This method may be biased against counting higher value inventory or require additional counting to satisfy accounting requirements.

===Opportunity based===
This method conducts inventory checks at key points in the material management process. The inventory is audited at re-order points, when a certain amount is used, or when inventory levels are low.

===Statistical Process Control===
This method uses statistical process control to audit items with the highest chance of inventory inaccuracy.

===Geographic===
Also known as &quot;location based&quot; or &quot;by surface area&quot;. Cycle counting that begins from one end of the company to the other. Combing over each rack or shelf, that is assigned per counter. This method may require planning, in which a map of the company is required and counting forms for the recording of stock information that will then need updating to the inventory management system.

==Process Steps Best Practices==
The basic process of cycle counting is generate list, audit, review, repeat. It&#x27;s important to the success of any cycle counting program to have 6S in place prior to beginning.

===Organize===
The implementation of a 6S culture is important.

* Segregate scrap, expired, and, non-conforming materials from good inventory.
* Store items in an orderly matter. Inventory should be properly identified and stacked evenly in the proper location.
* Everything should be clean and without clutter.
* Bulk items have standard pack sizes and WIP quantities are controlled.
* The stored items have limited access. Responsibility of inventory transactions are defined and clearly understood. Develop specialists that are proficient in auditing inventory and finding solutions to inventory errors.
* Conduct and record daily safety observations to ensure auditors are not at risk of injury.

===Generate List===
Produce a list of items to audit according to the method best suited for the company.
===Audit===
Verify quantities using trained personnel.
===Review===
* Define any problems.
* Measure by increasing the regularity of counts for items that may be affected by perceived problem.
* Analyze the data collected from the repeated counts.
* Improve or design a process to bring inventory accuracy into acceptable tolerances.
* Control or verify the performance of the improved process.

===Repeat===

==Automation==
To conduct efficient and accurate cycle counts, many organizations use some form of software to implement an inventory control system, which is part of a warehouse management system. These systems may include mobile computers with integrated barcode scanners that allow the operator to automatically identify items, and enter inventory counts via keypad. The software transmits data to a database on a host system which can generate inventory reports.

Based on user defined criteria, the software will select a number of items to count at specific locations for the specified period of time. Ideally, these selections are daily but many companies choose to generate cycle count items weekly.

Many companies perform &quot;mini&quot; physical inventories and call it cycle counts. Instead of using random or system generated part numbers at specific locations to count, they selectively choose specific locations and count everything in those locations. As part of their procedures they rotate throughout the plant with the intention of counting every location a minimum of once each year. This is an effective alternative to true cycle counting where a company may not have the sophistication to utilize cycle counting software.

==Risks==
Cycle counts, like traditional physical inventory counts, can introduce inventory errors if the process is poorly executed. Multiple locations per item, work in process, and lag in paperwork processing can each contribute to errors. This problem can be mitigated with correct cycle count procedures that specify not only the part number to be counted but also the location it should be in. Some experts believe that cycle counting is only effective in companies with a well-defined inventory control procedure and a high degree of inventory accuracy but this has proven not to be true in practice.

Cycle counts should only be conducted by trained and tested personnel to reduce the risks of inventory loss. Physical counts typically count all inventory in a fixed location and later reconcile with the inventory control system. A cycle count may, but not necessarily, start with the inventory control system and reconciles to locations. Its an important distinction when deciding who carries out the audit and how well trained they are. For example, if inventory exists in location A, B, and C and someone physically moves C to D without transaction, the inventory control system will continue to show inventory in A, B, and C. At the time of cycle count, the control system will direct the counter to A, B, and C where they will find C missing. Unless inventory in D, which could be anywhere, is discovered, C runs the risk of being adjusted to 0 and written off. This is why it&#x27;s important to only use personnel with a proven ability (through testing) to conduct the audits correctly. If the personnel performing the counts is not taken seriously, D may not be picked up unless a physical count is performed so, an operation that relies only on untrained personnel conducting the cycle counts is likely to experience a net loss of inventory.

==Goal==
The goal of cycle counting is to eliminate counting.

<doc id="682782" wikidata="Q1065821" url="?curid=682782" title="Dog days">
<text>The dog days or are the hot, sultry days of summer. They were historically the period following the heliacal rising of the star system Sirius (known colloquially as the &quot;Dog Star&quot;), which Hellenistic astrology connected with heat, drought, sudden thunderstorms, lethargy, fever, mad dogs, and bad luck. They are now taken to be the hottest, most uncomfortable part of summer in the Northern Hemisphere.

==Etymology==

The English name is a calque of the Latin (), itself a calque of the ancient Greek (). The Greeks knew the star α Canis Majoris by several names, including Sirius &quot;Scorcher&quot; (, &quot;Seírios&quot;), Sothis (, &quot;Sôthis&quot;, a transcription of Egyptian &quot;Spdt&quot;), and the Dog Star (, &quot;Kúōn&quot;). The last name reflects the way Sirius follows the constellation Orion into the night sky.

==History==
Sirius is by far the brightest proper star in the night sky, which caused ancient astronomers to take note of it around the world. In Egypt, its return to the night sky became known as a precursor to the annual flooding of the Nile and was worshipped as the goddess Sopdet. In Greece, it became known as the precursor of the unpleasantly hot phase of the summer. Greek poets even recorded the belief that the return of the bright star was responsible for bringing heat and fever with it; it was also associated with sudden thunderstorms. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, probably composed in the but representing an earlier tradition, Achilles&#x27;s approach toward Troy, where he will slay Hector, is illustrated through an extended metaphor about the baleful effects attending the return of Sirius:
The rising of Sirius during this period has been calculated as 19 July (Julian). Writing about the same time, Hesiod considered the worst and hottest part of the summer to be the days &quot;before&quot; Sirius returned to the night sky. During this period, Sirius was invisible from the earth but it was apparently understood to still be in the sky, augmenting the power of the sun:


This effect of the combination of Sirius&#x27; light with the Sun&#x27;s was understood to have an effect on plants, animals, and women, as well as men:
About a century later, Alcaeus repeated the theme, advising his listeners to &quot;steep your lungs in wine&quot; before the arrival of the star since &quot;women are at their foulest but men are weak since they are parched in head and knees&quot;. In the 3rd century, Aratus&#x27; &quot;Phenomena&quot; describes the time as Sirius blighting the bark of trees with its heat during the time it rises and sets with the sun.

The Kean priests of Zeus as Rainmaker and Lord of Moisture observed annual sacrifices before the rise of Sirius to prevent scorching drought. This practice was credited to the culture hero Aristaeus. Aristotle mentions the proverbial heat of the dog days as part of his argument against an early formulation of evolution in his &quot;Physics&quot;.
The Romans continued to blame Sirius for the heat of the season and attendant lethargy and diseases. In his &quot;Georgics&quot;, Vergil notes vintners&#x27; efforts to protect their work during the time &quot;when the Dog-star cleaves the thirsty Ground&quot;. Seneca&#x27;s Oedipus complains of &quot;the scorching dog-star&#x27;s fires&quot;. Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; notes an increase in attacks by dogs during July and August, and advises feeding them chicken manure to curb the tendency. In the early 20th century, historians still noted the &quot;discouraging heat&quot; and &quot;oppression&quot; of the dog days of the Roman summer.

The period has long featured in western medicine. The 1564 English &quot;Hope of Health&quot; counseled that purging (bloodletting and induced vomiting) should be avoided during the &quot;Dogge daies&quot; of summer because &quot;the Sunne is in Leo&quot; and &quot;then is nature burnt vp &amp; made weake&quot;. The 1729 British &quot;Husbandman&#x27;s Practice&quot; claimed that &quot;The Heat of the Sun is so violent that Men&#x27;s bodies at Midnight sweat as at Midday: and if they be hurt, they be more sick than at any other time, yea very near Dead&quot;. It therefore advised men to &quot;abstain all this time from women&quot; and to &quot;take heed of feeding violently&quot;. In the 1813 &quot;Clavis Calendria&quot;, the dog days are a time wherein &quot;the Sea boiled, the Wine turned sour, Dogs grew mad, Quinto raged with anger, and all other creatures became languid; causing to man, among other diseases, burning fevers, hysterics, and phrensies&quot;.
Even after astrology and its influence on health and agriculture waned in importance, the &quot;dog days&quot; continues to be vaguely applied to the hottest days of the summer, with its attendant effects on nature and society. In North America, it became proverbial among farmers that a dry growing season through the dog days was preferable to the trouble of a wet one:

Because &quot;July is typically one of the quietest months of the year for stock trading&quot;, the term is sometimes used for the lethargic summer markets.

==Span==
Various computations of the dog days have placed their start anywhere from 3 July to 15 August and lasting for anywhere from 30 to 61 days. They may begin or end with the cosmical rising or heliacal rising of either Sirius in Canis Major or Procyon (the &quot;Little Dog Star&quot;) in Canis Minor and vary by latitude, not even being visible throughout much of the Southern Hemisphere. Sirius observes a period of almost exactly 365¼ days between risings, keeping it largely consistent with the Julian but not the Gregorian calendar; nonetheless, its dates occur somewhat later in the year over a span of millennia.

In antiquity, the dog days were usually reckoned from the appearance of Sirius around 19 July (Julian) to relieving rains and cool winds, although Hesiod seems to have counted the worst of summer as the days leading up to Sirius&#x27;s reappearance.

In Anglo-Saxon England, the dog days ran from various dates in mid-July to early or mid-September. Canonical &quot;dog daies&quot; were observed from July 7 to September 5 in the 16th-century English liturgies. They were removed from the prayer books at the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and their term shortened to the time between July 19 and August 20. During the British adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1752, they were shifted from July 30 to September 7.

Many modern sources in the English-speaking world move this still earlier, from July 3 to August 11, ending rather than beginning with or centering on the reappearance of Sirius to the night sky.

==Scientific basis==
Although Sirius is the brightest proper star in the night sky, it is away from Earth and has no effect whatsoever on the planet&#x27;s weather or temperature. Although the star continues to return to the night sky in late summer, its position continues to gradually shift relative to the Sun and will rise in the middle of winter in about 10,000 years.

The effects of summer heat and rainfall patterns are real, but vary by latitude and location according to many factors. For example, London, UK, is slightly farther north than Calgary, Canada, but has a milder climate from the presence of the sea and the warm Gulf Stream current. A medical institution has reported a connection between Finland&#x27;s dog days and increased risk of infection in deep surgery wounds, although that research remains unverified.

==In popular culture==

It is possible that Saint Roch, the legendary medieval patron saint of dogs celebrated by the Catholic Church on 16 August, owes some of his legacy to the dog days. From the period of his self-proclaimed protectorate over the island, the Danish adventurer Jørgen Jørgensen is remembered in Iceland as Jørgen the Dog-Day King ().

In western literature, apart from the Greek and Roman works mentioned above, the dog days appear in John Webster&#x27;s 1613 play &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, Charles Dickens&#x27; 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, R.H. Davis&#x27;s 1903 short story &quot;The Bar Sinister&quot;, J.M. Synge&#x27;s 1909 poem &quot;Queens&quot;, and Richard Adams&#x27;s 1972 novel &quot;Watership Down&quot;. They feature in the children&#x27;s novels &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; (1973), and &quot;Dog Days&quot; (2009) from the &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; series.

&quot;Dog Days&quot; is also the title of a Japanese anime series that premiered in 2011. The story revolves around a boy named Shinku Izumi, who is summoned to an alternate world where the inhabitants have animal ears and tails.

In film, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975) and (German for &quot;Dog Days&quot;; 2001) evoke their oppressive seasonal settings. The 2010 videogame Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days utilizes the term to a similar effect.

In music, there are Head of David&#x27;s &quot;Dog Day Sunrise&quot;, covered by Fear Factory in 1995; Florence and the Machine&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Dog Days Are Over&quot;; and Within Temptation&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Dog Days&quot;; as well as the album &quot;Dog Days&quot; by the US southern rock band Atlanta Rhythm Section; in the title track from Taylor Swift&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Evermore&quot;, Bon Iver, who is featured on the song, mentions &quot;the violence of the dog days&quot;.

&quot;Dog Days&quot; is also the title of a 2012 opera by composer David T. Little and librettist Royce Vavrek, based on the short story by Judy Budnitz.

&quot;Dog-day&quot; promotions are also a common feature in baseball, used by American ballparks to boost ticket sales during mid-afternoon games.

<text>The Pechenegs () or Patzinaks were a semi-nomadic Turkic people from Central Asia who spoke the Pecheneg language. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Pechenegs controlled much of the steppes of southeast Europe and the Crimean Peninsula. In the 9th century the Pechenegs began a period of wars against Kievan Rus&#x27;, and for more than two centuries launched raids into the lands of Rus&#x27;, which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars.

== Ethnonym ==

The Pechenegs were mentioned as &quot;Bjnak&quot;, &quot;Bjanak&quot; or &quot;Bajanak&quot; in medieval Arabic and Persian texts, as &quot;Be-ča-nag&quot; in Classical Tibetan documents, and as &quot;Pačanak-i&quot; in works written in Georgian. Anna Komnene and other Byzantine authors referred to them as &quot;Patzinakoi&quot; or &quot;Patzinakitai&quot;. In medieval Latin texts, the Pechenegs were referred to as &quot;Pizenaci&quot;, &quot;Bisseni&quot; or &quot;Bessi&quot;. East Slavic peoples use the terms &quot;Pečenegi&quot; or &quot;Pečenezi&quot; (plural of &quot;Pečeneg&quot;), while the Poles mention them as &quot;Pieczyngowie&quot; or &quot;Piecinigi&quot;. The Hungarian word for Pecheneg is &quot;Besenyő&quot;; the Romanian term is &quot;Pecenegi&quot;.

According to Max Vasmer and some other researchers the ethnonym may have derived from the Old Turkic word for &quot;brother-in-law, relative” (&quot;baja&quot;, &quot;baja-naq&quot; or &quot;bajinaq&quot;; , Kyrgyz&quot;: baja&quot;, and ), implying that it initially referred to an &quot;in-law related clan or tribe&quot;. Peter Golden considers this derivation by no means certain.

In Mahmud Kashgari&#x27;s 11th-century work Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, Pechenegs were described as &quot;a Turkic nation living around the country of the Rum&quot;, where &quot;Rum&quot; was the Turkic word for the Eastern Roman Empire or Anatolia, and &quot;a branch of Oghuz Turks&quot;; he subsequently described the Oghuz as being formed of 22 branches, of which the Pecheneg were the 19th.

Pechenegs are mentioned as one of 24 ancient tribes of Oghuzes by 14th-century statesman and historian of Ilkhanate-ruled Iran Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in his work Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh (&quot;Compendium of Chronicles&quot;) with the meaning of the ethnonym as &quot;the one who shows eagerness&quot;. The 17th-century Khan of the Khanate of Khiva and historian Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur mentions the Pechenegs as &quot;bechene&quot; among 24 ancient tribes of Turkmens (or Oghuzes) in his book &quot;Shajara-i Tarākima&quot; (“Genealogy of the Turkmen&quot;) and provides for its meaning as &quot;the one who makes&quot;.

Three of the eight Pecheneg &quot;provinces&quot; or clans were collectively known as Kangars. According to Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the Kangars received this denomination because &quot;they are more valiant and noble than the rest&quot; of the people &quot;and that is what the title Kangar signifies&quot;. Because no Turkic word with a similar meaning is known, Ármin Vámbéry connected the ethnonym to the Kyrgyz words &quot;kangir&quot; (&quot;agile&quot;), &quot;kangirmak&quot; (&quot;to go out riding&quot;) and &quot;kani-kara&quot; (&quot;black-blooded&quot;), while Carlile Aylmer Macartney associated it with the Chagatai word &quot;gang&quot; (&quot;chariot&quot;), semantically related to the Turkic Gaoche.

Omeljan Pritsak proposed that the name had initially been a composite term &quot;(Kängär As&quot;, mentioned in Old Turkic texts) deriving from the Tocharian word for stone &quot;(kank)&quot; and the ethnonym &quot;As&quot;, suggesting that they were Tocharian-speaking or at least formed a confederation consisting of Tocharian, Eastern Iranian and Bulgaric Turkic elements. Their connection with Eastern Iranian elements is hinted at in the remark of al-Biruni regarding a people that &quot;are of the race of al-Lān and that of al-Ās and their language is a mixture of the languages of Khwarazmians and the Badjanak.&quot;. 

If the latter assumption is valid, the Kangars&#x27; ethnonym suggests that (East) Iranian elements contributed to the formation of the Pecheneg people but Spinei concedes that Pechenegs were of &quot;a predominantly Turkic character... beyond any doubt&quot;. This may be mirrored in the Old Rus translation of Josephus Flavius (ed. Meshcherskiy, 454) which adds &quot;the Yas, as is known, descended from the Pecheneg tribe.&quot; On the basis of their fragmentary linguistic remains, scholars view them as Common Turkic-speakers, most probably Kipchak (Németh, followed by Ligeti) or Oguz (Baskakov). Hammer-Purgstall classifies the Chinese Kangju and Byzantine Kangar as purely Turkic name variants of the Kangly; however, Wang Pu&#x27;s institutional historical work Tang Huiyao apparently distinguishes the &quot;Kang(ju)&quot; from the &quot;Kangheli&quot; (aka &quot;Kangly&quot;). Menges saw in &quot;Kang-ar-as&quot; the plural-suffix &quot;-as&quot;, and Klyashtorny the Turkic numerus collectivus &quot;-ar-&quot;, &quot;-er-&quot;.

== Language ==
Mahmud al-Kashgari, an 11th-century man of letters who specialized in Turkic dialects argued that the language spoken by the Pechenegs was a variant of the Cuman and Oghuz idioms. He suggested that foreign influences on the Pechenegs gave rise to phonetical differences between their tongue and the idiom spoken by other Turkic peoples. Anna Komnene likewise stated that the Pechenegs and the Cumans shared a common language. Although the Pecheneg language itself died out centuries ago, the names of the Pecheneg &quot;provinces&quot; recorded by Constantine Porphyrogenitus prove that the Pechenegs spoke a Turkic language. The Pechenegs are thought to have belonged to the Oghuz branch of the Turkic family, but their language is poorly documented and therefore difficult to further classify.

==Composition==

Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos lists eight Pecheneg tribal groupings, four on each side of the Dnieper river, reflecting the bipartite left-right Turkic organization. These eight tribes were in turn divided into 40 sub-tribes, probably clans. Constantine VII also records the names of eight former tribal leaders who had been leading the Pechenegs when they were expelled by the Khazars and Oghuzes. Golden, following Németh and Ligeti, proposes that each tribal name consists of two parts: the first part being an equine coat color, the other the tribal ruler&#x27;s title.

The Erdim, Čur, and Yula tribes formed the Qangar/Kenger (Greek: Καγγαρ) and were deemed &quot;more valiant and noble than the rest&quot;.

=== Notes ===
== History ==

=== Origins and area ===
According to Omeljan Pritsak, the Pechenegs are descendants from the ancient Kangars who originate from Tashkent. The Orkhon inscriptions listed the Kangars among the subject peoples of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. Pritsak says that the Pechenegs&#x27; homeland was located between the Aral Sea and the middle course of the Syr Darya, along the important trade routes connecting Central Asia with Eastern Europe, and associates them with Kangars.

According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, writing in c. 950, Patzinakia, the Pecheneg realm, stretched west as far as the Siret River (or even the Eastern Carpathian Mountains), and was four days distant from &quot;Tourkias&quot; (i.e. Hungary).
Paul Pelliot originated the proposal that the &quot;Book of Sui&quot;a 7th-century Chinese workpreserved the earliest record on the Pechenegs. The book mentioned a people named &quot;Bĕirù&quot;, who had settled near the &quot;Ēnqū&quot; and &quot;Alan&quot; peoples (identified as Onogurs and Alans, respectively), to the east of &quot;Fulin&quot; (or the Eastern Roman Empire). Victor Spinei emphasizes that the Pechenegs&#x27; association with the &quot;Bĕirù&quot; is &quot;uncertain&quot;. He proposes that an 8th-century Uighur envoy&#x27;s report, which survives in Tibetan translation, contains the first certain reference to the Pechenegs. The report recorded an armed conflict between the &quot;Be-ča-nag&quot; and the &quot;Hor&quot; (Uyghurs or Oghuz Turks) peoples in the region of the river Syr Darya.

Ibn Khordadbeh (c. 820 – 912 CE), Mahmud al-Kashgari (11th century), Muhammad al-Idrisi (1100–1165), and many other Muslim scholars agree that the Pechenegs belonged to the Turkic peoples. The &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot; stated that the &quot;Torkmens, Pechenegs, Torks, and Polovcians&quot; descended from &quot;the godless sons of Ishmael, who had been sent as a chastisement to the Christians&quot;.

=== Westward migration ===

The Turkic Khaganate collapsed in 744 which gave rise to a series of intertribal confrontations in the Eurasian steppes. The Karluks attacked the Oghuz Turks, forcing them to launch a westward migration towards the Pechenegs&#x27; lands. The Uighur envoy&#x27;s report testifies that the Oghuz and Pecheneg waged war against each other already in the 8th century, most probably for the control of the trade routes. The Oghuz made an alliance with the Karluks and Kimaks and defeated the Pechenegs and their allies in a battle near the Lake Aral before 850, according to the 10th-century scholar, Al-Masudi. Most Pechenegs launched a new migration towards the Volga River, but some groups were forced to join the Oghuz. The latter formed the 19th tribe of the Oghuz tribal federation in the 11th century.

The Pechenegs who left their homeland settled between the Ural and Volga rivers. According to Gardizi and other Muslim scholars who based their works on 9th-century sources, the Pechenegs&#x27; new territory was quite large, with a 30-day-walk extension, and were bordered by the Cumans, Khazars, Oghuz Turks and Slavs.

The same sources also narrate that the Pechenegs made regular raids against their neighbors, in particular against the Khazars and the latter&#x27;s vassals, the Burtas, and sold their captives. The Khazars made an alliance with the Ouzes against the Pechenegs and attacked them from two directions. Outnumbered by the enemy, the Pechenegs were forced into a new westward migration. They marched across the Khazar Khaganate, invaded the dwelling places of the Hungarians, and expelled them from the lands along the Kuban River and the upper course of the river Donets. There is no consensual date for this second migration of the Pechenegs: Pritsak argues that it took place around 830, but Kristó suggests that it could hardly occur before the 850s.

The Pechenegs settled along the rivers Donets and Kuban. It is plausible that the distinction between the &quot;Turkic Pechenegs&quot; and &quot;Khazar Pechenegs&quot; mentioned in the 10th-century &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;alam&quot; had its origin in this period. The &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;Alam&quot;a late 10th-century Persian geographydistinguished two Pecheneg groups, referring to those who lived along the Donets as &quot;Turkic Pechenegs&quot;, and to those along the Kuban as &quot;Khazarian Pechenegs&quot;. Spinei proposes that the latter denomination most probably refers to Pecheneg groups accepting Khazar suzerainty, implies that some Pecheneg tribes had been forced to acknowledge the Khazars supremacy.

In addition to these two branches, a third group of Pechenegs existed in this period: Constantine Porphyrogenitus and Ibn Fadlan mention that those who decided not to leave their homeland were incorporated into the Oghuz federation of Turkic tribes.

However, it is uncertain whether this group&#x27;s formation is connected to the Pechenegs&#x27; first or second migration (as it is proposed by Pritsak and Golden, respectively). According to Mahmud al-Kashgari, one of the Üçok clans of the Oghuz Turks was still formed by Pechenegs in the 1060s.

=== Alliance with Byzantium ===
In the 9th century, the Byzantines allied with the Pechenegs, using them to fend off other, more dangerous tribes such as Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Magyars (Hungarians).

The Uzes, another Turkic steppe people, eventually expelled the Pechenegs from their homeland; in the process, they also seized most of their livestock and other goods. An alliance of Oghuz, Kimeks, and Karluks was also pressing the Pechenegs, but another group, the Samanids, defeated that alliance. Driven further west by the Khazars and Cumans by 889, the Pechenegs in turn drove the Magyars west of the Dnieper River by 892.

Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria employed the Pechenegs to help fend off the Magyars. The Pechenegs were so successful that they drove out the Magyars remaining in Etelköz and the Pontic steppes, forcing them westward towards the Pannonian plain, where they later founded the Hungarian state.

=== Late history and decline ===

By the 9th and 10th centuries, Pechenegs controlled much of the steppes of southeast Europe and the Crimean Peninsula. Although an important factor in the region at the time, like most nomadic tribes their concept of statecraft failed to go beyond random attacks on neighbours and spells as mercenaries for other powers.

In the 9th century the Pechenegs began a period of wars against Kievan Rus&#x27;. For more than two centuries they had launched raids into the lands of Rus&#x27;, which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars (like the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev, reported in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;). The Pecheneg wars against Kievan Rus&#x27; caused the Slavs from Walachian territories to gradually migrate north of the Dniestr in the 10th and 11th centuries. Rus&#x27;/Pecheneg temporary military alliances also occurred however, as during the Byzantine campaign in 943 led by Igor. 
In 968 the Pechenegs attacked and besieged Kiev; some joined the Prince of Kiev, Sviatoslav I, in his Byzantine campaign of 970–971, though eventually they ambushed and killed the Kievan prince in 972. According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, the Pecheneg Khan Kurya made a chalice from Sviatoslav&#x27;s skull, in accordance with the custom of steppe nomads. The fortunes of the Rus&#x27;-Pecheneg confrontation swung during the reign of Vladimir I of Kiev (990–995), who founded the town of Pereyaslav upon the site of his victory over the Pechenegs, followed by the defeat of the Pechenegs during the reign of Yaroslav I the Wise in 1036. Shortly thereafter, other nomadic peoples replaced the weakened Pechenegs in the Pontic steppe: the Cumans and the Torks. According to Mykhailo Hrushevsky (&quot;History of Ukraine-Ruthenia&quot;), after its defeat near Kiev the Pecheneg Horde moved towards the Danube, crossed the river, and disappeared out of the Pontic steppes.

Pecheneg mercenaries served under the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert. After centuries of fighting involving all their neighbours—the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, Kievan Rus&#x27;, Khazaria, and the Magyars—the Pechenegs were annihilated as an independent force in 1091 at the Battle of Levounion by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army under Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Alexios I recruited the defeated Pechenegs, whom he settled in the district of Moglena (today in Macedonia) into a tagma &quot;of the Moglena Pechenegs&quot;. Attacked again in 1094 by the Cumans, many Pechenegs were slain or absorbed. The Byzantines defeated the Pechenegs again at the Battle of Beroia in 1122, on the territory of modern-day Bulgaria. With time the Pechenegs south of the Danube lost their national identity and became fully assimilated, mostly with Romanians and Bulgarians. Significant communities settled in the Hungarian kingdom, around 150 villages.

In the 12th century, according to Byzantine historian John Kinnamos, the Pechenegs fought as mercenaries for the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos in southern Italy against the Norman king of Sicily, William the Bad. A group of Pechenegs was present at the Battle of Andria in 1155.
The Pechenegs as a group were last mentioned in 1168 as members of Turkic tribes known in the chronicles as the &quot;Chorni Klobuky (Black Hats)&quot;. It is likely that the Pecheneg population of Hungary was decimated by the Mongol invasion of Hungary, but names of Pecheneg origin continue to be reported in official documents. The title of &quot;Comes Bissenorum&quot; (Count of the Pechenegs) lasted for at least another 200 years.

In 15th-century Hungary, some people adopted the surname &quot;Besenyö&quot; (Hungarian for &quot;Pecheneg&quot;); they were most numerous in the county of Tolna. One of the earliest introductions of Islam into Eastern Europe came about through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner who was captured by the Byzantines. The Muslim prisoner was brought into the Besenyő territory of the Pechenegs, where he taught and converted individuals to Islam. In the late 12th century, Abu Hamid al-Gharnati referred to Hungarian Pechenegs – probably Muslims – living disguised as Christians. In the southeast of Serbia, there is a village called Pečenjevce founded by Pechenegs. After war with Byzantium, the remnants of the tribes found refuge in the area, where they established their settlement.

<text>HMS &quot;Cromer&quot; is a former commissioned by the Royal Navy in 1992. She was named after the North Norfolk seaside town of the same name.

HMS &quot;Cromer&quot; visited Dundee on 6–9 November 1998 (for a Dundee navy day and Armistice Day commemorations) when she was accompanied by various warships from European countries including: Norwegian minelayer/command ship , Norwegian minesweeper , Dutch minehunter , Belgian minehunter , Type 23 frigate and German minesweeper .

She was decommissioned in 2001 before being refitted for use as a training ship at the Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. In keeping with tradition, for this role the ship has been renamed &quot;Hindostan&quot;. As she is not a commissioned ship she is not prefixed &quot;HMS&quot;. In June 2023, she was towed to Portsmouth reportedly for temporary berthing while jetties at Britannia Royal Naval College were refurbished.

<text>Peter Metcalfe Hounam (born 1944) is a British journalist who has worked for &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, and BBC Television, as well as having published several books. In 1996, Hounam founded Vision Paperbacks, of which he is the chairman.

* &quot;The Woman from Mossad: The Torment of Mordechai Vanunu&quot;. paperback edition title: &quot;The Woman from Mossad: The Story of Mordechai Vanunu &amp; the Israeli Nuclear Program&quot;

==Mordechai Vanunu Case==
He is most famous for his role in the case of Mordechai Vanunu, Israeli nuclear technician who revealed Israel&#x27;s secret nuclear bomb programme. Hounam&#x27;s interview with Vanunu appeared in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in 1986.

In April 2004, Hounam traveled to Israel for Vanunu&#x27;s release from prison on 21 April 2004. Vanunu had spent 18 years in Israeli jails, following his abduction from England (via Italy) by the Mossad in 1986.

==USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident==
Hounam helped produce the 2002 BBC documentary &quot;Dead in the Water&quot;, which delves into the background of the 1967 Israeli attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot;. The documentary suggests that the attack was a deliberately-staged false flag operation meant to catapult the United States into the ongoing Six-Day War on Israel’s side by sinking the &quot;Liberty&quot; and blaming the attack on Egypt. Interviews include former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, former CIA Director Richard Helms, former head of the Israeli Navy Admiral Shlomo Errell, and many USS &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors, including Captain William L. McGonagle.

Hounam continued to research the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident, which culminated in the 2003 publishing of the book &quot;Operation Cyanide: Why the Bombing of the USS Liberty Nearly Caused World War III&quot;, which expands on the false flag theory.

Hounam also appeared in the 2020 docuseries &quot;Sacrificing Liberty&quot;, produced by &quot;TruNews&quot;, which features extensive interviews from USS &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors.

==Arrest in Jerusalem==

At 9.30pm on 26 May 2004, while working on a BBC documentary about Vanunu, Hounam was taken from his hotel in Jerusalem by five plainclothes Shin Bet officers, reportedly for having contact with Vanunu, who is not allowed to see foreigners. Before being taken, Hounam was able to inform an Amnesty International activist of his arrest, but did not get access to a lawyer.

On 27 May 2004, the Jerusalem District Court imposed a gag order, preventing further details of the arrest from becoming known. Hounam was scheduled to make a court appearance, as the security services request permission from the courts to continue holding him.

Reportedly, on 22 May 2004, Vanunu was secretly interviewed for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, by Yael Lotan, an Israeli journalist. Her two-hour interview was videotaped by an Israeli television crew. Hounam apparently knew of the interview, and was planning to use portions of it in his documentary. He had been on his way to meet Lotan when he was arrested.

Hounam&#x27;s wife, Hilarie, disputed the allegations that her husband violated the conditions placed upon Vanunu&#x27;s release. Speaking from the family&#x27;s home in the Scottish town of Aberfeldy she said: &quot;Peter has been absolutely scrupulous in following the letter of the regulations. He hasn&#x27;t talked to him [Vanunu] since the day of his release, and everything has had to be done second- or third-hand, through his brother and through lawyers.&quot; She added: &quot;I think the secret services can pretty much do what they like in Israel, and this is of no surprise to Peter – he&#x27;s known Israel well for 18 years and has been following Vanunu&#x27;s case all that time.&quot;

Hounam was detained for a day, during which the case attracted intense media coverage, and after which he was released without charge. Israeli Attorney General Menachem Mazuz ordered his release, after consulting with Shin Bet officials and representatives of the Israeli Justice Ministry. Hounam returned to the UK on 28 May 2004, and the BBC announced it would broadcast the Vanunu interview the following Sunday.

<text>In cryptography, MMB (Modular Multiplication-based Block cipher) is a block cipher designed by Joan Daemen as an improved replacement for the IDEA cipher. Modular multiplication is the central element in the design. Weaknesses in the key schedule were identified by Eli Biham, and this, together with the cipher&#x27;s not having been designed to resist linear cryptanalysis, meant that other designs were pursued instead, such as 3-Way.

MMB has a key size and block size of 128 bits.

<text>Keysigning is the process of digitally signing someone else&#x27;s public key using one&#x27;s own.
A more correct term would be [[digital certificate|certificate]] signing, since the actual key material is not changed by the process of signing. However, in the PGP community it is customary not to distinguish in speaking between someone&#x27;s key and certificate, and the term keysigning is used. (The term PGP refers here to all implementations of the OpenPGP standard, such as GnuPG.)

Users of PGP sign one another&#x27;s keys to indicate to any third party that the signer trusts the signee. This enables someone who trusts the signer to extend her trust to the signee as well. In this way, a web of trust is built.

PGP users often organize key signing parties, where many people meet in person to verify each other&#x27;s identity using some printed certificate of identity and then sign each other&#x27;s keys.

<doc id="682816" wikidata="Q58094" url="?curid=682816" title="Royal Hillsborough">
<text>Royal Hillsborough (Irish: &quot;Cromghlinn&quot;, meaning &#x27;Crooked Glen&#x27;), more commonly known simply as Hillsborough, is a village and civil parish in County Down, Northern Ireland, from the city of Belfast. It is within the Lisburn and Castlereagh District Council area. The village is noted for its Georgian architecture. It is home to Hillsborough Castle, the British royal family&#x27;s official residence in Northern Ireland, and residence of the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

==History==
Before 1661, the townland was known as &quot;Crumlin&quot; or &quot;Cromlin&quot; (). By 1661, during the Plantation of Ulster, the townland and the settlement within it had been renamed &quot;Hillsborough&quot;. It was named after English army officer Sir Moses Hill, and his son Sir Arthur Hill, who built Hillsborough Fort in 1650 to command the road from Dublin to Carrickfergus. The Hill family became the Earls of Hillsborough, then Marquesses of Downshire.

The mansion known as Hillsborough Castle was built in 1770 for The 1st Earl of Hillsborough (he was later created The 1st Marquess of Downshire, in 1789).

A prominent memorial to The 3rd Marquess of Downshire (1788–1845)—closely resembling Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square, London—stands to the south of the village and is visible throughout much of the surrounding area.

In 2007, Hillsborough won 3rd place in the annual Ulster in Bloom competition in the large village category.

In 2021, it was announced that letters patent would be issued granting the village the prefix &quot;Royal&quot;, thus officially becoming &quot;Royal Hillsborough&quot;, in recognition of Hillsborough Castle, the official royal residence for Northern Ireland. The Letters Patent came into effect on 20 October that year.

==Governance==
Hillsborough was within Lisburn City Council until 1 April 2015, when it formed part of the new Lisburn and Castlereagh District Council. Royal Hillsborough is located within the Westminster constituency of Lagan Valley and Northern Ireland Assembly constituency of Lagan Valley.

==Demography==
On Census day (27 March 2011) there were 3,952 people living in Hillsborough and Culcavy. Of these:
*17.1% were aged under 16 years and 20.6% were aged 65 and over
*48.4% of the population were male and 51.6% were female
*81.6% were from a Protestant or other Christian background, and 9.8% were from a Catholic background
*3.1% of people aged 16–74 were unemployed

==Places of interest==

*Hillsborough Castle is a two-storey Georgian mansion, and served as Government House from 1924 until 1973. It remains the official residence of King Charles III (and other Royal Family members) when visiting Northern Ireland. It has also been the official residence of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland since 1973. Hillsborough Castle was the venue for the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair stayed at the castle on many occasions during negotiations related to the peace process, and he hosted President George W. Bush at the castle for a one night visit in 2003.
*Hillsborough Fort
*Hillsborough Forest Park and Lake forms the picturesque setting for the original fort residence of Lord Hillsborough. 
*Hillsborough hosts an International Oyster Festival each year, usually in September. This attracts thousands of visitors. The festivities include boat racing, parachuting, garden fêtes, oyster eating and Guinness drinking.

*The historic Parish Church dedicated to Saint Malachy is one of the finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture. It was built for The 1st Earl of Hillsborough between 1760 and 1774, in the hope that the church would become the cathedral of the Church of Ireland Diocese of Down and Connor. In addition to its imposing setting, it boasts two 18th century organs, a peal of ten bells and a number of works by notable craftsmen of the era, including the Colours of the County Down Battalion of Carson&#x27;s Ulster Volunteers. Today it is a parish in the Church of Ireland Diocese of Down and Dromore.

==Notable people==
*The composer and conductor Sir Hamilton Harty (1879–1941), whose father William Harty was organist in St. Malachy&#x27;s Parish Church, was born in Hillsborough.
*Hillsborough was home to TV and radio presenter Gloria Hunniford for a number of years. Her late daughter Caron Keating spent much of her childhood in the village.
*Frank Pantridge (1916–2004) was a physician and cardiologist born in Hillsborough, who invented the portable defibrillator.
*Richard Lyons (born 1979), racing driver and Formula Nippon champion

==Railways==

Hillsborough railway station was opened by the Banbridge, Lisburn and Belfast Railway on 13 July 1863. 
The line through the station was part of the Great Northern Railway (Ireland).
The station closed on 30 April 1956 under the auspices of the Great Northern Railway Board. Train services were replaced by bus services provided by the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA). No trace of the station now remains, as it was removed when the dual carriageway was built. It was situated where this crosses over the Culcavey Road.

==Sport==
*In 2005 Lisnagarvey Hockey Club relocated from their Blaris ground to the outskirts of Hillsborough.
*Downshire Young Men F.C.

<text>Josiah Harlan, Prince of Ghor (June 12, 1799 – October 1871) was an American adventurer who travelled to Afghanistan and Punjab with the intention of making himself a king. During his travels, he became involved in local politics and factional military actions. He claimed he was awarded the title &quot;Prince of Ghor&quot; in exchange for military aid. Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; is believed to have been partly based on Harlan.

==Harlan&#x27;s childhood==
Harlan was born in Newlin Township, in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Harlan and his nine siblings—including paleontologist Richard Harlan—were raised in a strict and pious home by Quakers. His father was a merchant broker in Philadelphia.

After the death of his mother when he was 13-years-old, Harlan took up reading. It was recorded that at the age of 15, he was reading medical books, such as the biographies of Plutarch. He also allegedly held interest in advanced religious texts. Harlan had a knack for languages, as he was able to speak French fluently and could read in both Greek and Latin. Furthermore, he enjoyed studying Greek and Roman ancient history, with Alexander the Great bearing a particular point of interest for him.

==Early travels==
In 1820, Harlan embarked on his first travels after joining the Freemasons. His father secured him a job as a supercargo on a merchant ship bound for Asia, sailing from Calcutta, India to Guangzhou, China and back. After his return, he fell in love with Elizabeth Swaim, for whom he wrote several verses of poetry. Soon after, they got engaged and planned to marry after he returned from the voyage to India and China. However, after his fiancée married someone else, Harlan vowed to never return to America and used the word &quot;solitude&quot; several times in his writings. 

In July 1824, he enlisted as a military surgeon with the East India Company, despite his lack of medical training. The company was about to enter the war in Burma and needed surgeons. Relying on self-study and some practice while at sea, Harlan presented himself to the medical board for examination and was hired as a surgeon in the Calcutta general hospital. In January 1825, he served with the army in Burma. Harlan admired the impressive capacity of the East India Company&#x27;s sepoys, who &quot;consumed nothing but parched grain, a leguminous seed resembling the pea&quot;, and yet kept going. Owing to heavy losses due to disease and war, Harlan sometimes fought with the Bengal Artillery, acquiring military knowledge that would be used in future exploits. Harlan claimed he was at the Battle of Prome in 1825, where Anglo-Indian forces stormed the city of Prome (modern Pyay) and engaged in fierce hand-to-hand fighting with the Burmese. The Treaty of Yandabo in 1826 ended hostilities.

Once recuperated, Harlan was posted to Karnal, north of Delhi. There, he read the 1815 book: &quot;An Account of the Kingdom of Caubul, and its dependencies in Persia, Tartary and India, comprising a View of the Afghan Nation and history of the Dooraunee Monarchy.&quot; This book was written by Mountstuart Elphinstone, who was then a civil servant with the East India Company, and had visited Durrani Empire in 1809. While visiting that empire, Elphinstone met the country&#x27;s king Shuja Durrani, a monarch who wore the Koh-i-Noor (&quot;Mountain of Light&quot;) diamond on his left arm and was later deposed by his half-brother Mahmud Durrani during Elphinstone&#x27;s visit.

To many Westerners at that time, Afghanistan seemed remote and mysterious. Elphinstone&#x27;s book described a nation that no Westerner had ever before visited, which quickly became a bestseller. Harlan dreamed of a medieval Afghanistan, where tribal chiefs battled for supremacy.

Harlan was a strict disciplinarian who would not tolerate any insubordination from those serving under him. But he himself had difficulty taking orders and was openly insubordinate towards his superiors. Harlan began to learn Hindi and Persian. In the summer of 1826, he quit his service with the East India Company. As a civilian, he was granted a permit to stay in India by the Governor-General Lord Amherst. According to his writings about this time Harlan decided to travel to Punjab, which was then beyond the realm of British rule.

==Entering Afghanistan==
After a stay in Shimla, Harlan came to Ludhiana, a border outpost of the British East India Company on the river Sutlej, which formed the border between the Sikh Empire and British India at the time. Harlan had decided to enter the service of Ranjit Singh, the Maharaja of Punjab. Ranjit Singh was willing to hire Westerners who could be useful to him, but generally did not allow them to enter Punjab. He knew that the East India Company possessed much of the Indian subcontinent, and as far as he was concerned, the less known of Punjab the better. So, Punjab became a rather mysterious region for Westerners. The East India Company&#x27;s agent in Ludhiana, Captain Claude Martin Wade, described Harlan as an enigmatic character who dressed well, knew much about the flora of India and the classics, and wanted to become a mercenary for Ranjit Singh. This made him the first classicist/botanist/soldier of fortune that Wade had ever met. Harlan planned to study the flora of the Punjab, which was unknown in the West, and publish a book about the botany of Punjab with a special emphasis on flowers.

While awaiting an answer to his request to enter Punjab, Harlan heard that the deposed King of Afghanistan lived in exile in Ludhiana. According to rumor, he was fabulously wealthy, and Harlan decided to enlist in his service, sending him a letter offering &quot;a general proposition affecting the royal prospects of restoration&quot;. At Shah Shujah Durrani&#x27;s palace, Harlan discovered a court of grotesquely deformed men. Shuja had a habit of removing the ears, noses, tongues, and genitalia of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him, and they all offended him at some point. Harlan commented Shuja&#x27;s court was an &quot;earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king&#x27;s service&quot;. Harlan spoke no Pashto and Shuja no English, so they conversed in a mixture of Hindi and Persian. Harlan praised &quot;the grace and dignity of His Highness&#x27;s demeanor&quot;, observing the sense of power that Shuja projected, but also that &quot;years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation&quot;. When Shuja went out for a picnic with his wives, a gust of wind blew down his tent, and Shuja became enraged. Much to Harlan&#x27;s horror, Shuja had his chief slave, an African named Khwajah Mika who had arrived in India via the slave markets of Zanzibar, castrated on the spot.

Shuja agreed to hire Harlan, and Harlan had a tailor in Ludhiana sew an American flag, which he used to imply that he was working for the U.S. government, as he went about recruiting mercenaries to restore Shuja. By the fall of 1827, Harlan had recruited about 100 mercenaries, a mixture of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs interested in loot and plunder.

Writing about Afghanistan&#x27;s unstable politics, its frequently overthrown rulers, and the penchant for sons to conspire against their fathers, and brothers against brothers, Harlan noted: &quot;The prize was literally handed about like a shuttlecock. The king who in the battle may have dispatched a favorite son in the command of his army would probably before night find himself flying from his own troops.&quot; Afghanistan was dominated by a feud between two families, the Durrani and the Barakzai, and furthermore, the men of the Durrani and Barakzai families were just as much inclined to feud with other family members as they were with the rival families. Shuja, who belonged to the Durrani family, had together with his brother Mahmud overthrown and blinded their brother Zaman. Shuja then deposed Mahmud and was overthrown by Mahmud, who in his turn was overthrown by the Barakzai brothers after he had their father Fateh Khan publicly chopped to pieces. In turn the Barazkais were now feuding among themselves. 72 Barakzai half-brothers now ruled Afghanistan. Muslim traditions of polygamy allowed a man to have four wives at once, and an unlimited number of concubines, so their father had a surplus of sons. Given this history, and the fact that Afghan tribal chiefs tended to be loyal only to those who paid them the most, Harlan believed that despite the small size of his force that he could topple the Emir, Dost Mohammad Khan, who was the most able and intelligent of the fractious Barakzai brothers.

With financial support from Shuja Shah Durrani, Harlan travelled along the Indus and into Afghanistan, first to Peshawar then to Kabul. During his journey, Harlan discovered in Ahmedpur two deserters from the East India Company&#x27;s army, James Lewis, better known by his pseudonym Charles Masson and Richard Porter aka &quot;John Brown&quot;, who tried to persuade him that they were Americans, but Harlan couldn&#x27;t help but notice their English accents. Harlan correctly guessed that the only reason why two Englishmen out in the wildness would try to pass themselves off as Americans was that they were deserters. The two deserters joined Harlan&#x27;s army and maintained the pretense of being two gentlemen from Kentucky who had decided to explore the Hindu Kush. As he entered Afghanistan, Harlan first met the warlike Pashtun tribes and learned about their strict code of &quot;Pashtunwali&quot; (&quot;the way of the Pashtuns&quot;) under which any insult, real or perceived, had to be avenged with swift and blinding violence while at the same time, a man had to be courteous and honorable to all, including his enemies. As Harlan&#x27;s army was close to mutiny, he decided he would enter Afghanistan disguised as a Muslim &quot;dervish&quot; (holy man) returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca. Much to Harlan&#x27;s fury, Masson deserted his army and inspired several others to follow his example. Harlan knew only a few phrases in Arabic, but with these he convinced a Pashtun chief that he was a &quot;dervish&quot; returning from Mecca. Shuja followed Harlan&#x27;s force with his own troop of mercenaries, seizing Peshawar, the summer capital of Afghanistan. He behaved with such arrogance towards the Pashtun chiefs who had come to swear loyalty to him, expecting lavish financial rewards, that they went back to the Bazakzai brothers, who did not use court etiquette to humiliate them as Shuja had done.

Harlan met the man who he had come to depose in Kabul, Dost Mohammad Khan, at Bala Hisar Fort. The custom of &quot;Pashtunwali&quot; ensured that Dost Mohammad would choose to treat Harlan as an honored guest. By this time, Harlan had become fluent in Persian, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Muslim world, and it was in that language that he and Dost Mohammad talked. Even through Harlan had come to Afghanistan to overthrow Dost Mohammad, upon meeting him, he discovered he rather admired him. Unlike the rulers from the House of Durrani, who used the title of &quot;Shah&quot; (Persian for king), the monarchs of the House of Bazakzai used the less grand title of &quot;Emir&quot; (Arabic for prince). Pashto had such low status in the Muslim world that both the Durranis and Barakzais used Arabic and Persian titles to improve their prestige. Harlan had arrived assuming the West was superior to the East, but meeting Dost Mohammad challenged his thinking, as he found Easterners could be just as intelligent as Westerners. When Dost Mohammad asked Harlan to explain the American system of government to him, Harlan spoke about the tripartite separation of powers between the President, Congress, and the Supreme Court. The Emir remarked the American system did not sound much different from the Afghan system, where there was a tripartite separation of powers between the Emir, the tribal chiefs, and the &quot;Ulama&quot; (Islamic clergy who also served as judges). Harlan noted that although a Muslim, Dost Mohammad drank heavily and had brought prostitutes to his court; Harlan described them as &quot;promiscuous actors in the wild, voluptuous, licentious scene of shameless bacchanals&quot;.

Harlan explored Kabul, the &quot;city of ten thousand gardens&quot;, observing that there were so many gardens in the city full of sweet-smelling flowers and fruits they almost covered the smell of human and animal excrement dumped in the streets. Harlan wrote Kabul was a &quot;jewel encircled with emerald with flowers and blossoms whose odors perfume the air with a fragrance elsewhere unknown&quot;. Harlan called Kabul a &quot;sweet assemblage of floral beauty&quot; full of &quot;ornamental trees, apple orchards, patches of peach and plum trees, vast numbers of mulberry of various species, black, white and purple, with the sycamore, the tall poplar, the sweet scented and the red and white willows, the weeping willow, green meadows, running streams and hedges of roses, red, white, yellow and variegated&quot;.

Harlan observed that Kabul had a lively red-light district full of &quot;professional courtesans [sic] or female singers and dancers, libidinous creatures whose lives are passed in the immodest and secret intrigues of licentiousness&quot;. Macintyre wrote that Harlan&#x27;s disapproving tone suggested considerable experience of the red-light district of Kabul.

A difficult moment for Harlan emerged when Hajji Khan, a mercenary working for Dost Mohammad, approached him with a plan to assassinate the Emir and restore Shuja to the throne. Harlan was uncertain if Khan was working as an agent provocateur sent by Dost Mohammad to test his loyalty (meaning he would be executed if he agreed to the plot) or was sincere (meaning he would kill Harlan if he refused to join the plot). Harlan suggested that the two should go off and invade the Sindh together; when Khan persisted, Harlan said he could never violate the rules of &quot;Pashtunwali&quot; by conspiring to murder his host, at which point Khan told him that the Emir extended him his thanks for his willingness to observe &quot;Pashtunwali&quot;. Shortly afterwards, a cholera epidemic hit Kabul, killing off much of the population, owing to the feces-ridden water of Kabul. Harlan was infected with cholera and wandered into a mosque one night which was a morgue full of the bodies of cholera victims. As Harlan left the mosque, he tripped over bodies piled up in the streets. At that point, an anonymous man told Harlan that the only cure for cholera was to drink alcohol, saying if one consumed enough alcohol that cholera could be survived. Harlan was raised a teetotaler, but to survive cholera he broke with his Quaker values by drinking as much as possible of the wine and whisky smuggled into Afghanistan from India. An attack of cholera typically lasts 48 hours, during which the body excretes fluids, causing intense dehydration leading to death, which can be countered by consuming enough fluids such as alcohol which are not infected. After surviving cholera, Harlan later stated he looked death in the eye, and was never again afraid of death.

In Peshawar, Harlan had met a &quot;Nawab&quot; Jubbar Khan, who was a brother of Dost Mohammad Khan. Jubbar Khan was important as a possible rival of Dost Mohammad, and thus a possible ally to Shuja Shah. During this time, Harlan met an Afghan &quot;maulvi&quot; (Islamic scholar) who also worked as an alchemist and doctor, whose name no-one knew and whom Harlan called &quot;the Moolvie&quot;. Harlan discovered much to his amazement that the &quot;maulvi &quot;&quot;was an enthusiastic Rosicrucian&quot; who was seeking the Philosopher&#x27;s stone, and who kept Jubbar Khan happy with the supposed medical secrets that his occult knowledge gave him. Harlan soon discovered that the &quot;maulvi&quot; was a fraud, who once insisted that his alchemy could only work if he was provided with a large number of unusually large fish from a local river; when after much difficulty the requisite number of big fish were caught, the &quot;maulvi&quot; only then &quot;remembered&quot; that they all had to be of the same sex for his alchemy to work, at which point the fishing season had passed. Harlan often argued with the &quot;maulvi&quot;, telling him about that modern chemist in the West had firmly established it was not possible to turn lead into gold, much less turn fish into silver, as he insisted that he could. While staying with Jabbar Khan, Harlan evaluated the situation and realized that Dost Muhammad&#x27;s position was too strong, and that influence from outside Afghanistan was needed. He decided to seek his luck in Punjab. Upon his return to the Punjab, Wade admitted to Harlan that Shuja would never be restored to the throne of Afghanistan, saying: &quot;There is now no possible chance for Shuja&#x27;s restoration, unless an ostensible demonstration of Russian diplomacy should transpire in Kabul.&quot; Wade&#x27;s reference to &quot;Russian diplomacy&quot; in Kabul was Harlan&#x27;s initiation into the struggle for influence in Central Asia between Russia and Britain known to the British as the Great Game and to the Russians as the &quot;Tournament of Shadows&quot;.

==Maharaja Ranjit Singh==
Harlan came to Lahore, the capital of Punjab, in 1829. He sought out the French general Jean-François Allard, who introduced him to the Maharaja. Allard had been awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; by Napoleon and was the Western officer that Ranjit Singh trusted the most.

Ranjit Singh, the &quot;Lion of Lahore&quot; had conquered much of what is today north-western India and Pakistan and was considered to be one of the most powerful rulers in the Indian subcontinent, which is why Harlan sought to work in his service. As a rule, Ranjit Singh was against taking anybody British into his service as he held deep suspicions of the Company and mistrusted the loyalties of the few Britons in his service. His European such as French and Italian officers were part of the Dal Khalsa army, which was one of the most formidable military machines in Asia. Their contribution to the empire was well rewarded. As a result, Ranjit Singh paid his Western officers well and Harlan noted that Allard lived in a grand mansion, which he called &quot;a miniature Versailles in the midst of an Oriental bazaar&quot;.

Allard was lonely in the Punjab, unable to relate to the Indians, and was known to welcome any Westerner. He received Harlan as a guest, warning him &quot;It is a very difficult to get an appointment here, but still more to get one&#x27;s dismissal, when once in office&quot;. Allard wrote a poem calling himself a happy &quot;slave&quot; of Ranjit Singh because he wanted to visit his homeland, France, with his Kashmiri wife, and Ranjit Singh had initially refused him permission to leave, thus requiring an obsequious poem to being allowed a visit home. Allard introduced Harlan to Ranjit Singh, dressed all in white with a matching white turban, who proudly wore the Koh-i-Noor diamond (which he had taken from Shuja) and radiated an aura of power. As Harlan knew no Punjabi, he spoke to Singh in Hindi.

Harlan was offered a military position but declined, looking for something more lucrative. This he eventually found: after lingering at the court for some time he was offered the position of Governor of Gujrat District, a position he accepted. Ranjit Singh told Harlan, &quot;I will make you Governor of Gujrat and give you rupees a month. If you behave well, I will increase your salary. If not, I will cut off your nose&quot;. Before giving him this position, however, the Maharaja decided to test Harlan. In December 1829, he was instated as Governor of Nurpur and Jasrota, described by Harlan himself as &quot;two districts then newly subjugated by the King in Lahore, located on the skirt of the Himalah mountains&quot;. These districts had been seized by the maharajah of the Punjab in 1816 and were fairly wealthy at the time Harlan arrived. Little, if anything, is known of Harlan&#x27;s tenure there, but he must have fared well. One visitor noted that given Ranjit Singh&#x27;s habit of cutting off the noses of those who failed him that &quot;The fact of his nose being entire, proved that he has done well&quot;. In May 1832 he was transferred to Gujrat. In Gujrat, Harlan was visited soon after his instatement by Henry Lawrence who later described him as &quot;a man of considerable ability, great courage and enterprise, and judging by appearance, well cut out for partisan work&quot;. Harlan later wrote &quot;I was both civil and military governor&quot; with unlimited powers to do whatever he pleased as long as taxes were collected, and order maintained. While serving the durbar, Harlan often encountered the Akalis, militant and heavily armed Sikh fundamentalists, who Harlan noted were seen &quot;riding about with sword drawn in each hand, two more in the belt, a matchlock at the back and then a pair of quoits fastened around the turban-an arm peculiar to this race of people, it is a steel ring, ranging from six to nine inches in diameter, and about an inch in breath, very thin, and at the edges very sharp; they are said to throw it with such accuracy and force as to be able to lop off a limb at sixty or eighty yards&quot;. The weapon that Harlan described as a &quot;quoit&quot; is better known as the chakram.

One of Harlan&#x27;s visitors was the Reverend Joseph Wolff, a Bavarian Jew who had converted successively to Catholicism, Lutheranism and finally Anglicanism, and was now traveling all over Asia as a missionary. After being ordained a minister at Cambridge, Reverend Wolff had set off to Asia to find the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel and covert all the peoples of Asia to the Church of England. Wolff had arrived at Gujrat and asked to see the governor, expecting him to be a Sikh &quot;sardar&quot; (nobleman) and was surprised that the governor was whistling Yankee Doodle Dandy and he introduced himself as: &quot;I am a free citizen of the United States, from the state of Pennsylvania, city of Philadelphia. I am the son of a Quaker. My name is Josiah Harlan&quot;. Wolff said Harlan wore a very expensive Western suit and liked to smoke a hookah. Wolff was one of the few people with whom Harlan spoke of his love for Swaim, as Wolff wrote in his journal: &quot;He fell in love with a young lady who promised to marry him. He sailed to Calcutta; but hearing that his betrothed lady had married somebody else, he determined never again to return to America&quot;. Harlan also confessed to Wolff his dream of ruling Afghanistan, and Wolff noted: &quot;He speaks and write Persian with great fluency; he is clever and enterprising. Dr. Harlan is a high Tory in principles, and honors kingly dignity; though on the other hand he speaks with enthusiasm of Washington, Adams and Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence&quot;.

While European governors were rare, Harlan was certainly not the only one. His colleague Paolo Avitabile was made governor of Wazirabad, and Jean-Baptiste Ventura was made governor of Dera Ghazi Khan in 1831. Avitabile once had a group portrait done of all the Westerners in Ranjit Singh&#x27;s service, which depicted him, Allard, Ventura, Claude Auguste Court, and Harlan all standing together. Unlike Ventura and even more so Avitabile, who believed that violence was the only language Indians were capable of understanding and who terrorized their provinces, Harlan attempted to crack down on corruption and avoided brutality, which caused his relations with Ventura and Avitabile to decline. Harlan was also in turn followed in his position in Gujrat by an Englishman named Holmes, who failed Singh, and lost more than his nose, being publicly beheaded as an example of the fate of those who failed the Maharajah. During his time as governor of Gujrat, Harlan&#x27;s principal friend was the &quot;maulvi, as&quot; the alchemist from Afghanistan unexpectedly showed up at his palace one day. The &quot;maulvi&quot; taught Harlan about &quot;the traditional lore of Arabia&quot; while the alchemist wanted Harlan to sponsor him to join a Masonic lodge as Harlan noted &quot;My refusal to explain the craft of Freemasonry added to his conviction that in the secrecy of that forbidden region of science lay the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;.

Joining Harlan in Gujrat was the American adventurer Alexander Gardner who had come down from Central Asia, looking for employment with Singh and arrived at Harlan&#x27;s palace to seek the company of a fellow American. Gardner, who claimed to have been born in a fur-trading post on Lake Superior in what is now Wisconsin to a Scots father and an Anglo-Spanish mother in 1785, was always very proud of his Scottish heritage. Gardner wore a turban and Asian-style clothing in a tartan print, a colorful reminder of his Scots heritage, as Gardner was insistently Scottish-American in his identity during his various adventures as a mercenary in Central Asia, where he had fled after deserting from the Imperial Russian Army in 1819. Gardner claimed that during his childhood on the shores of Lake Superior the Ojibwe Indians had taught him how to fight. Whether or not this was true, Gardner was a fighter, his body was covered with wounds, most notably a gaping hole in his throat that required him to wear a neck-brace to drink. Gardner told Harlan that he and his followers &quot;... did not slaughter except in self-defense&quot; during his time in Central Asia. While fighting against Dost Mohammad in the pay of the warlord Habibullah Khan, Gardner&#x27;s wife and his infant daughter had been killed by the Emir&#x27;s forces after being captured, causing him to head to the Punjab. Gardner, who was known as &quot;Gordana Khan&quot; in Central Asia, recalled: &quot;I remained a few days with Dr. Harlan and on meeting my countryman, I resumed the character of a foreigner, and resumed also the name of Gardner, which I abandoned for so long that it sounded strangely in my ears&quot;.

In 1834, the Sikh general Hari Singh Nalwa finally captured the contested city of Peshawar for the Punjab, leading Dost Mohammad Khan, the Emir of Afghanistan, to send the Maharajah an insulting letter demanding the return of Peshawar or else face war, leading Ranjit Singh to reply with an equally insulting letter challenging Dost Mohammad to retake Peshawar if he dared. In the spring of 1835, Dost Mohammad, anxious to regain Peshawar, declared &quot;jihad&quot; on the Punjab. The traditional hatred between the Sikhs and Afghans meant there was no shortage of volunteers in Afghanistan to go kill Sikhs, and a huge number of tribesmen rallied to Dost Mohammad&#x27;s banner. Macintyre noted the Afghans had a &quot;fanatical&quot; hatred of the Sikhs, which to a certain extent compensated for the superior training and firepower of the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot;. As the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; faced off against the Afghans, the no-man&#x27;s land between the two armies was soon littered with corpses as tribesmen from the Pashtun Ghazi tribe faced off in skirmishes against the Akali. Gardner observed &quot;the Sikhs sadly lost many lives at the merciless hands of the Ghazis, who, each with his little green Moslem flag, boldly pressed on, freely and fairly courting death and martyrdom&quot;. The Akali were equally enthusiastic in using their quoits to cut down Ghazis.

Ranjit Singh, knowing that the feuding Barakzai brothers were as much inclined to fight among themselves as against their enemies and that Harlan knew the Barakzai brothers, ordered him up to the front to see if he could divide the Afghan leaders. The Emir&#x27;s half-brother Sultan Mohammad Khan had fallen in love with a dancing girl at the court, whom he was planning to take into his harem to make into another of his concubines, but Dost Mohammad who also desired her, had used his right as Emir to take her into his harem, causing much discord between the Barakzai brothers, which Harlan knew about. Viewing the Afghan camp outside of Peshawar, Harlan reported seeing: &quot;Fifty thousand belligerent candidates for martyrdom and immortality. Savages from the remotest recesses of the mountainous districts, many of them giants in form and strength, promiscuously armed with sword and shield, bow and arrows, matchlocks, rifles, spears and blunderbusses, concentrated themselves around the standard of religion, and were prepared to slay, plunder and destroy, for the sake of Allah and the Prophet, the unenlightened infidels of the Punjab&quot;. &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; was a powerful army, but Ranjit Singh as usual preferred to achieve his goals via diplomacy rather than war if possible, and so sought to find a peaceful way to send the Afghans home.

Under the flag of truce, Harlan went to the camp of Sultan Mohammad Khan, the half-brother of the Emir, to negotiate the right price for defecting, and he was motivated by his resentment of Dost Mohammad for taking away the dancing girl he desired to turn him against the Emir. Already, many Sikhs and Afghans, anxious to spill each other&#x27;s blood, had engaged in skirmishes and the ground between the two armies that Harlan traveled through was littered with corpses. Harlan offered Sultan Mohammad a generous bribe on the behalf of Ranjit Singh in exchange for going home with that part of the Afghan host under his command. Dost Mohammad had heard that Harlan had arrived in his half-brother&#x27;s camp. But he then received a letter from Sultan Mohammad Khan &quot;stating the fact of Mr. Harlan&#x27;s arrival, and that he had been put to death, while his elephants and plunder had been made booty&quot;. The news was received with loud cheering in Dost Mohammad&#x27;s camp, and it was announced that &quot;now the brothers had become one and wiped away their enmities in &quot;Feringhi&quot; blood&quot;. After agreeing to consider whether to accept Singh&#x27;s bribe, Harlan and Sultan Mohammad Khan rode into Dost Mohammad&#x27;s camp, where Harlan told the Emir to go home, telling him that despite his 50,000 men that &quot;If the Prince of the Punjab chose to assemble the militia of his dominions, he could bring ten times that number into the field, but you will have regular troops to fight, and your &quot;sans-culottes&quot; militia will vanish like mist before the sun&quot;. Dost Mohammad then made a veiled threat to kill Harlan, reminding Harlan that when &quot;Secunder&quot; (Alexander the Great) had fought in Afghanistan one of his envoys had been killed under the flag of truce. A servant brought in some &quot;doug&quot; (fermented milk) to drink, which Sultan Mohammad refused to drink, believing his half-brother was attempting to poison him. When Dost Mohammad insisted that Sultan Mohammad drink some of the &quot;doug&quot; under the grounds it was rude to refuse his hospitality, his half-brother insisted that the Emir drink some of the &quot;doug&quot; first, which he refused under the grounds it&#x27;s too hot of a day to drink a &quot;doug&quot;, leading to a lengthy argument between the two about who was drink the &quot;doug&quot; first. Dost Mohammad finally drank some of the &quot;doug&quot; just to prove it was not poisoned. Dost Mohammad had played a cunning trick on his half-brother as the reluctance of Sultan Mohammad to drink the &quot;doug&quot; first proved to the assembled tribal chiefs that he had been engaging in treachery, as Dost Mohammad had intended. The meeting was first of several tense meetings as Harlan traveled back and forth between the Sikh camp and the two half-brothers before Sultan Mohammad was finally bribed into switching sides while Ranjit Singh had brought up his heavy artillery, which finally persuaded Dost Mohammad that discretion was the better part of valor, leading him to go home. Harlan had played the role of a diplomat well, seeing off an Afghan invasion with minimal losses to the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot;; but Ranjit Singh decided after the fact that it would have better to have given battle after all, and publicly criticized Harlan for preventing a battle that he believed he could have won, the beginning of a rift between the two.

On August 19, 1835, Ranjit Singh had a stroke, which left him with slurred speech, and demanded that Harlan use his knowledge of Western medicine to cure him. In the 19th century it was widely believed that running electrical jolts through the body had restorative effects, and following Harlan&#x27;s advice, Ranjit Singh had the services of a British doctor, Dr. William McGregor, competent in the application of galvanism to his emaciated body should be placed at his disposal. Electrical machine was brought to Lahore to pump Ranjit Singh with electricity, an experience that did not restore his speech. The final blow to his relations with Ranjit Singh occurred when Ranjit Singh was informed that Harlan was secretly employing his time in his fortress in the practice of alchemy and transmutation of metals, where Harlan had the &quot;maulvi&quot; living with him who was alleged to be able to turn base metals into precious gold ones (refusing to share the knowledge was tantamount to treason) and that Harlan was allegedly minting counterfeit coins (a crime for which the penalty was death). In fear of his life, Harlan left Ranjit Singh&#x27;s employ in early 1836. An Indian historian Khushwant Singh called Harlan &quot;an incredible windbag&quot; who was somehow able to convince Ranjit Singh that he was a &quot;doctor, scholar, statesman and soldier&quot;.

==Afghanistan==
In 1836, after a falling-out with Ranjit Singh, Harlan defected over to the service of Dost Mohammad Khan, the Emir of Afghanistan and the archenemy of Singh. Even though Harlan, while in the service of Singh and Shah Shujah, had fought against Dost Mohammad in the past, the Emir was sufficiently impressed with Harlan&#x27;s ability to accept his former enemy into his service. In the treacherous world of Afghan politics, where today&#x27;s enemy was likely to be tomorrow&#x27;s friend, and today&#x27;s friend to be tomorrow&#x27;s enemy, Dost Mohammad had learned not to hold grudges. Arriving in Kabul, Harlan ran into Charles Masson who had deserted his earlier expedition to Afghanistan, an act that Harlan had not forgiven him for. Harlan sent a letter to the East India Company telling them that Masson, the &quot;American&quot; explorer and amateur archaeologist of Central Asia, was actually the Englishman James Lewis, a deserter from the Company&#x27;s army sentenced to death in absentia. Captain Wade used this information to blackmail Masson into working as a spy for the Company, promising him a pardon if he agreed to work as a spy, and to have him extradited back to India to be executed if he refused his offer. Masson was a most unwilling player in the &quot;Great Game&quot;, not the least because he knew Dost Mohammad would have him executed if he found out he was working as a spy for the Company. Masson, suspecting that it was Harlan who had denounced him to the Company, started denouncing him to the Company as a &quot;violent and unprincipled man&quot;.

In March 1836, Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India, received a letter in English purportedly from Dost Mohammad (who did not know English), whose flowery style and Americanisms strongly suggested that Harlan was the real author, asking him to sign an alliance and force Ranjit Singh to return Peshawar to Afghanistan. Writing as Dost Mohammad, Harlan declared: &quot;The field of my hopes, which had before been chilled by the cold blast of the wintry times, has by the happy tidings of your Lordship&#x27;s arrival become the envy of the Garden of Paradise&quot;, going on to ask the British to ensure &quot;the reckless and misguided Sikhs&quot; to return Peshawar to the Afghans. Lord Auckland replied: &quot;My friend, you are aware that it is not the practice of the British government to interfere with the affairs of the independent states&quot;.

Dost Mohammad wanted Harlan to train his tribal levy (Afghanistan had no army) to fight in the Western style of war. The French had traditionally excelled at artillery, and as befitting an army supported by French officers of the Sikh Empire, the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; had excellent artillery, which had been repeatedly used to decimate the Afghan tribesmen in various battles. Singh had been pushing steadily into the &quot;badlands&quot; on the modern border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but in 1837 he recalled the best of the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; for a parade to honor his son&#x27;s wedding in Lahore, which Dost Mohammad took advantage of by attacking the Sikhs. Under the banner of &quot;jihad&quot;, about 20,000 Afghan tribesmen swept down the Khyber Pass under the command of Dost Mohammad&#x27;s son Wazir Akbar Khan to attack the Sikhs, accompanied by Harlan as his special military adviser. On April 30, 1837, the Afghans battled the Sikhs at the Battle of Jamrud. At Jamrud, the Sikh artillery blasted holes in the Afghan ranks, with a single cannonball killing or wounding dozens of men, but when the Sikh infantry advanced through the gaps in the Afghan line, the Afghans, following Harlan&#x27;s advice, used their numerically superior reserves to crush the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; in furious hand-to-hand fighting. The Afghans lost about 1,000 killed while the Sikhs lost about 2,000 dead, including General Hari Singh Nalwa, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s favorite general. Harlan wrote that Singh must had been besides himself with fury, imagining that &quot;The proud King of Lahore quailed upon his threatened throne, as he exclaimed with terror and approaching despair, &#x27;Harlan has avenged himself, this is all his work&#x27;&quot;. Singh reacted by sending his best general, the French mercenary Jean-François Allard to avenge the death of his general, while the Afghans—unable to take the fortress of Peshawar—retreated back beyond the Khyber Pass, starting on May 9, 1837. Feeling his hold on Peshawar was weak, Singh appointed the Neapolitan mercenary General Paolo Avitabile the new governor of Peshawar with orders to terrorize the city into submission, using methods that Harlan called barbaric.

Harlan liked and admired Dost Mohammad, whom he called a hard-working, self-disciplined and efficient emir who always got up early every morning to pray towards Mecca and read the Koran before receiving tribal chiefs except on Thursday, which was the only day of the week that Dost Mohammad took a bath. After discussing the affairs of Afghanistan, Dost Mohammad would have his breakfast at 11 am, to be followed by new meetings before retiring to his harem to enjoy his concubines, to be followed by a ride around Kabul in the afternoon to hear the complaints of his subjects. After he turned thirty, Dost Mohammad ceased drinking and having orgies with prostitutes, becoming a more much pious Muslim than he had been when younger. Harlan noted that Dost Mohammad had &quot;shirrun i huzzoor&quot;, the Pashtun quality of modesty and politeness, but that he was also an &quot;exquisite dissembler&quot; capable of &quot;the most revolting cruelty&quot;, very greedy for gold, and extremely cynical, doubting every motive except for self-interest as a reason for a man&#x27;s actions. Harlan noted that Dost Mohammad was a hypocrite who denounced slavery as a great evil, but who owned slaves himself and did nothing to shut down the slave markets of Kabul, where Uzbek slavers were always bringing in Hazara slaves captured in their raids. Harlan observed that Dost Mohammad was stern in his rule as once he was presented with a man and a woman who had been captured when a &quot;nocturnal orgie&quot; had been discovered; the others had escaped, but this couple had been too drunk. Harlan observed that Dost Mohammad &quot;listened to the charges of licentiousness and immorality&quot;, and with a wave of his hand ordered the man&#x27;s beard to be burned off while the woman was to be put into a bag and given 40 lashes with a whip. When Harlan asked why the woman had to be put into a bag before whipping her, the Emir replied, &quot;To avoid the indecency of exposure&quot;. 
As part of the &quot;Great Game&quot; between Britain and Russia for influence in Central Asia, on September 20, 1837, Alexander Burnes, the Scotsman who had been appointed the East India Company&#x27;s agent in Kabul, arrived, and immediately became Harlan&#x27;s rival. Harlan wrote that Burnes was &quot;remarkable only for his obstinacy and stupidity&quot;. Together with the pseudo-American Charles Masson, Burnes and Harlan were the only westerners in Kabul, and all three men hated one another. In Afghanistan, the Emir was expected to reward loyal chiefs with gifts, which given the poverty of Afghanistan meant the Emirs expected equally lavish gifts from foreign ambassadors, and Harlan recorded that Dost Mohammad was greatly offended when the only gifts that Burnes brought with him were two pistols and a spyglass. Joining the three quarreling Westerners in Kabul in December 1837 was a Polish orientalist in Russian service, Count Jan Prosper Witkiewicz, who had arrived in Kabul as the representative of the emperor Nicholas I of Russia. With Witkiewicz&#x27;s arrival, the &quot;Great Game&quot; entered an intense new phase, and Burnes was visibly disconcerted by Witkiewicz&#x27;s presence in Kabul, believing Afghanistan was falling into the Russian sphere of influence. Burnes had Christmas dinner with Dost Mohammad, Harlan and Witkiewicz, writing about the latter: &quot;He was a gentlemanly and agreeable man, of about thirty years of age, spoke French, Turkish and Persian fluently, and wore the uniform of an officer of the Cossacks&quot;.

==Prince of Ghor==

In 1838, Harlan set off on a punitive expedition against the Uzbek slave trader and warlord Muhammad Murad Beg. He had multiple reasons for doing this: he wanted to help Dost Mohammad assert his authority outside of Kabul; he had a deep-seated opposition to slavery; and he wanted to demonstrate that a modern army could successfully cross the Hindu Kush. Taking a force of approximately 1,400 cavalry, 1,100 infantry, 1,500 support personnel and camp followers, 2,000 horses, and 400 camels, Harlan thought of himself as a modern-day Alexander the Great. In emulation of Alexander the Great, Harlan also took along with him a war elephant. He was accompanied by a younger son and a secretary of Dost Mohammad. Dost Mohammad sought to collect tribute from the Hazara, who were willing if the Afghans also ended Murad Beg&#x27;s raids. Before leaving Kabul to hunt down Murad Beg, Dost Mohammad, knowing of Harlan&#x27;s fascination with ancient Greece, gave him a gift of a piece of jewelry found at Bagram, the site of the ancient Greek city of &quot;Alexandria ad Caucasum&quot;, depicting the goddess Athena, which greatly moved him. Just like his hero Alexander the Great, Harlan discovered that his war elephant could not handle the extreme cold of the Hindu Kush mountains, and Harlan was forced to send the elephant back to Kabul. High up in the Hindu Kush at the pass of Khazar, a good 12,500 feet above sea level, Harland had the Stars-and-Stripes raised on the highest peak with troops firing a twenty-six-gun-salute as Harlan wrote: &quot;the star spangled banner gracefully waved amid the icy peaks and soilless rugged rocks of the region, seeming sacred to the solitude of an undisturbed eternity&quot;. Harlan then led his army down &quot;past glaciers and silent dells, and frowning rocks blackened by age&quot;, battling rain and snow as &quot;these phenomena alternately and capriciously coquetted with our ever changing climate&quot;.

After an arduous journey (which included an American flag-raising ceremony at the top of the Indian Caucasus), Harlan reinforced his army with local Hazaras, most of whom lived in fear of the slave traders. The Hazaras are believed to be the descendants of the Mongols who conquered Afghanistan in the 13th century, which made them different both culturally and to a certain extent linguistically from the rest of the Afghan peoples. (The Hazaras speak a distinctive sub-dialect of Dari, which itself is a dialect of Persian.) Harlan noted the Hazaras did not look like other Afghans. Because the Hazaras are ethnically distinct and are Shia Muslims, the Sunni Muslim Uzbeks and Tajiks liked to raid their lands for slaves. Harlan noted that because of the fear of Uzbek slavers, the houses of the Hazaras were &quot;half sunk into slopes of hills&quot; under &quot;a bastion constructed of sun-dried mud, where people of the village can resort in case of danger from the sudden forays of the Tartar robbers.&quot; Harlan further noted the brutality of the Uzbek slavers who sewed their victims together as they marched them off to the slave markets, observing:

Harlan&#x27;s first major military engagement was a short siege at the citadel of Saighan, Afghanistan controlled by the Tajik slave-trader Mohammad Ali Beg. Harlan&#x27;s artillery made short work of the fortress. As a result of this performance, local powers clamored to become Harlan&#x27;s friends as various Hazara chiefs asked to see Harlan, the man who had brought down the walls of the mighty fortress of Saighan, and who promised to end the raids of the slavers.

One of the most powerful and ambitious local rulers was Mohammad Reffee Beg Hazara, a prince of Ghor, an area in the central and western part of what is now the country of Afghanistan. He and his retinue feasted for ten days with Harlan&#x27;s force, during which time they observed the remarkable discipline and organization of the modern army. They invited the American back to Reffee&#x27;s mountain stronghold. Harlan was amazed by the working feudal system. He admired the Hazaras, both because of the absence of slavery in their culture and by the gender equality he observed (unusual in that region at the time). Harlan observed that the Harzara women did not wear veils, worked out in the fields with their husbands, loved to hunt deer with their greyhound dogs while riding horses at full gallop and firing arrows aside their mounts, and even went to war with their menfolk. Writing about relations between the sexes among the Hazaras, Harlan noted: A strong advocate of sexual equality, Harlan was greatly impressed with the Hazara women who were the equals of the Hazara men, and whom he also praised as most beautiful. Macintyre noted that Harlan&#x27;s purple prose tended to be at its most purplest when he was in love, and in his descriptions of the Hazarjat, Harlan&#x27;s flowery style was at its most florid, leading Macintyre to speculate Harlan found love with a Hazara girl. At the end of Harlan&#x27;s visit, he and Reffee came to an agreement. Harlan and his heirs would be the &quot;Prince of Ghor&quot; in perpetuity, with Reffee as his vizier. In return, Harlan would raise and train an army with the ultimate goal of solidifying and expanding Ghor&#x27;s autonomy. At another fortress, that of Derra i Esoff, ruled by an Uzbek slaver Soofey Beg, who had recently enslaved 300 Hazara families, Harlan began a siege and soon his artillery had smashed holes in the wall of the fortress. Harlan sent his Hazara tribesmen into the breach, writing: After taking the fortress, Harlan found about 400 Hazara slaves, whom he promptly had &quot;released from a loathsome confinement in the dry wells and dungeons of the castle and sent home to their friends&quot;.

Harlan tracked Murad Beg down to his fortress in Kunduz. Beg dragged out the only cannon at his fort, an old Persian gun left over from the days of Nadir Shah to try to intimidate Harlan. As an amateur horticulturist, Harlan was offended that the Uzbeks were much more interested in raiding for slaves than in growing flowers, noting &quot;Little attention is bestowed upon the elegant in horticulture. Their flowers are, consequently, few and not of a pleasing variety&quot;. As soon as Harlan reached Kunduz, Murad Beg sent out emissaries to resolve a diplomatic solution as Harlan noted: &quot;The Uzbecks [Uzbeks] have a great horror of bloodshed, and think that prudence is the better part of valor&quot;. Harlan further noted that Uzbek armies always fought the same way: &quot;a few individual sallies of vaunting cavaliers are made in advance, the parties uttering unearthly yells of defiance, and assuming threatening attitudes. A parley ensures, an interview between the leaders follow, and the affair terminates with the harmless festivals of a tournament.&quot; As Harlan surrounded Kunduz, Murad Beg, who was terrified of giving battle, chose to make a treaty with Harlan to recognize Dost Mohammad as the Emir of Afghanistan and to stop slave raiding in exchange for being allowed Kunduz. Harlan described Murad Beg as: 

However, when Harlan returned to Kabul the British forces with William Hay Macnaghten arrived to occupy the city in an early stage of the First Anglo-Afghan War. The British had restored Shuja, and Harlan heard a proclamation read by Shuja&#x27;s herald from the Bala Hisar fortress: &quot;Everyone is commanded not to ascend the heights of the vicinity of the Royal harem under the pain of being disemboweled alive. May the king live forever!&quot;. Harlan commented that Shuja&#x27;s &quot;harsh barbarity&quot; had not changed, and he was going to be just as hated by his people now that he was restored as he was when was overthrown the first time back in 1809. Harlan quickly became a &quot;persona non-grata&quot;, and after some further travel returned to the United States.

==Homeward bound==
After leaving Afghanistan, Harlan spent some time in Imperial Russia. A woman he knew in England, sent letters to Russian nobility in which she claimed that Harlan was an experienced administrator who could help the Russian peasantry better itself. Though he was well liked by Russia&#x27;s society women, Harlan made no important government contacts and soon decided to go back to America.

Once he returned to America, Harlan was feted as a national hero. He skillfully played the press, telling them not to dwell on his royal title, as he &quot;looks upon kingdoms and principalities as of frivolous import, when set in opposition to the honorable and estimable title of American citizen&quot;. His glory quickly faded after the publication in Philadelphia of &quot;A Memoir of India and Afghanistan − With observations upon the present critical state and future prospects of those Countries&quot;. Harlan had been working on a longer book called &quot;The British Empire in India&quot;, but the almost total annihilation of the British force retreating from Kabul in the Hindu Kush in January 1842 attracted much media attention in the United States, so Harlan tried to cash in with his hastily written and published &quot;A Memoir of India and Afghanistan&quot;. In his book Harlan attacked enemies he made in India, both European and Indian. Most alarmingly, he wrote about the ease with which Russia could, if it so chose, attack and seriously harm the British Empire. Harlan was denounced in Britain, although, as one historian has observed, his book was 

The American press did not pan him, but the controversy ensured that he would never publish another book. The writer Herman Melville appears to have read &quot;A Memoir of India and Afghanistan&quot;, as the references to the First Anglo-Afghan War in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; seem to be based on Harlan&#x27;s book.

With his funds dwindling, Harlan took on new tasks. He began lobbying the American government to import camels to settle the Western United States. His real hope was that they would order their camels from Afghanistan and send him there as a purchasing agent. Harlan convinced the government that camels would be a worthy investment (Secretary of War Jefferson Davis was particularly interested), but it decided that importing them from Africa would cost less than from Afghanistan. After the US Army discovered the resistance of American horses, mules, and cows to the aggressive camels, the Camel Corps was disbanded in 1863. The camels were set free in Arizona.

On May 1, 1849, Harlan married an Elizabeth Baker in Chester County, Pennsylvania. As Miss Baker was a Quaker like Harlan, who had abandoned the pacifism of his faith during his time in Asia, her family was scandalized that she married a man who had fought in wars. In 1852, Harlan&#x27;s wife bore a daughter, Sarah Victoria, whom he greatly loved, being by all accounts a doting father. However, Harlan&#x27;s massive unpublished manuscript telling his life story only mentions his wife once and very briefly at that, and he always carried with him a poem he had written in 1820 for Elizabeth Swaim until the day of his death.

Harlan next decided that he would convince the government to buy Afghan grapes. He spent two years working on this venture, but the coming of the American Civil War prevented this.

==American Civil War==
Harlan then proposed to raise a regiment.

In 1861, when the American Civil War began, Harlan wrote to the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, declaring that &quot;General Josiah Harlan&quot; was ready and willing to fight for the Union against the Confederate States of America. Macintyre noted: &quot;The man who had trained the Afghan army and humbled the slaving warlord Murad Beg saw no reason why he should not go into battle, once more, with a private army. Bizarrely, nor did the authorities in Washington, and permission was duly granted for the formation of &quot;Harlan&#x27;s Light Cavalry&quot;. Harlan had no formal rank, no experience of the American army, and had no knowledge of modern warfare. He was also sixty-two years old, but gave his age as fifty-six&quot;. He raised a Union regiment 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry of which he was colonel, but he was used to dealing with military underlings in the way an oriental prince would. This led to a messy court-martial, but the aging Harlan ended his service due to medical problems. Harlan collapsed on July 15, 1862, while serving in Virginia from the effects of a mixture of fever, dehydration, and dysentery, was ordered to give up command of his regiment, and was reluctantly invalided out of the United States Army on August 19, 1862, on the grounds he was &quot;debilitated from diarrhea&quot;.

==Legacy==
He wound up in San Francisco, working as a doctor, dying of tuberculosis in 1871. He was essentially forgotten. His remains were buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco (now defunct), but were moved and his gravesite is unknown. However, Harlan proved to be an inspiration for Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1888 short story &quot;The Man Who Would Be King,&quot; which in its turn became a popular 1975 film starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Many critics have noted a close resemblance between Daniel Dravot, the hero of &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; and Harlan. Both were ambitious adventurers burning to conquer a kingdom in Central Asia, both entered Afghanistan disguised as a Muslim holy man, both were Freemasons, both wanted to emulate Alexander the Great, and both were granted Afghan titles of nobility.

However, Harlan had no counterpart to Peachey Carnehan, Dravot&#x27;s sidekick, but the character of Carnehan was created by Kipling to explain to the narrator of &quot;The Man Who Would Be A King&quot; how Dravot was killed in Afghanistan. Kipling, who was a Freemason himself, had always said he received the inspiration for &quot;The Man Who Would Be A King&quot; while working as a journalist in 1880s India, saying that an unnamed Freemason had told him the stories that gave him the idea for &quot;The Man Who Would Be King,&quot; which suggests that Harlan&#x27;s adventures in Afghanistan were still being retold in Masonic lodges in India in the 1880s.

Harlan also appears in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s novel &quot;Flashman and the Mountain of Light&quot;.

== Works ==

== In popular culture ==
In the 2019 board game Pax Pamir: Second Edition, Josiah Harlan is an individual of Afghan loyalty, represented as a card, whom the player&#x27;s can recruit to aid them in their vying for control in Afghanistan after the fall of the Durrani Empire.

Harlan is also a character in &#x27;Flashman and the Mountain of Light&#x27;, the ninth book of George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s Flashman Papers series.

Harlan is also a character in Paradox Interactive&#x27;s grand strategy video game &#x27;Victoria 3&#x27;.

<doc id="682821" wikidata="Q836293" url="?curid=682821" title="List of world number one snooker players">
<text>The sport of snooker has utilised a world rankings system since 1975, used to seed players on the World Snooker Tour for tournaments. Originally, rankings were published once a year at the conclusion of a season: this had the effect of ensuring the World Champion would be the top seed for the entirety of the subsequent season. Since 2010, however, the rankings were changed so that they would be updated after every ranking tournament. The number one ranking has been held by twelve players; Ray Reardon was the first to hold the position, and was followed by Cliff Thorburn, Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, John Higgins, Mark Williams, Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, Neil Robertson, Mark Selby, Judd Trump, Ding Junhui and Mark Allen.

Hendry held the number one position for the longest time under the annual format, holding it for nine years in total. Since it changed to a rolling format in 2010, Selby has held the rank longer than anyone else.

== History ==

The sport of professional snooker first adopted a ranking system for the 1975–76 season, which saw Ray Reardon ranked in the top position. An Order of Merit was published in the 1975/76 season to determine the seedings for events, and the first set of official rankings the following year used the same criteria. Certain events carried ranking points, and at the end of the season, they were tallied. The World Snooker Championship originally was the only event to offer ranking points, until the 1982 International Open. Over the next 22 seasons, five men held the first position; Reardon (1976/77 to 1980/81), Cliff Thorburn (1981/82), Reardon again for 1982/83, Steve Davis (1983/84 to 1989/90) and Stephen Hendry (1990/91 to 1997/98). From 1998/99 to 2009/10, the title was shared by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan (five seasons), John Higgins (three seasons) and Mark Williams (three seasons), while Hendry regained the position for the 2006/07 season. In the first 34 years of the world rankings, only seven players held the number one position.

For the 2010–11 snooker season, the world rankings were changed to be updated after each tournament carrying ranking points. This was altered from the 2014–15 snooker season, where ranking points were based entirely on the prize money won from qualifying events. Since the introduction of the new system, Higgins, Neil Robertson, Williams, Mark Selby, Judd Trump, Ding Junhui, and O&#x27;Sullivan have all attained the number one rank. Selby has also seven seasons ranked in first place, putting him in joint third place overall with Reardon and Davis, O&#x27;Sullivan is in second with (eight times) and behind Hendry (nine times). 

== List of players ==
Hendry holds the record for most seasons at number one under the traditional system, with nine seasons (1990/1991–1997/1998 and again in 2006–07). His first spell of eight consecutive seasons in this position is also a record. Under the rolling ranking format, Mark Selby holds both the total and consecutive records.

<text>Metin Kaplan (born 14 November 1952) is the leader of the Islamic extremist movement &quot;Kalifatsstaat&quot; (&quot;Caliphate State&quot;) which is based in Cologne, Germany.

== Kalifatsstaat ==
Kaplan was born in the Turkish province of Erzurum. Kaplan, who was prosecuted as an enemy of the state in Turkey and faced the death penalty, sought political asylum in Germany and traveled there in 1983 as a refugee, together with his father, Cemaleddin Kaplan (also known as Cemaleddin Hocaoğlu), who was a leading figure in Islamist circles among Turkish diaspora in Germany. His father ran two publications: &quot;Tebliğ&quot; and &quot;Ümmet&quot;.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1995, Metin Kaplan became leader of the Caliphate State.

The movement&#x27;s stated goal is to overthrow the government of Turkey and establish an Islamist state in the country. The movement was previously known as the &quot;Union of Islamic Associations and Communities&quot; and is on Turkey&#x27;s official list of terrorist organizations as &quot;Hilafet Devleti&quot; (literally: &quot;Caliphate State&quot;). The self-styled &quot;Caliph of Cologne&quot; chose the city of Cologne as his residence. After being closely watched by the German Verfassungsschutz for several years, the movement was outlawed in 2001.

The movement has published a text called &quot;The New World Order&quot; which contains:
== Arrest ==
His rival İbrahim Sofu was murdered in 1997. Kaplan was convicted by a German court of solicitation of murder and spent four years in jail.

In May 2004, after reassurances that he would not be tortured if he was extradited to Turkey, a German court rescinded his refugee status and authorised his extradition to Turkey. Shortly after the court&#x27;s decision, before German police could arrest him, Kaplan disappeared from Cologne. After the court decision was temporarily suspended, Kaplan reappeared on 31 May, claiming to have been sick during his disappearance.

On 12 October, the Verwaltungsgericht of Cologne decided that Kaplan could be extradited despite a pending appeal to the Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig. He was arrested in an internet cafe in Cologne and brought to the Düsseldorf airport, where a chartered Lear Jet took him to Istanbul. On arrival he was immediately arrested by Turkish police and taken to prison. This extradition case is unusual because governments usually refuse to extradite people to face trial for political crimes such as treason and espionage.

Kaplan&#x27;s trial started on 20 December 2004. In 2005, Kaplan was convicted of attempting to overthrow the constitution and treason. He was sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment. During the trial, Kaplan was confined to the high security prison of Tekirdağ. Turkish authorities have accused him of plotting a terrorist attack against the Turkish government in 1998 and a plot to attack the Anıtkabir by flying a Cessna laden with explosives into it. Kaplan conceded that he believes the state of Turkey should be replaced with an Islamist state, but denies ever having planned to resort to violent means.

== Release from prison and acquittal after retrial ==
Kaplan&#x27;s sentence was reduced to 17.5 years in prison in 2010, and he was released from prison in November 2016. He was ultimately acquitted after a retrial on 16 February 2021.

<text>In Our Gun is the third studio album by English rock band Gomez, released on 18 March 2002 by Hut Records.

==Background==
Gomez released their second studio album &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; in September 1999. It peaked at number two in the UK; all three of its singles charted within the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues Alibi&quot; reaching the highest at number 18. In April 2000, the band embarked on a UK tour, which was soon followed by stints in Australia, Japan, and the US. Around this time, they released the &quot;Machismo E.P.&quot;, which saw the band explore electronica.

They released the compilation album &quot;Abandoned Shopping Trolley Hotline&quot; in September 2000, which was preceded by appearances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. As the band had spent the preceding three years constantly touring, they took six-month break and visited Australia, Cambodia, and Vietnam, before working on their next album. By April 2001, the band were in the process of making demos for their next release. Sessions for the new album were held at Batsford Manor and Real World Studios, where the band and Miti Adhikari handling recording, with assistance from Claire Lewis. The band and Adhikari mixed the recordings at Real World, while Frank Arkwright mastered the album at The Townhouse.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound has been described as alternative country, garage rock, and experimental pop, with influence from electronica, which the band had previously touched on with the &quot;Machismo E.P.&quot;. The album is split into two parts: one centred around acoustic instrumentation, and the other being dance-based. It incorporates the use of drum machines, sequencers, loops, and samples. Lewis did extra programming and Dajon Everett provided percussion and celeste throughout the album. Over the course of it, additional musicians appeared on various songs: Tony Robinson with brass on &quot;Shot Shot&quot;, trumpet and valve trombone on &quot;Rex Kramer&quot;, &quot;Detroit Swing 66&quot; and &quot;Even Song&quot;, and organ on &quot;In Our Gun&quot; and &quot;Even Song&quot;; Tony Looby with alto saxophone on &quot;Detroit Swing 66&quot; and &quot;Even Song&quot;, and baritone saxophone on &quot;Even Song&quot;; Rob Charles with baritone saxophone on &quot;Detroit Swing 66&quot;, and tenor saxophone on &quot;Detroit Swing 66&quot; and &quot;Even Song&quot;; Danny Thompson with double bass on &quot;In Our Gun&quot;; Grace Elison with vocals on &quot;Drench&quot;; and Graham Wakefield with loops on &quot;Rex Kramer&quot;, and flange on &quot;In Our Gun&quot;.

The album opens with &quot;Shot Shot&quot;, an up-tempo song that includes saxophone, theremin, and a synthesizer. The psychedelic and electronic funk track &quot;Rex Kramer&quot; features guitarist Ben Ottewell on lead vocals. The folktronica &quot;Detroit Swing 66&quot; includes drum and bass breakbeats. &quot;In Our Gun&quot; begins as an alternative country ballad that shifts into techno-rock in the vein of the Prodigy partway through. Guitarist Ian Ball said the song was influenced by 2000 United States election controversy, and serves as the band&#x27;s first excursion into protest songs. &quot;Even Song&quot; is a slow-paced blues song. &quot;Ruff Stuff&quot; sees arcade game sounds mixed with funk; it talks about a relationship that is ruined by the narrator&#x27;s drug addiction.

&quot;Sound of Sounds&quot; is a ballad that evoked &quot;Liquid Skin&quot; song &quot;We Haven&#x27;t Turned Around&quot;. Guitarist Tom Gray said the track was &quot;a love song to music itself&quot;. &quot;Army Dub&quot; is an industrial reggae song that recalled the work of the Beta Band. Ball said they wrote the song with a Roland TR-505, which they used to get a &quot;massive powerful sound&quot;. &quot;Miles End&quot; talks about a that has lost his ability to attract women, and is followed by the Brit funk song &quot;Ping One Down&quot;. &quot;Drench&quot; is a psychedelic track, while &quot;1000 Times&quot; is a lullaby. The latter was inspired by a newspaper cover that Gray saw, depicting Posh Spice and David Beckham on the cover, &quot;and on the fourth page, it was like, ‘50 killed in . . . ,’ and I said, what kind of universe am I living in here?&quot; The album concludes with &quot;Ballad of Nice &amp; Easy&quot;, a southern rock song, which was reminiscent of the work of the Allman Brothers Band. It initially began as an acoustic-guitar-and-percussion piece, the tempo of which was sped up after drummer Olly Peacock heard it.

==Release==
On 3 January 2002, &quot; In Our Gun&quot; was announced for release in two months&#x27; time. &quot;Shot Shot&quot; was released as a single on 4 March 2002. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Silhouettes&quot; and &quot;Coltrane&quot;, while the second featured &quot;Air-Hostess Song&quot; and &quot;Pop Juice&quot;. The music video for &quot;Shot Shot&quot; was posted on &quot;Dotmusic&quot; on 11 March 2002. &quot;In Our Gun&quot; was released on 18 March 2002 through Hut Records; Australia received a tour edition bonus disc. It was promoted with club nights and listening parties leading up to the release. The album was released in United States on 23 April 2002; 40,000 copies were sent to stores through distributor EMD. That same month, the band embarked on a four-week tour of the UK.

&quot;Sound of Sounds&quot; and &quot;Ping One Down&quot; were released as a Double A-Sided single on 20 May 2002. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Where Are Your Friends&quot;, a live version of &quot;Ping One Down&quot;, and the music video for &quot;Sound of Sounds&quot;, while the second included &quot;Click Click&quot;, an instrumental version of &quot;Sound of Sounds&quot;, and the music video for &quot;Ping One Down&quot;. The &quot;Detroit Swing 66 / Ping One Down EP&quot; was released exclusively in Australia on 16 July 2002, consisting of &quot;Detroit Swing 66&quot;, &quot;Ping One Down&quot;, &quot;Silhouettes&quot;, &quot;Coltrane&quot;, &quot;Air-Hostess Song&quot;, &quot;Pop Juice&quot;, and &quot;Click Click&quot;. In September and October 2002, the band embarked on a tour of the US. Following this, they went on a UK tour in November and December 2002. In April and May 2003, the band toured the US again, which included an appearance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

==Reception==

&quot;In Our Gun&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 18 reviews.

In his review for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, contributor Matt Cibula wrote that &quot;everyone who doesn’t like this record is insane in a bad way. Screw Wilco; &quot;In Our Gun&quot; is sounding very much like the Album of the Year.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Sean Westergaard said the album had &quot;all the elements that made their debut so great, and then some.&quot; He explained that the band &quot;cover a lot of musical territory, [...] with all the effortlessness displayed on Bring It On&quot;. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer Tom Carlin wrote that it was a &quot;very good&quot; release that sees the band dropping the &quot;noodling, and have developed a much tighter, rigid sound&quot;. The staff at &quot;E! Online&quot; found the album to easily switch from different styles, with it be &quot;creative, inspired and, most important, individual&quot;. Stephen Dalton of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that the album had &quot;[t]ighter song structures, more varied sounds, richly layered production and subtle nods to deeper desires&quot; that make it the &quot;most accessible Gomez album yet for casual fans&quot;. No Ripcord&#x27;s David Coleman found that some of the tracks were &quot;tricky to listen to, but Gomez&#x27;s credit a lot of it hits the spot as well&quot;. In spite of this, he called it a &quot;brave&quot; album for the band to make, as it &quot;would have been a lot easier for them to peddle another album of the same&quot; material as their earlier work.

Nude as the News&#x27;s Western Homes wrote that the album was an improvement on &quot;its languid predecessor [...] both in terms of economy and hooks, and the songs here largely don&#x27;t outstay their welcomes&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Ernesto Lechner considered the songwriting to be &quot;focused&quot;, with &quot;plenty of soul beneath the multilayered structures and aesthetic braggadocio&quot;. &quot;Stylus&quot; writer Steve Lichtenstein said that &quot;what ultimately drowns&quot; the album was the &quot;misguided attempts at moody electronica,&quot; which they had done more successfully in the past. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Eric Carr said the band &quot;has seen fit to unleash a third in their war against discerning audiophiles everywhere, and they call it &quot;In Our Gun&quot;&quot;. He referred to it as &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s monster of an album-- overwrought and disjointed, executed with some technical precision, but completely devoid of any flow, feeling, or spontaneity.&quot;

&quot;Shot Shot&quot; reached number 28 in the UK. &quot;Sound of Sounds&quot;/&quot;Ping One Down&quot; reached number 48 in the UK. No Ripchord ranked &quot;In Our Gun&quot; at number 35 on their list of The Top Fifty Albums of 2002.

<text>Daryle Lamar Ward (born June 27, 1975) is an American former professional baseball first baseman and left fielder. He played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1998 to 2008 for the Houston Astros, Los Angeles Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Washington Nationals, Atlanta Braves, and Chicago Cubs. He is the son of former major leaguer Gary Ward. Daryle Ward is currently the Hitting Coach for the Chattanooga Lookouts in the Cincinnati Reds organization.

==Career==

Ward came to the Houston Astros in December 1996 as part of a ten-player trade with Detroit. He won the 1999 AAA Home Run Derby in his home stadium of Zephyr Field in New Orleans. The next day, he hit a 3-run home run in the All Star Game, leading the PCL to victory after joining the team as a last minute replacement. His home run outshone Russell Branyan&#x27;s solo home run in the same game. He debuted in 1999, hitting 8 home runs in 150 at bats. In 2000, he hit 20 home runs in just 264 at-bats. In his third season for the Astros, Ward batted .263 with 9 home runs and 39 RBI in 95 games. The next year, 2002, he batted .276 with 12 home runs and 72 RBIs in 136 games. On July 6 of that year, he became the first player to hit a home run out of Pittsburgh&#x27;s PNC Park and into the Allegheny River &quot;on the fly&quot; during a regular-season game (the other player being Garrett Jones with a 463-foot home run on June 2, 2013); the shot, a grand slam, came off Pittsburgh&#x27;s Kip Wells. Many Home Runs have made the river on the bounce, and several home runs hit during the 2006 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby made the river on the fly as well, creating speculation of juiced balls.

After the season the Astros traded Ward to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He spent 2003 in a part-time role, hitting .183 with one extra base hit (a double) in 109 at-bats. After the season, the Dodgers released Ward, and the Pirates signed him as a minor league free agent. Ward played better in 2004, and the Pirates re-signed him for 2005 as their part-time first baseman. Ward has signed on to become a member of the Chicago Cubs bench for 2007. In 549 career games played, Ward has batted .259 (384-1485), with 65 home runs, 254 RBI, 155 runs, 80 doubles and four triples, with an on-base percentage (OBP) of .306 and slugging percentage (SLG) of .447.

===2004 season===
After being called up from the Triple-A Nashville Sounds to replace Raúl Mondesí, Ward got off to a torrid start. On May 26, 2004, Ward, recalled from the Triple-A Nashville Sounds two weeks before, hit for the cycle and tied his career high with six RBI in the Pirates&#x27; 11–8 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Ward hit a two-run double in the first, an RBI triple in the fourth, golfed a three-run homer in the fifth and singled in the ninth. He was the first Pittsburgh player to hit for the cycle since Jason Kendall on May 19, 2000, against the Cardinals. Ward joined his father, Gary, to become the first father-son combination in major league history to hit for the cycle. The elder Ward accomplished the feat on September 18, 1980, for the Minnesota Twins. (They were later joined by Craig and Cavan Biggio on September 17, 2019 as the only 2 father and son duos to hit for the cycle in MLB history.) Ward slumped later in the season, slowed down by a wrist injury, and finished hitting .249 with 15 home runs and 57 RBI, with a .306 OBP and .474 SLG. Ward, along with Valerio de los Santos, signed a deal to play with the Nationals.

===2006 season===
On August 31, 2006, Ward was traded to the Atlanta Braves for minor-league pitcher Luis Atilano.

===2007 season===
Ward was signed on December 7, 2006 by the Chicago Cubs to a one-year deal worth $1.05 million after hitting .308 with a .380 OBP in 2006 for Washington and Atlanta in 150 combined plate appearances. He replaced John Mabry as a backup at 1st base to Derrek Lee. On May 6, Ward hit a game-winning single against his former team, the Washington Nationals. He was also called to replace Derrek Lee on May 13, after Lee left the game with neck spasms. Ward also saw time as a pinch hitter in close game situations. On August 18 Ward hit a grand slam in the third inning off of St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Anthony Reyes, the third of his career and his first home run as a member of the Cubs. Ward finished the season with a career-high .327 batting average in 110 at-bats.

===2008 season===
On August 15, Ward launched a three-run pinch-hit homer with one out in the ninth inning to lift the Cubs to a 6–5 victory over the Florida Marlins for their ninth straight road win. The Cubs had lost their last 10 games at that stadium. He became a free agent at the end of the season. Ward finished the season with a .216 batting average, the second lowest of his career.

===Minor Leagues===

On February 5, 2009, Ward signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds.

He was released by the Reds on March 23, 2009. He played in April with the Newark Bears and hit .222 in eight games before being signed to a minor league deal on May 2 with the Chicago White Sox and assigned to Triple A Charlotte where he hit 8 home runs in 69 games.

On August 6, he was traded to the Washington Nationals organization along with outfielder Norris Hopper for cash and assigned to Syracuse. Ward hit five home runs in 30 games with the Syracuse Chiefs. Ward began the 2010 season with the Newark Bears. He signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox on November 22, 2010.

Ward signed a contract to play his second full season with the Newark Bears on May 28, 2011. He was utilized as a first baseman and designated hitter. On August 1, he signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks and was assigned to the Double-A Mobile BayBears. On September 13, 2011, he was released. After the season, he tested positive for an amphetamine and received a 50-game suspension for the following season.

Ward played with the Lancaster Barnstormers in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in 2012 and 2013 and split 2014 between the Atlantic League (with the Somerset Patriots) and the Mexican League. On April 9, 2015, prior to the 2015 Atlantic League Season Ward signed with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs. On July 20, he was released. On August 5, 2015, he signed a contract with the Sugar Land Skeeters.

==Coaching Career==
Ward was named hitting coach for the Chattanooga Lookouts for the 2023 season.

In 2025, Ward was named hitting coach for the Louisville Bats the Triple-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.

<doc id="682840" wikidata="Q588175" url="?curid=682840" title="Brian Robertson (guitarist)">
<text>Brian David Robertson (born 12 February 1956) is a Scottish rock guitarist, best known as a former member of Thin Lizzy from 1974 to 1978, and Motörhead from 1982 to 1983, replacing Fast Eddie Clarke.

==Early life==
Robertson was born in Clarkston, Renfrewshire (now part of East Renfrewshire), where he was educated, attending Eastwood High School in nearby
Newton Mearns, and became a musician. He studied cello and classical piano for eight years before switching to the guitar and drums. He played in gigs around his local area with bands like Dream Police, who later evolved into the Average White Band.

==Career==
===Thin Lizzy===
In June 1974, Thin Lizzy were auditioning for two new guitarists and a try-out for Robertson was arranged. Aged 18, Robertson was taken on along with Scott Gorham on the other lead guitar. He was given the nickname &quot;Robbo&quot; by Phil Lynott to distinguish him from drummer Brian Downey. The two lead guitarists provided a critical part of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s signature sound, referred to by critics as their &quot;twin guitar attack&quot;. During his time in the band, Robertson was a contributing member to five studio albums released by Thin Lizzy: &quot;Nightlife&quot; (1974), &quot;Fighting&quot; (1975), &quot;Jailbreak&quot; (1976), &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; (1976), &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; (1977) and a live album &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; (1978).

Although frontman, bassist/lead vocalist Phil Lynott was the primary songwriter for Thin Lizzy&#x27;s material, Robertson contributed a substantial share of songwriting for the band, sometimes collaborating with Lynott and the band. &quot;Nightlife&quot; and &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; were the only records that did not feature his songwriting and he performed only on selected tracks from the latter album.

In Thin Lizzy, the unusual twin harmony lead guitar sound, instigated by Robertson and Gorham, contributed much to the distinctive sound of the band and influenced subsequent bands such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, The Darkness and Velvet Revolver. Robertson&#x27;s pioneering, unconventional use of the wah-wah pedal as an extension of the instrument during soloing rather than as a purely rhythmic effect provided a boost to the band as well.

Robertson struggled to deal with Lizzy&#x27;s newfound fame after the release of the hit single &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; and the accompanying &quot;Jailbreak&quot; LP. He began drinking heavily towards the end of 1976. A further tour of the US was planned for December 1976, but it had to be cancelled when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson suffered a hand injury when trying to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend Frankie Miller in a fracas at the Speakeasy Club in London. Miller had been jamming onstage with the reggae band Gonzalez, but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a bottle in the dressing room, and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and nerve damage to his hand. Robertson subsequently broke Hunte&#x27;s leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit on the head with a bottle, rendering him unconscious.

Robertson maintains that, contrary to reports at the time, he was not drunk and had only gone to the venue for a meal. Lynott was angry and replaced Robertson with Gary Moore for another tour of the States in January–March 1977, this time supporting Queen.

While Robertson recuperated from his injury, Lizzy flew to Toronto in May 1977 to record the &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; album with American producer Tony Visconti, with Gorham ostensibly taking all of the guitar parts. However, at Gorham&#x27;s insistence, Lynott allowed Robertson to rejoin the band that June as a guest in Toronto. Gorham had left the songs &quot;Opium Trail&quot; and &quot;Killer Without a Cause&quot; without solos so that Robertson could contribute; the two also played lead together on one song, &quot;That Woman&#x27;s Gonna Break Your Heart.&quot; Robertson was fully reinstated for the remainder of 1977 and into 1978, during which the majority of the tapes for the band&#x27;s well-known double LP &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; were recorded. In July 1978 Robertson finally left the band for good, due mainly to his irreconcilable differences with Lynott, and was again replaced by Gary Moore, this time on an official basis.

===Wild Horses and Thin Lizzy farewell tour===
Robertson had formed Wild Horses along with another Scot, Rainbow bassist Jimmy Bain in 1977, while recovering from his injury. After his final exit from Thin Lizzy in 1978, he returned to the band. Achieving only partial success in the UK, the band split up after releasing two albums, &quot;Wild Horses&quot; (1980) and &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; (1981).

In 1980 Robertson was also featured on the Eric Burdon album &quot;Darkness Darkness&quot;. Robertson appeared for one performance of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s final tour in 1983, alongside other former guitarists. He was featured on the recording of the tour, Life, appearing on the songs &quot;Emerald&quot; and &quot;The Rocker.&quot; In 1986 he recorded a cover of &quot;Still in Love with You&quot; as a tribute to Phil Lynott, appearing alongside Bobby Tench.

===Motörhead===
In May 1982, Robertson replaced &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke as the lead guitarist of Motörhead, after Clarke walked out of the band midway through their &quot;Iron Fist&quot; tour. &quot;That felt totally uncertain,&quot; Robertson later told &quot;Classic Rock&quot;. &quot;It only came about because I was helping out some friends and, when they asked me to join officially, I said, &#x27;Okay, but I&#x27;m not fucking rewriting the Ace of Spades.&#x27;&quot; Following the completion of the tour, Robertson co-wrote and played on the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Another Perfect Day&quot;, which would prove to be his only studio album with the group. Robertson&#x27;s resistance to playing &quot;classic&quot; Motörhead songs live, along with a playing style and a fashion sense (he often sported a headband and leg warmers) that did not fit well with Motörhead&#x27;s aggressive music and look, resulted in his departure from the band just 18 months after he had joined. His last appearance with them was at the Metropol in Berlin, on 11 November 1983. 

Despite his short-lived tenure, Robertson would feature on three officially released live albums recorded during this time — &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Motörhead&quot;, a partial recording of the band&#x27;s show at L&#x27;Amour in New York on 10 August 1983, &quot;Live 1983&quot;, recorded in Sheffield on 9 June, and &quot;Live at Manchester Apollo&quot;, recorded the day after the Sheffield show. The latter two concerts were originally recorded as a source of B-sides for &quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; singles, but when Castle later bought Motörhead&#x27;s complete back catalog from Bronze Records they were released in full through the band&#x27;s fan club in the early 1990s.

===Later work===
After leaving Motörhead, Robertson briefly joined Gary Barden&#x27;s band Statetrooper. Soon after this, he joined long time friend (and fellow Scotsman) Frankie Miller and his band, which also consisted of Simon Kirke (drums) and Chrissie Stewart (bass). He played guitar on the album &quot;Dancing In The Rain&quot; that was released in 1985.

In 1992 Robertson made a guest appearance with Skyclad at the Dynamo Open Air Festival, in Eindhoven, Netherlands. In 2004 he also made a guest appearance with Ash at the Oxegen festival in Ireland, playing guitar on their version of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;.

He was reunited with Lizzy bandmates a final time in August 2005 for a tribute show in memory of Phil Lynott, in a lineup fronted by Gary Moore. Robertson and Moore appeared with Brian Downey, Scott Gorham, Eric Bell and Jethro Tull bassist Jonathan Noyce. This concert and an extended interview with Robertson were released on the DVD &quot;One Night in Dublin: A Tribute to Phil Lynott&quot;.

During February 2008 Robertson returned to the studio to work on new material. He also made a guest appearances on The Bitter Twins debut album &quot;Global Panic!&quot;, which was released in 2009.

His first solo album &quot;Diamonds and Dirt&quot;, featuring Ian Haugland of Europe, Nalle Pahlsson from Treat, Leif Sundin from MSG and Liny Wood, was recorded in Stockholm at Polar Studios over a two-year period. It was produced by Robertson, Soren Lindberg and Chris Laney. The album features thirteen songs, written by Robertson and others including Phil Lynott, Frankie Miller and Jim White. It was released in Europe through Steamhammer Records in March 2011.

==Personal life==

Robertson has one son with Karen Rix. They were introduced by Tommy Crossin of Rix&#x27;s management team, who also worked for Lemmy and Motörhead, in 1985 at Donington festival and later started dating. They lived together at The Barbican. Their son Logan Robertson was born in London 4 April 1991. Robertson lives in Essex, England when he is not on tour or recording in Scandinavia, where he spends a lot of his working time.

==Influences==

Like many British rock guitarists, Robertson was significantly influenced by earlier blues guitarists. Robertson&#x27;s influences include Freddie King, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Peter Green. ZZ Top&#x27;s Billy Gibbons is also mentioned as a later influence.

==Equipment==
===Guitars===

Robertson is often associated with a Black 1960 Les Paul Custom, with a white/parchment (rather than black) coloured pick guard, featured in photographs on the &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; album and the subsequent video. However, in an interview Robertson explained that his main guitar remains his original Thin Lizzy Sunburst 1973 Les Paul Deluxe, albeit re-fretted due to wear and with 1959 vintage Gibson Seth Lover PAF humbucker pickups fitted by his guitar technician. The pickups are without the normal German-silver pick-up covers, a popular modification.

Robertson acquired his Deluxe in 1974, just after joining Thin Lizzy. It was his main guitar on all of the Lizzy studio albums. In the autumn of 1977, when he had the pickups on the Deluxe changed, he began using the Custom (photographs taken at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, from October of that year are among the earliest-known images of Robertson using the guitar). This became his main guitar from then until the early 1980s, when he switched back to the Deluxe (he can be seen with it in some footage with Motorhead). It has been his main guitar ever since. Robertson can also be seen playing a white Fender Stratocaster with black pick-guard and a black Gibson SG in mimed footage with Lizzy. Indeed Brian was playing (or miming) the song &quot;Rosalie&quot; on a black 3-pick-up (black-white-black pick-ups sans covers) Gibson SG (possibly a &quot;Custom&quot;, judging by the distinctive double-diamond head-stock inlay) on the popular BBC show Top Of the Pops (TOTP) in 1978.

Robertson was also filmed playing a Mid 70&#x27;s Travis Bean TB1000A. The distinctive straight-sided T-cutout in the carved headstock of the solid Reynolds 6061 aluminium alloy core that includes, headstock, neck and continues behind a thin layer of Koa wood behind bridge, which is secured directly into the ally, on Dedication and Don&#x27;t Believe A Word.

Although associated with Marshall amplifiers (100 watt non-Master Volume Superlead heads and 25 W Celestion Greenback speakers), Robertson has been known to use Mesa Boogie (100 W Dual Rectifier head) and Soundman amplifiers. The &quot;Jailbreak&quot; album was recorded using a Carlsbro combo. Robertson&#x27;s original wah-pedal is a UK made Colorsound although he sometimes used a Cry Baby wah wah in the 1990s and a borrowed Vox Wah in the &quot;Still in Love with Blues&quot; video (which the host, Stuart Bull, cut the rubber feet off of, much to the dismay of Brian).

Robertson&#x27;s use of the WEM Copicat tape echo unit was later replaced by a modern rack mounted digital delay unit. He used a Black Les Paul custom and mentions he experimented with &quot;Boss Analog Chorus Delay, an MXR Pitch Transposer, Yamaha analogue delays, and MXR 32 band Graphic EQ&quot; during his Motörhead days.

Record producer Tony Visconti mentioned that for &quot;Killer Without A Cause,&quot; featured on the Bad Reputation album: 
... Robertson plays guitar through the strange talk box, the simple gizmo that Peter Frampton made famous on his successful live album.&quot;

On his VHS video &quot;Still in Love with the Blues&quot; Robertson is pictured with a vintage red Les Paul guitar, unusually equipped with soap-bar pickups and a trapeze bridge, although it does not feature on the video itself. It did however feature on TOTPs in Thin Lizzy&#x27;s 1976 appearance for the song &quot;The Boys are Back in Town&quot;. Robertson&#x27;s Facebook page features more information on this instrument: purchased by Thin Lizzy&#x27;s manager in 1973, the guitar has an unusually lightweight body as it was built by Les Paul himself for his then-wife, guitarist Mary Ford.

A detailed gear diagram of Robertson&#x27;s 1974 Thin Lizzy guitar rig is documented.

<text>Split the Difference is the fourth studio album by English indie rock band Gomez released on 17 May 2004 by Hut Records. Production on the album was overseen by the band and Tchad Blake, known for producing albums by artists such as Tom Waits and Crowded House.

==Reception==
The album was met with mixed critical response, with &quot;Allmusic&quot; rating it as four stars out of five and &quot;BBC Internet Music Reviews&quot; describing it as &quot;one of the finest releases of the year so far. If you were one of those people who wrote them off two years ago, it&#x27;s time to get listening again.&quot; However, the album received less than favourable reviews from a number of other sources, including &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;.

<doc id="682844" wikidata="Q708474" url="?curid=682844" title="James Wattana">
<text>James Wattana (; born January 17, 1970, as วัฒนา ภู่โอบอ้อม &quot;Wattana Pu-Ob-Orm&quot;, then renamed รัชพล ภู่โอบอ้อม &quot;Ratchapol Pu-Ob-Orm&quot; in 2003) is a Thai former professional snooker player.

A professional between 1989 and 2008, and from 2009 to 2020, Wattana reached his highest ranking position – world number 3 – for the 1994–95 season. He has won three ranking tournaments, the 1992 Strachan Open and the Thailand Open in 1994 and 1995, and has finished as the runner-up in a further five ranking events. He twice reached the semi-finals of the World Snooker Championship, in 1993 and 1997. When he was defeated in the semi-finals in 1993 by Jimmy White, it was only Wattana&#x27;s second appearance in the final televised stages at the Crucible Theatre, his first being the previous year when he lost in the second round to the eventual winner Stephen Hendry.

Having received two year invitational tour cards in 2014, 2016 and 2018, Wattana fell off the main tour at the end of the 2019/2020 season.

Back in Thailand, Wattana is known as &quot;Tong Sit Choi&quot; (Thai: &quot;ต๋อง ศิษย์ฉ่อย,&quot; roughly &quot;Tong, Disciple of Choi&quot;) a nickname which he got by winning a local youth tournament at the age of 14. &quot;Choi&quot; is from &quot;Choi Susas&quot; (Thai: &quot;ฉ่อย ซู่ซ่าส์&quot;), the nickname of Wattana&#x27;s father and mentor Kowin Pu-Ob-Orm.

==Career==
Wattana won his first major tournament, the Thailand Masters, in 1986, aged only 16. As an amateur, he won the Asian Snooker Championship twice and the £6,000 first prize for winning the 1988 Kent Challenge in Hong Kong. He turned professional in 1989, after winning the 1988 World Amateur Championship. His career peaked in the mid-1990s, when he twice won the Thailand Open and rose to number three in the world rankings. Prior to Wattana becoming a professional, snooker had been dominated by British (and to a lesser extent Irish, Canadian and Australian) players.

He was the eighth professional player to earn more than £1 million in prize money, and with three maximum breaks he is one of only eighteen players to have scored more than two maximums in competition. He scored his first one in 1991 at the World Masters and the second at the British Open, which was then, at seven minutes and nine seconds, the fastest ever made.

With the help of his PR team fronted by Yorkshire business tycoon Ed Clark, Wattana&#x27;s success caught the imagination of the Thai public, and he became the most admired sportsman in his home country. He helped raise the profile of the game in the Far East, and has been followed into the game by many players from Thailand, Hong Kong, and China, the most successful being Marco Fu and Ding Junhui. He is a Commander Third Class of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand, only the second sportsman to receive the country&#x27;s most prestigious civilian honour.

He reached the semi-finals of the World Snooker Championship in 1993 and 1997, losing narrowly in the latter to Stephen Hendry. After a strong 2004–05 season, he returned to the top 32 of the world rankings, despite being the first player since 1992 to experience a whitewash at the World Championship when he lost 0–10 against Ali Carter in the final round of qualifying at the 2005 tournament. By 2007, his continued poor form meant that he dropped off the main tour in 2008. He continued to play, however, and in 2008 he entered the World Amateur Championships in Wels, Austria, where he lost to eventual champion Thepchaiya Un-Nooh in the last 16. He won the 2009 Asian Championships in Tangshan, China, after beating Mei Xiwen 7–3 in the final.

His position on the current provisional rankings received a huge boost with a run to the venue stage of the China Open thanks to four straight qualifying victories.

The 2011/12 season proved to be relatively good, managing to qualify in 2 of the 8 ranking events, the Shanghai Masters losing to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 1–5 and the German Masters, beating Stephen Hendry 5–1 in the qualifiers, but then losing to Graeme Dott in the first round. At the end of the season he finished ranked 63, just inside the top 64.

In 2014, he lost his place on the professional snooker circuit, as he finished outside the top 64 on the official world rankings list at the end of the 2013/2014 season. However, he was one of three players awarded an invitational tour card for the next season – alongside Hendry and Steve Davis – and has since competed fairly regularly in tournaments as an amateur. In 2015, he lost in the first round of the qualifiers for the World Championship 3–10 to Jimmy White. In 2016, he lost in the first round of the qualifiers for the World Championship 6–10 to Peter Ebdon.

<doc id="682847" wikidata="Q929408" url="?curid=682847" title="Multivariate analysis of variance">
<text>In statistics, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a procedure for comparing multivariate sample means. As a multivariate procedure, it is used when there are two or more dependent variables, and is often followed by significance tests involving individual dependent variables separately.

Without relation to the image, the dependent variables may be k life satisfactions scores measured at sequential time points and p job satisfaction scores measured at sequential time points. In this case there are k+p dependent variables whose linear combination follows a multivariate normal distribution, multivariate variance-covariance matrix homogeneity, and linear relationship, no multicollinearity, and each without outliers. 

== Model ==

Assume formula_1 formula_2-dimensional observations, where the formula_3’th observation formula_4 is assigned to the group formula_5 and is distributed around the group center formula_6 with multivariate Gaussian noise: formula_7 where formula_8 is the covariance matrix. Then we formulate our null hypothesis as 
formula_9

==Relationship with ANOVA==
MANOVA is a generalized form of univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), although, unlike univariate ANOVA, it uses the covariance between outcome variables in testing the statistical significance of the mean differences.

Where sums of squares appear in univariate analysis of variance, in multivariate analysis of variance certain positive-definite matrices appear. The diagonal entries are the same kinds of sums of squares that appear in univariate ANOVA. The off-diagonal entries are corresponding sums of products. Under normality assumptions about error distributions, the counterpart of the sum of squares due to error has a Wishart distribution.
== Hypothesis Testing ==
First, define the following formula_10 matrices:

* formula_11: where the formula_3-th row is equal to formula_4

* formula_14: where the formula_3-th row is the best prediction given the group membership formula_16. That is the mean over all observation in group formula_16: formula_18.

* formula_19: where the formula_3-th row is the best prediction given no information. That is the empirical mean over all formula_1 observations formula_22

Then the matrix formula_23 is a generalization of the sum of squares explained by the group, and formula_24 is a generalization of the residual sum of squares. 
Note that alternatively one could also speak about covariances when the abovementioned matrices are scaled by 1/(n-1) since the subsequent test statistics do not change by multiplying formula_25 and formula_26 by the same non-zero constant.

The most common statistics are summaries based on the roots (or eigenvalues) formula_27 of the matrix formula_28

* Samuel Stanley Wilks&#x27; formula_29 distributed as lambda (Λ)
* the K. C. Sreedharan Pillai–M. S. Bartlett trace, formula_30
* the Lawley–Hotelling trace, formula_31
* Roy&#x27;s greatest root (also called &quot;Roy&#x27;s largest root&quot;), formula_32

Discussion continues over the merits of each, although the greatest root leads only to a bound on significance which is not generally of practical interest. A further complication is that, except for the Roy&#x27;s greatest root, the distribution of these statistics under the null hypothesis is not straightforward and can only be approximated except in a few low-dimensional cases.
An algorithm for the distribution of the Roy&#x27;s largest root under the null hypothesis was derived in while the distribution under the alternative is studied in.

The best-known approximation for Wilks&#x27; lambda was derived by C. R. Rao.

In the case of two groups, all the statistics are equivalent and the test reduces to Hotelling&#x27;s T-square.

== Introducing covariates (MANCOVA) ==
One can also test if there is a group effect after adjusting for covariates. For this, follow the procedure above but substitute formula_14 with the predictions of the general linear model, containing the group and the covariates, and substitute formula_19 with the predictions of the general linear model containing only the covariates (and an intercept). Then formula_25 are the additional sum of squares explained by adding the grouping information and formula_26 is the residual sum of squares of the model containing the grouping and the covariates.

Note that in case of unbalanced data, the order of adding the covariates matters.

==Correlation of dependent variables==
MANOVA&#x27;s power is affected by the correlations of the dependent variables and by the effect sizes associated with those variables. For example, when there are two groups and two dependent variables, MANOVA&#x27;s power is lowest when the correlation equals the ratio of the smaller to the larger standardized effect size.

<doc id="682848" wikidata="Q1419602" url="?curid=682848" title="First and Last and Always">
<text>First and Last and Always is the debut studio album by English gothic rock band the Sisters of Mercy, first released on 11 March 1985 through the band&#x27;s Merciful Release label. Prior to recording sessions for a debut album, the band started off by releasing multiple extended plays and singles from 1980 through 1984. Guitarist Ben Gunn departed the band in October 1983 and was subsequently replaced by Dead or Alive member Wayne Hussey. This created one of the band&#x27;s most iconic line-ups, comprising Hussey with frontman Andrew Eldritch, guitarist Gary Marx, and bassist Craig Adams.

After touring for two months and releasing the single &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, recording sessions with producer David M. Allen began at Strawberry Studios in Stockport during June 1984, with sessions also taking place at Genetic Studios in Reading. The sessions were prolonged due to Eldritch&#x27;s drug use and extended time spent on writing lyrics, though recording was eventually completed in November 1984. Similar to the band&#x27;s previous releases, they used a drum machine when recording, this time utilising an Oberheim DMX nicknamed &quot;Doktor Avalanche&quot;.

&quot;First and Last and Always&quot; was preceded by the singles &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;No Time to Cry&quot;, which peaked at number 45 and number 63, respectively, on the UK Singles Chart. The album peaked at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart, though the band had still been in debt afterward due to the production costs. The costs were recouped in 1988, and the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry in 1989 for selling 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The album was later certified gold by the BVMI in 2011 for selling 250,000 copies in Germany.

Although Eldritch and Hussey began writing new material soon after the album&#x27;s release, the Sisters of Mercy dissolved later in 1985 when Hussey, Marx, and Adams departed the band due to heightened tensions between them and Eldritch. Consequently, &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; was the only Sisters of Mercy album to feature Hussey, Marx, and Adams. In the aftermath of the disbandment, Hussey and Adams went on to form The Mission, while Eldritch created his side project The Sisterhood, though Eldritch would later restart the Sisters of Mercy with other members.

==Background==
The band was founded in 1980 by Andrew Eldritch and Gary Marx in Leeds. Up to 1983, they had produced five singles and two EPs, which were released on the band&#x27;s own indie label Merciful Release and were distributed independently as well. As the band became increasingly successful and featured regularly in the UK Indie Chart, a first studio album was announced in 1983 for the following year. Eldritch estimated the production costs at £40,000, a sum which exceeded the financial capabilities of an indie band. Around the same time talks with interested record labels began. Eldritch, who handled management and business affairs of the band, negotiated with several record companies early in the new year and finally signed a satisfactory contract with WEA Records. Merciful Release opened an office in London and founded its own publishing company Candelmaesse Limited, as well, which licensed the future song material to the publisher of RCA Records, RCA Music Limited.

In October 1983, guitarist Ben Gunn left. At the end of the year, through CBS Records, who were interested in signing the band, he was replaced by former Dead or Alive member Wayne Hussey. The new band line-up played its debut concert on 7 April 1984, which featured the newly written songs &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, &quot;Train&quot; and &quot;Walk Away&quot;. The gig was followed by a short American tour until 16 April. After returning to the UK, Eldritch wrote a new song called &quot;Wide Receiver&quot;, which was inspired by a term in American football and which he recorded on his own at home as a demo. The rudimentary song wasn&#x27;t used in the end, but Eldritch&#x27;s solo demo recording appeared in early 1992 on a bootleg album.

At Strawberry Recording Studios in Stockport, the Sisters of Mercy recorded their first single in March 1984 for WEA (&quot;Body and Soul&quot;), which was composed and produced by Eldritch himself and which was released on 4 June 1984. &quot;Body and Soul&quot; peaked at 46 on the UK Singles Chart. From 2 May to 6 June, the band toured the UK and Europe and tried out a new Gary Marx composition which he later used in Ghost Dance. Recommended by WEA Records, Cure producer Dave Allen saw the band in Amsterdam (2 June 1984) and later received a telegram by Andrew Eldritch which said: &quot;The Sisters say yes to Dave Allen&quot;. After the end of the tour, they began to prepare themselves for the album recordings, but first they entered Maida Vale Studios on 19 June to record a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1. The session was broadcast on 13 July when the Sisters of Mercy were already in the recording studio.

==Recording==
===Demo sessions===
After intense songwriting sessions, Gary Marx entered Parkside Studios, &quot;a tiny studio in a rehearsal complex off Armley Road where I&#x27;d been with Wayne to record some new demos with him singing.&quot; The recordings were engineered by Steve Allen. Eldritch was enthusiastic about the new material, and played some instrumental demos to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist Adam Sweeting: &quot;I think this stuff&#x27;s gonna be incredible, like nothing we&#x27;ve ever done before&quot;.

===Strawberry sessions===
At the end of June 1984, the Sisters of Mercy went with producer Dave Allen into the Strawberry Recording Studios in Stockport, near Manchester, for five weeks to record their first studio album. Studio costs were £500 a day and £3,250 a week. Eldritch spent the whole five weeks inside the studio and, according to Dave Allen, used large amounts of amphetamine on a daily basis. In Stockport, backing tracks and vocals were to be recorded. Additional vocals, overdubs and the final mix were planned for August at Genetic Studios. The finished album was to be released in the third week of October 1984. The band immediately started to record, with Hussey and Marx often providing guide vocals with their own lyrics which later showed up on bootlegs. Both Hussey and Marx later used some of these lyrics for their own bands, The Mission and Ghost Dance. An early recording of &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;, which, according to Gary Marx, was &quot;previously called &#x27;The Scottish One&#x27;&quot;, was &quot;completed pretty early on&quot;. Marx sang an early draft of the later Ghost Dance lyric of &quot;When I Call&quot;, which mentioned the name of a friend of the band&#x27;s from Hamburg; Marianne.

On &quot;Nine While Nine&quot;, which, according to Marx, was &quot;recorded at the same time&quot; and &quot;had the working title &#x27;Child of Light&quot;, Gary Marx sang a guide vocal which he reused later for the Ghost Dance song &quot;A Deeper Blue&quot;. The title of this song is derived from Yorkshire dialect where &quot;while&quot; is used to mean &quot;until&quot;. &quot;Black Planet&quot; exists in the form of an early version with a Wayne Hussey lyric which he later used for the Mission songs &quot;Dance on Glass&quot; and &quot;Naked and Savage&quot;. Additional songs which were left unused were the later Mission song &quot;Garden of Delight&quot; and later Ghost Dance song &quot;Yesterday Again&quot;. Eldritch later sang his own version of &quot;Garden of Delight&quot; which remained unused as well: &quot;There are a few bootlegs in existence of me trying to sing Wayne&#x27;s words, and you can hear that I&#x27;m not convinced by them. I can&#x27;t breathe any meaning into them.&quot; &quot;The guy didn&#x27;t have a clue – he&#x27;d just string buzz words together.&quot;

Recordings were delayed, to the frustration of the band as Eldritch was still working on lyrics. Gary Marx: &quot;He&#x27;d got far too caught up in the business and had lost his edge as a writer. We wasted weeks at a time in the studio, waiting for him to come up with a handful of lyrics. It was very painful and very expensive.&quot; A notable exception was &quot;Marian&quot;. Eldritch, inspired by Gary Marx&#x27;s original lyrics to &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;, wrote new words to a Wayne Hussey composition which contained a few passages sung in German. &quot;&#x27;Marian&#x27; is a very special song; it&#x27;s not like any of the other songs. I wrote it in ten minutes, usually the lyrics take me up to half a year.&quot; The vocal takes proved to be time-consumingly elaborate. Marx said, &quot;After each session Andy would say, &#x27;But is it epic?&#x27;, and we&#x27;d go, &#x27;Yeah Andy, it&#x27;s great!&#x27; And he&#x27;d go back and do it again. Andy&#x27;s a complete perfectionist.&quot; He added, &quot;We could write and record a double album in the time it took him to get the headphone mix to his liking.&quot;

At the end of July 1984, recordings were finished and the band had completed raw mixes of 18 songs on ten analogue master reels:
* Reel 1: &quot;Tones&quot;/&quot;No Time to Cry&quot;
* Reel 2: &quot;Emma&quot;/&quot;Walk Away&quot;
* Reel 3: &quot;Poison Door&quot;/&quot;A Rock and a Hard Place&quot;
* Reel 4: &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; (album version)/&quot;First and Last and Always&quot; (Japan version)
* Reel 5: &quot;Possession&quot;/&quot;Spit on Your Grave&quot;/&quot;Evil Come Evil Go&quot;
* Reel 6: &quot;Marian&quot;/&quot;Wide Receiver&quot;
* Reel 7: &quot;Nine While Nine&quot;
* Reel 8: &quot;Some Kind of Stranger&quot;
* Reel 9: &quot;Some Kind of Stranger&quot; (early)
* Reel 10: &quot;Down to E...&quot;/&quot;On the Wire&quot;

According to Dave Allen &quot;Tones&quot;, &quot;Spit on Your Grave&quot;, &quot;Evil Come Evil Go&quot; and &quot;Down to E...&quot; are working titles for known songs. &quot;Amphetamine Logic&quot;, according to Gary Marx, had the working title &quot;Horned One Stabs&quot;, which indicates that this song was not recorded at Strawberry but at later sessions. In early August 1984, the band flew to the US to play two concerts in New York.

===Genetic sessions===
After the US gigs, the band went into Genetic Studios near Reading with producer Dave Allen as planned to complete the album with engineer Tim Baldwin. But the sessions at Genetic Studios dissolved, according to Gary Marx, into &quot;madness of Eldritch walking into walls between vocal takes and us generally losing the plot. [Baldwin] seemed to remember it fondly enough.&quot; Weakened by continuous amphetamine use, insomnia, malnutrition and hypoglycaemia, Eldritch collapsed in the studio one night. Marx: &quot;He was completely exhausted; hallucinating. Despite this, part of him still wanted to carry on, although the other part knew that he had to stop because he was so ill.&quot; Eldritch: &quot;I enjoy it so much, being strung out for a very long time. I&#x27;m told you can&#x27;t do it for that long.&quot; Eldritch was rushed to the nearest hospital where he had to stay for a while because of heart complications and reduced general and nutritional condition. In time for two festival appearances in Germany in early September 1984, Eldritch was released from hospital, but the band couldn&#x27;t meet the scheduled release date of the album. During an interview in Ahlen on 8 September, Eldritch said the release had been postponed to the beginning of the next year.

The band then returned to Genetic Studios to put the finishing touches on the album. It was possibly at these sessions that the band recorded a studio version of the Bob Dylan song &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;; an indication of the band&#x27;s black humour. Studio versions of the two later Mission songs, &quot;Serpents Kiss&quot; and &quot;Wake&quot;, exist. Wayne Hussey: &quot;Both of these songs were actually first recorded during the sessions for [&quot;First and Last and Always&quot;], but weren&#x27;t completed at that time.&quot; It&#x27;s not clear whether these two songs were recorded at Strawberry or at Genetic Studios. On 22 September 1984, the band made an appearance at a festival in York and then went on the &quot;Black October&quot; tour through the UK and Europe from 4 October till 18 November 1984, which was originally set up to coincide with the release of the album. To coincide with the tour, a first single off the album was released on 8 October 1984, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, which included a limited edition flexidisc featuring an &quot;Amphetamix&quot; of the song &quot;Train&quot;. With the release schedule disrupted and the album postponed to the next year, the record company unsuccessfully requested to postpone &quot;Walk Away&quot; too. &quot;Walk Away&quot;, like its predecessor, failed to reach the UK top 40, reaching No. 45.

After the end of the tour, the band returned to Genetic Studios without bassist Craig Adams or producer Dave Allen to mix the album. On this occasion two new songs were recorded, &quot;Blood Money&quot; and &quot;Bury Me Deep&quot;, which were produced by Eldritch and were intended as B-sides for the next single, &quot;No Time to Cry&quot;. At the end of 1984, Eldritch also produced the mini-album &quot;Clash of Dreams&quot; by Salvation at Strawberry Recording Studios in Stockport, which was intended for a March 1985 release on his Merciful Release label. The album was shelved. After the Christmas break, the band spent January and February 1985 with preparations for the album release, which again had been postponed to March. The artwork was completed and delivered, and various tapes with different mixes to pick circulated at the WEA offices. Additionally, the band negotiated the release of a live video on PolyGram which was to be filmed on Gary Marx&#x27;s birthday on 18 June 1985 at the Royal Albert Hall. Around that time, lead guitarist and band co-founder Gary Marx decided to leave the group. &quot;My relationship to all three of them was completely shattered.&quot; &quot;As a songwriter it was a frustrating time in The Sisters. I wrote a lot of songs but they weren&#x27;t used.&quot; It had been presumed that Hussey should switch to keyboards, a step which Hussey would never have tolerated.

==Composition==
For the album sessions the band had acquired a new drum machine, an Oberheim DMX. The album lyrics were all written by Andrew Eldritch, who said his writing &quot;owes more to collage editing in film&quot;. Their content, with various references to drugs and separation, mirror Eldritch&#x27;s condition at the time: &quot;I was so shot when I wrote the lyrics on the album that there&#x27;s no distancing of persona at all.&quot; Gary Marx: &quot;When we were making [the album] Andrew was effectively splitting with his long-term girlfriend and I was close to leaving the band. [These] two things led to a number of references in the lyrics, which seemed to cover his farewells to us both.&quot; Eldritch later confirmed that the lyrics of &quot;Walk Away&quot; were directed to Gary Marx: &quot;I thought one of them in particular might have found it a bit relevant.&quot; Gary Marx: &quot;&#x27;Walk Away&#x27; may or may not be about me; I don&#x27;t care because I don&#x27;t particularly like the song. The one lyric which always bugs me is the line from &#x27;Some Kind of Stranger&#x27; which says &#x27;careful lingers undecided at the door&#x27;, which I definitely took as a shot at me.&quot;

==Release and aftermath==
On 8 March 1985, the single &quot;No Time to Cry&quot; was released, reached No. 63 on the UK chart. To coincide with the album release, a UK tour began on 9 March. On 11 March, WEA Records Ltd. released the album in the UK to positive press reactions. On 1 April, Marx played his last concert with The Sisters of Mercy, followed by a TV appearance the day after, during which the band played live in the studio versions of &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; and &quot;Marian&quot;. The remaining trio, with Wayne Hussey shouldering all guitar parts, started another tour through Europe and the US on 12 April, which continued till 7 June. A second TV appearance for German TV show &quot;&quot;, during which the band mimed to &quot;No Time to Cry&quot;, was broadcast on 15 April 1985. The Sisters of Mercy played their final concert as planned on 18 June 1985 at the Royal Albert Hall. Gary Marx, who was announced to take part, didn&#x27;t show up. The video was released in 1986 by PolyGram.

In the summer of 1985, the music press reported that The Sisters of Mercy were planning an ABBA cover version as their next single. Eldritch later confirmed that he had indeed contacted producer Jim Steinman: &quot;I called him up [in 1985] when the band had &#x27;Gimme Gimme Gimme&#x27; in their set and told him about the song and that our version had to be absolutely stupid. He agreed with me but he was booked out. And then the band broke up.&quot; On 2 November, the music press reported the band&#x27;s split. Andrew Eldritch: &quot;The people that are now The Mission and myself had an agreement: no one would use the name when the band went its separate ways.&quot; &quot;The band was good and successful, each of us could continue. The split came at a time when it wouldn&#x27;t do us any damage.&quot;

===Editions===
The original vinyl album was released in March 1985 in the UK, the US and Europe. In July 1985 &quot;Warner-Pioneer Corporation&quot; in Japan released a version of the album that contained different mixes of some tracks (&quot;Black Planet&quot; features slightly different instrumentation and is 10 seconds longer, &quot;No Time to Cry&quot; features different opening and ending instrumentation and sound effects, &quot;A Rock and a Hard Place&quot; features additional guitar tracks and a slightly different drum track, while &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; features a totally different drum track as well as a totally different arrangement and has an intro which is 15 seconds longer; the remaining tracks are identical to the standard vinyl release). In March 1988 the album was released on CD for the first time, but it was the Japanese version that was used. In May 1992 a digitally remastered version of the CD was released, again using the Japanese version.

In October 2006 a remastered version of the original vinyl album was released for the first time on CD. This CD edition featured some bonus tracks such as an early demo version of &quot;Some Kind of Stranger&quot; with different lyrics, plus the b sides of the singles &quot;Walk Away&quot; (&quot;Poison Door&quot;, &quot;On the Wire&quot; and &quot;Long Train&quot;) and &quot;No Time to Cry&quot; (&quot;Blood Money&quot; and &quot;Bury Me Deep&quot;). On 24 July 2015, a 4-LP vinyl box set was released by Warner Music International that included the original version of the album with three EPs from the era, all with reproduced artwork in a slipcase. The set was also released digitally.

==Reception==

===Critical===

John Leland of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote, &quot;Their songs are all dark, funereal—slow or fast, they all have the same relentlessly overcast timbre. They&#x27;re a talented bunch trapped inside a clichéd strategy. &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; isn&#x27;t bad, but it sure doesn&#x27;t reward attentive listening.&quot;

Amy Hanson of AllMusic praised the album and its influence on the goth scene that was prominent in the mid 80s, praising the mood of the album, saying, &quot;With static drumbeats and jangle-angled guitars backing Andrew Eldritch&#x27;s atonic, graveyard vocals, the songs on First and Last and Always paid to play alongside the ghosts of myriad forgotten post-punkers as well as the band&#x27;s own goth forebears.&quot; She praised the moods within the album, observing, &quot;From the opening air-fire claustrophobia of &quot;Black Planet&quot; to the melancholy &quot;No Time to Cry,&quot;&quot; and concluded &quot;Copied to death, its brilliance has never been replicated. Indeed, the entire album remains unequalled in the genre, permanently granted top place on a pedestal from which it cannot be toppled.&quot;

In a retrospective review, Julian Marszalek of The Quietus observed the lyrics, on the opening track &quot;Black Planet&quot; to be very on the nose, with regards to the political climate of the mid 80s along with the Cold War, saying. &quot;Lyrically, the track finds Eldtrich in a post-apocalyptic world polluted by radiation and acid rain.&quot;... &quot;But while Eldritch is bang on the money capturing the zeitgeist, the music was something of a damp squib focusing as it does on Hussey&#x27;s sound while paying scant regard to concepts such as memorable and powerful riffs.&quot; and praised the sound of the album saying &quot;With &quot;First And Last And Always&quot;, The Sisters Of Mercy delivered a document that fulfilled the promise of those earlier releases, ten tracks marked by Armageddon, women, drugs, cowboy hats and Marlboro Reds.&quot; and concluded &quot;Only The Sisters Of Mercy could&#x27;ve thought up the idea of rock music as an ironic vehicle for their bile. And only The Sisters Of Mercy could&#x27;ve been consumed by the very thing they were mocking. But regardless of what came next – and certainly the whip smart music that preceded it – The Sisters Of Mercy&#x27;s debut album is a mighty full stop and crowning statement that&#x27;s weathered the years well since its release. For some of us, at least, this really is first and last and always.&quot;

===Commercial===
The production of the album left the band in enormous debt. According to Eldritch, the album recouped the production costs in 1988. The album peaked at No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart, with strong regional sales in the north of England. It was certified silver (with 60,000 sold) on 30 October 1987 and gold (with 100,000 sold) on 8 May 1989 by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In Germany, the group&#x27;s second largest market after the UK, the album peaked at No. 40 and was certified gold (with 250,000 sold) in 2011. In the US, the album did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Regarding the failure of the band&#x27;s singles to crack the UK top 40, Eldritch later commented: &quot;We came close. Our failure to crack it wasn&#x27;t anything to do with us. I think the band did everything required, although we weren&#x27;t prepared to package ourselves in the way other acts were&quot;.

==Legacy==
Despite the album and the band&#x27;s significant impact on the goth scene in the 1980s, with the band being regarded as the second wave of the goth movement along with other bands such as The Mission and Fields of the Nephilim, Andrew Eldritch did not consider The Sisters of Mercy as gothic rock band, and instead wanted them to be classified as a continuation of 1960s classic rock music:

We come from 1969; we are the children of Altamont. We don&#x27;t know who the fuck Alien Sex Fiend are and we don&#x27;t want to know. Throughout our career, we&#x27;ve had to fight against the preconception that most of the public has of us as being something that sprang out of post-punk. We regard ourselves as having sprung from pre-1970s rock music, as the inheritors of that tradition and the only people with any chance of propagating it further.

I think the title track is gloomy but not the others. They may not be tremendously optimistic...gloomy and doomy suggest an air of apathetic resignation, which I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re prone to.

In 2012, a retrospective by the &quot;Sonic Seducer&quot; magazine called the album a &quot;pillar of the goth culture&quot; and included it in a list of &quot;10 Key Albums for the Gothic Scene&quot;. The band have also been credited as a goth band on various lists of this nature.

<text>Alain Robidoux (born July 25, 1960) is a Canadian retired professional snooker player. Robidoux played on the sport&#x27;s main tour from 1987 to 2004, and reached the final of the 1996 German Open, which he lost 7–9 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

==Career==
Robidoux was born on 25 July 1960 in Canada. He joined the professional snooker circuit in the 1987–88 snooker season as a &quot;non-tournament&quot; professional. This entitled him to play only in the World Championship. He amassed enough points in the 1988 World Championship qualifiers to finish in the top 128 players, which allowed him to join the tour full-time.

In September 1988, Robidoux became only the sixth player ever to record an officially ratified 147 maximum break, achieved in the qualifying rounds of the European Open. He won the Canadian Professional Championship by defeating Jim Wych 8–4 in the final. He reached the semi-finals of the Grand Prix in October 1988, where he won six consecutive frames from 1–8 down against Alex Higgins, but ultimately lost the match 7–9.

In the first round of the 1996 World Championship, Robidoux was beaten 3–10 by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in a controversial match. Although predominantly right-handed, O&#x27;Sullivan played a number of shots with his left hand, and the behaviour was described by commentator John Virgo as O&#x27;Sullivan &quot;taking the mick&quot;. The matter came to a head in the eleventh frame, when Robidoux was 2–8 down and he was declining to concede the frame, instead continuing to despite a 43-point deficit with only the and on the table. He refused to shake O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s hand at the end of the match. In response, O&#x27;Sullivan claimed that he played better with his left hand than Robidoux could with his right. Realising that O&#x27;Sullivan was able to play equally well with both hands, Robidoux later apologised to him.

In the 1996–97 season, Robidoux reached the final of the 1996 German Open, but he lost 7–9 to O&#x27;Sullivan despite making a tournament-best 145 break. That same season, he progressed to the semi-finals of the 1997 World Snooker Championship, defeating Brian Morgan, Stefan Mazrocis and Lee Walker, before losing to eventual champion Ken Doherty. He finished the season 9th in the world rankings, which was to be his career-best ranking position. However he then endured a torrid 1997–98 season, losing all his matches and did not win a match again until the following season at the 1999 Welsh Open, where he reached the last 16.

He lost his professional status in 2004 after placing 102nd in the rankings. Robidoux blamed his decline on the destruction of his favourite cue, which he referred to as &quot;the Eel&quot;. When he returned the cue to the man from whom he had bought it to have it mended, the man objected to Robidoux having fixed a sponsor&#x27;s logo to the butt and smashed the cue to pieces. Several years later, Robidoux was asked whether the passage of time had eased his anger towards the cue maker; he responded &quot;I want to kill him.&quot;

<text>Banco Atlántico, S.A. was a bank in Barcelona. In 2003 Banco Atlántico became part of the Banco Sabadell Group.

==History==
In 1901, shortly after Cuba gained independence from Spain, José and Francisco Nonell y Feliu, who had been operating a currency exchange business in Cuba since 1885, relocated their business to Barcelona. In collaboration with local merchants, they established a bank called &quot;Nonell, Rovira y Matas&quot;, which aimed to facilitate the investment of repatriated funds from Cuba into local securities.

By 1917, the bank had changed its name to &quot;Nonell Hermanos&quot;, and in the 1920s, it was further rebranded as &quot;Banca Nonell&quot;. In 1946, Claudio Güell y Churruca, the Count of Ruiseñada, took control of the bank and renamed it Banco Atlántico.

In 1961, the descendants of Güell sold their shares to a new group of investors. During this time, Continental Illinois Bank acquired a stake in Banco Atlántico. However, ownership eventually passed to Rumasa, a holding company owned by José María Ruiz Mateos.

In 1975, Banco Atlántico expanded its international presence by establishing an agency in New York, which remained operational until its closure in 2001.

In 1983, the Spanish Socialist government under Felipe González and Miguel Boyer nationalized Rumasa, including Banco Atlántico. At the time, Rumasa was a conglomerate of 20 banks and approximately 300 other companies, and its financial troubles were too large for the Corporación Bancaria to manage. By this point, Banco Atlántico had become the 10th largest bank in Spain, with 172 domestic branches, an agency in New York, a branch in Grand Cayman, two subsidiaries in Switzerland and Panama, and representative offices in eight countries.

In 1984, the Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), in partnership with BBVA and Allianz, acquired Banco Atlántico from the government. Following the acquisition, Banco Atlántico expanded its private banking operations by adding subsidiaries in the Bahamas, Gibraltar, and Monaco, while divesting its subsidiary in Switzerland. Eventually, Banco Exterior replaced BBVA and Allianz as shareholders.

In 1999, BBVA regained partial ownership of Banco Atlántico after acquiring Argentaria, a group of banks created by the Spanish government, including Banco Exterior.

In 2003, Banco Sabadell acquired and absorbed Banco Atlántico, outbidding several competitors, including Barclays Bank and Caixa Geral de Depositos of Portugal.

<text>In topology, the Sorgenfrey plane is a frequently-cited counterexample to many otherwise plausible-sounding conjectures. It consists of the product of two copies of the Sorgenfrey line, which is the real line formula_1 under the half-open interval topology. The Sorgenfrey line and plane are named for the American mathematician Robert Sorgenfrey.

A basis for the Sorgenfrey plane, denoted formula_2 from now on, is therefore the set of rectangles that include the west edge, southwest corner, and south edge, and omit the southeast corner, east edge, northeast corner, north edge, and northwest corner. Open sets in formula_2 are unions of such rectangles.

formula_2 is an example of a space that is a product of Lindelöf spaces that is not itself a Lindelöf space. The so-called anti-diagonal formula_5 is an uncountable discrete subset of this space, and this is a non-separable subset of the separable space formula_2. It shows that separability does not inherit to closed subspaces. Note that formula_7 and formula_8 are closed sets; it can be proved that they cannot be separated by open sets, showing that formula_2 is not normal. Thus it serves as a counterexample to the notion that the product of normal spaces is normal; in fact, it shows that even the finite product of perfectly normal spaces need not be normal.

It is unique for having track conditions that change throughout the race due to the race having a day to night transition, (if the race occurs on schedule with no delays or postponements). The race starts around 6:20 p.m. when the track is bathed in sunlight for about the first third of the race. Roughly the second third happens at dusk, and about the final third of the race occurs at night under the lights.

The race is run later on the same day as the Indianapolis 500 of the IndyCar Series, with multiple drivers having performed or attempted Double Duty, competing in both races. No driver has ever won both races, either on the same day or across their career.

The NASCAR event is usually held on the last weekend of May and is known as one of the largest weekends in auto racing, as the NASCAR race occurs on the same Sunday after the Monaco Grand Prix (Formula One) and the Indianapolis 500 (IndyCar Series).

Christopher Bell is the defending champion of the Coca-Cola 600.

==Track origin==
In the spring of 1959, Curtis Turner returned to Charlotte, North Carolina, after viewing Bill France Sr.&#x27;s Daytona International Speedway and had an idea of building a race track in the surrounding area. Turner thought he could borrow enough money to build a $750,000 track with 45,000 permanent seats on his property in Cabarrus County, North Carolina. Afterward, he learned that a group led by Bruton Smith had a similar idea to build a track near Pineville.

Smith and Turner formed an alliance to build the track, and they signed a contract with NASCAR to run a 600-mile event on Memorial Day. Once the construction crew broke ground, they found a layer of granite under the topsoil, making the construction costs raise. The area for the first turn alone used $70,000 worth of dynamite, ballooning Turner&#x27;s $750,000 construction plan to nearly two million dollars. In the spring of 1960, Turner begged for a six-week postponement of the race after a snowstorm delayed the concrete pouring.

With two weeks remaining until the inaugural race, the paving subcontractor threatened to quit the job due to lack of payment. To keep him there, Turner and one of his friends threatened the subcontractor with a shotgun and a revolver to ensure the track&#x27;s backstretch would be completed. The first event at the newly completed Charlotte Motor Speedway was held on June 19, 1960.

==History==
The event began as an attempt by NASCAR to stage a Memorial Day weekend event to compete with the open-wheel Indianapolis 500. It was not until 1974, however, that both races competed head-to-head on the same day, due to Indianapolis&#x27; policy of not racing on Sundays prior to that. Before 1974, the two races were held on different days of the week, and on a few occasions, some drivers drove in both. They continued even after the Coca-Cola 600 was moved to the same day, albeit to a lesser degree. The first World 600 was held on June 16 due to construction delays of the completion of Charlotte Motor Speedway. The 2009 race, postponed by rain from its original May 24 date, was the first race to occur on Memorial Day itself.

After the installation of lights in 1992, fans asked circuit management to start the race later in the day because of the notorious North Carolina heat and humidity. They wanted to follow The Winston&#x27;s popularity the previous week and switch the race to a nighttime finish to create cooler temperatures for spectators. The start time was moved back several times throughout the 1990s and finally settled at 5:30 pm in 2001, to attempt to have the race finished by 10 pm ET, in time for local news on Fox affiliates.

With the new starting time came new challenges. Not only do race teams have to deal with the blistering Carolina heat, but the considerable temperature drop at night affects track conditions.

The nighttime portion of the race is lit with a system that uses parabolic reflectors so that dangerous glare that would otherwise be in the drivers&#x27; eyes is minimized. The move of the race to the early evening made it possible for drivers to do Double Duty – run the Indianapolis 500, then immediately fly from Indianapolis to Charlotte, and participate in the Coca-Cola 600. Experts disagreed over whether, for health and safety reasons, anyone should be allowed to race 1100 miles in one day, but no regulation has been set by any governing body to prevent it. From 2005 to 2010, the issue became moot when the state of Indiana finally decided to implement daylight saving time. This resulted in only an approximately one-hour interval between the end of the Indianapolis 500 and the start of the Coca-Cola 600. The Indianapolis 500 start time was moved back to noon Eastern in 2011, since 2011, only 2 drivers have attempted the Double Duty, with the most recent being Kyle Larson in 2024, however, due to rain, he was unable to race in the Coca-Cola 600.

Until the Ferko lawsuit settlement took effect, the race was considered the third leg of the grand slam and was once part of the Winston Million. It is considered one of the top five annual NASCAR races.

Beginning in 2017, NASCAR adopted the stage-racing format, dividing each of its top three division&#x27;s races into three stages. Originally, the 600 was going to have stages 1 &amp; 2 be 115 laps in length, with the third and final stage encompassing the remaining 170 laps. Just a few weeks before the race, the stage format for the race was changed with the addition of a fourth stage, and the race is divided into four uniform stages of 100 laps each. This makes it the only race on the schedule with four stages instead of three. If the weather interferes, NASCAR&#x27;s rule that a race becomes official after the conclusion of the second stage still applies. It also makes the Coca-Cola 600 the highest scoring race in terms of points a driver can collect. Usually, if a driver sweeps all the stages and passes inspection they score 60 points (40 for winning, and 10 for the first two stages), but with 4 stages the maximum is 70 (which Kyle Busch accomplished in 2018 and Kyle Larson accomplished in 2021).

As part of the race’s annual tribute to the United States military, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (performed by the Charlotte Fire Department Pipe Band) and &quot;Taps&quot; are played prior to the National Anthem in memory of members of the Armed Forces who lost their life in the line of duty.

==Name changes==
From 1960 to 1984 the race was known as the World 600. In 1985, the race&#x27;s name was changed to Coca-Cola World 600. In 1986 the name was shortened to the Coca-Cola 600, or Coke 600 for short. The name changed again in 2002 to the Coca-Cola Racing Family 600 referring to the Coca-Cola family of drivers who are sponsored by Coca-Cola. In 2003, the name returned to the Coca-Cola 600.

==Individual race details==

*1960: In the inaugural World 600 in 1960, Don O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s Pontiac smashed the driver&#x27;s door of Lenny Page&#x27;s Chevy. Lenny Page was lucky to even survive the impact, and was in critical condition afterward. Reporter Chris Economaki rushed to the scene and applied CPR until safety crews arrived. He was later credited with saving Lenny&#x27;s life.
*1961: The race saw numerous crashes, including a very bad collision involving Reds Kagle, who lost a leg when his Ford smashed through the guardrail in Turn Three. David Pearson lost almost all of a multi-lap lead when a tire popped coming to the white flag but finished the race as winner, his first in Grand National racing. 
*1964: Fireball Roberts suffered a hard crash in this race, resulting in an inferno. Roberts was severely burned and would die of complications on July 2 of that year.
*1974: The race was shortened to 540 miles because of the nation&#x27;s short-lived fuel crisis, which was won by David Pearson over Richard Petty. The lead changed 37 times between Pearson, Petty, Cale Yarborough, Buddy Baker, and Donnie Allison, the most lead changes in the event&#x27;s history to that point.
*1975: Richard Petty, after years of frustration, finally collected his first victory at the World 600, proceeding to lap the field. Additionally; another future seven-time champion, Dale Earnhardt, made his Cup Series debut; finishing 21st, one position ahead of his future boss Richard Childress.
*1976: Bruton Smith resumed full control of the speedway with the resignation of former track president Richard Howard. In a move to boost promotion of the race, Janet Guthrie was entered in a car wrenched by Ralph Moody. Pearson edged Petty again after a cut tire dropped Yarborough off the lead lap.
*1977: Two racing legends won races on the same day. Richard Petty win his second World 600, while A. J. Foyt was winning his fourth at Indy.
*1978: Darrell Waltrip won the first of his record five 600s in 1978 in a race-long six-car shootout; on the final lap Benny Parsons and David Pearson crashed. The lead changed 43 times, the most competitive 600 to that point of its history.
*1979: The race saw the most lead changes (59) in the race&#x27;s history. Darrell Waltrip took the win over Richard Petty and rookie Dale Earnhardt.
*1980: The race lasted seven hours due to 14 caution flags and two lengthy red flags for rain. Multiple tire failures helped lead to an epidemic of wrecks; at Lap 275 Dale Earnhardt blew a tire and his spin caught up Bobby Allison, Cale Yarborough, and David Pearson. Waltrip had the lead but in the final 20 laps was challenged by Benny Parsons; the two battled with the lead changing some seven times before Parsons edged Waltrip by a car length.
*1982: Neil Bonnett won his first World 600 driving the famous No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford.
*1983: Jim Vandiver&#x27;s final race, with Neil Bonnett winning his second World 600 driving the No. 75 Rahmoc-Hodgdon Chevrolet.
*1985: Considerable pre-race hype surrounded the race as Bill Elliott entered with a chance to win a million-dollar cash bonus for a &quot;small slam&quot; of the sport&#x27;s four majors. Elliott won the pole position and led 81 laps, but faded to 18th at the finish. Darrell Waltrip took the victory, a key victory en route to the championship. Waltrip (who won the inaugural All-Star race a day earlier) nearly missed the race after a car/engine swap controversy with NASCAR Director of Competition Dick Beatty. Elliott went on to win the Winston Million later in the season at Darlington but never won the 600 in his career.
*1988: In the middle of a tire war between the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Hoosier Racing Tire (now part of Continental AG), multiple tire failures marred the previous week&#x27;s All-Star race, all involving Goodyear. Goodyear withdrew the tires originally designated for the 600 and substituted a harder compound. Only Dave Marcis stayed with the harder Goodyear tires for the 600. But during the 600, Hoosier tire failures were rampant. Darrell Waltrip survived and edged Rusty Wallace for the win, becoming the first four-time winner of the race.
*1989: Darrell Waltrip becomes the only driver to win the event for a record 5th time (1978, 1979, 1985, 1988, 1989). After also winning the season-opening Daytona 500, Waltrip now had won two of the sport&#x27;s four majors, setting himself up for the million-dollar bonus for a small slam at Darlington. He would not be successful. (Waltrip had not won the final major, Darlington, and never took the checkered flag to win the Southern 500; his final career win, at that race in 1992, took place when he took the lead during pit stops on Lap 293 and the race was suspended by a red flag after 298 laps for rain, after which it was never completed.)
*1992: The race saw a controversial finish. Dale Earnhardt emerged from late green-flag pit stops with the lead after trailing by some three seconds entering the pits; there were complaints from several teams, notably Morgan-McClure Motorsports whose driver Ernie Irvan finished second, that Earnhardt had broken NASCAR&#x27;s mandated pit road speed limit. This race, the last Coca-Cola 600 to be run entirely in daylight, marked the only victory for Earnhardt in 1992.
*1993: Earnhardt was plagued by controversy again by first getting busted for speeding on pit road, then penalized a lap for aggressive driving after spinning out the lapped car of Greg Sacks. On a pit stop, he was penalized for not having all 5 lug nuts tightened, when in fact all 5 were tight. NASCAR threw the caution after the debacle, but Earnhardt made up the two laps he was down to take the lead late in the race on his way to his third Coca-Cola 600 win. This was also the first Coca-Cola 600 to start late in the day and end under the lights, which has been done since.
*1994: Second-year driver Jeff Gordon won the first race of his career. His team gambled on the final pit stop, taking on only two tires, giving him a better track position.
*1995: The race was a dramatic affair as the lead changed 32 times, the most since 1988, and the battle for the lead became a spirited multi-lap affair between Bobby Labonte, Dale Earnhardt, Rusty Wallace, and Sterling Marlin. Labonte punted Earnhardt out of the lead late in the race and sweated out late green-flag stops for fuel to take the win, his first in Winston Cup.
*1999: Dale Earnhardt Jr. made his Winston Cup Series debut in this race.
*2000: Talk this year was of Dale Earnhardt Jr. trying to be the first rookie to win the race, winning the pole and dominating all of the phases of the race. However, Matt Kenseth became the first rookie to win the race after holding off Bobby Labonte over the final laps. It was Kenseth&#x27;s first career win.
*2001: While Jeff Burton won the race, Tony Stewart stunned the racing world by successfully pulling off the full distances of the Memorial Day Double.
*2005: During this race, a new record for the most cautions of any NASCAR Cup Series race was set at 22 cautions. In addition, there was a red flag late in the race because of debris. On the last lap, Jimmie Johnson slid past Bobby Labonte in turn four, claiming the checkered flag by inches. In doing so he became the first driver to win three consecutive Coca-Cola 600s. He would finish a distant second to Kasey Kahne the following year.
*2007: In one of NASCAR&#x27;s biggest upsets, Casey Mears won. Tony Stewart led with ten laps remaining, hoping to win his first Coca-Cola 600, but had to pit for fuel with 8 laps left, giving the lead to Dale Earnhardt Jr. until he ran out of fuel. Denny Hamlin led with seven laps remaining until he also ran out of fuel. Mears, driving for Hendrick Motorsports in the 25, took the lead for six laps remaining to win, running out of fuel just after crossing the finish line. The entire podium consisted of J. J. Yeley (2nd) and Kyle Petty (third). It was the final podium result for all three drivers. Reed Sorenson (4th) and Brian Vickers (5th) completed the top five.
*2009: Although nicknamed the 24 Hours of Charlotte, it was the shortest run of the race in its history. The race was delayed from Sunday to Monday due to a rainstorm, and the following day, more rain forced the race to end at only 227 laps, although it took a six and a half hour marathon to reach that point, due to frequent interruptions by competition cautions and three red flags, including a two-hour period under the red flag which ended the race and declared David Reutimann the winner, one of few drivers who opted not to pit under the final caution. Reutimann was the second surprise first-time winner in 2009 after Brad Keselowski&#x27;s win at Talladega the month before.
*2011: The 2011 running, at 603 miles, was the longest distance in NASCAR history at the time. Dale Earnhardt Jr., trying to break a long winless drought, ran out of gas coming off of turn 4, and Kevin Harvick scored his third win of 2011.
*2013: The 2013 running was red-flagged 126 laps in, when a cable that supported a Skycam used by Fox Sports over the front stretch of the race track, snapped and fell onto the racing surface. Several spectators were injured as a result of the failure, and several race cars were damaged. The race restarted but was red-flagged again on lap 325 for a large wreck entering turn one. Kevin Harvick won the race for the second time when he took two tires on the final caution and passed Kasey Kahne, who did not pit.
*2014: Jimmie Johnson won his fourth Coca-Cola 600, and first since 2005. During the race, the world&#x27;s biggest photo was captured. The 348-gigapixel image captured during the race is 70,000 times bigger than a standard self-portrait and allows each and every one of the more than 100,000 fans in the stands who attended the event to zoom in on the 360-degree image and find themselves.
*2015: Carl Edwards won his first Coca-Cola 600 and first while driving for Joe Gibbs Racing.
*2016: Martin Truex Jr. started on the pole and led an event record 392 of 400 laps and a series record 588 of 600 miles en route to his first win at the Coca-Cola 600. Additionally, the race was the fastest-ran Coca-Cola 600 in history at an average speed of 160.655, clocking in at 3 hours, 44 minutes, and 5 seconds.
*2017: First race to run in four stages rather than three. Austin Dillon, running on fumes, held off Kyle Busch to score his first career Cup win. The race also marked the return of the #3 to victory lane for the first time since Dale Earnhardt scored his final career victory at Talladega in 2000. Just before halfway, a rainstorm happened to delay the race for an hour and 30 mins. With the delay, the race finished at 12:30 am EDT on Memorial Day Monday. Danica Patrick leads 7 laps becoming the first woman to lead the Coca-Cola 600.
*2018: Kyle Busch dominated the race by winning sweeping all the stages, and leading 377 of the 400 laps to score his first career win at Charlotte, making him the first driver to win a race at every racetrack in the Cup Series that he has competed at, and every track that is on the current schedule.
*2019: 21-year-old William Byron was the youngest driver ever to take pole position for the Coca-Cola 600. With 16 caution flags and an elapsed time of 4 hours and 50 minutes, this running of the race became the longest since 2005, since surpassed by 2022’s running. 
*2020: With government restrictions over COVID-19 pandemic affecting all sports across America, NASCAR continued after a two-month absence, but it also prohibited fans in the stands. Chase Elliott looked like he was going to win the event until his teammate William Byron spun bringing out the caution with just two laps to go. Elliott decided to pit with others while Brad Keselowski stayed out inheriting the lead for a green-white-checkered finish. Elliott charged from 11th to 3rd with Keselowski giving Roger Penske his second 600 win over Jimmie Johnson on a day in which the Indianapolis 500 was postponed due to the pandemic. In post-race tech, Johnson&#x27;s car violated rear-end alignments disqualifying him from 2nd to dead last (40th) and lifting Elliott to second. Rain delayed the event by an hour and forty minutes just 50 laps in, with the checkered-flag waving at just past midnight on Memorial Day. The race ending in overtime broke the record for the longest NASCAR race run set in 2011. Keselowski crossed the start/finish line after completing 405 laps/607.5 miles, breaking the 2011 record of 402 laps/603 miles.
*2022: The 2022 running, at 619.5 miles, brought on by two overtime finishes, broke the record for the longest NASCAR race by 12 miles. With 18 caution flags and an elapsed time of five hours and 13 minutes, this running surpassed 2019 as the longest running of the race since 2005, coming 46 seconds of race time shy of being longer than that race.

==First-time winners==

<text>The Amiga 3000T is a computer manufactured by Commodore. It is closely related to the Amiga 3000, although it came in a tower case which offers greater expandability. The case for the prototype, the 3500, was derived from Commodore&#x27;s PC compatible line.

Like the desktop variant it is based upon, the A3000T has a CPU FAST slot which allows for processor upgrades. Later models were offered with a 68040 CPU in this slot, and third-party upgrades can be used to add a PowerPC processor.

The A3000T has a variety of drive bays two 3.5-inch drives and one 5.25-inch half-height drive, mounted horizontally; and two 5.25-inch half-height drives mounted vertically. Inside, behind these bays, there is space for two more, internal, 5.25-inch half-height drives. The available drive bays make it possible to internally install up to seven drives in the A3000T.

The A3000T&#x27;s specifications closely resemble the horizontal-cased Amiga 3000, but the motherboard has been heavily redesigned. As a result, the expansion-slot layout is more like the Amiga 2000&#x27;s with five Zorro III slots, one of which is inline with the video slot, and four 16-bit ISA slots (passive), two of which are inline with Zorro slots (activated with bridgeboards).

At introduction, the retail price of an Amiga 3000 system could exceed $5000, depending on configuration. As a result of its high price and poor marketing, the machine did not sell in great numbers.

The machine is reported to have sold 14,380 units in Germany (including Amiga 3000 sales).

<text>Mustafa Gündoğdu (; born 2 October 1966), best known under his stage name Mousse T., is a German-Turkish DJ, record producer, film music composer and judge on season 15 of &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, the German version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. 

He is best known for the 1998 house hit &quot;Horny &#x27;98&quot; (featuring &quot;Hot &#x27;n&#x27; Juicy&quot; and famous for the hook &quot;I&#x27;m horny&quot;) and for his collaboration with Tom Jones on the 2000 pop hit &quot;Sex Bomb&quot;, from Jones&#x27; 1999 album &quot;Reload&quot;.

Mousse T. is one of the first producers of house music in his country, alongside contemporaries Boris Dlugosch, DJ Tonka and Ian Pooley.

== Biography ==
Mustafa Gündoğdu was born in 1966 in Hagen, then in West Germany, to Turkish parents. He started learning music aged 13. He began his career in 1990 as keyboardist for a small band known as &quot;Fun Key B&quot;. He began to use the moniker Mousse T. since 1994 and at the same time he set up his own recording studio and began DJing in the city of Hannover. Besides working on his own productions, usually with partner Errol Rennalls, he also wrote and produced tracks for other artists. In 1993, Mousse T. founded, along with Rennalls, Peppermint Jam Records, a record label specializing in uplifting house and melodic Acid jazz music.

His 1998 song &quot;Horny &#x27;98&quot; featuring Hot &#x27;n&#x27; Juicy (and with a chorus sung by Inaya Day on vocals) reached the top of the Billboard dance charts in the late 1990s and Top 20 in the UK and Australia. The track was also featured on &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot;. Mousse T.&#x27;s first album, &quot;Gourmet de Funk&quot;, was released in 2002. In 2004, he once again entered the Single Charts with his song &quot;Is It &#x27;Cos I&#x27;m Cool?&quot; (featuring Emma Lanford, a former Hot &#x27;n&#x27; Juicy member), which was featured on his second album, &quot;All Nite Madness&quot;, also released in 2004. In the same year Mousse T. produced the summer hit &quot;Il Grande Baboomba&quot;, of the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari, from the latter&#x27;s album &quot;Zu &amp; Co.&quot;, and he took part in the concert at the Royal Albert Hall, held in London in May 2004, with the other guests of the Italian bluesman.

In 2005, Mousse T. performed with Emma Lanford and represented Lower Saxony in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2005 with the song &quot;Right About Now&quot;, placing 4th with 85 points. In 2006, &quot;Loo &amp; Placido&quot; released a mash-up called &quot;Horny as a Dandy&quot;. The song fused the vocals of &quot;Horny &#x27;98&quot; and the music of &quot;Bohemian Like You&quot; by The Dandy Warhols.

Also in 2006, he collaborated with another German-born Turkish artist, singer Tarkan, and composed three different remixes for the track Start the Fire, from Tarkan&#x27;s album Come Closer, released on April 7, in that year. In 2007, Mousse T. wrote and produced the music for Marc Rothemund&#x27;s film: &quot;Pornorama&quot;. His music has been featured in several films and TV series in both the U.S. and internationally.

In 2018, he joined the jury of &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, the German equivalent to &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. In 2020, Mousse T. was ranked number one at the Top House Artists of 2020 by Traxsource. In 2022, he produced Gianni Morandi&#x27;s song &quot;Apri tutte le porte&quot;, written by Jovanotti and presented at the Sanremo Music Festival in the same year.

<doc id="682866" wikidata="Q5497707" url="?curid=682866" title="Frederick Eaton">
<text>Frederick Eaton (1856 – March 11, 1934) was a major individual in the transformation and expansion of Los Angeles in the latter 19th century through early 20th century, in California. Eaton was the political mastermind behind the early 20th century Los Angeles Aqueduct project, designed by William Mulholland.

==Introduction==
Frederick Eaton was born in Los Angeles in 1856, into a prominent family who were among those that founded what has become the city of Pasadena. As an adult Eaton was a Radical Republican. He was a promoter of the Civil War Reconstruction, new railroads, and Southern California water supplies. He became the Mayor of Los Angeles.

==Accomplishments==
Fred Eaton taught himself engineering and was the superintendent of the Los Angeles City Water Company by age 19 in 1875. As head of the Water Company, in 1878 Eaton first hired William Mulholland as a ditch-digger for distribution canals from the Los Angeles River to the city.

In 1886 Eaton redesigned and renovated Los Angeles Park, present day Pershing Square, with an &#x27;official park plan,&#x27; and it was renamed 6th Street Park.

===Los Angeles Aqueduct===
Eaton was the Los Angeles mayor from 1898 to 1900. For the office, he ran on the platform of establishing a new municipal water system for the city of Los Angeles. One year later in 1899, a 2.09 million US dollar bond measure was approved by city voters for the purchase of Los Angeles City Water Company&#x27;s system. (the private water company that leased the city&#x27;s waterworks and provided water to the city) A few years later, Los Angeles was faced with a problem: a burgeoning population that threatened the city&#x27;s water supply. Desperate to find a new water source for the city, Eaton recalled a camping trip in the Sierras where he &quot;gazed down upon the Owens Lake and thought about all the freshwater flowing into it and going to waste. Yes, Los Angeles was some 200 miles away, but it was all downhill. All one would have to do to move it to the city was dig some canals, lay some pipe and let gravity do the rest.&quot; In other words, Eaton realized an opportunity to sustain Los Angeles&#x27; growth and took matter into his own hands to save the city.

In 1906, the Board of Water Commissioners created the Bureau of Los Angeles Aqueduct. They appointed William Mulholland as chief engineer, who planned and developed the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The aqueduct was completed in 1913. The Aqueduct brought plentiful water to Los Angeles, which supplied its explosive population growth. It also diverted the Owens River and its tributaries, taking water away from the Owens Valley, eventually disabling the farms and communities there.

====Controversy====
During the time that Eaton was surveying the Owens Valley land for his personal water project, the federal government was also in the process of reclaiming land in that area for a large irrigation system in response to the newly signed Newlands Reclamation Act. Many local farmers willingly gave up their land to make this project possible. However, since Eaton was also buying thousands of acres of land at the same time, &quot;it was a common but ill-founded assumption in the valley that Eaton was representing the Reclamation Service. Eaton did nothing to correct the inference that his activity in the valley was related to the government project.&quot; In addition to knowingly withholding information, Eaton used inside information from Joseph Lippincott, the regional engineer of the Reclamation Service, to help gain the water rights.

The underhanded process of Los Angeles gaining the water rights for Owens Valley angered many residents. By 1924, when Los Angeles had taken so much water from the valley that Owens Lake dried up, the farmers and ranchers rebelled. They turned to violence and dynamited the aqueduct&#x27;s concrete canal.

===Round Valley – St. Francis Dam===
Fred Eaton used his inside advance information about the aqueduct project to enrich himself and his associates at the expense of the city of Los Angeles and the Owens Valley landowners. Eaton claimed in a 1905 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Express&quot; that he turned over all his water rights to Los Angeles without being paid for them, &quot;except that I retained the cattle which I had been compelled to take in making the deals . . . and mountain pasture land of no value except for grazing purposes.&quot; A portion of the land owned by Eaton was originally planned by Mulholland and Los Angeles to be used to build a storage reservoir. The Round Valley, Eaton&#x27;s &quot;mountain pasture land,&quot; was strategically located on the Owens River in Inyo County upstream of the Owens River Gorge and Owens Valley, and an excellent site to purchase. Eventually, Eaton&#x27;s demands for a million dollars to sell it became so entrenched that they ruptured his relationship with Mulholland.

William Mulholland refused to authorize the purchase and explored other areas to build the reservoir. Eventually he settled on an area which he had considered for a potential dam site during the process of designing and building the Los Angeles Aqueduct, a section of San Francisquito Canyon located north of the present day Santa Clarita Valley, and built the St. Francis Dam. In March 1928, the dam catastrophically failed due to unknown weak bedrock formations. The flood caused much destruction and many deaths downstream along the Santa Clara River. Eaton&#x27;s finances crumbled, also in 1928, and his ranch was acquired by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, where Crowley Lake was created for the aqueduct system&#x27;s new storage.

Fred Eaton died in Los Angeles in 1934.

<text>Standing Royal Navy deployments is a list of operations and commitments undertaken by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy on a worldwide basis. The following list details these commitments and deployments sorted by region and in alphabetical order. Routine deployments made by the Navy&#x27;s nuclear-powered submarines and their location of operations is classified.

Previously, before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in 2020 (&quot;Brexit,&quot;) the Royal Navy sent vessels to Operation Atalanta, a European Union multinational task force charged to combat Somali piracy off the Horn of Africa. For a period, the operation&#x27;s headquarters was located in the United Kingdom at Northwood Headquarters, London. In November 2017 Major General Charles Stickland Royal Marines was appointed as Operation Commander of Operation Atlanta.

==Atlantic==

===Antarctic Patrol===

Antarctic Patrol is undertaken during the regional summer by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Icebreaker and survey ship, , in the South Atlantic Ocean. Its primary mission is &quot;&quot;surveying and gathering data on the seas around Antarctica&quot; while also providing support to the British Antarctic Survey operation stationed in and around the British Antarctic Territory. A Royal Research Ship is also deployed during the regional summer; RRS &quot;Sir David Attenborough&quot;.

===Atlantic Patrol Tasking North===

Formerly known as the West Indies Guard Ship, the remnant of the former America and West Indies Station. This is the Royal Navy&#x27;s commitment to secure and protect the interests of the United Kingdom and British Overseas Territories in the regions of the North Atlantic and the Caribbean. The deployment primarily conducts counter narcotics missions and provides humanitarian assistance during hurricane season.

This tasking was augmented by Operation Ruman in 2017 as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Irma.

The task is typically carried out by a single warship, or more recently by a River-class patrol vessel or a Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel. Since 2020 has been assigned permanently to the Caribbean.

===Atlantic Patrol Tasking South===
The Royal Navy has maintained a permanent presence in the South Atlantic and West Africa to provide &quot;ongoing protection and reassurance to British interests&quot;&quot; such as the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, while also supporting British Forces South Atlantic Islands. The commitment has, at times, consisted of two warships; either a guided-missile destroyer or frigate accompanied by a Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel. Since 2015, a major warship has not been deployed. As of 2020, the commitment is maintained by the Offshore Patrol Vessel . The 2021 defence white paper indicated that henceforth, one River-class offshore patrol vessel, , would be permanently based in Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean and also in the Gulf of Guinea.

===Falkland Islands Patrol Task===

The Falkland Islands Patrol Task consists of a single warship (an Offshore Patrol Vessel) stationed around the EEZ of the Falkland Islands. It forms part of British Forces South Atlantic Islands and aims to reassure the inhabitants of the region and maintain British sovereignty.

 has been permanently assigned to the task since November 2019. &quot;Forth&quot; uses the deepwater naval base facilities of East Cove Military Port at Mare Harbour, East Falkland.

===Standing NATO Maritime Group 1===
The Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 is part of the wider NATO Response Force, its standard area of operations is the Atlantic Ocean. As of Feb 2023, the latest contribution to the task group was the Type 23 HMS &quot;Portland&quot;.

==British and Northern European Waters==

===Littoral Response Group (North)===
Littoral Response Group (North), is the lead formation, based in Europe, with an area of responsibility in the Atlantic, Baltic and Mediterranean. As of 2024, it includes a and a company of 45 Commando Royal Marines and supporting elements. While an is nominally assigned to LRG (North), both &quot;Albion&quot;-class vessels were in reserve as of 2024 with HMS Bulwark only to be activated &quot;if required&quot;. Then in late 2024, the newly elected Labour government indicated that the &quot;Albion&quot;-class ships would in fact be taken out of service, putting the entire Littoral Response Group concept into question. 

LRG (North) had been supported by other Royal Navy and allied assets, including the Royal Navy&#x27;s Carrier Strike Group, as required.

===Baltops===
Baltops is an annual 2-week exercise run by the US Navy. It is an exercise in which several NATO members come together to take part in a huge multinational exercise designed to strengthen the bonds of international partnership. The 2021 exercises included Royal Navy ships HMS &quot;Albion&quot; and RFA &quot;Mounts Bay&quot;.

===Cold Weather Training===

Cold Weather Training is a Royal Navy commitment to the annual Norwegian-led exercise in the Arctic regions. Its purpose is to build and strengthen military ties and to enable the Royal Marines and Royal Navy sailors to &quot;fight and win&quot; in extreme conditions.

===Faslane Patrol Boat Squadron===
The Faslane Patrol Boat Squadron (FPBS) provides force protection in around the waters of HMNB Clyde, where the Royal Navy&#x27;s nuclear-powered submarine fleet is based. The squadron currently consists of HMS &quot;Tracker&quot; and HMS &quot;Raider&quot;.

===Fishery Protection===
The Fishery Protection Squadron is charged with protecting the British fishing industry, providing security to the oil and gas fields in the North Sea and other duties in the United Kingdoms Exclusive economic zone. It consists of three warships: HMS &quot;Tyne&quot;, HMS &quot;Severn&quot; and HMS &quot;Mersey&quot;.

===Fleet Ready Escort===

The Fleet Ready Escort (FRE) is a single warship maintained at high readiness for deployment at short notice anywhere in the world. The FRE consists of either a guided-missile destroyer or a frigate. As of January 2014, this commitment has been &#x27;gapped&#x27; by the Royal Navy twice; for 19 days in 2011 and 18 days in 2012.

===Fleet Operational Sea Training===
Training in UK Home Waters is essential for preparing both crews and ships before overseas deployment. Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST) is responsible for making sure that both Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships are fit for operational purpose after rigorous exercises and readiness inspections. This commitment is ongoing 365 days a year.

===Joint Warrior===
Exercise Joint Warrior is a Royal Navy (and wider British Armed Forces) commitment to engage in a biannual tri-service exercise (including multinational NATO forces) intended to achieve enhanced military effect. It is the largest military exercise in Europe.

===Towed Array Patrol Ship===
Towed Array Patrol Ship (TAPS) is a standing task for reactive anti-submarine patrol duties in support of the Continuous At Sea Deterrent (Trident). A Type 23 frigate is maintained at high readiness for this task 365 days a year.

==East of Suez==
This is a list of operations and commitments presently undertaken by the Royal Navy East of Suez in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, the wider Indian Ocean and the Far East:

===Combined Task Force===
The Royal Navy regularly contributes to two multinational coalitions; Combined Task Force 150 and Combined Task Force 151. Combined Task Force 150 is focused on maritime security and counter-terrorism; while Combined Task Force 151 is charged with anti-piracy missions.

===Humanitarian Missions===
The Royal Navy remains committed to providing humanitarian aid where possible. During the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami the Royal Navy responded by deploying RFA &quot;Diligence&quot; and the frigate HMS &quot;Chatham&quot; with Westland Lynx helicopters to provide assistance. In 2014, the Royal Navy deployed HMS &quot;Echo&quot; (a multi-role hydrographic survey ship) and HMS &quot;Tireless&quot; (a nuclear-powered fleet submarine) to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in the Indian Ocean Region.

===Operation Kipion===
Operation Kipion is an ongoing maritime presence in the Gulf and Indian Ocean by the Royal Navy to protect and secure the nation&#x27;s many political and commercial interests. The enduring commitment usually consists of an escort (a guided-missile destroyer or frigate), a supporting Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship and several other ships with various roles. Operation Kipion was formerly known as the Armilla patrol during the 1980s and 1990s.

In a new initiative the frigate forward deployed to located at the Mina Salman Port in Bahrain in April 2019, remaining there until November 2022. She operated with a similar manning system to the Hunt and Sandown Class crew system, with two crews rotating every four months. This was achieved through the ship&#x27;s own crew being redesignated as the Port crew, while the crew of became the Starboard crew. In August 2022, departed Portsmouth en route to the Gulf to replace &quot;Montrose&quot; as the forward deployed Type 23 frigate and &quot;Montrose&quot; departed the Gulf to return to the U.K. in November 2022. It was expected that &quot;Lancaster&quot; would remain on station in the Gulf until 2025 using the same two crew manning system.

===Operation Kipion Mine Countermeasures===
The Royal Navy maintains a permanent presence in the Gulf consisting of mine countermeasure vessels. It provides continued support to the region ensuring the &quot;safe flow of trade and oil&quot;. Typically the mine countermeasure vessels are supported by a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship acting as a &#x27;mothership&#x27;.

As of January 2023 the following ships are assigned: RFA &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot;, HMS &quot;Chiddingfold&quot;, HMS &quot;Middleton&quot; and HMS &quot;Bangor&quot;.

===Littoral Response Group (South)===
Littoral Response Group (South), to deploy from late 2023, is to be based at the UK Joint Logistics Support Base in Duqm, Oman with responsibility for the Indo-Pacific. As of 2023, the principal vessels for LRG (South) were RFAs Argus and Lyme Bay. The LRG concept provides the UK options in an era of sub-threshold competition, a &quot;grey zone&quot; where nation states and actors compete in a hostile manner using tactics below the threshold of war. The newly elected Labour government&#x27;s decision to retire the &quot;Albion&quot;-class assault ships meant that, in future, only vessels from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary would be available to equip both Littoral Response Groups North and South. This put the viability of the concept into question.

===Indian Ocean/Pacific Offshore Patrol Vessels===
In September 2021, two Offshore Patrol Vessels, HMS Tamar and HMS Spey, sailed from the U.K. for a planned five to ten-year deployment in the Indian Ocean/Pacific region. The vessels were to be assigned missions ranging from &quot;security patrols to deal with drug-running, smuggling, terrorism and other illegal activities&quot; to &quot;joining in exercises with other navies and armed forces&quot;. Crews would be rotated to the ships on a regular basis and the ships were expected to operate from friendly ports as required, though the primary logistics hub is at the British Defence Singapore Support Unit in Singapore.

==Global==

===Continuous At Sea Deterrent===

The Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD; or, Trident) is provided by the Royal Navy&#x27;s four Vanguard-class submarines which deploy on a continuous basis around the globe. The Vanguard-class are each armed with a maximum of 16 Trident II D-5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and 48 nuclear warheads.

===International Partnerships===
The Royal Navy remains committed to working with its International Partners around the globe. The principal purpose of these partnerships is to reassure allied nations, to share intelligence and expertise, to build trust and ultimately provide security across the worlds oceans. Examples of such International Partnerships of which the Royal Navy plays a leading role include; the maritime component of the Anglo-French Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, AUSCANNZUKUS, the European Maritime Force and the Five Power Defence Arrangements. The United Kingdom is a member of RIMPAC also, although it hasn&#x27;t participated in way of deploying a surface ship in several years.

===Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime)===

Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime) (JEF(M)) -formerly the Response Force Task Group (RFTG) created under the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review- is the Royal Navy&#x27;s amphibious expeditionary task group maintained at high-readiness and available at short notice to respond to unexpected global events. In addition to amphibious operations, the JEF(M) can undertake a diverse range of activities such as evacuation operations, disaster relief or humanitarian aid. The composition of the JEF(M) generally consists of several large amphibious warfare ships (both RN and RFA) and replenishment ships from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

To demonstrate the operational readiness and global reach of the JEF(M), the Royal Navy deploys the amphibious task group on annual large scale international exercises, primarily in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. As an international deployment, the JEF(M) gets the chance to engage in &quot;intense&quot; exercises with foreign and allied navies, such as (for example) the Royal Navy of Oman.

The 2021 JEF (M) is centred on the Type 23&#x27;s HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; and HMS &quot;Westminster&quot; supported by where they are operating in the Baltic. HMS Lancaster is the flagship for the group. The group comprises Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian vessels supported by aircraft from Sweden. The group have recently been operating with SNMG1 within the baltic.

===NATO Mine Countermeasures===
This is the Royal Navy&#x27;s commitment to support NATO MCM operations in the Baltic, Northern European Waters, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea (though it is capable of deploying globally if needed). There are two organisational structures; Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1 and Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 2.

As of April 2022 the latest ship to be assigned was with Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1.

===UK Carrier Strike Group===

Since 2015, the Royal Navy has maintained a carrier strike group based around the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers with the aim to facilitate carrier-enabled power projection. It took to sea for the first time in October 2020 and its inaugural operational deployment is scheduled for 2021. CGS21 will demonstrate a fully sovereign UK carrier strike group comprising: , , , , , an attack submarine of the class, and a . Also accompanying will be a U.S. Navy destroyer .

==Mediterranean==

===Gibraltar Squadron===

The Gibraltar Squadron consists of two fast patrol boats: HMS &quot;Cutlass&quot; (P295) and HMS &quot;Dagger&quot; (P296). The squadron provides force protection for NATO or coalition warships entering the naval facilities of Gibraltar and conduct maritime security in the surrounding British territorial waters. The 2021 defence white paper indicated that henceforth, one River-class offshore patrol vessel, , would also be permanently based in Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Guinea.

===Standing NATO Maritime Group 2===
The Royal Navy routinely provides a single warship to the Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 (part of the NATO Response Force). The standard area of operations for the Standing NRF Maritime Group 2 is the Mediterranean Sea. In 2017, HMS &quot;Duncan&quot; deployed as flagship of the group, HM Ships &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Ocean&quot; also took on the role prior to &quot;Duncan&quot; resuming her duties in early 2018 till July 2018. The latest ship to be assigned was HMS &quot;Duncan&quot; in June 2023 as flagship.

===Special Purpose Task Group===
In April 2016, &quot;IHS Jane&#x27;s&quot; reported that the Royal Navy had formed a new marine task group, named the Special Purpose Task Group (SPTG), in December 2015. The task group is reportedly 150-strong and centred around Zulu Company of 45 Commando Royal Marines. It conducts counter-trafficking, counter-terrorism operations as well as providing support to United Kingdom Special Forces. The SPTG&#x27;s first operational deployment was in January 2016 to the Mediterranean on board . Additional personnel from 29 Regiment Royal Artillery, 17 Port and Maritime Regiment of the Royal Logistic Corps, 24 Engineer Regiment, and 30 (Information Exploitation) Commando Royal Marines were attached to provide specialist capabilities and expertise.

===Operation Sea Guardian===
Ships transiting or operating in the Mediterranean will routinely be assigned in Associated Support to Operation Sea Guardian. With the forward basing of HMS &quot;Trent&quot; to Gibraltar, she has been assigned to OSG in direct support. In 2020 and RFA &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; have also operated in support of the operation.

===Humanitarian missions===
The Royal Navy remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance in the Mediterranean. The most high profile of these missions in the area has been Operation Sophia. This was the EU led mission to counter illegal people trafficking from Libya. The Royal Navy&#x27;s contribution has been highly successful. During a 12 month deployment, provided the most days on task of any other unit and saved the most lives (9,100).

In 2020, HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was ordered to sail from Crete to use her hydrographic survey expertise to help to re-open the port of Beirut following the massive explosion which devastated the port and surrounding area. She also delivered humanitarian aid.

==Humanitarian missions==
When Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in late 2013, the Royal Navy deployed HMS &quot;Daring&quot; and HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; as part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s humanitarian aid mission to the region (known as Operation Patwin).

<doc id="682879" wikidata="Q1893045" url="?curid=682879" title="Vision Thing (album)">
<text>Vision Thing is the third studio album by English gothic rock band the Sisters of Mercy. It was released on 22 October 1990 through Merciful Release and East West Records, with Elektra Records handling the US release.

==Recording==
Soon after the release of the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Floodland&quot;, Eldritch approached guitarist John Perry to join them on writing a new album. After Perry turned down the offer to become a full-time member, the band began to search for a new guitarist through their record label. Eventually, Eldritch was forwarded a demo tape by young and unknown Andreas Bruhn. Bruhn was called to audition a week after turning in his tape.

As the band—now composed of Eldritch, Bruhn and bassist Patricia Morrison—was about to enter the studio, Morrison was abruptly replaced by the former Sigue Sigue Sputnik member Tony James. As Perry recalls, &quot;When I first heard the &quot;Vision Thing&quot; material, Patricia was there; when I did the album, she wasn&#x27;t.&quot; While details on Morrison parting ways with the band have never been fully disclosed, she herself was allegedly hired by Eldritch on the day her predecessor, Craig Adams, resigned.

Morrison later confirmed to have worked with Eldritch up until December 1989. She would go on to say her resignation was linked to her monthly salary of £300, and that she had her doubts on the band&#x27;s musical direction. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with the direction the record was going in. There were elements I didn&#x27;t like that could have gone either way, and now that Tony James is in I want nothing to do with it. It seems obvious what&#x27;s going on – it&#x27;s scam time...&quot;

While Morrison&#x27;s recording input on &quot;Floodland&quot; has been contested, Perry raised doubts whether either she or James play on &quot;Vision Thing&quot;. &quot;By the time of the recording, Tony James was in, but I&#x27;m not sure either [he or Patricia] actually played any bass on the record – sounds sequenced to me.&quot; James has later admitted his parts took some twenty minutes in total to record.

Ultimately, the band spent nine months in the Danish recording facilities, with guitarist Tim Bricheno recruited during the final two weeks. Then-manager Boyd Steemson followed suit at one point to observe the progress. &quot;I remember flying out to the [Puk] studio when they were making Vision Thing, and Tony [James] spoke to me and said: &#x27;Well, I guess it&#x27;s going to be a five-song album.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;No, it will not be a five-song album.&#x27; Two days later they had seven-and-a-half songs. It was a very painful process.&quot;

According to the official website of the band, the final mixes were not the ones worked on the most. &quot;&#x27;Vision Thing&#x27; is a stripped-down affair. Half of the finished mixes for the album are shelved in favour of rough mixes from earlier stages of the recording session, &#x27;monitor mixes&#x27; which retain the immediate feel of the songs.&quot;

==Content==
The album was designed by songwriter and singer Andrew Eldritch as an attack on the policies of the George H. W. Bush administration (the title comes from an oft-cited quote by Bush). According to Eldritch, the album&#x27;s artwork features a barely visible image of Detroit&#x27;s inner-city. The area had been heavily economically impacted during this period.

==Legacy==
Described by Andrew Eldritch as &quot;a fine album&quot;, it was included by &quot;Q&quot; magazine on their &quot;Fifty Best Albums of 1990&quot; list. In 1999, Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 69 on his list of &quot;The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs produced by Eldritch, except &quot;More&quot;, produced by Eldritch and Jim Steinman, and &quot;When You Don&#x27;t See Me&quot;, produced by Chris Tsangarides.

===2006 reissue===
Along with the group&#x27;s previous two releases, &quot;Vision Thing&quot; was reissued in November 2006 with bonus tracks.

==Personnel==
*Andrew Eldritch – vocals, guitars, keyboards
*Tim Bricheno – guitars
*Andreas Bruhn – guitars
*Tony James – bass
*Doktor Avalanche (drum machine) – drums

;Guest musicians
*John Perry – guitars, slide guitar on &quot;Detonation Boulevard&quot;

<text>Robert William Thomson PRSSA FRSE (29 June 1822 – 8 March 1873) was a Scottish inventor known for inventing the refillable fountain pen and the pneumatic tyre.

==Life==

He was born on 29 June 1822 in Stonehaven in the northeast of Scotland, He was baptised into the Church of Scotland on 26 July 1822. Robert was the eleventh of twelve children of a local woolen mill owner. His family wished him to study for the ministry, but Robert refused, one reason being his inability to master Latin. Robert left school es, where he was apprenticed to a merchant. Two years later he returned home and taught himself chemistry, electricity and astronomy with the help of a local weaver who had knowledge of mathematics.

Robert&#x27;s father gave him a workshop, and by the time he was 17 years old he had rebuilt his mother&#x27;s washing mangle so that the wet linen could be passed through the rollers in either direction, and had completed the first working model of his elliptic rotary steam engine which he perfected in later life. He served an engineering apprenticeship in Aberdeen and Dundee before joining a civil engineering company in Glasgow. He then went to work for an Edinburgh firm of civil engineers where he devised a new method of detonating explosive charges by the use of electricity, thus greatly reducing the loss of lives in mines throughout the world.

Thomson next worked as a railway engineer and supervised the blasting of chalk cliffs near Dover for the South Eastern Railway. Soon he set up his own railway consultancy business and proposed the line for the Eastern Counties Railway which was accepted by Parliament and eventually developed.

Thomson was 23 years old when he patented his pneumatic tyre. He was granted a patent in France in 1846 and in the US in 1847. His tyre consisted of a hollow belt of India-rubber inflated with air so that the wheels presented &quot;a cushion of air to the ground, rail or track on which they run&quot;. This elastic belt of rubberized canvas was enclosed within a strong outer casing of leather which was bolted to the wheel. Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Aerial Wheels&quot; were demonstrated in London&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park in March 1847 and were fitted to several horse-drawn carriages, greatly improving the comfort of travel and reducing noise. One set ran for 1200 miles without a sign of deterioration.

In 1849 he invented the refillable fountain pen.

In 1863 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being Charles Piazzi Smyth. From 1869 to 1871 he served as president of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts.

He amassed a large sum from his inventions and lived in a huge townhouse at 3 Moray Place on the Moray Estate in west Edinburgh.

He died at home in Edinburgh on 8 March 1873 aged 50. He was buried in Dean Cemetery in west Edinburgh on the path leading from the centre of the cemetery to the south-west.

==Family==

Thomson married Clara Hertz (daughter of a diamond merchant) on the island of Java. They had two sons and two daughters including Courtauld Thomson and Elspeth, wife of Wind in the Willows author Kenneth Grahame. His wife survived him and remarried in 1875 to John Fletcher Moulton (later Lord Moulton) and died in 1888.

<text>Robert Ernest Andrews (born August 4, 1957) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative for from 1990 to 2014. The district included most of Camden County and parts of Burlington County and Gloucester County. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

== Early life, education, and early career ==
Andrews was born in Camden, New Jersey, the son of Josephine (née Amies) and Ernest Andrews; he is predominantly of Scottish and Scotch-Irish descent and counts American portrait painter Charles Willson Peale and Johannes Roosevelt among his ancestors. He grew up in Bellmawr and attended Triton Regional High School in Runnemede. Andrews was the first in his family to attend college, graduating from Bucknell University in 1979 with a BA in political science, summa cum laude. He later attended Cornell University Law School, earning his JD degree with honors in 1982. Before his election to Congress, Andrews was involved in legal education as a member of &quot;Cornell Law Review&quot;‍‍ &#x27;‍s board of editors.

He worked as an attorney and an adjunct professor at the Rutgers School of Law–Camden. Starting in 1983, Andrews operated a private legal practice. In 1986, he was elected as a member of the Camden County Board of Chosen Freeholders, where he served for four years, including two years as freeholder director (1988–1990).

==U.S. House of Representatives==
First elected to Congress in 1990, Andrews served for 24 years as the U.S. representative for New Jersey&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which includes most of Camden County and parts of Burlington County and Gloucester County. In the U.S. House of Representatives, he served on the Committee on Armed Services, Committee on the Budget, and Committee on Education and Labor, where he served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions.

===Elections===
In 1990, after 15-year incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman James Florio resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives to take office as Governor of New Jersey, Andrews won the 1990 special election and simultaneous general election against Gloucester County Freeholder Daniel J. Mangini. He subsequently won re-election every two years until his retirement. Andrews had the 10th longest tenure among U.S. Representatives in New Jersey history, and the fifth longest among Democrats in the state. In November 2004, he received more votes than anyone ever elected to the U.S. House from New Jersey, a record which he broke again in 2008 and 2012.

* Co-Chairman of the Steering and Policy Committee

===Tenure===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized Congressman Andrews as &quot;fiscally conservative but socially moderate.&quot; He has a lifetime rating of 17.24 from the American Conservative Union and a 2007 rating of 100 from Americans for Democratic Action. He has a liberal rating of 76.2 and a conservative rating of 23.8 from the &quot;National Journal&quot;.

According to President Barack Obama, he was an original author of the Affordable Care Act that was designed to cut the costs for American taxpayers on healthcare.

=== Alleged misuse of campaign funds ===

On December 2, 2008, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint against Andrews and four other politicians to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for allegedly violating the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). In the complaint, CREW stated that Andrews&#x27;s campaign committee spent $952.04 of campaign funds on clothing, which FECA classified as personal spending. A spokesman for Andrews responded that the clothing was intended to replace lost luggage from a flight, and that Andrews deposited $952.04 into his campaign account after the airline reimbursed him. The FEC dismissed the complaint on July 16, 2009, but affirmed in the dismissal that the purchases violated campaign finance laws.

&quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; reported on November 20, 2011 that Andrews financed a family vacation to Edinburgh, Scotland and other European destinations with over $9,000 of campaign funds. The report claimed that Andrews &quot;mixed personal and political expenses in an unorthodox way&quot; on multiple occasions. These expenses included a $10,000 house party celebrating both his career anniversary and his daughter&#x27;s graduation, a $12,500 donation to the Walnut Street Theatre – where his daughter performed, and trips to California that overlapped with his daughter&#x27;s auditions. Andrews and his chief of staff replied that the vacation involved attending an adviser&#x27;s wedding, the party was primarily for &quot;political associates&quot;, the theatre donation was in support of its outreach program, and his daughter assisted him with fundraising during their trips.

CREW filed another compliant with the FEC on November 30, 2011 based on &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;″s article. Andrews described the complaint as &quot;baseless&quot; and stated, &quot;The campaign has fully complied with all laws with respect to the proper expenditure and disclosure of campaign funds. All personal aspects of any expenditures or activities have always been paid in full from our family’s personal funds.&quot; The Associated Press elaborated on March 28, 2012 that Andrews&#x27;s 18 trips to California from 2007 to 2012 resulted in over $97,000 of campaign expenses and $260,000 of donations, short of the 3:1 ratio of donations to expenses that is expected from political fundraising trips.

The United States House Committee on Ethics started researching the complaint on July 17, 2012, and decided on August 31 that it would proceed with an investigation. On March 19, 2013, the Committee declared that a special panel would examine whether Andrews&#x27;s travel expenses from the Edinburgh and California trips complied with campaign finance laws. Andrews resigned from Congress on February 4, 2014. He said that the campaign finance probe had &quot;no role at all&quot; in his resignation, and that he was departing for a position at the Dilworth Paxson law firm. The FEC dismissed the complaint on June 3, 2014 with &quot;prosecutorial discretion&quot;, noting that Andrews reimbursed his campaign for the Edinburgh trip before he received the complaint, and that any violations in the California trips were &quot;relatively small&quot;.

In February 2014, Andrews resigned from his position in the middle of his term, while being investigated by the United States House Committee on Ethics for alleged violations related to his use of campaign funds for personal expenses. Andrews stated it was to take a job with a law firm in Philadelphia. The complaint was dismissed in June 2014.

==Other political activities==
In 1997, Andrews ran for Governor of New Jersey. In the Democratic primary, he was defeated 40%–37%, a margin of 9,993 votes, by State Senator Jim McGreevey.
Andrews was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 U.S. Senate election. Andrews lost to incumbent Frank Lautenberg, but subsequently won re-election to his House seat, with Andrews &quot;[receiving] more votes in November 2008 than anyone ever elected to the U.S. House in New Jersey, breaking his own record.&quot;

==Personal life==
Andrews is married and has two daughters. He is an Episcopalian.

<text>The ISCARS Dash Touring Series (previously known as the NASCAR Baby Grand National, Goody&#x27;s Dash Series and IPOWER Dash Series among others) was a stock car racing series created by NASCAR in 1973, initially running solely at North Wilkesboro Speedway, that involved V6 powered stock cars raced over relatively short distances. In 1975 the series branched out to other tracks besides North Wilkesboro Speedway. After the end of the 2003 season, NASCAR transferred the Goody&#x27;s Dash series to IPOWER (International Participants Of Winning Edge Racing). In 2004, they ran the IPOWER Dash Series. In January 2005, officials announced the cancellation of the 2005 Dash season due to problems with sponsorship. The International Sport Compact Auto Racing Series (ISCARS) purchased the series allowing the series to continue through 2005 and was operating until 2011.

==History==
===NASCAR sanctioning===
The unofficial start of the series was in 1973 in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. A group of drivers began racing on a road course owned by former NASCAR Cup owner Bill Ellis. Ellis decided not to continue after a few races. The drivers decided to format an association called the Baby Grand National Racing Association, Inc. (BGNRA), and appointed Charlie Triplett as president. Triplett says the name stemmed from the cars&#x27; resemblance to the Grand National (predecessor to the modern NASCAR Cup Series) cars of the era, as paint schemes and numbers often matched those from Grand National cars. The series was originally a touring series of four-cylinder compact sedan cars. The slogan for the series was &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Way to Race.&quot; The founder turned to NASCAR to begin sanctioning the series in 1975. The series flourished with the relatively inexpensive cars and motors. It was not uncommon for forty drivers to enter an event.

Five-time champion Dean Combs used a Datsun 200SX in the 1980 season and became the first NASCAR driver to &#x27;regularly&#x27; compete in a foreign-made car. Contrary to popular belief, foreign cars had competed in NASCAR competition in the early days of the sanctioning body; indeed, a Jaguar won a NASCAR-sanctioned race in the Grand National division at a road course in Linden, New Jersey in 1954, according to commentator Mike Joy, and the last foreign-made car to compete in a NASCAR-sanctioned event was an MG at one Grand National race in 1963 (before Toyota, who had used the Dash Series to prepare their stock car endeavors as demonstrated by Robert Huffman&#x27;s championship victory in 2003, entered the Truck Series in 2004 and later Cup Series at the beginning of the 2007 season).

During the series&#x27; existence, the series became a place for young drivers to gain valuable experience competing against seasoned veterans like Danny Bagwell, Geoff Bodine, Johnny Chapman, Jake, and Justin Hobgood, all of which have experience at the top levels of NASCAR. 1986 Daytona 500 Champion Geoffrey Bodine joined the circuit in 2008 to compete in the final four events; ISCARS later used the run to highlight Bodine&#x27;s involvement as part of an extensive driver development program. Bagwell is well known for a destructive accident in 1999 at Daytona when the vehicle hit the wall and tumbled repeatedly. It ended up upside down, the engine was gone, all the wheels were out, the windshield, and the sheet metal disintegrated, leaving only a pile of bent safety bars. Also in this series was the only car ever to careen into Lake Lloyd, Dave Stacey in 1994. The series was not free from fatal accidents during NASCAR&#x27;s sanctioning: Joe Young and Joe Booher died in Daytona Dash Series races in 1987 and 1993, respectively.

NASCAR significantly changed the dynamics of the series in the early 1980s. NASCAR mandated using the Iron Duke motor (manufactured by Pontiac), changing the cost for a motor from approximately $800 to $22,000. Pontiac provided motors to five or six teams. The much greater expense led to only ten to twelve teams competing in events. NASCAR changed from a four-cylinder to a V6 motor in 1998, but still allowed teams to use either four or six cylinder engines from that point on. Most teams elected to use the V6 engines. NASCAR&#x27;s sanctioning for the series ended in 2003, when they transferred the sanctioning to IPOWER (International Participants Of Winning Edge Racing).

===Death of Roy Weaver and demise===
On February 8, 2004, the first IPOWER Dash race ended in tragedy when Roy Weaver, a safety worker at Daytona International Speedway, was killed when he was struck by a car driven by Ray Paprota. Weaver was attempting to pick up debris from a racing accident at the time. Although inconsequential to the incident, it is noteworthy that Ray Paprota is a paraplegic and was driving with hand controls. For the rest of Speedweeks, flags at Daytona flew at half-staff in Weaver&#x27;s memory.

In 2005, Weaver&#x27;s widow and three children competed on &quot;The Amazing Race: Family Edition&quot;, a reality television competition show on CBS. Two of the challenges were directly related to racing. The family finished in third place, and were largely negatively viewed in the season.

After Weaver&#x27;s fatal accident, the Dash Series would not appear on TV and failed to find sponsorship. After the 2005 season was initially canceled, former Dash Series Chaplain and NASCAR Media Coordinator, Randy Claypoole, revived the series under the name International Sport Compact Auto Racing Series (ISCARS). The series held over 100 events, from 2005, until its final race at Hickory Motor Speedway in October 2011. In the series&#x27; final years, the cars featured a rear wing, but different from those used on the fifth-generation Car of Tomorrow used in the Cup Series between 2007 and mid-2010.

<doc id="682904" wikidata="Q5504163" url="?curid=682904" title="Friends Committee on National Legislation">
<text>The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) is a national nonprofit, nonpartisan Quaker organization. As a 501(c)(4) advocacy organization, FCNL and its network lobby Congress and the administration to promote peace, justice, and environmental stewardship. It was founded in 1943 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).

FCNL leads coalitions, such as the Prevention and Protection Working Group, and working groups affiliated with the Washington Interfaith Staff Coalition.

== Quaker lobbying ==
FCNL&#x27;s approach to lobbying is grounded in Quaker faith and practice. In the mid-seventeenth century, Friends were activists out of necessity. Their refusal to obey laws that they believed were not of God led to imprisonment, confiscation of goods, and execution. A hallmark of Quaker interaction with government is the use of persuasion rather than coercion and violence.

FCNL fields one of the largest faith-based lobbies in Washington, D.C. Its work is supported by a grassroots network of thousands of advocates all over the country. In 42 states and the District of Columbia, many of the grassroots advocates have formed themselves into Advocacy Teams. As of 2021, there were more than 120 such teams, involving more than 1,500 grassroots advocates. Advocates visit the offices of members of Congress and write letters or speak through local media to catalyze federal change.

FCNL was the 2024 recipient of The US Peace Prize &quot;For Efforts Over 81 Years to Educate, Build Coalitions &amp; Influence Congress to Stop Funding War &amp; Nuclear Weapons.&quot;

==Legislative policy approach==
FCNL&#x27;s approach draws on the expertise of registered lobbyists in Washington, D.C., the work of advocates around the country and relationships cultivated with elected officials and community leaders. The business practice of the Religious Society of Friends is one that seeks for participants to come to unity. FCNL&#x27;s General Committee follows this practice in determining legislative policy and priorities, a discernment process they undertake every two years or for every new session of Congress.

=== Policy positions during the 117th Congress (2021–2023) ===

* Promote Peacebuilding by emphasizing diplomacy and honoring treaties and by working towards peaceful prevention and resolution of violent conflict, especially in the Middle East. 
* Confront the paradigm of global militarism, demilitarize space, reduce military spending, limit the spread of conventional weapons, prevent armed interventions, repeal the Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs), and reassert Congress&#x27; oversight role.
* Promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
* Advocate for a just and equitable justice system that eliminates mass incarceration and police brutality, and establishes law-enforcement that is community-oriented and demilitarized.
* Ensure that the U.S. immigration system promotes and respects the rights, safety, humanity, and dignity of all immigrants, refugees, and migrants.
* Promote equitable access for all citizens to participation in an open and transparent political process, protect the integrity of our democratic institutions and processes, and work to ensure honesty and accountability of elected and appointed officials.
* End gun violence by supporting policies that are informed by public health best practices.
* Witness and advocate for American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian rights and concerns. Honor the treaties and promises.
* Address structural economic inequality through measures such as a fair and progressive tax system, a living wage for all, and an adequate social safety net.
* Prioritize programs that meet basic needs including universal access to quality affordable healthcare, a necessity magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Strengthen environmental protections and advance environmental justice, while recognizing the finite capacity of the earth and the need to protect human, animal and plant diversity.
* Advance sustainable, science-based solutions to the climate crisis and prioritize international cooperation to achieve global sustainability goals and protect vulnerable populations.

== History and impact ==

During the discussions in the US in 1940 regarding World War II, Quakers opposed the war as a matter of conscience. Friends from 22 Yearly Meetings came to Richmond, Indiana, a city that has historically embraced Quaker values, for a conference to address the national draft. This conference set the stage for a subsequent gathering of 52 Quakers in Richmond from June 11–12, 1943. That gathering gave birth to the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) to influence U.S. government decisions related to war and peace.

FCNL&#x27;s advocacy in solidarity with Native Americans and Alaska Natives dates back to 1956 when the government finalized its plans to prevent flooding in Pittsburgh by building the Kinzua Dam to divert the Allegheny River. The Seneca Nation lost 10,000 acres of its Allegany Territory.

The organization&#x27;s subsequent work with Native Americans was based largely on a series of consultations by a group equally made up of tribal and yearly meeting representatives. These consultations led to opposition to the U.S. government&#x27;s termination policy that ended federal recognition of many tribes as government entities. It catalyzed grassroots support for adequate funding for schools and healthcare (e.g., the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (P.L. 94-437) to improve the Indian Health Service), for the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (P.L. 92-203), and for oil rights for the Osage Nation. In 2017, FCNL started a Native American Advocacy Program led by a young Native American. Its focus has largely been on the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.

FCNL&#x27;s first 30 years were also marked by efforts to stop violent conflict around the world and address root causes. Its legislative policy is rooted in the belief that there is that of God in every person. This belief has fueled the Quakers&#x27; longstanding Peace Testimony—promoting peace and refraining from violence and actively opposing war. Peace testimony has governed FCNL&#x27;s work to prevent war, minimize the threat of war, and promote peace since its beginning.

From providing relief to Europe during and after World War II, defeating congressional proposals for mandatory military training for young men, and opposing civil defense measures to playing a significant role in the creation of the Peace Corps in 1961, FCNL has remained steadfast in its commitment to the peace testimony, manifested by ending and preventing war.

FCNL has opposed nuclear weapons since their creation. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, FCNL called for United Nations negotiations rather than military intervention to mitigate the possibility of tensions escalating to war. FCNL&#x27;s advocacy was key to the establishment of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1968, which went into effect in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, FCNL was an active opponent of the Vietnam War. Disillusioned and frustrated with the war, young Quakers urged FCNL to establish an internship program in 1970 as an alternate form of public service. Since its inception, hundreds of recent graduates have spent 11 months at FCNL learning to advocate, developing leadership skills, and enriching Quaker lobbying.

In 1974, Edward Snyder (FCNL&#x27;s Executive Secretary from 1962 to 1990) led efforts to cancel the appropriation of $474 million to the South Vietnamese military, expediting an end to the U.S. war in Vietnam.

In the 1970s, FCNL was an early advocate for sustainable development and reducing harmful impacts on the environment. During that decade, FCNL accelerated its focus on human rights and continued advocating for peace. The organization also became vocal on energy and nuclear power, emphasizing conservation, renewable energy resources, and a moratorium on construction of new nuclear power plants. These efforts would continue throughout the 1980s, as FCNL also increased its advocacy for economic justice.

In the 1980s, FCNL lobbied the U.S. government in the lead-up to the 1986 Reykjavik Summit. The summit between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev signaled the thawing of U.S.-Soviet relations and ended the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations between the two countries. The 1986 Reykjavik Summit paved the way for the 1987 INF Treaty and the 1991 START I Treaties, as well as limitations on nuclear testing.

During the 1980s, the World Bank turned to FCNL as an organization at the forefront of addressing the inextricable links between the environment and global poverty. That same decade, FCNL&#x27;s Ruth Flower also chaired the Domestic Human Needs Working Group of Interfaith Action for Economic Justice, central in the welfare reform debate in Congress. FCNL also led other faith groups in advocating for more generous and less punitive legislation.

By the 1990s, FCNL&#x27;s influence and capacity to change public policy increased. It worked to shift budget priorities away from military spending to support international organizations and diplomacy, reform the U.S. healthcare system, advocate for Native American rights, curtail the global weapons trade, and respond to national and international crises.

In 1992, FCNL was instrumental in helping to ratify the U.N. Convention on Chemical Weapons. This U.N. arms control treaty outlaws the production and use of chemical weapons and leads to the destruction of 93% of the world&#x27;s declared stockpile of chemical weapons. Since 1993, FCNL has also led the coalition of NGOs and advocacy groups working to develop a strict set of arms export criteria that would prevent nations from providing military assistance or exporting weapons to countries engaged in abusive practices.

The day after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, FCNL issued a statement discouraging the U.S. government from responding with violence. The &quot;War is not the Answer&quot; slogan would shape FCNL&#x27;s legislative policy throughout the decade. Two days after that, Congress turned over to the president its constitutional power to decide whether and when the U.S. enters military conflict. Since then, lawmakers have twice invoked the War Powers Act of 1973, which was intended to check the president&#x27;s power to commit the United States to an armed conflict without congressional consent.

The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)—the law behind the &quot;War on Terror&quot;—has given four administrations expansive and endless war-making powers. The 2002 AUMF served as the ultimate basis for U.S. military action against the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq. FCNL lobbyists continues to advocate for resolutions to &quot;cancel the blank check for war&quot; by restoring Congress&#x27; power to determine whether and when the U.S. goes to war.

For more than ten years, FCNL has encouraged a shift from violent, reactionary responses to peaceful conflict resolution and diplomacy. It also advocated for reductions and alternatives to increased military spending, urged Congress to put an end to the war in Yemen, and successfully lobbied for the prevention of atrocities and genocide. FCNL was key to the passage of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act (P.L. 115–441), which passed in 2018 and became law in 2019. The bill ensures coordination among U.S. government departments to prevent global atrocities from occurring and mandates training for American diplomats to identify early warning signs of genocide.

FCNL lobbied for the Iran nuclear deal, including the 2015 Join Comprehensive Plan of Action.

After several years of FCNL&#x27;s lobbying for legislation to demilitarize police, President Obama announced in 2015 that the federal government will no longer provide certain military equipment to local police forces.

In December 2018, President Trump signed the First Step Act (P.L. 115- 391) into law, reducing sentences for non-violent crimes and improving rehabilitation for those in prison. In February 2019, the House of Representatives passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act; FCNL had coordinated lobbying of more than 50 faith groups to ensure the bill&#x27;s passage. Two months later, the House voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, including FCNL-backed provisions to strengthen protection for Native women and children.  

Throughout its history, FCNL has also lobbied on federal appropriations, making sure new laws are properly funded. It is also vocal in opposing the superfluous funding of laws that conflict with organization&#x27;s mission at the expense of equity, justice, peace, or the environment.

=== Brick and mortar ===
In 2005, FCNL made good on its commitment to restore and transform its historic Capitol Hill office, becoming the first LEED-certified building on Capitol Hill. In 2020, the U.S. Green Building Council upgraded the FCNL&#x27;s rating from silver to platinum, its highest level.

In 2011, FCNL purchased the adjoining row house, on 205 C Street. The organization renovated it using the same green principles used in FCNL&#x27;s main building. It was re-opened in 2017.

In 2019, the FCNL Education Fund assumed management and governance of the William Penn House. In 2020, it was renamed the Friends Place on Capitol Hill. In renaming it, the board was mindful that William Penn enslaved people. The building, finished in 1917, was purchased by the Friends Meeting in Washington in 1966 to advance Quaker efforts on Capitol Hill. Shortly after acquiring it, the FCNL Education Fund undertook major repairs to modernize Friends Place. Today, it is a guesthouse and learning center.

== Organization ==

=== Governance and funding ===
FCNL is governed by a General Committee of approximately 180 Friends, the majority of whom have been appointed by 26 Yearly Meetings and 7 national Friends&#x27; organizations. The General Committee meets to conduct business at the organization&#x27;s Annual Meeting. Seven standing committees oversee the program and administration of FCNL between Annual Meetings.

The majority of FCNL&#x27;s budget comes from individual donations. FCNL is also supported by contributions from Quaker meetings and churches (including Yearly Meetings and Quarterly Meetings), foundations, bequests, and endowments.

=== Leadership and staff ===
Starting January 24, 2022, Bridget Moix assumed her role as FCNL&#x27;s fifth general secretary, assisted by five associate general secretaries. The five associate general secretaries are Adlai Amor for communications, Lauren Brownlee for community and culture, Stephen Donahoe for development, Amelia Kegan for policy and advocacy, and Thomas Swindell for finance and operations.

Moix is preceded by Diane Randall, FCNL&#x27;s first female general secretary, who served for ten years (2011–2021). Previous FCNL chief executives are: E. Raymond Wilson (1943–1962), Ed Snyder (1962–1990), and Joe Volk (1990–2011).

There are more than 60 full-time staff and consultants working at FCNL.

<text>Occitan literature (referred to in older texts as Provençal literature) is a body of texts written in Occitan, mostly in the south of France. It was the first literature written in a Romance language and inspired the rise of vernacular literature throughout medieval Europe. Occitan literature&#x27;s Golden Age was in the 12th century, when a rich and complex body of lyrical poetry was produced by troubadours writing in Old Occitan, which still survives to this day. Although Catalan is considered by some a variety of Occitan, this article will not deal with Catalan literature, which started diverging from its Southern French counterpart in the late 13th century.

==Introduction==
Occitan literature started in the 11th century in several centres. It gradually spread first over the greater portion (though not the whole) of southern France, into what is now the north of Italy and into Spain (Catalonia, Galicia, Castile), and Portugal.

In its rise, Occitan literature stands completely by itself, and in its development, it long continued to be highly original. It presents at several points, analogies with French literature; but these analogies are due principally to certain primary elements common to both and only in a slight degree to mutual reaction.

==Origin==

Occitan poetry first appeared in the 11th century. The oldest surviving text is the Provençal burden (Fr. &quot;refrain&quot;) attached to a 10th-century Latin poem. The text has not yet been satisfactorily interpreted. The quality of the earliest remaining works suggest earlier work was lost.
The earliest Occitan poem is a 10th-century, seventeen-line charm &quot;Tomida femina&quot; probably for dispersing the pain of childbirth. Much longer is an 11th-century fragment of two hundred and fifty-seven decasyllabic verses preserved in an Orléans manuscript, first printed by Raynouard. The linguistic features of the poem suggest it originated in Limousin or Marche in the north of the Occitan region. The unknown author takes Boethius&#x27;s treatise as the groundwork of his composition. The poem is a didactic piece composed by a clerk. The &quot;Cançó de Santa Fe&quot; dates from 1054–1076, but probably represents a Catalan dialect that evolved into a distinct language from Occitan. From the same century there is &quot;Las, qu&#x27;i non sun sparvir, astur&quot;, a secular love poem.

From the close of the same century are the poems of William (Guilhem) IX, the grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine. They consist of eleven diverse strophic pieces, and were consequently meant to be sung. Several are love songs. The only one which can be approximately dated was composed around 1119, when William was setting out for Spain to fight the Saracens. It expresses the writer&#x27;s regret for the frivolity of his past life and his apprehensions as he bade farewell to his country and his young son. We also know from Ordericus Vitalis that William had composed various poems on the incidents of his ill-fated Crusade of 1101. In one of his pieces &quot;Ben voil que sapchon ii plusor&quot; he makes an allusion to the partimen. 

The origins of this poetry are uncertain. It bears no relation to Latin poetry, nor to folklore. Vernacular compositions seem to have been at first produced for the amusement, or in the case of religious poetry, for the edification, of that part of lay society which had leisure and lands, and reckoned intellectual pastime among the good things of life. 

In the 11th century, vernacular poetry served mainly the amusement and edification of the upper class. By the 12th and 13th centuries, historical works and popular treatises on contemporary science were composed in the vernacular. 

Occitan poetry may have originated amongst the jesters. Some, leaving buffoonery to the ruder and less intelligent members of the profession, devoted themselves to the composition of pieces intended for singing. In the north, the jesters produced &quot;chansons de geste&quot; full of tales of battle and combat. In the courts of the southern nobles they produced love songs.

==Age of the troubadours==
Starting in the early 12th century, the best-known body of Occitan literature originated with the group of poets who would later become known as troubadours, from the verb &quot;trobar&quot;, meaning &quot;to invent&quot;. The troubadours used a standardized form of Old Occitan (one probably based on the dialect of Limoges), sang their pieces to music and generally used complex and elaborate meters. Their poetry was usually lyrical, with a minority of pieces of satirical, political, moralistic, religious or erotic nature.

===Early period===
The first known troubadour was William IX, Duke of Aquitaine whose works gave the movement a position of honor, and indirectly contributed in a very powerful degree to ensure its development and preservation.

Shortly after him, centres of poetic activity made their appearance in various places, first in Limousin and Gascony. In the former province lived &quot;Ebolus cantator&quot; (a singer named Eble), who during the second part of William of Poitiers&#x27; life seems to have been brought into relation with him, and according to a contemporary historian, Geoffroy, prior of Vigeois, &quot;erat valde gratiosus in cantilenis&quot; (&quot;gave a great deal of pleasure by his songs&quot;). None of his compositions survive; but under his influence Bernart of Ventadour was trained to poetry, who, though only the son of one of the serving-men of the castle, managed to gain the love of the lady of Ventadour, and when on the discovery of their amour he had to depart elsewhere, received a gracious welcome from Eleanor of Aquitaine, consort (from 1152) of Henry II of England. Of Bernart&#x27;s compositions we possess about fifty songs of elegant simplicity, some of which may be taken as the most perfect specimens of love poetry Occitan literature has ever produced. Bernart must therefore have been in repute before the middle of the 12th century; and his poetic career extended well on towards its close.

At the same period, or probably a little earlier, flourished Cercamon, of genuine importance among the troubadours both because of his early date and because definite information regarding him has been preserved. He was a Gascon, and composed, says his old biographer, pastorals according to the ancient custom (&quot;pastorelas a la uzansa antiga&quot;). This is the record of the appearance in the south of France of a poetic form which ultimately acquired large development. The period at which Cercamon lived is determined by a piece where he alludes very clearly to the approaching marriage of the king of France, Louis VII, with Eleanor of Aquitaine (1137). Among the earliest troubadours may also be reckoned Marcabru, a pupil of Cercamon, from whose pen we have about forty pieces, those which can be approximately dated ranging from 1135 to 1148 or thereabout. This poet has great originality of thought and style. His songs, several of which are historical, are free from the commonplaces of their class, and contain curious strictures on the corruptions of the time.

===Golden age: trobar leu, troubar clus, and trobar ric===
This article cannot do more than enumerate the leading troubadours and briefly indicate in what conditions their poetry was developed and through what circumstances it fell into decay and finally disappeared: Peire d&#x27;Alvernha, who in certain respects must be classed with Marcabru; Arnaut Daniel, remarkable for his complicated versification, the inventor of the sestina, a poetic form for which Dante and Petrarch express an admiration difficult for us to understand; Arnaut de Mareuil; Bertran de Born, now the most generally known of all the troubadours on account of the part he is said to have played both by his sword and his sirveniescs in the struggle between Henry II of England and his rebel sons, though the importance of his part in the events of the time seems to have been greatly exaggerated; Peire Vidal of Toulouse, a poet of varied inspiration who grew rich with gifts bestowed on him by the greatest nobles of his time; Guiraut de Borneil, &quot;lo macsire dels trobadors&quot;, and at any rate master in the art of the so-called close style (&quot;trebar clus&quot;), though he has also left us some songs of charming simplicity; Gaucelm Faidit, from whom we have a touching lament (&quot;plaint&quot;) on the death of Richard Cœur de Lion; Folquet of Marseille, the most powerful thinker among the poets of the south, who from being a merchant and troubadour became an abbot, and finally bishop of Toulouse (died 1231).

===Later troubadours, and foreign ones===
As the troubadours started scattering from Southern France after the Albigensian crusade, the quality of their poetry decayed sharply: Dante, in his De vulgari eloquentia mentions only authors of the previous generation (Peire d&#x27;Alvernha, Giraut de Bornelh, Bertran de Born and Arnaut Daniel) as models of vernacular literature. However, the presence of troubadours in foreign courts engendered a number of imitators in Catalonia (for example Cerverì de Girona) and Italy (Sordello, Lanfranc Cigala, Rambertino Buvalelli).

===Troubadours and society===
It is not without interest to discover to what social classes the troubadours belonged. Many of them, there is no doubt, had a very humble origin. Bernart of Ventadour&#x27;s father was a servant, Peire Vidal&#x27;s a maker of furred garments, Perdigon&#x27;s a fisher. Others belonged to the bourgeoisie, Peire d&#x27;Alvernha, for example, Peire Raimon of Toulouse, and Elias Fonsalada. Likewise we see merchants&#x27; sons as troubadours; this was the case with Folquet of Marseille and Aimeric de Peguilhan. A great many were clerics, or at least studied for the Church, for instance, Arnaut de Mareuil, Uc de Saint Circ, Aimeric de Belenoi, Hugh Brunet, Peire Cardenal; some had even taken orders: the monk of Montaudon and Gaubert de Puicibot. Ecclesiastical authority did not always tolerate this breach of discipline. Gui d&#x27;Ussel, canon and troubadour, was obliged by the injunction of the pontifical legate to give up his song-making; Folquet, too, renounced it when he took orders. One point is particularly striking, the number of monarchs and nobles who were troubadours: Raimon de Miraval, Pons de Capdoill, Guilhem Ademar, Cadenet, Peirol, Raimbaut de Vacqueiras, and many more. Some of this group were poor knights whose incomes were insufficient to support their rank, and took up poetry not merely for their own pleasure, but for the sake of the gifts to be obtained from the rich whose courts they frequented. A very different position was occupied by such wealthy and powerful people as William of Poitiers, Raimbaut d&#x27;Aurenga, the viscount of Saint Antonin, Guillem de Berguedà and Blacatz.

The profession was entirely dependent on the existence and prosperity of the feudal courts. The troubadours could hardly expect to obtain a livelihood from any other quarter than the generosity of the great. It will consequently be well to mention the more important at least of those princes who are known to have been patrons and some of them practisers of the poetic art. They are arranged approximately in geographical order, and after each are inserted the names of those troubadours with whom they were connected.

===Patronage===
While the troubadours found protectors in Catalonia, Castile and Italy, they do not seem to have been welcomed in French-speaking countries. This, however, must not be taken too absolutely. Occitan poetry was appreciated in the north of France. There is reason to believe that when Constance, daughter of one of the counts of Arles, was married in 1001 to Robert, king of France, she brought along with her Provençal jongleurs. Poems by troubadours are quoted in the French romances of the beginning of the 13th century; some of them are transcribed in the old collections of French songs, and the preacher Robert de Sorbon informs us in a curious passage that one day a jongleur sang a poem by Folquet of Marseilles at the court of the king of France. Since the countries of the langue d&#x27;oil had a full developed literature of their own, the troubadours generally preferred to go to regions where they had less competition.

The decline and fall of troubadour poetry was mainly due to political causes. When about the beginning of the 13th century the Albigensian Crusade led by the French king had decimated and ruined the nobility and reduced to lasting poverty a part of the Occitan territories, the profession of troubadour ceased to be lucrative. It was then that many of those poets went to spend their last days in the north of Spain and Italy, where Occitan poetry had for more than one generation been highly esteemed. Following their example, other poets who were not natives of the south of France began to compose in Occitan, and this fashion continued till, about the middle of the 13th century, they gradually abandoned the foreign tongue in northern Italy, and somewhat later in Catalonia, and took to singing the same airs in the local dialects. About the same time in the Provençal region the flame of poetry had died out save in a few places, Narbonne, Rodez, Foix and Astarac where it kept burning feebly for a little longer. In the 14th century, composition in the language of the country was still practised; but the productions of this period are mainly works for instruction and edification, translations from Latin or sometimes even from French, with an occasional romance. As for the poetry of the troubadours, it was dead for ever.

==Form==

Originally the poems of the troubadours were intended to be sung. The poet usually composed the music as well as the words; and in several cases he owed his fame more to his musical than to his literary ability. Two manuscripts preserve specimens of the music of the troubadours, but, though the subject has been recently investigated, we are hardly able to form a clear opinion of the originality and of the merits of these musical compositions. The following are the principal poetic forms which the troubadours employed. The oldest and most usual generic term is &quot;vers&quot;, by which is understood any composition intended to be sung, no matter what the subject. At the close of the 12th century, it became customary to call all verse treating of love &quot;canso&quot; the name &quot;vers&quot; being then more generally reserved for poems on other themes. The &quot;sirventesc&quot; differs from the vers and the canso only by its subject, being for the most part devoted to moral and political topics.

Peire Cardinal is celebrated for the sirventescs he composed against the clergy of his time. The political poems of Bertran de Born are sirventescs. There is reason to believe that originally this word meant simply a poem composed by a &quot;sirvent&quot; (Latin &quot;serviens&quot;) or man-at-arms. The sirventesc is very frequently composed in the form, sometimes even with rhymes, of a love song having acquired some popularity, so that it might be sung to the same air. The &quot;tenson&quot; is a debate between two interlocutors, each of whom has a stanza, or more generally a group of lines (each group having the same structure) in turn.

The partimen (French &quot;jeu parti&quot;) is also a poetic debate, but it differs from the tenson insofar that the range of debate is limited. In the first stanza one of the partners proposes two alternatives; the other partner chooses one of them and defends it, the opposite side remaining to be defended by the original propounder. Often in a final couplet a judge or arbiter is appointed to decide between the parties. This poetic game is mentioned by William, count of Poitiers, at the end of the 11th century. The &quot;pastoreta&quot;, afterwards &quot;pastorela&quot;, is in general an account of the love adventures of a knight with a shepherdess. All these classes have one form capable of endless variations: five or more stanzas and one or two envois. The &quot;dansa&quot; and &quot;balada&quot;, intended to mark the time in dancing, are pieces with a refrain. The aubade, which has also a refrain, is, as the name indicates, a waking or morning song at the dawning of the day. All those classes are in stanzas. The &quot;descort&quot; is not thus divided, and consequently it must be set to music right through. Its name is derived from the fact that, its component parts not being equal, there is a kind of discord between them. It is generally reserved for themes of love. Other kinds of lyric poems, sometimes with nothing new about them except the name, were developed in the Occitan regions; but those here mentioned are the more important.

===Narrative poetry===

Although the lyrical poetry of the troubadours formed the most original part of Occitan literature, it was not the only kind. Narrative poetry, especially, received in Occitania a great development, and, thanks to recent discoveries, a considerable body of it has already become known. Several classes must be distinguished: the &quot;chanson de geste&quot;, legendary or apparently historical, the romance of adventure and the novel. All these poems are in the form of &quot;chansons de geste&quot;, that is, in stanzas of indefinite length, with a single rhyme.

One notable example is the saga of Girart de Roussillon, a poem of ten thousand verses, which relates the struggles of Charles Martel with his powerful vassal the Burgundian Gerard of Roussillon. Girart de Roussillon belongs only within certain limits to the Occitan literature, as it exists in two versions, one in Old Occitan and one in a hybrid language, which seems to have originated on the borders of Limousin and Poitou; both are probably a recast of an older poem, probably either of French or Burgundian origin, which is no longer extant.

To Limousin also seems to belong the poem of &quot;Aigar and Maurin&quot; (end of the 12th century), of which we have only a fragment so short that the subject cannot be clearly made out.

Of less heroic character is the poem of Daurel and Beton (first half of the 13th century), connected with the cycle of Charlemagne but, judging by the romantic character of the events, more like a regular romance of adventure. We cannot, however, form a complete judgment in regard to it, as the only manuscript in which it has been preserved is defective at the close, and that to an amount there is no means of ascertaining.

Midway between legend and history may be classified the &quot;Cansó d&#x27;Antioca&quot;, a mere fragment of which, 700 verses, has been recovered in Madrid and published in &quot;Archives de l&#x27;Orient latin&quot;, vol. ii. This poem, which seems to have been composed by a Gregory Bechada, mentioned in a 12th-century chronicle and written in Limousin is one of the sources of the Spanish compilation &quot;La gran conquista de Ultramar&quot;.

To history proper belongs the &quot;Song of the Albigensian Crusade&quot;, which, in its present state, is composed of two poems tacked onto each other: the first, containing the events from the beginning of the crusade till 1213, is the work of a cleric named William of Tudela, a moderate supporter of the crusaders; the second, from 1213 to 1218, is by a vehement opponent of the enterprise. The language and style of the two parts differs as well.

Finally, around 1280, Guillaume Anelier, a native of Toulouse, composed a poem on the war carried on in Navarre by the French in 1276 and 1277. It is an historical work of little literary merit.

Gerard of Roussillon, Aigar and Maurin and Daurel and Beton are in verses of ten, the others in verses of twelve syllables. The peculiarity of the versification in Gerard is that the pause in the line occurs after the sixth syllable, and not, as is usual, after the fourth.

Like the chanson de geste, the romance of adventure is but slightly represented in the south; but it is to be remembered that many works of this class must have perished, as evidenced by the fact that, with few exceptions, the narrative poems which survived are known by a single manuscript only. Only three Provençal romances of adventure are extant, &quot;Jaufri&quot; (composed in the middle of the 13th century and dedicated to a king of Aragon, possibly James I), &quot;Blandin of Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Guillem de La Barra&quot;. The first two are connected with the Arthurian cycle. The &quot;romance of Guillem de La Barra&quot; tells a strange story also found in Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; (2nd Day, viii.); it was finished in 1318, and is dedicated to a noble of Languedoc called Sicart de Montaut. Of these, only &quot;Jaufri&quot; is considered of any literary merit .

Connected with the romance of adventure is the novel (&quot;novas&quot; in Occitan), which is originally an account of an event newly happened. The novel must have been at first in the south what, as we see by the &quot;Decameron&quot;, it was in Italy, a society pastime with the wits in turn relating anecdotes, true or imaginary, which they think likely to amuse their auditors. But before long this kind of production was treated in verse, the form adopted being that of the romances of adventure octosyllabic verses rhyming in pairs. Some of those novels which have come down to us may be ranked with the most graceful works in Provençal literature; two are from the pen of the Catalan author Raimon Vidal de Besalu. One, the &quot;Castia-gilos&quot; (the &quot;Chastisement of the Jealous Man&quot;), is a treatment, not easily matched for elegance, of a frequently-handled theme the story of the husband who, in order to entrap his wife, takes the disguise of the lover whom she is expecting and receives with satisfaction blows intended, as he thinks, for him whose part he is playing; the other, &quot;The Judgment of Love&quot;, is the recital of a question of the law of love, departing considerably from the subjects usually treated in the novels. Mention may also be made of &quot;Las novas del papagay&quot; by Arnaut de Carcassès, in which the principal character is a parrot of great eloquence and ability, who succeeds marvellously in securing the success of the amorous enterprises of his master.

Novels came to be extended to the proportions of a long romance. &quot;Flamenca&quot;, which belongs to the novel type, has still over eight thousand verses, though the only MS. of it has lost some leaves both at the beginning and at the end. This poem, composed in all probability in 1234, is the story of a lady who by very ingenious devices, not unlike those employed in the &quot;Miles gloriosus&quot; of Plautus, succeeds in eluding the vigilance of her jealous husband. No analysis can be given here of a work the action of which is highly complicated; suffice it to remark that there is no book in medieval literature which betokens so much quickness of intellect and is so instructive in regard to the manners and usages of polite society in the 13th century. We know that novels were in great favor in the south of France, although the specimens preserved are not very numerous. Statements made by Francesco da Barberino (early part of the 14th century), and recently brought to light, give us a glimpse of several works of this class which have been lost. From the Occitan territories the novel spread into Catalonia, where we find in the 14th century a number of novels in verse very similar to the Provençal ones, and into Italy, where in general the prose form has been adopted.

==Didactic and religious poetry==

Compositions intended for instruction, correction and edification were very numerous in the south of France as well as elsewhere, and, in spite of the enormous losses sustained by Provençal literature, much of this kind still remains. But it is seldom that such works have much originality or literary value. Originality was naturally absent, as the aim of the writers was mainly to bring the teachings contained in Latin works within the reach of lay hearers or readers. Literary value was not of course excluded by the lack of originality, but by an unfortunate chance the greater part of those who sought to instruct or edify, and attempted to substitute moral works for secular productions in favor with the people, were, with a few exceptions, persons of limited ability. It would be out of question to enumerate here all the didactic treatises, all the lives of saints, all the treatises of popular theology and morals, all the books of devotion, all the pious canticles, composed in Occitan verse during the Middle Ages; still some of these poems may be singled out.

Daude de Pradas (early 13th century), a canon of Maguelone, and at the same time a troubadour, has left a poem, the , which is one of the best sources for the study of falconry. Raimon d&#x27;Avignon, otherwise unknown, translated in verses, about the year 1200, Rogerius&#x27; &quot;Surgery&quot; (Romania, x. 63 and 496). There is also a poem on astrology by a certain C. (Guilhem?), and another, anonymous, on geomancy, both written about the end of the 13th century. The troubadour Raimon de Castelnou, active around 1274, wrote a treatise on doctrine and ethics, entitled &quot;Doctrinal&quot;.

As to moral compositions, we have to recall the Boethius poem (unfortunately a mere fragment) already mentioned as one of the oldest documents of the language, and really a remarkable work; and to notice an early (12th century?) metrical translation of the famous &quot;Disticha de moribus&quot; of Dionysius Cato (Romania, xxv. 98, and xxix. 445). More original are some compositions of an educational character known under the name of &quot;ensenhamenz&quot;, and, in some respects, comparable to the English nurture-books.

The most interesting are those of Garin le Brun (12th century), Arnaut de Mareuil, Arnaut Guilhem de Marsan, Amanieu de Sescas. Their general object is the education of ladies of rank. Of metrical lives of saints we possess about a dozen, written early in the 12th century; the &quot;Life of St Enimia&quot; (13th century), by Bertran of Marseilles, and that of St Honorat of Lerins by Raimon Feraud (about 1300), which is distinguished by variety and elegance of versification, but it is almost entirely a translation from Latin. Lives of saints (St Andrew, St Thomas the Apostle, St John the Evangelist) form a part of a poem, strictly didactic, which stands out by reason of its great extent (nearly thirty-five thousand verses) and the somewhat original conception of its scheme - the &quot;Breviars damor&quot;, a vast encyclopedia, on a theological basis, composed by the Minorite friar Matfre Ermengaut of Bezers between 1288 and 1300 or thereabout.

==Drama==
Dramatic literature in Occitan consists of mysteries and miracle plays seldom exceeding two or three thousand lines, which never developed into the enormous dramas of northern France, whose acting required several consecutive days. Comic plays, so plentiful in medieval French literature (farces, sotties), do not seem to have found favor in the south. Specimens which we possess of Occitan drama are, comparatively few; but researches in local archives, especially in old account books, have brought to light a considerable number of entries concerning the acting, at public expense, of religious plays, called, in Latin documents, &quot;historia&quot; or &quot;moralitas&quot;, most of which seem to be irretrievably lost. The &quot;Sponsus&quot;, in both Latin and Occitan, is preserved from the mid-11th century and may have non-liturgical roots. It shows originality in both the treatment of its biblical theme and its musical accompaniment, since it was sung in its entirety. As all the Occitan plays, sometimes mere fragments, which have escaped destruction, are preserved in about a dozen manuscripts, unearthed within the last forty or fifty years. Generally those plays belong to the 15th century or to the sixteenth. Still, a few are more ancient and may be ascribed to the 14th century or even to the end of the thirteenth. The oldest appears to be the &quot;Mystery of St Agnes&quot; (edited by Bartsch, 1869), written in Arles. Somewhat more recent, but not later than the beginning of the 14th century, is a &quot;Passion of Christ&quot; (not yet printed) and a &quot;mystery of the Marriage of the Virgin&quot;, which is partly adapted from a French poem of the 13th century, (see Romania xvi. 71). A manuscript, discovered in private archives (printed by Alfred Jeanroy and Henri Teulié, 1893), contains not less than sixteen short mysteries, three founded on the Old Testament, thirteen on the New. They were, written in Rouergue and are partly imitated from French mysteries.

At Manosque (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence) was found a fragment of a inserted in a register of notarial deeds (printed by C. Arnaud) of some kind. In 1513 French poems were first admitted in the competitions, and under Louis XIV (from 1679) these were alone held eligible. This unfair arrangement, by which some of the leading poets of northern France profited, held good till 1893, when the town very properly transferred its patronage to a new , but very soon restored its support to the older institution, on learning that Occitan poetry was again to be encouraged.

==From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century==

In the two centuries that followed the medieval there was a succession of works, chiefly of a didactic and edifying character, which scarcely belong to the realm of literature proper, but at least served to keep alive some kind of literary tradition. This dreary interval was relieved by a number of religious mystery plays, which, though dull by modern tastes, probably gave keen enjoyment to the people, and represent a more popular genre; the latest that have been preserved may be placed between the years 1450 and 1515.

In the opinion of Hermann Oelsner (&quot;Provençal Literature&quot;, &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 11th ed., 1911) not only did the literature deteriorate during this period, but dialects took the place of the uniform literary language employed by the troubadours, while the spoken tongue yielded more and more to French. In 1539 François I, with the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, forbade the use of Occitan in official documents a fact that is worthy of note only as being significant in itself, not as an important factor in the decadence of Provençal letters. At about this time, there are signs of a revival. In 1565 the Gascon, Pey de Garros, translated the Psalms into his dialect, and two years later published a volume of poems. His love for his native tongue is genuine, and his command over it considerable; he deplores its neglect, and urges others to follow his example. Auger Gaillard (c. 1530–1595) does infinitely less credit to his province: the popularity of his light pieces was probably due to their obscenity. More in the spirit of Garros is the charming trilingual composed by the famous du Bartas in honor of a visit of Marguerite de Valois to Nérac (1579): three nymphs dispute as to whether she should be welcomed in Latin, French, or Gascon, and the last, of course, wins the day.

Provence proper gave birth to a poet of considerable importance in Louis Bellaud de la Bellaudire (1532–1588), of Grasse, who, after studying at Aix, enlisted in the royal armies, and was made a prisoner at Moulins in 1572. During his captivity he wrote poems inspired by real love of liberty and of his native country (Don-Don internal, 1584 or 1585). At Aix Bellaud subsequently became the centre of a literary circle which included most of the local celebrities; all of these paid their tribute to the poets memory in the edition of his works published by his uncle, Pierre Paul, himself the author of pieces of small value, included in the same volume (, Marseilles, 1595). Oelsner states that even when Bellaud is wholly frivolous, and intent on worldly pleasures only, his work has interest as reflecting the merry, careless life of the time.

A writer very popular in Provence for the light-hearted productions of his youth was (1570–1650), remarkable chiefly for comedies that deal largely with duped husbands (, not published till 1628). Oelsner states that there is a certain charm, too, in the comedies of Claude&#x27;s disciple, (, 1655); and those critics who have read the plays of Joan de Cabanas (1653–1712) and of Seguin (of Tarascon, c. 1640), still in manuscript in 1911, speak highly of them.

The most consistently popular form of poetry in the south of France was always the novel. There has been no limit to the production of these; but very rarely does the author deserve special mention. An exception must be made in the case of Nicolas Saboly (1614–1675), who in the opinion of Oelsner produced the best pieces of this class, both as regards beauty of language and the devotion they breathe. They have deservedly maintained their popularity to the present day. In Languedoc four poets have been cited as the best of the age Goudelin, Michel, LeSage and Bonnet.

Oelsner states that this is certainly so in the case of Pierre Goudelin (, 1579–1649), of Toulouse, the most distinguished name in Occitan literature between the period of the troubadours and that of Jasmin. He had a good classical education, traces of which appear in all his poetry, his language and his manner being always admirable, even where his matter is lacking in depth. He is often called the Malherbe of the South, but resembles that writer only in form: his poetry, taken as a whole, has far more sap. Goudelin essayed and was successful in almost every short genre (, 1617, republished with additions till 1678), the piece of his which is most generally admired being the stanzas to Henry IV of France, though others will prefer him in his gayer moods. He enjoyed enormous popularity (extending to Spain and Italy), but never prostituted his art to cheap effects. His influence, especially but not exclusively in the Occitan area, has been deep and lasting. The fame of Jean Michel, of Nîmes, rests on the &#x27;, a poem of astonishing vigour, but deficient in taste. Daniel Sage, of Montpellier (, 1650), was a man of loose morals, which are reflected in nearly all his works: his moments of genuine inspiration from other causes are rare. More worthy of being bracketed with Goudelin is Bonnet, author of the best among the open air plays that were annually performed at Béziers on Ascension Day: a number of these (dated 1616–1657) were subsequently collected, but none can compare with the opening one, Bonnet&#x27;s &#x27;.

Another poet is Nicolas Fizes, of Frontignan, whose play, the (1670), dealing with a slight love intrigue, and an idyllic poem on the fountain of Frontignan, show a real poetic gift. A number of Toulouse poets, mostly laureats of the Academy, may be termed followers of Goudelin: of these François Boudet deserves mention, who composed an ode, (1678), in honor of his native dialect.

The classical revival about this time is also generally ascribed to Goudelin&#x27;s influence. Its best known representative was Jean de Vales, of Montech, who made excellent translations from Virgil and Persius, and wrote a brilliant burlesque of the former in the manner of Scarron (, 1648; only four books published). He also composed a pastoral idyll, which, though too long and inclined to obscenity, contains much tender description. The greatest of the pastoral poets was Frariois de Cortete (1571–1655), of Prades, whose comedies, and (published, unfortunately with alterations, by his son in 1684), are written with such true feeling and in so pure a style that they can be read with real pleasure. A comedy of his dealing with Sancho Panza in the palace of the Duke has been edited.
Armand Daubasse (1664–1727), of Quercy, who belonged to the working classes was very polular; he was patronized by the nobility in exchange for panegyrics. Gascony produced two typical works in the 17th century: (1610) and D&#x27;Astròs&#x27;s (1642). The former depicts a regular boasting Gascon who distinguishes himself in everything; while the latter is a plea in favor of the Gascon tongue, inspired by a genuine love of country. Gabriel Bedout (, 1642) is chiefly noted for his , called forth by the sufferings he endured from a hardhearted mistress. (1612–1662), living peacefully in his native village of Pouy-Loubrin, celebrated it with great tenderness.

In the 18th century the number of authors is much larger. The priests are mainly responsible for the literary output of Languedoc. Claude Peyrot (1709–1795) one of them, celebrates his county with true rural spirit in the and . But the chief of the band is (1727–1783), the prior of Celleneuve, whose , delivered by a drunken priest against intemperance, is a masterpiece. He also wrote a successful mock-heroic poem () travesties of Homer and Virgil, a prose novel depicting the country manners of the time (), and two comedies, which likewise give a vivid picture of the village life he knew so well.

In the opinion of Oelsner the two genuine poets are the brothers Rigaud of Montpellier: Augustes (1760–1835) description of a vintage is deservedly famous; and Cyrille (1750—1820s) produced an equally delightful poem in the . Pierre Hellies of Toulouse (d. 1724) a poet of the people, whose vicious life finds an echo in his works, has a certain rude charm, at times distantly recalling Villon. In the Province François Toussaint Gros (1698–1748), of Lyon, holds, in the view of Oelsner, undisputed sway. Oelsner states that his style and language are admirable, but unfortunately he wasted his gifts largely on trivial . Coye&#x27;s 1711–1777) comedy, the , is bright and still popular, while Germain&#x27;s description of a visit paid by the ancient gods to Marseille (, 1760) has considerable humour; and that in Gascony the greatest poet was Cyprien Despourrins (1698–1755), whose pastoral idylls and mournful chansons, which he himself set to music, are imbued with tenderness and charm.

The French Revolution produced a large body of literature, but nothing of lasting interest. However, it gave an impetus to thought in the Occitan area, as elsewhere; and there, as elsewhere, it called forth a spirit of independence that was all in favor of a literary revival. Scholars of the stamp of Raynouard (1761–1863), of Aix, occupied themselves with the brilliant literary traditions of the Middle Ages; newspapers sprang up (the Provençal , started by Joseph Desanat, and the bilingual , edited by Bellot, both in 1842); poets banded together and collected their pieces in volume form (thus, the nine troubaire who published in 1823).

==Félibrige==
Much has been written about the , and critics are sorely at variance as to the writers that most deserve this appellation. We shall not go far wrong if we include in the list Hyacinthe Morel (1756–1829), of Avignon, whose collection of poems, &quot;Lou Saboulet&quot;, has been republished by Frédéric Mistral; Louis Aubanel (178~-1842), of Nîmes, the successful translator of Anacreon&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot;; Auguste Tandon, the troubadour of Montpellier, who wrote &quot;Fables, contes et autres pièces en vers&quot; (1800); Fabre d&#x27;Olivet, the versatile littérateur who in 1803 published &quot;Le Troubadour: Poésies occitaniques&quot;, which, in order to secure their success, he gave out as the work of some medieval poet Diou-loufet (1771–1840), who wrote a didactic poem, in the manner of Virgil, relating to silkworm-breeding (&quot;Leis magnans&quot;); Jacques Azais (1778–1856), author of satires, fables, etc.; d&#x27;Astros (1780–1863), a writer of fables in La Fontaine&#x27;s manner; Castil-Blaze, who found time, amidst his musical pursuits, to compose Provençal poems, intended to be set to music; the Marquis de la Fare-Alais (1791–1846), author of some light satirical tales (&quot;Las Castagnados&quot;).

While these writers were all more or less academic, and appealed to the cultured few, four poets of the people addressed a far wider public: Verdi (1779–1820), of Bordeaux, who wrote comic and satirical pieces; Jean Reboul (1796–1864), the baker of Nîmes, who never surpassed his first effort, &quot;L&#x27;Ange et l&#x27;enfant&quot; (1828); Victor Gelu (1806–1885), relentless and brutal, but undeniably powerful of his kind (&quot;Fenian é Grouman; dix chansons provençales&quot;, 1840); and, greatest of them all, the true and acknowledged forerunner of the felibres, Jacques Jasmin, whose poems, both lyrical and narrative, continue to find favour with men of the highest culture and literary attainments, as with the villagers for whom they were primarily intended.

While much of this literature was still in the making, an event took place which was destined to eclipse in importance any that had gone before. In 1845 Joseph Roumanille of Saint-Rémy (Bouches-du-Rhône), became usher in a small school at Avignon, which was attended by Frédéric Mistral, a native of the same district, then fifteen years of age. The former, feeling the germs of poetry within him, had composed some pieces in French; but, finding that his old mother could not understand them, he was greatly distressed, and determined thenceforth to write in his native dialect only. These poems revealed a new world to young Mistral, and spurred him on to the resolve that became the one purpose of his life &quot;de remettre en lumière et conscience de sa gloire cette noble race que Mirabeau nomme encore la nation provençale&quot;.

Mistral&#x27;s personality and works are certainly better known than his fellows&#x27;. Still, in studying the Provençal renaissance, Roumanille&#x27;s great claims should not be overlooked, and they have never been put forward with more force than by Mistral himself (in the &quot;preface to his Isclos doro&quot;). Roumanille&#x27;s secular verse cannot fail to appeal to every lover of pure and sincere poetry (&quot;Li Margarideto&quot;, 1836–1847; &quot;Li Sounjarello&quot;, 1852; &quot;Li Flour de Sauvi&quot;, 1850, 1859, etc.), his novels are second only to those of Saboly, his prose works (such as &quot;Lou mege de Cucugnan&quot;, 1863) sparkling with delightful humour. He it was who in 1852 collected and published &quot;Li Prouvençalo&quot;, an anthology in which all the names yet to become famous, and most of those famous already (such as Jasmin), are represented. In 1853 he was one of the enthusiastic circle that had gathered round J.B. Gaut at Aix, and whose literary output is contained in the &quot;Roumavagi dei Troubaire&quot; and in the short lived journal &quot;Lou gay saber&quot; (1854).

At the same time the first attempt at regulating the orthography of Provençal was made by him (in the introduction to his play, &quot;La Part dou bon Dieu&quot;, 1853). And in 1854 he was one of the seven poets who, on May 21, foregathered at the castle of Fontsgugne, near Avignon, and founded the Félibrige. The etymology of this word has given rise to much speculation: the one thing certain about the word is that Mistral came across it in an old Provençal poem, which tells how the Virgin meets Jesus in the Temple, among the seven &quot;felibres&quot; of the law. The outlines of the constitution, as finally settled in 1876, are as follows.
The region of the Felibrige is divided into four &quot;mantenenço&quot; (Provence, Languedoc, Aquitaine and Catalonia). At the head of all is a consistori of fifty (called &quot;majourau&quot;), presided over by the &quot;Capoulié&quot;, who is chief of the entire Felibrige. The head of each mantenenço is called &quot;sendi&quot; (who is at the same time a &quot;majourau&quot;); and at the head of each school (as the subdivisions of the mantenenço are called) is a &quot;cabiscòu&quot;. The ordinary members, unlimited in number, are &quot;mantenèire&quot;. Annual meetings and fetes are organized. The most widely read of the Felibrige publications is the &quot;Armana prouvençau&quot;, which has appeared annually since, maintaining all the while its original scope and purpose; and though unpretentious in form, it contains much of the best work of the school. The other six were Mistral, Théodore Aubanel, Anselme Mathieu (a school fellow of Mistral&#x27;s at Avignon), E. Garcin, Alphonse Tavan and Paul Giéra (owner of the castle). Of these, Théodore Aubanel has alone proved himself worthy to rank with Mistral and Roumanille.

Zani, the girl of his youthful and passionate love, took the veil; and this event cast a shadow over his whole life, and determined the character of all his poetry (&quot;La miougrano entre-duberto&quot;, 1860; &quot;Li Fiho d&#x27;Avignoun&quot;, 1883). His is, without a doubt, the deepest nature and temperament among the felibres, and his lyrics are the most poignant. He has a keen sense of physical beauty in woman, and his verse is replete with suppressed passion, but he never sinks to sensuality. His powerful love drama &quot;Lou pau dou peccat&quot; was received with enthusiasm at Montpellier in 1878, and successfully produced (some years later in Arnes version) by Antoine at his Theatre Libreno mean criterion. It is the only play of real consequence that the school has yet produced. We need not do more than glance at the work of the fourth of the group of poets who alone, amidst the numerous writers of lyrics and other works that attain a high level of excellence appear to to have so far secured permanent fame by the magnitude of their achievement.

Felix Gras settled at Avignon in his youth. His rustic epic, &quot;Li Carbounié&quot; (1876) is full of elemental passion and abounds in fine descriptions of scenery, but it lacks proportion. The heroic geste of &quot;Toloza&quot; (1882), in which Simon de Montfort&#x27;s invasion of the south is depicted with unbounded vigour and intensity, shows a great advance in art. &quot;Lou Roumancero prouvençau&quot; (1887) is a collection of poems instinct with Provençal lore, and in &quot;Li Papalino&quot; (1891) we have some charming prose tales that bring to life again the Avignon of the popes. Finally, the poet gave us three tales dealing with the period of the Revolution (&quot;Li Rouge dóu miejour&quot;, etc.); their realism and literary art called forth general admiration.

While Mistral and many of the best felibres employ the dialect of the Bouches-du-Rhône, others, who have since seceded as the &quot;Félibrige Latin&quot; (headed by Roque-Ferrier), prefer to use the dialect of Montpellier, owing to its central position. A third class favors the dialect of Limousin, considering it has been used by the troubadours. Nearly all the leaders of the Felibrige are Legitimists and Catholics.

There are exceptions, however, chief among them the Protestant Gras, whose &quot;Toloza&quot; clearly reflects his sympathy with the Albigenses. Yet this did not stand in the way of his election as Capoulié proof, if proof were needed, that literary merit outweighs all other considerations in this artistic body of men. Finally, it may be noted that the felibres have often been accused of lack of patriotism towards northern France, of schemes of decentralization, and other heresies; but none of these charges holds good. The spirit of the movement, as represented by its leaders, has never been expressed with greater terseness, force and truth than in the three verses set by Felix Gras at the head of his Carbounié: &quot;I love my village more than thy village; I love my Provence more than thy province; I love France more than all&quot;.

==Late twentieth and twenty-first century==
Despite two hundred years of suppression by successive French centralist governments and the official prohibition of the language at school, in the administration and in the media, Occitan and Occitania have never ceased to inspire poets and authors. To the day, Article II of the French Constitution denies the existence and legitimacy of culturally rich and elaborate idioms such as Catalan, Breton, Basque and Occitan, among others. And though the use of the latter has been greatly affected by what is known as la Vergonha — which is the physical, legal, artistic and moral repression of the tongue in all areas of society aiming at making children feel &quot;ashamed&quot; of their parents&#x27; language to the benefit of French, — every region of the country of Òc gave birth to literary geniuses: Joan Bodon in Guyenne, Marcela Delpastre in Limousin, Robèrt Lafont in Provence, Bernat Manciet in Gascony and Max Roqueta in Languedoc.

All genres of modern international literature are present in Occitan, especially since the second half of the 20th century, although some avant-garde Occitan literature already existed from the late 19th century.
