<text>The Parliament of Victoria is the bicameral legislature of the Australian state of Victoria that follows a Westminster-derived parliamentary system. It consists of the King, represented by the governor of Victoria, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. Members of the Victorian government are drawn from both chambers, creating a fused executive. The parliament meets at Parliament House in the state capital Melbourne. The current Parliament was elected on 26 November 2022, sworn in on 20 December 2022 and is the 60th parliament in Victoria.

The two Houses of Parliament have 128 members in total, 88 in the Legislative Assembly (lower house) and 40 in the Legislative Council (upper house). Victoria has compulsory voting and uses full preferential voting in single-member seats for the Legislative Assembly, and single transferable vote in multi-member seats for the proportionally represented Legislative Council. The council is described as a house of review. Majorities in the Legislative Council are rare, so the government of the day must negotiate with other parties to pass much of its legislative agenda. All members serve four-year terms. The parliament&#x27;s functions and processes have evolved over time, undergoing significant changes as Victoria changed from an independent colony to a state within the federated Australia.

The Parliament may make laws for any matter within Victoria, subject to some referendum requirements in the Victorian Constitution. Its power is further limited by the ability for the federal laws to override state laws, subject to the Australian Constitution. State courts are responsible for interpreting the laws of Parliament, subject to appeal to the High Court of Australia. The parliament is also vested with other powers, such as the means to investigate matters, conduct research and summon witnesses.

Government is formed by the party or parties who command confidence and supply within the Assembly. The leader of the governing party or parties is the premier, the most senior elected member of Victoria&#x27;s executive government. Victorians do not directly elect the premier, and the leader of the majority party is appointed premier by the governor. Jacinta Allan has been the premier since her selection as leader of the Labor Party on 27 September 2023.

==History==
===Location===
Parliament has sat at Parliament House, Melbourne since 1856, with the exception of the period 1901–1927, when Parliament House was used by the Federal Parliament and the Parliament of Victoria sat at the Royal Exhibition Building. The building has undergone significant renovations since its initial construction as it has been expanded, repaired and restored over time. The first major works were conducted in the 1930s, using a £50,000 contribution from the Australian federal government paid in gratitude for the use of the building. Further construction was undertaken throughout the 1970s to make temporary offices for members of Parliament, although these were not modernised until further works began in 2015. Sections of the structure&#x27;s outer walls have gradually been replaced over time.

===Early parliamentary history===

Prior to 1851 the area of Australia now known as Victoria was part of the colony of New South Wales and was administered by the Government of New South Wales in Sydney. On 5 August 1850, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the &quot;Australian Colonies Government Act&quot; which made provision for the separation of Victoria from New South Wales. Enabling legislation was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales, and Victoria was formally created a separate colony of the United Kingdom on 1 July 1851.

The &quot;Australian Colonies Government Act&quot; provided for the colony to be administered by a lieutenant-governor and a Legislative Council of 51 members, 21 of which were to be elected and the remainder appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. The lieutenant-governor was subordinate in some matters to the governor of New South Wales, who was given the title governor-general. The Legislative Council met for the first time in November 1851 at St Patrick&#x27;s Hall, Melbourne. The first Legislative Council existed for five years and was responsible for at least three significant and enduring contributions to the parliamentary system of Victoria: drafting the first Constitution of Victoria, ensuring a secret ballot within elections (a novelty within the British Empire at the time), and ordering the construction of Victorian Parliament House in Melbourne.

The Victorian Constitution was approved by the Legislative Council in March 1854. It was the sent to Britain where it was passed by the United Kingdom Parliament as the &quot;Victoria Constitution Act 1855.&quot; It was granted royal assent on 16 July 1855 and was proclaimed in Victoria on 23 November 1855. The constitution established the Westminster-style system of responsible government that continues in Victoria today. It further stipulated several preconditions on voting that have since been rescinded such as restricting voting to only men of at least 21 years of age who met minimum wealth standards. Rural districts were also very over-represented in order to favour large landowners.

The election for the first Victorian Parliament was held during the spring of 1856, the first Victorian Members of Parliament met on 21 November 1856 in the recently completed Parliament House and were sworn in, and on 25 November 1856 the first Victorian Parliament was officially opened by acting governor Major-General Edward Macarthur. The Legislative Council consisted of thirty members representing six Provinces, each province returning five members. The Legislative Assembly consisted of sixty members representing thirty-seven multi and single-member electorates.

===Expansion of suffrage===
Although Indigenous Australians were denied the vote in some states, Victoria did not directly legislate voting based on race. Therefore, Indigenous Victorian men were entitled to vote from 1857, provided they met the other requirements. Furthermore, Indigenous Victorians who enrolled to vote in Victoria were allowed to vote in federal elections from 1901.

The 1903 constitution, similar to the functional constituencies in China, reserved two seats in the Legislative Assembly to be elected by and from Railway Officers and similarly one seat for Public Officers, and one seat in the Legislative Council for both groups combined. In 1907, these four seats were abolished and such officers voted instead in their electoral district and province and were otherwise prohibited from political campaigning.

Voting was initially restricted based on gender, though. Victoria was the last state within Australia to intentionally recognise female voters. The &quot;Electoral Act 1863&quot; granted the vote to all rate payers, which included some women at the time. Therefore, women were legally allowed to, and indeed did, vote in the election of 1864. The act was clarified in 1865 to exclude women. Agitation for allowing women to vote began in earnest in 1891, with presentation of an immense petition containing over 30,000 signatures was presented to the parliament. This petition was proudly used as a promotional tool for the federation of Australia. The newly federated nation allowed women to vote in elections, as well as stand for office, since 1902. Yet Victoria did not expand its suffrage to include women until 1908, nor allow women to stand for office until 1924. The first woman was not elected into the Victorian Parliament until 1933.

Political parties began to increase in size and influence throughout the 1890s, leading to further agitation for changes to the vote. This also led to voting within each chamber becoming more predictable, as strong party discipline began to form among party members, mostly aligned to three broad ideals: the labour movement, liberal movement and rural interests. Victoria&#x27;s two-party system took hold, usually as a contest between the Labor Party and a coalition formed by the Country Party (now known as the Nationals) and the more recent Liberal Party.

The principle of ensuring that rural regions, which typically represented the landed gentry when Victoria first formed, were over-represented in parliament was also rescinded. One-man-one vote was adopted in 1899 in the Legislative Assembly, and expanded to the Legislative Council in 1937. Wealth requirements for voting in the Legislative Assembly were removed in 1857, but this reform was not made to the Legislative Council until 1950. Furthermore, the method of voting was changed; first-past-the-post voting was replaced with preferential voting for the Legislative Assembly in 1911 and compulsory voting introduced in 1923. Meanwhile, the preferential voting was used for elections to the Legislative Council from 1921, and elections made compulsory in 1935.

Voting was further expanded in 1973, when the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18. The minimum age for membership of either house was also lowered to 18.

===Expansion of voting divisions===

The number of divisions within each of the chambers was gradually increased over time. The Legislative Council was expanded from 30 members representing 6 provinces to its peak of 48 members spread throughout 14 provinces by 1888. The number of both provinces and members continued to change until it remained relatively fixed by 1974, when 44 members represented 22 provinces. Furthermore, the members were distributed evenly, rather than a mixture of single and multi-member districts as the chamber was at its creation.

The Legislative Assembly has similarly fluctuated in size over time. It contained 60 seats within its first iteration in 1856, eventually growing to as many as 95 by 1900. It was not until 1958 when all divisions were up for election at the same time, though, when all of the then 66 seats were contested. The Assembly reached 88 seats in 1985 and has remained at this number ever since.

===Current voting methods and districts===
Until November 2006, the Legislative Council had 44 members serving eight-year terms, elected from single-member constituencies, with half the seats falling vacant every four years. Since then it has had 40 members, each serving four-year terms. They are elected from eight multi-member constituencies, each returning five members, and elected by proportional representation. Since 2006, the Legislative Assembly has had 88 members elected for fixed four-year terms from single-member constituencies, using preferential voting.

Fixed four-year terms were introduced for both houses in 2003, replacing the previous provision that allowed the government to expire after no more than four years.

==Composition and electoral systems==
Parliament consists of the King and two houses: the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. The governor acts on behalf of the monarch.

All members of both houses are elected for fixed four-year terms. General elections are held on the last Saturday in November every four years with the parliament expiring on the Tuesday twenty-five days before the election. The most recent general election was held on 26 November 2022.

Parliament can be dissolved earlier by the governor, and a general election called, in two exceptional circumstances:
* the Legislative Assembly passes a motion of no confidence in the government or its ministers, or
* the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly are deadlocked and cannot agree to pass a bill.

Anyone enrolled to vote in Victoria can stand for election as a candidate for either House, except for:
* a judge of the Victorian Courts,
* a member of the Commonwealth Parliament,
* an undischarged bankrupt, or
* someone convicted of a serious criminal offence.

It is also not permitted to be a member of both houses or a candidate for election to both houses of Parliament.

Members of Parliament may be addressed by their name or by using their electorate, for example &quot;The Member for Hawthorn&quot; or &quot;Member for Southern Metropolitan Region&quot;, and are entitled to the postnominal letters MLC if a Member of the Legislative Council, and MLA or MP if a Member of the Legislative Assembly. Ministers and former ministers are entitled to the style &quot;The Honourable&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;The Hon&quot;) although some choose not to use it.

The government of the day sits on benches to the right of the presiding officer within each chamber, while the opposition sits to the left. Members of a house who are not part of either the official government or opposition sit on the benches in between them, called the cross bench. This arrangement is used in the Legislative Council even though the governing parties rarely command a majority within it.

The Government and Opposition appoint members as Managers of Government and Opposition Business in each house. These members are not within the control of the house in the same way that the president and speaker are, they are appointed by the premier and the leader of the Opposition respectively. Each party represented in each house appoints a member as their party whip. The whip&#x27;s main duty is to ensure that all of the members of their party are present within a chamber when a formal vote takes place.

===Legislative Assembly===
The Legislative Assembly is the house of government, in that the government of the day must command a majority of support in this chamber. Furthermore, the premier and ministers are accountable to Parliament and must face questioning and scrutiny from Parliament. The Assembly schedules question time and has time and subject limits on the ways that Ministers must respond to matters raised to them by any other member of the Assembly.

It consists of 88 members who are elected for four-year terms using full preferential voting. Casual vacancies in the Assembly are filled by a by-election within the electorate.

The Assembly functions as a representation of Victoria and commanding a majority within the Assembly provides a mandate for government policies. The Assembly is the only chamber authorised to draw funds from the public treasury, or to raise taxes, on its own initiative. Changes to taxation or funding for projects can still be debated by the Council, but the Assembly may always authorise funding for the ordinary operation of government without needing Council approval. If the Council does not pass the Assembly&#x27;s budget within a month it is passed to the governor for royal assent regardless. This means that, unlike the Australian Senate, the other chamber of Victoria&#x27;s parliament cannot block supply for government funding.

The Assembly has increased in power over time compared to the Legislative Council. It is assumed that the government of the day will act upon the initiatives it campaigned on and the Assembly serves as a direct link between local members and each individual constituency. Furthermore, while it is not a requirement that ministers come from the Assembly, it is convention that more members of the executive branch sit within the Assembly than the Council.

Most bills originate within the Assembly, partly as a matter of convention and mostly due to the fact that bills not sponsored by the government are unlikely to be passed. A bill typically goes through three readings, each followed by a vote, before being presented to the Legislative Council.

===Legislative Council===
The Legislative Council primarily acts as a house of review. It has equal power to the Legislative of Assembly, except in relation to appropriation bills. It contains 40 members, elected from eight multi-member electorates known as regions. Each region returns five members for a four-year term. Each region contains eleven divisions from the Legislative Assembly. The Council is elected using a single transferable vote with the option of group voting tickets. Casual vacancies are filled by a joint-sitting of both houses. The new member must be from the same party as the original member was at the time of their election.

The Council&#x27;s power has decreased over time, as its role has changed. It was initially a means of suppressing democratic reforms, particularly since the more representative Assembly was seen as too liberal and radical. It now serves as a house of review, more closely modelled on the Australian Senate than on the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Lords. Majorities within the Council are rare by design, while minority interest groups are more likely to be elected than within the Assembly, encouraging debate and compromise.

The governor&#x27;s opening address to Parliament occurs in the Council. The governor does not enter the Assembly, in keeping with the Westminster tradition of regal and vice-regal persons not entering into the chamber modelled on the House of Commons.

Bills passed by the Assembly must also pass the Council within the same form. Either house can propose amendments to bills and all bills and their amendments, with the exception of supply bills, must pass both houses. The Council may debate supply bills but cannot amend them. In the event that the Council does not pass a budget within a month of it passing the Assembly it is passed onto the governor for royal assent regardless of how (or even if) the Council voted on it.

===Presiding officers===

The speaker of the Legislative Assembly is the presiding officer of the Legislative Assembly. The speaker is an elected member of the parliament and is chosen by the members of the Legislative Assembly to chair their meetings and represent the assembly as a whole at official functions. The corresponding person in the Legislative Council is the president of the Legislative Council. Both the speaker and the president have important powers in controlling debate in their respective chambers, including the ability to punish members who step out of line or disobey their orders. The presiding officers also have powers to summon witnesses to the chamber to assist in the legislative role of Parliament.

The presiding officers also oversee votes within their respective chambers and provide proof of assent in the instance that a bill is passed. This proof is needed for a bill to be presented to the governor for royal assent.

The presiding officers&#x27; voting roles are different. The speaker of the Assembly only has a casting vote, while the president of the Council only has a deliberative vote. The speaker may therefore only vote when a matter is tied, with their casting vote determining the outcome. This is consistent with the Westminster tradition of the speaker acting as an impartial arbiter. Some pieces of legislation, such as altering the Constitution, require an absolute majority (45 of the 88 possible votes) to pass. It is therefore mathematically impossible for a speaker to pass such legislation with their casting vote, as the largest possible tied vote is 43:43. The president used to have the same power, but their role has changed over time. Consequently, the president now has a deliberative vote but not a casting vote. This is modelled on the Australian Senate and ensures that a region of Victoria would not be deprived of one of its five votes. A tied vote in the council is considered to have failed to pass regardless of how the president cast their vote. The president does not need to move to one end of the chamber during a division, but instead advises the clerk which way they are voting.

==Parliamentary Committees==

Committees are made of members of either house. They have a specifically defined role designed to seek community input about ideas or to investigate matters Parliament deems important. The membership of a committee is determined by the parliament, usually as a new parliament begins. Each committee contains members of many political parties, not just the governing parties, although the government still generally aims to give itself functional majorities within each committee. Lobbyists, members of the public and organisations communicate with committees in order to give input into the drafting of bills. The Parliament of Victoria outlines the committee process as:
# Terms of reference
# Calling for submissions
# Public hearings
# Research
# Reporting to Parliament
# Government response
The government will usually be given six months to respond to the committee&#x27;s recommendations. As they need as broad an understanding as possible of the issues at hand, committees may perform inquiries with the authority to subpoena documents and summon witnesses. This assists with research and is a means of holding parties to account. Committees have broad powers when performing inquiries although there are some legal protections in place for witnesses, similar to those for witnesses in the judicial system.

The different types of committees are: &quot;joint investigatory committees&quot;, comprising members of both houses, &quot;standing committees&quot;, comprising members of the Legislative Council, &quot;select committees&quot;, comprising members of one house or the other, and &quot;domestic committees&quot;, which are generally closed to the public as they concern matters of the parliament itself.

Parliament&#x27;s current committees are:

=== Joint committees ===
* Dispute Resolution
* Electoral Oversight
* Integrity and Oversight
* Public Accounts and Estimates
* Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations

=== Legislative Council committees ===
* Economy and Infrastructure
* Environment and Planning
* Legal and Social Issues
* Privileges
* Procedure

=== Legislative Assembly committees ===
* Economy and Infrastructure
* Environment and Planning
* Legal and Social Issues
* Privileges
* Procedure

==Procedure==
Parliamentary days follow a regular routine. Each sitting day begins with a prayer, and also an acknowledgement to country in respect to Victoria&#x27;s Indigenous people. A quorum must be present for a day&#x27;s proceedings to be legally binding, so the presiding officer will generally wait until enough members are within the chamber before entering. Members may only speak in the chamber when given leave to do so by the presiding officer.

A proposed petition, motion or bill can be introduced into either house, but in practice most are introduced into the Legislative Assembly. Any statute bill, with the exception of bills appropriating money for the ordinary annual services of government, must be passed by both Houses before being presented to the governor, who will sign the bill into law on behalf of the King. Ordinary appropriation bills need only be passed by the Legislative Assembly before being presented to the governor for royal assent.

The parliamentary process extends beyond each chamber in turn. Proposed bills and motions will usually be passed separately within their party caucus before they are brought to Parliament. The governing party or parties will also generally only propose bills that have the approval of the relevant minister, and which have already been agreed upon during a cabinet meeting. Cabinet members have large flexibility in drafting bills. They are nonetheless limited by policies that require them to propose bills only within their specific portfolios, and to only allow amendments to existing bills that are relevant to the bill in question. Input is sought from various public groups, private interests and public servants.

===Committee process===

As a general rule, official government policy is based on advice given by a committee. This ensures further public input as committees consist of members from many parties. Bills are then drafted by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to ensure that all relevant clauses and technicalities in existing laws are covered. Any member, whether in government or otherwise, may draft their own bill. Bills are almost always tabled to Parliament by a minister; any bills proposed by someone other than a Cabinet member are referred to as a private member&#x27;s bill. Any private member&#x27;s bill is usually drafted by the member in question without input from the OCPC.

===Debate and vote===
The presiding officer of a house determines when a bill, motion or petition is tabled by adding it to the notice paper for a given sitting day. Members must provide notice so that enough time is available to allow for proper debate and scrutiny. The presiding officer will also schedule subsequent readings based on how each house votes; if the bill is passed on its second reading, then it is common to provide for two weeks before the next.

A bill usually goes through three readings once it is tabled in a house. The bill&#x27;s details remain confidential except to parliament, other than the title, during the first reading to the house from which it originated. Members have a chance to read and analyse the bill at their leisure. It goes to a second reading if the house moves to do so. The Assembly refers to this as &quot;Consideration in Detail&quot; whereas it is called &quot;Committee of the Whole&quot; in the council. Debates occur at this stage, as members of the house may scrutinise the bill&#x27;s merits, propose amendments or move that the bill be dismissed altogether. The bill will be read clause by clause, allowing for all technicalities and edge cases to be discussed. The house will often vote on amendments at this stage as a result of debate and discussion. Any proposed amendments to bills under debate must be relevant. Some bills, such as those that continue routine matters of governance or that do not face opposition, may skip this stage by a unanimous vote. Finally, the house may then go to a third reading, typically two weeks after debate is adjourned following the second reading. The bill is read in full in its final form to ensure that all members can scrutinise the final bill and its amendments (if any). The house&#x27;s formal vote after the third reading passes the bill in that house and the presiding officer certifies it. This process must occur in both houses for a bill to become law.

Voting in the house can be either be passed by the presiding officer simply asking members to call out their assent by stating, &quot;Aye,&quot; or dissent by stating, &quot;No.&quot; They then decide which side wins based on the volume. This process of voting &quot;on the voices&quot; is common for matters with little opposition. However, any member may challenge the presiding officer&#x27;s ruling and ask for a division. This leads to bells being rung and members either stand to the presiding officer&#x27;s right if they assent or to the left if they dissent. A count is conducted and a record of how each member voted is taken. If a house amends the draft bill, then the other house must separately agree to the same amendments. This means that it is returned to the other chamber for another vote. The bill is usually not read out in full again, rather only the amendment in question.

===Royal assent===

Once both houses agree to the bill, and both presiding officers have certified the votes, it is presented to the governor. The governor provides royal assent on behalf of the King, after which the bill with either take effect immediately, or at a time specified in the bill. The governor may not refuse to assent to a bill, except possibly in extreme circumstances where the judiciary and all other constitutional safeguards were unavailable. The governor also has the formal power to return a bill to the houses with suggested amendments, however this is power exercised only on ministerial advice and has only been used to correct minor errors discovered in a bill before it has received assent.

==Functions==
The parliament has the power to make laws for Victoria on any matter, subject only to limitations placed on it by the Constitution of Australia, which specifies which matters fall under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Constitution identifies three areas of legislative power: &quot;exclusive powers&quot;, which may only be exercised by the federal parliament, &quot;concurrent powers&quot;, where may be exercised by both the states or federal parliament, and &quot;residual powers&quot; which remain the exclusive prerogative of state parliaments. Concurrent powers are limited further, as when a state law and federal law come into conflict, the federal law prevails to the extent of any inconsistency. Exclusive powers deal with matters that affect the entire nation or anything occurring on federal land. For instance, no state may create its own currency, nor raise its own defence force. However, the federal parliament may only make laws for matters to which it has been specifically granted the ability to do so by Australia&#x27;s Constitution. Therefore, the remaining powers remain the legal domain of each state parliament in turn. The Treasury Corporation of Victoria outlines that the Victorian Parliament&#x27;s key responsibilities are: &quot;education, public health, police and justice, transport, roads and railways, industry, mining and agriculture, public works, ports, forestry, electricity, gas, and water supply and irrigation&quot;.

The parliament may levy its own taxes, however, income taxes have been the exclusive domain of the federal government for decades. The state government&#x27;s chief means of revenue (outside of grants from the federal government) comes from a combination of payroll taxes, stamp duties on housing and vehicles and a portion of the goods and services tax that is divided amongst all states. The Victorian Government may never levy new taxes, nor spend funds unless it has been specifically authorised to do so by the parliament. It may spend funds raised by taxes from the federal government, although such spending must still be approved by the Victorian Parliament. Victoria has deferred its powers to the federal parliament over time as Australia has concentrated power into its federal government. This is most often done with the practice of &quot;tied grants&quot;, whereby the federal government funds projects that are administered at a state level, such as road and rail, but these grants are only given on the condition that the Victorian Parliament also assents to preconditions laid out by its federal counterpart.

The Parliament of Victoria is a bicameral legislature. It usually fulfils its legislative role by first proposing bills in the Legislative Assembly, and then reviewing them in the Legislative Council. Common practice is that the houses sit in staggered dates; the Assembly usually meeting first in order to pass bills that the Council later debates. These houses sit in separate chambers.

The parliament also has the ability to amend Victoria&#x27;s constitution, although this power is subject to strict requirements. All sections must be passed by an absolute majority of each house (currently 45 in the Assembly and 21 in the council), regardless of how many members are present in the chamber. Alterations to Victoria&#x27;s Constitution made in 2003 stipulate that some sections may not be modified without a three-fifths majority of both houses, while others may not be amended without a public referendum. However, since neither of these requirements were themselves passed by such majorities it is unlikely that the clauses could not simply be removed by an absolute majority in both chambers at a later date.

Parliament undertakes investigative and research roles. Each house has a number of committees that investigate proposed laws in detail before they are considered by the whole house. They may be formed for research purposes or to seek community input. This function is assisted by the fact that committees include members of more than one political party. Some of the committee work is carried out by the Joint Committees which consist of members from all sides of politics and from both chambers. Like the parliament, the committees cease to exist when the parliament is dissolved by the governor, and need to be recreated after each general election. This means that often the names and jurisdiction of the committees are changed.

The houses provide oversight of the government of the day. Committees may also investigate the effectiveness of existing laws and regulations. Similarly, parliamentary committees may also investigate potential breaches of law or conventions by the government. General practice is that committees are given two weeks to investigate potential impacts on the wider community any bill may have as part of a bill&#x27;s second reading within a house.

==Conflict between the houses==
The Victorian Parliament&#x27;s process of resolving disputes between the two houses is modelled on the Australian Parliament&#x27;s. However, the process also includes additional steps and modifications. A bill that is passed by the Assembly but rejected by the council, termed a &quot;Disputed Bill&quot; may be amended by the council and returned to the Assembly within 2 months. If the Assembly does not endorse the amendments then a dispute resolution committee may be formed. This process does not apply to ordinary appropriation bills, which need only pass the Legislative Assembly. The committee must consist of 7 members from the Assembly and 5 from the council, each appointed by their respective house. This committee is often formed following an election in anticipation of its usage later. The committee is given 30 days to resolve the dispute in secret and then present their compromise bill to Parliament.

If the committee either cannot reach an agreement, or the parliament does not pass the committee&#x27;s suggestion, then the bill is termed a &quot;Deadlocked Bill.&quot; At this point, the Premier may advise for a fresh election of the Assembly (and only the Assembly), after which the bill may then go before a joint sitting of both houses. A Deadlocked Bill would likely pass a joint sitting, due to the fact that the Assembly is more than twice the size of the council. Such a bill is treated as though it has passed both houses in the normal fashion.

==Relationship with government==
Parliament functions as the legislative branch of the Victorian level of government. It passes laws or amends existing laws to assist in the governance of the state on behalf the Victorian people, to whom Parliament is answerable through elections. Victoria uses a blend of statutory law and common law. The parliament makes statutory law while common law is decided by the judicial branch of government. The government follows the Westminster tradition of having an executive government whose members come from an elected legislature, a fact that is enshrined in Victorian law.

Parliament holds de facto power over other branches of Victoria&#x27;s level of government due to its exclusive power to appropriate funds for any government business. This is why holding confidence of supply within the Assembly is crucial to any party&#x27;s ability to govern; loss of funds could prevent any government business. Parliament&#x27;s ability to scrutinise government business is assisted by independent arbiters such as the auditor-general and ombudsman. Parliament has specifically legislated for these positions, known as &quot;Officers of Parliament&quot; to act as representatives for the public interest. The powers of these officers are designed so that they may operate independent of interference. The auditor-general, for example, is legislated for in the &quot;Audit Act 1994&quot; and oversees the management of public assets and budgetary audits.

===Governor===
The monarch (King Charles III) is technically part of Parliament. The monarch&#x27;s powers are exercised by the governor who is in turn appointed by the King on the advice of the premier. Among the governor&#x27;s vice-regal duties are the opening of Parliament and the signing of acts that are passed by the Victorian Parliament. The governor retains executive powers over the parliament, such as swearing in ministers, issuing writs for election and dissolving the parliament. The governor generally acts on the advice of the premier and the ministers of government when performing these functions. This following of advice reflects how the governor&#x27;s role has changed over time from a powerful executive with veto authority to that of an advisory role limited by convention and precedent. However, the parliament is obliged to observe the governor&#x27;s three rights in overseeing it: the right to be consulted, the right to warn, and the right to encourage. The governor may insist on being consulted on matters before the parliament at any time.

The governor&#x27;s role includes formally opening sessions of parliament with a speech outlining the government&#x27;s legislative agenda. Victoria also has a lieutenant-governor to fulfil the functions of the office when the governor is otherwise unavailable.

The governor is not subordinate to the federal governor-general. All Australian state governors have jurisdiction over their respective states with their commissions coming directly from the monarch.

===Premier and ministry===
The leader of the political party or coalition with a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly is invited by the governor to form a government. The leader of that party is appointed premier and other senior members are appointed ministers with various portfolio responsibilities. The premier and the ministers are generally responsible for tabling legislation to the parliament. The premier is, for the most part, the most powerful executive role within the Victorian government. Similarly, the ministers each oversee a specific task related to a chief responsibility of the government. The premier and the ministry separately form the Victorian Government–the executive branch of the Victorian level of government.

The ministers form the cabinet, a group who meets to discuss and decide the direction of the government. Their specific roles and responsibilities are determined by their party caucuses. There are currently twenty-two ministers within the cabinet. Some responsibilities are delegated to fourteen parliamentary secretaries, who act as junior ministers and usually do not sit in cabinet meetings. The ministers are also referred to as &quot;the front bench&quot; as they sit on the benches at the front of each legislative chamber.

The premier and the ministers must be sitting members of parliament. There is no legal requirement that any of the executive government come from any particular house. However, since the Legislative Assembly must provide confidence and supply to the government of the day, the premier is, by convention, a member of the Legislative Assembly.

===Parties===
Political parties form a central part of the parliamentary system. The government is opposed by an official opposition. The leader of the largest party in opposition becomes the leader of the Opposition. The opposition plays a central role in debating government ideas as well as scrutinising the government&#x27;s business and its agenda. However, the opposition&#x27;s power is limited while the government commands a majority in the Legislative Assembly due to the traditionally strong party discipline throughout Australia. Parties must have at least 500 members on the Victorian electoral roll, have a party constitution and register with the Victorian Electoral Commission to receive official status.

The Labor Party has been in government since 4 December 2014, led by the premier and leader of the Labor Party in Victoria, Jacinta Allan.

The leader of the Opposition is John Pesutto, who was elected as the leader of the Liberal Party on 8 December 2022. The Greens are led by Ellen Sandell.

==Parliamentary sovereignty==

Parliamentary sovereignty within Australia is a complex matter due to the nature of the monarchy, federation, and the gradual centralisation of power into the federal government over time. Victoria&#x27;s Parliament is subjected to the limits of the Commonwealth constitution and its powers stem from the Crown. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Parliament has exclusive powers in some matters that the states may not exercise at all. In matters where the powers of the Victorian and federal parliaments overlap, the federal parliament&#x27;s powers prevail. There are no other restrictions to Parliament&#x27;s authority, though, and the largely ceremonial role the crown has in governance makes Victoria&#x27;s parliament sovereign over Victoria in practice. Such power is nonetheless approved by the governor whose power stems from the monarch. Parliament&#x27;s sovereign power over Victoria is supreme when compared to the equivalent federal parliament&#x27;s power over Australia as a whole; Victoria&#x27;s Constitution does not rigidly define a separation of powers as the Commonwealth&#x27;s constitution does, meaning that all powers residing within the executive and judicial branches of government stem from Parliament. There is no legal impediment, therefore, to Parliament exercising control over the other branches of government.

Parliamentary sovereignty was legally tested following the passage of the &quot;Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities 2006&quot;, which delegated powers to the judiciary to oversee human rights violations within Victoria. Although this allows the judiciary to intervene in Parliament&#x27;s role in certain circumstances, subsequent legal analyses have determined that the courts only have such power as they have been granted by Parliament. In the specific case of the charter, the judiciary may indicate if legislation contravenes the charter but not invalidate the law, although this does not necessarily mean that a future parliament could not alter the charter to give the judiciary this power. Parliament may delegate powers to another branch, but as it may reverse such powers at any time it maintains sovereignty over the other branches of government. Sovereignty is further reinforced by the fact that no Parliament may pass a law that a later Parliament cannot overturn, including the delegation of powers to other branches. All controversial social issues are, in practice and in law, still determined and debated by Parliament.

The 2003 changes to the Victorian Constitution entrenched several provisions, such as the requirement for a public referendum to alter how members of parliament are elected, and the independence of public offices. Such clauses are seen as infringing parliamentary sovereignty, and while they have not been tested in court, it is probable that these clauses are not legally valid. General legal rationale is that a given parliament can always overturn or amend the legislation of its predecessors. The exception to this is that an alteration to the state&#x27;s constitution possibly could be entrenched if it was passed by a public referendum. The &quot;Australia Act 1986 (Commonwealth)&quot; and Westminster tradition place limits on the level to which state constitutions can be entrenched, with the accepted view being that the supposedly entrenched clauses within Victoria&#x27;s constitution could be overturned by a majority of both houses of parliament in the normal fashion.

The practice of allocating tied grants is used by the federal government to circumvent the power of state parliaments. The federal government cannot exercise powers on matters it has not been given responsibility for, unlike the state parliaments whose powers are hardly limited. Victoria&#x27;s Parliament, like all of the states of Australia, has a vertical fiscal imbalance and is dependent on the federal government for about half of its funding. The states gave up their ability to raise income taxes during the Second World War, but they have maintained responsibility for the management of the majority of services. The Australian Parliament typically only funds measures that it finds politically advantageous, though, meaning that it will generally make funding for certain projects conditional on accepting particular terms and conditions. Although this allows the federal government to exercise some control over the states, it does not change nor dilute the sovereignty that the Victorian Parliament wields; there is no way for the Australian Parliament to force the Victorian Parliament to accept a tied grant.

==Salary and allowances==
Members of both the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council are paid a base salary of $182,413 per annum (as of 1 July 2019). In June 2020, the Victorian Independent Remuneration Tribunal announced Victorian MPs would receive no increase in salaries for the financial year 2020–21.

Office holders such as the president, speaker, ministers and party leaders receive additional salary on top of the base salary. The premier is paid an additional 100 percent of the base salary; the leader of the Opposition and government ministers an additional 75 percent; the president and speaker an additional 65 percent.

Members are also entitled to receive various allowances for travel and work costs. Members representing non-Melbourne electorates are also entitled to a second home allowance.

Prior to 1870 only ministers and office holders were provided with a salary. This in effect meant that members had to be wealthy enough to support themselves before seeking election to Parliament. In 1870 the Victorian Parliament provided for the reimbursing of members in relation to their expenses in attending Parliament, in effect the first salary for members of the Victorian Parliament. At first passed as temporary measure, it later became permanent. The act provided for a payment of £300 p.a. to those who did not already receive a salary. This value is difficult to place in a modern context, due to Australia&#x27;s conversion to a decimal currency and the smaller economy of the time. This salary would equate to approximately $35,000 in 2018 dollars based on inflation, but could be as much as approximately $340,000 when measuring it as a relative income of the time.

<text>The Nation of Celestial Space (also known as Celestia) is a micronation created by James Thomas Mangan. Celestia comprised the entirety of &quot;outer space&quot;, which Mangan laid claim to on behalf of humanity to ensure that no one country might establish a political hegemony there. As &quot;Founder and First Representative&quot;, he registered this acquisition with the Recorder of Deeds and Titles of Cook County on January 1, 1949. At its foundation Celestia claimed to have 19 members, among them Mangan&#x27;s daughter Ruth; a decade later a booklet published by the group claimed that membership had grown to 19,057.

Mangan was active for many years in pursuing his claims on behalf of Celestia; in 1949 he notified the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and United Nations that Celestia had banned all further atmospheric nuclear tests. Later, as the space race got underway in earnest he sent angry letters of protest to the leaders of the Soviet Union and United States on the occasions that their early space flights encroached upon his claimed territory - although he later waived these proscriptions to allow for satellite launches by the latter.

Despite these efforts, the Nation of Celestial Space is thought to have become defunct with the death of its founder. Its only surviving legacy is the series of stamps and silver and gold coins and passports issued in its name by Mangan from the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s. 

Some of the coins minted by Celestia included a silver &quot;1 Joule&quot; of 4.15 grams (.925 silver) and a gold &quot;1 Celeston&quot; of 2.20 grams (.900 gold). Their scarcity ensures that they sell for many hundreds of dollars apiece on the rare occasions they come to market.

James Thomas Mangan&#x27;s descendants include his son, James C. Mangan (deceased), his daughter Ruth Mangan Stump, &quot;Princess of the Nation of Celestial Space&quot; (deceased), and three grandsons, Glen Stump, &quot;Duke of Mars&quot;, Dean Stump, &quot;Duke of Selenia &quot; and “First Representative of The Nation of Celestial Space, and Todd Stump, &quot;Duke of the Milky Way&quot;. There are also three sons of Glen Stump, Edward Stump “Duke of Sirius”, Dan Stump “Duke of Polaris” and Luke Walter Stump “Duke of Alpha Centauri”.

==Declaration==
The Declaration by the Nation of Celestial Space was issued by Celestia on December 21, 1948. It proclaims to establish the nation to &quot;secure for sympathetic people, wherever they may live, the beauties and benefits of a vast domain yet unclaimed by any state or nation.&quot; The document goes on to explain the nature of Celestia&#x27;s claim.

<doc id="1123819" wikidata="Q165173" url="?curid=1123819" title="Paulownia">
<text>Paulownia ( ) is a genus of seven to 17 species of hardwood trees (depending on taxonomic authority) in the family Paulowniaceae, the order Lamiales. The genus and family are native to east Asia and are widespread across China. The genus, originally &quot;Pavlovnia&quot; but now usually spelled &quot;Paulownia&quot;, was named in honour of Anna Pavlovna, queen consort of The Netherlands (1795–1865), daughter of Tsar Paul I of Russia. It is also called &quot;princess tree&quot; for the same reason.

It was originally sought after as an exotic ornamental tree in Europe and Asia, and later introduced to North America in 1844. Its fruits (botanically capsules) were also used as packaging material for goods shipped from East Asia to North America, leading to &quot;Paulownia&quot; groves where they were dumped near major ports. The tree has not persisted prominently in US gardens, in part due to its overwintering brown fruits that some consider ugly. In some areas it has escaped cultivation and is found in disturbed plots. Some US authorities consider the genus an invasive species, but in Europe, where it is also grown in gardens, it is not regarded as invasive.

&quot;Paulownia&quot; trees produce as many as 20 million tiny seeds per year. However, the seeds are very susceptible to soil biota and only colonize well on sterile soils (such as after a high temperature wildfire). Well-drained soil is also essential. Successful plantations usually purchase plants that have been professionally propagated from root cuttings or seedlings. Although seeds, seedlings, and roots of even mature trees are susceptible to rot, the wood is not and is used for boat building and surfboards.

Dimensionally stable and given its straight grain and light weight, &quot;Paulownia&quot; timber is extremely easy to work with and is reported to be resistant to decay, with good weathering characteristics.

Trees can grow to maturity in under 10 years and produce strong, lightweight timber, good as firewood, and with an even higher strength to weight ratio than balsa wood. Its density is low at around , although significantly higher than balsa&#x27;s very low .

==Morphology==
&quot;Paulownia&quot; is a genus of angiosperm trees, and one of the fastest-growing trees in the world. &quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot; can grow over tall and has large heart shaped leaves ranging from wide and long with a -long petiole. The leaves grow in opposite decussate pairs, and as the name tomentosa suggests, are covered in hairs. The leaf margin can be toothed or entire and sometimes may be slightly lobed. They can be distinguished from common look-alike genera, such as &quot;Catalpa&quot; and &quot;Cercis&quot;, by secondary and tertiary venation. The leaves are late to come in on the tree and late to fall from the typically deciduous &quot;Paulownia&quot;. However, in tropical areas, the tree can be evergreen.

The leaves are often preceded by pale violet to purple-shaded tubular flowers, similar to a foxglove. Like most members of the Lamiales, the flowers are zygomorphic. The inflorescences are terminal erect -long panicles of ~ long flowers. The thick, fused calyx is covered by a brown hairy indumentum, and the fused calyx tube is the same length as its calyx lobes, except in &quot;P. catalpifolia&quot; and &quot;P. elogata&quot;, in which the lobes are shorter than the calyx tubes. The corolla has five fused lobes with a shorter adaxial bilobed lip, and a somewhat longer abaxial trilobed lower lip. The lips of all the petals are curled and their surface tomentose.

On the inner side of the lower trilobed corolla tube run two light-yellow folded ridges from the calyx to the lip. They are interpreted as floral guides to the top of the corolla tube. Inside the corolla tube, and approximately halfway down, are four stamen filaments fused to the petals at the base, with two being longer than the others. At the bottom of the corolla tube is a short corolla-stamen tube. The base of the stamen filaments are bent so that they run along the upper portion of the flower with the arrow shaped anthers then depositing pollen on the dorsal side of a variety of pollen-feeding insects.

The superior bilocular ovary, surrounded by the brown calyx, with its stigma and style rising up, is approximately the same length as the longer stamen filaments that surround it. That is left on the stem as the corolla and stamen fall off. The stigma tip has a singular small hole that leads to a tubular dilated chamber at the top of the style, covered in receptive papillae. In the species &quot;P. kawakamii&quot;, the stigma tip is slightly bilobed, which is a unique morphological characteristic distinguishing &quot;Paulownia&quot; from all of the Lamiales. At the bottom of the ovary is a nectary, with nectary slits on the basal sides of the ovary, beneath a hairy region. The ovary then develops into a sticky green oval capsule tapered at the apex with the remaining dried up style sometimes still attached.

The capsule remains on the persistent brown calyx where it can last on the tree through the rest of the year before turning brown and woody, and loculicidal dehiscence reveals up to 2000 small winged seeds stacked tightly inside. The tiny seeds have lateral wings that gradually increase in length around the seed. The ventral and dorsal side of the seed are flat. The wing shape on the seeds is another characteristic distinguishing Paulownia from the rest of the Lamiales. The new buds, enclosed by the early brown fuzzy calyx, are visible in late summer to early fall and wait dormant, alongside the brown seed capsules, till spring.

==Fossil record==
&quot;Paulownia&quot; once occurred in North America, with fossilized leaves being found in Tertiary strata of Ellensburg Canyon of Washington state.

&quot;Paulownia&quot; macrofossils have been recovered from the late Zanclean stage of the Pliocene sites in Pocapaglia, Italy and &quot;Paulownia caucasica&quot; macrofossils have been recovered from strata of the Serravallian stage of the Miocene in Georgia in the Caucasus region. It is believed that the climate then would have been suitable for the genus across the whole northern hemisphere.

== Uses ==

In China, &quot;Paulownia&quot; () is popular for roadside planting and as an ornamental tree. &quot;Paulownia&quot; needs much light and does not like high water tables.

As a forestry crop, &quot;Paulownia&quot; are exacting in their requirements, performing well only in very well draining soil, with summer rainfall or availability of irrigation water. &quot;Paulownia&quot; is extremely fast growing, increasing in height by up to in one year when young. Some species of plantation &quot;Paulownia&quot; can be harvested for sawn timber in as little as five years. Once the trees are harvested, they regenerate from their existing root systems, earning them the name of the &quot;Phoenix tree&quot; (that name is alternatively attributed to the belief that it is the only tree within which the phoenix will roost.)

&quot;Paulownia&quot; is also used in Chinese agroforestry systems because it grows quickly, its wood is light but strong, its flowers are rich in nectar, its leaves make good fodder for farm animals, it is deep-rooting, and it is late-leafing, and its canopy is sparse enough to allow crops below it get enough light to grow while being sheltered from the wind.

&quot;Paulownia&quot; is known in Japanese as , specifically referring to &quot;P. tomentosa&quot;; it is also known as the &quot;princess tree&quot;. &quot;Paulownia&quot; is the &quot;mon&quot; of the office of prime minister, and also serves as the Government Seal of Japan used by the Cabinet and the Government of Japan (whereas the chrysanthemum is the Imperial Seal of Japan). It is one of the suits in the card game hanafuda, associated with the month of November or December (some regions reverse the order of these two months).

&quot;Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia&quot; states:

&quot;Paulownia&quot; wood is very light, fine-grained, and warp-resistant. It is the fastest-growing hardwood. It is used for chests, boxes, and clogs (&quot;geta&quot;). The wood is burned to make charcoal for sketching and powder for fireworks, the bark is made into a dye. The silvery-grey wood is sliced into veneers for special visiting cards.&quot;Paulownia&quot; boxes called &quot;tomobako&quot; (ともばこ) protect ceramic works and other fragile items during shipment and storage. The lid of the box usually tied down with a flat ribbon called a &quot;sanada-himo&quot; (真田紐). Japanese wardrobes called tansu (箪笥) as well as much Korean lacquerware is also made from the wood.

It is important in China, Korea, and Japan for making the soundboards of stringed musical instruments such as the &quot;guqin&quot;, &quot;guzheng&quot;, &quot;pipa&quot;, &quot;koto&quot;, and &quot;gayageum&quot;. More recently it is used as body material for low-cost electric guitars, as the core for lightweight touring skis, and for surfboard cores. It is typically used in guitars as the core body, then laminated under a more durable wood.

<text>Ernesto Frits Hoost (born 11 July 1965) is a Dutch retired professional kickboxer. A four-time K-1 World Champion, Hoost is considered to be one of the greatest kickboxers of all time. Debuting in 1993 at the K-1 World Grand Prix 1993, where he came just one win short of the world title, Hoost announced his retirement thirteen years later on 2 December 2006 after the K-1 World GP Final tournament in Tokyo Dome, Japan. Hoost holds notable victories over Peter Aerts (4x), Branko Cikatić, Mirko Cro Cop (3x), Jérôme Le Banner (3x), Andy Hug (3x), Ray Sefo (3x), Musashi (2x), Mike Bernardo, Francisco Filho (2x), Sam Greco, Stefan Leko (3x), Mark Hunt, Cyril Abidi, and Glaube Feitosa.

==Biography==
Hoost was born in Heemskerk, North Holland to Surinamese parents. He played football for amateur club Hollandia until he was 15 years old, when he started training in kickboxing at the newly opened Sokudo Gym. In 1983, he had his first match against Wim Scharrenberg, which he won by knockout in the second round. From 1988, his career accelerated, winning several European and world titles in Savate and Muay Thai. He quit his job as a sports teacher for alternative punished youngsters to focus on his career as a professional fighter.

In the K-1 Grand Prix &#x27;93, the inaugural K-1 World Grand Prix, Hoost defeated Peter Aerts by decision in the quarterfinals, knocked out Maurice Smith in the semifinals, and advanced to the tournament final where he was knocked out by Branko Cikatic. Hoost got another shot at a title on 19 December 1993, when he won the K-2 World Championship, knocking out Changpuek Kiatsongrit in four rounds. This was the only time the K-1 organisation held a K-2 tournament.

Hoost reached the K-1 World Grand Prix Finals again in 1995, but lost to Peter Aerts by a four-round decision. He went on to win every fight for the remainder of that year. In 1996, he lost at the K-1 World Grand Prix 1996 finals to Andy Hug by a five-round split decision. He finally became K-1 World Champion in 1997 when he beat Hug by a three-round unanimous decision.

Hoost was unable to defend his title at the K-1 World Grand Prix 1998 tournament, being technically knocked out in the quarterfinals by Australian Sam Greco due to being unable to start the 3rd round after a cut above his left eye; he was mostly dominated in the fight by Greco.

In 1999, Hoost won his second K-1 World Grand Prix title, beating Mirko Cro Cop by technical knockout in the third round. On 23 April 2000, Hoost avenged his loss to Greco when he beat him by a technical knockout.

Hoost retained the K-1 World Grand Prix Championship title for the third time in 2000 by defeating Ray Sefo. By then, many K-1 fans were hoping for a meeting between Hoost and Bob Sapp. Hoost returned to defend his crown in 2001 defeating Stefan Leko. However, he was forced to retire from the tournament due to an injured shin before the semi-finals.

The highly anticipated fight with Bob Sapp came at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2002 final elimination. Sapp won by technical knockout in the first round after the doctor stopped the match on cuts. Despite the loss he was again matched up with Sapp in the quarter-finals of the K-1 World Grand Prix 2002. After trading knockdowns with Sapp in the first round, Hoost lost again in a wild slugfest when referee Nobuaki Kakuda declared a KO while Hoost was still standing, but after the fight, Sapp turned out to have broken his hand and suffered four cracked ribs, and wasn&#x27;t able to continue, allowing Hoost to replace him in the semi-finals. Hoost beat Ray Sefo in the first round by TKO, after Sefo damaged his shin against Hoost&#x27;s kneecap. Hoost proceeded to his fifth K-1 Finals, and was matched up against Jerome Le Banner. The fight was clearly in Le Banner&#x27;s favour up until the third and final round when Le Banner injured his arm blocking Hoost&#x27;s kick. Hoost aggressively attacked the arm again, forcing Le Banner down with only 94 seconds left in the match, winning by TKO and his fourth Grand Prix Championship. Le Banner suffered a severe compound fracture, putting him out of competition for over a year.

In 2003, Hoost would continue his feud with Bob Sapp in another arena of combat sports, professional wrestling. At AJPW&#x27;s 2nd WRESTLE-1 event held in the Tokyo Dome, Hoost would defeat Sapp after delivering a chair shot and slap to the back of the head which led to a schoolboy pin.

In addition to his Grand Prix titles Ernesto Hoost fought a number of Super fights. In 2004 he was again in the K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 finals, in which he lost to the eventual Grand Prix champion Remy Bonjasky.

In 2006, Hoost declared that he would fight his last tournament in K-1. In the K-1 World Grand Prix 2006, Hoost was defeated in the semi-finals by Semmy Schilt. An emotional Hoost was met with a standing ovation from the audience as he left the arena.

Hoost is well known for training &quot;Knees of Fury&quot; fighters Paul Slowinski (whom he is currently still training). Under his guidance Slowinski has won the K-1 tournament 2007 in Amsterdam. He has also trained in leg strikes, wrestling, and other skills with PRIDE champion Fedor Emelianenko.

Hoost was also present as a cornerman for UFC fighter Antoni Hardonk in Hardonk&#x27;s UFC 85 bout with Eddie Sanchez, his UFC 92 win over Mike Wessel, and his UFC 97 loss to Cheick Kongo.

In 2012, Hoost was invited by the Katana Fighting Series to be guest of honour at their Katana 6 &#x27;Rebellion&#x27; show.

Hoost made a comeback at age 48. In his first fight in over eight years, he scored two knockdowns en route to a unanimous decision victory over Thomas Stanley at &quot;Hoost Cup: Legend&quot; in Nagoya, Japan on 23 March 2014.

He defeated Peter Aerts in their sixth meeting via unanimous decision on 19 October 2014 in Osaka to win the vacant WKO World Heavyweight Championship.

==Fighting style==
Ernesto Hoost is generally considered to be among the greatest strikers of all time. While he lacked the sheer physicality of other heavyweights, he was able to succeed through his superior speed, accuracy, devastating combinations, and tactical brilliance. His nickname &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; stemmed from his ability to throw complex combinations with almost machine-like technical precision. Hoost&#x27;s most feared strike was his signature low kick, which he utilized at the end of his combinations to cripple his opponent throughout the course of a match. He was able to finish top competition such as Ray Sefo, Mirko Cro Cop, and Igor Vovchanchyn through his use of the low kick. Hoost also enjoyed a strong countering game as well as having high defensive acumen. This allowed him to survive when more powerful fighters attempted to brawl, although this notably failed (twice) against the 350 pound Bob Sapp.

==Personal life==
Hoost currently lives in the town of Hoorn, together with his wife and children.

<doc id="1123822" wikidata="Q4741513" url="?curid=1123822" title="Ambitious Card">
<text>The Ambitious Card, or Elevator Card, is a magic effect in which a playing card seems to return to the top of the deck after being placed elsewhere in the middle of the deck. This is a classic effect in card magic and serves as a study subject for students of magic. It is also known as the &quot;Trick that Fooled Houdini&quot;, as Harry Houdini was unable to determine how the trick was done when it was performed for him, multiple times, by Dai Vernon. Most performing card magicians will have developed their own personal Ambitious Card routine.

The effect is often credited to French magician Gustav Alberti, in the mid-19th century. However, there is a related idea in Jean Nicholas Ponsin&#x27;s &quot;Nouvelle Magie Blanche Devoilée&quot;, published in 1854, that might precede that. Many magicians base their routine on Darryl Martinez&#x27;s version, as he issued a comprehensive VHS tape on many variations of accomplishing this effect.

== Effect ==
The magician usually gets a card signed by an audience member and inserts it into the middle of the deck, after which it reappears at the top. This is repeated under more and more improbable conditions, sometimes to humorous effect.

==Methods==

There are many methods for accomplishing the basic effect. These are often based on sleight of hand methods such as the double lift; however, gimmicks can also be used, such as a stripper deck. More detailed descriptions can be found in books such as &quot;The Royal Road to Card Magic&quot;, &quot;The Expert at the Card Table&quot; and &quot;Card College&quot;. Many magicians have come up with their own methods and routines. Dai Vernon&#x27;s Ambitious Card routine, for example, can be found in the book &quot;Stars of Magic&quot;.

== Variations ==
Variations to this trick can be linked together to create routines. Many magicians perform the same routine every time, though the trick is structured such that one is able to combine variations in different ways for each performance. This is one factor which has earned the Ambitious Card the status of a classic effect.

Variations of this effect include:

*The magician has the spectator sign the card to prove there is no duplicate. 
*The spectator is handed the &quot;ambitious card&quot; and asked to put it in the middle, then asked to hold the deck and do some type of magic move, essentially calling the card to the top of the deck himself.
*The spectator marks an X on the back of an indifferent card at the top of the deck, only to see the same X appear on the back of the &quot;ambitious card&quot; after it has risen to the top.
*The &quot;ambitious card&quot; is bent so that it is seen to be physically different from all the other cards, making it clear that it is placed into the middle of the deck, and increasing the amazement of the spectator as it is seen to rise to the top.
*It is told that the &quot;ambitious card&quot; has a connection with the spectator and is shown to come to the top only when spectator commands.
Some variations include an ending to the ambitious card routine, such as a card to shoe, or a card to wallet.

<doc id="1123829" wikidata="Q1931520" url="?curid=1123829" title="Desertshore">
<text>Desertshore is the third studio album by German musician Nico. It was released in December 1970 on the Reprise label and co-produced by John Cale and Joe Boyd.

== Recording ==

&quot;Desertshore&quot; was co-produced by John Cale and Joe Boyd.

&quot;Janitor of Lunacy&quot; was composed as a tribute to her friend Brian Jones, founding member of the Rolling Stones, who had died the previous year.

The back and front covers feature stills from the film &quot;The Inner Scar&quot; by Philippe Garrel which starred Nico, Garrel and her son Ari Boulogne. A few of the songs from the album were included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

== Legacy ==
Like &quot;The Marble Index, Desertshore&quot; obtained a small cult following its release, but was overlooked by most large publications and the public in general. However, it has received mainstream praise from critics in subsequent years with AllMusic and The New Rolling Stone Album Guide in particular providing a strong and positive reception. Tiny Mix Tapes rated &quot;Desertshore&quot; five out of five. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was less favorable—giving the album a &quot;C&quot; rating.

&quot;All That Is My Own&quot; was selected by Morrissey for inclusion on his &quot;Under the Influence&quot; compilation.

&quot;Le petit chevalier&quot; was covered live by Bjork during her &quot;Post tour&quot; in 1996 and also by Bat for Lashes in 2007 at the Glastonbury festival. It was prominently sampled by Abu Lahab on his 2013 album &quot;Of Heliotaxis and Cosmic Knifing&quot;. &quot;Janitor of Lunacy&quot; was covered by Austrian artist Soap&amp;Skin and included in her 2008 debut EP.

== X-TG cover ==

Industrial music pioneers Throbbing Gristle entered the studio to record a reinterpretation of &quot;Desertshore&quot; in 2007. The product of this studio session which was made open-to-the public was &quot;The Desertshore Installation&quot;, a record of the entirety of the 3-day, 12-hour-long session. The plan had been to edit the three days of recordings and craft a finished album from it but the group was not satisfied with the sessions. Peter Christopherson continued working on it in Bangkok with Danny Hyde until his death in November 2010.

Hyde passed the remaining work to Throbbing Gristle members Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti to complete, which they did with the help of several guest vocalists including Marc Almond, Sasha Grey, Blixa Bargeld and Anohni. &quot;Desertshore/The Final Report&quot; was released on 26 November 2012 under the name &quot;X-TG The Album.&quot; It debuted live at AV Festival on 17 March 2012, performed by Carter and Tutti. It was accompanied by a screening of Philippe Garrel’s &quot;La cicatrice intérieure&quot;, &quot;for which &quot;Desertshore&quot; was soundtrack and inspiration&quot;.

== Track listing ==

== Personnel ==

* Nico – vocals, harmonium
* John Cale – all other instruments except trumpet
* John Cale and Adam Miller – harmony voices
* Ari Boulogne – vocals on &quot;Le petit chevalier&quot;

<doc id="1123833" wikidata="Q976400" url="?curid=1123833" title="Macgregor Laird">
<text>Macgregor Laird (1808 – 9 January 1861) was a Scottish merchant pioneer of British trade on the River Niger. Laird&#x27;s commercial expedition between 1832 and 1834 to navigate the Niger and initiate trade between Europeans and Africans northwards of the coast was considered a failure: the majority of the passengers died and the volume of trade realized was minimal. However, his experience provided information about the design of vessels suitable on the Niger and the various settlements in the interior of the Niger Delta.

Laird never returned to Africa but instead devoted himself to the development of trade with West Africa and especially to the opening up of the countries then forming the British protectorates of Nigeria. One of his principal reasons for so doing was his belief that this method was the best means of stopping the slave trade and raising the social condition of Africans.

== Early life ==
Laird was born at Greenock, the younger son of Agnes and William Laird, founder of the Birkenhead firm of shipbuilders of that name. 

His paternal grandfather, John Laird, was a merchant and rope maker in Greenock while his maternal grandfather, Gregor Macgregor, had commanded a ship that undertook voyages between Greenock and the West Indies. Laird&#x27;s brother, John was himself a notable shipbuilder. Laird was educated at Edinburgh University. 

In 1829, while at the university, he fell ill, caused by typhus infection. He was helped to recovery by Dr Thomas Briggs, who later accompanied Laird in the expedition to the Niger.

After graduation, Laird joined the family business in Birkenhead, where he developed an interest in building steamships.

== Career ==

=== Niger voyage ===
In the early 1830s, Richard Lander, an associate of Hugh Clapperton, was provided a subsidy to return to Africa and find the course of the Niger. Following Lander&#x27;s report of reaching the river mouth, enthusiasm for an exploratory team to West Africa grew. The report also rekindled interest in merchants looking for new markets. 

In 1831, after the lower course of the Niger had been made known by Lander and his brother John, Laird and some Liverpool merchants formed the African Inland Commercial Company to commercially develop the region.

Laird worked on the designs of the ships to navigate the Niger. Although the primary aim was to foster trade with the interior communities, Laird also had a personal objective of implementing Christian and humanitarian ideals. 

In 1832, the company sent two small ships and a brig to the Niger. The initial plan of the expedition was to set up the brig at the River Nun, a Niger tributary with history of trade with Europeans, and two paddle vessels to navigate northwards and establish a trading post at Lokoja. The &quot;Alburkah&quot; was a paddle-wheel steamer of fifty-five tons designed by Laird, and was the first iron vessel to make an ocean voyage. The &quot;Quorra&quot;, carrying 29 men, was made of wood; it measured 112 feet in length, with a beam of 16 feet and a draft of eight feet. 

Laird was among 48 European voyagers on the expedition, which was led by Richard Lander. All but nine died from fever or, in the case of Lander, from wounds. Although two doctors came along, quinine was rarely used to treat fever that became more pronounced as they made their ascent up the river; instead, miasma was thought the main contributory reason for an epidemic of fever. Laird went up the Niger to the confluence of the Benue River (then called the Shary or Tchadda), which he was the first white man to ascend. He did not go far up the river but formed an accurate idea as to its source and course.

Laird was weakened by fever and had to return to Fernando Po, where he was received by Colonel Edward Nicolls, the British Governor there, who later became his father-in-law. He rested in Fernando Po before returning to England. Laird and Surgeon R.A.K. Oldfield were the only surviving officers besides Captain (then Lieutenant) William Allen, who accompanied the expedition on the orders of the Admiralty to survey the river. 

In 1837, Laird and Oldfield published the &quot;Narrative of an Expedition into the Interior of Africa by the River Niger in 1832, 1833, 1834&quot;.

=== British and North American Steam Navigation Company ===
Laird was not interested only in Africa. In 1837 he was one of the promoters of a company formed to run steamships between England and New York, and in 1838 the &quot;Sirius&quot;, sent out by this company, was the first ship to cross the Atlantic from Europe entirely under steam.

Between 1835 and 1841, Laird was involved with the British and American Steam Navigation Company. The firm launched a vessel, the &quot;British Queen&quot;, that provided a mail service between England and America, but this venture was unprofitable. It then added another vessel, the &quot;President&quot;, which disappeared en route to England from New York. The company did not survive the disappearance of the &quot;President&quot;, and the navigation firm was liquidated in 1841.

Despite the unsuccessful expedition, Laird continued to stimulate interest in promoting commercial trade in the hinterland of West Africa, particularly within the settlements closest to the mouth of the Niger. He advised merchants to cultivate trade with coastal middlemen as a primary business objective, and as a secondary objective, to send a steam vessel inland to woo communities in the interior and bypass the coastal middlemen.

In 1841, when the British blockade of the coast of West Africa failed to halt the transatlantic slave trade, Laird&#x27;s belief in legitimate trade as a deterrent to slave trading gave way to the idea that cheap labour through unrestricted emigration to the West Indies would cripple the demand for slaves while also increasing production of sugar. In 1838, after the apprenticeship system in West Indies was eliminated ending slavery, Laird advocated voluntary emigration of Africans to West Indies as a way to curtail slavery and also bring Africans in contact to Europeans and their culture. He expressed these views to a parliamentary select committee on the West Coast of Africa in 1842 and to the General Anti-Slavery Convention in 1843.

=== Return to West African trade: the African Steam Navigation Company ===
Laird never went back to West Africa. However, upon renewed government interest in the affairs of West Africa after the appointment of John Beecroft as consul in the Oil Rivers and the 1851 annexation of Lagos, Laird submitted a proposal to the government for regular mail communication by steamship between England and West Africa. The proposal found favour with the government and he was given a mail contract including government subsidies. In 1852, he co-founded the African Steam Navigation Company. In 1854, he set up, with the government&#x27;s support, a small steamer, the &quot;Pleiad.&quot; Under W. B. Baikie, the ship made a successful voyage which enabled Laird to convince the government to sign contracts for annual trading trips by steamers specially built for navigation of the Niger and Benue. Various stations were founded on the Niger, and though government support was withdrawn after the death of Laird and Baikie, British traders continued to frequent the river, which Laird had opened up to little or no personal advantage.

== Personal life ==
In 1837, Laird married Colonel Edward Nicolls&#x27; daughter, Eleanor Hester Nicolls (1811–1898).

Macgregor Laird died in London on 9 January 1861.

<text>Steven Emil Cherundolo (born February 19, 1979) is an American soccer coach and former player who serves as head coach of Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC. A right-back, he was the captain of Hannover 96 of the German Bundesliga, where he spent his entire club career. He represented the United States at the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups.

==Early life==
Born in Rockford, Illinois, Cherundolo grew up in San Diego, California, and attended Mt. Carmel High School in Rancho Peñasquitos. As a youth, he played for the La Jolla Nomads club team, which won the California state championship six times with him.

Before joining Hannover, Cherundolo enrolled at the University of Portland and played for the Pilots soccer team from 1997 to 1998. In his freshman season, he was the West Coast Conference Freshman of the Year.

==Playing club career==
Cherundolo joined Hannover 96, then playing in the 2. Bundesliga, for the end of the 1998–1999 season and quickly received first-team action, playing in four games his first year. Coming into the 1999–2000 season, Cherundolo established himself at the right back position, starting consistently before suffering a knee injury that kept him out until the end of the season and ended his chances of playing for the U.S. Olympic team. He continued to establish his place in the team during the 2000–2001 season, earning playing time in 18 games, including 10 starts. In the 2001–02 season, he started 30 of 34 games for the team as he helped the team gain promotion to the Bundesliga. Cherundolo maintained his position in the 2002–03 season, starting 33 games for the team, while collecting three assists. In the 2003–04 season, he continued his consistent play, appearing in 33 games for the club. Premier League side Bolton Wanderers agreed to a deal with Hannover for Cherundolo in 2005, but he declined, opting to remain in Germany. He signed another contract extension with Hannover in the summer of 2007.

Cherundolo established himself as a leader at Hannover and was appointed team captain shortly before the start of the 2010–11 season. He set the team record for Bundesliga appearances in the second to last game of the 2012–13 season. As of 2013, Cherundolo was the longest serving player in the Bundesliga. On March 19, 2014, Cherundolo announced his retirement from soccer citing failure to recover from a long-term knee injury as the main reason he left the game.

==International career==
Cherundolo parlayed his success in the Bundesliga into a role with the United States national team. Cherundolo made his debut against Jamaica on September 8, 1999. Although he was on the roster for the 2002 FIFA World Cup (a late injury replacement for Chris Armas), Cherundolo himself was injured in training shortly before the event began and was unable to play. In the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup, Cherundolo sustained a knee injury from a tackle that prematurely ended his participation in the tournament. On March 22, 2006, Cherundolo played in a friendly match with the national team against Germany, whose roster included some teammates from Hannover 96. He scored his first international goal in the 4–1 loss.

On May 2, 2006, Cherundolo was named to the U.S. roster for the FIFA World Cup in Germany. On June 12, 2006, for the first time, aged 27, Cherundolo made his debut in a FIFA World Cup match against the Czech Republic, playing in the first half for the U.S., who started the tournament with a 3–0 loss. Five days later, in the second match against Italy (who later won the tournament), Cherundolo played the full 90 minutes, helping the team to a 1–1 draw at Fritz-Walter-Stadion in Kaiserslautern. After a loss against Ghana in the final match in the group, the U.S. was eliminated from the tournament, finishing the group in last place with just one point.

Cherundolo missed the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup due to an injury. He also missed out on the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup due to another injury, but returned to captain the U.S. during the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Cherundolo was one of seven defenders named to the U.S. squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He was given the number 6. In the first match of Group C against England, Cherundolo was in the starting lineup and played the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 draw at Royal Bafokeng Stadium. On June 18, he retained his position for the second match, playing in the entire game against Slovenia, which finished in a 2–2 draw, with the U.S. coming back from 2–0 down. In the 48th minute of the match, Cherundolo assisted Landon Donovan who beat Slovenian goalkeeper Samir Handanović with a powerful shot. In the final match of the group, Cherundolo again started at right back as the U.S. beat Algeria with a last-minute winner, scored by Donovan, to finish the group in first place with five points. U.S. would lose in the Round of 16 against Ghana, 2–1 after extra time. Cherundolo was an ever-present figure in this competition for the United States, playing the entire 390 minutes.

==Coaching career==
Following his retirement announcement, Cherundolo remained with Hannover 96 as an assistant coach for Hannover&#x27;s amateur team. On April 20, 2015, he was officially promoted to assistant coach of Hannover 96&#x27;s first team. After the end of the 2014–15 season, Cherundolo became the head coach of Hannover&#x27;s U–17 academy team.

In January 2018, Cherundolo moved to VfB Stuttgart and became assistant of the new head coach Tayfun Korkut. In November 2018, Cherundolo was named to the coaching staff of the United States national team by interim coach Dave Sarachan.

In an August 2020 interview with the Narrowing the Angle soccer podcast, Cherundolo said he &quot;would love to coach&quot; the US national team and also expressed interest in coaching in Major League Soccer. On August 20, 2020, it was announced that Cherundolo had joined the Germany national youth under-15 football team as an assistant coach.

On March 12, 2021, Cherundolo was named head coach of USL Championship side Las Vegas Lights.

Cherundolo was announced as head coach of Los Angeles FC in Major League Soccer on January 3, 2022. On October 2, 2022, Cherundolo broke the record for most wins as a first-year head coach in Major League Soccer history with 21 wins after Los Angeles FC defeated the Portland Timbers 2–1. The record was previously held by former Los Angeles FC coach Bob Bradley in 1998 with 20 wins, when Bradley was the head coach of the Chicago Fire. The match also clinched the Supporters&#x27; Shield for LAFC, the second in team history, and made Cherundolo the third coach to lead a team to the Shield in his first season in MLS. LAFC would go on to win their first MLS Cup title against the Philadelphia Union in MLS Cup 2022.

==Personal life==
Cherundolo speaks English and German fluently, having spent his entire professional career in Germany. A popular figure with Hannover fans, he is known as &quot;Dolo&quot; and affectionately nicknamed the &quot;Mayor of Hannover&quot;. Cherundolo married Mandy Rosier on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009 at the local St. Joseph Catholic parish church in the Hanover district of Vahrenwald-List. After his retirement from soccer, he has resided with his family in Großburgwedel, near Hanover. In 2021, Cherundolo was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame as a player inductee.

<doc id="1123835" wikidata="Q7502563" url="?curid=1123835" title="Shotover">
<text>Shotover is a hill and forest in the civil parish of Forest Hill with Shotover, in the South Oxfordshire district, in the county of Oxfordshire, England. The hill is east of Oxford. Its highest point is above sea level.

==Early history==
The toponym may be derived from the Old English , meaning &quot;steep slope&quot;. Shotover was part of the Wychwood royal forest from around the period of the Domesday Book until 1660. It was also known as the Forest of Shotover.

A hill figure is recorded as having once been carved on the hill. Antiquarian John Aubrey writes:
:&quot;On Shotover Hill [near Oxford] was heretofore (not long before the Civil Wars, in the memory of man) the effigies of a Giant cut in the earth, as the White Horse by Ashbury Park&quot;

Shotover was formerly an extra-parochial tract, in 1858 Shotover became a separate civil parish, on 25 March 1883 the parish was abolished and merged with Forest Hill. In 1851 it had a population of 163.

==Shotover Road==
The road between London and Oxford used to pass over the top of Shotover Hill. The road was made into a turnpike under the 1719 Stokenchurch Turnpike Act.

==Shotover Park==

Shotover Park and garden were begun in about 1714 for James Tyrrell of Oakley. Tyrell died in 1718 and the house was completed by his son, General James Tyrell. There is no known record of the name of the architect. In 1855 the architect Joshua Sims added two wings in the same style of the original part of the house.

The garden was begun in 1718 and completed in 1730. It is a rare survivor of formal gardens of this period, laid out along an east–west axis long. The centrepiece of the garden east of the house is a straight canal, ending with a Gothic Revival folly. The architect of the folly is unknown, but if it was built before 1742 it may be one of the earliest examples of the Gothic Revival. The garden west of the house has a similarly long vista, ending with an octagonal temple designed in the 1730s by William Kent.

During the Second World War there was a prisoner-of-war camp in the grounds.

Major Alexander Alfred Miller and his youngest brother, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Miller (Crown Equerry 1961–87), both lived in Shotover Park.

Shotover Park and the wider estate is privately owned by the Shotover Trust. It lies on the north and east slopes of Shotover hill and should not be confused with Shotover Country Park (see below).

== Shotover Country Park ==
Shotover Country Park is a public park and nature reserve on the southwest slopes of Shotover Hill managed by Oxford City Council.

==References in popular culture==
&quot;Shotover Hill&quot; is a track on the album &quot;Supergrass&quot; by the Oxford indie band of the same name.

<doc id="1123842" wikidata="Q412007" url="?curid=1123842" title="Malate dehydrogenase">
<text>Malate dehydrogenase () (MDH) is an enzyme that reversibly catalyzes the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate using the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. This reaction is part of many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle. Other malate dehydrogenases, which have other EC numbers and catalyze other reactions oxidizing malate, have qualified names like malate dehydrogenase (NADP+).

== Isozymes ==

Several isozymes of malate dehydrogenase exist. There are two main isoforms in eukaryotic cells. One is found in the mitochondrial matrix, participating as a key enzyme in the citric acid cycle that catalyzes the oxidation of malate. The other is found in the cytoplasm, assisting the malate-aspartate shuttle with exchanging reducing equivalents so that malate can pass through the mitochondrial membrane to be transformed into oxaloacetate for further cellular processes.

Humans and most other mammals express the following two malate dehydrogenases:



==Protein families==

The malate dehydrogenase family contains L-lactate dehydrogenase and L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenases. L-lactate dehydrogenases catalyzes the conversion of L-lactate to pyruvate, the last step in anaerobic glycolysis. The N-terminus is a Rossmann NAD-binding fold and the C-terminus is an unusual alpha+beta fold.

== Evolution and structure ==
In most organisms, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) exists as a homodimeric molecule and is closely related to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in structure. It is a large protein molecule with subunits weighing between 30 and 35 kDa. Based on the amino acid sequences, it seems that MDH has diverged into two main phylogenetic groups that closely resemble either mitochondrial isozymes or cytoplasmic/chloroplast isozymes. Because the sequence identity of malate dehydrogenase in the mitochondria is more closely related to its prokaryotic ancestors in comparison to the cytoplasmic isozyme, the theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts were developed through endosymbiosis is plausible. The amino acid sequences of archaeal MDH are more similar to that of LDH than that of MDH of other organisms. This indicates that there is a possible evolutionary linkage between lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase.

Each subunit of the malate dehydrogenase dimer has two distinct domains that vary in structure and functionality. A parallel β-sheet structure makes up the NAD+ binding domain, while four β-sheets and one α-helix comprise the central NAD+ binding site. The subunits are held together through extensive hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions.

Malate dehydrogenase has also been shown to have a mobile loop region that plays a crucial role in the enzyme&#x27;s catalytic activity. Studies have shown that conformational change of this loop region from the open conformation to the closed conformation after binding of substrate enhances MDH catalysis through shielding of substrate and catalytic amino acids from solvent. Studies have also indicated that this loop region is highly conserved in malate dehydrogenase.

== Mechanism ==

The active site of malate dehydrogenase is a hydrophobic cavity within the protein complex that has specific binding sites for the substrate and its coenzyme, NAD+. In its active state, MDH undergoes a conformational change that encloses the substrate to minimize solvent exposure and to position key residues in closer proximity to the substrate. The three residues in particular that comprise a catalytic triad are histidine (His-195), aspartate (Asp-168), both of which work together as a proton transfer system, and arginines (Arg-102, Arg-109, Arg-171), which secure the substrate.

Mechanistically, malate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of the hydroxyl group of malate by utilizing NAD+ as an electron acceptor. This oxidation step results in the elimination of a proton and a hydride ion from the substrate. NAD+ receives the hydride ion (specifically, the hydride ion is transferred to the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+) and becomes reduced to NADH while concomitantly, the His-195 residue on the enzyme accepts the proton. The positively charged His-195 residue, which is involved in base catalysis of the substrate, is stabilized by the adjacent, negatively charged Asp-168 residue. This electrostatic stabilization helps facilitate the transfer of the proton. Arg-102, Arg-109, and Arg-171 (which are protonated, and thus positively charged) participate in electrostatic catalysis and help to bind the negatively charged carboxylates on the substrate. Additionally, the Arginine residues on the enzyme provide additional substrate specificity and binding through hydrogen bonding between the guanidinium side chain of the Arginine amino acid residues and the carboxylates of the substrate.

Studies have also identified a mobile loop in malate dehydrogenase that participates in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The loop undergoes a conformational change to shield the substrate and catalytic amino acids from the solvent in response to the binding of the malate dehydrogenase:coenzyme complex to substrate. This flipping of the loop to the up position to cover the active site also promotes enhanced interaction of the catalytically important amino residues on the enzyme with the substrate. Additionally, the movement of the loop has been shown to correlate with the rate determining step of the enzyme.

== Function ==
=== Reaction ===
Malate dehydrogenases catalyzes the interconversion of malate to oxaloacetate. In the citric acid cycle, malate dehydrogenase is responsible for catalyzing the regeneration of oxaloacetate This reaction occurs through the oxidation of hydroxyl group on malate and reduction of NAD+. The mechanism of the transfer of the hydride ion to NAD+ is carried out in a similar mechanism seen in lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. The ΔG&#x27;° of malate dehydrogenase is +29.7 kJ/mol and the ΔG (in the cell) is 0 kJ/mol.

=== Other pathways ===
Malate dehydrogenase is also involved in gluconeogenesis, the synthesis of glucose from smaller molecules. Pyruvate in the mitochondria is acted upon by pyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate, a citric acid cycle intermediate. In order to get the oxaloacetate out of the mitochondria, malate dehydrogenase reduces it to malate, and it then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane. Once in the cytosol, the malate is oxidized back to oxaloacetate by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. Finally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) converts oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).

=== Kinetics ===
Kinetic studies show that malate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity is ordered. The cofactor NAD+/NADH is bound to the enzyme before the substrate. The Km value for malate, i.e., the concentration at which the enzyme activity is half-maximal, is 2 mM. The Kcat value is 259.2 s−1.

== Effect of pH on catalytic activity ==
Additionally, pH levels control specificity of substrate binding by malate dehydrogenase due to proton transfer in the catalytic mechanism. A histidine moiety with a pK value of 7.5 has been suggested to play a role in the pH-dependency of the enzyme. Studies have indicated that the binding of the enol form oxaloacetate with the malate dehydrogenase:NADH complex forms much more rapidly at higher pH values. Additionally, L-malate binding to malate dehydrogenase is promoted at alkaline conditions. Consequently, the non-protonated form malate dehydrogenase binds preferentially to L-malate and the enol form of oxaloacetate. In contrast, D-malate, hydroxymalonate, and the keto form of oxaloacetate have been found to bind exclusively to the protonated form of the enzyme. Specifically, when the histidine is protonated, the His residue can form a hydrogen bond with the substrate&#x27;s carbonyl oxygen, which shifts electron density away from the oxygen and makes it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by hydride. This promotes the binding of malate dehydrogenase to these substrates. As a result, at lower pH values malate dehydrogenase binds preferentially to D-malate, hydroxymalonate, and keto-oxaloacetate.

== Allosteric regulation ==

Because malate dehydrogenase is closely tied to the citric acid cycle, studies have proposed and experimentally demonstrated that citrate is an allosteric regulator of malate dehydrogenase depending on the concentrations of L-malate and NAD+. This may be due to deviations observed in the kinetic behavior of malate dehydrogenase at high oxaloacetate and L-malate concentrations. Experiments have shown that Citrate can both allosterically activate and inhibit the enzymatic activity of malate dehydrogenase. Citrate has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of L-malate when there are low levels of L-malate and NAD+. However, in the presence of high levels of malate and NAD+, citrate can stimulate the production of oxaloacetate. Although malate dehydrogenase is typically considered a reversible enzyme, it is believed that there is an allosteric regulatory site on the enzyme where citrate can bind to and drive the reaction equilibrium in either direction.

Glutamate has also been shown to inhibit malate dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, it has been shown that alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase can interact with mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase to form a complex, which can then bind to malate dehydrogenase, forming a ternary complex that reverses inhibitory action on malate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity by glutamate. Additionally, the formation of this complex enables glutamate to react with aminotransferase without interfering activity of malate dehydrogenase. The formation of this ternary complex also facilitates the release of oxaloacetate from malate dehydrogenase to aminotransferase. Kinetically, the binding of malate dehydrogenase to the binary complex of alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and aminotrannferase has been shown to increase reaction rate of malate dehydrogenase because the Km of malate dehydrogenase is decreased when it is bound as part of this complex.

<text>Quarantine Island (also known as Kamau Taurua and officially gazetted as Quarantine Island / Kamau Taurua), is the largest island in Otago Harbour, close to the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. The island covers an area of , and is a publicly accessible recreation reserve. The buildings on the island are owned by Quarantine Island / Kamau Taurua Community Incorporated (QIKTC). Its management is shared between QIKTC and the Department of Conservation.

A smaller island, Rakiriri, lies close to Quarantine Island. Both islands lie across the harbour between the town of Port Chalmers and the marine laboratory on Portobello Peninsula, part of the Otago Peninsula.

== Names ==

The island has been known by a number of names, including St Martin Island. In 1996 as part of the Ngāi Tahu Treaty of Waitangi settlement the name of &quot;Kamau Taurua&quot;, meaning &#x27;a place to set nets&#x27; was restored as part of the official name of Quarantine Island / Kamau Taurua.

== History ==
The island served as the quarantine station for Otago from 1863 until 1924. It was one of four in New Zealand. When ships arrived in Otago harbour with infectious diseases, passengers were quarantined for that disease, usually one to two weeks, but sometimes longer. The few passengers that were actually sick were treated in the hospital on top of the island. In total 41 ships were quarantined at the island. Of about 9,000 people quarantined about 70 died. There is a small cemetery on the island where they and some of the keeper&#x27;s family are buried.

During the First World War, soldiers who had venereal diseases (either diagnosed when they volunteered or acquired abroad) were treated on the island, then called the &#x27;Port Chalmers Military Hospital&#x27;. However, most New Zealand soldiers with VD were treated overseas.

Only one of the main quarantine buildings from these years has survived, and this is now saved. The island has a Heritage New Zealand Historic Area classification. After the quarantine station closed in 1924 the buildings were sold and island was leased.

== Visitors ==
Now the area around the buildings is leased by QIKTC, established in 1958 as St Martin Island Community, and the remainder jointly managed by the Community and the Department of Conservation. The resident keeper welcomes visitors to St Martin Lodge, and oversees a wide range of ecological, educational, historical and cultural projects.

<text>Jane Monheit (born November 3, 1977) is an American jazz and traditional pop singer.

==Early life==
Monheit was born and raised in Oakdale, New York, on Long Island. Her father played banjo and guitar. Her mother sang and played music for her by singers who could also be her teachers, beginning with Ella Fitzgerald. At an early age, Monheit was drawn to jazz and Broadway musicals.

She began singing professionally while attending Connetquot High School in Bohemia, New York. She attended the Usdan Summer Camp for the Arts. At the Manhattan School of Music she studied voice under Peter Eldridge; she graduated in 1999.

She was runner-up to Teri Thornton in the 1998 vocal competition at the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, in Washington, DC.

==Career==
When she was 22, she released her first album, &quot;Never Never Land&quot; (N-Coded, 2000). Like Fitzgerald, she recorded many songs from the Great American Songbook. After recording for five labels, she started her own, Emerald City Records. Its first release was &quot;The Songbook Sessions&quot; (2016), an homage to Fitzgerald.

Monheit&#x27;s vocals were featured in the 2010 film &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; for the titular song, written by Luther Dixon, and credited to the fictional Judy Bridgewater. (On her debut album, she had performed a different song by the same name, written by Livingston and Evans.)

<doc id="1123846" wikidata="Q1519335" url="?curid=1123846" title="Ghost story">
<text>A ghost story is any piece of fiction, or drama, that includes a ghost, or simply takes as a premise the possibility of ghosts or characters&#x27; belief in them. The &quot;ghost&quot; may appear of its own accord or be summoned by magic. Linked to the ghost is the idea of a &quot;haunting&quot;, where a supernatural entity is tied to a place, object or person. Ghost stories are commonly examples of ghostlore.

Colloquially, the term &quot;ghost story&quot; can refer to any kind of scary story. In a narrower sense, the ghost story has been developed as a short story format, within genre fiction. It is a form of supernatural fiction and specifically of weird fiction, and is often a horror story.

While ghost stories are often explicitly meant to scare, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to morality tales. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or prophets of things to come.

== History ==

A widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. Anthropologists link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person&#x27;s spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person&#x27;s breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.

The campfire story, a form of oral storytelling, often involves recounting ghost stories, or other scary stories. Some of the stories are decades old, with varying versions across multiple cultures. Many schools and educational institutions encourage ghost storytelling as part of literature.

In 1929, five key features of the English ghost story were identified in &quot;Some Remarks on Ghost Stories&quot; by M. R. James. As summarized by Frank Coffman for a course in popular imaginative literature, they were:
* The pretense of truth
* &quot;A pleasing terror&quot;
* No gratuitous bloodshed or sex

The introduction of pulp magazines in the early 1900s created new avenues for ghost stories to be published, and they also began to appear in publications such as &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

== Literature ==
=== Early examples ===
Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them. Spirits of the dead appear in literature as early as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which features a journey to the underworld and the hero encountering the ghosts of the dead, as well as the Old Testament in which the Witch of Endor calls the spirit of the prophet Samuel.

The play &quot;Mostellaria&quot;, by the Roman playwright Plautus, is the earliest known work to feature a haunted dwelling, and is sometimes translated as &quot;The Haunted House&quot;. Another early account of a haunted place comes from an account by Pliny the Younger ( 50 AD). Pliny describes the haunting of a house in Athens by a ghost bound in chains, an archetype that would become familiar in later literature.

Ghosts often appeared in the tragedies of the Roman writer Seneca, who would later influence the revival of tragedy on the Renaissance stage, particularly Thomas Kyd and Shakespeare.

The &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, sometimes known as &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, contains a number of ghost stories, often involving jinn (also spelled as djinn), ghouls and corpses. In particular, the tale of &quot;Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad&quot; revolves around a house haunted by jinns. Other medieval Arabic literature, such as the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot;, also contain ghost stories.

The 11th century Japanese work &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; contains ghost stories, and includes characters being possessed by spirits.

=== English Renaissance theatre ===

In the mid-16th century, the works of Seneca were rediscovered by Italian humanists, and they became the models for the revival of tragedy. Seneca&#x27;s influence is particularly evident in Thomas Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, both of which share a revenge theme, a corpse-strewn climax, and ghosts among the cast. The ghosts in &quot;Richard III&quot; also resemble the Senecan model, while the ghost in &quot;Hamlet&quot; plays a more complex role. The shade of Hamlet&#x27;s murdered father in &quot;Hamlet&quot; has become one of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature. In another of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the murdered Banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character.

In English Renaissance theatre, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armour. Armour, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity. The sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 1800s because an armoured ghost had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or lifts, and eventually became clichéd stage elements and objects of ridicule. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in &quot;Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory&quot;, point out, &quot;In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of &#x27;spirit drapery&#x27;.&quot; An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that &quot;at the historical point at which ghosts themselves become increasingly implausible, at least to an educated elite, to believe in them at all it seems to be necessary to assert their immateriality, their invisibility. [...] The drapery of ghosts must now, indeed, be as spiritual as the ghosts themselves. This is a striking departure both from the ghosts of the Renaissance stage and from the Greek and Roman theatrical ghosts upon which that stage drew. The most prominent feature of Renaissance ghosts is precisely their gross materiality. They appear to us conspicuously clothed.&quot;

In Spain, the legend of Catalina Lercaro stands out, a young woman from the 16th century, who committed suicide so as not to have to marry a man she did not love. From here, many people claim to see her ghost.

=== Border ballads ===
Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly the “Border Ballads” of the turbulent border country between England and Scotland. Ballads of this type include &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot;, &quot;The Wife of Usher&#x27;s Well&quot;, and &quot;Sweet William&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children. In the ballad &quot;King Henry&quot;, a particularly ravenous ghost devours the king&#x27;s horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed. The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman. The &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; was a ghost ship that became the subject of many ghost stories.

=== Romantic era ===
One of the key early appearances by ghosts was &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; by Horace Walpole in 1764, considered to be the first gothic novel.
However, although the ghost story shares the use of the supernatural with the Gothic novel, the two forms differ. Ghost stories, unlike Gothic fiction, usually take place in a time and location near to the audience of the story.

The modern short story emerged in Germany in the early decades of the 19th century. Kleist&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar Woman of Locarno&quot;, published in 1810, and several other works from the period lay claim to being the first ghost short stories of a modern type. E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s ghost stories include &quot;The Elementary Spirit&quot; and &quot;The Mines of Falun&quot;.

The Russian equivalent of the ghost story is the &quot;bylichka&quot;. Notable examples of the genre from the 1830s include Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Viy&quot; and Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;, although there were scores of other stories from lesser known writers, produced primarily as Christmas fiction. The Vosges mountain range is the setting for most ghost stories by the French writing team of Erckmann-Chatrian.

One of the earliest writers of ghost stories in English was Sir Walter Scott. His ghost stories, &quot;Wandering Willie&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1824, first published as part of &quot;Redgauntlet&quot;) and &quot;The Tapestried Chamber&quot; (1828) eschewed the &quot;Gothic&quot; style of writing and helped set an example for later writers in the genre.

=== &quot;Golden Age of the Ghost Story&quot; ===
Historian of the ghost story Jack Sullivan has noted that many literary critics argue a &quot;Golden Age of the Ghost Story&quot; existed between the decline of the Gothic novel in the 1830s and the start of the First World War. Sullivan argues that the work of Edgar Allan Poe and Sheridan Le Fanu inaugurated this &quot;Golden Age&quot;.

Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu was one of the most influential writers of ghost stories. Le Fanu&#x27;s collections, such as &quot;In a Glass Darkly&quot; (1872) and &quot;The Purcell Papers&quot; (1880), helped popularise the short story as a medium for ghost fiction. Charlotte Riddell, who wrote fiction as Mrs. J. H. Riddell, created ghost stories which were noted for adept use of the haunted house theme.
The &quot;classic&quot; ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as M. R. James, Sheridan Le Fanu, Violet Hunt, and Henry James. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, &quot;Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, &#x27;the stony grin of unearthly malice&#x27;, pursuing forms in darkness, and &#x27;long-drawn, distant screams&#x27;, are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded ...&quot;.

Famous literary apparitions from the Victorian period are the ghosts of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, in which Ebenezer Scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague Jacob Marley, and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come. In a precursor to &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; Dickens published &quot;The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton&quot;. Dickens also wrote &quot;The Signal-Man&quot;, another work featuring a ghost.

==== Jamesian style ====
David Langford has described British author M. R. James as writing &quot;the 20th century&#x27;s most influential canon of ghost stories&quot;. James perfected a method of story-telling which has since become known as Jamesian, which involved abandoning many of the traditional Gothic elements of his predecessors. The classic Jamesian tale usually includes the following elements:

# a characterful setting in an English village, seaside town or country estate; an ancient town in France, Denmark or Sweden; or a venerable abbey or university
# a nondescript and rather naïve gentleman-scholar as protagonist (often of a reserved nature)
# the discovery of an old book or other antiquarian object that somehow unlocks, calls down the wrath, or at least attracts the unwelcome attention of a supernatural menace, usually from beyond the grave

According to James, the story must &quot;put the reader into the position of saying to himself, &#x27;If I&#x27;m not very careful, something of this kind may happen to me!&quot; He also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion, letting his reader fill in the blanks, and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief. He summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology &quot;Ghosts and Marvels&quot; (Oxford, 1924): &quot;Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are, to me, the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo. ... Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.&quot;

Another aspect James considered a requisite was &quot;that the ghost should be malevolent or odious: amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends, but I have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story.&quot;

Despite his suggestion in the essay &quot;Stories I Have Tried to Write&quot; that writers employ reticence in their work, many of James&#x27;s tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence.

=== 19th-century American writers ===
Influenced by British and German examples, American writers began to produce their own ghost stories. Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1820), based on an earlier German folktale, features a Headless Horseman. It has been adapted for film and television many times, such as &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, a successful 1999 feature film. Irving also wrote &quot;The Adventure of the German Student&quot; and Edgar Allan Poe wrote some stories which contain ghosts, such as &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; and &quot;Morella&quot;.

In the later 19th century, mainstream American writers such as Edith Wharton, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman and F. Marion Crawford all wrote ghost fiction. Henry James also wrote ghost stories, including &quot;The Jolly Corner&quot; and &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;. &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, his most famous ghost story, has appeared in a number of adaptations, notably a film, &quot;The Innocents&quot;, and an opera, Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;.

The introduction of pulp magazines in the early 1900s created new avenues for ghost stories to be published, and they also began to appear in publications such as &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

=== Comedies and operas ===
Oscar Telgmann&#x27;s opera &quot;Leo, the Royal Cadet&quot; (1885) includes &quot;Judge&#x27;s Song&quot; about a ghost at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario.

Oscar Wilde&#x27;s comic short story &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; (1887) has been adapted for film and television on several occasions.

In the United States, prior to and during the First World War, folklorists Olive Dame Campbell and Cecil Sharp collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains, which included ghostly themes such as &quot;The Cruel Ship&#x27;s Carpenter&quot;, &quot;The Suffolk Miracle&quot;, &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot; and &quot;The Wife of Usher&#x27;s Well&quot;. The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover. These songs were variants of traditional British ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo-Scottish border region.

=== Psychological horror ===
In the Edwardian era, Algernon Blackwood (who combined the ghost story with nature mysticism), Oliver Onions (whose ghost stories drew on psychological horror), and William Hope Hodgson (whose ghost tales also contained elements of the sea story and science fiction) helped move the ghost story in new directions.

=== Kaidan ===

Kaidan (怪談), which literally means &quot;supernatural tale&quot; or &quot;weird tale&quot;, is a form of Japanese ghost story. Kaidan entered the vernacular when a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular in the Edo period. The popularity of the game, as well as the acquisition of a printing press, led to the creation of a literary genre called &quot;Kaidanshu&quot;. Kaidan are not always horror stories, they can &quot;be funny, or strange, or just telling about an odd thing that happened one time&quot;.

Lafcadio Hearn published &quot;&quot; in 1904 as a collection of Japanese ghost stories which was also adapted into a film. The book &quot;is seen as the first introduction of Japanese superstition to European and American audiences&quot;.

===Modern era (1920 onward)===
&quot;Ghost Stories&quot; magazine, which contained almost nothing but ghost stories, was published from 1926 to 1932.

Beginning in the 1940s, Fritz Leiber wrote ghost tales set in modern industrial settings, such as &quot;Smoke Ghost&quot; (1941) and &quot;A Bit of the Dark World&quot; (1962). Shirley Jackson made an important contribution to ghost fiction with her novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; (1959).

A noted modern British writer of ghost fiction is Ramsey Campbell. Susan Hill also produced &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; (1983), a ghost novel that has been adapted for stage, television and film.

Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, later made into a 1945 film, places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations.

== Film ==

During the late 1890s the depiction of ghost and supernatural events appear in films. With the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres. The works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions, as well as adaptations of other playwrights and novelists. One of the well known short films was &quot;Haunted Castle&quot; directed by Georges Méliès in 1896. It is also considered as the first silent short film depicting ghost and supernatural events.

In 1926, the novel &quot;Topper&quot; by Thorne Smith was published, which created the modern American ghost. When the novel was adapted into the 1937 movie &quot;Topper&quot;, it initiated a new film genre and would also influence television. After the second World War, sentimental depictions of ghosts had become more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot;, which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968–70 TV series. Genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944&#x27;s &quot;The Uninvited&quot;, and 1945&#x27;s &quot;Dead of Night&quot;. The film &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, based on a play by Noël Coward, was also produced in this period. 1963 saw one of the first major adaptations of a ghost novel, &quot;The Haunting&quot;, based on the well known novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;.

The 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989&#x27;s &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, the 1990 film &quot;Ghost&quot;, and the 1993 comedy &quot;Heart and Souls&quot;. In the horror genre, 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Fog&quot;, and the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence. The 1990s saw a return to classic &quot;gothic&quot; ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films are comedy and mystery from this period include 1984&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;The Others&quot;. The 1990s also saw a lighthearted adaptation of the children&#x27;s character &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot;, originally popular in cartoon form in the 1950s and early 1960s, in the feature film &quot;Casper&quot;.

Asian cinema has also produced horror films about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film &quot;Ringu&quot; (remade in the US as &quot;The Ring&quot; in 2002), and the Pang brothers&#x27; 2002 film &quot;The Eye&quot;. Indian ghost movies are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot; have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages. Generally the films are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts, and usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore. In some cases the Indian films are remakes of western films, such as &quot;Anjaane&quot;, based on Alejandro Amenábar&#x27;s ghost story &quot;The Others&quot;.

== Television ==
In fictional television programming, ghosts have been explored in series such as &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, the television series adaptation of &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; and &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;. In animated fictional television programming, ghosts have served as the central element in series such as &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot;, &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, as well as minor roles in various other television shows.

Popularized in part by the 1984 comedy franchise &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, ghost hunting has been popularized as a hobby wherein reportedly haunted places are explored. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in paranormal reality television series, such as &quot;A Haunting&quot;, &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;, &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;, &quot;Ghost Hunters International&quot;, &quot;Ghost Lab&quot;, and &quot;Most Haunted&quot;. It is also represented in children&#x27;s television by such programs as &quot;The Ghost Hunter&quot; based on the book series of the same name and &quot;Ghost Trackers&quot;.

The Indian television series &quot;Aahat&quot; featured ghost and supernatural stories written by B. P. Singh. It was first aired on 5 October 1995 and ran for more than a decade, ending on 25 November 2010 with more than 450 episodes.

<text>A family history society or genealogical society is a society, often charitable or not-for-profit, that allows member genealogists and family historians to profit from shared knowledge. Large societies often own libraries, sponsor research seminars and foreign trips, and publish journals. Some societies concentrate on a specific niche, such as the family history of a particular geographical area, ethnicity, nationality, or religion. Lineage societies are societies that limit their membership to descendants of a particular person or group of people of historical importance.

<text>José &quot;Joselito&quot; Vaca Velasco (born August 12, 1982, in Santa Cruz de la Sierra) is a Bolivian footballer. He currently plays as an attacking midfielder for Blooming in the Liga de Fútbol Profesional Boliviano (Bolivian Professional League).

==Club career==
Vaca joined Oriente Petrolero in 1999 at the age of 17, and played 33 games for the team his first year. In 2000, he was named the Best Player in the Bolivian League, as he helped lead Petrolero to a second-place finish in the league and concomitant Copa Libertadores berth.

Following the 2000 season, Vaca signed with Major League Soccer, and was selected fifth overall by the Dallas Burn in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. His second season was Vaca&#x27;s best, as he played right midfield for the Burn, and was named to the All-Star team. Vaca played a significant number of minutes in 2003.

A trade to the MetroStars for a conditional draft pick in the 2003 offseason did little to change Vaca&#x27;s performance. In four years in MLS, his numbers are average at best: just six goals and 18 assists in league play. He returned to Bolivia, signing for Blooming in 2005. After four years and one national championship with the &quot;millonarios&quot;, he decided to go back where all began, rejoining Oriente Petrolero in January 2009. In March 2012, Vaca was signed by Colombian first division side Deportivo Pasto, team which he played for the rest of that year. In January 2013 he returned to Bolivia and signed with Blooming for his second spell with the club.

==Bolivia national team==
Although Vaca was initially a hugely touted Bolivian prospect, his appearances with the Bolivia national team have cooled with his tepid performance in MLS. Since returning to Bolivia, he has been called back to the national team after years. Since 2002, Vaca has earned a total of 54 caps for Bolivia with 2 goals scored.

He was a member of the Bolivia national team in 2007 Copa América and 2011 Copa América.

<text>Gretta Duisenberg-Nieuwenhuizen (born 6 November 1942) is a Dutch pro-Palestinian political activist. She is the widow of Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) politician Wim Duisenberg, who was also the first president of the European Central Bank.

==Biography==
Gretta Duisenberg was born as Greetje Nieuwenhuizen into a strict Reformed family in Heerenveen, Friesland, where her father worked as a policeman. The family moved to Haarlem, where she grew up as a member of the Free Reformed Churches. She broke away from her religious background in the 1960s and began using the name Gretta. She started a career as a nurse and was married to internist Frits Bédier de Prairie from 1967 to 1975. They have three children.

After their divorce, she continued to bear the name of her ex-husband and went through life as Gretta Bédier de Prairie. During this period, she became active in left-wing politics and human rights causes. In the late 1970s she became involved with the Transnational Institute, an organization that advocates for the interests of the Global South and is critical of globalization. During these years she was a member of the Pacifist Socialist Party. Later she became a member of the Socialist Party.

In the early 1980s she had a brief relationship with the then Dutch Minister of Defence Hans van Mierlo. Through him she met Wim Duisenberg, who coincidentally was also born in Heerenveen. In 1987 she married Duisenberg, who was then president of De Nederlandsche Bank and from 1998 inaugural president of the European Central Bank (ECB). He died in 2005 at his holiday home in France.

==Pro-Palestinian activism==

Gretta Duisenberg came to international attention in 2002 when the media reported that the president of the ECB had a Palestinian flag hanging from his house in Amsterdam.

Gretta Duisenberg came under fire when she announced her intention of collecting six million signatures as part of her campaign to draw attention to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories. She was asked how many signatures she&#x27;d been able to gather for the petition against the occupation and replied that 6,000 supporters had signed so far. And how many signatures would you like to collect, she was asked. Duisenberg hesitated for a moment and then said, &quot;Six million&quot;. Critics stated that the figure was clearly an allusion to the number of Jewish victims of World War II. Duisenberg denied any link to the Holocaust, and stated that she just mentioned a multiple of the 6,000 they had already collected.

In a discussion program aired on Dutch TV in November 2005, she stated she understood suicide bombings in the light of the desperate conditions Palestinians are kept in. In the same program, she stated &quot;I hope Israel realizes it can&#x27;t take over the South of Amsterdam the same way it took over the West Bank!&quot; referring to the vandalism, complaints, and threats of legal action she received for hanging the Palestinian flag on her property. This statement caused controversy and further intensification of allegations of antisemitism by critics in the Netherlands. In July 2006, the Dutch Public Prosecution (&quot;Openbaar Ministerie&quot;, OM), after an investigation following a complaint by Dutch lawyer Abraham Moszkowicz, concluded there was no reason to prosecute, as the TV format of the specific programme was meant to incite fierce, possibly controversial and exaggerated reactions.

In 2010 the OM saw again no reason to prosecute Duisenberg after allegations of sedition together with members of parliament Harry van Bommel and Sadet Karabulut. This complaint was also filed by Moszkowicz. That same year, &quot;Forbes&quot; published an article about Duisenberg in which she considers being labeled as anti-semitic to be &quot;practically an honor&quot;.

In early 2014, the Dutch pro-Israel group (CIDI), together with the Dutch anti-discrimination watchdog (MDI), filed criminal charges against her in the Netherlands for an article which appeared on her pro-Palestinian website, which claimed to expose &quot;the Jewish penetration of the Internet&quot; claiming there was a Jewish conspiracy to control the Internet. The article, which is still available on her website, states that &quot;The Jews — contrary to the ‘liberal’ views they officially say they profess — in their suppressive acts practically demonstrate that they always seek to dominate the information flow, they don’t tolerate any dissent&quot;. Duisenberg subsequently denied the article was anti-Semitic and stated that she would not remove it from her website, although she added that &quot;material placed on the website does not necessarily reflect our point of view&quot;.

<text>Ravansar () is a city in the Central District of Ravansar County, Kermanshah province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

==Archaeology and history==
===Archaeology===
Ravansar has important prehistoric and historical sites, and in this respect, it has a special place in the archaeology of the west of Iran. The earliest evidence of human habitation around Ravansar extends back to the Middle Paleolithic that continues to the end of the glacial period (at least from about 50,000 years to 12,000 years ago), whose remains were found in the caves of the Kulian and Jawri, as well as the Garab River (Awi Kher). Another important discovery in the region is an elephant molar tooth that dates back to the Pleistocene era and has been discovered near Ravansar. Other important archaeological site is the Musaei mound and its two nearby smaller mounds, it has been inhabited since the end of the Neolithic period (about 8,000 years ago).
In the course of the Assyrian campaigns into Zagros, Ravansar was one of the bases of this Mesopotamian government that called Nikour, and it was used as a military base in which Assyrian soldiers gathered horses and other goods that were sent to Assyria. Stronach and Calmeyer proposed Ravansar as a possible candidate for the place of Bit-Istar, an Assyrian town and a local kingdom (c. 12th century BC - c. 710 BC) at western Zagros. The rock-cut tomb of Ravansar or Dekhmeh Rawansar, which local people call &quot;Kōshk&quot;, is located in the eastern face of limestone rock in the northeast of Ravansar, which dates back to Achaemenid period. The tomb consists of a small chamber that opens to the east and overlooks the slope. The figure of Ahura Mazda, a person, and mass of firewood appears on the right side of the entrance to this tomb. There is also a pillar base next to the Goni Khani Spring, called &quot;Takhti Zangi&quot;, which may have been created at the same time as the tomb, indicating the presence of a palace or smaller buildings near the spring. Therefore, during the Achaemenid period, Ravansar was probably one of the important centers of this government in the west of the country. In the Parthian period, Ravansar was a small town in the west of the present town which today is close to a spring called Kani Wayan (near the police station). From the Sassanid period, a collection of silverware has been discovered in Quri Qala Cave. There was also a cemetery from the Safavid period on the northern slopes of Qola Mount. The gravestones exhibiting the Kofi scripts, which unfortunately have been looted or broken in recent decades. This Safavid cemetery shows the importance of Ravansar in the Safavid period.

===Main archaeological sites===

* Musaei mounds, (from the end of the Neolithic Age - about 8,000 years ago - up to Islamic period)
* Kulian Cave and Jawri Cave (from the Middle Paleolithic Period - about 50 thousand years ago - until the end of the Epialeolithic Period - about 12 thousand years ago)
* Rock-cut tomb of &quot;Koshk&quot; (Achaemenid Period)
* Kani Wayan (the Parthian Period)
* Islamic Cemetery (Safavid Period and Qajar)

===Modern history===

Ravansar seems to have been a large village during the Safavid period. There was a cemetery from the Safavid period with tombstones with inscriptions in Kufic script on the northern slopes of Qoleh rock, which has been destroyed or looted in recent years. Ravansar was also part of the territory of Ardalan rulers during the 19th centurey. The name Ravansar was first mentioned in written sources about 400 years ago in Sharafnama, in which Ravansar is mentioned as the possessions of the Dar-Tang rulers.

Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda who was a prominent Iranian linguist and lexicographer described Ravansar in the 1960s as follows. &quot;The central town of Ravansar is part of Sanandaj, and next to the Kermanshah-Paveh highway and the southeastern promontory of Shahu Mountain. It has a cold climate, but due to numerous springs, there are many swamps and sludges in the summer. There is a clinic in the town that is always ready to receive patients. The district offices, the finance agency, the statistics, the checkpoint, the armed customs guard, and the gendarmerie are located in the town and it has one primary school and eight shops. Its main products are grains, fruits, rice, and dairy products, and there is a daily commute between this town and Kermanshah.&quot;

<text>Vaterite is a mineral, a polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It was named after the German mineralogist Heinrich Vater. It is also known as mu-calcium carbonate (μ-CaCO3). Vaterite belongs to the hexagonal crystal system, whereas calcite is trigonal and aragonite is orthorhombic.

Vaterite, like aragonite, is a metastable phase of calcium carbonate at ambient conditions at the surface of the Earth. As it is less stable than either calcite, the most stable polymorph, or aragonite, vaterite has a higher solubility than either of these phases. Therefore, once vaterite is exposed to water, it converts to calcite (at low temperature) or aragonite (at high temperature: ~60 °C). At 37 °C for example a solution-mediated transition from vaterite to calcite occurs, where the vaterite dissolves and subsequently precipitates as calcite assisted by an Ostwald ripening process.

However, vaterite does occur naturally in mineral springs, organic tissue, gallstones, urinary calculi and plants. In those circumstances, some impurities (metal ions or organic matter) may stabilize the vaterite and prevent its transformation into calcite or aragonite. Vaterite is usually colorless.

Vaterite can be produced as the first mineral deposits repairing natural or experimentally-induced shell damage in some aragonite-shelled mollusks (e.g. gastropods). Subsequent shell deposition occurs as aragonite. In 2018, vaterite was identified as a constituent of a deposit formed on the leaves of &quot;Saxifraga&quot; at Cambridge University Botanic Garden.

Vaterite is tapped as an effective intermediate form of cement whose production consumes carbon dioxide rather than emitting it. Research into the vaterite production process was inspired by its discovery in the hard skeletons of coral.

Vaterite has a JCPDS number of .

<doc id="1123876" wikidata="Q6274879" url="?curid=1123876" title="Revolver (The Haunted album)">
<text>Revolver (stylized as rEVOLVEr) is the fourth studio album by Swedish metal band the Haunted. It was released on 18 October 2004.

After having been absent for the previous two studio albums, Peter Dolving was once again back in the band and provided the vocals for &quot;rEVOLVEr&quot;. He would remain with the band until he left once again in 2012.

As the title on the album indicates with its stylized typography (i.e. with the word &quot;EVOLVE&quot; printed in upper case letters between the two lower case r&#x27;s), the band made a conscious decision to tweak (or &quot;evolve&quot;) its songwriting on this album. As a result, rEVOLVEr contains some elements that were absent on previous The Haunted albums. Although the album still contains examples of the band&#x27;s familiar thrash metal sound (e.g. &quot;No Compromise&quot;, &quot;Sabotage&quot;, &quot;Sweet Relief&quot;), it features considerably more mid-paced riffing (e.g. &quot;99&quot;, &quot;Burnt to a Shell&quot;, &quot;Fire Alive&quot;) than in any of their previous albums. Two of the tracks even have ballad elements interspersed in them (&quot;Abysmal&quot; and &quot;My Shadow&quot;).
Also notable is that rEVOLVEr has quite a few instances of clean singing in it, although the vast majority of the vocal tracking was still done in The Haunted&#x27;s traditional hardcore/metalcore style of screaming.

A limited edition digipak of this CD contained two bonus tracks, and different artwork.

A music video was made for &quot;No Compromise&quot; which featured Barney Greenway.

== Track listing ==


:*The limited edition of the album contains the bonus tracks &quot;Fire Alive&quot; and &quot;Smut King&quot; at tracks 11 and 12, respectively. &quot;My Shadow&quot; was moved to track 13.

:*The Japanese release contains the bonus track &quot;Out of Reach&quot; at track 9, respectively. &quot;Nothing Right&quot; was moved to track 10. The bonus track &quot;Smut King&quot; is not on this edition. However, &quot;Fire Alive&quot; still remains at track 11, therefore keeping the album at 13 tracks.

<doc id="1123879" wikidata="Q4889050" url="?curid=1123879" title="Benjamin Musaphia">
<text>Benjamin ben Immanuel Musaphia (c. 1606 – 1675), also called Benjamin Musaphia or Mussafia and Dionysius, was a Jewish doctor, scholar and kabbalist.

Musaphia was probably born in Spain. He married Sara Abigail da Silva, daughter of Semuel da Silva, in 1628. Their sons and grandsons joined the court of the Gottorps, and a daughter was married to Gabriel Milan, who would later be appointed governor of the Danish West Indies (now the United States Virgin Islands). Around this time, Musaphia graduated from the University of Padua medical school, which was regarded as the best of its kind at the time.

== Publications ==
After Sara&#x27;s death on 7 August 1634, Musaphia dedicated &quot;Zekher Rav&quot;, an adaptation of the creation myth in which all Hebrew word roots are used exactly once, to her. It was first published in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1635, and a second edition with a Latin translation was published in Hamburg in 1638.

Another work was published in 1640, namely &quot;Sacro-Medicæ Sententiæ ex Bibliis&quot;, a medical treatise containing about 800 sentences on medicine. It contained a section on alchemy that created some stirring at the time. Musaphia also dedicated a work on ebb and flow to Christian IV of Denmark in 1642.

== Career ==
In 1646, while living in Glückstadt, Holstein, Musaphia was appointed royal physician to the Danish court by Christian IV.

Around 1648, probably in connection with the death of Christian IV, Musaphia went to Amsterdam and joined the college of rabbis. In 1655, he published an extended version of Nathan ben Jehiels Talmudic dictionary &quot;Aruk&quot; (ca. 1100), titled &quot;Musaf he-&#x27;Aruk&quot;, detailing many Jewish customs. The preface states that he had been collecting this information since a young boy. Musaphia was also working on a revised version of the Talmud, which was nevertheless never published, and the manuscripts have since been lost.

== Personal life and family ==
In the mid-1660s, Musaphia was caught up in the Sabbataean movement, which proclaimed that Sabbatai Zevi was the living Messiah.

His brother Albert Dionis was one of the wealthiest Jews in Hamburg in 1614.

Musaphia died in 1675, in Amsterdam.

<text>Boston Guildhall is a former municipal building in Boston, Lincolnshire. Built in 1390 and altered through the centuries, in the early 21st century it was restored and now serves as a local museum and also as a venue for civil ceremonies and private functions. It is a Grade I listed building.

==History==

St. Mary&#x27;s Guild in Boston was founded as a merchant guild by a group of individuals in 1260. The guildhall, based on evidence from dendrochronology, was built in 1390, two years before incorporation of the guild and probably in anticipation of that event. The guild became wealthy as a result of extensive gifts received in the 14th and 15th centuries; an inventory shows that it held various items of gold, silver and gilt, as well as the sacred relics. In the 16th century, it established one of the country&#x27;s richest trades in indulgences (in direct competition with Austin Friars). As a result of the dissolution of the chantries and religious guilds, imposed by King Edward VI, the guildhall was confiscated by the Crown and passed to the Boston Corporation in 1555.

In autumn 1607 a group of Puritans led by William Brewster, now known as the Pilgrim Fathers, were brought before the magistrates in the guildhall, accused of seeking to travel to Holland without the King&#x27;s permission (which was required). They were discharged by the magistrates and lived in Boston for several months before reaching Holland the following year by another route; they later sailed from Plymouth in the Mayflower for the New World in 1620, settling in what became the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

As the building was increasingly used for civic purposes in the 18th century, ongoing changes were put in place which removed or masked much of the building&#x27;s medieval fabric. Pishey Thompson, writing in 1856, claimed that &quot;the interior of the building is so completely modernised that nothing of the original but the construction of the roof is visible&quot;. After the new Sessions House in Church Close was completed in 1842, the guildhall ceased to be used as a place for the administration of justice. After the new Municipal Buildings in West Street were completed in 1904, the guildhall ceased to have any municipal role.

The guildhall operated a restaurant which served as a National Soup Kitchen in the First World War and as a British Restaurant in the Second World War but was forced to close after an outbreak of food poisoning in 1949. The whole building was restored after receiving £1 million in support from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2008.

==Architecture==
The walls consist of two faces of brickwork between which is a rubble core matrix. The bonding of the brickwork is characteristic of a late medieval date. Irregular shaped bricks are laid in a fairly thick mortar and in a haphazard bond consisting largely of rows of stretchers with the occasional header used to bond the two wall surfaces together. This construction pre-dated the widespread adoption of English Bond (alternating courses of headers and stretchers) and Flemish bond (alternating headers and stretchers in each course) in England. The courses of brickwork are bonded together with a lime-based &#x27;common mortar&#x27; which was originally pointed back flush with the wall face. It survives on the bedding planes and is exposed in several places on the north elevation.

==Guildhall collection==
Works of art include a portrait, painted by Thomas Phillips, of Sir Joseph Banks, recorder of Boston in 1813, who sailed with Captain James Cook aboard the &quot;Endeavour&quot; on the first great voyage to discover Australia. The guildhall also holds a copy of &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot; and artefacts from various archaeological excavations.

<text>The Vendée (, ; ) is a river in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Pays de la Loire regions in western France. It a right tributary of the Sèvre Niortaise.

Its source is near L&#x27;Absie, in the west of the Deux-Sèvres department. For a few kilometres, it forms the border between the departments of Vendée (named after the river) and Charente-Maritime, before it flows into the Sèvre Niortaise, near Marans.

The name is attested as &quot;Fluvium Vendre&quot; in the 10th century, and as &quot;Flumen Vendee&quot; and &quot;Vendeia&quot; by the 11th century. According to Pierre-Henri Billy, the name ultimately derives from the Celtic toponym &quot;*vindo-&quot; meaning white or brilliant in a sacred context (as in the Modern Welsh &quot;gwyn/wyn&quot;). The name likely originates in Proto-Celtic or Gaulish, but may also have originated in the Gallo or Old Breton languages.

It flows through the following departments and towns:

*Deux-Sèvres: Saint-Paul-en-Gâtine 
*Vendée: Mervent, Fontenay-le-Comte, Velluire, L&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Elle
*Charente-Maritime

<text>Dangerous Journeys was a roleplaying game created by Gary Gygax, the cocreator of the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; system. The game was originally announced as &quot;Dangerous Dimensions&quot; but was changed to &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; in response to a threat of a lawsuit from TSR, Inc., the publishers of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;, and the company Gygax had cofounded, over objections that the &quot;DD&quot; abbreviation would be too similar to &quot;D&amp;D.&quot;

Created after his departure from TSR, the publication of this series of books by Game Designers&#x27; Workshop was met with lawsuits by TSR, which ultimately saw the production of the game system cease.

The design of the game system addressed many of the perceived flaws and limitations of the older AD&amp;D game system, such as a lack of a skill system and rigid, class-based restrictions on weapons. According to a FAQ on the official Gary Gygax website, the &quot;Mythus Fantasy&quot; setting for &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; was one of several settings planned for the system.

Several books were produced for the line:
*&quot;Mythus&quot;, the core rulebook
*&quot;Mythus Magick&quot;, a compendium of spells and magick items
*&quot;The Epic of Aerth&quot;, a campaign world book
*&quot;Necropolis and the Land of Aegypt&quot;, a setting book and adventure module
*&quot;Mythus Bestiary&quot; - a book of creature and monster statistics, concentrating on animals and beasts both mundane and weird
*&quot;Mythus Game Master&#x27;s Screen&quot;, a GM screen and book of charts
*&quot;Mythus Prime&quot;, a simplified and streamlined version of the Mythus rules

At least one additional game in the &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; series was planned but never published:
*&quot;Unhallowed&quot;, a game of supernatural horror
*&quot;The City of Ascalon&quot;, a second setting book was advertised. Ascalon was later published as a standalone RPG product in 2023 by FGG Games, LLC.

Electronic Arts began to develop a video game version, but it was never completed.

<text>Blake Warren Bashoff (born May 30, 1981) is an American television and motion picture actor, known for his role as Moritz Stiefel in &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;. He has also appeared in a number of guest roles on television series, including the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; as Karl Martin.

== Early life ==
Bashoff was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Irene (Zalcman) and Kenneth &quot;Ken&quot; Bashoff. His family is Jewish. Bashoff started acting at the age of 10, working primarily in commercials, and then singing and dancing in film and theater. He moved to Hollywood after graduating from George Washington High School in 1999.

== Career ==
Bashoff had a role in the CW hit show &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; in its first season. He also appeared in &quot;Bushwhacked&quot;, &quot;Big Bully&quot; (for which he won a Young Artist Award), and &quot;The New Swiss Family Robinson&quot; in 1998. After taking a break from acting, he received a recurring role on &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, playing the character of Eric Black, an abused gay teenager. In 2000, he played the role of Jesse in &quot;You&#x27;re Invited to Mary-Kate and Ashley&#x27;s School Dance Party&quot;. He has since appeared in &quot;Deuces Wild&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot;, and has a minor recurring role in One Tree Hill. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;The Bare Witch Project&quot;, as Duncan, a young man who accidentally conjured Lady Godiva. He played the role of Josh Cooper, a victim&#x27;s son, in the seventh episode of season four of the series &quot;NCIS&quot;. In October 2006, he landed a recurring role as Karl in the television series &quot;Lost&quot;, both in the third and fourth season.

On December 18, 2007, Bashoff made his Broadway debut in the role of Moritz Stiefel in the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, replacing John Gallagher Jr. His last Broadway performance was on August 2, 2008. He was replaced on Broadway by former ensemble member and Moritz understudy Gerard Canonico. Bashoff reprised his role as Moritz on the first national tour of &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;. He ended his run with the &quot;Spring Awakening&quot; national touring cast on August 16, 2009, and was replaced by Taylor Trensch.

Bashoff also appears in the 2008 film &quot;Together Again for the First Time&quot;, which stars David Ogden Stiers and Julia Duffy. He played Mark, Peggy Olson&#x27;s boyfriend, on season four of &quot;Mad Men&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Mostly retired from acting, Mire now lives on a farm with his husband.

<doc id="1123899" wikidata="Q16978603" url="?curid=1123899" title="Independence constitution">
<text>[[Independence]] constitution is the name commonly given by African political scientists to originating constitutions (many of which are extant) of former British colonies, primarily in Africa, which gained their independence approximately 1960-1990. 

Due to these colonies&#x27; low economic output and the United Kingdom&#x27;s fading imperial prowess, independence was usually granted after little instigation, with the UK presiding over creation of the new state. Generally local leaders were hand-picked by the UK to be the new governing body and were given a political education in London, during which they often served as the sole representative of their country in the negotiation of their country&#x27;s new constitution. In short, independence constitutions were written in London, by a primarily British body, in line with British systems of governance. Supporters applaud the UK&#x27;s responsible transfer of power; critics cite low popular perceptions of legitimacy and claim that the independence constitutions maintained essentially colonial states.

<doc id="1123902" wikidata="Q851162" url="?curid=1123902" title="Biosynthesis">
<text>Biosynthesis, i.e., chemical synthesis occurring in biological contexts, is a term most often referring to multi-step, enzyme-catalyzed processes where chemical substances absorbed as nutrients (or previously converted through biosynthesis) serve as enzyme substrates, with conversion by the living organism either into simpler or more complex products. Examples of biosynthetic pathways include those for the production of amino acids, lipid membrane components, and nucleotides, but also for the production of all classes of biological macromolecules, and of acetyl-coenzyme A, adenosine triphosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and other key intermediate and transactional molecules needed for metabolism. Thus, in biosynthesis, any of an array of compounds, from simple to complex, are converted into other compounds, and so it includes both the catabolism and anabolism (building up and breaking down) of complex molecules (including macromolecules). Biosynthetic processes are often represented via charts of metabolic pathways. A particular biosynthetic pathway may be located within a single cellular organelle (e.g., mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathways), while others involve enzymes that are located across an array of cellular organelles and structures (e.g., the biosynthesis of glycosylated cell surface proteins). 

==Elements of biosynthesis==

Elements of biosynthesis include: precursor compounds, chemical energy (e.g. ATP), and catalytic enzymes which may need coenzymes (e.g. NADH, NADPH). These elements create monomers, the building blocks for macromolecules. Some important biological macromolecules include: proteins, which are composed of amino acid monomers joined via peptide bonds, and DNA molecules, which are composed of nucleotides joined via phosphodiester bonds.

==Properties of chemical reactions==
Biosynthesis occurs due to a series of chemical reactions. For these reactions to take place, the following elements are necessary:

* Precursor compounds: these compounds are the starting molecules or substrates in a reaction. These may also be viewed as the reactants in a given chemical process.
* Chemical energy: chemical energy can be found in the form of high energy molecules. These molecules are required for energetically unfavourable reactions. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of these compounds drives a reaction forward. High energy molecules, such as ATP, have three phosphates. Often, the terminal phosphate is split off during hydrolysis and transferred to another molecule. 
* Catalysts: these may be for example metal ions or coenzymes and they catalyze a reaction by increasing the rate of the reaction and lowering the activation energy.

In the simplest sense, the reactions that occur in biosynthesis have the following format:

::&lt;chem&gt; Reactant -&gt;[][enzyme] Product &lt;/chem&gt;

Some variations of this basic equation which will be discussed later in more detail are:

# Simple compounds which are converted into other compounds, usually as part of a multiple step reaction pathway. Two examples of this type of reaction occur during the formation of nucleic acids and the charging of tRNA prior to translation. For some of these steps, chemical energy is required:
#::&lt;chem&gt; {Precursor~molecule} + ATP &lt;=&gt; {product~AMP} + PP_i&lt;/chem&gt;
# Simple compounds that are converted into other compounds with the assistance of cofactors. For example, the synthesis of phospholipids requires acetyl CoA, while the synthesis of another membrane component, sphingolipids, requires NADH and FADH for the formation the sphingosine backbone. The general equation for these examples is:
#::&lt;chem&gt; {Precursor~molecule} + Cofactor -&gt;[][enzyme] macromolecule &lt;/chem&gt;
# Simple compounds that join to create a macromolecule. For example, fatty acids join to form phospholipids. In turn, phospholipids and cholesterol interact noncovalently in order to form the lipid bilayer. This reaction may be depicted as follows:
#::&lt;chem&gt; {Molecule~1} + Molecule~2 -&gt; macromolecule &lt;/chem&gt;

==Lipid==

Many intricate macromolecules are synthesized in a pattern of simple, repeated structures. For example, the simplest structures of lipids are fatty acids. Fatty acids are hydrocarbon derivatives; they contain a carboxyl group &quot;head&quot; and a hydrocarbon chain &quot;tail&quot;. These fatty acids create larger components, which in turn incorporate noncovalent interactions to form the lipid bilayer.
Fatty acid chains are found in two major components of membrane lipids: phospholipids and sphingolipids. A third major membrane component, cholesterol, does not contain these fatty acid units.

===Eukaryotic phospholipids===

The foundation of all biomembranes consists of a bilayer structure of phospholipids. The phospholipid molecule is amphipathic; it contains a hydrophilic polar head and a hydrophobic nonpolar tail. The phospholipid heads interact with each other and aqueous media, while the hydrocarbon tails orient themselves in the center, away from water. These latter interactions drive the bilayer structure that acts as a barrier for ions and molecules.

There are various types of phospholipids; consequently, their synthesis pathways differ. However, the first step in phospholipid synthesis involves the formation of phosphatidate or diacylglycerol 3-phosphate at the endoplasmic reticulum and outer mitochondrial membrane. The synthesis pathway is found below:

The pathway starts with glycerol 3-phosphate, which gets converted to lysophosphatidate via the addition of a fatty acid chain provided by acyl coenzyme A. Then, lysophosphatidate is converted to phosphatidate via the addition of another fatty acid chain contributed by a second acyl CoA; all of these steps are catalyzed by the glycerol phosphate acyltransferase enzyme. Phospholipid synthesis continues in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the biosynthesis pathway diverges depending on the components of the particular phospholipid.

===Sphingolipids===
Like phospholipids, these fatty acid derivatives have a polar head and nonpolar tails. Unlike phospholipids, sphingolipids have a sphingosine backbone. Sphingolipids exist in eukaryotic cells and are particularly abundant in the central nervous system. For example, sphingomyelin is part of the myelin sheath of nerve fibers.

Sphingolipids are formed from ceramides that consist of a fatty acid chain attached to the amino group of a sphingosine backbone. These ceramides are synthesized from the acylation of sphingosine. The biosynthetic pathway for sphingosine is found below:

As the image denotes, during sphingosine synthesis, palmitoyl CoA and serine undergo a condensation reaction which results in the formation of 3-dehydrosphinganine. This product is then reduced to form dihydrospingosine, which is converted to sphingosine via the oxidation reaction by FAD.

===Cholesterol===
This lipid belongs to a class of molecules called sterols. Sterols have four fused rings and a hydroxyl group. Cholesterol is a particularly important molecule. Not only does it serve as a component of lipid membranes, it is also a precursor to several steroid hormones, including cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen.

Cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl CoA. The pathway is shown below:

More generally, this synthesis occurs in three stages, with the first stage taking place in the cytoplasm and the second and third stages occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum. The stages are as follows:

::1. The synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate, the &quot;building block&quot; of cholesterol

::2. The formation of squalene via the condensation of six molecules of isopentenyl phosphate

::3. The conversion of squalene into cholesterol via several enzymatic reactions

==Nucleotides==

The biosynthesis of nucleotides involves enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert substrates into more complex products. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Nucleotides are composed of a five-membered ring formed from ribose sugar in RNA, and deoxyribose sugar in DNA; these sugars are linked to a purine or pyrimidine base with a glycosidic bond and a phosphate group at the 5&#x27; location of the sugar.

===Purine nucleotides===

The DNA nucleotides adenosine and guanosine consist of a purine base attached to a ribose sugar with a glycosidic bond. In the case of RNA nucleotides deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine, the purine bases are attached to a deoxyribose sugar with a glycosidic bond. The purine bases on DNA and RNA nucleotides are synthesized in a twelve-step reaction mechanism present in most single-celled organisms. Higher eukaryotes employ a similar reaction mechanism in ten reaction steps. Purine bases are synthesized by converting phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), which is the first key intermediate in purine base biosynthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kappock/Purine&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Further enzymatic modification of IMP produces the adenosine and guanosine bases of nucleotides.

# The first step in purine biosynthesis is a condensation reaction, performed by glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase. This enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamine to PRPP, forming 5-phosphoribosylamine. The following step requires the activation of glycine by the addition of a phosphate group from ATP.
# GAR synthetase performs the condensation of activated glycine onto PRPP, forming glycineamide ribonucleotide (GAR).
# GAR transformylase adds a formyl group onto the amino group of GAR, forming formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR).
# FGAR amidotransferase catalyzes the addition of a nitrogen group to FGAR, forming formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM).
# FGAM cyclase catalyzes ring closure, which involves removal of a water molecule, forming the 5-membered imidazole ring 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR).
# N5-CAIR synthetase transfers a carboxyl group, forming the intermediate N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (N5-CAIR).
# N5-CAIR mutase rearranges the carboxyl functional group and transfers it onto the imidazole ring, forming carboxyamino- imidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR). The two step mechanism of CAIR formation from AIR is mostly found in single celled organisms. Higher eukaryotes contain the enzyme AIR carboxylase, which transfers a carboxyl group directly to AIR imidazole ring, forming CAIR.
# SAICAR synthetase forms a peptide bond between aspartate and the added carboxyl group of the imidazole ring, forming N-succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (SAICAR).
# SAICAR lyase removes the carbon skeleton of the added aspartate, leaving the amino group and forming 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). 
# AICAR transformylase transfers a carbonyl group to AICAR, forming N-formylaminoimidazole- 4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (FAICAR).
# The final step involves the enzyme IMP synthase, which performs the purine ring closure and forms the inosine monophosphate intermediate.

===Pyrimidine nucleotides===

Other DNA and RNA nucleotide bases that are linked to the ribose sugar via a glycosidic bond are thymine, cytosine and uracil (which is only found in RNA).
Uridine monophosphate biosynthesis involves an enzyme that is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and multifunctional enzymes that are located in the cytosol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Srere/Metabolic enzymes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
# The first step involves the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase combining glutamine with CO2 in an ATP dependent reaction to form carbamoyl phosphate.
# Aspartate carbamoyltransferase condenses carbamoyl phosphate with aspartate to form uridosuccinate.
# Dihydroorotase performs ring closure, a reaction that loses water, to form dihydroorotate.
# Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, located within the mitochondrial inner membrane, oxidizes dihydroorotate to orotate.
# Orotate phosphoribosyl hydrolase (OMP pyrophosphorylase) condenses orotate with PRPP to form orotidine-5&#x27;-phosphate.
# OMP decarboxylase catalyzes the conversion of orotidine-5&#x27;-phosphate to UMP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broach/Yeast nucleotide&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the uridine nucleotide base is synthesized, the other bases, cytosine and thymine are synthesized. Cytosine biosynthesis is a two-step reaction which involves the conversion of UMP to UTP. Phosphate addition to UMP is catalyzed by a kinase enzyme. The enzyme CTP synthase catalyzes the next reaction step: the conversion of UTP to CTP by transferring an amino group from glutamine to uridine; this forms the cytosine base of CTP.&lt;ref name=&quot;O&#x27;Donovan/ pyrimidine microorg&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism, which depicts the reaction UTP + ATP + glutamine ⇔ CTP + ADP + glutamate, is below:


Cytosine is a nucleotide that is present in both DNA and RNA. However, uracil is only found in RNA. Therefore, after UTP is synthesized, it is must be converted into a deoxy form to be incorporated into DNA. This conversion involves the enzyme ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase. This reaction that removes the 2&#x27;-OH of the ribose sugar to generate deoxyribose is not affected by the bases attached to the sugar. This non-specificity allows ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase to convert all nucleotide triphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide by a similar mechanism.

In contrast to uracil, thymine bases are found mostly in DNA, not RNA. Cells do not normally contain thymine bases that are linked to ribose sugars in RNA, thus indicating that cells only synthesize deoxyribose-linked thymine. The enzyme thymidylate synthetase is responsible for synthesizing thymine residues from dUMP to dTMP. This reaction transfers a methyl group onto the uracil base of dUMP to generate dTMP. The thymidylate synthase reaction, dUMP + 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate ⇔ dTMP + dihydrofolate, is shown to the right.
==DNA==

Although there are differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA synthesis, the following section denotes key characteristics of DNA replication shared by both organisms.

DNA is composed of nucleotides that are joined by phosphodiester bonds. DNA synthesis, which takes place in the nucleus, is a semiconservative process, which means that the resulting DNA molecule contains an original strand from the parent structure and a new strand. DNA synthesis is catalyzed by a family of DNA polymerases that require four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, a template strand, and a primer with a free 3&#x27;OH in which to incorporate nucleotides.

In order for DNA replication to occur, a replication fork is created by enzymes called helicases which unwind the DNA helix. Topoisomerases at the replication fork remove supercoils caused by DNA unwinding, and single-stranded DNA binding proteins maintain the two single-stranded DNA templates stabilized prior to replication.

DNA synthesis is initiated by the RNA polymerase primase, which makes an RNA primer with a free 3&#x27;OH. This primer is attached to the single-stranded DNA template, and DNA polymerase elongates the chain by incorporating nucleotides; DNA polymerase also proofreads the newly synthesized DNA strand.

During the polymerization reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerase, a nucleophilic attack occurs by the 3&#x27;OH of the growing chain on the innermost phosphorus atom of a deoxynucleoside triphosphate; this yields the formation of a phosphodiester bridge that attaches a new nucleotide and releases pyrophosphate.

Two types of strands are created simultaneously during replication: the leading strand, which is synthesized continuously and grows towards the replication fork, and the lagging strand, which is made discontinuously in Okazaki fragments and grows away from the replication fork. Okazaki fragments are covalently joined by DNA ligase to form a continuous strand.
Then, to complete DNA replication, RNA primers are removed, and the resulting gaps are replaced with DNA and joined via DNA ligase.
==Amino acids==

A protein is a polymer that is composed from amino acids that are linked by peptide bonds. There are more than 300 amino acids found in nature of which only twenty two, known as the proteinogenic amino acids, are the building blocks for protein. Only green plants and most microbes are able to synthesize all of the 20 standard amino acids that are needed by all living species. Mammals can only synthesize ten of the twenty standard amino acids. The other amino acids, valine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan for adults and histidine, and arginine for babies are obtained through diet.

===Amino acid basic structure===

The general structure of the standard amino acids includes a primary amino group, a carboxyl group and the functional group attached to the α-carbon. The different amino acids are identified by the functional group. As a result of the three different groups attached to the α-carbon, amino acids are asymmetrical molecules. For all standard amino acids, except glycine, the α-carbon is a chiral center. In the case of glycine, the α-carbon has two hydrogen atoms, thus adding symmetry to this molecule. With the exception of proline, all of the amino acids found in life have the L-isoform conformation. Proline has a functional group on the α-carbon that forms a ring with the amino group.

===Nitrogen source===

One major step in amino acid biosynthesis involves incorporating a nitrogen group onto the α-carbon. In cells, there are two major pathways of incorporating nitrogen groups. One pathway involves the enzyme glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) which removes the amide amino group of glutamine and transfers it onto 2-oxoglutarate, producing two glutamate molecules. In this catalysis reaction, glutamine serves as the nitrogen source. An image illustrating this reaction is found to the right.

The other pathway for incorporating nitrogen onto the α-carbon of amino acids involves the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). GDH is able to transfer ammonia onto 2-oxoglutarate and form glutamate. Furthermore, the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) is able to transfer ammonia onto glutamate and synthesize glutamine, replenishing glutamine.

===The glutamate family of amino acids===

The glutamate family of amino acids includes the amino acids that derive from the amino acid glutamate. This family includes: glutamate, glutamine, proline, and arginine. This family also includes the amino acid lysine, which is derived from α-ketoglutarate.

The biosynthesis of glutamate and glutamine is a key step in the nitrogen assimilation discussed above. The enzymes GOGAT and GDH catalyze the nitrogen assimilation reactions.

In bacteria, the enzyme glutamate 5-kinase initiates the biosynthesis of proline by transferring a phosphate group from ATP onto glutamate. The next reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), which catalyzes the reduction of the ϒ-carboxyl group of L-glutamate 5-phosphate. This results in the formation of glutamate semialdehyde, which spontaneously cyclizes to pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate is further reduced by the enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) to yield a proline amino acid.

In the first step of arginine biosynthesis in bacteria, glutamate is acetylated by transferring the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA at the N-α position; this prevents spontaneous cyclization. The enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase (glutamate N-acetyltransferase) is responsible for catalyzing the acetylation step. Subsequent steps are catalyzed by the enzymes N-acetylglutamate kinase, N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase, and acetylornithine/succinyldiamino pimelate aminotransferase and yield the N-acetyl-L-ornithine. The acetyl group of acetylornithine is removed by the enzyme acetylornithinase (AO) or ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT), and this yields ornithine. Then, the enzymes citrulline and argininosuccinate convert ornithine to arginine.

There are two distinct lysine biosynthetic pathways: the diaminopimelic acid pathway and the α-aminoadipate pathway. The most common of the two synthetic pathways is the diaminopimelic acid pathway; it consists of several enzymatic reactions that add carbon groups to aspartate to yield lysine:

# Aspartate kinase initiates the diaminopimelic acid pathway by phosphorylating aspartate and producing aspartyl phosphate.
# Aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of aspartyl phosphate to yield aspartate semialdehyde.
# 4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate synthase adds a pyruvate group to the β-aspartyl-4-semialdehyde, and a water molecule is removed. This causes cyclization and gives rise to (2S,4S)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate.
# 4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate reductase catalyzes the reduction of (2S,4S)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate by NADPH to yield Δ&#x27;-piperideine-2,6-dicarboxylate (2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate) and H2O.
# Tetrahydrodipicolinate acyltransferase catalyzes the acetylation reaction that results in ring opening and yields N-acetyl α-amino-ε-ketopimelate.
# N-succinyl-α-amino-ε-ketopimelate-glutamate aminotransaminase catalyzes the transamination reaction that removes the keto group of N-acetyl α-amino-ε-ketopimelate and replaces it with an amino group to yield N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelate.
# N-acyldiaminopimelate deacylase catalyzes the deacylation of N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelate to yield L,L-diaminopimelate.
# DAP epimerase catalyzes the conversion of L,L-diaminopimelate to the meso form of L,L-diaminopimelate.
# DAP decarboxylase catalyzes the removal of the carboxyl group, yielding L-lysine.

===The serine family of amino acids===

The serine family of amino acid includes: serine, cysteine, and glycine. Most microorganisms and plants obtain the sulfur for synthesizing methionine from the amino acid cysteine. Furthermore, the conversion of serine to glycine provides the carbons needed for the biosynthesis of the methionine and histidine.

During serine biosynthesis, the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase catalyzes the initial reaction that oxidizes 3-phospho-D-glycerate to yield 3-phosphonooxypyruvate. The following reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoserine aminotransferase, which transfers an amino group from glutamate onto 3-phosphonooxypyruvate to yield L-phosphoserine. The final step is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoserine phosphatase, which dephosphorylates L-phosphoserine to yield L-serine.

There are two known pathways for the biosynthesis of glycine. Organisms that use ethanol and acetate as the major carbon source utilize the glyconeogenic pathway to synthesize glycine. The other pathway of glycine biosynthesis is known as the glycolytic pathway. This pathway converts serine synthesized from the intermediates of glycolysis to glycine. In the glycolytic pathway, the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyzes the cleavage of serine to yield glycine and transfers the cleaved carbon group of serine onto tetrahydrofolate, forming 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate.

Cysteine biosynthesis is a two-step reaction that involves the incorporation of inorganic sulfur. In microorganisms and plants, the enzyme serine acetyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of acetyl group from acetyl-CoA onto L-serine to yield O-acetyl-L-serine. The following reaction step, catalyzed by the enzyme O-acetyl serine (thiol) lyase, replaces the acetyl group of O-acetyl-L-serine with sulfide to yield cysteine.

===The aspartate family of amino acids===

The aspartate family of amino acids includes: threonine, lysine, methionine, isoleucine, and aspartate. Lysine and isoleucine are considered part of the aspartate family even though part of their carbon skeleton is derived from pyruvate. In the case of methionine, the methyl carbon is derived from serine and the sulfur group, but in most organisms, it is derived from cysteine.

The biosynthesis of aspartate is a one step reaction that is catalyzed by a single enzyme. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from aspartate onto α-ketoglutarate to yield glutamate and oxaloacetate. Asparagine is synthesized by an ATP-dependent addition of an amino group onto aspartate; asparagine synthetase catalyzes the addition of nitrogen from glutamine or soluble ammonia to aspartate to yield asparagine. 

The diaminopimelic acid biosynthetic pathway of lysine belongs to the aspartate family of amino acids. This pathway involves nine enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert aspartate to lysine.

# Aspartate kinase catalyzes the initial step in the diaminopimelic acid pathway by transferring a phosphoryl from ATP onto the carboxylate group of aspartate, which yields aspartyl-β-phosphate.
# Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase catalyzes the reduction reaction by dephosphorylation of aspartyl-β-phosphate to yield aspartate-β-semialdehyde.
# Dihydrodipicolinate synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction of aspartate-β-semialdehyde with pyruvate to yield dihydrodipicolinic acid. 
# 4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate reductase catalyzes the reduction of dihydrodipicolinic acid to yield tetrahydrodipicolinic acid. 
# Tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a succinyl group from succinyl-CoA on to tetrahydrodipicolinic acid to yield N-succinyl-L-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate.
# N-succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from glutamate onto N-succinyl-L-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate to yield N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid.
# Succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase catalyzes the removal of acyl group from N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid to yield L,L-diaminopimelic acid.
# Diaminopimelate epimerase catalyzes the inversion of the α-carbon of L,L-diaminopimelic acid to yield meso-diaminopimelic acid.
# Siaminopimelate decarboxylase catalyzes the final step in lysine biosynthesis that removes the carbon dioxide group from meso-diaminopimelic acid to yield L-lysine.
==Proteins==
Protein synthesis occurs via a process called translation. During translation, genetic material called mRNA is read by ribosomes to generate a protein polypeptide chain. This process requires transfer RNA (tRNA) which serves as an adaptor by binding amino acids on one end and interacting with mRNA at the other end; the latter pairing between the tRNA and mRNA ensures that the correct amino acid is added to the chain. Protein synthesis occurs in three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Prokaryotic (archaeal and bacterial) translation differs from eukaryotic translation; however, this section will mostly focus on the commonalities between the two organisms.

===Additional background===

Before translation can begin, the process of binding a specific amino acid to its corresponding tRNA must occur. This reaction, called tRNA charging, is catalyzed by aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. A specific tRNA synthetase is responsible for recognizing and charging a particular amino acid. Furthermore, this enzyme has special discriminator regions to ensure the correct binding between tRNA and its cognate amino acid. The first step for joining an amino acid to its corresponding tRNA is the formation of aminoacyl-AMP:

:&lt;chem&gt; {Amino~acid} + ATP &lt;=&gt; {aminoacyl-AMP} + PP_i&lt;/chem&gt;

This is followed by the transfer of the aminoacyl group from aminoacyl-AMP to a tRNA molecule. The resulting molecule is aminoacyl-tRNA:

:&lt;chem&gt; {Aminoacyl-AMP} + tRNA &lt;=&gt; {aminoacyl-tRNA} + AMP&lt;/chem&gt;

The combination of these two steps, both of which are catalyzed by aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, produces a charged tRNA that is ready to add amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain.

In addition to binding an amino acid, tRNA has a three nucleotide unit called an anticodon that base pairs with specific nucleotide triplets on the mRNA called codons; codons encode a specific amino acid. This interaction is possible thanks to the ribosome, which serves as the site for protein synthesis. The ribosome possesses three tRNA binding sites: the aminoacyl site (A site), the peptidyl site (P site), and the exit site (E site).

There are numerous codons within an mRNA transcript, and it is very common for an amino acid to be specified by more than one codon; this phenomenon is called degeneracy. In all, there are 64 codons, 61 of each code for one of the 20 amino acids, while the remaining codons specify chain termination.

===Translation in steps===
As previously mentioned, translation occurs in three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. 
====Step 1: Initiation====

The completion of the initiation phase is dependent on the following three events:

1. The recruitment of the ribosome to mRNA

2. The binding of a charged initiator tRNA into the P site of the ribosome

3. The proper alignment of the ribosome with mRNA&#x27;s start codon

====Step 2: Elongation====

Following initiation, the polypeptide chain is extended via anticodon:codon interactions, with the ribosome adding amino acids to the polypeptide chain one at a time. The following steps must occur to ensure the correct addition of amino acids:

1. The binding of the correct tRNA into the A site of the ribosome

2. The formation of a peptide bond between the tRNA in the A site and the polypeptide chain attached to the tRNA in the P site

3. Translocation or advancement of the tRNA-mRNA complex by three nucleotides

Translocation &quot;kicks off&quot; the tRNA at the E site and shifts the tRNA from the A site into the P site, leaving the A site free for an incoming tRNA to add another amino acid.

====Step 3: Termination====

The last stage of translation occurs when a stop codon enters the A site. Then, the following steps occur:

1. The recognition of codons by release factors, which causes the hydrolysis of the polypeptide chain from the tRNA located in the P site
2. The release of the polypeptide chain

3. The dissociation and &quot;recycling&quot; of the ribosome for future translation processes

A summary table of the key players in translation is found below:


==Diseases associated with macromolecule deficiency==

Errors in biosynthetic pathways can have deleterious consequences including the malformation of macromolecules or the underproduction of functional molecules. Below are examples that illustrate the disruptions that occur due to these inefficiencies.

*Familial hypercholesterolemia: this disorder is characterized by the absence of functional receptors for LDL. Deficiencies in the formation of LDL receptors may cause faulty receptors which disrupt the endocytic pathway, inhibiting the entry of LDL into the liver and other cells. This causes a buildup of LDL in the blood plasma, which results in atherosclerotic plaques that narrow arteries and increase the risk of heart attacks.
*Lesch–Nyhan syndrome: this genetic disease is characterized by self- mutilation, mental deficiency, and gout. It is caused by the absence of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which is a necessary enzyme for purine nucleotide formation. The lack of enzyme reduces the level of necessary nucleotides and causes the accumulation of biosynthesis intermediates, which results in the aforementioned unusual behavior.
*Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): SCID is characterized by a loss of T cells. Shortage of these immune system components increases the susceptibility to infectious agents because the affected individuals cannot develop immunological memory. This immunological disorder results from a deficiency in adenosine deaminase activity, which causes a buildup of dATP. These dATP molecules then inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, which prevents of DNA synthesis.
*Huntington&#x27;s disease: this neurological disease is caused from errors that occur during DNA synthesis. These errors or mutations lead to the expression of a mutant huntingtin protein, which contains repetitive glutamine residues that are encoded by expanding CAG trinucleotide repeats in the gene. Huntington&#x27;s disease is characterized by neuronal loss and gliosis. Symptoms of the disease include: movement disorder, cognitive decline, and behavioral disorder.

Les Sables-d&#x27;Olonne station has rail connections to Paris, La Roche-sur-Yon and Nantes.

It is at the level of administrative division in the French Republic of a commune and is a sub-prefecture of the Department of Vendée.

==History==
Les Sables-d&#x27;Olonne () is French for &quot;the sands of Olonne&quot;. It was founded in 1218 from Havre d&#x27;Olonne by Savary I de Mauléon, the Lord of Mauléon, Sénéchal of Poitou and prince of Talmont. Its history is tied to the ocean for which it has served as a port and point of maritime commerce. Louis XI separated Les Sables d&#x27;Olonne from the town of Olonne in 1472. It became the largest cod-fishing port in France, with 14,000 inhabitants, in the 17th century. During the French Revolution, unlike the surrounding Vendée, the city supported the Republic, and so was often besieged—unsuccessfully, because of its port. The current local tourism industry traces its roots to bathing establishments, first begun in 1825. Rail service reached Les Sables on 29 December 1866, via the line from La Roche-sur-Yon, Bressuire, Saumur, and Tours; express service to and from Paris would arrive in 1971. The city&#x27;s port served as a base port for American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. Germany occupied Les Sables d&#x27;Olonne during World War II and, upon evacuation of that army at war&#x27;s end, the German army made an effort to destroy the port, and mined the harbor.

<doc id="1123909" wikidata="Q1143401" url="?curid=1123909" title="Cup Noodles">
<text>is a brand of cup instant ramen developed in 1971 and manufactured by Japanese food company Nissin Foods. Single servings of the product are packaged in foam, plastic, or paper cups and are prepared by adding boiling water.

The brand name Cup Noodle is also a registered trademark of Nissin Foods. In some countries, such as Japan, the singular form Cup Noodle is used. The product has inspired various competing products, such as Maruchan&#x27;s Instant Lunch.

== History ==
Instant noodles were invented in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwan-born founder of the Japanese food company Nissin. He used Chicken Ramen as the first instant ramen noodles.

In 1970, Nissin formed the subsidiary Nissin Foods (USA) Co. Inc., to sell instant noodles in the United States and opened a factory in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1973. Nissin recognized that the bowls traditionally used to package instant noodles in Asia were not common in the US, so the paper cup was designed by Ron R. Matteson. In 1971, Nissin introduced instant ramen packaged in a foam cup. The three original flavors in the US were beef, chicken and shrimp; pork flavor was added in 1976. All flavors originally contained pieces of dehydrated egg which was removed in the early 1980s. In 1978, Nissin Foods offered more new varieties of Top Ramen and Cup O&#x27; Noodles. Japan Airlines has offered Cup Noodle with the exclusive &quot;de Sky&quot; flavor on board since 1992, and since 2021 the product has been available in the airline&#x27;s online store. The product was known as Cup O&#x27; Noodles in the United States until 1993. In 1998, Cup Noodles Hot Sauce Varieties were introduced (Beef, Chicken, Pork and Shrimp).

=== Today ===

Today, instant noodles in Japan are often sold in foam bowls, sometimes with plastic utensils. Foam bowls are inexpensive, disposable, light, and easy to hold, since they insulate heat well. Different flavors are available in other parts of the world, such as tom yum in Thailand, curry in Japan, crab in Hong Kong, and churrasco in Brazil.

In 2016 the US version was changed, reducing sodium and removing MSG and artificial flavors.

== In popular culture ==

From 1996 to 2006, a Nissin Cup Noodle sign was installed in Times Square, New York City. It was located prominently near the top of the One Times Square building, the location of the Times Square Ball drop on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The sign was the most recent example in a tradition of steaming signs in Times Square, which started with an A&amp;P 8 O&#x27;Clock Coffee cup in 1933.

In 2006, a manga book was published about the invention of the cup noodle and the founder of the Nissin Cup Noodle brand, &quot;Project X: Nissin Cup Noodle&quot; by author Tadashi Katoh and artist Akira Imai (publisher: Digital Manga, ). The book was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work in 2007.

Cup Noodles are often seen in the 2012 video game &quot;Binary Domain&quot;, which is set in a futuristic version of Tokyo. It is commonly seen in billboards and advertisements throughout the city, and is even seen being eaten by some characters. Cup Noodles were also prominently featured as product placement in the 2016 video game &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;. This partnership also resulted in a crossover TV ad in Japan.

The popularity of Cup Noodles has also resulted in the creation of a Cup Noodle Museum. The museum features displays on cup noodles and their founder, Momofuku Ando. The museum is located in both Yokohama and Osaka, Japan, with the Museum also launched in Hong Kong following the stint on My Cup Noodles Factory at the Hong Kong International Airport.

In 2018, &quot;Manpuku&quot; was broadcast in Japan. The television drama series documented Momofuku Ando and his wife Masako&#x27;s lives, including the invention of instant noodles and cup noodles. It is the 99th Asadora series. It premiered on NHK on October 1, 2018, and concluded on March 30, 2019.

== Flavors ==
Flavors include Beef, Chicken, Duck, Shrimp, Teriyaki, Mushroom Chicken, Laksa, Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Tom Yam Seafood, Spicy Seafood, Seafood Curry, Kyushu White, Seafood, Thai Basil Chicken, Cream Of Chicken, Sriracha Chicken, Spicy Lime Shrimp, Hot and Spicy Shrimp, Spicy Chicken, Tonkotsu, Pork, Oriental Flavor, Yakitori Chicken and Roasted Sesame Soup.

<text>Valerie Rebecca Mahfood (born February 1, 1974) is a female boxer who is a former world Super Middleweight and Light Heavyweight champion. 
Known as &quot;The Big Bad Wolfe&quot;, Mahfood is known in the boxing world by her brawling style of fighting, and by her traditional trademark purple mohawk. She now resides in Groves, Texas.

==Career==
Mahfood began boxing professionally on July 27, 1997, knocking out Jeanne Martinez in the first round, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On April 23, 1998, she beat Brenda Cooper by a four round decision in Houston, marking her Texas debut.

She lost two of her next three fights, but she rebounded to win five fights in a row, which earned her first title try: on September 17, 1999, she knocked out Kathy Rivers in ten rounds at Panama City, Panama, to conquer the WIBF&#x27;s world Light Heavyweight title. This was also her first fight abroad.

She won three non-title bouts after that, and then, on August 10, 2000, she went down in weight to the Super Middleweight division, to fight Mary Ann Almager for the vacant IWBF title. She won her second title, with a fifth round knockout of Almager in Houston. On her next fight, she became the first boxer to defeat Ann Wolfe, knocking her out in three rounds. And till this day it stands as Ann Wolfe&#x27;s only career loss.

On November 16, 2001, she won the WIBA title by outpointing Trina Ortegon over ten rounds at Austin, and, shortly after, she beat Almager again, by an eight round split decision.

Mahfood and Laila Ali met in a long-awaited bout on November 8, 2002 in Las Vegas, Nevada, It was ESPN 2 Friday night fights series most view telecast and it was the first time a female world title fight was the main event on ESPN. A bloodied Mahfood was stopped by Ali in eight rounds, in a fight that unified the IWBF and WIBA world titles. On June 21, 2003, Mahfood and Ali had a rematch, this time in Los Angeles Staple Center on the undercard of the Lennox Lewis vs Vitali Klitschko World heavyweight Title. Mahfood lost by TKO in six while trying to recover her world title. Ali, however, suffered a serious cut (to her right eyelid) for the first (and to date, only) time in her boxing career (along with a bloodied nose). Ali retains a permanent scar from the encounter.

She won four of her next six fights, the lone loss in that span being a unanimous decision in a rematch against Wolfe. She also had a draw (tie) against Kathy Rivers, in a rematch of their Panama bout which Mahfood had won.

On September 24, 2004, Mahfood, sporting her traditional trademark purple Mohawk hairstyle, was dropped twice in the final seconds as she dropped a ten round unanimous decision to Leatitia Robinson in Atlanta, Georgia.

On November 6, 2004, Mahfood TKOd Yolanda Swindell in the second round.

Mahfood then went to Germany, and lost a 10 round unanimous decision to Natasha Ragosina.

On August 20, 2005, Mahfood fought Ann Wolfe, losing a ten round decision to Wolfe. In 2007 Mahfood fought Mary Jo Sanders for a world title.

She was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2020.

<doc id="1123914" wikidata="Q123362" url="?curid=1123914" title="Charente (river)">
<text>The Charente (; ) is a long river in southwestern France. 
Its source is in the Haute-Vienne &quot;département&quot; at Chéronnac, a small village near Rochechouart. It flows through the departments of Haute-Vienne, Charente, Vienne and Charente-Maritime. The river flows into the Atlantic Ocean near Rochefort.

==Navigation==
The Charente was described by the French king François I as &#x27;the most beautiful river in the kingdom&#x27;, and was navigable in its natural state until mills were erected at many locations in the 14th century. Some locks were built but through navigation remained impossible for centuries. Improvements to the navigation were projected under Louis XVI in 1772, but work was interrupted by the Revolution. The project was revived under the Restoration and canalisation completed in 1835. The waterway was abandoned in 1957. The &quot;départements&quot; took over operation in 1963, and recreational vessels have now taken possession of the waterway throughout the 164 km to the town of Angoulême. 

The historic towns of Cognac, Jarnac, Saintes and Rochefort make the river a popular destination for boaters, mainly in rental boats, with moorings provided at most towns and villages along the route. The locks are .

==Tributaries==
Tributaries include the rivers Antenne, Boëme, Né, Coran, Seugne, Bramerit, Boutonne, Arnoult, Touvre and Bonnieure.

The river Boutonne is navigable over a distance of 31 km to Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély, but a barrier at the confluence prevents access except under exceptional conditions.

==En route==
Towns and villages include Vergeroux, Soubise, Rochefort and Tonnay-Charente on the tidal river, and Saint-Savinien, Taillebourg, Saintes, Cognac, Jarnac, Saint-Simon and Angoulême on the navigable river, while Montignac-Charente and Civray are on the river&#x27;s upper course.

<text>Aralia spinosa, commonly known as devil&#x27;s walking stick, is a woody species of plant in the genus &quot;Aralia&quot; of the family Araliaceae. It is native to eastern North America. The various names refer to the viciously sharp, spiny stems, petioles and even leaf midribs. It has also been known as Angelica-tree. 

This species is sometimes called Hercules&#x27; club, prickly ash or prickly elder. These are common names it shares with the unrelated &quot;Zanthoxylum clava-herculis&quot;. For this reason, &quot;Aralia spinosa&quot; is sometimes confused with that species and mistakenly called the &quot;toothache tree&quot;. It does not have the medicinal properties of &quot;Zanthoxylum clava-herculis&quot;.

&quot;Aralia spinosa&quot; is occasionally cultivated for its exotic or tropical appearance because of its large lacy compound leaves. It is closely related to the Asian species &quot;Aralia elata&quot;, a more commonly cultivated species with which it is easily confused.

==Description==
&quot;Aralia spinosa&quot; is an aromatic, spiny deciduous shrub or small tree growing tall. It has a simple or, occasionally, branched stem with very large bipinnate leaves long. The trunks are up to in diameter, with the plants umbrella-like canopy in habit with open crowns. The young stems are stout and thickly covered with sharp spines. The plants generally grow in clusters of branchless trunks, although stout wide-spreading branches are occasionally produced.

The flowers are creamy-white. Each individual flower is small (about across) but produced in a large composite panicles which is long. Flowering is in late summer. The fruit is a purplish-black berry that is in diameter and ripens during fall. The roots are thick and fleshy.

The double or triple compound leaves are the largest of any temperate tree in the continental United States. Each may be about long and wide with leaflets that are long. The petioles are prickly with swollen bases. In the autumn the leaves turn to a peculiar bronze red (touched with yellow) that makes the tree conspicuous and attractive.

The habit of growth and general appearance of &quot;Aralia spinosa&quot; and related tree-forming &quot;Aralia&quot; species are unique. It is usually found as a group of unbranched stems, rising to the height of . They bear a crowded cluster of double or triple compound leaves in their canopies, thus giving each stem a certain tropical palm-like appearance. In the south, they are said to reach the height of , still retaining its palm-like looks. Further north, however, the slender, swaying palm-like appearance is most characteristic of younger plants that have not been damaged by winter storms.
* Bark: Light brown, divided into rounded, broken ridges. Branchlets are one-half to two-thirds of an inch in diameter. The branchlets are armed with stout, straight or curved, scattered prickles and almost completely encircled by narrow leaf scars. At first light yellow brown, shining and dotted. Later, light brown.
* Wood: Brown with yellow streaks. Light, soft, brittle and close-grained.
* Winter buds: Terminal bud is chestnut brown, one-half to three-fourths of an inch long, conical and blunt. Axillary buds are flattened, triangular and one-fourth of an inch in length.
* Leaves: Clustered at the end of the branches, compound, bi- and tri-pinnate, three to four feet long and two and a half feet broad. The pinnae are unequally pinnate, having five or six pairs of leaflets and a long-stalked terminal leaflet. These leaflets are often themselves pinnate. The last leaflets are ovate, two to three inches long, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, serrate or dentate and acute. Midrib and primary veins are prominent. The leaves come out of the bud a bronze green, shining and somewhat hairy. When full grown, the leaves are dark green above and pale beneath. Midribs are frequently furnished with prickles. Petioles are stout, light brown and eighteen to twenty inches in length, clasping and armed with prickles. Stipules are acute and one-half inch long.
* Flowers: July, August. Perfect or polygamomonoecious, cream white, borne in many-flowered umbels that is arranged in compound panicles. They form a terminal racemose cluster, three to four feet in length. They rise solitary, or two to three together, above the spreading leaves. Bracts and bractlets are lanceolate, acute and persistent.
* Calyx: Calyx tube, coherent with the ovary, is minutely five-toothed.
* Corolla: Five petals, white, inserted on margin of the disk, acute, slightly inflexed at the apex and imbricate in bud.
* Stamens: Five, inserted on margin of the disk and alternate with the petals. Filaments are thread-like. anthers are oblong, attached to the back, introrse and two-celled. Cells open longitudinally.
* Pistil: Inferior ovary, five-celled and connivent. stigma.
* Fruit: Berry-like drupe, globular, black, one-fourth of an inch long, five-angled and crowned with blackened styles. Flesh is thin and dark.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Aralia spinosa&quot; is widespread in the eastern United States. It ranges from New York to Florida along the Atlantic coast and westward to Ohio, Illinois, and Texas. It prefers a deep moist soil. The plants typically grow in the forest understory or at the edges of forests. They often form clonal thickets by sprouting from the roots.

This tree was admired by the Iroquois because of its usefulness and for its rarity. The Iroquois would take the saplings of the tree and plant them near their villages and on islands so that animals wouldn&#x27;t eat the valuable fruit. The fruit was used in many of the natives&#x27; foods. The women would take the flowers and put them in their hair because of the lemony smell. The flowers could also be traded for money.

In the past, botanists attributed occurrences of &quot;Aralia&quot; north of Maryland and Delaware in the Mid-Atlantic states to the introduction of &quot;Aralia spinosa&quot; from areas to the south. However, some of these occurrences are now known to be of &quot;Aralia elata&quot; (Japanese Angelica-tree), a related Asian species that is invasive to the area. &quot;A. spinosa&quot; and &quot;A. elata&quot; are difficult to distinguish in the field and leads to confusion. In at least one area of Philadelphia, &quot;A. elata&quot; is displacing &quot;A. spinosa&quot; with unknown impacts on the local ecology.
==Uses==
The young leaves can be eaten if gathered before the prickles harden. They are then chopped finely and cooked as a pot herb.

&quot;Aralia spinosa&quot; was introduced into cultivation in 1688 and is still grown for its decorative foliage, prickly stems, large showy flower panicles (clusters) and distinctive fall color. These plants are slow growing, tough and durable, do well in urban settings, but bear numerous prickles on their stems, petioles, and leaflets. These plants can be propagated from seeds or root cuttings.

Early American settlers used the plant for its alleged properties for curing toothaches.

The plant was used as a medicine during the American Civil War. In a laboratory study, extracts from the plant showed antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria associated with wound infections.

<text>Wang Zuo (; May 1898 – February 24, 1930), also Wang Yunhui () or Wang Yunfei (), nicknamed Nandougu (), was a former bandit chieftain who operated in the Jinggang Mountains of Jiangxi, from 1923, and then joined the Chinese Communist Party, becoming a protégé of Mao Zedong during their formative period in the Jiangxi Soviet. However, this cost him his own life in the following power struggle within the Chinese Communist Party.

==Early life==

Wang Zuo was born in a Hakka village in Suichuan County, Jiangxi just south of Jinggangshan City. Wang&#x27;s family was poor and his father died when he was young. The family did not have enough money for the burial, and as a result, lost the tiny piece of land they had to a local landlord who provided the money in the form of usury. Wang Zuo had to work as cowherd and gathering firewoods for the very landlord who provided usury. At the age of 15, Wang Zuo became a tailor by trade, and it was during this time he became a student of a famous local kung fu master, Wang Dongwen (), and became an expert in martial arts. Witnessing the hopeless struggle of local peasantry via legal means in the reign of corrupted Beiyang warlords, the disillusioned Wang Zuo joined the &quot;Green Forest&quot; () bandits commanded By Zhu Longzi () in 1923 and rose in ranks, though his contact with bandits could be as early as in 1921 via his kung fu master, Wang Dongwen. Wang was liked by everyone in the gang and soon supplanted the gang&#x27;s leader, Zhu Kongyang ().

In 1924, Wang Zuo became independent and formed his own gangs, which occupied the village of Dajing, which controlled the passes up Mount Jinggangshan, as their stronghold. Wang himself commandeered the large house of a former landlord as his own. He was recognised as superior by smaller bandit groups and came to be known locally as the &quot;Great King of the Mountain&quot; (). Around 1924, the &quot;Horse and Sword Brigade&quot;, formerly subordinate to Wang, came under the independent leadership of Yuan Wencai. In 1925, Wang&#x27;s subordinate staged a coup and Wang was forced to flee to Yuan, who helped him to reestablish himself. Wang and Yuan became sworn brothers and their two groups maintained close ties and cooperated to defend against the county authorities, with Yuan&#x27;s force was stationed at the foothills at Maoping, while Wang&#x27;s force was stationed in the mountains at higher elevation at Greater and Lesser Five Wells (Daxiaowujing ). Wang Zuo eventually developed the reputation of a local Robin Hood. A peasant song from the 1920s celebrates his deeds: 

:Nandougu, a tiger sitting in the mountain,
:Beating the landlord, helping the poor.
:Famed in the mountains and on the plains,
:As a king on the mountain eating the wealthy.

However, Wang Zuo gained most of his fame for his martial arts expertise in an ambush: once the unarmed Wang was along in a yard of a landlord and was suddenly besieged by more than a dozen members of landlord&#x27;s militia in the pre-planned ambush. Grabbing a bench as a weapon, Wang knocked out the landlord&#x27;s militia members who were closest to him and jumped onto the roof from the ground, and safely escaped without any injury. Experience like this elevated Wang&#x27;s status among the local populace.

==Early communist era==

Under the influence of Yuan Wencai, Wang Zuo came into contact with the local Communists in Suichuan (遂川) county around 1925, and his group were recognized as a peasant self-defence force in 1926. After the April 12 Incident, Wang Zuo, like Yuan Wencai, decided to stay with communist side, and became the only two surviving communist forces locally, each had around sixty rifles respectively. Both Yuan and Wang adopted new strategies when they resumed their banditry activities for survival in that they had only targeted the richest landlords and merchants who were mostly hated by the general population. In doing so, they had managed not only to win the support of lower and lower-middle classes, but also that of many members of the middle class such as small business owners. Consequently, this successful practice also became the source of their crimes they were accused of in their subsequent downfall, when their future comrades accused them for being &quot;Not carrying out the revolution completely&quot; and &quot;Being rightist&quot;. 

Due to the popular support from those with better economic status, the communists were able to secure a steady supply of provisions needed via trade, and helped with properties confiscated from the richest local strongmen, the communists became bolder and concentrated on guerrilla warfare against local governmental forces which were incapable of exterminating Yuan&#x27;s and Wang&#x27;s forces due to the strong popular support the communists enjoyed. However, Wang and his men had heavier influence of banditry than Yuan and his men, and although Wang enjoyed almost exclusive popular support of lower class like Yuan, his popular support from the middle class was not as great as that of Yuan Wencai. Because of this and his location deep in the mountains, Wang Zuo and his men were not as active as Yuan Wencai and his men in their guerrilla warfare against the local nationalist government. Nonetheless, in July 1927, under the order of communists, Yuan&#x27;s men and Wang&#x27;s men raided Yongxin (永新) county, freeing over 80 Chinese Communist Party (CCP) agents held in the local jail converted from a gaol. Although the town was briefly occupied, it was obvious that it was impossible for the token communist force to hold the town and thus they soon withdrew to the mountains to continue their guerrilla warfare.

==Joining Mao Zedong==

On September 30, 1927, Mao Zedong arrived at Sanwan (三湾) village of Yongxin (永新) county, just north of Jinggangshan, with the remnants from the abortive Autumn Harvest Uprising, and sent letters to both Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo to ask their help to establish a communist base locally. On October 3, 1927, Mao&#x27;s force reached the town of Ninggang (宁冈) and held a conference, at which Mao personally vetoed the suggestion to eliminate Yuan and Wang by force, and quickly established an alliance with Yuan Wencai. Wang Zuo actively seek to establish contact with Mao and in the late October, 1927, he successfully did so. With the help of Yuan Wencai, Wang met Mao Zedong at the village of Greater Well (Dajing, 大井) on October 24, 1927. Wang Zuo was initially somewhat wary, but as with Yuan, Mao approached Wang with a large gift of seventy rifles and horse saddles, and the offer of Communist instructors to give his force military training, thus successfully convinced Wang to welcome him into Wang&#x27;s base at Ciping (茨坪) on October 27, 1927. Wang provided Mao&#x27;s men with 25 tons of rice and huge amount of money soon afterward. Mao Zedong sent only one cadre, He Changgong (何长工) to assist Wang Zuo as the trainer and CCP representative, and He Changgong (何长工) helped him defeat a landlord militia unit headed by Yin Daoyi (尹道一), which had been harassing his men, he was won over. As winter approached, Mao withdrew from his forward base of Maoping to defend Jinggangshan from Dajing. 

In February 1928, the forces of Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were officially incorporated into the regular communist army as the 1st Army, 1st Division, 2nd Regiment. Yuan was named as the regimental commander, and Wang as the deputy regimental commander, with He Changgong as the CCP representative (何长工). On February 17, they participated in a successful attack at Xincheng on a battalion of the Kuomintang&#x27;s Jiangxi Army, killing the enemy commander and taking more than a hundred prisoners. Wang Zuo joined the CCP in April 1928. However, it must be said for Wang Zuo, it was more accurate to say he joined Mao Zedong&#x27;s clique than the CCP, since his loyalty was mostly to Mao personally, instead of to the CCP, which eventually caused his downfall and final death when Mao lost the power struggle with Li Lisan and Xiang Zhongfa.

Soon afterwards, Wang accompanied Mao Zedong to Lingxian county in southern Hunan province in aid of Zhu De. Jinggangshan had meanwhile been overrun by landlord militia and had to be reconquered. After Zhu De&#x27;s soldiers joined the Jinggangshan base, they were merged with the existing forces to become the Fourth &quot;Red Army&quot;. Yuan and Wang&#x27;s 2nd Regiment was renamed the 32nd Regiment. Later in the year, Zhu De&#x27;s 28th and 29th regiments crossed into Hunan. The 32nd Regiment was given the assignment of securing Maoping from the advance of the Kuomintang&#x27;s Jiangxi units until his return.

In January 1929, the bulk of the Red Army left Jinggangshan to establish a new base at Ruijin, leaving around 800 ex-Kuomintang troops under Peng Dehuai. Just after the New Year, it was agreed that Peng&#x27;s men and the 32nd Regiment of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai should stay behind to defend Jinggangshan. Under intense pressure for about a week, Peng gathered together his three surviving companies and broke through the enemy blockade with heavy casualties. For the next year Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo survived with their men in the mountains and may have returned to banditry in their guerrilla warfare. The Kuomintang&#x27;s repeated mop up operations against them proved to be futile because the communist forces only confiscated property from wealthy landlords, and distributing to peasants. As a result, such banditry was viewed positively by the local general populace, which refused to corporate with the Kuomintang forces.

==Prelude to downfall==

Jinggangshan and Jiangxi Soviet were not immune to the power struggles within the CCP in the early 1930s. Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan succeeded in rising to power under the direction and support of the Comintern and their extreme leftist policy inevitably effected all communist bases in China, including Jinggangshan. The extreme leftism of the new communist leadership included what Mao Zedong called &quot;military adventurism&quot;, which included attempts to take over the large cities, a result of unrealistic optimism on the Chinese revolution and a direct copy of the Soviet model of urban revolution.

The new strategy was obvious unfit for China at the time, and many commanders such as Peng Dehuai, Zhu De and Chen Yi voiced their opposition, Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai included, but it was useless because the new leadership refused to change its policy. As a result, the communist forces met disastrous defeats in attempts to carry out this unrealistic policy. Mao Zedong strongly opposed the military adventurism of Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan, but lost and was temporarily forced out of the communist leadership and sent to southern Jiangxi. Although Mao&#x27;s new position appeared to have the equal rank, in reality Mao was demoted. Furthermore, during the 6th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party held from June to July 1928 in Moscow, the top brass of communists passed the resolution on the &quot;Organizational Problems of Soviet Government&quot; (关于苏维埃政权组织问题决议案), in which it clearly stated that the bandits could only be utilized before the success of uprising, but afterward, they must be eliminated. This resolution had provided excellent ammo for Li Lisan and Xiang Zhongfa in their power struggle against Mao, and people like Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were obviously targets.

However, the political struggle did not end at the top leadership of the communists. In contrast to the professional soldier Peng Dehuai who faithfully attempted to carry out the impossible missions by dutifully obeying the orders despite his personal opposition, which ended in obvious defeats, Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai not only voiced their opposition in words, but also carried it out in action by simply refusing to obey the unrealistic orders from the new CCP leadership and continued to practice Mao Zedong&#x27;s strategy. The result of their actions was the obvious success that enabled Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai to have most of their force preserved. However, the relative success of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai not only proved to be useless in helping them within the CCP, but it also served as a catalyst of their downfall because their success of preserving their own forces was viewed as an urgent threat by the new communist leadership, since with greater military force, it was more difficult to remove them politically. With their primary supporter and protector Mao Zedong falling out from power, Wang Zuo&#x27;s and Yuan Wencai&#x27;s days were numbered.

When the resolution from the communist 6th National Conference held in the mid-1928 in Moscow reached the communist base in Jinggangshan, it was already winter. In the beginning of 1929, Mao held the Bailu (柏露) Conference to discuss the issue. Wang Huai (王怀), the Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of Yongxin (永新) county and You Chaoqing (尤超清), the CCP committee secretary of Ninggang (宁冈) county, who had been at odds with Yuan and Wang insisted on executing Yuan and Wang according to the resolution but their suggestion was once again vetoed by Mao. The resulting decision was a compromise that Wang would remain to command forces in the communist base, while Yuan would be named as the chief-of-staff and deployed with the communist force striking southern Jiangxi.

==Death==

In the late night of February 23, 1930, Peng Dehuai was awakened from his bed by Xiang Zhongfa&#x27;s and Li Lisan&#x27;s two lieutenants, the local CCP committee secretaries Zhu Changxie (朱昌偕) and Wang Huai (王怀), who told Peng that they had just received intelligence claiming Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai had defected to Kuomintang, and thus they need Peng&#x27;s signature to deploy troops to exterminate the traitors. Ironically, one of the supporters of Zhu Changxie (朱昌偕) and Wang Huai (王怀), You Chaoqing (尤超清), was the one who introduced Wang and Yuan to the communists. Knowing both Wang and Yuan would not do such thing, Peng initially refused and argued with them to defend Wang and Yuan. The three lieutenants of Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan then changed their story by claiming that the intelligence indeed appeared to be a rumor, and they were to be invited to a meeting to clear things up, some force would be deployed just in case. Sensing Peng Dehuai&#x27;s opposition, the three also asked Peng not to be involved by staying where he was instead of going to the planned meeting, for the sake of not to agitate situation. This tactic finally convinced Peng Dehuai who give his signature, and the three men led over 300 troops away to plot their next move.
After leaving Peng Dehuai&#x27;s camp, the three immediately faked Mao Zedong&#x27;s order to lure both Yuan and Wang to the supposed meeting to discuss the military situation. But once Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai reached the meeting, they were shot in obscure circumstances, allegedly ambushed while trying to rebel. Wang managed to escape out a window but drowned while attempting to cross a river.

==Legacy==

As early as October of that year, Mao Zedong criticised the officials in power of the Jiangxi Soviet for the assassination of his old allies. Just who gave the order for the death of Wang Zuo, however, is still not clear, although a number of officials of the Jiangxi CCP were implicated. Wang Yunlong (王雲隆), Wang Zuo&#x27;s younger brother and an officer of the 32nd Regiment, became the new leader of his brother&#x27;s men, and defected to Kuomintang. After Wang Yunlong (王雲隆)&#x27;s death, Wang Zuo&#x27;s son became the leader and it was not until nearly two decades later in 1949 when the communists were finally able to retake Jinggangshan. 

After 1949, both Yuan and Wang were marked as examples of ideologically reformed bandits who had been transformed into Communist soldiers. Both were recognised as martyrs of the Chinese Revolution. In 1951 Wang&#x27;s grave was moved to Dajing, where a monument was erected in his honour. Although Peng Dehuai was not directly involved in the death of Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo, as proved by the history, that did not prevent Mao Zedong from blaming it on Peng, and Peng Dehuai was persecuted 30 years later, the death of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai was one of the alleged crime Peng committed against Mao, and this alleged crime again appeared during the Cultural Revolution when Peng Dehuai was struggled by the Red Guards.

<text>KXLU (88.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting out of Loyola Marymount University in southwest Los Angeles, California. It was first on the air in 1957, and in 2007, celebrated its 50th anniversary. It is a non-commercial college radio station that plays many styles of music broadly classified under rock, specialty, fine arts, alternative music and Latin jazz. KXLU has a small, cult following among music fans in the general Los Angeles metropolitan area. The station&#x27;s rock programming runs between 2am and 6pm on weekdays and the hosts during this time are predominantly college students. Specialty shows include &quot;Stray Pop&quot; hosted by Stella, &quot;Music For Nimrods&quot; hosted by Reverend Dan, &quot;She Rocks&quot; hosted by McAllister, Biancadonk and Cass Monster, &quot;In a Dream&quot; hosted by Mystic Pete, &quot;The Bomb Shelter&quot; hosted by Uncle Tim, &quot;Livation&quot; hosted by Robert Douglas and Hilary Russell, &quot;The Molotov Cocktail Hour&quot; hosted by Cyrano &amp; Señor Amor, &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot; hosted by Taylor 2000, &quot;Neuz Pollution&quot; hosted by Chris Candy and Maki, &quot;Demolisten&quot; hosted by Fred and Sean Carnage, &quot;A Fistful Of Vinyl&quot; hosted by Alec &amp; John, and &quot;Center Stage&quot; hosted by Mark Gordon, among other programs.

==KXLU Demolisten history==
Demolisten has been a weekly show on KXLU since 1984, which only plays demos from unsigned acts. It is credited with introducing numerous acts to the public.

The show began in 1984 when &quot;DJ Agent Ava&quot; took a couple reel-to-reel tapes of Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Faith No More, and decided to start a radio show of nothing but demo tapes. Once word got out about the show, she soon acquired demos from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Guns N&#x27; Roses, The Jesus and Mary Chain and others.

Perry Farrell, in the book &quot;Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; said, &quot;The cool thing about KXLU&#x27;s Demolisten show was if you were a local band you could just call in, request your song and if you went down there, they would interview you... I was listening to KXLU all day long because that&#x27;s where all the good music was. The rest of the world was out of it.&quot;

The early 1990s DJs featured Fred Kiko, Chad, and Tony Kiewel. They&#x27;ve often been credited with the discovery of Beck, who donated a track to the &quot;Demolisten: Volume 2&quot; CD, and also played music by Jimmy Tamborello (The Postal Service, Dntel), who was a friend and fellow KXLU DJ at the time.

Tony Kiewel left the show for an A&amp;R position at Sub Pop Records in 2000.

The early 2000s continued to feature Fred, with Devin Valdesuso and Doug Jones (label owner of Kittridge Records).

Hosts have included the International Voice of Reason AKA IVOR, and others.

In 2002, Fred was joined by co-host Octavius Poirier (former guitarist for Artichoke and Chewing Foil). Audio archives of KXLU Demolisten have been saved online since 2003.

In 2011 and 2012, Demolisten was hosted by Fred and Sean Carnage of Sean Carnage Monday Nights @ Pehrspace in Historic Filipino Town in Echo Park.

Since 2013, Fred has been hosting the show on his own. In 2013, Demolisten started hosting live shows at Time Warp Music in Mar Vista.

===Interviews and reviews===
The members of KXLU Demolisten were on a TV show in Canada where they were interviewed by Laurie Pike circa 1995. There is a writeup of the show in LA Weekly Feb. 24, 1998. They were nominated as best radio show in Los Ángeles by the LA Weekly: published June 2, 1999. They were mentioned in Slate Magazine as an influence on the author&#x27;s music taste on Nov. 29, 2004. Also mentioned in The Los Ángeles Alternative, an independent newspaper, when KXLU won one of the top 5 radio stations in the city in the people&#x27;s choice awards: Published June 30, 2006. Demolisten was featured in an independent film, &quot;Destroy the Rocker&quot;, about the Los Ángeles music scene.

<doc id="1123950" wikidata="Q7545167" url="?curid=1123950" title="Smith Hempstone">
<text>Smith Hempstone (February 1, 1929 – November 19, 2006) was a journalist, author, and the United States ambassador to Kenya from 1989 to 1993. He was a vocal proponent of democracy, advocating free elections for Kenya.

==Early life and education==
Hempstone was born February 1, 1929, Washington, D.C. He attended George Washington University, and later transferred to the in Sewanee, Tennessee, where he graduated.

==Career==
From 1949 to 1952, he was a U.S. Marine in the Korean War, and left the Marines with the rank of captain.

He then did radio rewrite for the Associated Press in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1952. He was a reporter for the &quot;Louisville Times&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky in 1953, a rewrite editor at &quot;National Geographic&quot; in Washington, D.C. in 1954, and then a reporter at &quot;The Washington Star&quot; from 1955 to 1956. He was a fellow of the Institute of Current World Affairs in Africa from 1956 to 1960.

===Foreign correspondent===
In 1961, Hempstone became a foreign correspondent for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in Africa, where he served until 1964, and then in Latin America in 1965. In 1966, he joined &quot;The Washington Star&quot; as foreign correspondent in Latin America. From 1966 to 1969, he was &quot;The Star&quot;″s correspondent in Europe. He was associate editor and editorial page director of &quot;The Star&quot; from 1970 to 1975. In 1975, following a disagreement with &quot;The Star&quot; new owner Joe L. Allbritton, he left the newspaper. Beginning in 1975, he authored a syndicated twice-weekly column, &quot;Our Times&quot;, which carried in over 90 newspapers.

===The Washington Times===
In 1982, Hempstone was named executive editor of the newly founded &quot;Washington Times&quot; and, following the resignation of editor and publisher James R. Whelan in 1984, briefly served as editor of the paper before being replaced by Arnaud de Borchgrave.

===U.S. ambassador to Kenya===
In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Hempstone ambassador to Kenya at a time when the United States was beginning to pressure African countries to democratize and improve human rights. Hempstone worked toward these goals by advocating for multiparty elections in Kenya in 1991, nine years after Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi banned all parties except his own. The Moi administration derided him, saying he failed to understand that strong, unified government was necessary to keep Kenya&#x27;s tribal groups from dividing the nation. 

Hempstone aided dissidents and befriended opponents of the Moi administration, causing the African press to describe his style as &quot;bulldozer diplomacy.&quot; The Kenyan government isolated him and, according to Hempstone&#x27;s book &quot;Rogue Ambassador: An African Memoir,&quot; twice attempted to kill him. Multi-party elections were ultimately held in Kenya in 1992, which were won by Moi with 36 percent of the vote.

In 2001, former Kenyan government minister Nicholas Biwott successfully sued Hempstone in High Court Civil Suit Case No. 1273 in Kenya for suggesting in his autobiography that Biwott had been involved in the murder Robert Ouko, Kenya&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs, in February 1990. Hempstone did not defend himself in the suit.

==Death==
On November 19, 2006, Hempstone died from complications of diabetes in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.

<doc id="1123955" wikidata="Q4356716" url="?curid=1123955" title="George Bizos">
<text>George Bizos (; 14 November 19279 September 2020) was a Greek-South African human rights lawyer who campaigned against apartheid in South Africa. He was noted for representing Nelson Mandela during the Rivonia Trial. He instructed Mandela to add the qualification &quot;if needs be&quot; to his trial address, which is credited with sparing him from a sentence of death. Bizos also represented the families of anti-apartheid activists killed by the government, throughout the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He also represented victims of the Marikana massacre.

== Early life ==

Bizos was the son of Antonios &quot;Antoni&quot; Bizos, the mayor of the small village of Vasilitsi, south of Koroni and Kalamata on the Messenia peninsula of the Peloponnese, Greece. He was born on 14 November 1927, although this was erroneously recorded on his South African identity documents as 1928, owing to his father&#x27;s declaration to the authorities upon arrival in Egypt.

In May 1941 at the age of thirteen, Bizos and his father helped seven New Zealand Army soldiers (Don Gladding, Mick Karup, Peter Martin, John Lewis and three others) who were hiding in the hills to escape the German-occupied Greek mainland for Crete. The 9 set out to sea at night, with only a cheap compass and a map torn from an atlas, intending to escape to Crete. On the second day at sea, rough winds took the sail out of control and tore through its canvas. The men had to take turns to row, right through the night, until they managed to repair the sail. On the third day, they spotted a ship in the distance. They managed to attract the attention of the crew of what turned out to be the British destroyer, HMS &quot;Kimberley&quot;, on its way to the Battle of Crete. After the battle, the &quot;Kimberley&quot; dropped him and his father off at Alexandria, Egypt.

As a refugee, Bizos was sent to the Union of South Africa and landed in Durban. From there he went by train to Johannesburg, disembarking at the Braamfontein railway station. At the time, the Ossewabrandwag, an Afrikaner group with Nazi sympathies, were demonstrating against the arrival of refugees. The Ossewabrandwag blamed Jan Smuts for bringing the &quot;vuilgoed&quot; (rubbish) of Europe to South Africa. The local Greek community helped integrate him into society.

Bizos did not go to school for his first two years in the country as he spoke neither English nor Afrikaans. He gained entry to the University of the Witwatersrand in 1949, where he met Nelson Mandela and undertook a 3-year Bachelor of Arts degree, followed by a three-year LLB law degree. It was during this time that he first became politically active, joining the students&#x27; representative council under the leadership of Harold Wolpe.

== Legal career ==
===Apartheid era===
Bizos joined the Bar in Johannesburg in 1954. During the 1950s and 1960s he was counsel to a wide range of well-known people including Trevor Huddleston of Sophiatown.

At the Rivonia Trial from 1963 to 1964, Bizos was part of the team that defended Nelson Mandela, Govan Mbeki and Walter Sisulu. The accused were sentenced to life imprisonment, but spared the death penalty. Although it is sometimes said that he claims to have drafted Mandela&#x27;s famous speech spoken at the trial, he says that his main contribution was to advise the use of the words &quot;if needs be&quot; before Mandela said that he was prepared to die. Bizos believed that this may have contributed to the avoidance of the death penalty, by having Mandela not appear to seek martyrdom. This trial saw the arrival of a group of human rights lawyers – Joel Joffe, Harry Schwarz, Arthur Chaskalson and Harold Hanson.

Bizos was council for the accused in at least 26 other prominent anti-apartheid trials and inquests. In 1969 he acted for the defence of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and 21 others on charges of contravening the Suppression of Communism Act and Unlawful Organisations Act. Together with Arthur Chaskalson and Dennis Kuny, he also represented the NUSAS Five who were charged with furthering the aims of the African National Congress and communism in 1975.

Bizos subsequently became a senior member of the Johannesburg Bar in 1978. He was a member of the National Council of Lawyers for Human Rights, which he helped found in 1979. He was senior counsel at the Legal Resources Centre in Johannesburg in the Constitutional Litigation Unit. He also served as a judge on Botswana&#x27;s Court of Appeal from 1985 to 1993.

===Post-apartheid===
Bizos became a member of the African National Congress&#x27; (ANC) Legal and Constitutional Committee in 1990, and at Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) he served as advisor to the negotiating teams and participated in drawing up the Interim Constitution. He was involved in the drafting of legislation, and particularly the &quot;Truth and Reconciliation Bill&quot; and amendments to the &quot;Criminal Procedures Act&quot;, to bring it into line with Chapter 3 of the constitution, guaranteeing fundamental human rights to all citizens of South Africa.

Bizos was retained as counsel at various inquests into the deaths of people in detention. During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, he was the leader of the team that opposed applications for amnesty on behalf of the Biko, Hani, Goniwe, Calata, Mkonto, Mhlauli, Slovo and Schoon families.

Bizos was appointed by President Mandela to the Judicial Services Commission in 1994. It was responsible for recommending candidates for appointment as judges, as well as proposing post-apartheid reforms to the judicial system. Bizos was the leader of the team for the South African Government to argue that the death penalty was unconstitutional, and counsel for the National Assembly in the Certification of the Constitution by the Constitutional Court. He later served as a legal advisor to Mandela in 2005, during a bitter legal dispute with the latter&#x27;s former lawyer, Ismail Ayob. He also represented the Chinese Association of South Africa in a case that ended in 2008 in which Chinese South Africans were granted &#x27;previously disadvantaged&#x27; status, thus qualifying them for Black Economic Empowerment benefits.

===Film about Rivonia===
In 2017 Bizos appeared along with surviving defendants at the Rivonia Trial, Denis Goldberg, Andrew Mlangeni and Ahmed Kathrada, along with fellow defence lawyers Joel Joffe and Denis Kuny, in a documentary film entitled &quot;Life is Wonderful&quot;, directed by Sir Nicholas Stadlen, which tells the story of the trial. The title reflects Goldberg&#x27;s words to his mother at the end of the trial on hearing that he and his comrades had been spared the death sentence.

=== Notable people represented ===
Bizos represented the following people, among others:

* Nelson Mandela, since the 1950s
* Trevor Huddleston of Sophiatown, 1950s
* Mac Maharaj in the Little Rivonia Trial
* Govan Mbeki in the Rivonia Trial in 1963–64
* Walter Sisulu in the Rivonia Trial in 1963–64, and afterwards his wife

* Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change of Zimbabwe, when he was charged with planning a coup d&#x27;état before the 2002 general elections
* Winnie Madikizela-Mandela

== Other activities ==
In the 1970s Bizos helped start a Greek school, called SAHETI. It embraced Hellenism, yet was non-exclusionist, even during the heart of apartheid. It was here that people like Chris Hani&#x27;s children were educated.

Two of Mandela&#x27;s daughters brought court action in 2013 to oust Bizos, ex-Housing Minister Tokyo Sexwale and lawyer Bally Chuene as directors of two of Mandela&#x27;s firms. Bizos said that the daughters were trying to &quot;get their hands on things that should not be sold&quot;. The case was delayed after the daughters&#x27; lawyer Ismail Ayob withdrew from the case.

== Personal life and death ==
Bizos was married to Arethe Daflos, known as &quot;Rita&quot;, who he met in 1948 when she was an art student. The couple had three sons. Rita died in 2017, shortly before her husband&#x27;s 90th birthday.

Bizos died of natural causes at home on 9 September 2020 at the age of 92.
He was given a special state funeral on 17 September and was buried at Westpark Cemetery next to his wife Rita.

*1999: Order for Meritorious Service Class II medal from then President Mandela.
*2001: International Trial Lawyer Prize of the Year by the International Academy of Trial Lawyers.
*2004: The International Bar Association (IBA) named Bizos the winner of the 2004 Bernard Simons Memorial Award

<doc id="1123956" wikidata="Q490066" url="?curid=1123956" title="Angermünde">
<text>Angermünde () is a town in the district of Uckermark in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. It is about northeast of Berlin, the capital of Germany.

The population is about 14,000, but has been declining since its traditional industrial base, enamel-working, has declined. An administrative sub-centre of its district, it has several Protestant churches, a former Franciscan church, a number of schools of higher learning and a recently refurbished historic marketplace with an old town hall. Located in the game-filled forests of the Uckermark, with its many lakes, it now relies heavily on tourism and the sources of revenue linked to it.

Since 2010, Angermünde is a federally declared resort town.

==Name==

The name Angermünde is an abbreviation of the older town of Tangermünde, for a while the town was named New-Tangermünde (&quot;Neu-Tangermünde&quot;), until it was changed to &quot;Angermünde&quot;, with &quot;Anger&quot; being German for a central square in a town.

== Geography ==

Angermünde is located in the Uckermarck region, roughly 69 km north of Berlin. It is made up of the Inner City (German: &quot;Kernstadt&quot;), and 23 adjacent districts. The districts are: Altkünkendorf, Biesenbrow, Bölkendorf, Bruchhagen, Crussow, Dobberzin, Frauenhagen, Gellmersdorf, Görlsdorf, Greiffenberg, Günterberg, Herzsprung, Kerkow, Mürow, Neukünkendorf, Schmargendorf, Schmiedeberg, Steinhöfel, Stolpe, Welsow, Wilmersdorf, Wolletz, and Zuchenberg. In addition, there are 40 registered neighborhoods (German: &quot;Wohnplätze&quot;) within the districts. The registered neighborhood are: Altenhof, Augustenfelde, Ausbau, Ausbau Mürower Straße, Ausbau Pinnower Weg, Ausbau Welsower Weg, Bauernsee, Blumberger Mühle, Breitenteicher Mühle, Friedrichsfelde, Gehegemühle, Glambecker Mühle, Greiffenberg Siedlung, Grumsin, Henriettenhof, Klein Frauenhagen, Leistenhof, Leopoldsthal, Linde, Lindenhof, Louisenhof, Luisenthal, Mürow-Oberdorf, Neu-Günterberg, Neuhaus, Neuhof, Peetzig, Rosinthal, Schäferei, Sonnenhof, Sternfelde, Stolper Mühle, Thekenberg, Waldfried, Waldfrieden, Wilhelmsfelde, Wilhelmshof, Ziethenmühle, und Zollende. With an area of around 324 km2, Angermünde was, as of 2020, Germany&#x27;s 17th largest municipality.

== Climate ==

==History==
The town was the site of a 1420 victory of Frederick I of Brandenburg over the Pomeranians.

From 1815 to 1947, Angermünde was part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. In the 19th century, the town was the seat of a Prussian circle in the Province of Brandenburg and linked to Berlin by the Berlin–Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) railway. Angermünde station then served as the junction for branch lines servicing Prenzlau, Bad Freienwalde, and Schwedt.

From 1947 to 1952, Angermünde was part of the State of Brandenburg, from 1952 to 1990 of the Bezirk Frankfurt of East Germany and since 1990 again of Brandenburg.

<doc id="1123958" wikidata="Q4638089" url="?curid=1123958" title="44th New Zealand Parliament">
<text>The 44th New Zealand Parliament was a term of the Parliament of New Zealand. Its composition was determined by the 1993 elections, and it sat until the 1996 elections.

The 44th Parliament was the last to be elected under the old FPP electoral system, with voters approving a change to MMP at the same time as they voted in the 1993 elections. As such, the 44th Parliament saw a considerable amount of positioning for the change — at the beginning of the term, there were four parties in Parliament, but at the end, there were seven parties and one independent. The National Party, which had begun the term with a majority, was forced by the end of the term to form a coalition with several smaller parties to remain in power. Despite the various maneuverings, however, the National Party remained in government for the duration of the 44th Parliament, which comprised National&#x27;s second term in office. The other three parties present at the start of the 44th Parliament, being the Labour Party, the Alliance, and New Zealand First, all remained in opposition.

The 44th Parliament consisted of ninety-nine representatives, two more than the previous Parliament. All of these representatives were chosen by single-member geographical electorates, including four special Māori electorates.

From 1991 to 1996—including the entirety of the 44th term of Parliament—MPs met in a debating chamber in Bowen House while Parliament House was being refurbished.

==Electoral boundaries for the 44th Parliament==
==Overview of seats==
The table below shows the number of MPs in each party following the 1993 election and at dissolution:

Notes
*The Working Government majority is calculated as all Government MPs less all other parties.
* The Green Party entered a confidence and supply agreement with the Labour-Alliance coalition

==Initial composition of the 44th Parliament==
==Changes during 44th Parliament==
There was one by-election held during the term of the 44th Parliament.

===Summary of changes during term===

*Ruth Richardson, the National Party MP for Selwyn, quit Parliament in August 1994, having been replaced as Minister of Finance the previous year. Her departure prompted a by-election in Selwyn, which was won by David Carter of the National Party.
*Peter Dunne, the Labour Party MP for Onslow, left his party in October 1994, believing that Labour was becoming increasingly left-wing. He was an independent for a time before founding the small Future New Zealand party. He would later join with United (see below).
*Ross Meurant, the National Party MP for Hobson, left his party in September 1994, having clashed on a number of issues with the party&#x27;s leadership. He eventually established the Right of Centre party.
*Graeme Lee, the National Party MP for Matakana, left his party in 1994, partly due to policy disputes with its leadership and partly due to having lost his Cabinet post in a reshuffle. He founded a new party which eventually became the Christian Democrat Party.
*Trevor Rogers, the National Party MP for Howick, left his party in June 1995, after disputes regarding policy issues with the party&#x27;s leadership. He joined Ross Meurant&#x27;s new party.
*A group of centrist MPs from both the National Party and the Labour Party, along with Peter Dunne and his Future New Zealand party, established a centrist party named United New Zealand in June 1995. The MPs who founded United were Margaret Austin, Bruce Cliffe, Peter Dunne, Clive Matthewson, Pauline Gardiner, Peter Hilt, and John Robertson.
*Ross Meurant, founder of Right of Centre, came into conflict with his own party (now renamed the Conservatives) in February 1996, and left the party to become an independent again. Trevor Rogers, the sole remaining MP, became leader.
*Jack Elder, the Labour Party MP for Henderson, Peter McCardle, the National Party MP for Heretaunga, and Michael Laws, the National Party MP for Hawke&#x27;s Bay, all left their parties to join New Zealand First in April 1996.
*Michael Laws, the New Zealand First (originally National) MP for Hawkes Bay, resigned from Parliament after the so-called &quot;Antoinette Beck&quot; controversy. Rather than hold a by-election, the Prime Minister simply brought the 1996 general election forward slightly, as the rules allow that if a general election is approaching, a vacant seat need not be filled immediately.

<doc id="1123962" wikidata="Q3431130" url="?curid=1123962" title="Shakedown (continuum mechanics)">
<text>In continuum mechanics, elastic shakedown behavior is one in which plastic deformation takes place during running in, while due to residual stresses or strain hardening the steady state is perfectly elastic.

Plastic shakedown behavior is one in which the steady state is a closed elastic-plastic loop, with no net accumulation of plastic deformation.

Ratcheting behavior is one in which the steady state is an open elastic-plastic loop, with the material accumulating a net strain during each cycle.

Shakedown concept can be applied to solid metallic materials under cyclic repeated loading or to granular materials under cyclic loading (such case can occur in road pavements under traffic loading).

==Ratcheting Check==

Not needed for only primary loading that meets static loading requirements.

Needed for cyclic thermal loading plus primary loading with a mean.

==Shakedown of granular materials==
If repeated loading on the granular induces stress beyond the yield surface, three different cases may be observed. In case 1 the residual strain in the materials increases almost without limit. This so-called “ratcheting” state is close to what can be predicted applying simple Mohr–Coulomb criterion to a cyclic loading. In the responses like case 2, residual strain in the materials grows to some extent, but at some stage the growth is stopped and further cyclic loading produces closed hysteresis loops of stress–strain. Finally in case 3 the growth of residual strain is practically diminishes when sufficient loading cycles are applied. Case 2 and case 3 are cases of plastic and elastic shakedown respectively.

<text>Edward Turnour, 6th Earl Winterton, PC (4 April 1883 – 26 August 1962), styled Viscount Turnour until 1907, was an Irish peer and British politician who served as a Member of Parliament for 47 years, attaining the rare distinction of serving as both Baby of the House and Father of the House at the opposite ends of his career in the House of Commons.

==Background==
Turnour was the son of Edward Turnour, 5th Earl Winterton, and Lady Georgiana Susan Hamilton (1841–1913), daughter of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn.

Turnour was educated at Eton College.

==Political career==
Turnour was first elected for Horsham in a by-election in 1904 at the age of just 21, the youngest Member of Parliament (MP) in the Commons, and remained an MP for the next 47 years. In 1907 he succeeded his father, becoming 6th Earl Winterton. This was an Irish peerage and did not disqualify him from remaining a member of the House of Commons. Sitting as a Conservative, Winterton slowly rose through the ranks, later achieving ministerial office as Under-Secretary of State for India in 1922, a post he held until 1924. In 1924 he was sworn of the Privy Council and once again served as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1924 to 1929.

Winterton did not hold office in the National Governments headed by firstly Ramsay MacDonald and then Stanley Baldwin. However, when Neville Chamberlain became Prime Minister in May 1937, Winterton was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In March 1938 he was promoted to the Cabinet and given the job of speaking in the House of Commons on behalf of the Secretary of State for Air Viscount Swinton, a member of the House of Lords. In this role he proved a noted failure, especially in a heated debate in May 1938 which led to Chamberlain concluding that the Secretary of State for Air must be an MP. In July 1938 he led the British delegation to the Evian Conference at which the problem of the Jewish refugees was debated. Thereafter, Winterton was increasingly sidelined. The following year he was dropped from the Cabinet and served in the marginal post of Paymaster General before leaving the government altogether.

Winterton remained a Member of Parliament until 1951, by which time he was the MP with the longest continuous service. In 1952 he was created Baron Turnour, of Shillinglee in the County of Sussex, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. The Patent creating this peerage is currently in the possession of Mark Lindley-Highfield of Ballumbie Castle.

==Personal life==
In September 1910 the mother of Ivy Gordon-Lennox acted to contradict a rumour that her daughter was engaged to marry Winterton, going so far as to place a notice in &quot;The New York Times&quot; to say that there was no engagement. Winterton married the Honourable Cecilia Monica Wilson, daughter of Charles Wilson, 2nd Baron Nunburnholme, in 1924. The marriage was childless. Winterton died in August 1962, aged 79, when the barony of Turnour became extinct. He was succeeded in his Irish titles by his kinsman, Ronald Chard Turnour, 7th Earl Winterton.

<doc id="1123967" wikidata="Q498030" url="?curid=1123967" title="Uija of Baekje">
<text>Uija (595?–660, r. 641–660) was the 31st and final ruler of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. His reign ended when Baekje was conquered by an alliance of the rival Korean kingdom Silla and China&#x27;s Tang dynasty.

== Background ==
During this time, the northern Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, under the control of Yeon Gaesomun, took aggressive stances against Silla and the Tang. Silla responded by eventually allying closely with Tang China, threatening Baekje in the middle.

According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Uija was the eldest son of King Mu. According to a legend in the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, Mu was a Baekje peasant who married Princess Seonhwa of Silla (making her Uija&#x27;s mother), but this is not considered orthodox history. Uija was made crown prince in January 632 and became king upon his father&#x27;s death in 641.

== Reign ==
Although friendly with Tang China at first, Uija soon allied with Goguryeo to attack Silla. In 642, he led a campaign against Silla and conquered some 40 castles. He also sent a force of 10,000 to take Silla&#x27;s Daeya Fortress and kill Kim Chunchu&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law. The next year, with Goguryeo, Baekje attacked Silla again and tried to block its diplomatic route to Tang China. When Silla-Tang forces attacked Goguryeo in 645, he attacked Silla and took seven castles. Baekje and Goguryeo hit Silla&#x27;s northern border in 655.

Soon upon becoming king, Uija undertook political reform to control the powers of the aristocracy. However, his reign was plagued by the internal power struggle among the nobles and corruption and decadence within the court.

As the court fell into disarray, the Silla-Tang alliance, repeatedly frustrated by Goguryeo&#x27;s Yeon Gaesomun, changed strategy and decided to attack Goguryeo&#x27;s ally Baekje first.

== Fall of Baekje ==
In 660, Baekje&#x27;s navy was defeated by Tang&#x27;s navy, and Silla&#x27;s army led by Kim Yu-sin defeated Baekje&#x27;s army led by Gye Baek. Sabi, Baekje&#x27;s capital, (in present-day Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province) was surrounded by the Silla-Tang allied forces. Uija and the crown prince escaped to Ungjin (in present-day Gongju), but surrendered when Sabi fell.

He was taken to Tang along with his sons Buyeo Hyo and Buyeo Yung, 88 retainers, and 12,807 Baekje peasants. Another of his sons, Buyeo Pung, later attempted to restore his father&#x27;s kingdom.

In 2000, his remains were retrieved from China and buried in a new tomb in Neungsan-ri, Buyeo County, South Chungcheong Province, South Korea, near what was Baekje&#x27;s final capital, Sabi.

Uija was his personal name; he did not receive a posthumous name.

== Family ==
* Father: Mu of Baekje
* Mother: Lady Sataek (沙宅王后, ?–642) – daughter of Minister Sataek Jeokdeok (沙宅積德), later became the Empress Dowager Munjeong (文貞太后, 문정태후) during her son&#x27;s reign.

*** Buyeo Pung (扶餘豊, 623–668) – sent as hostage to Japan in 643 with younger brother where they called him Fuyu Hōshō but returned to recover Baekje. Declared king by Gwisil Boksin under the name King Pungjang (豊璋王) but was soon captured and exiled to Southern China.
**** Buyeo Sa (扶餘絲, ?–?) – son of Buyeo Pung who escaped to Japan but was assassinated by Silla agents but is the ancestor of several Japanese clans. He was called Teika-Ō (禎嘉王) in Japan.
*** Buyeo Yong (扶餘勇, ?–?) – led the Baekje revolutionary army along with his brother Pung but was defeated and exiled.
*** Buyeo Chung&#x27;seung (扶餘忠勝, ?–?) – took part in the revival movement, fate unknown.
*** Buyeo Chungji (扶餘忠志, ?–?) – took part in the revival movement, fate unknown.

<text>Petroliam Nasional Berhad, commonly known as PETRONAS (stylised in all caps), is a Malaysian multinational oil and gas company headquartered in Kuala Lumpur. Established in 1974, it is a legal entity incorporated under the Malaysian Companies Act 1965 and reports to the company&#x27;s Board of Directors. The corporation, with a presence in over 100 countries, is vested with all oil and gas resources in Malaysia and is entrusted with the responsibility of developing and adding value to these resources. In the annual Fortune Global 500 list for 2022, Petronas was ranked at 216th. It also ranked 48th globally in the 2020 Bentley Infrastructure 500.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; has identified Petronas as one of the &quot;new seven sisters&quot;, considered to be influential and mainly state-owned national oil and gas companies from countries outside the OECD. The company is engaged in a broad spectrum of petroleum activities, including upstream exploration and production of oil and gas to downstream oil refining; marketing and distribution of petroleum products; trading; gas processing and liquefaction; gas transmission pipeline network operations; marketing of liquefied natural gas; petrochemical manufacturing and marketing; shipping; automotive engineering; and property investment. Petronas provides a substantial source of income for the Malaysian government, accounting for more than 15% of the government&#x27;s revenue from 2015 to 2020.

==History==
Before the formation of Malaysia, Royal Dutch Shell (now Shell plc) first began the oil exploration in Miri, Sarawak; after Charles Brooke signed the first Oil Mining Lease in 1909. In 1910, the first oil well was drilled in Miri. This oil well is later known as the Grand Old Lady. In 1929, oil was discovered in Brunei. There were no other drilling activities in Borneo or British Malaya until 1950s. In 1966, the enactment of Petroleum Mining Act gave Exxon and Shell rights to explore oil territories and produce oil royalties and tax payments to the government. In the late 1960s, Esso and Continental Oil were given concessions to explore oil off the shores of the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. By 1974, Malaysia&#x27;s output of crude oil stood at about to .

===1970s: Establishment with the Malaysian Government===
Several factors converged in the early 1970s to prompt the Malaysian government into setting up a state-owned oil and gas company. In 1972, the oil price per barrel was US$1.50, which later rose to US$2.28 per barrel. War in the middle east and oil embargo by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had caused the price per barrel to rise until US$12.00, thus giving more incentives for Malaysia to set up her own oil company. Several countries such as United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Indonesia have adopted the production sharing agreement instead of a concession system for oil revenue distribution. The Malaysian government also believed that foreign oil companies did not properly inform the government regarding the oil exploration activities in their own concessions (such as the new discovery of oil fields), thus resulted in a loss of revenue to the government. The formulation of Malaysian New Economic Policy in the early 1970s encourages Malaysians to take control of various modern industries and to open more economic opportunities for bumiputera (Malaysian natives).

The former chief minister of Sarawak, Abdul Rahman Ya&#x27;kub was the first one who proposed the idea of Malaysia setting up an oil company in 1965, when he was the federal lands and mines deputy minister. It was due to the pressure of the Sarawak people who sought to clarify the exact boundaries of Sarawak territorial waters. In fact, since the formation of Malaysia in 1963, the issue of territorial waters of Sabah and Sarawak has not been fully addressed, thus leaving its interpretation wide open. The Sarawak government has declared that the territorial waters extend well beyond the three-mile limit defined by the Malaysian federal government. However, Abdul Rahman Ya&#x27;kub was reminded of Tun Abdul Razak&#x27;s act of installing him as the chief minister of Sarawak. Therefore, Rahman decided to keep the conflict as low profile as possible. Rahman&#x27;s nephew, Abdul Taib Mahmud assumed the role of federal deputy land and mines minister after Rahman became education minister and later, chief minister of Sarawak. Taib believed in the sharing of oil royalties between the state and the federal government. During the time, the oil mining activities in Sarawak were still under the exclusive control of Shell. Taib Mahmud initially suggested allowing independent contractors to market government oil. Taib found a Lebanese trader to purchase the Malaysian oil, however, the contractor defaulted on payments, resulting in US$4 million loss. A government hydrocarbon committee was later set up. Taib Mahmud visited Indonesia and had a discussion with Pertamina (Indonesian state-owned oil and gas company). Taib suggested that Malaysia scrap the concession system and replace it with a production sharing agreement. However, there were no laws that allowed Malaysia to take back the concessions without compensating foreign oil companies. Despite this, Taib decided to set up a statutory body named &quot;HIKMA&quot; (Hidrokarbon Malaysia), which would have total rights of oil found in the territorial waters of Sabah and Sarawak. However, Rahman Ya&#x27;kub protested his nephew&#x27;s decision and threatened to take the federal government to court if Sarawak were to be left out of this oil deal. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah (chairman of Perbadanan Nasional Berhad (Pernas)) visited Rahman at the latter&#x27;s private residence in Kuching. Tengku Razaleigh suggested the formation of a company instead of a statutory body where the former would distribute profits equally between the federal and the state governments. Rahman agreed with the suggestion. Tengku Razaleigh drafted the Petroleum Development Act together with his associates in secret, as instructed by Tun Razak, and to be completed before the 1974 Malaysian general election. Rahman Ya&#x27;kub then telephoned Tengku Razaleigh to ask about the terms offered by the Malaysian federal government. Tengku Razaleigh then told Rahman regarding abolishment of the concession system. Meanwhile, 5% oil royalty will be given to the respective oil-producing states. Rahman agreed with the deal.

In 1974, the Petroleum Development Act was tabled and approved in parliament. Petronas was incorporated on 17 August 1974, and Tengku Razaleigh became its inaugural chairman. Initially, Exxon and Shell refused to surrender their concessions and refused to negotiate with Petronas. Petronas then served a notice to all foreign oil companies that after 1 April 1975, all the foreign oil companies would be operating illegally in Malaysian waters if they do not start negotiations with Petronas. After a few rounds of negotiations, foreign oil companies finally surrendered their concessions to Petronas. While all other oil-producing states in Malaysia signed the petroleum agreement, Tun Mustapha, the chief minister of Sabah, stubbornly refused to sign the oil agreement, complaining of the meagre 5% oil royalty. Mustapha requested for 10 to 20% oil royalty; otherwise, he would threaten to pull Sabah out of Malaysia. Tengku Razaleigh refused to bulge in. The Malaysian federal government then made another deal with Datuk Harris Salleh (who was out of favour with Tun Mustapha) to establish Berjaya party and oust Tun Mustapha. However, Harris was reluctant to become the Chief Minister of Sabah, and Fuad Stephens was asked to assume to the post of chief minister if Berjaya were to come to power. Berjaya successfully ousted Tun Mustapha in the 1976 Sabah state election. One week after the 1976 air crash which killed the chief minister Fuad Stephens and other five state ministers, Harris signed the oil agreement. With Sabah entering the oil agreement, Petronas finally has total control of all oil and gas reserves in Malaysia.

Petronas first embarked on the oil exploration and production activities with the formation of Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd in 1978. In 1980, Petronas expanded its downstream businesses by setting up ASEAN Bintulu Fertiliser plant in Sarawak.

In 1984, Petronas moved to Dayabumi after occupying various buildings in Kuala Lumpur.

===Late 1980s: Battling oil depletion===

Oil exploration was by no means at an end and could yet produce more reserves. The Seligi field, which came onstream at the end of 1988 and was developed by Esso Production Malaysia, was one of the richest oilfields so far found in Malaysia waters, and further concessions to the majors would encourage exploration of the deeper waters around Malaysia, where unknown reserves could be discovered. Meanwhile, computerised seismography made it both feasible and commercially justifiable to re-explore fields which had been abandoned, or were assumed to be unproductive, over the past century. In 1990, Petronas invited foreign companies to re-explore parts of the sea off Sabah and Sarawak on the basis of new surveys using up-to-date techniques.

Another way to postpone depletion was to develop sources of oil, and of its substitute, natural gas, outside Malaysia. Late in 1989, the governments of Vietnam and Myanmar (Burma) invited Petronas Carigali to take part in joint ventures to explore for oil in their coastal waters. In 1990, a new unit, Petronas Carigali Overseas Sdn Bhd, was created to take up a 15% interest in a field in Myanmar&#x27;s waters being explored by Idemitsu Myanmar Oil Exploration Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the Japanese firm Idemitsu Oil Development Co. Ltd., in a production sharing arrangement with Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise. Thus began Petronas&#x27; first oil exploration outside Malaysia. In May 1990, the governments of Malaysia and Thailand settled a long-running dispute over their respective rights to an area of 7,300 square kilometres in the Gulf of Thailand by setting up a joint administrative authority for the area and encouraging a joint oil exploration project by Petronas, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, and the US company Triton Oil. In a separate deal, in October 1990, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand arranged with Petronas to study the feasibility of transferring natural gas from this jointly administered area, through Malaysia to Thailand, by way of an extension of the pipelines laid for the third stage of the Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project.

That project was on course to becoming a major element in the postponement of oil depletion. Contracts for line pipes for the second stage of the project were signed in 1989 with two consortia of Malaysian, Japanese, and Brazilian companies. This stage, completed in 1991, included the laying of 730 kilometres of pipeline through to the tip of the Peninsula, from where gas could be sold to Singapore and Thailand; the conversion of two power stations—Port Dickson and Pasir Gudang—from oil to gas; and the expansion of Petronas&#x27; output of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), propylene, and polypropylene, which were already being produced in joint ventures with Idemitsu Petrochemical Co. of Japan and Neste Oy of Finland. The third and final stage of the project was to lay pipelines along the northwest and northeast coastlines of the Peninsula and was completed in 1997.

Another new venture in 1990 was in ship-owning, since Petronas&#x27; existing arrangements with MISC and with Nigeria&#x27;s state oil company would be inadequate to transport the additional exports of LNG due to start in 1994, under the contract with Saibu Gas. Petronas did not lose sight of the government&#x27;s commitment to Malaysian self-reliance, and the company&#x27;s second refinery at Malacca, completed in 1994, with a capacity of , promoted the same policy. The fact that it was built in a joint venture with Samsung of Korea, the Chinese Petroleum Corporation of Taiwan, and Caltex of the United States did not negate the policy, for the subsidiary company Petronas Penapisan (Melaka) had a decisive 45% of equity while sharing the enormous costs of and gaining advanced technology for the project. More to the point, a side effect of the refinery&#x27;s completion was that Petronas was able to refine all of the crude oil it produced, instead of being partially dependent on refining facilities in Singapore.

Petronas, with its policies of promoting self-reliance, helping to develop associated industries, and varying the sources and uses of oil and gas, played an important role in the Malaysian economy as a whole. Under governments which—by current, if not historical, Western standards—were strongly interventionist, the contribution of oil taxes to the federal government&#x27;s revenue hovered at around 12% to 16% until 1980, when it showed a marked increase to 23%, followed by another leap to 32% in 1981. From then until 1988 the proportion fluctuated between 29% and 36%. Petronas was not just another big oil company: it controlled a crucial sector of the economy and remained, for better or worse, an indispensable instrument of the state.

===Since 1990s: Global expansion===

During the mid- to late 1990s, international exploration, development, and production remained key components in Petronas&#x27; strategy along with diversification. A key discovery was made in the Ruby field in Vietnam in 1994. That year, the firm also saw its first overseas production from the Dai Hung field in Vietnam and established its first retail station outside of Malaysia in Cambodia. In 1995, a subsidiary was created to import, store, and distribute liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In addition, the company&#x27;s polyethylene plant in Kerteh began operations. Petronas marked a significant milestone during this time period—two of its subsidiaries, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and Petronas Gas Bhd, went public on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. Between 1993 and 1996, it purchased the former sub-Saharan branch of Mobil Oil, rebranded as Engen Petroleum.

In 1996, Petronas entered the aromatics market by way of a joint venture that created Aromatics Malaysia Sdn Bhd. It also formed a contract with China National Offshore Oil Corporation and Chevron Overseas Petroleum Ltd. to begin the exploration of block 02/31 of the Liaodong Bay area in China. While the Asian economy as a whole suffered from an economic crisis during 1997 and 1998, Malaysia was quick to bounce back due to successful government reforms. From its new headquarters in the Petronas Twin Towers, the state-owned concern continued its development in the oil and gas industry.

During 1997, Petronas heightened its diversification efforts. The firm set plans in motion to build three petrochemical plants in Kuantan as well as an acetic facility in Kerteh. Its first LPG joint venture in China was launched that year, and the company acquired a 29.3% interest in Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad (MISC). In 1998, Petronas&#x27; tanker-related subsidiary merged with MISC, increasing Petronas&#x27; stake in MISC to 62%. That year, Petronas introduced the Petronas E01, the country&#x27;s first commercial prototype engine. The company also signed a total of five new production sharing contracts (PSCs) in 1998 and 1999, and began oil production in the Sirri field in Iran.

Petronas entered the new century determined to expand its international efforts. The company forged deals for two new exploration plots in Pakistan and began construction on the Chad-Cameroon Integrated Oil Development and Pipeline Project. By 2002, Petronas had signed seven new PSCs and secured stakes in eight exploration blocks in eight countries, including Gabon, Cameroon, Niger, Egypt, Yemen, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The firm also made considerable progress in its petrochemicals strategy, opening new gas-based petrochemical facilities in Kerteh and Gebeng.

By 2003, Malaysia was set to usurp Algeria as the world&#x27;s second-largest producer of LNG with the completion of the Malaysia LNG Tiga Plant. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad commented on the achievement in a May 2003 Bernama News Agency article, claiming that &quot;the Petronas LNG complex now serves as another shining example of a vision realized of a national aspiration, transformed into reality by the same belief among Malaysians that &#x27;we can do it.&#x27;&quot; Indeed, Petronas had transformed itself into a global oil company over the previous decade, becoming a national symbol for success. The company realised, however, that it would have to continue its aggressive growth strategy to ensure its survival in the years to come.

The Petronas overseas expansion drive continues with the acquisition of Woodside Energy Ltd Mauritania assets for $418 million in 2007. The venture proved successful as they discovered oil in May 2008

In 2004, Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, Datuk Mustapa Mohamed, stated that Petronas contributed RM 25 Billion to the country&#x27;s treasury accounting for 25% of revenue collected via dividends and other revenues. Petronas continued to focus on international exploration projects as 40% of revenue in 2008 was derived from international projects such as Iran, Sudan, Chad and Mauritania. The company&#x27;s international reserves stood at 6.24 billion barrels oil equivalent in 2008. On 9 April 2019, Petronas was praised for its role in the Sudanese oil and gas industry by Minister of Oil and Gas engineer Yagoub Adam Bashir Gamaa.

On 29 October 2012, Petronas sources said it would renew a bid for gas producer, Progress Energy Resources after Canada blocked its bid earlier that month. The $6-billion bid was approved by Ottawa on 7 December 2012.

On 17 January 2013, Petronas issued a statement that an onshore oil and gas discovery has been made in the state after drilling a test well about 20 kilometres away from the city of Miri in northern Sarawak. The well was found to have a net hydrocarbon thickness of 349 meters. It had flow rates of 440 barrels of crude oil per day and 11.5 million standard cubic feet of gas per day. The find is the first onshore oil discovery in Malaysia in 24 years.
On 2 May 2015, Petronas completed its acquisition of oil and gas assets in Azerbaijan from Norway&#x27;s Statoil (now Equinor) for US$2.25 billion.

Plagued by the 2010s oil glut, Petronas reported on 26 February 2015 that it cut its 2015 capital expenditures budget after reporting a $2 billion fourth quarter loss, the company&#x27;s first loss since it began reporting quarterly results five years ago.

On 1 April 2017, Petronas&#x27; PFLNG Satu, is the world&#x27;s first floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, has achieved a new milestone with the successful loading of its first cargo at the Kanowit gas field, offshore Bintulu, Sarawak.

On 25 July 2017, Petronas cancelled a $36-billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, the Pacific Northwest LNG, which was considered ambitious and a priority in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Both the company and the province blamed poor global LNG market conditions.

== Controversies ==

===War crimes allegations in Sudan===
In June 2010, the European Coalition on Oil in Sudan (ECOS) published the report &quot;Unpaid Debt&quot;, that called upon the governments of Sweden, Austria, and Malaysia to look into allegations that PETRONAS, Fida Aziz, Lundin Petroleum, and OMV may have been complicit in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity while operating in Block 5A, South Sudan (then Sudan), during the period 1997–2003. The reported crimes include indiscriminate attacks and intentional targeting of civilians, burning of shelters, pillage, destruction of objects necessary for survival, unlawful killing of civilians, rape of women, abduction of children, torture, and forced displacement. When the consortium that PETRONAS took part in operated in Block 5A, approximately 12,000 people died, and 160,000 were violently displaced from their land and homes, many forever. Satellite pictures taken between 1994 and 2003 show that the activities of PETRONAS in Sudan coincided with a spectacular drop in agricultural land use in its concession area.

In June 2010, the Swedish public prosecutor for international crimes opened a criminal investigation into links between Sweden and the reported crimes. In 2016, Lundin Petroleum&#x27;s Chairman Ian Lundin and CEO Alex Schneiter were informed that they were the suspects of the investigation. Sweden&#x27;s Government gave the green light for the Public Prosecutor in October 2018 to indict the two top executives On 1 November 2018, and the Swedish Prosecution Authority notified Lundin Petroleum AB that the company might be liable to a corporate fine and forfeiture of economic benefits of SEK 3,285 million (app. €315 million) for involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Consequently, the company itself will also be charged, albeit indirectly, and will be legally represented in court. On 15 November 2018, the suspects were served with the draft charges and the case files. They will be indicted for aiding and abetting international crimes and may face life imprisonment if found guilty. The trial is likely to begin early in 2022 and may take two years.

The Swedish war crimes investigation raises the issue of access to remedy and reparation for victims of human rights violations linked with business activities. In May 2016, representatives of communities in Block 5A claimed their right to remedy and reparation and called upon PETRONAS and its shareholders to pay off their debt to them. A conviction in Sweden may provide some level of remedy and reparation for the few victims of human rights violations who will testify in court, but not for the other 200,000 victims who will not be represented in court. The Swedish court cannot impose obligations upon PETRONAS.

On 23 May 2019, the T.M.C. Asser Institute for International Law in The Hague organised the conference &#x27;Towards criminal liability of corporations for human rights violations: The Lundin case in Sweden&#x27;.

The international standard for business and human rights, the UNGP, underlines the duty of business enterprises to contribute to effective remedy of the adverse impact that it has caused or contributed to. The company has never publicly showed an interest in the adverse effects of its activities on the communities in its concession area. According to the Dutch peace organisation PAX, PETRONAS, Lundin Petroleum, OMV, as well as their shareholders are disregarding the human rights standards that they claim to respect, because they,
&quot;A&quot;. never conducted appropriate due diligence for their Sudanese operations;
&quot;B&quot;. made no effort to know their human rights impacts; and
&quot;C&quot;. do not show how they address alleged adverse human rights impacts.

PETRONAS Carigali Overseas Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of PETRONAS Group of Companies, held a 28.5% share in the consortium that acquired the right to explore and develop oil deposits in Block 5A. In 2003, Lundin Petroleum and OMV sold their interest following a public outcry about the role of the consortium in Sudan&#x27;s oil war. PETRONAS picked up Lundin&#x27;s 40.375% working interest for a cash payment of US$142.5 million. As the operator of the consortium, Lundin Petroleum was responsible for day-to-day management. Still, it stood under the supervision of the Operating Committee, that exercised &quot;overall direction and control of all matters pertaining to the Joint Operations and the Joint Property&quot;. PETRONAS was permanently represented in the Operating Committee and has never publicly distanced itself from any of its decisions.

PETRONAS has never publicly responded to the allegations of negative impacts in Sudan or discussed the issue with local communities. The company is not known to have taken adequate measures to prevent involvement in human rights violations during the oil war or to undo the adverse impacts of its consortium&#x27;s operations.

PETRONAS was a loyal participant in the consortium that operated in Block 5A and had a substantial say in the way it operated. Therefore, the suspicions against the consortium&#x27;s top managers also concern PETRONAS. The company is wholly owned by the Malaysian State. According to the UN Guiding Principles, abuse of human rights by a business enterprise that is wholly or partially controlled by a State, may entail a violation of that State&#x27;s own international law obligations.

In early October 2021, the Sudanese transitional government made moves to confiscate PETRONAS&#x27; assets, alleging that they had been acquired through illegal means under the rule of ousted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. On 11 October, the Sudanese transitional government issued an arrest warrant for PETRONAS&#x27;s country manager. In response, the Malaysian Government summoned the Sudanese charge d&#x27;affaires and urged the Sudanese government to honour the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Treaty and to respect the sanctity of the Malaysian Embassy, which was housed in the same complex as the PETRONAS Sudan Complex in Khartoum. PETRONAS has also sought to cancel the manager&#x27;s arrest warrant and submitted a request for arbitration at the World Bank&#x27;s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Middle East Monitor contributor Nasim Ahmed opined that the Sudanese government&#x27;s actions against Malaysian, Turkish, Qatari and Chinese companies were part of a foreign policy shift to court Western investors. Former federal counsel and University of Technology Malaysia visiting professor Salleh Buang opined that the Sudanese government&#x27;s actions violated international law on the undue expropriation of commercial assets without adequate compensation, citing the 1927 Chorzów Factory case.

===2022 seizure of Luxembourg assets===

In February 2022, a French arbitration court known as the &quot;Tribunal de grande instance de Paris&quot; ordered the Malaysian Government to pay at least US$14.9 billion (RM 62.59 billion) to the descendants of the Sultanate of Sulu, who have laid claim to the Malaysian state of Sabah. To enforce the award, the claimants filed a &quot;saisie-arret&quot; (seize order) on 11 July 2022 for Luxembourg authorities to seize two Luxembourg-based subsidiaries of PETRONAS: PETRONAS Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz) and PETRONAS South Caucasus units. The descendants&#x27; territorial claim to Sabah dated back to an 1878 agreement between Baron Gustav Overbeck and Alfred Dent of the British North Borneo Company and the-then Sultan of Sulu Jamal Al Alam of Sulu. While the British and Malaysian Governments claimed that the Sultan had permanently ceded North Borneo, the descendants of the Sultan and the Philippines Government have contended that the Sultan had merely leased the territory. Until 2013, the Malaysian Government had paid eight claimants to the Sultanate of Sulu an annual rent of RM5,300. Following the 2013 Lahad Datu standoff, the Malaysian Government had terminated the annual stipends; prompting these descendants to pursue legal action.

On 13 July, the Malaysian Government obtained a stay on the French court&#x27;s ruling, with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob stating that the ruling undermined Malaysian sovereignty. In addition, PETRONAS described the seize order as &quot;baseless&quot; and stated it would contest the enforcement actions. It also stated that the two affected subsidiaries had already divested their assets in Azerbaijan and repatriated all their proceeds. On 18 July, Malaysian opposition politicians unsuccessfully demanded a debate on the seizure order against PETRONAS&#x27; assets in the Malaysian Parliament but were blocked by the Speaker of the House on procedural grounds. Law Minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar stated that the stay would prevent the final award from being enforced in any county until a final decision by the French court regarding the Malaysian government&#x27;s application that the February court ruling be cancelled. By contrast, lawyers representing the Sultanate of Sulu claimants contended that the stay on the award was only valid in France and remained enforceable in other international jurisdictions, citing a United Nations treaty on international arbitration.

In September 2022, the heirs asked the Hague Court of Appeal to recognise and enforce the award in the Netherlands, and allow them to seize Malaysian assets to this end. They attempted to do the same in France and Luxembourg.

In January 2023, a Luxembourg court reportedly set aside the heirs&#x27; request to enforce the $15 billion arbitration award. However, shortly after, a Luxembourg district court issued new orders to seize holdings and assets belonging to Petronas in mid-February. Petronas has two holding companies in Luxembourg called Petronas Azerbaijan and Petronas South Caucasus which are related to the state-owned oil company&#x27;s activities around the Caspian sea. Petronas confirmed the new seizure order for the two units and their parent company, but reiterated the heirs&#x27; actions were baseless and that the company will continue to defend its legal position.

On 14 March, the Paris Court of Appeal ruled that Sulu claimants&#x27; challenge to a stay order filed by Malaysia last year was &quot;inadmissible&quot;. The court handed another &quot;decisive victory&quot; to Malaysia on 4 June, when it found that the arbitral tribunal that had heard the petition filed by the Sulu heirs did not have jurisdiction over the case. According to the Malaysian Law Minister, this judgement implied that the Paris Court of Appeal will also annual the $14.9 billion award handed down earlier. On the other hand, the claimants said they would now consider their options before the French Supreme Court.

On 27 June, Malaysia won another legal victory, with the Hague Court of Appeal dismissing a bid to enforce the $15 billion award. According to Reuters, the Dutch judges sided with Malaysia, saying the original pact lacked a clause binding parties to arbitration and the French stay meant the claim was not enforceable in the Netherlands. While lawyer Paul Cohen, acting for the Sulu heirs, said they were disappointed with the court decision, Malaysia&#x27;s Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, welcomed the decision, stating, &quot;Malaysia trusts that today&#x27;s decision ... will put an end to the frivolous attempts of the claimants to enforce the purported final award in other jurisdiction&quot;.

On 8 January 2023, it was announced that Gonzalo Stampa, the Spanish arbitrator who had awarded the arbitral sum against Malaysia, had been convicted of contempt of court for &quot;knowingly disobeying rulings and orders from the Madrid High Court of Justice&quot;, and sentenced to six months in prison.

According to Law360, the Spanish courts&#x27; decision to move ahead with criminal proceedings against Stampa is a significant &quot;victory for the Malaysian government&quot;.

On 5 January 2024, Stampa was convicted for contempt of court. He was sentenced to six months in prison and banned from acting as an arbitrator for one year for &quot;knowingly disobeying rulings and orders from the Madrid High Court of Justice&quot;.

On 17 May 2024 the Madrid Court of Appeal upheld the contempt of court conviction and sentence against Stampa, upholding his six-month prison sentence, and a one-year ban from practising as an arbitrator.

On 30 May 2024, Petronas moved a Manhattan court to seek directions for litigation funding firm Therium and its parent company to turn over subpoenaed financial documents and communications. Petronas&#x27; Azerbaijani arm said it would sue the companies and their lawyers in Spain over losses from the seizure of assets in Luxembourg.

On 7 November 2024, the French Court of Cassation—the highest court in the French judicial system—annulled a $15 billion arbitration ruling against Malaysia. This decision marked a significant legal victory for Malaysia and reinforced its sovereignty in a dispute with the self-proclaimed Sulu heirs. The ruling highlighted irregularities in the arbitration process led by Gonzalo Stampa and raised concerns about practices such as forum shopping and unregulated litigation funding in European courts. 

The French court&#x27;s decision was deemed a significant &quot;win&quot; for Malaysia that effectively marked the end of the Sulu case by several publications, including Law.com and Law360.  Keith Ellison, former vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Minnesota attorney general, pointed out that the case highlighted the enormous scope for &quot;corruption,&quot; irresponsible profiteering, and foreign influence operations to subvert arbitration proceedings&quot;.

==Corporate affairs==
PETRONAS is a legal entity incorporated under the Malaysian Companies Act and reports to the company&#x27;s Board of Directors. The Malaysian federal government is the sole shareholder of the company. Key positions in the company are all appointees from the federal government. The federal government also controls the amount of dividend payout to finance the yearly budget of the country. In December 2019, prime minister Mahathir Mohamad mooted an idea of selling a percentage of PETRONAS stake to Sabah and Sarawak because the Pakatan Harapan government was unable to fulfill its promise of giving 20% oil royalty to both the states. The price of the purchase was reported to be RM 8 billion for one per cent of the company. Such proposal met cold response from Sarawak. This is because once the shares are bought, Sarawak can only become a minority shareholder. Sarawak therefore would not have much voice in the PETRONAS board meetings. Due to its high share price, the money, once invested, may have difficulty to break even in the future. A lawmaker from Sarawak stated that PETRONAS acts as a trustee for the oil and gas fields in both the states; therefore, it makes no sense of buying a property that should have been already owned by the state governments. The brand valuation of PETRONAS as of January 2021 was US$12 billion (RM 48 billion according to conversion rate of US$1.00 to RM 4.00). Total stockholder equity as of February 2021 was US$82 billion (RM 328 billion).

===Production sharing contracts===
Production-sharing contract (PSC) was signed between PETRONAS and other foreign oil companies in 1976. A ratio of 70:30 was agreed upon where for total amount of oil produced, other oil companies will take 20% of oil for cost recovery (cost oil), and the remaining 10% will be taken as oil royalty and shared equally between federal and respective state governments. The remaining 70% of oil (profit oil) will be divided again according to 70:30 formula where PETRONAS will take 70% and 30% goes to respective oil companies. Both PETRONAS and other oil companies will be subjected to 45% income tax by the federal government. Besides, 70% of any increase in oil price from the base price of US$12.72 will go to PETRONAS and the base price will increase by 5% each year so other oil companies will be able to cover for any cost inflation. In return, PETRONAS will not take over the equity of other oil companies. Each oil company will contribute 0.5% for a petroleum research fund.

Another PSC (the deep-water model) was developed in 1985 to attract other oil companies to enter the Malaysian oil mining scene, while taking into account the rising cost of oil exploration (cost oil of 28%). Sharing of oil revenue become more flexible, depending upon the depth of the oil is found. The deeper the oil seeps (from 200 meters to more than 1 km), the higher the cost oil (50 to 75%). However, foreign oil companies will get higher share of profit oil (from 30 to 85%) in deep-water oil mining.

In 1997, revenue over cost (R/C) model was adopted for PSC. PETRONAS will get higher share of profit oil as R/C ratio increases. In the meantime, 10% oil royalty stays the same throughout the years. Overall, PETRONAS earns 13.3% on R/C model and 12.5% on deep-water model. Meanwhile, the federal government earns 37% in R/C model and 25% in deep-water model.

===Finances===
PETRONAS has been publishing its financial reports online since 2008. However, certain quarters demanded detailed profit and loss accounts and reports on PSCs with other companies for transparency instead of just providing a summary of profits before tax. Responding to allegations of public funds mismanagement, PETRONAS responded that its profits are managed by the Malaysian federal government, not by the company itself.

In 2007, PETRONAS revenue come from petroleum exports from Malaysia (50%), domestic operations (20%) and international operations (30%). The weightage of the revenue streams were similar in 2020, where international operations accounted for 33% of total revenue received by PETRONAS.

PETRONAS continuously provides the Malaysian government dividends from its profits. Since its inception in 1974, PETRONAS have paid the government RM 403.3 billion, with RM 67.6 billion in 2008. The payment represents 44% of the 2008 federal government revenue. PETRONAS paid RM 54 billion in dividends to the federal government in 2019. In 2022, PETRONAS contributed RM 50 billion to the federal government.

=== Corporate identity ===

Petronas&#x27;s logo was created in 1974 by Dato Johan Ariff of Johan Design Associates.

On 22 July 2013, Petronas unveiled a refreshed version of its corporate logo in that year&#x27;s Asia Oil and Gas Conference, symbolising the growth and progression of its brand. It is the third iteration of the logo.

==Motorsport==

===Car racing===
PETRONAS was one of the main sponsors of the BMW Sauber Formula One team alongside Intel, and supplied lubricants and fuel to the team. It also owned 40% of Sauber PETRONAS Engineering, the company that builds chassis which formerly used Ferrari designed engines used by the Sauber team, until being bought out by German motor company BMW. PETRONAS was also the main sponsor for the Malaysian Grand Prix, and co-sponsored the Chinese Grand Prix, and the inaugural Korean Grand Prix. PETRONAS was the exclusive premium partner of the Sauber PETRONAS (1995–2005) and BMW Sauber (2006–2009) F1 teams. BMW had acquired the controlling stake of the former Sauber PETRONAS Engineering, but left the sport after the 2009 season. On 21 December 2009, PETRONAS was confirmed as moving from BMW Sauber to the newly formed Mercedes AMG PETRONAS Formula One team.
In terms of further Formula One involvement, every year PETRONAS took the BMW Sauber team to various parts of Malaysia for F1 demos, so the public who are unable to go to the track itself get to experience a little bit of what F1 offers. Other promotional events are held in the run up to the race and the drivers play an integral part in this so much so that Nick Heidfeld conceded that there were more fans for BMW Sauber in Malaysia than in most other countries.
PETRONAS also sponsors many other sporting events and teams, mostly motorsports. Some of these sponsorships include the PERT (PETRONAS EON Rally Team), and also the PETRONAS Adventure Team, a 4X4 adventure team. More recently PETRONAS was also a major sponsor for PETRONAS TOYOTA TEAM TOM&#x27;S which was participating in Super GT series, which they won the team title in 2008 and driver title in 2009. The series also raced in Malaysia every season at Sepang International Circuit between 2005 and 2013. PETRONAS signed a three-year sponsorship agreement with Yamaha MotoGP team. The PETRONAS branding can be seen starting Qatar race on the 10 to 12 April 2009. PETRONAS also sponsors all Mercedes-AMG DTM cars from the 2011 season until Mercedes&#x27; DTM exit in 2018 (replacing Mobil 1) for only providing the lubricants.

Since 2010, PETRONAS has been the main sponsor of the Mercedes AMG PETRONAS F1 team. Mercedes have won eight straight Constructors&#x27; Championship titles and 7 Drivers&#x27; Championship titles from the beginning of the 1.6 litre (97.6 cu in) turbocharged V6 engine era in until . Since 2014, PETRONAS has also been supplying fuel and lubricants for Mercedes-AMG customer teams, including Force India (from 2014) (now known as Aston Martin, along with Ravenol from 2018 season for lubricants only), Lotus for , Manor for , Williams from to 2022 and McLaren from . In addition PETRONAS also supplies fuels and lubricants for Honda-powered Red Bull-owned Italian team Scuderia Toro Rosso, known as Scuderia AlphaTauri since the 2018 season, until 2023. PETRONAS&#x27; title and technical partnership with Mercedes is extended from the 2026 season onwards.

===Motorcycle racing===
In 1996, PETRONAS sponsored a Grand Prix motorcycle racing team called PETRONAS Sprinta TVK in the 250cc class with Yamaha as the manufacturer. The team got a wildcard opportunity at the Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix with Shahrol Yuzy as its rider. In the following season in 1997, the team received another wildcard and raced in the 125cc class. This time Honda was chosen as the manufacturer. Then two seasons later, PETRONAS Sprinta TVK returned to the 250cc class. From 2000 to 2002, the team competed for a full season in the 250cc class on Yamaha bikes.

PETRONAS also sponsors the Malaysian Cub Prix races, and the now-defunct Foggy PETRONAS Superbike team (in which PETRONAS debuts their superbike, the FP1). Then, PETRONAS became a team sponsor in the Moto2 championship in the 2011 season called the PETRONAS Malaysia Team with Hafizh Syahrin as the rider and using the Moriwaki motorcycle. Then in the 2012 season, PETRONAS became the sponsor of the Malaysian Raceline Team when he received a wildcard at the Malaysian Sepang Grand Prix with Hafizh Syahrin, who at that time switched to using an FTR motorcycle. It was in this season that Syahrin managed to get on the podium for the first time. The team then got another wildcard in the following season, until in the 2014-2017 season, the team participated in full competition in the season with Kalex as the manufacturer.

Since 2017, PETRONAS has been the main sponsor of the Sepang Racing Team, which at that time competed in the Moto2 and Moto3 classes and was named PETRONAS Sprinta Racing. In the Moto3 class the team uses Honda bikes, while in Moto2 it uses Kalex. At 2019, PETRONAS is the main sponsor of the new PETRONAS Yamaha SRT, which became the satellite team for Yamaha in MotoGP following Tech3&#x27;s switch to KTM bikes after 20 years with Yamaha bikes. Their riders are Valentino Rossi and 2017 Moto2 World Champion Franco Morbidelli. In addition, PETRONAS also played a role for supplying fuels, motorcycle oil and other products for PETRONAS Yamaha SRT MotoGP team. But unfortunately, at the end of the 2021 season, PETRONAS did not continue its cooperation to become the main sponsor of the SRT team.

In 2022, PETRONAS returned as a team sponsor in Moto2 with their wildcard riders Kasma Daniel in the PETRONAS MIE Racing team and Azroy Anuar with the PETRONAS RW Racing team. Both riders compete in the Malaysian series.

From 2023, PETRONAS became the title sponsor of a World Superbike and World Supersport racing team, MIE Honda Racing and changed its name to PETRONAS MIE Honda Racing Team. Their riders are Hafizh Syahrin &amp; Eric Granado for WSBK category, and Adam Norrodin &amp; Tarran Mackenzie for WSSP category at this season.

As part of its corporate social responsibility programme, PETRONAS also brings underprivileged children to watch the races.

==Automotive manufacturers==
Petronas once developed its own race bike. Initially, this racing bike will be fielded in the WorldSBK racing event. The desire began in 2002, when Petronas was already a partner of the Sauber racing team in Formula 1. The base used was the Petronas GP1, which was originally prepared to go down in MotoGP. But, it was changed to pass WorldSBK homologation. For its development, Petronas worked with Suter Racing Technology. The Petronas FP1 is ready for mass production, to meet WorldSBK regulations.

Petronas is working with MSX International in the UK to make 75 units of the road version of the FP1. The remaining 75 units are made by Modenas, a Malaysian motorcycle brand. In terms of specifications, this bike is quite powerful. It uses an in-line 3-cylinder engine, DOHC, 4 valves per cylinder, with a capacity of 899.5 cc, and liquid-cooled. The engine produces 127.4 tk of power at 10,000 rpm and 92 Nm of torque at 9,700 rpm.

Petronas had formed the Foggy Petronas Racing team to compete in WorldSBK. The team is led by Carl Fogarty, a former legendary WorldSBK rider. For the riders, Troy Corser, Chris Walker, and Garry McCoy were selected.

However, during the 5 years the team competed in WorldSBK, Petronas FP1 was less competitive. One of the reasons was the change in regulations in 2003. Previously, 3-cylinder engines were limited to 900 cc. But, it was revised to 1,000 cc. Thus, the Petronas FP1 engine was quite defeated in terms of power. It was also not uncommon for the bike to experience technical problems. Even so, the bike made it to the podium three times. One of them was achieved by Walker when he finished third in the 2004 Valencia WorlsSBK. Corser has also achieved pole position twice.

The project was eventually discontinued in 2006 by Fogarty and Petronas. Until now, the road version of the Petronas FP1 has also been a question mark. Because, the motorcycle is difficult to detect its whereabouts now.

==Education==

PETRONAS bestows educational sponsorships in the form of convertible loans upon both Malaysian and international students, facilitating their pursuit of higher education at local or overseas universities. Overseeing educational matters is the Sponsorship &amp; Talent Sourcing Unit (STS), an arm of PETRONAS. These sponsorships are granted based on academic accomplishments, extracurricular involvements, family background, and an evaluation of the student&#x27;s character (assessed through the EduCamp program, mandatory for all aspiring PETRONAS scholars). Upon successful completion of their tertiary studies, scholars absorbed into PETRONAS have their convertible loans transformed into comprehensive scholarships. These scholars are contractually obliged to serve the company for a period of two years for each year of sponsorship. PETRONAS has its own research university, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP). Built in 1997, the campus is located in Seri Iskandar, Perak.

<text>Andrew Phillip Olexander (; born 26 February 1965) is a former Australian politician. He was a member of the Victorian Legislative Council representing Silvan Province from 1999 until 2006.

== Personal life ==
Olexander was born in the regional city of Geelong, and attended high school in Vermont. He studied economics at the University of Melbourne before pursuing a career in market research.

He became heavily involved with the Young Liberal movement, acting as its State President from 1989 to 1990. He also served on its Federal Policy Committee, as well as the broader party&#x27;s Federal Council during the same period.

In the late 1980s Olexander, who was of Hungarian and Ukrainian descent, helped form the &quot;Australian Chernobyl Children&#x27;s Relief Foundation&quot; which provided financial and medical help to victims of the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. He became the honorary inaugural secretary of that foundation in 1990.

Olexander is openly gay.

== Political career ==
In 1999, Olexander won pre-selection for the safe Liberal Legislative Council seat of Silvan Province, and was subsequently elected. After the Liberal Party&#x27;s defeat at the 2002 election, Olexander was promoted to the shadow ministry, taking on the portfolios of Youth, Arts and Consumer Affairs in December 2002. During 2002 to 2004, he also served on the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee.

In June 2006, Olexander was reported to have drafted a Private Member&#x27;s Bill that would allow gay civil unions in Victoria. The bill was not presented to the parliament.

Olexander threatened to run against Liberal members in the Eastern Metropolitan Region for the 2006 election, but ultimately did not nominate.

=== Controversies ===
In the early hours of 11 July 2004, Olexander had been drinking and was driving home when he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed his taxpayer funded car into four parked cars in Port Melbourne. He was fined $500 and lost his licence for 12 months.

Olexander was also investigated regarding his residence. He was claiming that his Ringwood East address was his primary residence, while claiming parliamentary expenses to stay at his Docklands apartment. The president of the Legislative Council was opened an inquiry in the claiming of these benefits from a number of members, including Olexander.

He attracted some attention in late 2004 for advocating for greater funding for gambling support groups and his criticism of the government&#x27;s backdown on their election promise to extend the Epping railway line to South Morang. He was ultimately forced to pay back the travel allowance that he was not entitled to.

On 7 January 2009, Olexander appeared before the Melbourne Magistrates&#x27; Court, accused of driving on the CityLink tollway three times without a pass. Magistrate Sharon Cure ordered Olexander pay a $100 fine on each of the three counts of using an unregistered vehicle on a tollway plus $40 in court costs.

=== Expulsion from the Liberal party ===
Following the car accident in 2004, the Liberal party considered expelling Olexander, however in late July the executive decided against expelling him. However, he was expected to regularly report to the state director, the only member of the Liberal&#x27;s parliamentary party that was expected to do so.

In late 2005, the question of expelling Olexander was raised again. Following his failed preselection bid, he publicly aired a series of attacks aimed at the party and its leader, Robert Doyle. Olexander claimed that the party had not earned the right to re-election, accused the party of being taken over by homophobic extremists. It was also claimed that he failed to show up to parliament and party room meetings. Olexander claimed that he was being silenced by the party leadership, and that Doyle wanted to remove him from the party because he would support an opponent in a leadership spill, but the party said that the motion to expel Olexander was because he brought the party into disrepute.

On 29 November Olexander was expelled from the Liberal party, although some, including Ted Baillieu, a potential challenger to Doyle voted against the expulsion. The Age commented on the expulsion that &quot;Mr Olexander must have known it would end like this... [he] should have accepted his party&#x27;s verdict with grace, acknowledging it as both inevitable and just. Instead, he lashed out, accusing the Liberals of bigotry and homophobia.&quot;

Olexander served out the remainder of his term in the Legislative Council sitting on the cross benches. After his parliamentary career ended, Olexander began working with Greens leader Adam Bandt.

<doc id="1123986" wikidata="Q588331" url="?curid=1123986" title="Chelsea Girl (album)">
<text>Chelsea Girl is the debut solo album and second studio album by German singer Nico. It was released in October 1967 by Verve Records and was recorded following Nico&#x27;s collaboration with the Velvet Underground on their 1967 debut studio album. &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; was produced by Tom Wilson, who added string and flute arrangements against the wishes of Nico. The title is a reference to Andy Warhol&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;, in which Nico starred.

Much of the album features instrumental work and songwriting credits from Velvet Underground members Lou Reed, Sterling Morrison, and John Cale. The song &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot; was written by Bob Dylan, while three songs are by Jackson Browne, who contributes guitar.

==Background==
After collaborating as a singer with the Velvet Underground on their debut &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; (recorded in 1966 and released in March of the following year), Warhol superstar Nico toured with the band in Andy Warhol&#x27;s Exploding Plastic Inevitable (EPI) multimedia roadshow. Before the EPI came to an end in 1967, Nico took up residence in a New York City coffeehouse as a solo folk chanteuse; accompanied in turn by guitarists, such as Tim Hardin, Jackson Browne, and also her Velvet Underground bandmates Lou Reed, Sterling Morrison and John Cale.

==Composition==
Some of the accompanists wrote songs for Nico to sing, and these form the backbone of &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;. Browne contributed &quot;The Fairest of the Seasons&quot;, &quot;These Days&quot;, and &quot;Somewhere There&#x27;s a Feather&quot;, while Hardin contributed &quot;Eulogy to Lenny Bruce&quot;. &quot;Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams&quot; by Lou Reed was part of the earliest Velvet Underground repertoire (which did not surface as a Velvet Underground recording until it was included in the 1995 box set &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot;), and Reed, Cale and Morrison in various combinations contributed four more songs. Additionally, Bob Dylan gave her one of his songs to record: &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot;.

Musically, &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; can be described as a cross between chamber folk and 1960s baroque pop. The musical backing is relatively simple, consisting of one or two guitars or, alternatively, a keyboard instrument, played by either Browne or (a combination of) her Velvet Underground colleagues, but there are no drums or bass instruments, hence the absence of Velvets drummer Maureen Tucker, and adding to the chamber folk feel of the music are the string and flute overdubs added to the initial recordings by producer Tom Wilson and arranger Larry Fallon without involving or consulting Nico.

==Legacy==

In retrospective 21st-century reviews, AllMusic described the album as &quot;an unqualified masterpiece&quot;, while &quot;Trouser Press&quot; commented that the album &quot;is sabotaged by tepid arrangements and weak production&quot; and is &quot;of interest mainly for its links to the band Nico had just left.&quot; &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; is listed the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, in which Mary Boukouvalas writes: &quot;The public were unprepared for Nico&#x27;s experimental 
art-rock masterpieces and their melancholic ambience, and the album made little impression upon release. But its desolate beauty — and Nico&#x27;s unique, provocative later work with John Cale — has fascinated subsequent generations&quot;, citing Patti Smith and Siouxsie Sioux as influenced artists.

Nico was dissatisfied with the finished product. Recalling the sessions in 1981, she stated:

===In popular culture===
Two tracks from the album – &quot;The Fairest of the Seasons&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot; – were used in Wes Anderson&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;. &quot;The Fairest of the Seasons&quot; was also used in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Restless&quot; and Yuri Kanchiku&#x27;s 2022 drama &quot;First Love&quot;. The song &quot;Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams&quot; was used in Andrew Dominik&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Killing Them Softly&quot;.

The Tallest Man on Earth recorded a version of &quot;The Fairest of the Seasons&quot; for his 2022 album of covers, &quot;Too Late for Edelweiss&quot;.

<text>Sea tulip is the common name of a few species of sessile ascidians (sea squirts) in the genus &quot;Pyura&quot; that live in coastal waters at depths of up to 80 m (260 feet).

Like all ascidians, sea tulips are filter feeders. Their common name comes from their appearance, consisting of a knobbly &#x27;bulb&#x27; or flower attached to a long stalk. Sea tulips come in a variety of colours, including white, pink, yellow, orange and purple. The colouration of sea tulips depends upon their association with a symbiotic sponge that covers their surface.

Despite their common name, sea tulips are animals and not plants.

Two examples of sea squirts known as sea tulips are &quot;P. pachydermatina&quot; and &quot;P. spinifera&quot;.

<text>The Mount is the Georgian house in Shrewsbury, England where Charles Darwin was born.

== Overview ==
The large Georgian house was built in 1800 by Charles Darwin&#x27;s father, the successful local doctor Robert Darwin. His son Charles was born there on 12 February 1809. Robert Darwin died in the house on 13 November 1848, followed by his unmarried daughters Catherine and Susan. Since there were no surviving members of the Darwin family in residence, the house was then put up for auction, after the three surviving Darwin children, Ras, Charles, and Caroline Wedgwood had taken what possessions they wished.

, the house is occupied by the District Valuer and Valuation Office of Shrewsbury, and visits may be made by appointment during office hours. The building is grade II* listed. The site is not recognized as a museum. However, Down House, in Bromley (London), where Darwin spent most of his adult life, is a museum.

In January 2018, a steering group was established by the Mayor of Shrewsbury, Councillor Jane Mackenzie, and led by Shrewsbury Town Council. Their purpose was to acquire Mount House and take it into public ownership, so that a visitor destination could be developed where Darwin&#x27;s contribution to science could be celebrated.

== Architecture ==
It is a building of the typical Georgian style, showing influences over the neoclassic movement. Built of local red brick, it has five bays. The central bay above the portico has a prominent window surround. The portico is large with a thick stone cornice and two doric pillars. All windows are sash windows and have brick surrounds. The house is composed of three stories that can be seen from the outside, with the smaller attic story at the top. There is a low-pitched roof with no dormers and a simple stone cornice in-between the roof and the bricks.

<doc id="1123994" wikidata="Q888073" url="?curid=1123994" title="LAN Manager">
<text>LAN Manager is a discontinued network operating system (NOS) available from multiple vendors and developed by Microsoft in cooperation with 3Com Corporation. It was designed to succeed 3Com&#x27;s 3+Share network server software which ran atop a heavily modified version of MS-DOS.

==History==
The LAN Manager OS/2 operating system was co-developed by IBM and Microsoft, using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. It originally used SMB atop either the NetBIOS Frames (NBF) protocol or a specialized version of the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocol. These legacy protocols had been inherited from previous products such as MS-Net for MS-DOS, Xenix-NET for MS-Xenix, and the afore-mentioned 3+Share. A version of LAN Manager for Unix-based systems called LAN Manager/X was also available. LAN Manager/X was the basis for Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Pathworks product for OpenVMS, Ultrix and Tru64.

In 1990, Microsoft announced LAN Manager 2.0 with a host of improvements, including support for TCP/IP as a transport protocol for SMB, using NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT). The last version of LAN Manager, 2.2, which included an MS-OS/2 1.31 base operating system, remained Microsoft&#x27;s strategic server system until the release of Windows NT Advanced Server in 1993.

===Versions===
* 1987 – MS LAN Manager 1.0 (Basic/Enhanced)
* 1989 – MS LAN Manager 1.1
* 1991 – MS LAN Manager 2.0
* 1992 – MS LAN Manager 2.1
* 1992 – MS LAN Manager 2.1a
* 1993 – MS LAN Manager 2.2
* 1994 – MS LAN Manager 2.2a

Many vendors shipped licensed versions, including:
* 3Com Corporation 3+Open
* HP LAN Manager/X
* IBM LAN Server
* Tapestry Torus
* The Santa Cruz Operation

==Password hashing algorithm== 
The LM hash is computed as follows:
# The user&#x27;s password is restricted to a maximum of fourteen characters.
# The user&#x27;s password is converted to uppercase.
# The user&#x27;s password is encoded in the System OEM code page.
# This password is NULL-padded to 14 bytes.
# The “fixed-length” password is split into two 7-byte halves.
# These values are used to create two DES keys, one from each 7-byte half, by converting the seven bytes into a bit stream with the most significant bit first, and inserting a parity bit after every seven bits (so codice_1 becomes codice_2). This generates the 64 bits needed for a DES key. (A DES key ostensibly consists of 64 bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. The parity bits added in this step are later discarded.)
# Each of the two keys is used to DES-encrypt the constant ASCII string “codice_3”, resulting in two 8-byte ciphertext values. The DES CipherMode should be set to ECB, and PaddingMode should be set to codice_4.
# These two ciphertext values are concatenated to form a 16-byte value, which is the LM hash.

==Security weaknesses==
LAN Manager authentication uses a particularly weak method of hashing a user&#x27;s password known as the LM hash algorithm, stemming from the mid-1980s when viruses transmitted by floppy disks were the major concern. Although it is based on DES, a well-studied block cipher, the LM hash has several weaknesses in its design.
This makes such hashes crackable in a matter of seconds using rainbow tables, or in a few minutes using brute force. Starting with Windows NT, it was replaced by NTLM, which is still vulnerable to rainbow tables, and brute force attacks unless long, unpredictable passwords are used, see password cracking. NTLM is used for logon with local accounts except on domain controllers since Windows Vista and later versions no longer maintain the LM hash by default. Kerberos is used in Active Directory Environments.

The major weaknesses of LAN Manager authentication protocol are:
# Password length is limited to a maximum of 14 characters chosen from the 95 ASCII printable characters.
# Passwords are not case sensitive. All passwords are converted into uppercase before generating the hash value. Hence LM hash treats PassWord, password, PaSsWoRd, PASSword and other similar combinations same as PASSWORD. This practice effectively reduces the LM hash key space to 69 characters.
# A 14-character password is broken into 7+7 characters and the hash is calculated for each half separately. This way of calculating the hash makes it dramatically easier to crack, as the attacker only needs to brute-force 7 characters twice instead of the full 14 characters. This makes the effective strength of a 14-character password equal to only formula_1, or twice that of a 7-character password, which is 3.7 trillion times less complex than the formula_2 theoretical strength of a 14-character single-case password. As of 2020, a computer equipped with a high-end graphics processor (GPUs) can compute 40 billion LM-hashes per second. At that rate, all 7-character passwords from the 95-character set can be tested and broken in half an hour; all 7-character alphanumeric passwords can be tested and broken in 2 seconds.
#If the password is 7 characters or less, then the second half of hash will always produce same constant value (0xAAD3B435B51404EE). Therefore, a password is less than or equal to 7 characters long can be identified visibly without using tools (though with high speed GPU attacks, this matters less).
# The hash value is sent to network servers without salting, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks such as replay the hash. Without salt, time–memory tradeoff pre-computed dictionary attacks, such as a rainbow table, are feasible. In 2003, Ophcrack, an implementation of the rainbow table technique, was published. It specifically targets the weaknesses of LM encryption, and includes pre-computed data sufficient to crack virtually all alphanumeric LM hashes in a few seconds. Many cracking tools, such as RainbowCrack, Hashcat, L0phtCrack and Cain, now incorporate similar attacks and make cracking of LM hashes fast and trivial.

==Workarounds==
To address the security weaknesses inherent in LM encryption and authentication schemes, Microsoft introduced the NTLMv1 protocol in 1993 with Windows NT 3.1. For hashing, NTLM uses Unicode support, replacing codice_5 by codice_6, which does not require any padding or truncating that would simplify the key. On the negative side, the same DES algorithm was used with only 56-bit encryption for the subsequent authentication steps, and there is still no salting. Furthermore, Windows machines were for many years configured by default to send and accept responses derived from both the LM hash and the NTLM hash, so the use of the NTLM hash provided no additional security while the weaker hash was still present. It also took time for artificial restrictions on password length in management tools such as User Manager to be lifted.

While LAN Manager is considered obsolete and current Windows operating systems use the stronger NTLMv2 or Kerberos authentication methods, Windows systems before Windows Vista/Windows Server 2008 enabled the LAN Manager hash by default for backward compatibility with legacy LAN Manager and Windows ME or earlier clients, or legacy NetBIOS-enabled applications. It has for many years been considered good security practice to disable the compromised LM and NTLMv1 authentication protocols where they aren&#x27;t needed.
Starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, Microsoft disabled the LM hash by default; the feature can be enabled for local accounts via a security policy setting, and for Active Directory accounts by applying the same setting via domain Group Policy. The same method can be used to turn the feature off in Windows 2000, Windows XP and NT. Users can also prevent a LM hash from being generated for their own password by using a password at least fifteen characters in length.—NTLM hashes have in turn become vulnerable in recent years to various attacks that effectively make them as weak today as LanMan hashes were back in 1998.

==Reasons for continued use of LM hash==
Many legacy third party SMB implementations have taken considerable time to add support for the stronger protocols that Microsoft has created to replace LM hashing because the open source communities supporting these libraries first had to reverse engineer the newer protocols—Samba took 5 years to add NTLMv2 support, while JCIFS took 10 years.

Poor patching regimes subsequent to software releases supporting the feature becoming available have contributed to some organisations continuing to use LM Hashing in their environments, even though the protocol is easily disabled in Active Directory itself.

Lastly, prior to the release of Windows Vista, many unattended build processes still used a DOS boot disk (instead of Windows PE) to start the installation of Windows using WINNT.EXE, something that requires LM hashing to be enabled for the legacy LAN Manager networking stack to work.

<text>Lilian Masediba Matabane Ngoyi, &quot;Mma Ngoyi&quot;, OMSG (25 September 1911 – 13 March 1980) was a South African anti-apartheid activist. She was the first woman elected to the executive committee of the African National Congress, and helped launch the Federation of South African Women.

Prior to becoming a machinist at a textile mill, where she was employed from 1945 to 1956, Ngoyi enrolled to become a nurse.

== Early life ==
Ngoyi was born in Bleared Street, Pretoria. She was the only daughter of Annie and Isaac Matabane, and three brothers, Lawrence, George and Percy. Her grandfather, on her mother&#x27;s side, was Johannes Mphahlele, a member of the royal Mphahlele household, who became a Methodist evangelist, working alongside Samuel Mathabathe. Ngoyi&#x27;s mother worked as a washerwoman and her father was a mineworker. Ngoyi attended Kilnerton Primary School until Standard Two.

In 1928, she moved to Johannesburg to train as a nurse at City Deep Mine Hospital, and completed three years of training in general nursing. During this time, she met and married a van driver, John Gerard Ngoyi, in 1934. They had a daughter, Edith Ngoyi. Lilian&#x27;s husband died in a motor car accident in 1937, after which she became a seamstress, working both from home and in garment factories at various times. From the 1950s onwards, she lived in Orlando, Soweto, with her mother and her children.

== Political activism ==
Having been drawn into politics via her work in the Garment Workers&#x27; Union of South Africa in the 1940s, Ngoyi joined the ANC Women&#x27;s League in 1952; she was at that stage a widow with children and an elderly mother to support, and worked as a seamstress. A year later she was elected as President of the Women&#x27;s League. In 1954, she helped to found the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW) and was elected to the national executive of the ANC; she was the first woman to be elected to national office in the organisation.

On 9 August 1956, Ngoyi led a women&#x27;s march along with Helen Joseph, Rahima Moosa, Sophia De Bruyn, Motlalepula Chabaku, Bertha Gxowa and Albertina Sisulu of 20,000 women to the Union Buildings of Pretoria in protest against the apartheid government requiring women to carry passbooks as part of the pass laws.

Lilian Ngoyi was also a transnational figure who recognised the potential influence that international support could have on the struggle against apartheid and the emancipation of black women. With this in mind she had, in 1955, embarked on an illegal journey to Lausanne, Switzerland, in order to participate in the World Congress of Mothers held by the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation (WIDF). Accompanied by her fellow activist Dora Tamana, and as an official delegate of FEDSAW, she embarked on a journey that would see an attempt to stow away on a boat leaving Cape Town under &quot;white names&quot;, defy (with the help of a sympathetic pilot) segregated seating on a plane bound for London and gain entry to Britain under the pretext of completing her course in Bible studies. She would visit England, Germany, Switzerland, Romania, China and Russia, meeting women leaders often engaged in left-wing politics, before arriving back in South Africa a wanted woman.

Ngoyi was known as a strong orator and a fiery inspiration to many of her colleagues in the ANC. She was among the 156 Treason Trialists arrested in December 1956, and was finally acquitted of the charges against her in 1960. She was rearrested more than once in the early 1960s, and spent 71 days in solitary confinement in 1963. Ngoyi spent a total of 15 years living under three five-year banning orders, which included restrictions that confined her to her home in Orlando, Soweto, and prevented her from meeting any other banned persons. Additional conditions of the banning orders included being forbidden to attend public gatherings, make speeches or be quoted; even at her own home, she was not permitted to be with more than one person at the same time. The first two banning orders were imposed in 1962 and 1967, and when the second banning order expired in 1972, she was able to meet colleagues and friends again, and travelled to Durban and Cape Town. In 1975, a banning order against her was imposed again; however, this time its conditions did allow her some communication with the outside world.

==Memorials and honours==
The Koos Beukes Clinic at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto has been renamed Lilian Ngoyi Community Clinic in her honour.

On 16 November 2004, the South African Ministry of the Environment launched the lead ship in a class of environmental patrol vessels named in her honour.

On 9 August 2006, the 50th anniversary of the march on Pretoria, Strijdom Square from which the women marched was renamed Lilian Ngoyi Square. 
9 August is commemorated in South Africa as Women&#x27;s Day.

In 2009, a residence hall at Rhodes University was renamed in her honour.

In 2012, Van der Walt Street in Pretoria was renamed Lilian Ngoyi Street. Other roads in Cape Town, Thembisa, Berea, Durban, and Hartbeesfontein have been named in her honour.

The City of Johannesburg decided to honor Mme Lilian Masediba Ngoyi by renaming the Bree Street in Johannesburg after her in 2014 – the street named Lilian Ngoyi Street.

<text>Zurab Azmaiparashvili (; born 16 March 1960) is a chess grandmaster from Georgia. His peak Elo rating was 2702, achieved in July 2003. He is currently, as of 2024, the president of the European Chess Union.

==Career==
Azmaiparashvili became a Grandmaster in 1988. Among his achievements are a 2810 performance rating at the 1998 Chess Olympiad and first-place finishes at Pavlodar 1982, Moscow 1986, Albena 1986, Tbilisi 1986, London (Lloyds Bank Open) 1989, and in the 2003 European Individual Chess Championship in Silivri. In 2010 he tied for 1st–2nd with IM Oliver Barbosa in the 1st ASEAN Chess Championship in Singapore, and won the event on tie-break.

Azmaiparashvili is active in chess politics. He is President of the European Chess Union and a vice-president of international chess federation FIDE.

In August 2009, he was appointed as captain of Azerbaijani chess team and won European Team Chess Championship in Novi Sad (Serbia).

==Controversies==
Azmaiparashvili was alleged to have rigged the results of the Strumica tournament of 1995 to boost his rating. The tournament, in which he played 18 rounds against significantly weaker opponents, is generally regarded as an illegitimate event. In 2003, Sveshnikov referred to the Azmaiparashvili incident and similar case involving Alexandru Crișan as &quot;open secrets&quot;, at a time when both purported culprits were heavily involved in FIDE politics.

In winning the 2003 European Championship in Istanbul, Azmaiparashvili retracted a move against Vladimir Malakhov (who subsequently finished second). By retracting his blunder and playing a sensible move, Azmaiparashvili won the game and the tournament. Malakhov could have enforced the rules but said that he was too shocked to react.

Azmaiparashvili made chess news in 2004 when, at the closing ceremony of the 36th Chess Olympiad in Calvià, he was arrested by local police and subsequently held in custody for several days. The attitude of the event&#x27;s organizers towards Azmaiparashvili had apparently been soured when, upon his arrival in Spain, he had attempted to secure himself two hotel rooms, claiming he was entitled to one in his capacity as a FIDE vice-president, and another as a player at the event. This sour mood seems to have brought him extra attention at the closing ceremony when he approached the stage, apparently in an attempt to inform FIDE officials that the organizers had neglected to award a prize named in honour of Georgian former Women&#x27;s World Champion Nona Gaprindashvili. He came into conflict with security officials, and a scuffle broke out resulting in injuries both to Azmaiparashvili and a security agent. There are conflicting claims about the exact nature of said scuffle: a press release from the Olympiad organizers placed the blame squarely on Azmaiparashvili&#x27;s shoulders, saying that after he had tried to gain admittance to the stage on several occasions he &quot;without any previous provocation, assaulted the agent with a head butt to his mouth&quot;. FIDE, on the other hand, blamed over-zealous policing, saying in their press release that &quot;Despite his clear VIP identification, he was severely beaten up by several security guards&quot;. Azmaiparashvili was due to appear in court on 22 July 2005, but all charges were dropped shortly beforehand.

Azmaiparashvili had been criticized earlier in 2004 over arrangements for the 2004 Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship when female Georgian players Lela Javakhishvili and Ana Matnadze accused him of behaving &quot;in a hostile and intimidating manner, using inappropriate and vulgar language and bringing to tears our mothers&quot;.

At the Chess World Cup 2017, where Azmaiparashvili was organizer, he berated player Anton Kovalyov for wearing shorts, racially abusing him with the slur &quot;gypsy&quot; and demanding that Kovalyov change ten minutes before his scheduled third-round game, leading to Kovalyov withdrawing from the tournament in response. Azmaiparashvili received heavy backlash from the global chess community for this incident, including a condemnation from the Association of Chess Professionals and calls from other players demanding that he be removed from his organization roles. In an interview with Chessbase India, Azmaiparashvili stood by his decision.

<doc id="1124008" wikidata="Q488315" url="?curid=1124008" title="Lustenau">
<text>Lustenau (; ) is a town in the westernmost Austrian state of Vorarlberg in the district of Dornbirn. It lies on the river Rhine, which forms the border with Switzerland. Lustenau is Vorarlberg&#x27;s fourth largest town.

==Geography==

Lustenau is located on the eastern bank of the Alpine Rhine, in the lower Vorarlberg Rhine Valley, which serves as the border with the Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. Its altitude is 404 meters above sea level. Because the town is located at the bottom of the Rhine Valley, there are no hills or mountains.
Lustenau is bordered to the west by the Rhine and to the northeast by the Dornbirner Ach. The territory stretches about 8.5 km from north to south, and about 4 km from east to west.

Four bridges connect Lustenau with Switzerland. The municipality is organised into four parishes, on which locals often refer to: Rotkreuz, Rheindorf, Kirchdorf and Hasenfeld.

As the church square in Lustenau is painted in blue, the village center is called &quot;Blue Square&quot; (German &quot;Blauer Platz&quot;).

==History==
The name Lustenau derives from a document from January 24 887, signed by the Carolingian king Charles the Fat, with the title &quot;Lustenauua curti regali,&quot; meaning &quot;Royal Court of Lustenau.&quot; In 1395 the Counts of Werdenberg pledged the Zwingenstein fortress and Lustenau to the Knights of Ems, and in 1526 the pledge was converted into a final purchase. After the male line of the Hohenems family died out in 1759, a decade-long dispute over ownership of Lustenau developed between Maria Theresa of Austria on the one hand and the Hohenems heiress Maria Rebekka on the other. Until 1830, Lustenau was an independent county ruled over by the &quot;Counts of Waldburg-Zeil-Lustenau-Hohenems.&quot; After 1830 it became part of Austria. During the German Reich, there is no evidence of any organized resistance against National Socialism in Lustenau. However, a large number of cases of individual opposition are documented, which were punished with arrests, with the delivery to a concentration camp or even with the death penalty. After the Second World War, local embroidery industry gave Lustenau an economic boom.

==Population==
The first census took place in 1750 and resulted in 1073 inhabitants. During large periods of its history, the municipality of Lustenau experienced much higher population growth than the average for Vorarlberg. In particular, the strong economic growth that began with the flourishing embroidery industry and the elimination of the flood problem at the end of the 19th century led to a strong migration movement to Lustenau, both from other municipalities in Vorarlberg and from the rest of Austria and southern Germany. A second wave of immigration in the 1950s and 1960s was triggered by the renewed strong economic upswing after the Second World War.
===Special Characteristics===
Due to its special political position as the Royal Court, Lustenau was comparatively isolated from its surroundings for centuries. It was not until 1837 that foreign men were accepted as citizens. Because of this, a distinctive dialect has developed and been preserved in Lustenau, which is recognizably different from the other Alemannic dialects of the surrounding area.

Another consequence of Lustenau&#x27;s centuries of independence is the dominance of a few family names, like &quot;Hämmerle&quot;, &quot;Grabherr&quot; and &quot;Bösch&quot;. The 1998 inhabitants counted in 1806 were distributed among only 19 family names, which were still born by 60% of the population in 1950. It is due to this circumstance that the use of house names from the 17th century until the late 20th century was even more pronounced in Lustenau than in the rest of Vorarlberg.

The town was formerly a major center of the embroidery industry in the past and is now a centre for the new technologies industry.
==Regular Events==
Every Summer, for more than 30 years, the culture and youth association &quot;Szene Lustenau&quot; organizes an open-air festival at the Rhine bank, called &quot;Szene Openair&quot;, the largest festival in Western Austria. The Event hosts international Artist, local bands, and attracts over 10 000 visitors from all over Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. More than 450 volunteers work for the festival.

The &quot;Kilbi&quot;, the parish fair of the parish St. Peter and Paul, is the largest fair in Vorarlberg. Every year on the 2nd Sunday in October, around 160 market stalls offer their goods at the church square. A temporary amusement park is set up for the Kilbi on the village square, with roller coasters, carousels, shooting ranges and many more. On the Saturday before the Kilbi, a party is organised called &quot;Kilbifest&quot;

== Transport ==
Lustenau railway station lies on the St. Margrethen–Lauterach line running between St. Margrethen in Switzerland and Bregenz. It is served by the S3 and R5 services of Vorarlberg S-Bahn. 

Lustenau is also home to the headquarters of the International Rhine Regulation Railway, a historic industrial railway that was formerly used in the development of dikes and extension of the Rhine out into the Lake of Constance.

==Sport==
Lustenau has a long and successful history in sports. The town&#x27;s two football teams, SC Austria Lustenau and FC Lustenau, play in major Austrian football leagues. The well-known and successful skier, Marc Girardelli, was born in Lustenau, and the Lustenau ice hockey team, EHC Lustenau, is part of the Austrian National League. FC Lustenau 07 and SC Austria Lustenau play, at varying levels, in the Austrian Football Bundesliga.

There are also two very good athletics and gymnastic clubs in Lustenau, the TS (Turnerschaft) Lustenau and the TS (Turnerschaft) Jahn Lustenau. Both have achieved top results nationally and internationally. They also have survived the domination of the football clubs, which led to a total demolition of the athletic track in the Reichshofstadion in 1998.

<doc id="1124011" wikidata="Q699612" url="?curid=1124011" title="Hard, Austria">
<text>Hard is a town in the west of the westernmost Austrian state of Vorarlberg, directly on the southern shores of Lake Constance.
Hard&#x27;s attractions include the Strandbad and the Grünerdamm.
Hard is also known for its skatepark.

An honorary consulate of Brazil is located in Hard.

==Population==

== Geography ==
Hard has an area of 17.46 km² (6.75 sq mi). Hard is also located between the two rivers Bregenzer Ach and Rhine, and borders on the provincial capital Bregenz.

== History ==
In the 7th century, Alemanni settled near Mittelweiherburg. Near Lake Constance, around the year 1200, large parts of the woods were cleared to build a village: Hard (Old High German for &quot;forest&quot;). The community of Hard was first mentioned in a charter from Pope Innocent IV to the monastery of Mehrerau in 1249.

In 1794, Samuel Vogel from Alsace opened the first Hard textile factory. In 1802, the &quot;Allmenden&quot; (common grounds) were suspended, resulting in private fields, pastures and forests. In 1997, the textile printing museum in Mittelweiherburg was opened.

=== Harder Schwabenkinder (Swabian children) ===

From the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century, many poor Vorarlberg farmers sent their children to Swabia, Southern Germany, to do seasonal work there. These children were called &quot;Schwabenkinder&quot;, the undertaking itself was referred to as &quot;Schwabengehen&quot;.

=== Heraldry ===
The coat of arms of Hard shows two trees and a sailboat. They symbolize important early activities in Hard: logging and fishing.

==Transport==
Hard-Fussach railway station serves Hard and Fußach. It is located on the St. Margrethen–Lauterach line. The station is served by the S3 and R5 regional train services of Vorarlberg S-Bahn, operated by Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB).

<text>In the field of analysis of algorithms in computer science, the accounting method is a method of amortized analysis based on accounting. The accounting method often gives a more intuitive account of the amortized cost of an operation than either aggregate analysis or the potential method. Note, however, that this does not guarantee such analysis will be immediately obvious; often, choosing the correct parameters for the accounting method requires as much knowledge of the problem and the complexity bounds one is attempting to prove as the other two methods.

The accounting method is most naturally suited for proving an O(1) bound on time. The method as explained here is for proving such a bound.

==The method==

A set of elementary operations which will be used in the algorithm is chosen and their costs are arbitrarily set to 1. The fact that the costs of these operations may differ in reality presents no difficulty in principle. What is important is that each elementary operation has a constant cost.

Each aggregate operation is assigned a &quot;payment&quot;. The payment is intended to cover the cost of elementary operations needed to complete this particular operation, with some of the payment left over, placed in a pool to be used later.

The difficulty with problems that require amortized analysis is that, in general, some of the operations will require greater than constant cost. This means that no constant payment will be enough to cover the worst case cost of an operation, in and of itself. With proper selection of payment, however, this is no longer a difficulty; the expensive operations will only occur when there is sufficient payment in the pool to cover their costs.

==Examples==

A few examples will help to illustrate the use of the accounting method.

===Table expansion===

It is often necessary to create a table before it is known how much space is needed. One possible strategy is to double the size of the table when it is full. Here we will use the accounting method to show that the amortized cost of an insertion operation in such a table is O(1).

Before looking at the procedure in detail, we need some definitions. Let be a table, an element to insert, num(T) the number of elements in , and size(T) the allocated size of . We assume the existence of operations create_table(n), which creates an empty table of size , for now assumed to be free, and elementary_insert(T,E), which inserts element into a table that already has space allocated, with a cost of 1.

The following pseudocode illustrates the table insertion procedure:
 function table_insert(T, E)
 if num(T) = size(T)
 U := create_table(2 × size(T))
 for each F in T
 elementary_insert(U, F)
 T := U
 elementary_insert(T, E)

Without amortized analysis, the best bound we can show for n insert operations is O(n) — this is due to the loop at line 4 that performs num(T) elementary insertions.

For analysis using the accounting method, we assign a payment of 3 to each table insertion. Although the reason for this is not clear now, it will become clear during the course of the analysis.

Assume that initially the table is empty with size(T) = m. The first m insertions therefore do not require reallocation and only have cost 1 (for the elementary insert). Therefore, when num(T) = m, the pool has (3 - 1)×m = 2m.

Inserting element m + 1 requires reallocation of the table. Creating the new table on line 3 is free (for now). The loop on line 4 requires m elementary insertions, for a cost of m. Including the insertion on the last line, the total cost for this operation is m + 1. After this operation, the pool therefore has 2m + 3 - (m + 1) = m + 2.

Next, we add another m - 1 elements to the table. At this point the pool has m + 2 + 2×(m - 1) = 3m. Inserting an additional element (that is, element 2m + 1) can be seen to have cost 2m + 1 and a payment of 3. After this operation, the pool has 3m + 3 - (2m + 1) = m + 2. Note that this is the same amount as after inserting element m + 1. In fact, we can show that this will be the case for any number of reallocations.

It can now be made clear why the payment for an insertion is 3. 1 pays for the first insertion of the element, 1 pays for moving the element the next time the table is expanded, and 1 pays for moving an older element the next time the table is expanded. Intuitively, this explains why an element&#x27;s contribution never &quot;runs out&quot; regardless of how many times the table is expanded: since the table is always doubled, the newest half always covers the cost of moving the oldest half.

We initially assumed that creating a table was free. In reality, creating a table of size n may be as expensive as O(n). Let us say that the cost of creating a table of size n is n. Does this new cost present a difficulty? Not really; it turns out we use the same method to show the amortized O(1) bounds. All we have to do is change the payment.

When a new table is created, there is an old table with m entries. The new table will be of size 2m. As long as the entries currently in the table have added enough to the pool to pay for creating the new table, we will be all right.

We cannot expect the first formula_1 entries to help pay for the new table. Those entries already paid for the current table. We must then rely on the last formula_1 entries to pay the cost formula_3. This means we must add formula_4 to the payment for each entry, for a total payment of 3 + 4 = 7.

<text>Unit 516 (第五一六部隊) was a top secret Japanese chemical weapons facility, operated by the Kempeitai, in Qiqihar, Japanese-occupied northeast China. The name Unit 516 was a code name (Tsūshōgō) of the Unit. It was officially called the Kwantung Army Chemical Weapons Section and operated underneath Unit 731.

An estimated 700,000 (Japanese estimation) to 2,000,000 (Chinese estimation) Japanese-produced chemical weapons were buried in China. Until 1995, Japan had refused to acknowledge that it dumped chemical weapons in the Nen River between Heilongjiang and Hulunbei&#x27;er, leaving huge amounts behind.

==Chemical weapons==
* Phosgene
* Hydrogen cyanide
* Bromobenzyl cyanide and Chloroacetophenone
* Diphenylcyanoarsine and Diphenylchloroarsine
* Arsenic trichloride
* Sulfur Mustard
* Lewisite

At the end of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army buried some of their chemical weapons in China, but most were confiscated by Soviet Red Army, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and the Kuomintang Army, along with other weapons. The Soviet Union later handed over these weapons to China (ROC), who then buried them. Japanese chemical weapons were later found mixed with Soviet and Chinese chemical weapons.

The Japanese National Institute for Defense Studies has a record of Japanese weapons confiscated by Kuomintang Army along with a list of the types of chemical weapons. No confiscation records about ROC / Russia have been found. However, no country has records about the locations of the buried chemical weapons. China has started gathering these abandoned weapons for destruction and burial, and they are currently buried in remote Dunhua County, in Haerbaling, Jilin (吉林) province.

==The Chemical Weapons Convention==
One of the focuses of the Chemical Weapons Convention was to assign responsibility for the destruction of old chemical weapons in China. The convention was signed in 1993 and according to it, all chemical weapons created after 1925 must be destroyed by the originating-country. Under the convention, Japan is building a factory in China to destroy chemical weapons.

<doc id="1124022" wikidata="Q941179" url="?curid=1124022" title="Articulated locomotive">
<text>An [[articulated vehicle|articulated]] locomotive is a steam locomotive (rarely, an electric locomotive) with one or more engine units that can move independently of the main frame. Articulation allows the operation of locomotives that would otherwise be too large to negotiate a railroad&#x27;s curves, whether mainlines or special lines with extreme curvature such as logging, industrial, or mountain railways.

Articulated locomotives saw service in many nations, but were very popular on narrow-gauge railways in Europe. The largest examples were developed in the United States, where the Union Pacific Big Boy 4-8-8-4s and the Allegheny H-8 2-6-6-6s were some of the largest steam locomotives ever built, with Big Boy 4014 remaining as the largest, and last of its kind, to still operate.

Many schemes for articulation were developed over the years. Of these, the Mallet locomotive and its simple-expansion derivative were the most popular, followed by the Garratt type (mostly built in the United Kingdom, popular throughout Europe, Africa and European colonies), and the various geared steam locomotive types, the latter largely used in logging, mining and industry. Most other types saw only limited success.

As distinct from articulated locomotives, a non-articulated locomotive is referred to as a &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;rigid&quot; locomotive.

==Articulated steam locomotive types==
===Major types===
The major types of articulated locomotive are:
* The Fairlie, with two powered trucks under a double boiler, or its Single Fairlie single-boiler derivative with one powered and one unpowered truck (known as a Mason Bogie in the United States).
* The Garratt locomotive, with an engine unit at each end carrying coal and water supplies, and a boiler unit articulated between them.
* The Mallet locomotive, with one fixed engine under the rear of the locomotive and a radially swinging engine unit in front.
* The Meyer locomotive, with two powered engine trucks under the locomotive (generally with the cylinders inward). Also, the Kitson-Meyer variant with the trucks spread apart to allow a deeper firebox between them.

===Simple expansion===
Simple expansion, or simple, articulated steam engines had two sets of equally sized cylinders. High-pressure steam was supplied to all cylinders and exhausted out of the stack once it had been used. The American simple-expansion articulated, thanks largely to the smaller mass of the forward cylinders when compared to the compound-expansion Mallets allowing for higher piston speed, were generally better suited for high speed than their compound cousins. Examples of the &quot;simple mallet&quot; design include the Union Pacific Big Boys and Challengers, the Chesapeake and Ohio class H-8, the 2-8-8-4 &quot;Yellowstones&quot;, the majority of Southern Pacific&#x27;s Cab-forwards, and the Norfolk &amp; Western A-class.

===Compound expansion===
Compound expansion, or compound, articulated steam engines like Anatole Mallet&#x27;s original idea, consist of two sets of unequally sized cylinders. The smaller pair of cylinders near the cab was fed with high pressure steam directly from the boiler and then the steam was passed into a pair of low-pressure cylinders at the front, with larger diameter to offset the lower pressure, before exhausting through the smokestack. While the thermal efficiency was greatly improved through the compound use of steam in Mallet designs, the large low-pressure cylinders posed unique limitations, both in terms of loading gauge (the cylinders could only be as large as the track and track-side infrastructure allowed) and in terms of performance at speed. The large and consequently heavier pistons caused stability issues at higher speed, which generally limited compound expansion articulated locomotives to below 30 or 40 miles per hour. A notable exception to this was to be found in later iterations of Norfolk &amp; Western Y-class 2-8-8-2s, which could and did often exceed 50 miles per hour in service as well as being one of the hardest-pulling steam locomotives ever built.

The first Garratt locomotives constructed, the Tasmanian Government Railways K class were also compound locomotives, but were complicated as a result. All subsequent Garratts were simple engines only.

===Geared types===
There were various types of articulated geared steam locomotive, including:
* Climax locomotive
* Heisler locomotive
* Shay locomotive
* Willamette locomotive

===Other types===
* du Bousquet locomotive
* Engerth locomotive
* Gölsdorf axle
* Golwé locomotive
* Hagans locomotive, such as the Prussian T 13 (Hagans variant)
* Klien-Lindner locomotive
* Krauss-Helmholtz bogie
* Luttermöller axle

==Electric locomotives==
There are several classes of articulated electric locomotives of generally two types:
* Three sections, where the middle part sits on the two outer parts (similar to the Garratt design), e.g.
** Milwaukee Road class EP-2
** Swiss crocodile locomotives, :de:SBB Ce 6/8 II and :de:SBB Ce 6/8 III
** DRG Class E 94, :de:DRB-Baureihe E 94
* Two sections which share a central or Jacobs bogie, e.g.
** FS Class E.636 in Italy, first built in 1940
** HŽ series 1061, a derivative of E.636 operating in Croatia - also known as SŽ series 362 in Slovenia and as JŽ series 362 in Yugoslavia
** FS Class E.646 in Italy, first built in 1958
** FS Class E.656 operating in Italy since 1975
** Rhaetian Railway Ge 6/6 II in Switzerland
** New Zealand EW class, built by English Electric in 1952.

The conventional electric and diesel locomotive dual bogie design uses the same general configuration as the Meyer design but is not considered to be articulated.

<text>Lochau is a municipality in the westernmost Austrian state of Vorarlberg. It is located on Lake Constance, in the Bregenz district, near the border to Germany.

About 50.3% of the municipality&#x27;s area is forest. The Pfänder, the landmark mountain of the neighboring municipality of Bregenz, also lies within Lochau&#x27;s boundaries. In the west, the Leiblach river forms the border to the German county (Landkreis) of Lindau.

==History==
The Habsburgs ruled over their Vorarlberg lands alternately from Tyrol and Further Austria. From 1805 to 1814 Lochau belonged to Bavaria, then reverted to Austria. In 1861 it became part of the Austrian Federal State of Vorarlberg. During World War II, a subcamp of Dachau concentration camp was located there. Between 1945 and 1955 the municipality was part of the French occupation zone in Austria.

==Population==

==Transport==
Lochau-Hörbranz railway station serves Lochau and Hörbranz. It is located on Vorarlberg&#x27;s main line, which runs in north-south direction. The station is served by the S1 regional train service of Vorarlberg S-Bahn and a regional express train (REX 1), both operated by Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB).

<doc id="1124025" wikidata="Q3658629" url="?curid=1124025" title="Limit load (physics)">
<text>Limit load is the maximum load that a structure can safely carry. It&#x27;s the load at which the structure is in a state of incipient plastic collapse. As the load on the structure increases, the displacements increases linearly in the elastic range until the load attains the yield value. Beyond this, the load-displacement response becomes non-linear and the plastic or irreversible part of the displacement increases steadily with the applied load. Plasticity spreads throughout the solid and at the limit load, the plastic zone becomes very large and the displacements become unbounded and the component is said to have collapsed.

Any load above the limit load will lead to the formation of plastic hinge in the structure. Engineers use limit states to define and check a structure&#x27;s performance.

Bounding Theorems of Plastic-Limit Load Analysis:
Plastic limit theorems provide a way to calculate limit loads without having to solve the boundary value problem in continuum mechanics. Finite element analysis provides an alternative way to estimate limit loads. They are:
* The Upper Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem
* The Lower Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem
* The Lower Bound Shakedown Theorem
* The Upper Bound Shakedown Theorem

The Upper Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem states that an upper bound to the collapse loads can be obtained by postulating a collapse mechanism and computing the ratio of its plastic dissipation to the work done by the applied loads.

<text>IBM LAN Server is a discontinued network operating system introduced by International Business Machines (IBM) in 1988. LAN Server started as a close cousin of Microsoft&#x27;s LAN Manager and first shipped in early 1988. It was originally designed to run on top of Operating System/2 (OS/2) Extended Edition. The network client was called IBM LAN Requester and was included with OS/2 EE 1.1 by default. (Eventually IBM shipped other clients and supported yet more. Examples include the &quot;IBM OS/2 File/Print Client&quot;, &quot;IBM OS/2 Peer&quot;, and client software for Microsoft Windows.) Here the short term &quot;LAN Server&quot; refers to the IBM OS/2 LAN Server product. There were also LAN Server products for other operating systems, notably AIX—now called Fast Connect—and OS/400.

==Version history==

Predecessors included IBM PC LAN Program (PCLP). Variants included LAN Server Ultimedia (optimized for network delivery of multimedia files) and LAN On-Demand. Add-ons included Directory and Security Server, Print Services Facility/2 (later known as Advanced Printing), Novell NetWare for OS/2, and LAN Server for Macintosh.

==Innovations==
LAN Server pioneered certain file and print sharing concepts such as domains (and domain controllers), networked COM ports, domain aliases, and automatic printer driver selection and installation.

<doc id="1124041" wikidata="Q5629" url="?curid=1124041" title="Šešupė">
<text>The Šešupė (); ; ; ) is a 298 km long river that flows through Poland (27 km), Lithuania (158 km), and Russia (62 km). The river flows for 51 km along the border between the Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave of Russia, and Lithuania. The Šešupė originates near the Polish town of Szeszupka, about 16 km from the Polish-Lithuanian border, and flows into the Nemunas near the town of Neman on the border between Lithuania and Kaliningrad Oblast.

Major towns and cities along the river, from the Nemunas to the source, are: Kudirkos Naumiestis, Pilviškiai, Marijampolė and Kalvarija.

There are parts of Kaliningrad and Lithuania that are on the opposite side of the river, including a small island that is mostly Russian but has an area belonging to Lithuania.

The Šešupė is the fourth-longest river in Lithuania. Its main tributaries are: (left) Rausvė, Širvinta, and (right) Szelmentka, Dovinė, Pilvė, Višakis, Nova and Siesartis.
Etymology of the name Šešupė is not exactly clear. &quot;Upė&quot; means river in Lithuanian. The root &quot;šeš-&quot; most probably originates from the word &quot;sausa&quot; meaning &quot;dry&quot;, i.e. the dry river (&quot;sausupė&quot;). There is also the association with the word &quot;šeši&quot; which means number six in Lithuania, and the river name could be understood &quot;river of six&quot; or just &quot;sixriver&quot;, but the most likely etymological explanation is that part of the name &quot;šeš&quot; derived from the term &quot;šėšėlis&quot; meaning shadow, and the river name itself could be translated as a &quot;shadow river&quot;.

<doc id="1124042" wikidata="Q922732" url="?curid=1124042" title="Cross of Valour (Australia)">
<text>The Cross of Valour was established in 1975 as the highest Australian Bravery Award. The awards were established as part of the institution of the Australian Honours System. The Cross of Valour has been awarded to five Australian civilians and, although there has been no Australian military recipient, they would be eligible in situations where normal honours to the military do not apply.

The Cross of Valour is awarded &quot;only for acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril&quot;. The award carries the post-nominal initials CV; awards may be made posthumously.

==Description==
* The Cross of Valour is a gold, straight-armed cross pattée with diminishing rays between the arms. It is ensigned with the Crown of St Edward.
* The obverse has the shield and crest of the Commonwealth Coat of Arms surmounted by a Federation Star. A suspender bar is engraved with the words &#x27;For Valour&#x27;.
* The ribbon is 38 mm wide, magenta with a central 16 mm blood-red band. The two reds in the ribbon represent the colours of venous and arterial blood.

==List of recipients==
To date, the Cross of Valour has been awarded to five recipients.

;1989
* Mr Darrell Tree, Captain of Mount Damper Fire Brigade, SA – Rescued a 3-year-old child from electrocution.

;1995
* Mr Victor Boscoe, Qld – Pursued and apprehended armed robbers at Strathpine.

;1998
* Senior Constable Allan Sparkes, NSW – Rescued a boy from flooded underground storm water drains.

;2003
* Senior Constable Timothy Britten, WA – Entered the Sari Club, destroyed in the 2002 Bali bombings, to rescue a badly injured woman, and then searched for other potential survivors despite personal injury and ongoing explosions.
* Mr Richard Joyes, WA – Entered the bombed Sari Club alongside Senior Constable Timothy Britten to rescue a badly injured woman and search for other potential survivors despite personal injury and ongoing explosions. He represented recipients at the 2023 Coronation.

==Decoration allowance==
The Australian Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs may grant an allowance, called decoration allowance, to a veteran who has been awarded the Cross of Valour if the veteran is in receipt of a pension under Part II of the Veterans&#x27; Entitlements Act 1986 (VE Act) and the award was for gallantry during a war to which the VE Act applies or during warlike operations. So far there have been no awards of the Cross of Valour during wars or warlike operations as required by the VE Act. The allowance has been A$2.10 per fortnight since the Goods and Services Tax in Australia commenced on 1 July 2000.

In 1876, Ichizaemon Morimura VI and his brother Toyo founded Morimura Gumi with the intent of establishing overseas trading by a Japanese company. By 1878, Toyo had established a business in New York selling Japanese antiques and other goods, including pottery. The company was renamed Morimura Brothers in 1881. By the 1890s, the company had shifted from retail to wholesale operations and started working on design improvements for the pottery and porcelain ware, which had become one third of its business. By 1899, all of the pottery and porcelain decorating factories in Tokyo and Kyoto had been consolidated in Nagoya, and the company started research on creating European style hard white porcelain in Japan.

In 1904, key members of this trading company created the Nippon Toki Kaisha, Ltd. (&quot;the Company that makes Japan&#x27;s Finest China&quot;) in Japan. A new factory was built in Noritake, near Nagoya (now Noritake-shinmachi, Nishi-ku, Nagoya, Aichi). In 1914 the company succeeded in creating their first Western style dinner set, called &quot;Sedan&quot;, to compete with European porcelain companies. Nippon Toki wares were mostly aimed at the European Market. This forerunner of the modern Noritake Company was founded in the village of Noritake, a small suburb near Nagoya, Japan. Most of the company’s early wares carried one of the various “Nippon” back stamps to indicate its country of origin when exported to Western markets. Today, many collectors agree that the best examples of “Nippon-era” (1891–1921) hand painted porcelain carry a back stamp used by &quot;Noritake&quot; during the Nippon era.
By 1923, Nippon Toki was looking to streamline its paperwork using machines to handle large orders coming in from the United States, and was impressed by the Hollereth tabulating machines manufactured by the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). In May 1925, Morimura-Brothers entered into a sole agency agreement with CTR (which had been renamed IBM in 1924) to import the Hollerith machines into Japan. The first Hollerith tabulator in Japan was installed at Nippon Pottery in September 1925, making Noritake IBM&#x27;s first customer in Japan.

In 1939, Noritake started selling industrial grinding wheels based on its porcelain finishing technology. It now provides ceramic and diamond grinding and abrasive solutions for many industries. Other products currently manufactured by Noritake, also derived from its core tableware manufacturing technologies, include thick film circuit substrates, engineering ceramics, ceramic powder, and vacuum fluorescent displays, as well as heating furnaces and kilns, mixing technology, filtration systems, and cutting and grinding machines.

Although consumers and collectors alike have called the tableware, &quot;Noritake&quot; (and/or simply, &quot;Nippon&quot;) since the late 1920s, the Japanese parent company did not officially change its name to the Noritake Co., Limited until 1981. Evidently, since Noritake is the name of a place, the company was initially prohibited from registering the name as a trade name.

The Noritake Garden in Nagoya features the production of its ceramics.

==Overseas==

Australia

Noritake Australia Pty Ltd was established in 1958 and it is owned by Noritake Co., Limited. By the late 1960s Noritake brand had become a household name. Noritake is an official supplier to Qantas Airways for in-flight and ground-based operations. The brand has worked together with the airline and Australian designers such as Marc Newson and David Caon to create a crockery range for Qantas International First and Business. A subsequent collaboration with Australian chef Adam Liaw resulted in a crockery line called &quot;Everyday by Adam Liaw&quot;.

Noritake Australia also distributes industrial grinding wheels in the Australian market.

Sri Lanka

In 1973 Noritake constructed a factory in Sri Lanka. In 2016 this factory employed 1,200 people and exported 6 million pieces of porcelain annually.

<text>21-87 is a 1963 Canadian abstract montage-collage film created by Arthur Lipsett that lasts 9 minutes and 33 seconds. The short, produced by the National Film Board of Canada, is a collage of snippets from discarded footage found by Lipsett in the editing room of the National Film Board (where he was employed as an animator), combined with his own black and white 16 mm footage which he shot on the streets of Montreal and New York City, among other locations.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;21-87&quot; premiered on the CBC program &quot;Explorations&quot; in 1964.

Journalist Howard Junker dismisses &quot;21-87&quot; and Lipsett&#x27;s other film, &quot;Free Fall&quot;, as repetitious: &quot;the whole idea of wildly flashing stills and phrases wears quickly&quot;. Critic N. Roy Clifton is frustrated by the seeming randomness of the images. Critic John Fell suggests the film is evocative of parataxis, like a sentence without a conjunctive word.

==Influence on George Lucas==
&quot;21-87&quot; would have a profound influence on director George Lucas and on Walter Murch, an editor and designer with whom Lucas worked. Lucas described it as &quot;the kind of movie I wanted to make – a very off the wall, abstract kind of film&quot;.

In response, Lucas created the pure cinema, short, 16mm movies: &quot;6-18-67&quot;, &quot;1:42.08&quot;, and &quot;Look at Life&quot;. The later &quot;Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB&quot;, an experimental science fiction short, takes place in a dystopian future on 14 May 2187. Lucas expanded the latter into &quot;THX 1138&quot;. His later works &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; have shown &quot;21-87&quot;&#x27;s influence. Lucas and Lipsett would never meet.

The concept of the Force, so prominent in &quot;Star Wars&quot; and its sequels and prequels, is said to have been inspired by a statement made by Roman Kroitor in the short film.

===References in Lucas&#x27;s works and Star Wars===

*In &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Princess Leia&#x27;s prison cell on the Death Star is numbered 2187.
*In &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, the order to initiate the Great Jedi Purge (Order 66) can be found by subtracting 21 from 87.
*In the post Lucas era &quot;Star Wars sequel trilogy&quot;, FN-2187 is the designation of one of the main characters, who is later renamed Finn.

<text>Taxi 2 () is a 2000 French action comedy film directed by Gérard Krawczyk and released in March 2000. Starring Samy Naceri, Frédéric Diefenthal and Marion Cotillard. It is the second installment in the &quot;Taxi&quot; film series. It is a sequel to &quot;Taxi&quot;, written by Luc Besson and directed by Gérard Pirès in 1999. It was followed by &quot;Taxi 3&quot; in January 2003.

A video game adaptation was released by Ubisoft, also in 2000.

==Plot==
A Japanese minister of defence is traveling to Paris to sign a weapons contract between Japan and France, but first, he is visiting Marseille to view and rate the city police&#x27;s anti gang tactics (using fake attacks on him).

During the visit, however, he is kidnapped by a group working for the Japanese yakuza. Emilien (Frédéric Diefenthal) is determined to rescue the minister and detective Petra (Emma Sjöberg), his girlfriend who was also kidnapped, and restore the honour of his department. Once again, speed demon taxi driver Daniel (Samy Naceri) is called upon to save the day with his high speed driving skills.

Also with the Peugeot, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI is also featured as a star car driven by the yakuza.

== Cast ==

* Samy Naceri as Daniel Morales
* Frédéric Diefenthal as Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec
* Marion Cotillard as Lilly Bertineau
* Emma Sjöberg as Petra
* Bernard Farcy as Commissaire Gérard Gibert

==Production==
===Development===

Production started immediately after the massive success of the first film in the theaters, but this time Besson wanted to up his share of the split with the production company ARP to 70/30 from 50/50. Lead of ARP and Besson&#x27;s friend Pétin grit his teeth, as he had carried the first project, but he agreed. The director of the first film Gérard Pirès was replaced by Gérard Krawczyk, who detractors say was more controllable, but who responded back stating he did what he wanted without needing to respect the scenarios laid by Besson.

===Cameraman death===
On Monday, August 16, 1999, only two weeks into filming, Boulevard de l&#x27;Amiral-Bruix was closed to traffic for the length between Porte Dauphine and Porte Maillot. The Peugeot 406 had to come speeding out of the tunnel, head on to the springboard, jump over two AMX-30 tanks and land on a bed of boxes and mattresses. After an unsuccessful first try, the stunt coordinator Rémy Julienne with 35 years of experience and credit of 4000 films including six James Bond films, decided to increase the incline of the springboard a bit and also up the car&#x27;s running speed. On the second take, the taxi took off faster and higher, landing a few meters further than expected, hitting the 41-year-old cameraman Alain Dutartre, his assistant and a third person. Dutartre died a few hours later in the hospital. The assistant had both of his legs broken. Besson was in Los Angeles at the time and was contacted immediately. He flew to the set, where detectives were already investigating the matter. Filming had to continue, but did so in a somber mood.

In June 2002, Luc Besson was summoned to court. Authorities alleged safety was compromised in an effort to cut costs. The stunt coordinator Rémy Julienne was given a one-year suspended jail sentence, and fined €13,000. Luc Besson, Grenet and director Gerard Krawczyk were initially cleared of charges. But the Paris Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in June 2009, and EuropaCorp was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and ordered to pay €100,000. Julienne&#x27;s jail sentence was reduced to six months, and his fine was reduced from €13,000 to €2,000, but he was required to pay the Dutartre family €50,000 in court costs.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Opening on 830 screens on 29 March 2000, the film set an opening day and week record in France. It had 759,512 admissions on opening day, beating the record set by &quot;Asterix and Obelix vs. Caesar,&quot; and over 3 million admissions for the week, beating the record set by &quot; The Visitors II: The Corridors of Time&quot;. It went on to have 10.3 million admissions in France (the highest for the year) and 5 million in 37 other countries worldwide. It also had good TV ratings with 10 million viewers on TF1.

===Critical response===
Neil Smith, reviewing the film for BBC, gave it two stars out of five and writes that it&#x27;s a &quot;virtual reprise of the 1998 French box-office smash&quot; and while &quot;there&#x27;s very little of merit in this tongue-in-cheek actioner, it at least delivers the requisite amount of high-octane thrills.&quot;

==Video games==
A video game based on the movie was published by Ubisoft and released in France only in 2000 for the PC, Dreamcast (both versions developed by Blue Sphere Games), PlayStation (developed by DC Studios) and Game Boy Color (developed by Visual Impact).

<text>It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day is an American band formed in San Francisco, California, in 1967, featuring vocalist Pattie Santos along with violinist David LaFlamme and his wife, Linda LaFlamme, on keyboards.

David LaFlamme, who as a youth had once performed as a soloist with the Utah Symphony Orchestra, had previously been in the group Orkustra playing five-string violin. The other members of It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day in its early years were Val Fuentes (drums), Mitchell Holman (bass) and Hal Wagenet (guitar). Although they were one of the notable San Francisco bands to emerge from 1967&#x27;s Summer of Love, the band never achieved the success of contemporaries such as the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Santana, with whom they had connections. The band created a unique blend of rock, jazz, folk, classical, and world-beat styles.

==Early history: 1967–1969==
The band&#x27;s original manager, Matthew Katz, had previously worked with the rock bands Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape. The members of the band were unaware that the other two bands were already trying to end their business relationships with Katz. During 1967 and early 1968, Katz prevented It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day from performing in San Francisco, telling them they were not ready. He booked their first public appearances at a club he controlled in Seattle, Washington, formerly known as the Encore Ballroom. Katz renamed the club San Francisco Sound. While in Seattle, the group lived in the attic of an old house owned by Katz while writing and rehearsing new songs in between club performances. Few customers came to the club during the band&#x27;s engagement in Seattle during December 1967.

The band&#x27;s signature song &quot;White Bird&quot; was inspired by the experiences David and Linda LaFlamme had while living in Seattle. The song was partly inspired by Seattle&#x27;s rainy winter weather. In a later interview, David LaFlamme said:

Where the &#x27;white bird&#x27; thing came from ... We were like caged birds in that attic. We had no money, no transportation, the weather was miserable. We were just barely getting by on a very small food allowance provided to us. It was quite an experience, but it was very creative in a way.

By the time the group members returned to San Francisco they had no money and were frustrated by Katz&#x27;s attempts to manipulate their career. In desperation, they began playing at a few clubs without his approval. The band gradually gained some recognition and earned some money. Some of that recognition came from their performance at the Sky River Rock Festival and Lighter Than Air Fair, occurring over the 1968 Labor Day weekend in Sultan, Washington. Sky River is considered by many to be the first successful multi-day rock festival, and a number of major bands had the opportunity to hear It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day there. The band got its first big break when offered a chance to open for Cream at the Oakland Coliseum, in Oakland, California on October 4, 1968. Around this time, the band first began a long process of trying to disentangle themselves from Katz.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&quot;, was produced by David LaFlamme in Los Angeles, California, and released by Columbia Records in 1969. It features tracks such as &quot;White Bird&quot;, &quot;Hot Summer Day&quot;, and &quot;Time Is&quot;. The album reached number 47 in the U.S. charts and number 58 in the UK. The theme from the song &quot;Bombay Calling&quot; was later used, at a slower tempo, by Deep Purple as the intro to &quot;Child in Time&quot; on its &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot; album. The band retaliated by recording &quot;Don &amp; Dewey&quot; which was, to all intents and purposes, identical to Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Wring That Neck&quot;. The vocals and violin playing of David LaFlamme plus Santos&#x27; singing attracted FM-radio-play attention, and nationally, &quot;White Bird&quot; bubbled under &quot;Billboard&quot; &#x27;s Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 118.

==1970s and beyond==
By 1970, the original lineup of the band had changed; the LaFlammes had split up and Linda left the band and was replaced by Fred Webb. On July 5, 1970, the band played the second Atlanta International Pop Festival in Byron, Georgia to an estimated 250,000 people. The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Marrying Maiden&quot;, recorded at Pacific High Recording Studios in San Francisco, was released in 1970. It was their most successful on the charts, reaching number 28 in the U.S. and number 45 in the U.K. In that same year, the band performed at the Holland Pop Festival at the Kralingse Bos in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music.

It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day was one of the last acts to appear at the Fillmore West in San Francisco in July 1971. Its performance of &quot;White Bird&quot; was featured as part of the musical documentary film &quot;Fillmore&quot;, released the following year.
Mitchell Holman and Hal Wagenet left in the summer of 1971 and were replaced by bassist Tom Fowler (later with Frank Zappa) and guitarist Bill Gregory. Their first performance was broadcast live on San Francisco&#x27;s KSAN FM radio, with host Tom Donahue introducing them as the band&#x27;s two new members.

The group released their third album, &quot;Choice Quality Stuff/Anytime&quot;, in 1971, followed by the live album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day at Carnegie Hall&quot;, in 1972. Tom Fowler left that same year. Citing exhaustion, and with differences arising over the direction and management of the band among band members, David LaFlamme resigned later in 1972. &quot;It&#x27;s A Beautiful Day...Today&quot; was recorded and released the following year, and the band toured until the summer of 1973 when it split up. Replacement bassist and vocalist James &quot;Bud&quot; Cockrell would help form Pablo Cruise shortly thereafter, and violinist Gregory Bloch joined the Italian progressive rock group Premiata Forneria Marconi and later the Saturday Night Live Band.

In 1976, LaFlamme&#x27;s solo version of &quot;White Bird&quot; finally cracked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 89. Pattie Santos, who had formed Cockrell &amp; Santos with her husband, former bassist Bud Cockrell, in 1977, was killed in a car crash near Geyserville in Sonoma County, California on December 14, 1989. Cockrell himself died in 2010.

It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day reformed occasionally for reunions and special concerts. The band&#x27;s music continued under the name David LaFlamme Band as well as It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day until Katz let his trademark of the name go unrenewed, and the use of It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day was formally resumed.

From 2000, It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day featured founder David LaFlamme and original drummer Fuentes. Other band members are LaFlamme&#x27;s current wife, whom he met in 1974, Linda Baker LaFlamme (vocals), Toby Gray (bass), Gary Thomas (keyboards), Rob Espinosa (guitar), and Michael Prichard (percussion). This line-up was the longest continual group that has ever performed the band&#x27;s material. In 2014, Rob Cunningham replaced Espinosa on lead guitar. Rob Espinosa returned as lead guitar in 2018.

In 2009 David LaFlamme began playing with the Phil Lawrence Band and transformed the group into It&#x27;s A Beautiful Day Acoustic. The band played acoustic versions of the best-known originals from the early albums, plus instrumental originals by Phil Lawrence on the mandolin. They performed until the pandemic shutdown in March 2020.

In later years, David LaFlamme suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died in Santa Rosa, California on August 6, 2023, at the age of 82.

Linda LaFlamme died from vascular dementia on October 23, 2024, at the age of 85.

<text>The Speyside Way (Doric: &quot;&quot;; ) is a long-distance path in the Scottish Highlands. The route begins in Buckie and ends at Newtonmore, away. There is an optional spur leading off the main route to Tomintoul, adding and of ascent.

The route primarily follows the River Spey through the scenery of Banffshire, Morayshire and Inverness-shire in Scotland, passing some of the distilleries that produce Speyside single malts. The first section from Buckie to Spey Bay follows the coastline, while the final section from Aviemore to Newtonmore follows most of the route of the former Strathspey Railway. It is listed as one of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails by NatureScot, and links directly to two further Great Trails: the Dava Way and the Moray Coast Trail. About 52,750 people use the path every year, of whom about 2,750 complete the entire route. As with the other Great Trails, the Way is waymarked with a symbol showing a thistle in a hexagon.

The Way was opened in 1981, from Spey Bay to Ballindalloch, and was extended over the years to reach Aviemore by 2000. In 2020 the final extension to Newtonmore was completed. In 2021 the route&#x27;s official website was modernised and its former bootprint logo replaced by a green-blue circle enclosing a stylised distillery and salmon. 

Since 1994, the Speyside Way Ultramarathon has been run from Cragganmore distillery in Ballindalloch to Buckie, a distance of .

<text>The Proastiakos (; &quot;suburban&quot;) is Greece&#x27;s Commuter rail service, run by Hellenic Train, on rail infrastructure owned by the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE) (lines) and GAIAOSE (buildings and Trains). These services connect a participating city&#x27;s central railway station to important locations such as a city&#x27;s port or airport, as well as its suburbs and occasionally nearby towns and cities.

As of September 2020, there are three Proastiakos networks serving the country&#x27;s three largest cities: Athens, Thessaloniki, and Patras, providing them with commuter rail links towards their suburbs and also with regional services to other cities and towns. In 2016, the three systems carried 10.1 million passengers.

As of 8 January 2017, the lines between the central stations of Athens and Halkida have been electrified, allowing EMU train service. The lines have been changed, making Athens&#x27;s central station the main layover station. Those lines are Athens – ATH, Athens – Kiato, Athens – Chalcis.

In Thessaloniki, there are two Proastiakos services. The first connects the city&#x27;s Main Railway Station with the cities of Katerini and Larissa, and the second links the city with Edessa.

In July 2010, a new commuter rail service was launched in Patras on a section of the old Patras–Kyparissia line reconnecting the city with Rio. The service was later extended to Agios Andreas as Line P2. In 2020 services were reconnected to Kato Achaia via Agios Andreas as Line P1.

==History==

The concept of regular and frequent suburban and commuter rail services was introduced in Greece in the 1990s. It became possible due to extra capacity becoming available through improvements to the existing lines and the construction of new ones. In the past, suburban services ran on very infrequent timetables and were not very popular.

The construction of a new rail line between central Athens, its eastern suburbs, and the new Athens International Airport was decided in 1992–1993. During the construction of Attiki Odos motorway in the late 1990s, space was left between the main carriageways for the railway line. After two years of construction, the line to Athens International Airport opened in 2004. The first suburban services between Athens and the Airport were inaugurated using Stadler GTW and Siemens Desiro DMU trains.

On 27 September 2005, the new standard gauge rail line reached Corinth, terminating at a new station, located at Examilia. This line today is served by &quot;Proastiakos&quot; suburban services, while initially &quot;Proastiakos&quot; trains stopped at Nea Peramos, Megara, Kinetta, and Agioi Theodoroi. On 18 July 2006, three new stations were added: Ano Liosia, Aspropyrgos, and Magoula. On 4 June 2007, the line was extended from Athens Central Station to the port of Piraeus with 3 intermediate stations at Lefka, Rentis, and Rouf. This extension linked the airport with the port of Piraeus. On 9 July 2007, Proastiakos services reached the new station at Kiato.

Hellenic Train also runs &quot;Proastiakos&quot; commuter rail services between the cities of Thessaloniki and Larissa, on the modernised and electrified main line. The service initially operated from Thessaloniki to Litochoro in 2007 and was extended to Larissa in 2008.

In 2009 the brand name &quot;Proastiakos&quot; was also used for a short-lived regional service of four trains in each direction per day, connecting the cities of Xanthi, Komotini, and Alexandroupolis in the region of Western Thrace.

In 2010, TrainOSE created the Proastiakos Patras service which runs on the old Athens-Patras line from Agios Andreas to Agios Vassileos.

In May 2020 TrainOSE updated its electronic ticketing system to support social distancing on all Proastiakos services. The system stopped selling tickets when capacity on that train had reached 50 percent, TrainOSE CEO Filippos Tsalidis told reporters during a press briefing on safety measures to prevent Covid-19 infection during travel.

==Athens Suburban Railway==


The Athens Suburban Railway consists of five routes: Piraeus–Airport via Athens, Piraeus–Kiato via Athens, Athens–Chalcis via Oinoi, Ano Liosia–Airport via Koropi, and Aigio–Athens/Airport via Kiato. Trains run from 4:30 am to midnight daily, and there are 53 stations in total.

On 18 January 2012, services were &quot;temporarily&quot; suspended on routes from Piraeus - Ano Liossia. According to a TrainOSE spokesperson, the interruption is due to technical problems; however no information on the progress of any work was given, services were rerouted via SKA.

The following table lists the routes and the stations for the Athens Suburban Railway since 15 May 2022:

===Connections===
The suburban railway connects with the other urban railways of Athens at the following stations:
* Piraeus: The suburban station is located close to the Metro Line 1 terminus, as well as the Metro Line 3 station.
* Athens Central Station: connection with Metro line 2.
* Neratziotissa: Connection with Metro Line 1.
* Plakentias: connection with Metro line 3.
* Kato Acharnes: connecting the line Kiato-Piraeus with Piraeus-Airport and Chalcis-Athens.
* Acharnes (SKA): passengers can transfer to the mainline and regional rail service of Greece. Also, connecting the Ano Liosia-Airport and Athens-Chalkis lines.
* Pallini: shared station with Metro line 3.
* Paiania–Kantza: shared station with Metro line 3.
* Koropi: shared station with Metro line 3.
* Airport: shared station with Metro line 3.
* Kiato: passengers can transfer to Hellenic Train bus services to Patras.

==Thessaloniki Suburban Railway==
 
The Suburban railway in Thessaloniki consists of three routes: one from Thessaloniki to Larissa, one from Thessaloniki to Florina. and one to Serres. Services run from approximately 5:00 am to midnight daily Thessaloniki Suburban Railway consists of three lines:

* Line 1 connects and , with some trains starting at .
* Line 2 runs between Thessaloniki and Florina, with some trains starting at .
* Line 3 connects and Serres.

Trains run from approximately 6:00 am to 22:00 pm daily on a fairly irregular basis, roughly once an hour. Both lines, however, somewhat complement each other between Thessaloniki and Platy. On 17 July 2014 services were cut back from eight to six services a day from Thessaloniki To Edessa.


===Connections===
* Thessaloniki: future connection to Thessaloniki Metro

Services towards Larissa also connect to the following long-distance and regional rail services:
* Platy: passengers can transfer to the regional rail service of Western Macedonia (towards Verroia, Edessa, Amyntaio, Florina and Kozani).
* Larissa: passengers can transfer to the mainline and regional rail service as well as trains to Volos.
Services towards Serres also connect to the following long-distance and regional rail services:
* Serres: passengers can transfer to the regional rail service to Central Macedonia (towards Gazoros and Alexandroupoli)

==Patras Suburban Railway==

Suburban railway of Patras consists of two routes. The first route from Agios Andreas station to the eastern suburb of Agios Vasileios began service on July 9, 2010. The route sees high passenger numbers as it serves the University of Patras and densely populated neighbourhoods and suburbs that are poorly served by other means of transport. For that reason, a bus shuttle service runs from Kastellokampos to the General University Hospital of Patras and the University of Patras campus. Trains run hourly from 6:23 in the morning until 23:23 in the evening, on both directions, every day. It serves 8 stations:

*Agios Andreas (Interchange station with the Kato Achaia line)
*Agios Vasileios
*Agyia
*Aktaion
*Bozaitika
*Kastellokampos (bus shuttle to University of Patras and General University Hospital)
*Patras Central Station 
*Rio

Due to upgrade works on the Athens - Patras line, the section between Agios Vasileios and Rio has been closed, so trains now terminate at Rio station. However, a bus replacement service from Kastellokampos serves both Aktaion and Agios Vasileios. Plans also have been proposed to bring the section underground in central Patras.

The following table lists the routes and the stations for Patras Suburban services are:

On February 29, 2020, passenger services began on the second route, extending from Agios Andreas all the way to Kato Achaia. The extension runs on part of the old single meter-gauge Patras-Pyrgos line.

In the early phase of operation, trains run from Kato Achaia to Patras Central Station. They will be departing from Patras Central Station every 2 hours from 6:37 to 14:37 and then from Kato Achaia Station every 2 hours from 7:41 to 15:41.

For the first three days of operation (29/02-02/03) the early morning services of 6:37 and 7:41 will not be run, although a back and forth journey at 16:37 to Kato Achaia and at 17:41 to Patras Central Station is going to be run. This special schedule is organised in order to help visitors move around the city and its suburbs during the Patras Carnival going on that weekend.

Although regular passenger service will not see trains running in the evening, it is expected that from May onwards, when the tourist and summer season begins, trains will run hourly back and forth in order to accommodate the increased passenger flows towards the popular summer spots in Western Achaia.

The extension is 22 km long and has 11 stops. These are:

*Patras Central Station
*Agios Andreas (Interchange station with the Rio line)
*Odos Antheias (&quot;Antheias Street&quot;)
*Ities
*Paralia
*Midilogli
*Vrachneika
*Tsoukaleika(*)
*Kaminia
*Alissos
*Kato Achaia

(*)A bus shuttle service will run from Tsoukaleika to the Patras Industrial Area, serving people who work there.

The total journey time from end to end is around 30 minutes with a top speed of 75 km/h, although the line has the capacity to run at 90 km/h.

Fares

The price for a standard ticket is €1,40(€1 reduced ticket). However, the fare is expected to change after March 2, as a new fare and zone policy will take effect as follows:

Zone A: Rion - Agios Andreas

Zone B: Patras Central/Agios Andreas - Tsoukaleika

Zone C: Tsoukaleika - Kato Achaia

The bus shuttle/replacement services are included in the same ticket. This means passengers do not have to pay more than the standard (or reduced) fare of €1,40 (or €1) to use both the train and the bus.

===Changes on the Kato Achagia Line (South Sector)===

Shortly after services started on the line, major changes were made. Bad line enclosure prohibited high speeds (less than 50km/h) on the section from Patras Central to Midilogli station, which in turn made connections between the two lines slow and inefficient. These two factors and poor advertising of the new service did not produce big passenger numbers. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown imposed made things worse for that line, and shortly after, services were suspended indefinitely.

On July 9, 2020, Proastiakos Patras celebrated its 10th birthday. Five days earlier, on 4th July, after the lockdown was lifted, services on the South sector recommenced, albeit on a shorter route. In order to maximize connection efficiency with the North sector (Rion-Agios Andreas), the route was altered to service the section between Agios Andreas and Kaminia. Alissos and Kato Achagia stations remain inactive to this day. However, works on safeguarding the line have been since going on, with new fences surrounding the line on key parts where it is otherwise problematic.
When works are finished, it is expected that trains will reach speeds of 50km/h between Agios Andreas and Midilogli, the section on where such speeds were previously prohibited. This increase in speed should allow trains to reach the original terminus in Kato Achagia in less than 30 minutes, reinstating the original extension with a more than reliable, fast, and efficient connection with Patras and the North sector of the system.

The new service from Agios Andreas to Kaminia saw trains initially run hourly from 6:30 till 15:00. On October 10, the timetables changed and trains are since running hourly again, from 6:30 till 18:00.

The fare system has changed, too, as the previously mentioned 3-zone fare policy was suspended indefinitely. Both lines are a single fare zone. The standard fare is €1,40, and the reduced fare is €1.00.

==Rolling stock==

Proastiakos uses rolling stock owned by GAIAOSE and maintained by Hellenic Train. Currently multiple units are used almost exclusively. Siemens Desiro 5-car electric multiple units (EMU) are used for Piraeus - Athens - Airport, Piraeus - Athens - Kiato, Athens – Chalkis and Thessaloniki - Larisa services, while Stadler GTW-2/6 and MAN-2000 diesel two-car multiple units (DMU-2) are used for the Patras-Rio and Patras-Kato Achagia services. As these DMUs have limited passenger carrying capacity, two or three DMUs are coupled together, when rolling stock availability allows it.

In late 2020 however, TrainOSE announced plans to purchase new rolling stock which will consist of double decker EMU&#x27;s, preferably from the Italian market. 

==Fares==

Standard tickets (€1,40), valid on all urban buses and trains, are also valid on Proastiakos trains between Piraeus, SKA, Koropi and Magoula. Higher fares apply for travel to the Airport, between Magoula and Kiato; and between Thessaloniki and Larisa. A one-way ticket from Piraeus or central Athens to the Airport costs €8 (7.9 on line) and a return ticket €16 (15.5 on line).

Tickets must be validated on special ticket validation machines on the platform, before boarding the train. Return tickets must be re-validated before boarding a return train. There are no ticket validation machines on the trains.

==Future plans==

Addition of new routes and stations to Proastiakos services depends on the progress of a number of OSE infrastructure projects in Attica. The most important projects are:

* Construction of a three or four-track line between Rouf and SKA stations.
* Electrification of lines between Piraeus and SKA.
* Installation of signalling on lines between Piraeus and SKA.
* Construction of ten passenger platforms and one &quot;through track&quot; at Athens Central station.
* Construction of new stations at Tavros, Pyrgos Vasilissis, Lykotrypa, and Zevgolatio.

As of April 2011, the introduction of new and more frequent services is mainly hindered by limited line capacity between Rouf and SKA, and limited availability of diesel rolling stock for the non-electrified line.

===Section: Piraeus – S.K.A.===

A number of new stations and halts are under construction on this line and they shall be served by Proastiakos trains:

*Athens (Athens Central Railway Station): The station is extended with new platforms to serve future suburban services. Completed as of August 2017.
*Agioi Anargyroi: New four platform station served by mainline and suburban trains, plus a freight siding. The fast line platforms are already operational and are served by Suburban Railway and Athens-Chalkis trains. The slow lines are under construction.
*Pyrgos Vasilissis: Is open after the slow lines between Agioi Anargyroi and SKA are operational.
*Lykotrypa: Is open after the slow lines between Agioi Anargyroi and SKA are operational.
*Acharnai Railway Center (SKA): The station is partly open since 2011-04-05, extensive work is still required to finish the first phase of the complex.

===Section: SKA – Koropi - Lavrio ===
The extension to Lavrio will mostly follow the alignment of the old Athens to Lavrio metric gauge line, which closed to passengers in 1957 and to goods in 1962. Most of the old alignment is still intact, and several bridges, all station buildings as well as the tracks themselves on many locations, are still in situ, but will need to be replaced as they were designed for a single metric gauge line, while the new one will be standard gauge and double-track for most of its length. The new line will branch off the airport line just beyond Koropi station, where existing infrastructure for a possible extension is already in place.

New stations will be built at:
*Markopoulo
*Kalyvia
*Kouvaras
*Keratea
*Kalopigado
*Thoriko
*Lavrio
*Port of Lavrio
or near the same site as their predecessors, the buildings of which, most of them listed structures, will hopefully be preserved. The line will be electrified upon inauguration. 

===Section: SKA – Pallini - Rafina ===
Future services to Rafina will be on new lines, currently securing funds. The line to Rafina shall branch off after Pallini station and will partly run on the central reservation of the Hymittus Ring Road. The stations will be:
*Pikermi
*Kallitechnoupoli
*Rafina

===Section: SKA – Corinth / Kiato / Aigio / Patras / Loutraki===
The existing line to Kiato has been extended to Aigio. The extension to Patras is under construction. A branch line to Loutraki is under construction.
* Zefyri: A new station to serve a future sports center.
* Xylokastro: New station with two platforms and pass-through line.
* Aigio: New station with three platforms.
* Loutraki branch:
**Isthmos
**Loutraki

===Section: SKA – Halkida / Thiva===
These stations are on the existing mainline and are served by regional and mainline trains. They shall be served by Proastiakos suburban trains in the future, when electrification and adequate line capacity are available between Athens and SKA.
*Acharnai Railway Center (SKA)
*Acharnes
*Dekeleia
*Agios Stefanos
*Afidnes
*Sfendali
*Avlonas
*Agios Thomas
*Oinofyta
*Oinoi, Junction to Chalkis (Oinoi–Chalcis railway)

**Avlis
**Steno
**Halkida
*Tanagra
*Elaion
*Ypaton
*Thiva

<text>Brimham Rocks, once known as Brimham Crags, is a 183.9-hectare (454-acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Geological Conservation Review (GCR) site, 8 miles (13 km) north-west of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England, on Brimham Moor in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The site, notified as SSSI in 1958, is an outcrop of Millstone Grit, with small areas of birch woodland and a large area of wet and dry heath.

Brimham Rocks has SSSI status because of the value of its geology and the upland woodland and the acidic wet and dry heath habitats that support localised and specialised plant forms, such as chickweed wintergreen, cowberry, bog asphodel and three species of heather.

The site is known for its water- and weather-eroded rocks, which were formed over 325 million years ago and have assumed fantastic shapes. In the 18th and 19th centuries, antiquarians such as Hayman Rooke wondered whether they could have been at least partly carved by druids, an idea that ran concurrently with the popularity of James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Fragments of Ancient Poetry&quot; of 1760, and a developing interest in New-Druidism. For up to two hundred years, some stones have carried fanciful names, such as Druid&#x27;s Idol, Druid&#x27;s Altar and Druid&#x27;s Writing Desk.

==Site location and SSSI designation==

Brimham Rocks is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Geological Conservation Review (GCR) site, south of Ripon on Brimham Moor in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in North Yorkshire. It is north of Summerbridge and east of Pateley Bridge and the River Nidd. The site is managed by the National Trust along with a visitor&#x27;s centre, public facilities and a car park. Brimham Rocks is open throughout the year between around 8.30 am and dusk, but on 21 March 2020 closed due to the coronavirus outbreak in the United Kingdom. The site reopened fully in the summer of 2021, following the lifting of the UK Government measures to deal with COVID-19.

The site was SSSI notified in 1958, with revisions in 1984 and on 19 February 1988. The site was listed for the value of its geology and because the &quot;heath and bog habitats represent important examples of plant communities, formerly more widespread, which have been reduced by agricultural improvement, drainage and afforestation.&quot; Associated with the more well-known rocky outcrops, are birch woodland, acidic bogs, wet and dry heath, and plant communities which thrive when sheltered between the rocks and exposed on the moor.

==Geology==

Brimham Rocks are formed from a medium to coarse sandstone known both as the Lower Brimham Grit and also as the Lower Plompton Grit, one of a series of such sandstones laid down in the later part of the Carboniferous period in what is now the Pennine region. In formal terms this particular grit which is between 10 and 30m thick, forms a part of the Hebden Formation, itself a sub-unit of the Millstone Grit Group. It was deposited 318-317 million years ago during the Kinderscoutian substage of the Bashkirian stage. The rock which has traditionally been referred to as Millstone Grit, originated as river-deposited sands in a delta environment and contains both feldspar and quartz pebbles. Deposition from moving water has resulted in the cross-bedding which is very evident in most of the outcrops. Brimham Rocks has been described as &quot;a classic geomorphological site, significant for studies of past and present weathering processes and their contribution to landscape evolution.&quot;
Although discussion continues around the formation and date of tors such as these throughout Britain, much of the development into the forms displayed at Brimham is likely to have taken place over the last 100,000 years before, during and after the last ice age – the Devensian. Some disintegration of the rock strata may have occurred along weaknesses such as fault and fracture planes whilst still buried. Sub-aerial weathering has continued the process. The outcrops were exposed when glacial action, gelifluction and further weathering and water erosion removed the loose material which separated them.

During periods of harsher climate, windblown-ice as well as particles of sand and dust have more effectively eroded weaker layers to give rise to these wind-carved shapes. Such processes have created holes in some rocks, and left dust on the ground below. Erosion continues, caused by weather and tourist numbers. One possibility for the mushroom shape of some stones is that they were exposed to sandblasting at ground level when an ice cap melted 18,000 years ago, narrowing the bases of outcrops, then they were subject to all-over sandblasting when the ice had gone, causing the irregular shapes. Due to this process the Idol rock, for example, will not exist for ever.

===Druidic theories===

It was not until the early 20th century that it was understood that the rocks were created by natural forces. During the 18th and 19th centuries, some writers theorised that the rock-shaping could have been enhanced by Druidic carving. Their theories coincided with the growth of Neo-Druidism, and followed the 1760 publication of James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Fragments of Ancient Poetry&quot;. After a lecture in 1786, the opinion of the antiquary Hayman Rooke was reported in 1788 with mild scepticism by the &quot;Sheffield Register&quot;: 

In 1844, Druidic theories were strong enough for the &quot;Worcester Journal&quot; to publish a list of &quot;British monuments, commonly called Druidical,&quot; to correct misunderstandings, including those by &quot;antiquarian writers of celebrity.&quot; The list included the Rock Idol at Brimham Rocks. Lewis&#x27;s 1848 &quot;Topographical Dictionary&quot; describes the area: &quot;... at Brimham are masses of vast rocks spread in the wildest profusion over a tract of nearly 40 acres, the ancient resort of the Druids&quot;. By 1849 John Richard Walbran, writing about erosion as the cause of the rocks&#x27; shapes, hesitated to support Druidical theories.

Nevertheless, in 1849, Druidic theories were still influential. John Williams (Ab Ithel), described Brimham Rocks in a poetic manner as if they were partly created by the hand of man: &quot;Brimham Rocks, where amidst great natural acclivities, and on the verge of precipices, ancient architects of the school of the builders of the Tomb of Laius, seem to have derived an intense pleasure in vanquishing and triumphing over the difficulties which nature opposed to their exertions.&quot;

By 1890 Druidic theories were dying out, leaving some rock names to bear witness to past ideas. The &quot;Pateley Bridge &amp; Nidderdale Herald&quot; quoted from Professor Phillips&#x27; &quot;Geology of Yorkshire&quot;: 

===Rock names===

Many of the rock names have been used for over a hundred years. Some fanciful names may have been invented by the Rocks House caretakers in their efforts to amuse visitors. Some appear to have been inspired by antiquarians who adhered to Druidical theories about their origins. Just a few names, such as the Noonstone whose shadow indicated midday, and old local names, Great Cannon and Little Cannon (now the Smartie Tube), may come from an earlier tradition. In his 1786 lecture, &quot;Some account of the Brimham rocks in Yorkshire&quot;, Hayman Rooke mentions the Idol Rock, the Great Cannon, and the Noonstone next to which a fire was lit on Midsummer Eve.

In 1844 the &quot;Worcester Journal&quot; mentions the Rock Idol, and in 1843 the &quot;Leeds Times&quot; mentions the Rocking Stones, Lovers&#x27; Leap, Baboon&#x27;s Head, Pulpit Rock, Parson&#x27;s Head, Yoke of Oxen, Frog and Tortoise, Serpent&#x27;s Head, Dancing Bear, Druid&#x27;s Writing Desk, Druid&#x27;s Aerial Altar, Druid&#x27;s Coffin, Sphinx, Oyster Shell, Mushroom, Idol Rock, and Cannon Rocks. In 1849 J.R. Walbran mentions the Rocking Stones and illustrates the Anvil and Porpoise Head. In 1906 the writer Harry Speight mentions the Elephant Rock, the Porpoise Head, the Dancing Bear, the Boat Rock, the Idol and the Rocking Stones. The identity of the Porpoise Head rock has been forgotten, although it appears in a drawing by Walbran.

The mention of Druids appears in &quot;Brimham Rocks, the wonder of Nidderdale&quot; () by journalist Herbert W. Ogle (1871–1940) of Otley. He lists Druid&#x27;s Head, Druid&#x27;s Writing desk, Druid&#x27;s Castle, Druid&#x27;s Pulpit, Druid&#x27;s Parlour, Druid&#x27;s Kitchen, Druid&#x27;s Coffin, Druid&#x27;s telescope &quot;and so on.&quot; The Parlour and Kitchen no longer exist. At the far end of the Eye of the Needle were once the Druid&#x27;s Caves, which included a Parlour and Bedroom, but they have been exposed or obliterated by a rock fall. Other rock names mentioned in 1920 are Oyster Shell, Rocking Stones, Baboon Rock, Mushroom Rock, Wishing Rock, Yoke of Oxen, Boat Rock (also known as the Druid&#x27;s Altar), Boat Rocking Stone (&quot;first discovered to be movable in 1786&quot;), Dancing Bear, Rhinoceros Head, Anvil Rock, Pivot Rock, Lovers&#x27; Leap, Frog and Tortoise, Cannon Rocks, Split Rock, Sphinx Rock, Rabbit Rock, Elephant&#x27;s Head, Dog Rock (possibly the Watchdog) and Tiger&#x27;s Head.

In his &quot;Guide to Brimham Rocks&quot; published in 1863, local historian William Grainge wrote &quot;These names are frequently changed by the innovating, garrulous guide, who has changed the &quot;Baboon&#x27;s Head&quot; to the &quot;Gorilla&#x27;s&quot;, and the &quot;Yoke of Oxen&quot; to the &quot;Bulls of Babylon&quot;, which unsettling of nomenclature he calls keeping pace with the times. Unique as the rocks are amongst the freaks of nature, there is nearly as much originality about the &quot;guide&quot; but infinitely less grandeur.&quot;

In 2020 the National Trust produced &quot;Spot the Rocks&quot;, a discovery trail sheet for children, listing eleven of the rock names. Some recent rock names in use are Meerkat and Smartie Tube.

==Biological site content==
Peat was once dug on Brimham Moor. Heather-burning, grazing, management for shooting, and air pollution from industrialisation plus two hundred years of footfall from visitors, has limited biodiversity especially around the rocky outcrop. Some of the heath has not been affected.

===Flora===
At the east side of the Brimham Rocks site cowberry grows, it is &quot;a northern species found mostly in Yorkshire.&quot; On the dry heathland by the rocks, on shallow soil with sand, grows a scattering of oak, rowan and silver birch, although its main cover is wavy hair-grass, bilberry, bell heather and ling, with bracken under the rock stacks. Birch grows on the north-east side in a regenerating forest. Until at least 1920, crowberry used to grow here. In the north woodland is chickweed wintergreen, which is &quot;uncommon&quot; and &quot;of note.&quot;

At the southern end of the site is wet heath which has shallow soil with peat, and a beck, and this habitat supports wood horsetail, marsh thistle, water blinks, marsh violet, and &quot;Yorkshire&#x27;s largest colonies of bog asphodel.&quot; The heath contains wet patches within the dry area where it is possible to find cranberry. Other wet heath plants are cross-leaved heath, bog mosses, purple moor-grass, deer grass and common cotton grass.

===Fauna===
Three kinds of deer are found on Brimham Moor: red deer, roe deer and sika deer.

====Birds====
National Trust rangers and volunteers monitor birds and bird boxes. The bird boxes have attracted tawny owl, treecreeper, spotted flycatcher (RSPB red-listed), redstart (RSPB amber listed), nuthatch, pied flycatcher, great tit and blue tit. Raptors seen over the rocks include: red kite, buzzard and kestrel. House martins and swallows fly around the rocks in summer, and on the heath are meadow pipit and red grouse. In February 2014, members of Harrogate District Naturalists&#x27; Society (HDNS) reported stonechat, wren and snipe.

===Invertebrates===
Green hairstreak and holly blue butterflies are among the protected creatures here. Invertebrates supported by heather around the rocks include green tiger beetle and the solitary bee &quot;Colletes succinctus&quot;.

==Maintenance==
The National Trust has a Countryside and Community Manager at Brimham Rocks to oversee maintenance. On all habitats on this site, fertiliser and pesticides would harm the flora and fauna, and should not be used. The use of herbicide is discouraged, it should be used with &quot;extreme care.&quot; A selective herbicide is used on bracken, however.

A high proportion of the Brimham Rocks site is recognised common land, where local farmers may graze their livestock. National Trust wardens work the year round to maintain this site. The work includes maintaining visitor paths and roads, bird-recording, controlling bracken and silver birch, and removing litter and storm-damaged trees.

===Rocks===
Where appropriate, the rocks should be kept clear of vegetation and rock debris, so that the geology remains visible. Building developments and trees should not conceal the exposed rocks. &quot;Widespread rock climbing activities and high visitor numbers ... need to be balanced with the protection of the rock features.&quot; Collecting of geological specimens is not allowed.

===Heath===
The plants on both wet and dry upland heath have developed a requirement for acidic and nutrient-poor soil, which is at least partially affected by underlying layers of Sphagnum moss, or peat. Thus the prevalent mixture of low shrubs, heather and cottongrass will support a large number of animals and insects. Careful maintenance of dry heath requires just enough livestock grazing to keep down trees and shrubs, but minimum winter grazing to protect those same shrubs. Animal feed should not be placed on this habitat because its detritus and animal dung would enrich the soil. Where necessary, grazing should be temporarily withheld, to allow the vegetation to recover. Although as of 2020 local farmers have not used their grazing rights recently, the National Trust may reintroduce this heath maintenance method.

Most wet heaths require little management, but if necessary a little light grazing may be used to prevent encroachment of trees and shrubs. Heavy grazing should be avoided on wet heath because it damages the peaty soil. Heather-burning should only take place with the agreement of English Nature, because burning can destroy adjacent woods, destroy some plants, destroy cover for certain nesting birds, encourage erosion, and encourage dominance of bracken and gorse. Cutting, if done without machinery, is a good alternative to burning, because it preserves the soil. Artificial drainage of wet heath is discouraged, because it would change the nature of the habitat.

===Woodland===
This is upland, semi-natural woodland. The clean air and high rainfall have made it a habitat for flora and fauna which is less commonly found in lowland woodland. However, beneficial previous and present management of this woodland has protected it from overgrazing, allowing plants and animals to proliferate. Where appropriate, woodland may be protected from livestock by fencing, it may be partially coppiced to let in light, or trees may be allowed to grow and die naturally. Invasive, not-native plants such as rhododendron should be removed. Wet woodland should be left alone where possible, allowing trees to grow and fall naturally. Any underplanted conifers should be removed. The mix of plants where the woodland and heath blend should be retained.

==Development and risk assessment==
For assessment, Natural England has divided the site into five units. Numbers one (), two () and four () are described as upland dwarf shrub heath, and units three () and five () are upland broadleaved mixed and yew woodland.

The units were assessed in 2012 and 2013, when all units were adjudged unfavourable and recovering, except unit 4 which was favourable. Plans for management of units 1 and 2 were in place, and recovery was expected. That left woodland units 3 and 5 still with problems. Woodland from unit 3 was encroaching onto unit 1 (supposed to be heath). Unit 3 had not enough ground flora, although it did have naturally regenerating trees. The problem with woodland unit 5 is that there was almost no understorey, and not enough ground cover plants, although it did have some new saplings. Both wood units 3 and 5 had some encroaching bracken. Unit 4, the visitor attraction with the rocks, was considered favourable because visitor damage did not appear noticeable, and there were not too many plants concealing the geology. The trees which conceal views from the rocks were not mentioned. Nevertheless, the rocky part of the site receives more than 175,000 people including families, climbers, naturalists and others every year, and this does affect the biodiversity of the rocky section.

On 17 February 2018 at Brimham Rocks the Police, the North Yorkshire National Parks and the RSPB launched Operation Owl, &quot;an initiative to tackle the illegal persecution of birds of prey in the county. This was because North Yorkshire had the highest raptor persecution record in the country, and they wanted to do &quot;random swoops&quot; in places where they believed this might be happening. They were also asking the public to report &quot;illegal pole traps, poisoned bait and habitat disturbance, associated with &quot;shooting interests.&quot; Pole traps are &quot;spring-loaded traps fixed to the top of posts which have been outlawed since Victorian times.&quot; The traps themselves are legal for catching vermin (e.g. rats) if used low on the ground and in tunnels, but are illegal on poles where birds will be killed.

In September 2018 a group of climbers assisted the National Trust in &quot;to return many of the locations between Cubic Block and Titfield Thunderbolt at Brimham to their previous airy and open state,&quot; that is, they removed large trees and other growth which had caused obstructions to the climbing experience at Brimham Rocks.

At 8.45 pm on 1 June 2018, in &quot;an act of mindless destruction,&quot; five youths were observed destroying one of Brimham Rocks&#x27; balancing stones by pushing it from its high spot so that it broke on the ground. The balancing stone had taken 320 million years to form by erosion.

==Site history==
Hayman Rooke found barrows and stone circles in this area before 1786: 

Katie Croft, in the National Trust guidebook, &quot;Brimham Rocks&quot; (2009), says that these barrows have not been found. The name, &quot;Birnebeam,&quot; or &quot;Birnebaha&quot;, meaning &quot;tree in clearing,&quot; refers to Brimham in the Domesday Book of 1086. Fountains Abbey owned it as pasture by 1252, and had a fishpool, then at the Reformation it reverted to The Crown from the 1530s. It was granted to Richard Gresham, then in 1780 Lord Grantley bought it. Brimham Moor was fox-hunting country by the 18th century, used by Colonel Thornton&#x27;s Hunt. Later, around 1827, the Earl of Harewood&#x27;s foxhounds would meet at the crossroads on Brimham Moor, making it possible to hunt across the Rocks since there could be no standing crops there.

In April 1842 several newspapers voiced disappointment that &quot;the appearance of that beautiful spot called Brimham Rocks ... has been greatly injured by the burning off of all the moss &amp;c. with which they were formerly covered.&quot; The identity of the offenders was unknown. In early May of the same year, vandals set the moorland around Brimham Rocks on fire several times, taking advantage of a severe drought.

A newspaper report of 1846 gives a glimpse of local life and an odd reference to Brimham Rocks. At an August Ripon Race meeting, a nameless five-year-old brown mare, who was both a hunter and also a daughter of Sheet Anchor, was disqualified after some drama. 

===Crime===
In August 2014 the body of Gemma Simpson was found at Brimham Rocks. That December Martin Bell, who had schizophrenia, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and was sentenced to a minimum of twelve years&#x27; imprisonment. In May 2000 he had smoked cannabis with her, &quot;bludgeoned and stabbed&quot; her to death, left her in a bath for some days, dismembered her, then buried her body at a secret location at Brimham Rocks for fourteen years. In July 2014 he confessed to the murder and disclosed the location of the body, at Scarborough police station.

==Poetry==

Poet Laureate Simon Armitage was commissioned by the National Trust to write a poem about the rocks. His &quot;Balancing Act&quot; is carved into a stone artwork of the same name created by artist Adrian Riley and stonemason Richard Dawson erected at the rocks in June 2023.

==Tourism==
===History of Rocks House===

This is a Grade II listed building, built in 1792 for Lord Grantley, who used it as a hunting lodge and &quot;for the accommodation of visitors,&quot; who came to see the rocks for their sublime aesthetic. The visitor&#x27;s centre, now called Brimham House, used to be called The Rocks House or Rock House, and between around 1792 and 1900 it was the home of Brimham Rocks&#x27; caretakers, and run as a souvenir shop, with an adjacent wooden tea house. In 1838, Rock House provided &quot;tea, coffee or luncheon ... lemonade, ginger beer and cigars ... hay, corn and good stabling for horses,&quot; plus the use of a telescope.

The building decayed and was temporarily replaced with a caravan as a makeshift café parked below the house steps, but in the 1970s the National Trust restored Rocks House. From 1987 there has been a shop and information centre at the house, which has been extended for staff accommodation, and fitted with solar panels. At some point in the 20th century, Rocks House was renamed Brimham House.

===Tenants, caretakers and guides===
John Spooner: John Spooner (–22 November 1819) was one of the earliest tourist guides here. His death-notice described him as &quot;the well-known guide at Brimham Rocks.&quot; He was 95 years old when he died, and he &quot;had been for more than thirty years successively the strangers&#x27; attendant at Brimham Rocks ... This veteran was very generally known.&quot;

Richard and Hannah Weatherhead: In late 1836, Rocks House tenants Richard (Hartwith ca.1802 – Pateley Bridge 1877) and Hannah (Hartwith ca.1796 – Pateley Bridge 1885) Weatherhead were fined £50 with £4 costs &quot;for selling spirituous liquors and tobacco without a licence.&quot; They had already been fined £25 that year for the same offence, but nevertheless paid up immediately. The &quot;Yorkshire Gazette&quot; said that &quot;it may be presumed that they have a pretty good trade.&quot; By 1862 the couple were providing guided tours, besides a continuation of the refreshment business at Rocks House, with teas besides &quot;refreshments.&quot; Richard Weatherhead used to recite Wordsworth while gesticulating with his stick, on the guided tours. J.R. Walbran (1849) described them as &quot;an original couple, who, for the customary remuneration, regale all comers with tea, coffee, and refreshments, in &quot;such&quot; Yorkshire style, as many of our fair southern friends will not readily forget.&quot;

William Brown: William Brown (Ripley ca.1852 – Brimham Rocks 24 May 1914) became tenant in 1882, using Rocks House for visitor entertainment, but farming locally at Mauds Farm. He had three sons, and ten daughters including Emma who did not speak. Oddly, the 1911 Census declares nine children only. Brown died aged 62 years on 24 May 1914 after hitching a lift on the side of a motor charabanc on its way to Rocks House: Brown died at Harrogate Infirmary, and was buried in St Jude&#x27;s churchyard, Hartwith. At the inquest, the jury recommended that the large North Eastern Railway motor charabancs should no longer be permitted to pass between the rocks between the entrance and Rocks House. There is at least one photograph of such a motor charabanc parked at Rocks House between 1902 and 1914.

Fred and Mary Ann Burn: The next tenants at Rocks House were Fred (Kilburn 1867 – Durham 1943) and Mary Ann Burn, who were in residence by 1920. Fred had previously been a drayman for a mineral water company near Doncaster. In the field in front of the house they grew produce, they fed the tourists in the Tea House, an ex-army hut placed next the house, and drew their water at Druid&#x27;s Cave Farm below the rocks, using a &quot;horse-drawn barrel&quot; to cart it uphill. In 1928 they caused some embarrassment by charging the Bishop of Ripon and his congregation sixpence per head to attend a service at the Rocks, without the knowledge of Sir William Aykroyd who owned the land. By 1937 they had moved to Durham, and were succeeded by their son-in-law Frank Dale and their daughter Doris at Rocks House, for a year.

Heslington William Robinson &quot;Essie&quot; Houseman: The new tenants in 1938 were farmer &quot;Essie&quot; Houseman (Hartwith 1871 – Dacre 1 August 1948), and his wife Annie (b. Hartwith ca.1877) of High Woods Farm, Brimham Moor and Gate Eel Farm, Dacre. It was under Houseman that the house &quot;fell into disrepair&quot;, while Essie continued to farm, his wife serving tea in summer from the Tea House. The Tea House was destroyed by fire in 1948, the year when Essie died. It was replaced by a caravan, where Mrs Carrick continued to provide the teas until 1970 when the National Trust assumed responsibility.

===Tourists and visitors===
The status of Brimham Rocks as a tourist attraction began in the late 18th and early 19th century, with about 100 visitors per year. It is still popular as a family venue and for rock climbing, with about 175,000 visitors per year as of 2009. In the late 18th century it was the Sublime aesthetic and the picturesque which inspired admiration for wonderfully strange shapes, and the great size of some of the rocks. In this vein a poem by F.C.S. appeared in the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; of 1826, describing a &quot;momentary view&quot; of the place. The following is an extract:

By the early 19th century, Romanticism was encouraging imagination and storytelling here. Both the Sublime and Romanticism are reflected in this 1843 report of an autumn ramble at Brimham Rocks: 

During the 19th century the Yorkshire Union of Mechanics&#x27; Institutes used to hold its annual conference at Ripon. One of the regular highlights following the procedures was an excursion to Studley Royal, Fountains Abbey and Brimham Rocks. On Wednesday 14 June 1848, the large party arrived with guides John Richard Walbran and Mr Harrison of Ripon, who brought not just &quot;antiquarian and topographical knowledge,&quot; but also &quot;taste.&quot; At Brimham rocks, after an &quot;excellent repast,&quot; the party &quot;rambled among the stupendous and fantastic rocks, observing the wonders of nature, and speculating on the extent to which the rude art of our earliest British ancestors might have aided the operations of water and air in producing the present extraordinary forms of the rocks.&quot; At this point they were not only joined by the memberships of local Mechanics&#x27; Institutes, but also (the event having been heralded in the newspapers) by hundreds of local working people who expected a lecture and received one: a twenty-minute talk on how to form their own mechanics&#x27; institutes. The &quot;Manchester Courier&quot; commented that, &quot;The motley group listened with interest and intelligence; and possibly even this &quot;handful of corn on the top of the mountain&quot; may be the seed of new institutes, which may train up yet unborn communities in the paths of knowledge and virtue.&quot;

===Tourist transport===

By the Harrogate spa Season of 1838, the summer tourists were arriving in hired carriages, and this was a business opportunity for postmaster Christopher Deighton. However he neglected, not for the first time, to pay the excise duty on the hire of a horse and phaeton in February of that year, and was fined £5 with 17 shillings costs. Magistrate C. Oxley said, &quot;Depend upon it if you go on in this way you will be convicted in the sum of £5 every time, therefore be careful, as it will take away all your profits.&quot;
By the 1840s, many carriages were hired to take people from Harrogate to Brimham Rocks. With the coming of the railways and a rail station at Dacre in 1862, visitors during the Season at Harrogate spa could more easily take excursions to Brimham Rocks, so tourist numbers increased. By 1906 there was a motor bus service from Dacre Banks Station, although a four-in-hand carriage could be hired from Harrogate.

During the 20th century and the early 21st century, visitor cars were parked among the rocks, but since 1970, the National Trust has maintained a car park near the entrance, and built an accessible pedestrian path to Rocks House (now called Brimham House or the Visitor Centre) from there.

===Tourist accidents===
Climbing on the Rocks is highly discouraged. A National Trust spokeswoman said in 2007: &quot;In the past 21 years we have had people fall from the rocks.&quot; She added:
On the National Trust Brimham Rocks website there is a warning: &quot;Climbing on the rocks can be dangerous and requires skill and special equipment. Please be aware of heights and sudden drops and keep children under close supervision.&quot; However, various accidents have been reported at the Rocks. These include:

* In May 2007 Ethan Bradley, a teenage boy on a Breckenbrough School field trip, got into difficulties while climbing the Rocks. His right leg was trapped above the ground on Oven Rock. It took the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service several hours to free him with specialist cutting equipment, and the boy was treated and airlifted by the Great North Air Ambulance. The National Trust said that &quot;it feels current warning signs are sufficient and does not plan further safety measures.&quot;
* On 13 February 2016 a 21-year-old man fell from a rock stack on the site and injured his back and pelvis. Ten members of the Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association (UWFRA) assisted the paramedics and stretchered the patient to a helicopter run by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance.
* In July 2017 a forty-year-old man received &quot;serious leg injuries&quot; having fallen from a rock stack at the site. The UWFRA assisted an ambulance crew, before the patient was airlifted to a hospital.
* In March 2020 a male climber aged 43 years was treated by the Yorkshire Ambulance Service at Brimham Rocks after he fell several metres, injuring his back. The UWFRA team carried him to a road ambulance.

==Climbing==

As of 2009, around 170 bouldering problems and 200 rock climbing routes have been recorded.

By 1920, climbers from Harrogate were already exploring routes up the rocks. Routes were first recorded from the 1930s, by Sidney Thompson and his colleagues, with perhaps 20 routes being put up by 1955. The first climbing guide to Brimham Rocks was published in 1956 in the form of an article in &quot;Yorkshire Ramblers&#x27; Club Journal.&quot; In 1957, various routes were recorded in the same journal, including Cracked Buttress, Lovers&#x27; Leap, Hatter&#x27;s Groove Group, Fag Slab, Hawk Crag, Cannon Rocks, Stelling Crag, Boulders and Bat Buttress. More difficult routes were recorded by the Yorkshire Mountaineering Club between 1957 and 1961, although some of their aid climbing methods are not used now. Local climbers Robin and Tony Barley were putting up new routes for ten years or more until the 1970s, being regularly chased off the rocks by the warden, on the grounds of unpaid entrance fees. From 1970 Leeds University Climbing Club began climbing here. Army cadet training takes place here, and from the 1990s climbers have visited the rocks for bouldering.

==Adjacent landmarks==
===Adam&#x27;s Ale spring===
This is one of the many springs outside the SSSI site, and just to the south-west of it. Its name is engraved on a nearby stone.
===Brimham Beacon===
Beacon Beacon is an ancient, natural promontory. It is just outside the Brimham Rocks SSSI border, at the south end, but being a high point contiguous with the site on Brimham Moor it is connected. Beacons for hilltop communication have been lit here for centuries. In 1803, around 26 such beacons were erected in the West Riding of Yorkshire, including one on Brimham Beacon. &quot;In the year 1887 on the day of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Jubilee, a great beacon fire was lit here, signalling to others in the distance.&quot;

===Cup and Ring stone===
This cup and ring stone, just west of the SSSI site, is a listed monument. The stone is over three metres long, it has about 21 cups or circular depressions, and some &quot;sinuous lines&quot; engraved on it.

===Noonstone===
The Noonstone, known locally as Noon Rock, is a natural rock stack just south-west of the Brimham Rocks SSSI site, and just east of the Adam&#x27;s Ale spring. It is on a high point, surrounded by trees, overlooking a small farm house or cottage to the north-north-east. Before the trees grew up, the rock used to cast a shadow on the cottage at noon. At least until the end of the 18th century, local people used to light fires next to the Noonstone on Midsummer Eve.

===Stone circle===
This is the lost stone circle mentioned by Hayman Rooke in 1786, and quoted in literature by other writers since, but apparently never seen by anyone since Rooke. Rooke placed it west of what is now the SSSI site, alongside some tumuli (which were never found either). A &quot;Druid&#x27;s Circle&quot; is marked on the 1854 OS six-inch map, a little way north-west of Rock House (now Brimham House) and just west of the trig point. However that position is occupied by natural rock stacks, some of which so happen to lie on a curved or semicircular line.

==Brimham Rocks in popular culture==
Maria Edgeworth&#x27;s novel &quot;Belinda&quot; uses Brimham Rocks as a setting of metaphorical balance and moral revelation to the 17-year-old protagonist Belinda Portman. The children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Roger and the Rottentrolls&quot; was filmed at Brimham Rocks and the site also features in the video for the Bee Gees&#x27; song &quot;You Win Again&quot;. A scene of series six of &quot;Knightmare&quot;, another children&#x27;s programme and adventure game show, saw Brimham Rocks used as a location.

==Notes==
==See also==
Another local area containing Millstone Grit rock stacks is Plumpton Rocks.

Other SSSIs in this area of North Yorkshire are: Bishop Monkton Ings, Cow Myers, Farnham Mires, Hack Fall Wood, Hay-a-Park, Kirk Deighton Mar Field Fen, Quarry Moor, and Ripon Parks.

<text>Ferranti, officially known as Ferranti International PLC, was a UK-based electrical engineering and equipment firm that operated for over a century, from 1885 until its bankruptcy in 1993. At its peak, Ferranti was a significant player in power grid systems, defense electronics, and computing, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

The company had an extensive presence in the defense sector, manufacturing advanced cockpit displays, radar transmitters, inertial navigation systems, and avionics for military aircraft, including the Tornado fighter jet. It was a pioneer in computer technology, launching the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1951, one of the world&#x27;s first commercially available computers.

Ferranti’s global footprint extended beyond the UK, with factories and branch plants in Scotland, Australia, Canada, Singapore, Germany, and the United States. The company had a strong presence in Edinburgh, with facilities at Silverknowes, Crewe Toll, Gyle, Granton, and Robertson Avenue, as well as an aviation facility at Turnhouse Airport.

Despite its eventual collapse, some parts of Ferranti’s legacy continue today. The Belgian subsidiary survives as Ferranti Computer Systems, now part of Nijkerk Holding since 1994. Other divisions were acquired by major corporations, including BAE Systems, Leonardo (formerly Finmeccanica), Ultra Electronics, Thales, and Elbit Systems, with some still operating under different names.

Even outside of business, Ferranti left a cultural mark. The Ferranti Edinburgh Recreation Club, the Ferranti Mountaineering Club, and the Ferranti Ten-Pin Bowling League continue to exist. Additionally, Ferranti Thistle F.C., originally founded in 1943, evolved into Livingston F.C., a team competing in the Scottish Professional Football League.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti established his first business Ferranti, Thompson and Ince in 1882. The company developed the Ferranti-Thompson Alternator. Ferranti focused on alternating current power distribution early on, and was one of the few UK experts. In 1885 Dr. Ferranti established a new business, with Francis Ince and Charles Sparks as partners, known as S.Z. de Ferranti. According to J.F. Wilson, Dr. Ferranti&#x27;s association with the electricity meter persuaded Ince to partner him in this new venture, and meter development was fundamental to the survival and growth of his business for several decades to come.

Despite being a prime exponent of alternating current, Ferranti became an important supplier to many electric utility firms and power-distribution companies for both AC and DC meters.
In 1887, the London Electric Supply Corporation (LESCo) hired Dr. Ferranti for the design of their power station at Deptford. He designed the building, the generating plant and the distribution system and on its completion in October 1890, it was the first truly modern power station. It supplied high-voltage AC power at 10,000 volts, which was transformed to a lower voltage for consumer use where required.

Success followed and Ferranti started producing electrical equipment (especially transformers) for sale. Soon the company was looking for considerably more manufacturing space. Land prices in the London area were too high, so the company moved to Hollinwood in Oldham in 1896. In July 1901, Ferranti Limited was formed, specifically to take over the assets of S.Z. de Ferranti Ltd and raise equity, but failed to impress potential new investors as it was still dominated by family ownership. Over-optimistic market projections in the boom of 1896–1903, declining revenues and liquidity problems, forced the company bankers Parrs to send the company into receivership in 1903.

The business was restructured in 1905, Dr. Ferranti&#x27;s shareholding being reduced to less than 10%. For the next eleven years the company was run by receiver managers and Dr. Ferranti was effectively excluded from commercial financial strategies. He spent much of this period working in partnership with the likes of J.P. Coats of Paisley on cotton spinning machinery and Vickers on re-superheating turbines.

===Expansion===
Through the early part of the century power was supplied by small companies, typically as an offshoot of plant set up to provide power to local industry. Each plant supplied a different standard, which made the mass production of domestic electrical equipment inefficient. In 1910, Dr. Ferranti made a presidential speech to the IEE addressing this issue, but it would be another sixteen years before the commencement of the National Grid in 1926.

In 1912, in a move driven by A.B. Anderson, the Ferranti Managing Director, Ferranti formed a company in Canada, Ferranti Electric, to exploit the overseas meter market. But in 1914, two significant events happened, Anderson drowned on his return from Canada in the Empress of Ireland sinking and the outbreak of WWI signalled an opportunity for Dr. Ferranti to once again get involved in day-to-day events in the company. He wanted to get involved in the manufacture of shells and fuzes but it wasn&#x27;t until 1915 that he finally convinced the board to accept this. As a result of this work Ferranti were in a healthier financial position at the end of the war.
High voltage power transformers became an important product for Ferranti; some of the largest types weighed over a hundred tons. Dr. Ferranti&#x27;s son Vincent joined the transformer department as manager in 1921 and was instrumental in expanding the work started by his father. After the death of Dr. Ferranti in 1930, he became the chairman and chief executive. In 1935, Ferranti purchased a disused wire drawing mill at Moston: from here it manufactured many &quot;brown goods&quot; such as televisions, radios, and electric clocks. The company later sold its radio and television interests to EKCO in 1957. Production of clocks ended in 1957 and other product lines phased out in 1960 Ferranti Instruments, based at Moston, developed various items for scientific measurements, including one of the first cone and plate viscometers. Ferranti built a new power transformer works at Hollinwood in the mid-1950s at a time when there was growth in the power supply distribution industry.

By 1974, Ferranti had become an important supplier to the defence industry, but its power transformer division was making losses, creating acute financial problems. This led to the company being bailed out by the government&#x27;s National Enterprise Board, taking a 65% share of the company in return. After restructuring, it was returned to the private sector in 1980 as a profitable company.

===Defence electronics===
During World War II, Ferranti became a major supplier of electronics, fuzes, valves, and was, through development of the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, heavily involved in the early development of radar in the United Kingdom. In the post-war era, this became a large segment of the company, with various branches supplying radar sets, avionics and other military electronics, both in the UK and the various international offices.
In 1943, Ferranti opened a factory at Crewe Toll in Edinburgh to manufacture gyro gunsights for the Spitfire aircraft. After the war they set up Ferranti Research to complement this business which grew to employ 8,000 staff in 8 locations, becoming the birthplace of the Scottish electronics industry, and a major contributor to company profitability. Later products included solid state ring laser gyros.

From 1949, Ferranti-Packard assisted the Royal Canadian Navy develop DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving). DATAR was a pioneering computerized battlefield information system that combined radar and sonar information to provide commanders with an &quot;overall view&quot; of a battlefield, allowing them to coordinate attacks on submarines and aircraft.

In the 1950s, work focused on the development of airborne radar, with the company subsequently supplying radars to most of the UK&#x27;s fast jet and helicopter fleets. Today the Crewe Toll site (now part of Leonardo S.p.A.) leads the consortium providing the Euroradar CAPTOR radar for the Eurofighter Typhoon.

In the 1960s and 1970s, inertial navigation systems became an important product line for the company with systems designed for fast jet (Harrier, Phantom, Tornado), space and land applications. The electro-mechanical inertial navigation systems were constructed at the Silverknowes site in Edinburgh. In addition to their other military and civil applications, they were used in the ESA Ariane 4 and first Ariane 5 launches. Ferranti also produced the PADS (Position and Azimuth Determining System), an inertial navigation system which could be mounted in a vehicle and was used by the British Army.

With the invention of the laser in the 1960s, the company quickly established itself in the electro-optics arena. From the early 1970s, it was delivering the &quot;Laser Rangefinder and Marked Target Seeker&quot; (LRMTS) for the Jaguar and Harrier fleets, and later for Tornado. It supplied the world&#x27;s first man-portable laser rangefinder/designator (Laser Target Marker, or LTM) to the British Army in 1974, and had notable successes in the US market, establishing Ferranti Electro-optics Inc in Huntington Beach, California. Its TIALD Pod (Thermal Imaging Airborne Laser Designator) has been in almost constant combat operation on the Tornado since it was rushed into service during the first Gulf War.

From the 1960s through to the late 1980s, the Bristol Ferranti Bloodhound SAM, for which Ferranti developed radar systems, was a key money earner.
In 1970, Ferranti became involved in the sonar field through its involvement with Plessey in a new series of sonars, for which it designed and built the computer subsystems. This work later expanded when it won a contract for the complete Sonar 2050. The work was originally carried out at the Wythenshawe factory and then at Cheadle Heath. Takeovers of other companies gave it expertise in sonar arrays. This business later became Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems.

The selection of the radar for the project that became the Eurofighter Typhoon became a major international issue in the early 1990s. Britain, Italy, and Spain supported the Ferranti-led ECR-90, while Germany preferred the MSD2000 (a collaboration between Hughes, AEG and GEC). An agreement was reached after UK Defence Secretary Tom King assured his German counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg that the British government would underwrite the project and allow GEC to acquire Ferranti Defence Systems from its troubled parent. Hughes sued GEC for $600 million for its role in the selection of the EFA and alleged that it used Hughes technology in the ECR-90 when it took over Ferranti. It later dropped this allegation and was awarded $23 million; the court judged that the MSD-2000 &quot;had a real or substantial chance of succeeding had GEC not tortuously intervened ... and had the companies, which were bound by the Collaboration Agreement, faithfully and diligently performed their continuing obligations thereunder to press and promote the case for MSD-2000.&quot;


===Industrial electronics===

The company began marketing optical position measuring equipment for machine tools in 1956. Moire fringes produced by diffraction gratings were the basis for the position measurement. In the late 1980s there were several sections of the company involved in non-military areas. These included microwave communications equipment (Ferranti Communications), and petrol (gas) station pumps (Ferranti Autocourt). Both of these departments were based at Dalkeith, Scotland.

===Computers===

In the late 1940s Ferranti joined with various university-based research groups to develop computers. Their first effort was the Ferranti Mark 1, completed in 1951, with about nine delivered between 1951 and 1957. The Pegasus introduced in 1956 was their most popular valve (vacuum tube) system, with 38 units sold. Circa 1956, Ivan Idelson, at Ferranti, originated the &quot;Cluff–Foster–Idelson coding&quot; of characters on 7-track paper tape for a BSI committee. This also inspired the development of ASCII.

In collaboration with the Victoria University of Manchester they built a new version of the famous Mark 1 that replaced valve diodes with solid state versions, which allowed the speed to be increased dramatically as well as increasing reliability. Ferranti offered the result commercially as the Mercury starting in 1957, and eventually sold nineteen in total. Although a small part of Ferranti&#x27;s empire, the computer division was nevertheless highly visible and operated out of a former steam locomotive factory in West Gorton.

Work on a completely new design, the Atlas, started soon after the delivery of the Mercury, aiming to dramatically improve performance. Ferranti continued their collaboration with the University of Manchester, and Plessey became a third partner. The second generation supercomputer first ran in December 1962. Eventually six machines were built, one of which was a stripped-down version that was modified for the needs of the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory; the Titan (or &quot;Atlas 2&quot;) was the mainstay of scientific computing in Cambridge for nearly 8 years. Atlas was the first computer in the world to implement virtual memory.

By the early 1960s their mid-size machines were no longer competitive, but efforts to design a replacement were bogged down. Into this void stepped the Canadian division, Ferranti-Packard, who had used several of the ideas under development in England to very quickly produce the Ferranti-Packard 6000. By this time Ferranti&#x27;s management was tired of the market and were looking for someone to buy the entire division. Eventually it was merged into International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) in 1963, becoming the Large Systems Division of ICL in 1968. After studying several options, ICT selected the FP 6000 as the basis for their ICT 1900 series line which sold into the 1970s.

The deal setting up ICT excluded Ferranti from the commercial sector of computing, but left the industrial field free. Some of the technology of the FP 6000 was later used in its Ferranti Argus range of industrial computers which were developed in its Wythenshawe factory. The first of these, simply &quot;Argus&quot;, was initially developed for military use.

Meanwhile, in Bracknell the Digital Systems Division was developing a range of mainframe computers for naval applications. Early computers using discrete transistors were the &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Poseidon&quot; and these were followed by the &quot;F1600&quot; in the mid-1960s. Some of these machines remained in active service on naval vessels for many years. The &quot;FM1600B&quot; was the first of the range to use integrated circuits and was used in many naval and commercial applications. The &quot;FM1600D&quot; was a single-rack version of the computer for smaller systems. An airborne version of this was also made and used aboard the RAF Nimrod. The &quot;FM1600E&quot; was a redesigned and updated version of the FM1600B, and the last in the series was the &quot;F2420&quot;, an upgraded FM1600E with 60% more memory and 3.5 times the processing speed, still in service at sea in 2010. 

===Semiconductors===

Ferranti had been involved in the production of electronic devices, including radio valves, cathode-ray tubes and germanium semiconductors for some time before it became the first European company to produce a silicon diode, in 1955. In 1972 they launched the ZN414, a single-chip AM radio integrated circuit in a 3-pin package.

Ferranti Semiconductor Ltd. went on to produce a range of silicon bipolar devices, including, in 1977, the Ferranti F100-L, an early 16-bit microprocessor with 16-bit addressing. An F100-L was carried into space on the amateur radio satellite UoSAT-1 (OSCAR 9). Ferranti&#x27;s ZTX series bipolar transistors gave their name to the inheritor of Ferranti Semiconductor&#x27;s discrete semiconductor business, Zetex Semiconductors plc.

In the early 1980s, Ferranti produced some of the first large uncommitted logic arrays (ULAs), used in home computers such as the Sinclair ZX81, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron and BBC Micro. The microelectronics business was sold to Plessey in 1988.

=== Acquisition of International Signal and Control ===
In 1987 Ferranti purchased International Signal and Control (ISC), a United States defence contractor based in Pennsylvania. The company subsequently changed its name to Ferranti International PLC. and restructured the combined business into the following divisions: Ferranti Computer Systems, Ferranti Defence Systems, Ferranti Dynamics, Ferranti Satcomms, Ferranti Telecoms, Ferranti Technologies and International Signal and Control.

===Collapse===
Unknown to Ferranti, ISC&#x27;s business primarily consisted of illegal arms sales started at the behest of various US clandestine organizations. On paper the company looked to be extremely profitable on sales of high-priced &quot;above board&quot; items, but these profits were essentially non-existent. With the sale to Ferranti all illegal sales ended immediately, leaving the company with no obvious cash flow.

In 1989 the UK&#x27;s Serious Fraud Office started criminal investigation regarding alleged massive fraud at ISC. In December 1991 James Guerin, founder of ISC and co-chairman of the merged company, pleaded guilty before the federal court in Philadelphia to fraud committed both in the US and UK. All offences which would have formed part of any UK prosecution were encompassed by the US trial and as such no UK trial proceeded.

The financial and legal difficulties that resulted forced Ferranti into bankruptcy in December 1993.

==Operations==
The company had factories in Greater Manchester at Hollinwood, Moston, Chadderton (Gem Mill), Waterhead (Cairo Mill), Derker, Wythenshawe, Cheadle Heath, West Gorton, and Poynton. Eventually it set up branch-plants in Edinburgh (Silverknowes, Crewe Toll, Gyle, Granton and Robertson Avenue factories, plus its own hangar facility at Turnhouse Airport), Dalkeith, Aberdeen, Dundee, Kinbuck (near Dunblane), Bracknell, Barrow in Furness and Cwmbran as well as Germany and the United States (inc. Ferranti International Controls Corporation
in Sugar Land, Texas) and several British Commonwealth countries including Canada, Australia and Singapore.

Ferranti Australia was based in Revesby, Sydney NSW. There was also a primarily defence-related branch office in South Australia.

Products manufactured by Ferranti Defence Systems included cockpit displays (moving map, head-down, head-up) video cameras and recorders, gunsight cameras, motion detectors, pilot&#x27;s night vision goggles, integrated helmets, and pilot&#x27;s stick controls.

On the Tornado aircraft, Ferranti supplied the radar transmitter, inertial navigation system, LRMTS, TIALD pod, mission recording equipment, and cockpit displays.

==Current ownership of former Ferranti businesses==
*Ferranti Autocourt: Acquired by Wayne Dresser, renamed to Wayne Autocourt, before Autocourt name dropped
*Ferranti Communications: Acquired by Thorn and branded Thorn Communications and Telecontrol Systems (CATS). Later acquired by Tyco International and renamed Tyco Communications. Still operating under the name TS Technology Services.
*Ferranti Computer Systems:The Belgian subsidiary lives on as Ferranti Computer System and as of 1994 is part of the Nijkerk Holding. The remainder was acquired out of administration by SYSECA, the IT arm of Thomson-CSF and renamed Ferranti-SYSECA Ltd.. Later, the Ferranti name was dropped and when Thomson changed its name to Thales Group, SYSECA became Thales Information Systems. Thales Information Systems later sold its German interest to Consinto Gmbh. The department dealing with airport systems was bought by Datel in around 1995 and continued to trade under the name Ferranti Airport Systems until it was bought by Ultra Electronics. Other parts of Ferranti Computer Systems were acquired out of administration by GEC-Marconi. When GEC-Marconi sold on its defence-related businesses to BAE Systems, many of these former Ferranti entities became part of the BAE/Finmeccanica joint venture called Alenia Marconi Systems. This JV has now been dissolved and the former Ferranti entities are now part of BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies (Insyte).
*Ferranti Defence Systems: Acquired by GEC-Marconi out of administration and renamed GEC Ferranti, later becoming part of GEC Marconi Avionics (GMAv). This business was acquired in 2000 by BAE Systems (BAE Systems Avionics). Part of this business, including the heritage Ferranti operation, was acquired by Finmeccanica in 2007 and renamed SELEX Galileo, then Selex ES, then becoming part of Leonardo. At one time there were design offices at Silverknowes, Robertson Avenue, South Gyle 1 and 2, Crewe Toll, Granton. After BAE Systems was formed the remaining factories at South Gyle were sold off and the staff made redundant despite their ground breaking work on the Avionics and Helmet for EFA and Aircraft Mission Computers.
*Ferranti Dynamics: Acquired by GEC-Marconi in 1992
*Ferranti Electronics (Ceramic Seals division): Acquired by Ceramic Seals Limited in 1990.
*Ferranti Instrumentation: Dissolved. Some assets acquired by GEC-Marconi and Ravenfield Designs
*Ferranti Tapchangers Ltd: Independent company, then acquired by UK-based grid control specialists Fundamentals Ltd Ferranti Tapchangers Ltd | Welcome in 2017
*Ferranti Satcomms: Acquired out of administration by Matra Marconi Space in 1994
*Ferranti Technologies: Was bought out by management and continues in Rochdale specialising in avionics, defence electronics, and electronic power systems. It was acquired by Elbit Systems in 2007. After direct action by Palestine Action targeting their Oldham site, it was sold to TT Electronics in January 2022, moving site to Rochdale at end of 2023.
*Ferranti Air Systems: Acquired by Datel then turned into an independent company. Later bought by Ultra Electronics. In 2019 acquired by ADB Safegate.
*Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems: A 50% share was acquired by GEC-Marconi. Now owned by Thales and renamed Thales Underwater Systems.
*Ferranti Helicopters: Acquired by British Caledonian Airways in April 1979 to become British Caledonian Helicopters which was in turn acquired by Bristow Helicopters in 1987
*Ferranti Subsea Systems: Management buyout in the early 1990s, renamed FSSL. Kværner bought more shares in 1994 and then turned to Kværner FSSL. Kværner is now known as Aker Solutions
*Ferranti Computer Systems Service Department: This was acquired by the third party maintenance company ServiceTec. The regional Service Centres were rebranded as ServiceTec and all of the service engineers and management were taken on. The support of the Argus computers dominated activities although new (non-Argus) business was added to the regional centres. The repair centre at Cairo Mill also became part of the ServiceTec group, ultimately as a separate entity.
*Ferranti Semiconductors: Became Zetex Semiconductors after a management buyout in 1989. In 2008 it was acquired by Diodes Inc.
*Ferranti Photonics Ltd.: Independent, liquidated after bankruptcy in 2005

==Other uses of the Ferranti name==
A number of uses of the Ferranti name remain in use. In Edinburgh, the Ferranti Edinburgh Recreation Club (FERC), the Ferranti Mountaineering Club and the Ferranti Ten-pin Bowling League are still in existence. While these organisations no longer have any formal ties with the companies which subsumed the Ferranti companies which operated in Edinburgh, they still operate under the old names.

Ferranti Thistle F.C. was formed in 1943 and joined the Scottish Football League in 1974. Due to strict sponsorship rules it changed its name to Meadowbank Thistle F.C., and later to Livingston F.C.

Denis Ferranti Meters Limited is still (2021) owned by a direct descendant of Sebastian de Ferranti but is not directly related to the major Ferranti corporation. The company has over 200 employees that manufacture BT&#x27;s public phones, oil pumps for large industrial vehicles, electric motors for motorbility solutions, electronics, and small MOD equipment.

<doc id="1124060" wikidata="Q977303" url="?curid=1124060" title="Victoria Mxenge">
<text>Victoria Nonyamezelo Mxenge (1 January 1942, in King William&#x27;s Town, Eastern Cape – 1 August 1985, in Umlazi, Durban, Natal) was a South African anti-apartheid activist; she was trained as a nurse and midwife, and later began practising law.

==Life==
Mxenge was born in Tamara Village on 1 January 1942 in King William&#x27;s Town to parents Wilmot Goso and Nobantu Ntebe. After completing her primary education at Tamara, she went to Forbes Grant Secondary School where she completed the junior certificate (Grade 10). In 1959, she matriculated at Healdtown, Fort Beaufort in the Eastern Province. She trained as a nurse at Victoria Hospital and earned her qualifications in 1964. After she married Griffiths Mxenge, she and her husband moved to Natal (now KwaZulu-Natal). She took midwifery at King Edward Hospital and worked as a community nurse in Umlazi. In 1965, her husband was convicted under the Suppression of Communism Act and was imprisoned for two years on Robben Island. During their marriage, her husband faced various government-sanctioned bans and detentions. She and her husband had two sons, Mbasa and Viwe, and daughter Namhla.

==Work==

After completing a midwifery course at King Edward Hospital, Victoria Mxenge worked as a community nurse at Umlazi Clinic. She then studied law through UNISA. In 1981, some five years after her husband had set up a legal practice she acquired legal qualifications, joined the practice and was subsequently admitted as an attorney. On 19 November 1981, her husband was brutally assassinated by Vlakplaas agents led by Dirk Coetzee in Umlazi township, south of Durban. He had multiple stab wounds and his body was found near the soccer field in Umlazi and it fell on her to identify his mutilated body at a government mortuary the morning after his murder. It was claimed by police general Dirk Coetzee that her husband was murdered by the African National Congress (ANC), which she vigorously refuted. The ANC issued a public statement from Lusaka decrying his murder and paying tribute to his contribution in the struggle. In 1996, Dirk Coetzee confessed that he led a group that killed Mxenge.

After her husband&#x27;s murder, Mxenge kept their law practice going. In 1983, she successfully defended students against the confiscation of their results by the Department of Education&quot;. She also intervened in cases in which the youth were ill-treated while imprisoned. Mxenge represented families of victims of the Matolo raid and Lesotho raid. Mxenge started a bursary fund in memory of her husband. She became a member of the Release Nelson Mandela Committee (RMC), sat on the executive of the National Organisation of Women (NOW) and the Natal Treasurer of the UDF.

Mxenge was part of the defence team for the UDF and Natal Indian Congress during the Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial at the Pietermaritzburg Supreme Court . In July 1985, she spoke at the funeral of The Cradock Four, Matthew Goniwe, Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkhonto and Sicelo Mhlauli. The funeral was attended by over 50,000 mourners. During her speech Mxenge condemned the apartheid government and referred to the murder of The Cradock Four as a &quot;dastardly act of cowardices.&quot;

==Murder==

On 1 August 1985, she was &quot;gunned down by four black men&quot; as she returned from a political meeting. She was killed on her driveway in Umlazi in front of her children. The men were thought to be part of a government &#x27;death squad&#x27;. After her death, more than 1,000 students marched in Durban in protest and were &quot;dispersed by police using dogs and clubs.&quot; 
Her funeral which was held on 11 August 1985 in Rayi Village near King William&#x27;s Town was attended by 10,000 people, and letters of condolence were received from Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo amongst others. After her funeral, mourners in Duncan Village took to the streets and vandalised public property. This resulted in clashes between the police and residents which left nine people dead and 138 injured.

In 1987, South African magistrates claimed that she had died from &quot;head injuries and had been murdered by person unknown&quot;. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Report on the assassination of Victoria Mxenge documents that Marvin Sefako (alias Bongi Raymond Malinga) was allegedly recruited by the security branch and that Brigadier Peter Swanepoel was his handler. Malinga confessed that he had killed Mxenge.

==Legacy==
In October 2005, the South African Ministry of the Environment launched the third and final s named Victoria Mxenge in her honor. In 2006 both Victoria Mxenge and her husband were posthumously awarded the Order of Luthuli in Silver for excellent contributions to the field of law and sacrifices made in the fight against apartheid in South Africa. The Victoria Mxenge Group of Advocates was officially established on 1 July 2011 and is part of the Johannesburg Society of Advocates. On 20 August 2017, the KwaZulu-Natal government and eThekwini Municipality unveiled statues in honour of Griffiths and Victoria Mxenge in uMlazi, south of Durban.

==In popular culture==
Victoria Mxenge was mentioned alongside other anti-apartheid activists Steve Biko and Neil Aggett in the 1987 song Asimbonanga by the South African band Savuka, composed by Johnny Clegg and dedicated to Nelson Mandela.

<doc id="1124070" wikidata="Q933745" url="?curid=1124070" title="Treaty of Osimo">
<text>The Treaty of Osimo was signed on 10 November 1975 by Italy and Yugoslavia in Osimo, Italy, to definitively divide the Free Territory of Trieste between the two states: the port city of Trieste with a narrow coastal strip to the north-west (Zone A) was given to Italy; a portion of the north-western part of the Istrian peninsula (Zone B) was given to Yugoslavia.

The full name of the treaty is Treaty on the delimitation of the frontier for the part not indicated as such in the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Peace Treaty of 10 February 1947]]. The treaty was written in French and became effective on 11 October 1977. For the Italian government, the treaty was signed by Mariano Rumor, Minister for Foreign Affairs. For Yugoslavia, the treaty was signed by Miloš Minić, the Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs.

==Criticism in Italy==
The Italian government was criticized harshly for signing the treaty, particularly for the secretive way in which negotiations were carried out, skipping the traditional diplomatic channels. Italian nationalists rejected the idea of giving up Istria since it had been an ancient &quot;Italian&quot; region together with the Venetian region (&quot;Venetia et Histria&quot;). Following the Treaty of London, Istria had belonged to Italy for the 25 years, 1919–1943, between World War I and the end of World War II, and the west coast of Istria had long had a sizeable Italian-minority population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valussi/Ressmann&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some called for the prosecution of the then Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the crime of treason, as stated in Article 241 of the Italian Criminal Code, which mandates a life sentence for anybody found guilty of aiding and abetting a foreign power to exert its sovereignty on the national territory. The treaty did not guarantee the protection of the Italian minority in the Yugoslav zone or for the Slovenian minority in the Italian zone. The question of the protection of minorities was already enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights which has its own powerful Court, nonetheless linguistic and office-holding qualification protections were enshrined in later signing of protocols. 

==Slovenian and Croatian independence==
Slovenia declared its independence in 1991 and was recognized internationally in 1992. Italy quickly recognised Slovenian independence and accepted the accession of the new Slovenia to treaties concluded with Yugoslavia. The treaty&#x27;s applicability was now in question, but Slovenia then released a declaration on 31 July 1992 saying that it would recognize the treaty.

Both Italy and Croatia have opposed any changes to the treaty. Slovenia claimed that all debts owing to Italy for property transferred to Yugoslav sovereignty after 1947 had now been paid. By 1993, however, 35,000 Italians still claimed that money was owed to them.

In 1994, the Italian government, led by Silvio Berlusconi, demanded that additional compensation be paid, or efforts to integrate Slovenia into Western Europe would be halted. To that effect, it blocked talks for Slovenia&#x27;s accession to the European Union until March 1995, when the new government, under Lamberto Dini, retracted the Italian demand. A cooperative pact was signed, led by Spain, with the effect of allowing Italian nationals who had resided in Slovenia for three years to purchase property there for up to four years after the pact was signed. It came into force during Slovenia&#x27;s attempts to join the EU.

No similar declaration was made by the Croatia government, but the Croatian Parliament on 25 June 1991 accepted the borders of Croatia as part of Yugoslavia. However, Italy did not insist on a declaration from Croatia, and the treaty was never questioned by Croatia, which considers it to be valid.

==Quotes==
Liuzhou appears in the Chinese saying .
:&quot;Born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou&quot;
because, in the past, the city was known for its coffins, made from firwood, camphor wood, and sandalwood, which are said to preserve the body after death. Guangzhou&#x27;s &quot;Cantonese&quot; cuisine is famous worldwide, and Hangzhou is known for its prosperity and the beauty of its location. Suzhou is reputed to have the most beautiful people in China, so the line is sometimes given as &quot;&quot;Marry in Suzhou&quot;...&quot;.

Today many tourists buy miniature coffins, about long, as souvenirs or good luck charms. The coffins are usually inscribed () which means &#x27;get promotion and get rich&quot;. The second and fourth characters are homophones of () meaning &#x27;coffin&#x27;.

Some miniature coffins are used as caskets to hold the ashes of ancestors.

<text>Fyodor Savelyevich Khitruk (3 December 2012) was a Soviet and Russian animator, animation director, screenwriter and pedagogue.

==Biography==
Khitruk was born in Tver into a Jewish family. He came to Moscow to study graphic design at the OGIS College for Applied Arts. He graduated in 1936 and started to work with Soyuzmultfilm in 1938 as an animator. From 1962 onward, he worked as a director. His first film &quot;The Story of a Crime&quot; was an immense success. Today, this film is seen as the beginning of a renaissance of Soviet animation after a two-decade-long life in the shadows of socialist realism.

Diverging from the “naturalistic” Disney-like canons that were reigning in the 1950-60s in Soviet animated cartoons, he created his own style, which was laconic yet multi-level, non-trivial and vivid.

He is the director of outstanding animated short films including such classics as his social satire of bureaucrats, &#x27; (1966), the philosophic parable, &#x27; (1973) about the loneliness of a man in modern society, the biographical film &#x27; (1970), based on drawings and letters of young Engels, the parody &quot;Film, Film, Film&quot; (1968), and the anti-war film, &#x27; (1983).

In April 1993, Khitruk and three other leading animators (Yuri Norstein, Andrei Khrzhanovsky, and Eduard Nazarov) founded SHAR Studio, an animation school and studio in Russia. The Russian Cinema Committee is among the share-holders in the studio.

In 2008, he released a two-volume book titled &quot;The Profession of Animation&quot; (). He is the grandfather of violin virtuoso Anastasia Khitruk.

Khitruk lived in Moscow, where he died in 2012, aged 95.

<doc id="1124075" wikidata="Q1814382" url="?curid=1124075" title="Transport for Athens">
<text>Transport for Athens (), officially the Athens Urban Transport Organisation (, , ), is the operator of public transport in Athens, Greece. Transport for Athens, through its subsidiary companies, operates metro, tram, trolleybus and bus services in the Athens metropolitan area.

==Companies==
As of July 2011, the Athens Mass Transit System consists of:

* OSY S.A. ()
** Βus network (internal combustion engine buses, trolleybuses and battery electric buses).
* STASY S.A. ()
** The Athens Tram system
** The Athens Metro with 3 lines.

Transport for Athens also coordinates the Athens Suburban Railway, using Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE) lines, operated by Hellenic Train S.A. under the &quot;Proastiakos&quot; brand. The section between Piraeus, Magoula and Koropi is regarded as the urban part.

==Recent History==

In March 2011, with the Greek Government Law 3920 Attiko Metro Operational Company (AMEL S.A.) absorbed Athens-Piraeus Electric Railways S.A. and TRAM S.A. and was renamed &quot;STASY S.A.&quot; (). Also ETHEL S.A. absorbed ILPAP S.A. and was renamed as &quot;OSY S.A.&quot; (). The mergers were officially announced on June 10, 2011. While mergers at the top management level took place quickly, integration of the former companies at operations and support level proceeds slowly.

ISAP, ETHEL and ILPAP were wholly owned by OASA. AMEL and Tram S.A. until June 2011 were subsidiaries of Attiko Metro S.A. (), a company that also wholly owned by the Greek government.

Hellenic Train (formerly Trainose until May 2022) S.A., which absorbed the former Proastiakos S.A. in 2007, became independent of the OSE group in 2008 and until 2017 it is a separate private company.

OASA regularly conducts street photography and videography competitions both in black-and-white and in colour for photos taken while inside its means of transport.

== Fare collection system ==
Up until the 80s, fare collectors were commonplace in all means of mass transport in Athens. Their replacement was a money box placed at the front end of the vehicles, next to the driver, where passengers would deposit their fare in cash, usually coinage. A decade later, they were replaced with validation machines and paper tickets. The end of the single-use paper ticket came in 2017, when it was succeeded by the ATH.ENA electronic stored-value cards and tickets (stylized as ATH.ENA CARD and ATH.ENA TICKET respectively). Tickets are now rechargeable and can be loaded with up to 5-day unlimited ticket, but not with long term fare products, discount tickets (support discontinued in January 2019) or monetary value. Cards (personalised and anonymised) can hold all fare types and a maximum of €50, with the exception of discount tickets which are tied to personalised cards.

Tickets and cards are validated contaclessly in validation machines inside buses, trolleybuses and trams. Suburban railway trains and the Athens Metro utilize turnstiles.

The ATH.ENA ticket and ATH.ENA card can also be used in suburban railway trains starting from Magoula or Dhekelia and onwards.
In addition to ATH.ENA Ticket and ATH.ENA Card, OASA introduced the contactless payment system in Athens and surrounding areas, which is codenamed tap2ride.It was introduced on a pilot basis in Athens International Airport Express buses (Χ93, Χ95, Χ96, Χ97) on 24 April 2024. It was fully implemented on 15 January 2025 on all means of transport.

All contactless debit and credit cards issued in Greece and also most international cards supporting contactless payment, are accepted for travel on all means of transport (Buses, Trolleybuses, Metro, Tram and Suburban Railway). This works in the same way for the passenger as an ATH.ENA Ticket and ATH.ENA Card, including the use of Fare capping. Mobile payments - such as Apple Pay and Google Pay - are also accepted in the same way as contactless payment cards. The fares are the same as those charged on a debit or credit card, including the same daily capping. Paid rides from and to the Athens International Airport are not counted towards the daily fare cap which is 4.10€ or 4 rides per day. Each paid ride towards the daily fare cap includes 90 minutes of free transfers.

<doc id="1124078" wikidata="Q1339427" url="?curid=1124078" title="Enrico Rava">
<text>Enrico Rava (born 20 August 1939), is an Italian jazz trumpeter. He started on trombone, then changed to the trumpet after hearing Miles Davis.

==Career==
He was born in Trieste, Italy.

His first commercial work was as a member of Gato Barbieri&#x27;s Italian quintet in the mid-1960s; in the late 1960s he was a member of Steve Lacy&#x27;s group. In 1967, Rava moved to New York City and, one month later, became a member of the group Gas Mask, which had one album released on Tonsil Records in 1970.

In the 1970s and 1980s, he worked with John Abercrombie, Andrea Centazzo, Gil Evans, Richard Galliano, Joe Henderson, Joe Lovano, Pat Metheny, Michel Petrucciani, Cecil Taylor, and Miroslav Vitouš. He has also worked with Carla Bley, Lee Konitz, Jeanne Lee, Paul Motian, and Roswell Rudd. Chiefly an exponent of bebop jazz, Rava has also played in avant-garde jazz settings.

With trumpeter Paolo Fresu, Rava recorded four albums on the influence of Bix Beiderbecke, Louis Armstrong, Chet Baker, and Miles Davis. Also of note are his albums &quot;Rava&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Opera Va&#x27; &quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot;, which are his interpretations of operatic arias and overtures. In 2001, he founded a quintet with pianist Stefano Bollani and toured with Gato Barbieri and Aldo Romano. In the trio Europeans, he worked with Eberhard Weber and Swiss percussionist Reto Weber.

In June 2005, Rava was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music at the twentieth anniversary of jazz education at the Umbria Jazz Festival, in Perugia, Italy.

In 2023, Rava assembled a band of young Italian jazz musicians called The Fearless Five, consisting of Matteo Paggi on trombone, Francesco Ponticelli on double bass, drummer and singer Evita Polidoro, and guitarist Francesco Diodati, and began touring the major European jazz festivals. In July 2024, he released the album &quot;Fearless Five&quot; with this new band, featuring new versions of some of his most famous songs such as &quot;Lavori Casalinghi&quot; and &quot;The Trial&quot;.

<doc id="1124094" wikidata="Q3005167" url="?curid=1124094" title="Japanese frigate Kaiyō Maru">
<text>was one of Japan&#x27;s first modern warships, a frigate powered by both sails and steam. She was built in the Netherlands, and served in the Boshin War as part of the navy of the Tokugawa shogunate, and later as part of the navy of the Republic of Ezo. She was wrecked on 15 November 1868, off Esashi, Hokkaido, Japan.

==Construction and design==

&quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; was ordered in 1863, and built by Cornelis Gips and Sons, at Dordrecht, Netherlands, for a sum of 831,200 guilders. Her construction was overseen by a Japanese military mission under Uchida Masao and Akamatsu Noriyoshi. She was launched in October 1866, and anchored before Vlissingen on 23 October. &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; arrived in Japan in November of the same year. She was the largest wooden warship ever built by a Dutch shipyard at the time. She was long.

==Career==
In January 1868 &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; was engaged in the naval battle of Awa off Awaji Island, where she, &quot;Banryū Maru&quot; and &quot;Hazuru Maru&quot; battled against the Satsuma Navy&#x27;s &quot;Kasuga Maru&quot;, &quot;Hōō Maru&quot;, and &quot;Heiun Maru&quot;. During the battle, &quot;Hōō Maru&quot; was sunk off the coast of Awa.

In late January 1868, &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot;, &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;, &quot;Hōō Maru&quot;, and five other modern ships fled to Hokkaido, under Admiral Enomoto Takeaki. They carried a handful of French military advisors, and their leader Jules Brunet. While in Hokkaido, they became a part of the navy of the short-lived Ezo Republic, founded by Enomoto Takeaki. &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; became the flagship of the navy of the Ezo Republic, but she soon was wrecked off Esashi, Hokkaido, Japan, during a storm on 15 November 1868. The steamship &quot;Shinsoku&quot; made a rescue attempt, but it too sank.

==Salvage==
The guns and ship chandlery of &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; were discovered on the seafloor on 14 August 1968 by the submarine &quot;Yomiuri-Gō&quot; (読売号). Further remains were discovered but project financing prevented the salvage at that time however several items were recovered in 1969. Dives were conducted in August 1974 that confirmed a need for excavation of the extensive remains. Full scale excavation of the wreck from a depth of began in June 1975. The salvage of portions of the wreck located in the open sea were completed in seven years. The inland portions of the wreck were slowed by poor visibility. Costs for the salvage totaled over 3 million yen by 1985. Desalinization of the recovered artifacts began upon recovery. A replica of &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; was constructed in 1990. She is now on display at the docks in Esashi and has become a tourist attraction showing the salvaged remains of the original ship.
