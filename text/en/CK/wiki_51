<text>The Boston Associates were a loosely linked group of investors in 19th-century New England. They included Nathan Appleton, Patrick Tracy Jackson, Abbott Lawrence, and Amos Lawrence. Often related directly or through marriage, they were based in Boston, Massachusetts. The term &quot;Boston Associates&quot; was coined by historian and professor of economics and Marxism, Vera Shlakman in her 1935 work, &quot;Economic History of a Factory Town, A Study of Chicopee, Massachusetts&quot;.

== Investments ==
By 1845, 31 textile companies—located in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and southern Maine—produced one-fifth of all cotton and wool textiles in the United States. With the capital earned through these mills, they invested in railroads, especially the Boston and Lowell. These railroads helped transport the cotton from warehouses to factories. These Boston-based investors established banks—such as the Suffolk Bank—and invested in others. In time, they controlled 40% of banking capital in Boston, 40% of all insurance capital in Massachusetts, and 30% of Massachusetts&#x27; railroads. Tens of thousands of New Englanders received employment from these investors, working in any one of the hundreds of their mills.

Mill locations established or improved by the Boston Associates:
*Waltham, Massachusetts (1813)
*Lowell, Massachusetts (1822)
*Manchester, New Hampshire (1825)
*Saco, Maine (1831)
*Nashua, New Hampshire (1836)
*Dover, New Hampshire (1836)
*Chicopee, Massachusetts (1838)
*Lawrence, Massachusetts (1845)
*Holyoke, Massachusetts (1847)

==Philosophy==

Despite being &quot;shrewd, far-sighted entrepreneurs who were quick to embrace...new investment opportunities&quot;, the Boston Associates were also &quot;committed to the ideals of the original Protestant ethic and Republican simplicity&quot;. Indeed, the members established more than 30 &quot;benevolent societies and institutions&quot; between 1810 and 1840. Their investment in the Boston Manufacturing Company&#x27;s Lowell Mills project, which Henry Clay called a test for &quot;whether the manufacturing system is compatible with social virtues&quot;, epitomized their worldview.

==List of members==

Though not authoritative or necessarily complete, Robert Dalzell&#x27;s 1987 book, &quot;Enterprising elite: The Boston Associates and the world they made&quot;, enumerated the following businessmen as members of the Boston Associates social strata:
*Nathan Appleton
*William Appleton

<text>Sheraden is a neighborhood that is located in the West End of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States. Nearby neighborhoods include Windgap, Chartiers City, Crafton Heights, Esplen, and Elliott.

==History==
This neighborhood was named for William Sheraden, a settler who gave land for the construction of a railroad depot in exchange for the naming rights. Sheraden&#x27;s original homestead still stands at 2803 Bergman Street, easily distinguished by the two sycamore trees which grew together to form an arch, a legacy of Sheraden&#x27;s horticulturalist grandson.

Originally incorporated as Sheraden Borough in 1894, this town grew quickly and was annexed by the city of Pittsburgh in 1907. Shortly thereafter, the Pittsburgh school board opened multiple educational facilities around Sheraden, including Langley High School, which was completed in 1923 and replaced the former borough&#x27;s Riverview High School.

Sheraden grew to become a hub for Irish and German immigrants to Pittsburgh; however, in the 1970s when suburbia increased in popularity, the Irish and Germans moved from Sheraden into Robinson and Crafton. Most of the Irish schoolchildren went to Holy Innocents grade school, which is currently closed along with its parish. Holy Innocents also had a high school.

==Education==

Pittsburgh Public Schools operates public schools. Stevens Elementary School previously served Sheraden.

==Recreation==
McGonigle Park&lt;br&gt;
This park, located at the end of Allendale Street, features a baseball diamond, batting cage, basketball court, playground, and swing set. Behind the baseball field is a hill that connects to the Chartiers City neighborhood (with beautiful views of the Chartiers Creek).

Mutual Parklet&lt;br&gt;
This small parklet, located on Mutual Street, hosts a basketball hoop, playground, and swing set.

Sheraden Park&lt;br&gt;
Sheraden Park includes a swimming pool, tennis courts, ballfields, outdoor basketball courts and picnic and playground areas.

Sheraden Skate Park&lt;br&gt;
This park, located off of Tuxedo Street, features structures for individuals to use skateboards on.

<text>In geometry, the parabidiminished rhombicosidodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (). It is also a canonical polyhedron.

It can be constructed as a rhombicosidodecahedron with two opposing pentagonal cupolae removed. Related Johnson solids are the diminished rhombicosidodecahedron () where one cupola is removed, the metabidiminished rhombicosidodecahedron () where two non-opposing cupolae are removed, and the tridiminished rhombicosidodecahedron () where three cupolae are removed.

<doc id="1133306" wikidata="Q7398722" url="?curid=1133306" title="Saffron (singer)">
<text>Samantha Marie Sprackling (born 3 June 1968), known professionally as Saffron, is an English singer, songwriter, actress and the lead singer of the musical group Republica. She also performs solo and appeared in London&#x27;s &quot;Starlight Express&quot; onstage for two years.

==Early life and career==
Samantha Sprackling was born in Lagos, Nigeria, to an English father and Portuguese mother of part Chinese ancestry and grew up in Brixton, South London, England. When she was 18, Sprackling passed an audition for Arlene Phillips for a part in the musical &quot;Starlight Express&quot;.

She appeared in the music video for the Chesney Hawkes 1991 hit, &quot;The One and Only&quot;, and as a dancer in the music video for N-Joi&#x27;s single &quot;Mindflux&quot;. Saffron then had a brief career as a solo artist, with one of her singles – a cover of Atlantic Starr&#x27;s &quot;Circles&quot; – charting at #60 in the UK in 1993.

== Republica ==
Sprackling met Republica keyboard players Tim Dorney and Andy Todd by 1994, and they started writing songs after recruiting a guitarist and drummer. Republica released two albums and disbanded in 2001 after their record label, Deconstruction Records, collapsed.

In 2010, Republica reformed and released a re-recording of their 1996 hit &quot;Ready to Go&quot; on 7 June 2010. During early October and November 2014, Republica toured the United Kingdom in support of the Boomtown Rats &quot;Ratlife&quot; tour.

==Other work==
Sprackling worked with the Cure, appearing on the track &quot;Just Say Yes&quot;. She had previously featured on the Prodigy&#x27;s cover of L7&#x27;s &quot;Fuel My Fire&quot; (from their 1997 album, &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;); Deepsky&#x27;s &quot;Smile&quot; (from the 2002 album, &quot;In Silico&quot;); Jeff Beck&#x27;s &quot;Pork-U-Pine&quot; (from the 2003 album, &quot;Jeff&quot;) and Junkie XL&#x27;s songs, &quot;Crusher&quot;, &quot;Spirits&quot;, and &quot;Beauty Never Fades&quot; (from his 2003 album, &quot;Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin&quot;).

On 13 November 2015, Saffron performed a solo show at the 100 Club, London. She performed with guitarist Darren Beale and fellow singer Mel Sanson. She continues to tour both with Republica and with her solo show, which incorporates special guests.

In April 2016, Saffron assembled a full solo band consisting of Tony Feedback (Angelic Upstarts, Sham 69, Urban Dogs, UK Subs) on guitar, Piers Gielgud (Meat Beat Manifesto) on bass, Brad Walkhouse on saxophone/horns and Josh Collins (Reverbed) on drums. The lineup also occasionally includes Darren Beale (Boomtown Rats) on guitar. The band debuted at Polyfest 3 playing a mix of X-ray Spex classics and Republica hits.

In June 2022 Saffron took part in the Electric Ladies tour along with Toyah and Lene Lovich. A proportion of the income from the tour went towards Hazel O&#x27;Connor to help her ongoing recovery from ill health.

Saffron now works as a mental health nurse as well as continuing to perform with Republica and as a solo artist.

<doc id="1133330" wikidata="Q7154390" url="?curid=1133330" title="Paul R. Williams">
<text>Paul Revere Williams, FAIA (February 18, 1894 – January 23, 1980) was an American architect based in Los Angeles, California. Most of the buildings he designed were in Southern California and included the homes of numerous celebrities, such as Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Lon Chaney, Barbara Stanwyck, and Charles Correll. He also designed many commercial, institutional and civic buildings.

==Early life and education==
Williams came from a family of middle class Memphis residents: Chester Stanley and Lila Wright Williams. They migrated to Los Angeles in 1893 with their son, Chester, to start a fruit business, but were not successful. 

Paul was born in Los Angeles on February 18, 1894. His father died in 1896 from tuberculosis and his mother two years later from the same illness in 1898, leaving the boys in foster care. He was eventually adopted by C.I. Clarkson and his wife. Williams was the only African-American student in his elementary school. 

He studied at the Los Angeles School of Art and Design and at the Los Angeles branch of the New York Beaux-Arts Institute of Design Atelier, subsequently working as a landscape architect with Wilbur Cook, Jr. He studied architectural engineering from 1916 to 1919 at the University of Southern California, where he earned his degree, designing several residential buildings while a student there. Williams became a certified architect in California in 1921 and the first certified African-American architect west of the Mississippi.

== Personal life ==
Williams married Della Mae Givens on June 27, 1917, at the First AME Church in Los Angeles. They had three children: Paul Revere Williams Jr. (born and died June 30, 1925, buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Los Angeles); Marilyn Frances Williams (born December 25, 1926) and Norma Lucille Williams Harvey (born September 18, 1928).

==Career==
Williams won an architectural competition at age 25, and three years later opened his own office. Known as an outstanding draftsman, he perfected the skill of sketching &quot;upside down.&quot; This skill was developed because in the 1920s many of his white clients felt uncomfortable sitting directly next to a Black man. He learned to sketch upside down so that he could sit across the desk from his clients who would see his sketches right-side-up.

Struggling to gain attention, he served on the first Los Angeles City Planning Commission in 1920.

From 1921 through 1924, Williams worked for Los Angeles architect John C. Austin, eventually becoming chief draftsman, before establishing his own office.

In 1923, Williams became the first African-American member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA).

In 1939, he won the AIA Award of Merit for his design of the MCA Building in Beverly Hills (now headquarters of the Paradigm Talent Agency).

At one point in his career Williams became interested in prefabricated structures. He worked together with Wallace Neff to design experimental &quot;Airform structures&quot; which were small homes that only took a few days to construct using simple materials.

A. Quincy Jones (1913–79) was an architect who is claimed to have hired Williams and later collaborated with him on projects in Palm Springs, including the Palm Springs Tennis Club (1947) and the Town &amp; Country (1948) and Romanoff&#x27;s on the Rocks (1948) restaurants.

Lockheed and Guerdon Industries recruited Williams to design a concept for a car-alternative travel system in Las Vegas. He developed the idea of a monorail-like system called the &quot;Skylift Magi-Cab&quot; that would bring people to and from McCarran Airport and the city center.

During World War II, Williams worked for the Navy Department as an architect.

During his career Williams designed over 2,000 buildings.

==Awards, recognition and honors==

===During his lifetime===
In 1948, the anthology radio drama &quot;Destination Freedom&quot;, by Richard Durham, recapped his earlier life.

In 1951, Williams won the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, Man of the Year award and in 1953 he received the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP for his outstanding contributions as an architect and member of the African-American community.

Williams also received honorary doctorates from Lincoln University of Missouri (doctor of science, 1941), Howard University (doctor of architecture, 1952), and the Tuskegee Institute (doctor of fine arts, 1956).

In 1956, he won an award for service, from &quot;Wisdom&quot; magazine, for &quot;contributions to knowledge and distinguished service to mankind.&quot;

In 1957, he became the first Black member to be inducted into the AIA&#x27;s College of Fellows. An April 2, 1957, letter from the Executive Secretary of AIA, offered Williams the honor of Fellowship and membership in the College of Fellows &quot;for your notable contribution in Public Service.&quot;

===Posthumous honors===
USC listed him among its distinguished alumni in the television commercial for the school shown during its football games in 2004.

The American Institute of Architects (AIA) gave him its gold medal in 2017, 37 years after Williams&#x27;s death.

==Publications==
Book: &quot;The Small Home of Tomorrow&quot; (1945), with a successor volume &quot;New Homes for Today&quot; (1946).

Essay: &quot;I Am a Negro,&quot; &quot;American Magazine&quot; (1937). Reprinted in Ebony Magazine (1986) The following is a quote from that essay:I came to realize that I was being condemned, not by a lack of ability, but by my color. I passed through successive stages of bewilderment, inarticulate protest, resentment, and, finally, reconciliation to the status of my race. Eventually, however, as I grew older and thought more clearly, I found in my condition an incentive to personal accomplishment, an inspiring challenge. Without having the wish to &quot;show them,&quot; I developed a fierce desire to &quot;show myself.&quot; I wanted to vindicate every ability I had. I wanted to acquire new abilities. I wanted to prove that I, &quot;as an individual&quot;, deserved a place in the world.

==Works==

===Private homes===

Williams designed more than 2,000 private homes, most of which were in the Hollywood Hills and the Mid-Wilshire portion of Los Angeles (including his own home in Lafayette Square), part of historic West Adams, Los Angeles. He also designed at least one home in the San Rafael district along with many others in Pasadena and La Cañada Flintridge. The Linda Vista Area of Pasadena has many Spanish Colonial and French Country homes of his design including many commissioned by business magnates (Chrysler Corporation) and actors.

His most famous homes were for celebrities, and he was well regarded for his mastery of various architectural styles. Modern interpretations of Tudor-revival, French Chateau, Regency, French Country, and Mediterranean architecture were all within his vernacular. One notable home, the Jay Paley House (1935), which he designed for Jay Paley in Holmby Hills, and later the residence of Barron Hilton, was used as the &#x27;Colby mansion&#x27; in exterior scenes for &quot;The Colbys&quot; television series. Williams&#x27;s client list included Frank Sinatra (the notorious pushbutton house), Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, Lon Chaney, Sr., Lucille Ball, Julie London, Tyrone Power (two houses), Barbara Stanwyck, Bert Lahr, Charles Correll, Will Hays, Zasu Pitts, and Danny Thomas.

In contrast to these splendid mansions, Williams co-designed with Hilyard Robinson the first federally funded public housing projects of the post-war period (Langston Terrace in Washington, D.C.) and later the Pueblo del Rio project in southeast Los Angeles.

Williams famously remarked upon the bitter irony of the fact that most of the homes he designed, and whose construction he oversaw, were on parcels whose deeds included segregation covenants barring Black people from purchasing them.

A number of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

He also designed the Al Jolson tomb in Hillside Memorial Park, to where Jolson&#x27;s body was moved in 1951. The tomb and fountain are prominently visible from the adjacent San Diego Freeway. It is perhaps a fitting tribute to both Williams and Jolson that he was chosen to design Jolson&#x27;s resting place since Jolson had a long history of supporting African-American entertainers, in a time when that was controversial.

===Professional records===

In 1955, Williams was hired to transform a W.W.Woolworth store at the corner of Broadway and 45th in Los Angeles into the Broadway Federal Savings and Loan. When the bank opened, Williams safeguarded much of his business papers in the bank. During the fires that consumed the area after the Rodney King trial in 1992, the Broadway Bank burned and it was feared that much of Williams&#x27; archives had been lost. Williams family had carefully curated the documents and Williams&#x27; granddaughter, Karen Elyse Hudson, agreed to the acquisition of the archive by the Getty Research Institute and the USC School of Architecture. In June 2020, Milton S. F. Curry of USC announced the contents of the archive: about 35,000 architectural plans, 10,000 original drawings, blueprints, photographs, and correspondence that help &quot;fill the gaps of Los Angeles Modernism in the 20th century.&quot;

==Death==

Williams retired his practice in 1973, and died from diabetes on January 23, 1980, at age 85. His funeral was held at the First AME Church he designed, and the presiding minister, Cecil Murray, was joined in the pulpit by Dr. William H.D. Hornaday, the Senior Minister of Founder&#x27;s Church of Religious Science, that Williams also had designed. Dr. Hornaday described Williams as a gentle and courtly man of the highest integrity. Williams was interred in the Sanctuary of Radiance, Manchester Garden Mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood. Williams&#x27;s widow Della Williams (1895–1996) co-founded (with Fannie Williams) &#x27;The Wilfandel Club&#x27; Established November 21, 1945, by black women active in the Los Angeles, California, community. The Wilfandel Club&#x27;s goal has been to promote civic betterment, philanthropic endeavors, and general culture. The Wilfandel Club is the oldest African-American women&#x27;s club in Los Angeles. Club meetings are still held at the beautiful Wilfandel Club House on 3425 West Adams Blvd in Los Angeles. Della Williams survived her famous husband by 16 years, living to the age of 100; she died on July 24, 1996. Her funeral was held at Founder&#x27;s Church of Religious Science, designed by her husband. She was interred in the Williams crypt Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood.

On October 29, 2015, a monument and memorial plaza to Paul Williams was dedicated just to the north of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building as part of its recent renovation. The monument, made by artist Georgia Toliver features a 9-foot-tall bas relief of Paul Williams with many of his significant works. The bas relief is flanked with interpretive panels with a biography of Mr. Williams as well as a history of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company.

==Quotes==
&quot;If I allow the fact that I am a Negro to checkmate my will to do, now, I will inevitably form the habit of being defeated.&quot;

&quot;Planning is thinking beforehand how something is to be made or done, and mixing imagination with the product – which in a broad sense makes all of us planners. The only difference is that some people get a license to get paid for thinking and the rest of us just contribute our good thoughts to our fellow man.&quot;

&quot;Without having the wish to &#x27;show them,&#x27; I developed a fierce desire to &#x27;show myself,&#x27;&quot; Williams wrote in his 1937 essay entitled &quot;I am a Negro&quot; for &quot;The American Magazine&quot;. &quot;I wanted to vindicate every ability I had. I wanted to acquire new abilities. I wanted to prove that I, &quot;as an individual&quot;, deserved a place in the world.&quot;

&quot;Expensive homes are my business and social housing is my hobby.&quot;

&quot;Being a Californian was to my advantage. In California the people are interested in ideas that are new and fresh without the traditional or historical ties that are ordinarily more associated with East Coast thinking.&quot;

<text>Uzeyir bey Abdulhuseyn bey oghlu Hajibeyov (18 September 188523 November 1948) was an Azerbaijani composer, musicologist and teacher. He is recognized as the father of Azerbaijani classical music. He composed the music of the national anthem of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (which was re-adopted after Azerbaijan regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991). Hajibeyov also composed the anthem used by Azerbaijan during the Soviet period. He was the first composer of an opera in the Islamic world. He composed the first oriental opera &quot;Leyli and Majnun&quot; in 1908 and since then he is revered for adapting the written masterpiece to the theatre.

==Early life==

Uzeyir Hajibeyov was born in Aghjabadi, near Shusha of Azerbaijan, on 18 September 1885. His father, Abdulhuseyn bey Hajibeyli, was the secretary to Khurshidbanu Natavan for many years, and his mother, Shirin, grew up in the Natavan household. Growing up, Hajibeyov was strongly influenced by Natavan&#x27;s work.

Shusha, often dubbed as the cradle of Azerbaijani music and culture, had a reputation for its musical heritage. The town was also referred to as &quot;the Music Conservatory of the Caucasus&quot; because of its many talented musicians and singers. And the fact that Hajibeyov grew up in Shusha explains how at 22, in 1908, with very little formal musical education, he was capable of writing a full-length opera.
Hajibeyov received his early education in a religious school (madrasah), where he perfected his Arabic and Persian. Later he studied at a two-year Russian-Azerbaijani school. Here, with the help of his favorite teacher Mirza Mehdi Hasanzadeh, he familiarized himself with the heritage of the famous classic writers of the East and the West. The richness of the musical performance tradition of Shusha greatly influenced the musical education of Hajibeyov. He would later reflect on his experiences: &quot;The first musical education I got as a child in Shusha came from the best singers and saz-players. At that time I sang mughams and tasnifs. The singers liked my voice. They would make me sing and teach me at the same time.&quot; Uzeyir Hajibeyov&#x27;s first teacher was his uncle Aghalar Aliverdibeyov, an excellent connoisseur of Azeri folk music. In 1897–1898, when Azerbaijani playwright Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev and singer Jabbar Garyaghdioglu staged the episode &quot;Majnun on Leyli&#x27;s grave&quot; from &quot;Leyli and Majnun&quot;, 13-year-old Uzeyir sang in the choir. 
From 1899 to 1904 Uzeyir Hajibeyov studied at the Gori Pedagogical Seminary, later to be known as the Transcaucasian Teachers Seminary. There, along with general education, he also acquired music. In this school, Hajibeyov learned to play the violin, the violoncello and the brass instrument. After his graduation from the Pedagogical Seminary, Uzeyir Hajibeyov was appointed a teacher to the village of Hadrut in Upper Karabakh. Having worked there for a year, Hajibeyov permanently settled in Baku, where he carried on his career in teaching mathematics, geography, history, Azerbaijani and Russian languages, and music. He wrote the &quot;Turkic-Russian and Russian-Turkic Dictionary of Political, Legal, Economic and Military Terms, Used in Press&quot; in 1907 and the textbook &quot;Arithmetic Problems&quot; in 1908, and had them published by the Orujov Brothers Publishing House in Baku.

Hajibeyov was no stranger to the tragic chaos of war; he lived through the Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, the fall of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan in 1920, and both World Wars. The political repercussions of these military conquests often manifested in other forms of chaos. For example, between 1920 and 1940, the alphabet systems for writing Azerbaijani were changed three times — from Arabic to Latin, and from Latin to Cyrillic — a process which greatly hindered and interrupted the educational and cultural process, and may well have been one of the factors influencing Uzeyir Hajibeyov to present his ideas verbally on the musical stage.

==Merging traditional and Western styles==
Throughout all the tumultuous change in Azerbaijan that took place between 1900 and 1940, one characteristic consistently reflects the character of Uzeyir Hajibeyov. He always searched for ways to merge and integrate the past with the present, rather than to discard either form. Rather curiously, even files at the Gori Pedagogical Seminary have shown his persistence in holding on to his own roots even under pressure. On 3 December 1900, when he was 15, it is noted that &quot;the student, Uzeyir Hajibeyov, was rebuked because he was talking in his native language.&quot; Conversely, when Russian-influenced musicians tried to ban traditional Azerbaijani instruments like the tar, zurna and kamancha, Hajibeyov and his colleagues pushed to incorporate them into the Western orchestra, thereby, giving them an even higher status and ultimately a chance to survive. Hajibeyov had the opportunity to open music schools that combined various educational systems. In these schools, national cadres who could integrate into the world music culture were trained. The history and music theory of Azerbaijani music were researched, and education classes were written. Uzeyir Hajibeyov in the field of music education combined and created in Azerbaijan Western and East traditions.

==Music==
In 1908, Hajibeyov wrote his first opera, &quot;Leyli and Majnun&quot;, based on the tragic love story by the 15th century poet Fuzûlî. This would be the first of 7 operas and 3 musical comedies that Hajibeyov would compose throughout his life. In &quot;Leyli and Majnun&quot;, the uniqueness of the traditional modal music of mugham was incorporated into a Western genre with the use of instruments indigenous to both traditions.

Hajibeyov&#x27;s second opera &quot;Sheikh Sanan&quot; was written in 1909 in a form that was entirely opposite to the first. This time Hajibeyov employed a purely European style. &quot;Sheikh Sanan&quot; received raves as a musical composition, but the content was too progressive for the period. In this opera, Hajibeyov advocated that marriage should not be bound by nationality or religion - in essence, it was another form of integration. But this time, it backfired. The story line follows a religious sheikh on his way to Mecca who meets a very beautiful Georgian lady. To his horror, the lovely creature&#x27;s father turns out to be a swineherd, caring for what, to him, was a forbidden animal. In the end, the sheikh denounces his religion to win the woman. It is said that when the opera was performed, many people were offended and walked out, leaving Hajibeyov with the realization that he had outpaced his generation too much this time. As a result, he made a drastic decision and burned the score. When asked by Ramazan Khalilov, his assistant, how he could do that, Hajibeyov replied: &quot;I didn&#x27;t destroy my opera. It&#x27;s my own creation, so it&#x27;s always in my head.&quot; Khalilov said that Hajibeyov went on to use this same magnificent music 27 years later to create &quot;Koroghlu&quot;, an opera that many acclaim to be his finest.

In contrast to &quot;Sheikh Sanan&quot;, Hajibeyov&#x27;s operas &quot;Rustam and Sohrab&quot; (1910), &quot;Asli and Karam&quot; (1912), &quot;Shah Abbas and Khurshid Banu&quot; (1912), and &quot;Harun and Leyli&quot; (1915) were entirely based on Azerbaijani folk music elements, primarily mugham.

In October 2006, the musical comedy &quot;Arshin Mal Alan&quot; (&quot;The Cloth Peddler&quot;) by Uzeyir Hajibeyov, written in 1914, was announced to be performed on western stages for the first time.
One of Hajibeyov&#x27;s greatest legacies was bringing forward the idea of establishing a professional music school. Hence, the Baku Academy of Music (known then as the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire), was founded in 1920 and named after Hajibeyov after his death. The school has trained Azerbaijan&#x27;s finest composers such as Gara Garayev, Fikrat Amirov, Jovdat Hajiyev, Soltan Hajibeyov, Tofig Guliyev, and Vagif Mustafazade. His statue sits in front of this grand building that is still devoted to the synthesizing Eastern and Western musical traditions.

In 1931, Hajibeyov helped in establishing the Azeri Folk Instruments Orchestra affiliated with the Radio Committee. This orchestra performed European classical pieces, such as those by Mikhail Glinka, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Schubert, Georges Bizet and others. Hajibeyov thus was the first musician to adapt the note system to traditional Azerbaijani musical instruments.

In 1936, Hajibeyov assisted in the founding of the Azerbaijani State Choir within the Azerbaijan Philharmonic Society. One of the most serious problems he faced was the mono-voiced repertoire of Azerbaijani folk songs, which allowed harmonization to distort style of the song and, on occasion, even alter the melody line when it changed modes. Hajibeyov resolved this problem by using contrapuntal polyphony and unison-doubling rather than four-part singing in the problematic sections.

Hajibeyov devoted much energy to the idea of integrating woman&#x27;s role and status into the male-dominated world. The concept of women&#x27;s emancipation runs through many of his works, often in the form of comedy or satirization, as in the case when he makes fun of the process of selecting marriage partners, a process hindered by the fact that women were still wearing veils until the 1920s when the Soviet regime prohibited them.

=== Operas ===

==== “Leyli and Majnun” ====

The opera art was established art not only in Azerbaijan, but also in the entire Muslim East by means of Hacibeyov&#x27;s opera &quot;Leyli and Majnun&quot; which premiered on 12 January 1908, at the theatre of Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev. Hajibeyov wrote with his brother Jeyhun Hajibeyli this libretto of the opera based on a poem of the same name written by Fuzuli. The first performance was made by actor and director Huseyn Arablinski. The band-master was the writer-dramatist Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev. Huseynqulu Sarabski was in the role of “Majnun” and Abdurrahim Farajov in the role of “Leyli”.In next performances, Hajibeyov himself and his close friend and colleague, composer Muslim Magomayev, performed as band-master.

This role was acted for the first time by Huseyinqulu Sarablinski. Then, these people - Sidghi Ruhulla, Khanlar Hakhverdiev, Aliovsat Sadigov, Shirzad Huseynov, Gulagha Mammadov, Mais Salmanov, Gulu Asgerov, Bakir Hashimov, Ali Mehdiyev, Arif Babayev, Baba Mirzaev, Janali Akbarov, Safa Gahramanov, Alim Gasimov and Mansum Ibrahimov performed in a role of Majnun at the next performance.

In this opera, Hajibeyov created arias, mass choral scenes, various ensembles, ballet numbers and recitatives.

In the next years of his life, he worked on &quot;Firuza&quot; opera.

=== Musical comedies ===

==== “Husband and wife” ====
The first musical comedy of Hajibeyov is “Husband and wife” which consists of three scenes. This is the first example of Azerbaijani musical comedy. The first premiere of it was in 1910. H.Sarabski and A.Aghdamski performed in the roles of Marjan and Minnat. Hajibeyov wrote the sketch of the comedy himself.

==== “If Not That One, Then This One” ====
After “Husband and wife” opera, he began to write the second operetta of him. The first premiere of it was at the theatre of Mailovs brothers in Baku in 1911. “Mən nə qədər qoca olsam da” song and “Uzundere” national folk music are sounded in this opera with some changes on it.

Later, this opera was translated into various languages, performed in Caucasian countries, Turkey, Bulgaria and other countries.

==== &quot;Arshin Mal Alan&quot; ====
The first feature film based on “Arshin Mal Alan” Musical comedy was shot in 1916. This film was the silent film.

For the next time it was screened at &quot;Baku movie studio&quot; in 1945 with some changes on it. The main role of the film belonged to Rashid Behbudov.

This comedy again was screened in Baku, in 1965. The director of the film was Tofiq Taghizade and Fikrat Amirov performed as a music redactor. It was translated into many languages such as English, German, Chinese, Arabic, Persian, Polish etc.

==Publications==

From 1919 to 1920 Hajibeyov served as editor-in-chief for the newspaper &quot;Azerbaijan&quot;, the main governmental media body of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan.

In 1927, Hajibeyov published &quot;Collection of Azerbaijani Folk Songs&quot; along with composer Muslim Magomayev. For the first time, more than 300 pieces of Azeri folk music were documented by notation. In 1945, he published the book entitled &quot;Principles of Azerbaijan Folk Music&quot;, which has been translated into several languages including English in 1985 devoted to the centenary of his birth.

==Legacy==
In 2013, Google celebrated Hajibeyov&#x27;s 128th Birthday with Google Doodle on its Azerbaijani version.

===Official honours===

Hajibeyov was the creator of the first operas and operettas in the Orient. In 1938, he was awarded with the title of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR. He was also honored with the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize which he won twice, once in 1941 for the opera &quot;Koroghlu&quot; (1936), and the other time in 1946 for the 1945 film based on his opera &quot;Arshin Mal Alan&quot;.

Hajibeyov was a professor at the Baku Academy of Music (of which he was also head in 1928–1929 and 1939–1948) and Active Member of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan. For the last 10 years of his life, he was Chairman of the Composers Union of Azerbaijan.

Hajibeyov died of diabetes at the age of 63, and was buried at the Alley of Honor in Baku.

On 18 September 1995, the 110th anniversary of Hajibeyov&#x27;s birth has been celebrated. No one in the history of modern music in Azerbaijan is recognized for having done more to lay the foundation for Azerbaijani music as it exists today, especially with its unique synthesis of Eastern and Western traditional musical instruments and musical forms.

In 2008, the National Bank of Azerbaijan minted a 100 manat gold commemorative coin dedicated to Hajibeyov&#x27;s memory.

In June 2011 President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and President of Serbia Tadic unveiled a monument of Hajibeyov on the Dunavski kej in Novi Sad, Serbia.

On the occasion of the 130th birthday anniversary of the composer, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti proclaimed 18 September 2015 as the &quot;Uzeyir Hajibeyli Memorial Day&quot; in the City of Los Angeles and called on all residents to join this celebration. Also U.S. Congressman Paul Gosar from Arizona extended a Congressional Record recognizing Hajibeyov&#x27;s achievements.

=== Uzeyir Music Day ===
18 September is celebrated as &quot;Uzeyir Music Day&quot; after national leader Heydar Aliyev&#x27;s decree in 1995. Different events and celebrations are usually held on this day with participation of world-famous musicians.

<doc id="1133333" wikidata="Q5418625" url="?curid=1133333" title="Evolution Worlds">
<text>Evolution Worlds (known as in Japan) is a role-playing video game developed by Sting Entertainment for the GameCube. It was first published in Japan in 2002 by Entertainment Software Publishing and later by Ubisoft in North America and Europe. The game contains an abbreviated version of &quot;&quot; (1999) along with the full sequel &quot;Evolution 2: Far Off Promise&quot; (1999) on the same disc. Both games were originally released on the Sega Dreamcast.

== Plot ==
The game is set in the year of 930. An ancient civilization had met its demise one thousand years before. Special individuals are able to use Cyframes, ancient tools, which were excavated from the ruins of the ancient civilization. These individuals are known as Cyframe users or adventurers, and are assigned jobs from the Society, a research institute. The adventurers use their Cyframes to explore ruins. Some of the ruins have hieroglyphics that tell of a Cyframe called Evolutia that has tremendous power. Many search for the fabled Evolutia like the Launcher family and even the army.

== Major characters ==
*Mag Launcher: The only offspring of the renowned Launcher family, Mag lives in his parents&#x27; mansion west of Pannam Town. His dream is to become as famed and successful an adventurer as his father, Asroc, who was lost while adventuring and never returned. Now, Mag is the only one to lead the family; despite his talent and enthusiasm, the Launcher family has since spiraled into debt.
*Linear Cannon: She is always following Mag around on his adventures. Three years before the events of &quot;Evolution Worlds&quot;, she appeared at the Launcher home with a letter from Mag&#x27;s father, which requested that Mag protect her. When she first arrived Linear was afraid of everything around her, when Mag gave her an Ocarina she slowly started to feel safer. Linear is habitually shy and silent, only occasionally daring to voice her thoughts, but she wields mysterious healing powers. It is later learned that she is Evolutia, the god of evolution. After defeating Eugene, and revealing her true form, she begins to speak, addressing Mag only, and in combat, or when examining objects. Her sentences are still short.
*Gre Nade: He is the Launcher family&#x27;s butler. He watches over Mag and Linear with a stern eye, charged by Asroc Launcher with their safety. Gre is often strict, but skilled in all respects befitting a butler: he is good with money, a master chef, and in times of battle, an excellent shot with a rifle. Gre takes away no money when chosen for a dungeon.
*Pepper Box: She is a wild adult adventurer with a bazooka-like Cyframe attached to her hip. Pepper is a beautiful and flirtatious young blonde woman who seems to have much experience as an adventurer. Her Cyframe, once sufficiently upgraded, can become extremely powerful. Pepper takes almost half of the prize money when completing a dungeon with her. She wears a stylish blue ensemble.
*Chain Gun: A young girl whose family has always been rivals with the Launchers. Chain is brash and a little conceited, but she is always willing to help Mag on a trip into the ruins (in no small part because of her secret infatuation with him). The Guns had wanted a male heir to carry on their legacy, and when Chain was born, her parents raised her as something of a tomboy. Chain takes a small portion of the prize money when completing a dungeon with her.
*Carcano: A mysterious but honorable bandit who raids the train Mag and friends are on to Museville. Mag later finds his hideout at Pine Village and defeats him. Near the end of the adventure, impressed with the young Launcher&#x27;s strength and devotion, he joins Mag to defeat Yurka. Carcano can steal items from enemies, and he wields a devastating and versatile Cyframe that is fashioned after a drill.
*Eugene: Refined and intelligent, Eugene holds unsurpassed military clout as the head of the 8th Imperial Army. He stations his troops in Pannam Town while searching for Evolutia, in hopes of harnessing its power as a source of unlimited energy. Disturbingly enamored with Linear, he eventually captures her, forcing Mag to confront and defeat him.
*Yurka: The evolution of Destruction, he may also be Linear&#x27;s brother. After visiting her a few times at hotel he convinces Linear to leave Mag under the presumption that if she stays with Mag he will be in danger. He later combines Linear&#x27;s power and his own to power a machine called Ulticannon. Linear is brought out of a trance that Yurka put her in by Mag when he plays the Ocarina he gave her. When Linear leaves his jealousy and anger transforms the Ulticannon to a much darker form but is defeated by Mag and his friends.

== Re-release ==
&quot;Evolution Worlds&quot; has several changes in its re-release of &quot;Evolution&quot; and &quot;Evolution 2&quot;. The first &quot;Evolution&quot; has no spoken dialogue, and the sequel has a Japanese voice track. &quot;Evolution Worlds&quot; uses newly recorded English voice acting for both games.

The Linear Watch was removed, due to lack of Dreamcast&#x27;s portable memory cartridge, Visual Memory Unit. Due to limited disc space, the first part (re-release of Evolution) is highly trimmed down, eliminating almost all of its dungeon crawling and condensing the game&#x27;s entire plot into fewer, but much longer, cutscenes.

== Reception ==
The game received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

<doc id="1133351" wikidata="Q952214" url="?curid=1133351" title="VSS Enterprise">
<text>VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (tail number: N339SS) was the first SpaceShipTwo (SS2) spaceplane, built by Scaled Composites for Virgin Galactic. As of 2004, it was planned to be the first of five commercial suborbital SS2 spacecraft planned by Virgin Galactic.
It was also the first ship of the Scaled Composites Model 339 SpaceShipTwo class, based on upscaling the design of record-breaking SpaceShipOne.

The VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s name was an acknowledgement of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. The spaceplane also shared its name with NASA&#x27;s prototype Space Shuttle orbiter, as well as the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.
It was rolled out on 7 December 2009.

SpaceShipTwo made its first powered flight in April 2013. Richard Branson said it &quot;couldn&#x27;t have gone more smoothly&quot;.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was destroyed during a powered test flight on 31 October 2014, killing one pilot, Michael Alsbury, and seriously injuring another, Peter Siebold. This was the first spacecraft-related accident in which part, but not all, of the crew survived. An investigation revealed the accident was caused by premature deployment of the &quot;feathering&quot; system, the ship&#x27;s descent device; the NTSB also faulted the spacecraft&#x27;s design for lacking fail-safe mechanisms that could have deterred or prevented early deployment.

==Flight test program==

Initial projections by Virgin Galactic in 2008 called for test flights to begin in late 2009 and commercial service to start in 2011. This schedule was not achieved, with captive carry and glide flight tests beginning in 2010, and the first test flight under rocket power in 2013.

In October 2009, Virgin Galactic CEO Will Whitehorn outlined the flight test program for SpaceShipTwo. The test program includes seven phases:
# Vehicle ground testing
# Captive carry under White Knight Two
# Unpowered glide testing
# Subsonic testing with only a brief firing of the rocket
# Supersonic atmospheric testing
# Full flight into suborbital space
# Execute a detailed and lengthy appraisal process with the FAA/AST to demonstrate the system&#x27;s robustness and eventually obtain a commercial launch license to begin commercial operations.

On 22 March 2010, the SpaceShipTwo vehicle VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; underwent a captive carry test flight, with the parent White Knight Two aircraft, VMS &quot;Eve&quot;, performing a short flight while carrying the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.
A second test flight was made on 16 May 2010, reaching SS2&#x27;s launch altitude (51,000 feet) and lasting nearly five hours, in order to facilitate &quot;cold soak&quot; testing of SS2&#x27;s avionics and pressurization system. Thereafter, &quot;a simulated spaceship descent/glide mission was made from [launch] altitude.&quot;
Between these two flights, the SpaceShipTwo airframe was modified by the addition of two interior fins, with one fin being added to the inside (rocket-side) of each of the craft&#x27;s twin vertical stabilizers.

On 15 July 2010, VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; made its first crewed flight. The craft remained attached to VMS &quot;Eve&quot; as planned, and underwent a series of combined vehicle systems tests. The flight lasted a total of 6 hours and 21 minutes. A second, similar crewed flight of VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and VMS &quot;Eve&quot; was carried out on 30 September 2010, lasting approximately 5 hours. Among the objectives of these flights was the improvement of pilot proficiency, and the results of the flights were deemed to show that the systems were capable of supporting future glide missions.

On 10 October 2010, VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; made its first crewed gliding test flight. It was released from VMS &quot;Eve&quot; at 45,000 ft (13,700 metres) and glided to a safe landing at the Mojave Air and Spaceport. A second gliding test flight took place on 28 October 2010 and a third on 17 November 2010. , Scaled reported that the flight test program was exceeding expectations. The fourth test flight took place on 13 January 2011, while the fifth and sixth glide flights occurred on 22 and 27 April 2011, respectively. Following this, the feathered reentry configuration was tested in flight on 4 May 2011, with weekly test flights continuing through the end of May.
On 9 June 2011, SS2 failed to separate from White Knight Two during its 11th planned glide flight due to a technical problem. Testing resumed with five successful glide flights in June 2011.

In July 2011, after 15 successful glide flights, flight testing of SS2 was halted for two months while planned revisions to the spaceplane were made. Flight tests resumed in late September 2011, although the 16th glide flight – on 29 September – was marred by a brief loss of control aboard SS2, forcing the crew to utilise the feathered wing configuration to land safely. This test was followed by another hiatus, during which some of the spacecraft&#x27;s engine components were installed. In June 2012, Scaled Composites received an FAA permit to conduct rocket-powered supersonic test flights. SpaceShipTwo flight tests resumed in June 2012.

In September 2012, Virgin Galactic announced that the unpowered glide flight test program was essentially complete. The company thereafter stated its intention to fit the hybrid rocket motor and control system to the vehicle, before resuming the glide flight test program with the rocket motor installed, in order to recharacterize the spacecraft&#x27;s glide performance with slightly different weight distribution and aerodynamics. In October 2012, Scaled Composites installed key components of the rocket motor, and SpaceShipTwo performed its first glide flight with the engine installed in December 2012.

The spacecraft&#x27;s first powered test flight took place on 29 April 2013, briefly driving SpaceShipTwo to a supersonic velocity. Richard Branson said it &quot;couldn&#x27;t have gone more smoothly&quot;.

On 5 September 2013, the second powered flight was made by the SpaceShipTwo. It broke the sound barrier, reached Mach 1.43, and climbed to 69,000 feet (21 km) over the Mojave Desert under rocket power and descended using its tilt-wing &quot;feathering&quot; maneuver. Space journalist Doug Messier reported that &quot;the engine plume featured white smoke, not the black smoke seen on the April flight.&quot;

On 10 January 2014, the third powered flight climbed higher than the previous flights, testing a new coating on the tail boom and other systems.

===First commercial spacecraft accident===
On 31 October 2014, &quot;Enterprise&quot; broke apart in flight during a powered test flight over California&#x27;s Mojave Desert. The flight began smoothly, with &quot;Enterprise&quot; being dropped from its WhiteKnightTwo carrier and igniting its engine at an altitude of . About 60 to 90 seconds into the flight, an &quot;anomaly&quot; was reported that resulted in destruction of the ship. The pilot in command, Peter Siebold, escaped from the craft and parachuted to safety; the copilot, Michael Alsbury, was killed in the crash.

The National Transportation Safety Board conducted an independent investigation into the accident. In July 2015, the NTSB released a report that cited inadequate design safeguards, poor pilot training, lack of rigorous federal oversight and a potentially anxious co-pilot without recent flight experience as important factors in the crash. The NTSB determined that the crash resulted from the co-pilot&#x27;s premature deployment of the feathering mechanism, which is normally used to aid a safe descent. The NTSB also faulted the ship&#x27;s designers for failing to protect against human error, noting that the spacecraft lacked fail-safe systems that would have prevented or deterred a premature deployment of the feathering mechanism. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish human factors guidance specific to commercial spaceflight operators and create a more rigorous application process for experimental spaceflight permits.

<doc id="1133352" wikidata="Q914583" url="?curid=1133352" title="Crocodiles (album)">
<text>Crocodiles is the debut album by the English post-punk band Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. It was released on 18 July 1980 in the United Kingdom and on 17 December 1980 in the United States. The album reached number 17 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Pictures on My Wall&quot; and &quot;Rescue&quot; had previously been released as singles.

Recorded at Eden Studios in London and at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth, &quot;Crocodiles&quot; was produced by Bill Drummond and David Balfe, while Ian Broudie had already produced the single &quot;Rescue&quot;. The album received favourable reviews from the music press, receiving four out of five stars by both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot; magazines.

==Background and recording==
Echo &amp; the Bunnymen formed in 1978 and originally consisted of Ian McCulloch (vocals and rhythm guitar), Will Sergeant (lead guitar), Les Pattinson (bass) and a drum machine. They released their debut single, &quot;The Pictures on My Wall&quot;, in May 1979 on the independent label Zoo Records. The band then signed with WEA subsidiary label Korova and were persuaded to employ a drummer. Pete de Freitas subsequently joined the band, and in early 1980 they recorded their second single, &quot;Rescue&quot;. The single was recorded at Eden Studios in London and produced by fellow Liverpudlian and ex-member of Big in Japan Ian Broudie.

A British tour followed in June 1980 before the band went to Rockfield Studios to record their debut album. Despite talk of the American singer Del Shannon being asked to produce the album, it was produced by the band&#x27;s manager Bill Drummond and his business partner and The Teardrop Explodes keyboard player David Balfe. The recording of the album only took three weeks, but Pattinson was surprised by the boring nature of the recording process: &quot;There was a lot of hanging about. I didn&#x27;t get all the &#x27;drop-ins&#x27; and &#x27;edits&#x27; bit.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
The music on &quot;Crocodiles&quot; is generally dark and moody: In 1980, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; described McCulloch&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;scattered with themes of sorrow, horror, and despair, themes that are reinforced by stormy animal/sexual imagery&quot; and American music magazine &quot;Creem&quot; described &quot;Crocodiles&quot; as &quot;a moody, mysterious, fascinating record.&quot; In 1981, music journalist David Fricke, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, said, &quot;Instead of dope, McCulloch trips out on his worst fears: isolation, death and emotional bankruptcy.&quot;

In his 2005 book &quot;Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978–1984&quot;, British music journalist Simon Reynolds describes the sound of the album as &quot;pared and sparse.&quot; He goes on to describe Pattinson&#x27;s &quot;granite basslines&quot; carrying the melody; Sergeant&#x27;s guitar playing as &quot;jagged-quartz&quot; and avoiding &quot;anything resembling a solo, apart from the odd flinty peal of lead playing&quot;; de Freitas&#x27; drumming as minimal and &quot;surging urgency&quot;; and McCulloch&#x27;s vocals as having &quot;precocious authority.&quot; Reynolds describes the songs as being rooted in &quot;doubt, anguish, despair&quot; while the &quot;tightness and brightness of their sound transmits contradictory sensations of confidence, vigour and euphoria.&quot; He also describes how the line &quot;Stars are stars and they shine so hard&quot; from the track &quot;Stars Are Stars&quot; showed how the band felt no embarrassment in their wish to be famous. In 1989 McCulloch told Reynolds how, as a teenager, he felt there was &quot;a big movie camera in the sky.&quot; McCulloch described the opening line of the track &quot;Going Up&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t thou watching my film&quot; as a terrible line, and he went on to say &quot;It was meant to be tongue in cheek, but that was what spurred me on.&quot;

==Cover==
The cover photograph is one of a series taken by photographer Brian Griffin in the woods near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire at night. The photos show themes of introspection, despair and confusion. Describing the cover photo, music journalist Chris Salewicz said, &quot;[...] the Bunnymen are placed in poses of histrionic despair in a near-neurotically gothic woodland that evokes memories of elfin glades and fabled Arthurian legends.&quot; &quot;Creem&quot; magazine said, &quot;The cover art suggests four boys dazed and confused in a drugged dream, a surreal where-are-we landscape. The Bunnymen&#x27;s images are of loneliness, disconnection, a world gone awry.&quot;

Originally the band wanted the pictures to include burning stakes, but given the possible KKK connotations, they settled for moody lighting instead. However, McCulloch was pleased with the cover, saying &quot;the cover [...] is better to look at than the Mona Lisa.&quot; Sergeant was less happy, saying that he &quot;was pissed off that there was a solo picture of [McCulloch] on the back cover.&quot;

In the book &quot;The KLF: Chaos, Magic and the Band Who Burned a Million Pounds&quot; by John Higgs, Bill Drummond says that he saw the face of &quot;Echo&quot;, an imagined giant rabbit, in the cover design.

==Releases==
The album was originally released as an LP in the United Kingdom on 18 July 1980 by Warner Bros. subsidiary label Korova. Two tracks, &quot;Do It Clean&quot; and &quot;Read It in Books&quot;, were included on the cassette but were initially omitted from the LP version of the album because the managing director of Warner Bros., Rob Dickins, mistakenly thought that they contained obscenities. After Dickins realised his error, the tracks were included on the American version of the album, which was released by Sire Records on 17 December 1980. The two tracks were included with the UK release as a limited-edition single. The album was first released on CD in May 1989 by WEA in the UK. It was released on CD in the US by Sire Records the following year. The track listings found on these versions were the same as those of the original LP releases for each country.

Along with Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s first five albums, &quot;Crocodiles&quot; was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003, marketed as a 25th-anniversary edition ten bonus tracks on the UK version and eight on the American version. The UK version contained the missing tracks &quot;Do It Clean&quot; and &quot;Read It in Books&quot;. The other bonus tracks included &quot;Simple Stuff&quot;, which was the B-side to the single &quot;Rescue&quot;; early versions of &quot;Villiers Terrace&quot;, &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Simple Stuff&quot; from the album&#x27;s recording sessions; and the four tracks from the &quot;Shine So Hard&quot; EP, &quot;Crocodiles&quot;, &quot;Zimbo&quot;, &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and &quot;Over the Wall&quot;. The reissued album was produced by music historian Andy Zax and producer Bill Inglot.

Two singles were released before the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Pictures on My Wall&quot; (as &quot;The Pictures on My Wall&quot;), the band&#x27;s first single, was released on 5 May 1979. The single version was recorded before de Freitas had joined the band, but the song was re-recorded for the album with de Freitas on drums. The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Rescue&quot;, released on 5 May 1980, became the band&#x27;s first song to chart when it reached number 62 on the UK Singles Chart.

Scottish band Idlewild covered the track &quot;Rescue&quot; on their single &quot;These Wooden Ideas&quot; in June 2000. In late 2001, American singer-songwriter Kelley Stoltz released the album &quot;Crockodials&quot;, a track-by-track cover version of the original &quot;Crocodiles&quot; album.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;NME&quot; in 1980, Chris Salewicz described the album as &quot;being probably the best album this year by a British band.&quot; In his review of the album for &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Ian Cranna said that the album was &quot;proof positive that there&#x27;s just no substitute for a good song delivered with power and emotion.&quot; Cranna added, &quot;[The band] deliver attractive melodies with dark and moody (but not obscure) personal lyrics, all turned into compulsive listening by a driving beat, ringing guitars and a hauntingly emotional voice.&quot; Reviewing the album in 1981 for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, David Fricke awarded it four out of five stars and described McCulloch&#x27;s vocals: &quot;[He] specializes in a sort of apocalyptic brooding, combining Jim Morrison-style psychosexual yells, a flair for David Bowie-like vocal inflections and the nihilistic bark of his punk peers into a disturbing portrait of the singer as a young neurotic.&quot; Fricke went on to say, &quot;Behind him, gripping music swells into Doors-style dirges (&#x27;Pictures on My Wall&#x27;), PiL-like guitar dynamics (&#x27;Monkeys&#x27;), spookily evocative pop (&#x27;Rescue&#x27;) and Yardbirds-cum-Elevators ravers jacked up in the New Wave manner (&#x27;Do It Clean,&#x27; &#x27;Crocodiles&#x27;).&quot; Reviewing the 2003 remastered version for American music magazine &quot;Blender&quot;&#x27;s website, reviewer Andrew Harrison also gave the album four out of five stars and said, &quot;[...] the Bunnymen were a pure nihilistic thrill, with Will Sergeant&#x27;s desperate, mantra-like guitar summoning up a primal night of blinking hallucinations.&quot;

&quot;Crocodiles&quot; reached number 17 on the UK Albums Chart in July 1980. The album has since sold over copies and the band were awarded a gold disc for the album on 5 December 1984 by the British Phonographic Industry. In 1993, the &quot;NME&quot; listed &quot;Crocodiles&quot; at number 28 in its list of the 50 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2006, &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine listed the album at number 69 on its list of the 100 greatest debut albums. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Crocodiles&quot; in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list, praising &quot;Will Sergeants’ ice-dagger guitar and Les Pattinson’s spelunking bass, making “Rescue” and “Pictures on My Wall” the perfect invitations to crawl down into Ian’s hot pit of despair.&quot;

<text>The Brindabella Range, commonly called The Brindabellas or The Brindies, is a mountain range located in Australia, on a state and territory border of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The range rises to the west of Canberra, the capital city of Australia, and includes the Namadgi National Park in the ACT and the Bimberi Nature Reserve and Brindabella National Park in New South Wales. The Brindabellas are visible to the west of Canberra and form an important part of the city&#x27;s landscape.

==Location and features==
The Brindabella Range is located in the northern tip of the Australian Alps bioregion, marking the dividing line with the southern tip of the South Eastern Highlands bioregion and the eastern limits of the Riverina. The northern point of the range is Mount Coree, situated west-northwest of Canberra. From this point the range heads generally south, towards the eastern watershed of the Murrumbidgee River, in a line that marks the western edge of the ACT border with NSW. The most southern point of the range is at Bimberi Gap on the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales border. The range is located adjacent to the Bag Range, Baldy Range, Codys Ridge, Dingi Dingi Ridge and Webbs Ridge. Scabby Range and Bimberi Range lie to the south.

The geology of the range comprises block-faulted granites and Palaeozoic metamorphic rocks. There are small areas of Tertiary basalt with buried river gravels and lake sediments. The typical characteristics of the range include low-relief high plains with steep margins and slopes and fault aligned river valleys with deep gorges and waterfalls. Soils in the range change with altitude. At lower levels in forests, texture contrast soils are the norm. In the sub-alpine snow gum areas deep gradational soils with moderate amounts of organic matter are common.

Vegetation changes with altitude, aspect, cold air drainage and soil saturation. Low elevations with dry aspects carry red stringybark, white gum, broad-leaved peppermint, candlebark and brittle gum. Moist sites have alpine ash, mountain gum, narrow-leaved peppermint, manna gum and brown barrel, with tree ferns, blackwood and sassafras in gullies. Between alpine ash and mountain gum dominate and abruptly change to sub-alpine snow gum woodlands, heath, grasslands and bogs between . Common species include snow grasses, leafy bossiaea, yellow kunzea, alpine pepper and sphagnum bogs, with candle heath and swamp heath. Alpine herbfield and rare feldmark communities are found above the tree line at . Common species include prickly snow grass, alpine wallaby grass, silver snow daisy, ribbony grass, white purslane, eyebrights, gentians and buttercups. Most alpine species have a limited range.

===Peaks===
The highest mountain within the range is Bimberi Peak at , Mount Gingera at , Mount Ginini at , Mount Franklin at , Mount Aggie at , Mount Coree at , Mount Bramina at , Bulls Head at , Black Bottle Mountain at , Mount Lickhole at , and Brindabella Mountain at .

===Nature reserves and national parks===
The range straddles both the Brindabella National Park and Kosciuszko National Park, within New South Wales, and the Namadgi National Park, within the ACT and covers an area of . The Brindabella Valley, in the middle of the range, is south-west of Canberra and from Sydney. The valley is on the edge of the Snowy Mountains and the Goodradigbee River flows through the valley.

==History==
The traditional custodians of the area now known as the Brindabella Range are the Ngunnawal, Walgalu and Djimantan, all Aboriginal Australian peoples.

The Brindabella Valley, located in New South Wales to the west of the range, was first settled by Europeans as a stock outstation for the Yarralumla station in the 1830s, with the first land grant made in 1849. Gold was found in 1860 and mined from the 1880s. In 1887 the Brindabella Gold Mining Company was formed and mining continued until 1910. The valley is now an agricultural area and consists of a number of small cattle farms including the heritage-listed Brindabella Station, the childhood home of Miles Franklin, an early 20th-century Australian author.

Australian author Miles Franklin grew up in the Brindabella Valley and wrote an autobiographical work, &quot;Childhood at Brindabella&quot;, which told of her early life in the valley.

===Etymology===
The name &quot;brindabella&quot; is said to mean “two kangaroo rats” in one of the local Aboriginal language. However, another account states that &quot;Brindy brindy&quot; was a local term meaning water running over rocks and &quot;bella&quot; was added by the Europeans from the Italian &quot;bella vista&quot;, meaning &quot;beautiful view&quot;.

==Snow country==

The most northerly ski fields in Australia are located in the Brindabella Range and include the Namadgi National Park in the ACT and Bimberi Nature Reserve and Brindabella National Park in New South Wales. The highest mountain in the ACT is Bimberi Peak, which lies above the treeline at , at the northern edge of the Snowy Mountains.

A ski chalet was constructed at Mount Franklin in 1938 to service the Canberra Alpine Club. Ski runs were cleared and ski tows were improvised. The chalet later operated as a museum before being destroyed in the 2003 Canberra bushfires. A new shelter designed and built by University of Adelaide students opened in 2008. Today, cross country skiing is possible in the area, when conditions allow. Cross Country skiing is also practised at Mount Gingera, which rises above the city of Canberra to an elevation of , and is the most prominent snow-covered peak above the city.

Snow play is available at Corin Forest, near Canberra, at an elevation of . A development plan was drafted following the 2003 bushfires which would see three chairlifts installed together with snowmaking facilities and accommodation at this site.

<text>Can&#x27;t Hold Back is the seventh studio album by American country rock band Pure Prairie League, released by RCA Records. It was the first album to feature future country music star Vince Gill, who had auditioned to replace one of the Goshorn brothers. Gill jammed with the band and they offered him the position of vocalist and guitar immediately. They were not unfamiliar with Gill as, according to band member Michael Reilly, “We had seen him play in 1976 when the band he was playing with opened up for us in Oklahoma City”, remarks Reilly. “We offered him the gig then, but he said, &#x27;Oh no, I’m playing bluegrass&#x27;”. Two years later he came to Los Angeles with Byron Berline and Sundance, and after we jammed again for a few hours, we offered him the job on the spot and he accepted”.

Gill was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2007 after decades as an award winning (21 Grammys) solo act. Gill remained with Pure Prairie League for three albums.

<text>Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame, (12 December 1888 – 28 April 1978) was a senior British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, and the winner of an Olympic Games gold medal; he is the only person to achieve both distinctions.

During the Second World War, in the spring of 1941, Neame was commander of British troops in Cyrenaica (north-eastern Libya), recently conquered from the Italians by General Richard O&#x27;Connor. However, as the region was retaken by the newly-arrived Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel, Neame and O&#x27;Connor were taken prisoner. Both men remained in captivity in Italy until the autumn of 1943.

==Early life and military career==
Philip Neame was born on 12 December 1888 in Faversham in the County of Kent, the son of Kathleen Neame (née Stunt) and Frederick Neame (b. 1847). He received his education at Cheltenham College, and the British Army&#x27;s Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, Kent.

Upon graduating from the Royal Military Academy, Neame received a commission as a second lieutenant into the Royal Engineers in July 1908. He was promoted to lieutenant in August 1910, whilst serving with the 15th Field Company.

==First World War==
The declaration of war in August 1914 found Neame with the 15th Field Company in the Gibraltar Garrison. The company joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front in October 1914.

During the First Battle of Ypres in October 1914, Neame experienced first hand in the trenches the inferiority of the British issue hand-grenades compared to their German equivalent, and set about creating an alternative, the sappers improvising rudimentary but effective hand grenades made from empty jam tins filled with scrap metal, with the charge being created using gun-cotton, and a cord-fuse projecting from the end of the tin, requiring ignition by flame.

===Victoria Cross===
Neame was 26 years old when the following deed took place, for which he received the Victoria Cross (VC):

During a minor night trench action on the Western Front in the Neuve Chapelle district five days before Christmas 1914, Neame was leading a party of sappers in action when he was requested by the commanding officer of a battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment to go forward and to strengthen the defences in a recently captured German trench. When he got there he met another commissioned officer who informed him that the Germans were counter-attacking with bombs, that his own bombers had all been wounded and that the bombs that were left would not go off. At this Neame went further up the trench to the contact point to talk to one of the surviving bombers there, and discovered that the problem was that he wasn&#x27;t able use the bombs because there were no fuzee matches left. Neame, knowing how to technically ignite the grenades without a fuzee match by holding a regular match-head on the grenade&#x27;s fuse and striking a match box across it, commenced lighting and throwing grenades in this fashion into the German trenches at the two different directions where a German dawn counter-attack was materializing, holding it back whilst under continual return fire for forty-five minutes whilst the West Yorks Regiment evacuated its wounded behind him back towards the original British frontline trench.

Neame was promoted to the rank of captain in 1915, and was mentioned in despatches in February 1915, and again in January 1916. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in January 1916.

After a short period as a staff officer (GSO3) from October 1915, he was appointed brigade major of the 168th Brigade, 56th (London) Division, in February 1916, staffing this post through the Somme offensive in 1916, including the actions at Gommecourt on 1 July, and the Battle of Ginchy in September, until relinquishing it for another staff (GSO2) assignment in November 1916.

He was promoted to brevet major in the 1917 New Year honours list. He received further mentions in despatches in January and December 1917. In June 1918 he moved up to a senior staff post (GSO1), and ended the war in November 1918 with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel.

==Inter-war military career and Olympian==
Neame was honoured for his war service in France with the Legion of Honour (&quot;Croix de Chevalier&quot;) in January 1919, and the Croix de guerre in July. He was also awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre. In June 1919 he was noted in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; as being amongst several names intended for the rank of brevet lieutenant-colonel, with the substantive rank of major. but the actual gazetting to brevet lieutenant-colonel did not appear until June 1922, and his substantive rank was finally promoted from captain to major in January 1925.
Neame was a member of Great Britain&#x27;s 1924 Olympic Running Deer team at Paris and is the only Victoria Cross recipient who has won an Olympic gold medal. The Running Deer competition was one of the shooting events at the games. It involved teams of four (firing single shots), where a moving target simulated the animal.

After serving as an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, from March 1919 to April 1923, Neame was appointed brigade major of an Infantry Brigade at Aldershot in January 1924 and then saw service in India with the Bengal Sappers and Miners from 1925 before attending the Imperial Defence College in 1930. In June 1932 Neame was promoted full colonel (skipping the substantive lieutenant-colonel rank) and became a General Staff Officer 1 in the Waziristan District in India. In 1933 he was badly mauled by a tigress whilst hunting in India. He was admitted to a hospital, Lady Minto Nursing Association, in Bareilly where he was nursed to health by Harriet Alberta Drew. He married the nurse, taking leave from India towards the end of 1933 whereupon he was on half pay without appointment until May 1934.

In July 1934 Neame was given temporary brigadier rank to take up an appointment as Brigadier General Staff with Eastern Command in India. In 1938 he was promoted to major-general and returned to England as Commandant of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1938. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in January 1939.

==Second World War==
While Commandant at the Military College, Neame had been given to understand that should war be declared, he would be appointed as Chief of General Staff to the British Expeditionary Force&#x27;s putative C-in-C, John Dill. In the event, Lord Gort was appointed C-in-C, with Henry Pownall as CGS and Neame as his deputy responsible for operations and staff duties. Neame organised defences and planned for the campaign, but in February 1940 he was posted to Egypt to command the 4th Indian Infantry Division.

===Middle East theatre===
In August 1940 Neame was made General Officer Commanding British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan in the acting rank of lieutenant-general where his responsibilities were mainly in the area of internal security (the local police forces being placed under his direction).

===Defeat in North Africa===
In February 1941 Neame was appointed General Officer Commanding &amp; Military Governor of Cyrenaica, which had been captured from the Italians by the British Empire&#x27;s rapid advance in the opening moves of the North African campaign during Operation Compass. Whilst being responsible for a large area of ground, Neame&#x27;s command had been stripped of many of its battle-hardened units, which had been withdrawn towards Cairo either for re-fitting, or to take part in the Battle of Greece, and he was left with little air support from the constrained Royal Air Force (RAF) units available in North Africa at this time.

The two primary formations under his command to guard Cyrenaica were the newly fielded 2nd Armoured Division, and 9th Australian Division. The 2nd Armoured Division had only recently arrived from the British Isles, was under-strength, lacking in training and equipment adapted for desert warfare conditions, and proved to be no match for what it was about to meet in the field in the form of Nazi Germany&#x27;s First Axis Offensive in North Africa, which was launched at the end of March 1941 by its newly arrived Afrika Korps, led by General Erwin Rommel. Australia&#x27;s 9th Division, while well led by Leslie Morshead, was not yet fully trained, and was suffering from a shortage of transport vehicles.

====First Axis Offensive in North Africa====

Neame&#x27;s Headquarters lacked accurate intelligence information from its senior command echelon, and had no warning about the nature or scale of the massed attack that it was about to be hit with, in a theatre scenario which was thought to be dormant at that time through Italian massed defeat and tactical acquiescence, and he was further hampered by an over-extended line of supply stretching back over many hundreds of miles to Alexandria and Cairo. With hesitant handling of his unprepared troop dispositions in response to a rapidly changing and unexpectedly threatening situation, as the Afrika Korps and Italian Army poured toward him at a terrific speed of advance and began on 24 March 1941 to attack his units&#x27; outposts and appear suddenly amidst, and even far behind them in the lines of supply routes, and his command being limited in effective control by a Headquarters not sited in a battle station and remote from the action, Neame was over the next few days of fighting overwhelmed by Rommel. Faced with the apparent danger of the 2nd Armoured Division&#x27;s disintegration which he perceived from its chaotic radio-traffic as it struggled to cope with the rolling blows it was receiving, he ordered the forces under him to fall back eastward in an uncoordinated fashion to avoid being cut off and completely destroyed by the sudden advance of the enemy.

On 6 April 1941, while driving in a small convoy of vehicles to a newly established Headquarters, Neame and his travelling companions, Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor (who had been rapidly dispatched to join Neame&#x27;s Headquarters by General Archibald Wavell who was alarmed at the apparent collapse of Neame&#x27;s forces) and Brigadier John Combe, were over-run and captured by a German advanced force led by Gerhard von Schwerin. Disaster was averted for the majority of the forces under Neame&#x27;s command through a rapid retreat by the 9th Australian Division into the coastal town of Tobruk, where it was joined by 3 Indian Motor Brigade, and surviving remnants of 2nd Armoured Division (most of which had been over-run and captured in the rout), in hastily organising a defensive perimeter, which would go on to withstand the Axis Forces&#x27; subsequent extended siege.

===Prisoner of war in Italy===
Along with the almost 3000 men of the 2nd Armoured Division who had been captured in Rommel&#x27;s advance, Neame with generals O&#x27;Connor and Combe were transported across the Mediterranean Sea for incarceration in Italy, first being held as prize prisoners at the Villa Orsini near Sulmona, then at Castello di Vincigliata PG12 near Florence. Whilst at PG12 they took part in a number of escape attempts along with General Adrian Carton de Wiart (a fellow VC recipient), and Edward Todhunter.

After the successful escape of six men through a tunnel that Neame had designed in April 1943, including two New Zealander brigadiers James Hargest and Reginald Miles who disappeared in the direction of Switzerland, the Italian Army in reprisal sent Neame&#x27;s batman Gunner Pickford (Royal Horse Artillery) to another camp.

Following the Italian Armistice in September 1943, Neame was released from incarceration by the Italian Army, but faced a hazardous journey of several hundred miles through a semi-chaotic countryside, at that time still occupied by German forces, in areas in conflict with the Italians, to reach the safety of the joint British and American lines. Having hidden a manuscript which he had been writing in captivity of his memoires (to be recovered after the war), Neame&#x27;s party, including Air Marshal Owen Boyd and General Richard O&#x27;Connor, made their way southwards with the help of friendly Italians along the route. Hiring a boat at Cattolica they sailed to the port of Termoli which by the time of their arrival on 20 December 1943 had fallen into the possession of the advancing Allied armies.

===Repatriation to England===
Arriving back in England on 25 December 1943, having travelled via Tunis (after interviews with Generals Dwight Eisenhower and Harold Alexander, and also Winston Churchill), Neame found there was no job waiting for him in the army, with his star in the descendent after the debacle of his capture in 1941, but he remained on the Active List until the end of the war in his substantive rank of major-general.

==Postwar military career and retirement==

In August 1945 Neame was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey in the local rank of lieutenant-general where he served until 1953. He also held the honorary posts of Colonel Commandant of the Corps of Royal Engineers from February 1945 to 1955 and Colonel 131 (Airborne) Engineer Regiment from January 1948.

Neame was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1946, and made a knight of the charitable Order of St John in the same year. In January 1955 he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Kent.

==Personal life==
Neame married Harriet Drew (1906–1994) in 1934, the marriage producing four children: Gerald (born 1935), Veronica (born 1937), Nigel (born 1946), Philip (born 1946). His youngest child, also named Philip, served as commander of D Company, 2 Para, in 1982 during the Falklands War.

Neame died at Selling in Kent on 28 April 1978, in his eighty-ninth year. His body was buried in the graveyard of St Mary the Virgin Church, in Selling. His medals and awards are held by the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>In geometry, the trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (). It contains 20 triangles, 30 squares and 12 pentagons. It is also a canonical polyhedron.

It can be constructed as a rhombicosidodecahedron with three pentagonal cupolae rotated through 36 degrees. Related Johnson solids are:
* The gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron () where one cupola is rotated;
* The parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron () where two opposing cupolae are rotated;
* And the metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron () where two non-opposing cupolae are rotated.

<text>Kun Khmer ( ), or Pradal Serey ( ), is a combat sport that originated in Cambodia. The sport consists of stand up striking and clinch fighting, where the objective is to knock an opponent out, force a technical knockout, or win a match by points. The sport was codified in Cambodia by the French colonial administration in the early 20th century, and was derived from centuries-old traditions, namely Bokator, the close-quarter combat system used during the Khmer empire. The official Khmer name of the sport is Kbach Kun Pradal Khmer ( ).

Kun Khmer consists of four types of strikes: punches, kicks, elbows, and knee strikes. The clinch is used to wear down the opponent. In the clinch, opponents battle for the dominant position for short range strikes by way of elbows and knees. Kun Khmer is most well-known for its kicking and elbows technique. The roundhouse kick generates power from hip rotation rather than snapping the leg. The front kick is called sniet theak trang(straight push kick technique) or chrot eysei(hermit&#x27;s crutch). The push kick is considered easy and simple to use in fights. The push kick can be used on areas that are not carefully guarded by the opponent. The push kick can be delivered by the ball of the foot or the heel of the foot. The push kick can be used to attack below the waist, the chest and the middle of the face. Cambodian fighters tend to utilize more elbow strikes than that of other martial arts in the region. In Kun Khmer, more victories come by way of an elbow technique than any other strikes.

==History==

Kun Khmer developed from the ancient Khmer martial arts, now commonly referred to as &quot;Bokator&quot;. Dating back to the 1st century AD, the martial arts in Cambodia are deeply rooted in the country&#x27;s history, and are depicted in the various bas-reliefs of the Angkor period. Um Yurann, the deputy director of the Cambodian Boxing Federation, highlights the bas-reliefs found on the ancient walls of the Angkor temples, dating from the ninth to the twelfth century, as evidence that Cambodians have been engaged in the sport for hundreds of years. Archaeologist Phoeung Dara has noted that several bas-relief sculptures depicting Cambodian martial arts are associated with Kun Khmer. These artistic representations are located in various temples, including Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prohm, Banteay Samre, Preah Khan, and Prei Temples. 

During the early 20th century, the local martial traditions were codified by the French administration, giving birth to &quot;Pradal Serey,&quot; now more widely known as &quot;Kun Khmer&quot;. Boxing matches were originally fought in dirt pits with limited rules, while hands were wrapped in rope. From 1920 to 1930, it was common for boxing matches to result in deaths. Fighters in Battambang province, during the early 20th century, utilized glove-like knuckle dusters made from shells to inflict injuries on their opponents in kickboxing matches. According to Pel Yat, an elderly villager from Battambang, as documented in a 1974 publication regarding the social history of the province, “Boxers fought until death. During the bout, a stretcher to carry out the dead was brought in; it was kept there in case a boxer died. The winner received a prize from the committee.” Chhit Sarim, a kickboxer instructor from Siem Reap, described tournaments around his village from the first half of the last century, &quot;Coffins were placed near the ring ready for the possibility of a dead loser. The boxers did not use gloves to protect from injury, they just wrapped silk thread around their fists. On their arms they tied katei - magical plants
wrapped in red pieces of cloth that would cause their opponent to see multiple images of their body in the ring. They were great boxers.&quot; In order to avoid the fatal casualties, the French set up a series of rules that combined Western boxing with Khmer boxing.

 France organized its own athletes to face off against Cambodian athletes. Recognizing the impressive capabilities of Khmer martial arts, particularly in the use of elbows, knees, fists, and other lethal techniques, including those that could result in neck injuries, the French administration introduced a modified version of boxing. This new sport mandated that all participants wear gloves, imposed time limits on matches, instituted rest periods, and prohibited certain techniques to mitigate risks to life. The intention behind this French initiative was to restrict the abilities of Khmer competitors while providing an opportunity for French athletes familiar with Khmer martial arts to secure victories in the contests. Subsequently, this definition evolved into the established rules of the game, leading to its recognition as a popular sport. Freestyle boxing(pradal serey) represents a fusion of the universal sport of boxing, rooted in European tradition, and the traditional martial arts of the Khmer culture. Through an agreement between French and Cambodian working groups, specific regulations were implemented, including prohibitions on additional time for falls, neck strikes, the use of protective gear, and other lethal techniques. This sport gained popularity during the French colonial period and subsequently spread to Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and various other nations under the French sphere of influence.

The introduction of boxing rings, rounds, and gloves, as well as the prohibition of life-threatening techniques, transformed the local martial arts into a sport. With those new sets of rules, French and Khmer boxers would compete against each other in tournaments. In the 1960s, Cambodian boxing promoters held inter-martial arts exhibitions.

===Downfall of Kun Khmer===

During the chaos of the Vietnam War, Cambodia was undergoing its own civil war. On April 17, 1975, the Maoist Communist rebels, the Khmer Rouge under the orders of Pol Pot, overthrew the government of the Khmer Republic then-led by Lon Nol. The Khmer Rouge&#x27;s plan was to eliminate modern society, and create an agrarian utopia. The Khmer Rouge executed educated people, others who had ties to the old government, or anyone who was believed to be “advantaged” by the old society (doctors, teachers, soldiers, actors, singers, boxers, etc.), and forced the remaining Khmer population into labor camps—in which hundreds of thousands died in executions, starvation and diseases—to be re-educated under the new government. Traditional martial arts were banned at this time, and many boxers were executed or worked to death, which nearly caused the demise of Kun Khmer. An estimated 1.7 million Cambodians, or 21% of the population, died during the Khmer Rouge regime, according to the studies of the Cambodia Genocide Program of Yale University. This despotic subjugation lasted for four years until 1979, when the Vietnamese, invaded and overthrew the Khmer Rouge. During the relative stability with the Vietnamese’s protection and after the departure of the Vietnamese, the Kingdom of Cambodia, reestablished the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the countries traditional arts were attempted to be revived, including Kun Khmer.
===Revival of Kun Khmer===
Kun Khmer made a strong comeback since its prohibition in the 1970s. Chhith Sarim, a coach in the sport of Khmer kickboxing, expressed regret over Cambodia&#x27;s loss of prominence in the kickboxing arena during periods of conflict. Despite this setback, he remains resolute in his efforts to restore the country&#x27;s standing in the sport. Cambodia has made an effort to popularise its style of boxing, despite the lack of financial funding. Numerous gyms have opened, and large masses of students, local and foreign, have come to train in Cambodia. There are weekly matches held, the majority televised live, and many of Cambodia&#x27;s best have traveled internationally to compete. There are currently approximately 70 boxing clubs nationwide. In 1987, one of the first Kun Khmer schools abroad opened in the United States. It was started by a former national champion by the name of Oumry Ban in Cambodia Town, Long Beach, California.

Kun Khmer is administered in Cambodia by the Cambodian Boxing Federation (CBF), formerly the Cambodian Amateur Boxing Federation (CABF), which was established in 1961. All referees, judges, and fighters must be licensed by the CABF. Television stations which hold Khmer boxing tournaments do so under the supervision of the CBF. The individual stations are responsible for organizing boxers, trainers, medical staff, and musicians. The CBF supplies the match referees, judges, and time-keepers. The current president of the CBF is Major-General Tem Moeun. 

Abroad, Cambodian boxing is promoted by four organizations. These organizations include: the European Khmer Boxing Federation, based in Germany; the Fédération des Arts Martiaux Khmers (FAMK), based in France; the Ánh Binh Minh Khmer Martial Arts Association, located in Vietnam; and Kun Khmer Australia, based in Australia. Other newly created organizations can be found in Spain and Italy, while Belgium is in the process of forming its own Khmer boxing organization. The International Sport Kickboxing Association (ISKA), based in the United Kingdom, has held matches involving Cambodian boxers. Additionally, Khmer boxers have fought abroad in countries such as South Korea.

There have been concerns about the betting and rowdiness among Kun Khmer fans. Commenting on how the behavior of boxing audiences has noticeably worsened over the years, Cambodian trainer Chiit Sarim has remarked, “I traveled from pagoda to pagoda to box at competitions during the water festival. Pagodas were the traditional venue for boxing matches... They [the current fans] act inappropriately. They raise up their hands and scream noisily. They gamble and do not respect the boxers. They think of only winning their bet. During my time, there was no such thing. Fights were organized nicely and were very popular. Now, fans have no morality.”

Tournaments are screened live on national television. TV5 Cambodia holds live tournaments on Friday and Sunday, CTN holds live tournaments on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Bayon Television holds live kickboxing tournaments on Saturday and Sunday, while TV3 holds a single tournament on Sunday, and Apsara TV has added a single tournament on Thursday.

Recently, travel journalists and tourists have exposed Kun Khmer to the western world. Features in television programs have further popularized the martial art amongst global viewers; Kun Khmer was featured on The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Human Weapon,&quot; and was also mentioned on the Cambodian episode of Globetrekker. In February 2009, American footballer Dhani Jones filmed an episode of his series Dhani Tackles the Globe in Phnom Penh, training with Long Salavorn at the Salavorn Keila club, and subsequently fighting Pan Phanith at the CTN arena.

Songchai Ratanasuban, the number-one promoter in Thailand, brought his S1 Promotion to Phnom Penh in June 2005. In the Cambodian S1 World Championship, Bun Sothea won the tournament. He defeated Michael Paszowski, Dzhabar Askerov, and Lor Samnang in front of 30,000 people at the Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium.

In 2008, the Cambodian Television Network (CTN) screened a Kun Khmer reality television series called &quot;Kun Khmer Champion&quot;. The show featured 65 kilogramme (143.3 lbs.) boxers, and was produced by Ma Serey and Aaron Leverton, and co-hosted by Ma Serey and Cambodia&#x27;s most famous kickboxer, Eh Phouthong. The first series was followed by a second in 20097 and a third in 2010, both co-hosted by Vorn Viva.

On August 28, 2008, Cambodian boxers Vorn Viva and Meas Chantha won the ISKA Middleweight and Welterweight world titles in Phnom Penh. It was the first time a Cambodian had held a kickboxing world title.

In 2011, Prime Minister Hun Sen created a committee responsible for documenting and researching the sport of Khmer kickboxing in order to have it included on UNESCO&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage list. The 19-member committee included Culture Minister Him Chhem, the boxing federation, Council of Minister officials, and other officials from other government ministries.

In 2011, there were 1,000 registered boxers from 78 martial arts schools.

As of 2012, there are over 50 Kun Khmer fights held every week in the Phnom Penh region.

===Post-Recovery Era===

A well-known promoter stated 2020 would be an important year for development of the sport. Promoter, Matias Andres, via the Riel Team was focused on putting the sport in an international context instead of just focusing on the local scene.

Town Full HDTV brought MAS Fight, a global professional martial arts organization, to Cambodia. It was welcomed as a programme to help promote Kun Khmer internationally.

In 2022, the International Professional Combat Council (IPCC) held their first sanctioned Kun Khmer event in Kampong Speu province.

In 2023, the BKK (Bare Knuckle Kombat) Championship held their first Kun Khmer event.

In 2024, a Kun Khmer event called “Ganzberg Kun Khmer to the World Class” was the first Kun Khmer event to take place in South Korea.

In 2024, Kun Khmer had a historic first-ever event called International Cambodian Kun Khmer Championship on the Greek island of Crete in Heraklion.

In 2024, Chinese martial arts organization, Kunlun Fight, held a Kun Khmer and kickboxing event in Cambodia called Kunlun Fight &amp; Cicada FC.

The 5th Kun Khmer World Championship were held in Siem Reap. The top 5 medal countries were Cambodia(first place), Kyrgyzstan(second place), Afghanistan(third place), Russia(fourth place) and France(fifth place).

The 6th World Kun Khmer Championship is scheduled to be hosted in Indonesia in 2025.

===Attempt to unite regional boxing styles===
Nearby Southeast Asian countries have similar styles of boxing martial arts. At an ASEAN meeting in 1995, Cambodia suggested that the Thai boxing style, Muay Thai, be referred to as &quot;Sovannaphum boxing,&quot; or &quot;SEA Boxing,&quot; which would collectively represent Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. &quot;Sovannaphum&quot; means &quot;golden land&quot; in Khmer, and is written as &quot;Suwannabhumi&quot; in Thai. The name refers to mainland Southeast Asia in the ancient Indian language of Pali.

However, Thailand would not compromise, stating that each Southeast Asian country has its own boxing style, and that Thailand was responsible for making its boxing style an international sport. When it debuted at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, Cambodia did not enter the Muay Thai event in protest of the name used to refer to the sport. At subsequent Southeast Asian Games, Southeast Asian boxing has been known by the ethnically neutral term &quot;muay,&quot; with the exception of the 2009 Southeast Asian Games in Vientiane, when the sport was called Muay Lao. The decision did not spark any controversy or negative reaction from Thailand or Cambodia at that time.

At the 2023 Southeast Asian Games, held in Cambodia, the event was called Kun Khmer instead of Muay Thai, which led to a boycott by Thailand. In response, Cambodia said it would retaliate by not sending boxers to the 2025 games in Thailand. The Secretary-general of the Cambodian Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee, Vath Chamroeun, asserted, “We are the host country, so we have the right to change it to Kun Khmer, as the sport has its origin in Khmer, and it is our culture.” Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen addressed the issue by proposing, “When competing in Cambodia, we call it Kun Khmer; when competing in Thailand, we call it Muay Thai; when competing in Laos, we call it Muay Lao; and in Myanmar, we call it the name of their original martial arts. Can we find a compromise?” 

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has suggested that Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand jointly apply for UNESCO status for traditional martial arts. Initially, Muay Lao Federation’s President, Saysamone Sayasone, supported the renaming, and concurred that the sport originated indeed in Cambodia. However, amidst severe backlash from Thailand, he was compelled to apologise for his statements. The International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) threatened six member-countries from Southeast Asia—Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore—with a two-year ban on any IFMA competitions and activities, should they join the competition. Eventually, only Thai athletes boycotted the competition.

==Life as a boxer==
Kun Khmer is an athletic sport that relies on agility, toughness, and flexibility. Most participants are young adults due to the physical conditioning that a boxer must endure to keep their body in shape. The average age ranges from 14 to 25. Most Cambodian boxers come from impoverished backgrounds, and compete to earn money to feed their families and themselves. Top kickboxers can have as many as 200–300 fights in their careers.

Cambodian boxers were traditionally paid by the crowd. If the crowd appreciated the boxer&#x27;s efforts, they would reward him with food, alcohol, and cash. This practice still continues today, but in line with western practices, bouts pay official fees. Until recently, the average purse for a fight was US$15. Today, purses are based on experience. A new Cambodian boxer can earn US$25 per fight, while more experienced kickboxers with more than a dozen fights can earn up to $75. &quot;Brand name&quot; kickboxers can earn over $100 a fight. Special purse fights will pay up to $250, with the purse contributed by a corporate sponsor. &quot;International&quot; tournaments, organised by the broadcasters, will pay individual purses of up to $1000, sometimes higher.

An estimated 70% of boxers in the Phnom Penh circuit come from the rural northwest. The provinces of Battambang and Banteay Meanchey produce a steady supply of boxers. Some of the best Kun Khmer champions come from the Battambang Province, although a number of big name stars have come via Southern Cambodia, such as Eh Phouthong from Koh Kong Province, Thun Sophea from Svay Rieng Province, and Meas Chantha and Seng Makara from Kandal Province. Cambodian boxers train in a gym under a Kun Khmer kru. 
The grandmasters that are responsible for preserving traditions are known as achar. Many boxers train 6–8 hours a day and 7 days a week.

==Khmer Boxing Federation==
The Khmer boxing federation was reestablished in 1996. It has had four presidents. Khov Chhay is the current president after the resignation of Tem Meun in 2024.

1. Prum Pich: first term, (1996-2000)

2. Um Yurann: second term (2000-2004), third term (2004-2008)

3. Tem Meun: fourth term(2008-2012), fifth term(2012-2016), sixth term(2016-2021), seventh term (2021-2025)

4. Khov Chhay: Continuation of 7th term (2024-2025)

==Health risk==

As with all contact sports, health risks are a factor. According to Chhoeung Yavyen, a ringside doctor for the Cambodian Amateur Boxing Association, in the past five years, 30 kickboxers have sustained serious injury in the ring, including broken wrists, arms, shins, noses, and jaws, in addition to dislodged shoulders and hip injuries. One Cambodian boxer died in the ring in Svay Rieng Province in 2001, but that death was the result of a heart attack, probably brought on by diet pills consumed to help the boxer reduce his weight before the bout. Most of the injuries suffered are curable and don&#x27;t leave lasting problems. Most boxers are allowed to return to the ring after receiving treatment.

==Rules and match setup==
A match consists of five three-minute rounds and takes place in a 6.1 meter square boxing ring. A one-and-a-half or two-minute break occurs between each round. In olden times, ancient Khmer people would do praying rituals before going to the battlefield or war.
 At the beginning of each match the boxers practice the praying rituals known as the kun kru or thvayobangkoum krou. There are different variations of the thvayobangkoum krou ritual with different names such as &quot;Hanuman ties the bridge to Sita&quot;. There are 17 different variations of the ritual. Most are based on the main characters of the Reamker story and believe to have occurred when Cambodia had a strong belief in Hinduism. The pre-competition teacher offering ritual also serves to warm the muscle and increase blood flow.
The praying ritual at the preliminaries of the boxing match is considered a real dance. Traditional Cambodian music performed with the instruments of the &quot;sampho&quot; (a type of drum), the sralai klang khek (oboe) and the chhing is played during the match. The music of Khmer boxing is called vung phleng pradall or vung phleng klang khek. The music is made up of two sections. The first section is for the boxer&#x27;s teachers while the second section is the fight music. The first part uses a spirit(teacher) to help the boxers concentrate their minds and have confidence. The first part of the music is played slowly in a rubato style. The melody is played by the sralai(oboe) and the sampho(drum) plays strokes at important points of the melody. The second part which is the fight music is played much faster and in meter. The music accelerates with the progression of the round. It stops at the end of the round or when someone is knocked out. When the fight is exciting, the audience claps in rhythm with the beat of the sampho(drum).
 Modern boxers wear leather gloves and nylon shorts.

Rules:
# A boxer is not allowed to strike his opponent while he is on the ground.
# A boxer is not allowed to bite.
# When an opponent cannot continue, the referee stops the fight.
# Blows to the back of the opponent are not allowed.
# A boxer may not hold on to the ropes.
# Blows to the genitals are prohibited.

Victory can be obtained by knockout. A knockout occurs when a boxer is knocked down to the ground and cannot continue fighting after a 10-second count by the referee, a referee may forgo the count and declare a knockout if it is obvious the boxer will not regain his feet unaided. Victory can be obtained at the end of the match when judges decide by a point system which fighter was more effective. If fighters end up with the same score a draw is called.

<text>William Clark Falkner (July 6, 1825 or 1826 – November 6, 1889) was a military veteran, businessman, and author in northern Mississippi. He is most notable for the influence he had on the work of his great-grandson, author William Faulkner.

==Family background==

He was born in Knox County, Tennessee, to Joseph Falkner (or Forkner or Faulkner) and Caroline Word (or Ward). Both Caroline&#x27;s paternal grandfather Charles and his brother Cuthbert died during the American Revolutionary War while serving under the command of George Washington. Her father, Thomas Adams Word, moved the family to Georgia in 1812. Caroline&#x27;s sister, Justianna Dickinson Word, married John Wesley Thompson, who in 1834 was arrested for killing a man during a fight. He was acquitted, and afterwards he moved with Justianna to Ripley, Mississippi. Thompson eventually became a district attorney and later a district judge in Mississippi.

William Clark Falkner lived with his family in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri and Pontotoc, Mississippi, joining the Thompsons in Ripley in 1842. In 1847, he married Holland Pearce. Their only child John Wesley Thompson Falkner, named after WC&#x27;s uncle, was born in 1848. Holland died in 1849. Elizabeth Houston Vance (1833–1910) became his second wife in 1851. They were the parents of eight children:

*William Henry Falkner (1853–1878) - son
*Willett Medora Falkner Carter (1856–1918) - daughter
*Thomas Vance Falkner (1859–1861) - son
*Lizzie Manassah Falkner (1861–1861) - daughter
*Fannie Forest Falkner Dogan (1866–1929) - daughter
*Effie Falkner Davis (1868–1957) - daughter
*Alabama Leroy Falkner McLean (1874–1968) - daughter
*Unknown (died young)

==Military service==

He served in the Mexican–American War as First Lieutenant of the 2nd Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers. Per Richard Bruce Winders&#x27; history of the Mississippi Rifles:

When the American Civil War broke out, he raised a company of men and was made colonel in the Second Mississippi Infantry of the Confederate Army, leading the regiment at the First Battle of Bull Run. Later, he was demoted in an election of officers, so he returned to Mississippi in the summer of 1862 and formed a unit known as the 1st Mississippi Partisan Rangers. Falkner&#x27;s new regiment suffered major losses during raids by Federal cavalry in November 1862 and April 1863. Frustrated in his ambitions to gain a promotion to brigadier general, Falkner resigned his officer&#x27;s commission in October 1863. He never regained a prominent role in the Confederate Army, but he was forever known as &quot;Colonel Falkner&quot; or just &quot;The Old Colonel&quot; after the war.

==Later life and death==

During Reconstruction, he was active in rebuilding northern Mississippi and founded the Ship Island, Ripley, and Kentucky Railroad Company. The first station on the line north of Ripley was located in what is now the community of Falkner.

On November 5, 1889, he was shot by Richard Jackson Thurmond, a former business partner. The motive for the shooting was believed to have been a lingering grudge dating back to their partnership. Falkner had just been elected to serve in the Mississippi legislature. He died the next day.

==Literary works==

Falkner was also an author, writing novels, poems, a travelogue, and at least one play. His most famous work was a novel entitled &quot;The White Rose of Memphis&quot; (New York, G. W. Carleton &amp; co.; 1881), a murder mystery set on board a steamboat of the same name. This work was popular enough to be reprinted several times through the early 20th century, selling over 160,000 copies.

==Influence==
WC Falkner&#x27;s oldest child John Wesley Thompson Falkner was the father of Murry Cuthbert Falkner. Murry&#x27;s oldest child was Nobel Laureate author William Faulkner. As a child, William (who later changed his surname to Faulkner) reportedly said, &quot;I want to be a writer like my great-granddaddy.&quot; The elder Falkner served as the model for the character of Colonel John Sartoris, who appeared in the novels &quot;Sartoris&quot; (1929; reissued in an expanded edition as &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot;, 1973) and &quot;The Unvanquished&quot; (1938), as well as a number of short stories. Thus, Colonel Falkner is the inspiration for an integral part of the history of Faulkner&#x27;s fictional Yoknapatawpha County. Faulkner&#x27;s short story &quot;Knight&#x27;s Gambit&quot; (in the 1949 collection &quot;Knight&#x27;s Gambit&quot;) has been viewed as including a commentary on Falkner&#x27;s &quot;The White Rose of Memphis&quot; (1881).

==Legacy==
Bimal Roy&#x27;s influence was far-reaching, both in Indian cinema and world cinema. In Indian cinema, his influence extended to both mainstream commercial Hindi cinema and the emerging Parallel Cinema. His film (1953) was the first film to successfully straddle art and commercial cinema. It was a commercial and critical success, winning the International Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. As a result, the film&#x27;s success paved the way for the Indian New Wave.

In commercial cinema, the most influential film he directed was perhaps &quot;Madhumati&quot; (1958), his first and only collaboration with Ritwik Ghatak (who wrote the screenplay), and one of the earliest films to deal with reincarnation. It is believed to have been the source of inspiration for many later works dealing with the theme of reincarnation in Indian cinema, Indian television, and perhaps world cinema. It may have been the source of inspiration for the American film &quot;The Reincarnation of Peter Proud&quot; (1975) and the Hindi film &quot;Karz&quot; (1980), both of which dealt with reincarnation and have been influential in their respective cultures. &quot;Karz&quot; in particular was remade several times: as the Kannada film &quot;Yuga Purusha&quot; (1989), the Tamil film &quot;Enakkul Oruvan&quot; (1984), and more recently the Bollywood film &quot;Karzzzz&quot; (2008). &quot;Karz&quot; may have also inspired the American film &quot;Chances Are&quot; (1989). The most recent film to be directly inspired by &quot;Madhumati&quot; is the hit Bollywood film &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; (2007), which led to Roy&#x27;s daughter Rinki Bhattacharya accusing the film of plagiarism and threatening legal action against its producers.

Bimal Roy discovered and gave a break to many children, such as Asha Parekh&quot;,&quot; Sona Mastan Mirza, Baby Farida, &amp; Baby Sonu (Bablani), who would later become quite famous.

Bimal Roy&#x27;s films continue to be screened at major national and international film festivals in India, Europe and North America. His films are being restored and digitised by the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) at Pune. In July 2014, Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai hosted an exhibition; &quot;Bimal Roy: Life &amp; Times&quot;, organised in collaboration with his children. The exhibits included screening of the films; &quot;Madhumati&quot;, &quot;Sujata&quot; and &quot;Bandini&quot;, besides film posters, costumes and memorabilia, including an Arriflex camera used to shoot &quot;Devdas&quot; and &quot;Sujata&quot;.

The Bimal Roy Memorial Trophy has been awarded every year since 1997, by the Bimal Roy Memorial &amp; Film Society to honor both experienced artists and other contributors from the Indian film industry as well as new and upcoming outstanding young filmmakers.
A postage stamp, bearing his face, was released by India Post to honour him on 8 January 2007.

<text>László Kovács (; born 3 July 1939) is a Hungarian politician and diplomat, former European Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union. He was the foreign minister of Hungary twice, from 1994 to 1998 and from 2002 to 2004. He also served as chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) from 1998 to 2004.

==Studies==
László Kovács was born in Budapest on 3 July 1939. He finished at Petrik Lajos Technical School of Industrial Chemistry in 1957. From 1957 to 1966 he worked as a chemical technician. He graduated from the Foreign Trade Department of the Karl Marx University of Economics in 1968 and from the College of Politics of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP) in 1980.

==Party career==
He joined the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party in 1963. From 1966 he worked for the International Department of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Young Communist League (KISZ) and was subsequently its director. He worked for the Foreign Affairs Department of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party from 1975, acting as deputy director from 1983 to 1986. He was Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs from May 1986 and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from May 1989 to May 1990. He was elected a member of the party&#x27;s Central Committee (KB) in April 1989.

Kovács was a founder of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) in October 1989, becoming a member of the presidium of the National Board in May 1990. He was party spokesman on foreign affairs from November 1990. He became party chairman on 5 September 1998, replacing Gyula Horn. He was confirmed in this office on 29 March 2003, however he resigned in 2004, when he was appointed European Commissioner.

==Political positions==
He was a Member of Parliament since 1990 (having been elected from the party&#x27;s National List in 1990, from the Győr-Moson-Sopron County Regional List in 1994 and 1998 and from the Budapest Regional List in 2002). From 1990 to 1994 he was a member of the Hungarian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, becoming deputy leader of the delegation after the change of government following the 1998 parliamentary election. From 1998 until the 2002 parliamentary election he was deputy leader of the delegations to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the Western European Union Assembly. He was a member of the Committee of Wise Persons of the Council of Europe.

Kovács served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Cabinet of Gyula Horn from 15 July 1994 to 8 July 1998. From June 1998 to December 2000 he was the leader of the Socialists&#x27; parliamentary group and deputy leader from January 2001. He secured a seat on the Budapest Regional List in April 2002. Since 27 May 2002 he had once again been in charge of Hungarian diplomacy as foreign minister until 30 September 2004.

===EU career===

His name linked to the 31 March 1998 opening of negotiations on accession to the European Union, as well as to the completion of these negotiations on 13 December 2002. At the beginning of November 2003 the twenty-five members of the Presidential Committee of Socialist International elected him deputy chairman representing the entire Central and East European Region. During the European Parliament elections on 13 June 2004 he headed his party&#x27;s list.

In 2004, Kovács was nominated to serve as the Hungarian member of the European Commission, which was to take office on 1 November 2004. His apparent unsuitability for his proposed role as Energy Commissioner was one of the reasons why the European Parliament refused to endorse the proposed new Commission. However, the Hungarian government did not nominate a new commissioner in his place, therefore in the revised setup of the commission, serving from 22 November 2004, he was finally appointed as Commissioner responsible for Taxation and Customs Union.

László Andor became the next Hungarian European Commissioner in the second Barroso Commission. Kovács returned to Hungary and was elected to the National Assembly of Hungary from the party&#x27;s National List during the 2010 parliamentary election.

==Personal life==
He married Mária Éva Tóth in 1968. The couple had a daughter, Dóra (born in 1977). Mária Éva died in 2013. He has a son, László (born in 2011) from another relationship. He remarried in 2015.

<text>John Henry Waddell (February 14, 1921 – November 27, 2019) was an American sculptor, painter and educator. He had a long career in art education and has many sculptures on public display, but he may be best known for &quot;That Which Might Have Been&quot;—his memorial to the four girls killed in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.

==Early life==
Waddell was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1921 and moved to Evanston, Illinois, at the age of ten. There he began to study art at the Katherine Lord Studio, and by the age of 16 was teaching classes there. In 1939, he graduated from Evanston Township High School and moved to Chicago where he attended the School of the Art Institute.

In 1942, Waddell married his first wife, Elizabeth Owen, and they had three children: Sean Owen, Seamus, and Seanchan Waddell. Elizabeth and John divorced in 1948. At the time, he was working at Buick Aviation Plant, Melrose Park, Illinois—as America had entered World War II.

Waddell&#x27;s education was interrupted by a stint in the US Army 1943-1945. Serving as Private First Class during the War, one of his contributions was as a muralist of hope. On the GI Bill, Waddell returned to the School of the Art Institute. He earned two Master&#x27;s Degrees there and later an Honorary Doctorate from the National College of Education, Chicago (now known as National Louis University).

It was at the Art Institute that Waddell met artist Ruth Holland. In 1949, they were married in a small ceremony with friends and fellow students, Leon Golub and Nancy Spero, as witnesses. Through the decades Ruth appeared in many of his paintings and sculptures. Waddell also became a primary muse in Ruth&#x27;s work. They remained married until Waddell&#x27;s death in 2019 and had two additional sons and a daughter: Lindsey and William Waddell and filmmaker Amy Waddell, respectively.

==Career==
Waddell began having one-man shows of his artwork as early as 1942. He had dozens of such shows over the course of six decades as a professional artist.

His career as an art educator began in earnest in 1947 when he started teaching evening adult classes in the Central YMCA Adult Education Program in Chicago, which he did until 1955. Overlapping with this position was the teaching of art and art education at the National College of Education—from 1949 to 1955. He assumed the position of head of art education at the IIT Institute of Design in 1955. While in Chicago, Waddell designed a program for students with Down&#x27;s Syndrome and varied mental and physical challenges at Bruno Bettelheim’s Orthogenic School.

In 1957, Waddell moved his family to Arizona and became head of Art Education at Arizona State College (later known as Arizona State University). He retired from ASU in 1964 to devote all of his energies to his artwork.

In 2007, several life-sized bronze sculptures by Waddell were stolen, probably due to the value of the metal after the work has been melted.

==Death==
Waddell died November 27, 2019, at the age of 98.

<doc id="1133400" wikidata="Q464932" url="?curid=1133400" title="Jaya Bachchan">
<text>Jaya Bachchan (&quot;née&quot; Bhaduri; born 9 April 1948) is an Indian actress and politician. She is serving as member of the parliament in the Rajya Sabha from the Samajwadi Party since 2004. Having worked in Hindi films and Bengali films, she is noted for reinforcing a natural style of acting in both mainstream and arthouse cinema. A recipient of several accolades, she has won eight Filmfare Awards and the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian honour awarded by the Government of India.

Bachchan made her film debut as a teenager in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;Mahanagar&quot; (1963), followed by her first screen role as an adult in the drama &quot;Guddi&quot; (1971), directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, in their first of several collaborations. She was noted for her performances in films like &quot;Uphaar&quot; (1971), &quot;Koshish&quot; (1972) and &quot;Kora Kagaz&quot; (1974). She starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in several films, including &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973), &quot;Abhimaan&quot; (1973), &quot;Chupke Chupke&quot; (1975), &quot;Mili&quot; (1975) and the cult film &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), which saw her playing the much-lauded role of a young widow. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for &quot;Abhimaan&quot;, &quot;Kora Kagaz&quot; and &quot;Nauker&quot; (1979).

Following her marriage to actor Amitabh Bachchan and the birth of their children, she restricted her work in films, notably starring in Yash Chopra&#x27;s musical romantic drama &quot;Silsila&quot; (1981). After a 17-year sabbatical, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani&#x27;s independent drama &quot;Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa&quot; (1998). Bachchan won three Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actress for playing emotionally-troubled mothers in the commercially successful dramas &quot;Fiza&quot; (2000), &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001) and &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (2003). After another hiatus, she made her comeback with Karan Johar&#x27;s romantic comedy family-drama &quot;Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani&quot; (2023), which earned her a fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

== Early life ==
Jaya Bhaduri was born in a Bengali family on 9 April 1948. She is the daughter of Tarun Kumar Bhaduri, a journalist, author, and poet and his wife, Indira. She studied at St Joseph&#x27;s Convent School, Bhopal and graduated from Film and Television Institute of India in Pune.

== Acting career ==

Bachchan first starred in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s Bengali film, &quot;Mahanagar&quot; (1963) at the age of 14, with Anil Chatterjee and Madhabi Mukherjee. She then appeared in two more Bengali films: a 13-minute short &quot;Suman&quot;, and the comedy &quot;Dhanyee Meye&quot; (1971), where she played the role of Uttam Kumar&#x27;s sister-in-law.

Inspired by her experience with Ray, she joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune and graduated with a gold medal. Hrishikesh Mukherjee cast her in &quot;Guddi&quot; (1971), to play the eponymous role of a petite school-girl obsessed with film star Dharmendra. &quot;Guddi&quot; was a commercial success, and created the girl-next-door image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. While she did venture out to play glamorous roles as in &quot;Jawani Diwani&quot;, (1972) and a semi-negative character of an amnesia-faking heroine in &quot;Anamika&quot; (1973), she was most recognised for her roles epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of &quot;middle-cinema&quot; directors such as Gulzar, Basu Chatterjee and Mukherjee. These films include &quot;Uphaar&quot; (1971), &quot;Piya Ka Ghar&quot; (1972), &quot;Parichay&quot; (1972), &quot;Koshish&quot; (1972) and &quot;Bawarchi&quot; (1972). They also made her a superstar.

In Gulzar&#x27;s &quot;Koshish&quot;, Bhaduri and Sanjeev Kumar played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as disabled people. She described the film as &quot;a learning experience&quot; which motivated her to do social work in future.

She first acted with Amitabh Bachchan in &quot;Bansi Birju&quot; (1972), followed by B. R. Ishara&#x27;s &quot;Ek Nazar&quot; also in the same year. When Amitabh had faced a string of flops and most lead heroines refused to work with him in the Salim–Javed scripted &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973), she agreed to step in. The film turned out to be a big hit creating Bachchan&#x27;s angry-young-man image. All their successive films as a pair were huge hits – &quot;Abhimaan&quot; (1973), &quot;Chupke Chupke&quot; (1975), &quot;Mili&quot; (1975) and &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975).

Her daughter Shweta was born around the time Jaya and Amitabh were working on &quot;Sholay&quot;. Following this, she retired from films and focused on raising her children, making an exception for Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Silsila&quot; (1981), once again opposite her husband. During the late 1980s, she wrote the story for &quot;Shahenshah&quot; (1988), which starred her husband in the lead.

=== Comeback and intermittent work (1998–present) ===
After a gap of 17 years, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani&#x27;s &quot;Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa&quot; (1998), a film about the Naxalite movement. Her performance in the film earned critical acclaim, and earned her a second Filmfare Special Award.

In 2000, she starred alongside Karisma Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan in the crime drama &quot;Fiza&quot; as a mother longing for her son&#x27;s return who goes missing during the 1993 Bombay riots. The film received critical acclaim upon release, with particular praise directed towards Bachchan&#x27;s performance. Sanjeev Bariana of &quot;The Tribune&quot; opined that &quot;Bachchan delivers a commendable performance, displaying mixed emotions through trying times delicately.&quot;, while &quot;Screen&quot; film critic Chaya Unnikrishnan noted that &quot;Bachchan looks every bit a Muslim woman and etches out her character superbly.&quot; Moreover, it emerged as a commercial success at the box-office, grossing worldwide. &quot;Fiza&quot; earned Bachchan her first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

She then starred in Karan Johar&#x27;s ensemble family drama &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001) with her husband and in Nikhil Advani&#x27;s romantic comedy drama &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (2003), playing Preity Zinta&#x27;s mother, Jennifer Kapur, both of which also earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She starred with her son Abhishek in &quot;Laaga Chunari Mein Daag&quot; (2007) and &quot;Drona&quot; (2008).

In 2011, she appeared in the Bangladeshi film &quot;Meherjaan&quot; starring Victor Banerjee and Humayun Faridi. The film is based on a Bangladesh-Pakistan love story in the backdrop of the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities. In 2023, she starred alongside Dharmendra and Shabana Azmi in Karan Johar&#x27;s romantic comedy family drama &quot;Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani&quot;, which emerged as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; noted, &quot;Bachchan is electrifying. Her commanding presence, authoritative attitude and cold stares – this is a stand-out act that&#x27;s sure to be talked about by moviegoers.&quot; Her performance in the film earned her a fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

== Personal life ==

Jaya married actor Amitabh Bachchan, on 3 June 1973. The couple has two children: Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan, who is also an actor.

=== &quot;Drona&quot; speech controversy ===
Bachchan&#x27;s speech during the musical launch of &quot;Drona&quot; in 2008 was criticised by some sections of politicians in Maharashtra. In response to the film&#x27;s director, Goldie Behl, making his introductory speech in English, she said in Hindi, &quot;Hum UP ke log hain, isliye Hindi mein baat karenge, Maharashtra ke log maaf kijiye&quot;. (Translation: &quot;We are people from UP, so we will speak in Hindi. People of Maharashtra, please forgive us.&quot;) Subsequently, she encouraged actress Priyanka Chopra to speak in Hindi.

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray commented that she had no business referring to all the people of Maharashtra in her statement. He threatened to ban all of her films unless she apologised in a public forum for hurting the sentiments of Maharashtrians. MNS workers began to attack theatres screening &quot;The Last Lear&quot;, which starred her husband. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut also criticised her statement, &quot;After making all your success and fortune in Mumbai, if you feel like saying that we are from UP, it&#x27;s very unfortunate&quot;. Amitabh tendered an apology for her statement on her behalf.

Bachchan was first elected in 2004 as the Member of Parliament from the Samajwadi Party, representing Uttar Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha till March 2006.

<text>The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear is a BBC television documentary series by Adam Curtis. It mainly consists of archive footage, with Curtis narrating. The series was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom in 2004. It has subsequently been aired in multiple countries and shown at various film festivals, including the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.

The film compares the rise of the neoconservative movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetrated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.

&quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; was praised by film critics in Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from conservatives and progressives.

== Synopsis ==

=== Part 1. &quot;Baby It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; ===
The first part of the series explains the origins of Islamism and neoconservatism. It shows Egyptian civil servant Sayyid Qutb, depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thinking, visiting the U.S. to learn about its education system, then becoming disgusted at what he judged as the corruption of morals and virtues in western society through individualism. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by westernisation under Gamal Abdel Nasser and becomes convinced that in order to save his own society, it must be completely restructured along the lines of Islamic law while still using western technology. He then becomes convinced that his vision can only be accomplished through use of an elite &quot;vanguard&quot; to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and, after being tortured in one of Nasser&#x27;s jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can be justifiably killed to remove their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he influences Ayman al-Zawahiri, the future mentor of Osama bin Laden, to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the 1979 Iranian revolution, Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981 in the hopes of starting their own revolution. However, the revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that a majority of Muslims have been corrupted, not only by their western-inspired leaders, but Muslims themselves have been affected by jahiliyyah and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they refuse to join his cause. They continued to believe that a vanguard was necessary to rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime and replace it with a &#x27;pure&#x27; Islamist state.

At the same time in the United States, a group of disillusioned liberals, including Irving Kristol and Paul Wolfowitz, look to the political thinking of Leo Strauss after the perceived failure of President Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Great Society&quot;. They conclude that an emphasis on individual liberty was the undoing of Johnson&#x27;s plans. They envisioned restructuring America by uniting the American people against a common evil, and set about creating a mythical enemy. These factions, the neoconservatives, came to power during the 1980s under the Reagan administration, with their allies Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. They alleged that the Soviet Union was not following the terms of a disarmament treaty between the two countries, and together with the outcomes of &quot;Team B&quot;, they built a case using dubious evidence and methods to prove it to Ronald Reagan.

=== Part 2. &quot;The Phantom Victory&quot; ===
In the second part, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich Saudi acolyte Osama bin Laden, join the neoconservative-influenced Reagan administration to combat the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan. When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the Eastern Bloc begins to collapse in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the Soviet Union&#x27;s demise. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe they have the power to create &#x27;pure&#x27; Islamic states in Egypt and Algeria. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism to scare the people into rising up against their leaders. But the people are terrified by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way to hang on to power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims.

In America, neoconservative aspirations to use the United States&#x27; military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.

=== Part 3. &quot;The Shadows in the Cave&quot; ===

The final part addresses the actual rise of al-Qaeda. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent on independent operatives to carry out their new call for jihad. However, the film argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden &quot;in absentia&quot; for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, Jamal al-Fadl, and pay him to testify that bin Laden is the head of a massive terrorist organisation called &quot;al-Qaeda&quot;. With the September 11 attacks, neoconservatives in the new Republican administration of George W. Bush use this invented concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new enemy, culminating in the launch of the War on Terror.

After the American invasion of Afghanistan fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist sleeper cells in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror to a war on general perceived evils with the invasion of Iraq. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where Tony Blair uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new moral authority. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay, many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance without actual investigation on the part of the United States military, and other forms of &quot;preemption&quot; against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved had the potential to become a threat. Curtis specifically attempts to allay fears of a dirty bomb attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others have no foundation in reality. He says, &quot;In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power.&quot;

== Content ==

Adam Curtis originally intended to make a film about conflict within the conservative movement between the ideologies of neoconservative &quot;elitism&quot; and the more individualist libertarian factions. During his research into the conservative movement, Curtis discovered what he saw as similarities in the origins of the neoconservative and Islamist ideologies. The topic of the planned documentary shifted to these other two ideologies, with the libertarian element eventually being phased out. Curtis first pitched the idea of a documentary on conservative ideology in 2003 and spent half a year researching the film. Final recordings were made on 10 October, 19 October and 1 November 2004.

As with many of Curtis&#x27;s films, &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; uses a montage of stock footage taken from the BBC archives which Curtis narrates. Curtis has credited James Mossman as the inspiration for his montage technique, which he first employed for the 1992 series &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, while his use of humour has been credited to his first work with television as a talent-scout for the magazine programme &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; Curtis has also compared the entertainment aspect of his films to the Fox News channel in America, claiming that the network is successful because of &quot;[their viewers] really enjoying what they&#x27;re doing.&quot;

To help drive his points, Curtis uses interviews with various political and intellectual figures. In the first two parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former &quot;American Spectator&quot; writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of &quot;Al-Qaeda: Casting a Shadow of Terror&quot;, comments in &quot;The Shadows in the Cave&quot; on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film&#x27;s narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film&#x27;s subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought&#x27;s Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack includes at least two pieces of music from the films of John Carpenter, who Curtis credited as inspiration for his soundtrack arrangement techniques, as well as tracks from Brian Eno&#x27;s &quot;Another Green World&quot;. There is also music by composers Charles Ives and Ennio Morricone, while Curtis has credited the industrial band Skinny Puppy for the &quot;best&quot; music in the films.

== Airings and distribution ==

&quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; was first broadcast in three parts on BBC Two in 2004 in the United Kingdom, beginning with &#x27;Baby it&#x27;s Cold Outside&#x27; on 20 October, &#x27;The Phantom Victory&#x27; on 27 October, and &#x27;The Shadows in the Cave&#x27; on 3 November. The murder of Kenneth Bigley led the BBC to cease publicising the final episode prior to its airing. It was broadcast again over three days in January 2005, with the third part updated to note the Law Lords ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial was illegal.

In May 2005, the film was screened in a 2½ hour edit at the Cannes Film Festival. Pathé purchased distribution rights for this cut of the film.

By 2008, the film had yet to be aired in the United States. Curtis has remarked on this failure,

Although the series has never been shown on U.S. television, its three parts were shown on 26 February 2005 as part of the True/False Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri, with a personal appearance made by Curtis. It has also been featured at the 2006 Seattle International Film Festival and the San Francisco International Film Festival, the latter awarding Curtis their Persistence of Vision Award. The film was also screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, and there was a brief theatrical run in New York City in 2005.

The film was first aired by CBC in Canada in April 2005, and again in July 2006. The Australian channel SBS had originally planned to air the series in July 2005, but it was cancelled, reportedly in light of the London bombings of 7 July. It was ultimately aired in December, followed by Peter Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The New Al-Qaeda&quot; under the billing of a counter-argument to Curtis.

In April 2005, Curtis expressed interest in releasing an official DVD because of popular demand, but noted that his montage technique created serious legal problems with getting such a release approved. An unofficial DVD release was made in the quarterly DVD magazine &quot;Wholphin&quot; over three issues.

== Reaction ==

=== Critical reaction ===

&quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; received generally favourable reviews from critics. &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; reported that 88% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, with an average score of 8.1/10, based upon a sample of 8 reviews. At &quot;Metacritic&quot;, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 78, based on six reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the film as &quot;a fluid cinematic essay, rooted in painstakingly assembled evidence, that heightens and cleanses your perceptions&quot; while &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a superb, eye-opening and often absurdly funny deconstruction of the myths and realities of global terrorism.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; had an equally enthusiastic view of the film and likened it to &quot;a brilliant piece in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; that&#x27;s (thankfully) come to cinematic life.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; had a more skeptical review, unimpressed by efforts to compare attacks on Bill Clinton by American conservatives with Islamist revolutionary activities, claiming (in a review by literary and film critic A. O. Scott) that, &quot;its understanding of politics, geo- and national, can seem curiously thin.&quot; In May 2005, Adam Curtis was quoted as saying that 94% of e-mails to the BBC in response to the film were supportive.

The film won a BAFTA Award in the category of Best Factual Series in 2005. Other awards were given by the Director&#x27;s Guild of Great Britain and the Royal Television Society.

===Political reaction===
Progressive observers were particularly pleased with the film. Common Dreams had a highly positive response to the film, comparing it to the &quot;red pill&quot; of the &quot;Matrix&quot; series, a comparison Curtis appreciated. Commentary in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was also mostly favorable, noting, &quot;As partisan filmmaking, it is often brilliant and sometimes hilarious – a superior version of &quot;Syriana&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Nation&quot;, while offering a detailed critique on the film&#x27;s content, said of the film itself &quot;[it] is arguably the most important film about the &#x27;war on terrorism&#x27; since the events of September 11.&quot;

Among conservative and neoconservative critics in the United States, &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; has been described as &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, anti-American or both. David Asman of FoxNews.com said, &quot;We wish we didn&#x27;t have to keep presenting examples of how the European media have become obsessively anti-American. But they keep pushing the barrier, now to the point of absurdity.&quot; His views were shared by commentator Clive Davis, ending his commentary on the film for &quot;National Review&quot; by saying, &quot;British producers, hooked on Chomskyite visions of &#x27;Amerika&#x27; as the fount of all evil, are clearly not interested in even beginning to dig for the truth.&quot; Other commentators have variously described the film as pushing a conspiracy theory. Davis and British commentator David Aaronovitch both explicitly labelled the film&#x27;s message as a conspiracy theory, with the latter saying of Curtis &quot;his argument is as subtle as a house-brick.&quot; Attacks in this vein continued after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, with the Christian Broadcasting Network referencing the film as a source for claims by the &quot;British left&quot; that &quot;the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud&quot;, and the Australia Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council calling it &quot;the loopiest, most extreme anti-war documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC.&quot; In &quot;The Shadows in the Cave&quot;, Curtis emphasises that he does not discount the possibility of any terrorist activity taking place, but that the threat of terrorism had been greatly exaggerated. He responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory by saying he believes the alleged use of fear as a force in politics is not the result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film &quot;have stumbled on it.&quot;

Peter Bergen, writing for &quot;The Nation&quot;, offered a detailed critique of the film. Bergen wrote that even if al-Qaeda is not as organised as the Bush administration stressed, it is still a very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. On Curtis&#x27;s claim that al-Qaeda was a creation of neoconservative politicians, Bergen said, &quot;This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks.&quot; Bergen further claimed that Curtis&#x27;s arguments serve as a defence of Bush&#x27;s failure to capture bin Laden in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and his ignoring warnings of a terrorist attack prior to 11 September.

Additional issues have been raised over Curtis&#x27;s depiction of the neoconservatives. Davis&#x27;s article in &quot;National Review&quot; showed his displeasure with Curtis&#x27;s depiction of Leo Strauss, claiming, &quot;In Curtis&#x27;s world, it is Strauss, not Osama bin Laden, who is the real evil genius.&quot; Peter Bergen claimed the film exaggerated the influence of Strauss over neoconservatism, crediting the political philosophy more to Albert Wohlstetter. A 2005 review on Christopher Null&#x27;s Filmcritic.com took issue with Curtis&#x27;s retelling of the attacks on Bill Clinton in &#x27;The Phantom Victory&#x27;, crediting these more to the American religious right than the &quot;bookish university types&quot; of the neoconservative movement.

Daniel Pipes, a conservative American political commentator and son of Richard Pipes who was interviewed in the film, wrote that the film dismisses the threat posed by Communism to the United States as, in Pipes&#x27; words, &quot;only a scattering of countries that had harmless Communist parties, who could in no way threaten America.&quot; Pipes noted that the film adopts this conclusion without mentioning the Comintern, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Klaus Fuchs or Igor Gouzenko.

Allegations have been made of omissions in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss&#x27;s ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film&#x27;s failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.

=== Comparisons to &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; ===
After its release, &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; received multiple comparisons to &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, American filmmaker Michael Moore&#x27;s 2004 critique of the first four years of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency of the United States. The &quot;Village Voice&quot; directly named &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; as, &quot;the most widely discussed docu agitprop since &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; both gave comments lauding Curtis&#x27;s film as superior to &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; and other political documentaries in various fields; the former cited Curtis&#x27;s work as being more &quot;intellectually engaging&quot; and &quot;historically probing&quot;, while the latter cited &quot;balance, broad-mindedness and sense of historical perspective.&quot; Moore&#x27;s work has also been used as a point of comparison by conservative critics of Curtis.

Curtis has attempted to distinguish his work from Moore&#x27;s film, describing Moore as &quot;a political agitprop film-maker,&quot; arguing that, &quot;you&#x27;d be hard pushed to tell my politics from watching [&quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot;].&quot;

<doc id="1133408" wikidata="Q7230228" url="?curid=1133408" title="Pornography laws by region">
<text>Definitions and restrictions on pornography vary across jurisdictions. The production, distribution, and possession of pornographic films, photographs, and similar material are activities that are legal in many but not all countries, providing that any specific people featured in the material have consented to being included and are above a certain age. Various other restrictions often apply as well (e.g. to protect those who are mentally handicapped or highly intoxicated). The minimum age requirement for performers is most typically 18 years.

This article excludes material considered child pornography or zoophilic pornography. In most cases the legality of child pornography and the legality of zoophilic pornography are treated as separate issues, and they are usually subject to additional, specialized laws. Specialized laws to address the emerging phenomenon of &quot;deep fake&quot; pornographic content became an active subject of law-making and litigation in the 2020s, although fictional and semi-fictional pornography have existed throughout history.

== Summary of pornography laws ==

This is a summary table of laws and their enforcement by governments. The subsequent sections contain more detail on each of the jurisdictions.

=== Africa ===

=== Asia === 

=== Europe === 


=== North America ===

=== Oceania === 

=== South America ===


== Africa ==

=== Botswana ===
The possession of &quot;indecent and obscene material such as pornographic books, magazines, films, videos, DVDs, Blu-Ray, VHS, and software&quot; is prohibited in Botswana. Possession or import of such material is illegal and punishable by a fine or up to four years imprisonment.

=== Egypt ===
In Egypt, it is illegal to distribute pornography. Possession and access of pornography are not criminalised. Unlike numerous African nations which have no laws against child pornography, Egypt blocks child pornography websites and dealing in child pornography carries a minimum sentence of five years and fines of US$29,000.

=== Eswatini ===

Under the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act, No. 15 or 2018, the publication, viewership, and sharing of pornography is legal in Eswatini only if it passes a three-element test. Pornography is legal if it does not involve any non-consenting persons (including children or those with a significant disability), can be easily traced to its creator, and does not otherwise depict a sexual offense.

=== Ethiopia ===
Distributing or selling pornographic materials is illegal in Ethiopia, and their production in the country is rare. There are no official laws regarding Internet pornography in Ethiopia, making the Internet the only available source of pornography.

=== Morocco ===
In 2004, Morocco introduced severe punishments for promoting pornography.

=== Nigeria ===
Nigeria has no national laws prohibiting pornography, although the public display of graphic sexual material is illegal in Lagos. The country has a small pornography industry which produces exclusively heterosexual pornography, as homosexual activity in Nigeria is illegal. Some Muslim politicians in the national government have proposed a nationwide block on pornographic websites. There is significant piracy of pornography in Nigeria, with pirated pornographic DVDs being sold from roadside stalls in Lagos. Pornography is also sold in Nigerian sex shops and some pornographic magazines are produced in the country, often reproducing pictures from foreign magazines.

The first officially acknowledged hardcore pornographic film produced in Nigeria was &quot;Better Lover Valentine Sex Party&quot;. It was not submitted to the National Film and Video Censors Board for classification and it was immediately banned on the grounds of obscenity and immorality. Internet pornography is widely viewed in Nigeria. In 2015 the monthly average for the number of searches for pornography was 135,000, and in December 2014 and 2015 the proportion of searches for pornography (relative to other searches) was higher in Nigeria than in the United States. In 2013 Nigeria ranked second globally for Internet searches for gay pornography.

=== South Africa ===
Pornography rated X18 is permitted by the law only if sold to persons over the age of 18 in registered stores. It is an offense to host a pornographic web site in South Africa because of the difficulty of age-verification and the requirement that pornography only be distributed from designated, licensed physical premises. It is also unlawful to visually represent bestiality (also rated XX), but not in text descriptions. Supplying violent pornography is an offence in any form, but the law allows the production of pornography that is not prohibited.

Distribution of pornography is regulated by the Films and Publications Act of 1996, which is enforced by the Films and Publications Board.

=== Uganda ===
Pornographic DVDs have in the past been sold on the streets in Uganda. However, an Anti-Pornography Act (popularly known as the &quot;Anti-Miniskirt Law&quot;) was signed into law in 2014 with the stated objectives of defining what constitutes the offence of pornography and establishing a Pornography Control Committee. The committee is responsible for the implementation of the law and for taking measures to detect, prohibit, collect and destroy pornographic materials. The law broadly defines pornography as &quot;any representation of the sexual parts of a person for primarily sexual excitement&quot;. The law says that &quot;a person shall not produce, traffic in, publish, broadcast, procure, import, export, sell or abet any form of pornography&quot;. Breaches of the law are punishable with up to ten years in jail.

Prior to the passing of the act there were a number of laws concerning aspects of pornography in Uganda, but this was the first law to create a specific offence of pornography. The law repeals and replaces Section 166 of the Penal Code Act, widening the legal interpretation of pornography and prohibiting it comprehensively. The law has been subject to challenge in the Constitutional Court on the basis of its vague wording and the broad powers of the committee.

In July 2018, the Ugandan government directed the country&#x27;s ISPs to block 27 pornographic websites.

== Americas ==
=== Bahamas ===
The Bahamian penal code prohibits the production and distribution of obscene publications. Many types of pornography are prohibited in the Bahamas; however, law enforcement is relaxed and does not usually enforce the prohibition. Pornography is available on Bahamian cable television and in 2014 ZNS-TV broadcast a report on the establishment of a local pornography industry in the Bahamas.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, pornographic film actors must be 18 or older. Pornography which does not involve bestiality is legal when sold in public places. Depiction of sex with non-human animals is legal. However, magazine and DVD covers that depict genitalia must not be visible from public view, and pornography can only be sold to people 18 or older.

=== Canada ===
The laws of Canada permit the sale of hardcore pornography to anyone over the age of 18. While persons below that age may have pornography in their possession, its sale to them is prohibited. Most hardcore pornography is sold in adult stores or on adult websites.

=== Cuba ===
Pornography was illegal in Cuba during Fidel Castro&#x27;s leadership of the country, but the laws were relaxed in the 2010s. Currently, Cuba restricts online pornography.

=== United States ===
In the United States, &quot;non-obscene&quot; pornography is generally lawful at the federal level. Distinguishing between &quot;pornography&quot; and &quot;obscenity&quot; is conducted using the &quot;Miller&quot; test, which was developed in the 1973 case &quot;Miller v. California&quot;. The &quot;Miller&quot; test has three parts:
* Whether &quot;the average person, applying contemporary community standards&quot;, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the interest,
* Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law,
* Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

The following four forms of pornography are specifically unlawful at the federal level.

# Child pornography
#* The commercial production of child pornography was first made unlawful beginning in 1977, but child pornography itself was not made categorically unlawful until 1984.
#* Most of the current penal statutes are codified in chapter 110 of the United States Code.
# Animal crush fetish pornography 
#* Animal crush fetish pornography was first made unlawful in 1999, but that initial law was ruled unconstitutional and revised in 2010.
#* The current penal statute is found at title 18, United States Code, section 48 thereof.
# Video voyeurism pornography
#* Made unlawful in 2004, the current penal statute is found at title 18, United States Code, section 1801 thereof.
# Revenge pornography
#* While the current prohibition carries no civil or criminal penalties, there exists a private right of action for victims.
#* This redress for victims is currently found at title 15, United States Code, section 6851 thereof.

== Asia ==
=== Bangladesh ===
By passing the &quot;Pornography Control Act, 2012&quot;, the government of Bangladesh prohibited the carrying, exchanging, using, selling, marketing, distributing, preserving, filming etc. of pornography (sexually explicit materials, unless it has artistic and/or educational value). Penalties include a maximum of 10 years in prison and fines up to Tk500,000 (US$6,410).

=== China ===

China&#x27;s criminal code defines pornography as

It is illegal to sell, distribute pornography or arrange for pornographic performances in mainland China.

==== Hong Kong ====

Pornographic films in Hong Kong are referred to as Category III films, after the territory&#x27;s motion picture rating system. Prior to 1988 films with excessive nudity, violence, cursing in Chinese and drug use were not allowed to be shown in public theaters. This did not however mean that porn was banned. Porn was and still is legal and easily accessible. In the 80s and 90s before the internet was widespread, it was common to see adult videos for rent in convenience stores and elsewhere. Category III films are not similar to the R-rated films in the United States. Category III spans a wide spectrum from what would be considered &quot;Hard R&quot; all the way to hardcore NC-17 or X rating.

=== India ===
* The selling and distribution of pornographic material is illegal in India under section 294, 295, 296.
* The distribution, sale, or circulation of obscene materials and the selling of pornographic content to any person under age 20 years are illegal under section 293 and IT Act-67B.
* Child pornography is illegal and strictly prohibited across the country under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000.
* The manufacturing, publishing and distribution of pornography is illegal in India under sections 292 and 293.

In July 2015 the Supreme Court of India refused to allow the blocking of pornographic websites and said that watching pornography indoors in the privacy of one&#x27;s own home was not a crime. In August 2015 the Government of India issued an order to Indian ISPs to block at least 857 websites that it considered to be pornographic. In 2015 the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had asked internet service providers to take down 857 websites in a bid to control cyber crime, but after receiving criticism from the authorities it partially rescinded the ban. The ban from the government came after a lawyer filed a petition in the Supreme Court arguing that online pornography encourages sex crimes and rapes.

In October 2018 the government directed Internet service providers to block 827 websites that host pornographic content following an order by the Uttarakhand High Court. The court cited the rape of a 10th standard girl from Dehradun by four of her seniors. The four accused told police that they raped the girl after watching pornography on the Internet.

=== Indonesia ===
A law passed in 2010 states any &quot;pictures, sketches, photos, writing, voice, sound, moving picture, animation, cartoons, conversation, gestures, or other communications shown in public with salacious content or sexual exploitation that violate the moral values of society&quot; will have offenders face up to a 15-year jail sentence. With the maximum penalty for downloading pornographic material is a 4-year jail sentence or a 2 billion rupiah ($219,200) fine.

=== Japan ===
Pornography is legal in Japan; however, there are restrictions. Genitalia must be pixelated or censored under Article 175 of the Criminal Code (1907) and all participants must be 18 years of age or older, unless it is of a fictional characters.

=== Malaysia ===
Pornography is illegal in Malaysia with fines of up to RM10,000 for owning or sharing pornographic materials. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has blocked more than 2,400 pornographic websites between 2018 and 2020.

=== Nepal ===
Nepali law identifies pornography as illegal. The sharing, distribution and broadcasting of pornographic content through any medium is prohibited. In 2010 it was reported that the Home Ministry had banned access to a list of websites including explicitly adult websites. In September 2018, concerns about violence against women led the Government of Nepal to announce its intention to ban online pornography. From 24 September, the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) began to put a block on all websites providing pornographic content on the orders of the Nepal Government Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MOCIT). By 12 October more than 21,000 pornographic websites had been blocked.

=== North Korea ===
Both domestic and imported works of pornography have been available in North Korea since recent decades. Producing, distributing, importing and watching pornography is prohibited.

There is no access to foreign pornographic websites from within North Korea.

=== Pakistan ===

Pornography in Pakistan is illegal and is subject to several legal provisions. Since November 2011 the Government has placed a complete ban on Internet websites containing pornographic material. The list of banned websites is updated on an ongoing basis. Despite this, child pornography is illegal and strictly forbidden in Pakistan and there are severe punishments for possessing or viewing child pornography which include a minimum of 14 years to 20 years in prison and a fine of 1 million Rupees. Pakistan also has cyber unit to curb child pornography within the country. The unit has a team of 40 members and one director-level official, who independently investigate the issue. The unit is integrated with the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).

=== Philippines ===

The Philippine penal code prohibits the production and distribution of obscene publications. Despite this, enforcement is lax. Some local productions of pornography are known to exist in the country.

As of January 14, 2017, several pornography sites, mostly mainstream ones such as Pornhub and XVideos, have been blocked in the Philippines as part of a government crackdown on child pornography. The Philippine government cites Republic Act 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Law as legal justification for the blocks. The list of sites blocked vary depending on the internet service provider enforcing them.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Items considered pornographic by Saudi Arabian standards are forbidden in the country. Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the importation of pornographic items into Saudi Arabia. Such items may be confiscated on arrival and the owner may be subject to a fine.

=== South Korea ===
There is no penalty for viewing or possessing pornography on the Internet in South Korea with the exception of child pornography, for which possession carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison, while distributing, selling or displaying it for commercial purposes carries a maximum sentence of ten years.

Many foreign pornographic websites are blocked, and those found to be operating from within the country are shut down. The Korea Internet Safety Commission is responsible for instructing Internet service providers to block access to &quot;pornography and nudity&quot;. Google Search in South Korea filters search results for around 700 terms considered by the government to be adult in nature unless the user demonstrates that they are aged over 19.

=== Sri Lanka ===

In Sri Lanka, it is illegal to distribute pictorial or video pornography to persons under the age of 14.

=== Syria ===
Pornography is banned in the country. The government has blocked access to around 160 websites.

=== Thailand ===
Possession, production and distribution of pornography for the purposes of trade is illegal in Thailand under section 287 of the Thai Penal Code. The same section also criminalizes participating or assisting in the trade of pornography. A person guilty under this section can be punished with imprisonment not exceeding three years or fined not exceeding THB6,000 or both.

Despite this, pornography is widely available in Thailand and the law remains usually unenforced with the exception of some high-profile cases. On November 3, 2020, The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society announced that it has banned Pornhub, along with 190 other pornographic websites. The ministry stated that the ban was part of the efforts to restrict access to pornography and gambling websites, which remains illegal in Thailand.

=== Turkmenistan ===
A law passed on 1 January 2015 bans access to internet pornography in Turkmenistan.

=== Vietnam ===
Production, distribution, broadcasting, transport, import and advertisement of pornography, is strictly illegal in Vietnam. In 1996 officials became concerned about pornographic films in the country and launched a campaign, with courts awarding fines and prison sentences. Pornography in Vietnam is classed as a &quot;social evil&quot;.

== Europe ==
=== Belarus ===
Production, dissemination and assembly of pornography is illegal under article 343 of the Criminal Code, being punishable with up to four years in prison.

=== France ===

In France, pornography is overall permitted, but with distinctions:
* Hardcore pornography must not be sold to persons under the age of 18.
* Softcore pornography must not be sold to persons under the age of 16.
* Extremely violent or graphic pornography is considered X-rated, and so may be shown only in specific theaters, and may not be displayed to minors.
* Some pornography has a special VAT (value-added tax): a 33% tax is levied on X-rated movies, and a 50% excise is placed on pornographic online services.

The ratings system has caused controversy. For example, in 2000 the sexually explicit and violent film &quot;Baise-moi&quot; was initially rated only as &quot;restricted&quot; by the French government. This classification was overturned by a &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; ruling in a lawsuit brought by associations supporting Christian and family values.

Some movies are forbidden to persons under the age of 18, without the requirement for an X rating, such as &quot;Baise-moi&quot;, &quot;Ken Park&quot; or &quot;Saw 3&quot;, so that these movies can be viewed in theaters and not attract VAT.

=== Germany ===

The constitution and law are very strict about hardcore pornography, especially when compared to very liberal laws about softcore pornography, prostitution and sex shops. Supplying hardcore pornography to people who are less than 18 years old is an offence, and shops selling it must keep people under the age of 18 from entering their premises. If only a part of the shop is dedicated to pornography, it must be completely closed off from the rest of the premises. Alternatively, shops may choose not to display their goods or advertise that they sell them, in which case minors may be admitted. Websites hosting pornographic material within Germany must comply with rules about verifying that viewers are over 18.

Softcore pornography is less restricted, and may even be broadcast on TV at night. The age threshold is usually FSK-16. In contrast many uncut action films or video games easily reach the FSK-18 rating.

=== Hungary ===
Pornography is generally legal in Hungary

In 2021 Hungary&#x27;s parliament passed a law that bans providing pornography that promotes gender reassignment or homosexuality to anyone under 18 years old.

=== Iceland ===
The production or sale of pornography is prohibited in Iceland. Heavy fines were applied in 2001 and ten years earlier a fine was applied to the first manager of the first private TV station (and the only case to present) in Iceland for showing the Danish &quot;mainstream&quot; Zodiac-films, &quot;I Tvillingernes tegn&quot; and &quot;I Tyrens tegn&quot;. In early 2013 there was a draft proposal by Ögmundur Jónasson, the Minister of the Interior, to extend the ban to online pornography to protect children from violent sexual imagery. The plan has been stalled since the change in government during the parliamentary election on 27 April 2013. Since then, there have been no changes to the relevant legislation, and no changes have been formally proposed.

=== Italy ===

In Italy, it is illegal to distribute pictorial or video pornography to persons under the age of 18. However, persons over 18 years of age are permitted to view pornographic material.

=== Netherlands ===

Pornography is legal in the Netherlands.

=== Romania ===
Pornography is legal in Romania since 2003. However, all pornographic sites hosted in the country must be locked with a password, and a tax per minute must be paid by the website owners.

=== Russia ===
According to Russian law, consumption of pornography is allowed though the production of it is not. The illegal production, distribution, and &quot;public demonstration&quot; of pornography is punishable by a 2- to 6-year prison term. Roskomnadzor, the Russian government&#x27;s media overseer, has the power to order the blocking of pornographic websites. In 2015 the agency required the blocking of the Russian-language version of Pornhub and 10 other pornographic sites on the basis of a court ruling.

There is nevertheless some uncertainty concerning the legal status of pornography in Russia. The law criminalizes only the &#x27;illegal&#x27; production and selling of pornography (which implies that it sometimes can be legal), but two issues make enforcement of the law difficult: there is no legal definition of pornography, and there is no law defining when production or selling is permitted.

=== Ukraine ===
Pornographic production, distribution, broadcasting (both audio and video), transportation, import and advertisement is forbidden by law in Ukraine.

=== United Kingdom ===
The main legislation on pornographic materials is the Obscene Publications Act 1959, the Obscene Publications Act 1964, the Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981, and the Video Recordings Act 1984. Video-oriented depictions of hardcore pornographic material (with certain exceptions for works considered primarily &quot;artistic&quot; rather than pornographic) were banned until 1999, when the removal of trade barriers with other European Union member states allowed for the relatively free movement of such goods for personal use.

Under terms set out in the Video Recordings Act 1984, all forms of pornographic material released on either DVD or video formats, within the United Kingdom must, as with all works released on such formats, first be classified by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).

In addition to this, under criminal law, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (in England and Wales), the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 (in Scotland), and the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (in Northern Ireland) each make it a criminal offence for an adult to display pornographic material to a minor (defined under all three acts as a person under the age of 16).

The British Board of Film Classification can, as with all works, issue compulsory cuts to pornographic material (generally when such material is in breach of either the Video Recordings Act 1984, the Obscene Publications Act 1959, and the Obscene Publications Act 1964, with current interpretation of such acts being incorporated into the guidelines which the BBFC as a whole, operate under). Without such cuts issued works can be refused classification (therefore barring the sale of such a work on DVD or video formats within the United Kingdom).

In 2008, the Crown Prosecution Service unsuccessfully prosecuted a man under the Obscene Publications Act (the &quot;R v Walker&quot; trial) for a textual story on a pornography website involving Girls Aloud. Also that year, the Home Office introduced legislation to criminalize possession of what it has labelled extreme pornography; these laws are now contained in sections 63 to 68 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.

== Oceania ==
=== American Samoa ===
Pornography is illegal in American Samoa and is punishable by a fine of up to $USD5,000.

=== Australia ===

In Australia, it is legal to possess pornographic material, with some extreme exceptions. However, it is illegal to sell, exhibit or rent X-rated pornographic material in all states (Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, and Queensland) but it is legal to do so in the two territories (the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory). As the Australian constitution prohibits states from regulating interstate commerce, it is permitted to purchase pornography in either territory and then bring it interstate. As a result, the majority of Australian mail-order operations for adult material operate from the ACT.

In 2007, the Northern Territory National Emergency Response introduced by the Howard government made the possession of RC and X18+ pornography an offence in some Aboriginal communities.

Some types of pornography (both real and fictitious) are technically illegal in Australia and if classified would be rated RC and therefore banned in Australia. This includes any pornography depicting violent BDSM, incest, paedophilia, bestiality, certain extreme fetishes (such as golden showers) and/or indicators of youth (such as wearing a school uniform).

=== Fiji ===
There is no law prohibiting the accessing of online adult pornography in Fiji.

=== Nauru ===
Pornography, including online pornography, is illegal in Nauru and pornographic websites are blocked.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, pornography is generally treated in a liberal manner and very little is banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. However, the most extreme forms of pornography (such as child pornography, rape, necrophilia, bestiality, urophilia and coprophilia) are classified as objectionable material by the Office of Film and Literature Classification, effectively banning them. Indecency laws still criminalise some acts under the Crimes Act 1961. Pornographic DVDs and magazines that arrive in New Zealand need to be examined by either New Zealand Customs, Department of Internal Affairs, New Zealand Police or the Office of Film and Literature Classification before being given an R18 classification. Internet pornography is also regulated but only if websites are based in New Zealand, in which case they will need consent from Department of Internal Affairs. Possession of any material that has objectionable content (which is illegal in New Zealand) is punishable by up to 10 years in jail and a $50,000 fine, or 14 years in jail for distribution of same.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In Papua New Guinea, the possession, import, export, and sale of pornography are all offenses. Control is strict. According to the government, all websites containing pornography, nudity or depictions of sex are blocked and the government has been blocking such sites since early 2009. Under the law, persons who possess, own, import, export, sell or exhibit pornography to the public are subject to arrest and trial and can face up to six months&#x27; imprisonment and/or a fine up to 50,000 to 100,000 Papua New Guinean kina. In PNG, pornography is subject to legal restraints to publication on grounds of obscenity. Laws relating to pornography in Papua New Guinea are vague. The main legislation used in dealing with cases relating to pornographic nature refer back to the Chapter 262 Criminal Code of Papua New Guinea, Lukautim Pikinini Act 2009, Classification of Publication Censorship Act 1989 and the National ICT Act, 2009. Improper Use of ICT Services.

=== Samoa ===
In 2021, a court ruled that online pornography should be blocked by Samoa&#x27;s two major service providers, Digicel and Vodafone.

=== Tonga ===
Under the &quot;Pornography Control Act 2002&quot;, pornography is illegal and punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, three years in prison or both.

=== Vanuatu ===
Production of pornography is illegal in Vanuatu.

<doc id="1133419" wikidata="Q2745509" url="?curid=1133419" title="Opposition to pornography">
<text>Reasons for opposition to pornography include religious objections, feminist concerns, moral reasons as well as alleged harmful effects, such as pornography addiction and erectile dysfunction. Pornography addiction is not a condition recognized by the DSM-5, the ICD-11, or the DSM-5-TR. Anti-pornography movements have allied disparate social activists in opposition to pornography, from social conservatives to harm reduction advocates. The definition of &quot;pornography&quot; varies between countries and movements, and many make distinctions between pornography, which they oppose, and erotica, which they consider acceptable. Sometimes opposition will deem certain forms of pornography more or less harmful, while others draw no such distinctions.

A 2018 Gallup survey reported that 43% of U.S. adults believe that pornography is &quot;morally acceptable&quot;, a 7% increase from 2017. From 1975 to 2012, the gender gap in pornography opposition has widened, with women remaining more opposed to pornography than men, and men&#x27;s opposition has declined faster.

==Religious views==
Most world religions have positions in opposition to pornography from a variety of rationales, including concerns about modesty, human dignity, chastity and other virtues. There are numerous verses in the Bible which are cited as condemning pornography or adultery, notably for Christians, Matthew 5:28 in the Sermon on the Mount which states &quot;that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&quot;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church explicitly condemns pornography because it &quot;offends against chastity&quot; and &quot;does grave injury to the dignity of its participants&quot; since &quot;each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others&quot;.

Islam also forbids adultery, and various verses of the Quran have been cited as condemning pornography, including Quran 24:31 which tells men to &quot;restrain their eyes&quot; from looking sexually at women.

==Feminist views==
Some feminists are opposed to pornography, arguing that it is an industry which exploits women and is complicit in violence against women, both in its production (where they present evidence that abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (where pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment). They charge that pornography contributes to the male-centered objectification of women and thus to sexism. Andrea Dworkin was a feminist famously opposed to the pornography industry, and proposed the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance in several American cities in the 1980s. In 2015, feminist Gail Dines founded Culture Reframed, which responds to the growing pornography industry by providing education and support for healthy child and youth development.

However, many other feminists are opposed to censorship, and have argued against the introduction of anti-porn legislation in the United States, among them Betty Friedan, Kate Millett, Karen DeCrow, Wendy Kaminer and Jamaica Kincaid. Some sex-positive feminists actively support pornography that depicts female sexuality in a positive way, without objectifying or demeaning women, whereas some other feminists don&#x27;t see any problem with the industry in its current state, given the subjective nature of perceiving humiliation or aggressiveness in a consensual context as something demeaning or negative.

==Conservative views==
Religious conservatives commonly oppose pornography, along with a subset of feminists, though their reasoning may differ. Many religious conservatives view pornography as a threat to children. Some conservative Catholics and Protestants oppose pornography because they believe that it encourages non-procreative sex, encourages abortion, and can be connected to the rise of sexually transmitted diseases.

Concerned Women For America (CWA) is a conservative organization that opposes same-sex marriage and abortion. When discussing violence against women, the CWA often uses pornography to illustrate their points. The CWA asserts that pornography is a major reason why men inflict harm on women. The CWA argues that pornography convinces men to disrespect their wives and neglect their marriages, thereby threatening the sanctity of traditional marriage. Unlike other issues CWA has tackled, they are less forcefully anti-feminist when it comes to the topic of pornography, as many of their points surrounding why pornography is distasteful parallels those of anti-pornography feminists.

Some extremist Christian and far-right groups have issued death threats towards porn managers and sex workers.

==Scientific-based views==

Dolf Zillmann argued in the 1986 publication &quot;Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography&quot; that extensive viewing of pornographic material produces many unfavorable political effects, including a decreased respect for long-term monogamous relationships, and an attenuated desire for procreation. He describes the theoretical basis of these experimental findings:The values expressed in pornography clash so obviously with the family concept, and they potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children... Pornographic scripts dwell on sexual engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way attached or committed to each other, and who will part shortly, never to meet again... Sexual gratification in pornography is not a function of emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities, curtailments, and costs...

A study by Zillman in 1982 also indicated that prolonged exposure to pornography desensitized both men and women toward victims of sexual violence. After being shown pornographic movies, test subjects were asked to judge an appropriate punishment for a rapist. The test subjects recommended incarceration terms that were significantly more lenient than those recommended by control subjects who had not watched pornography.

Some researchers like Zillman believe that pornography causes unequivocal harm to society by increasing rates of sexual assault. Other researchers believe that there is a correlation between pornography and a decrease of sex crimes; exhibiting a strong disbelief in the claim that pornography is a cause of rape; mainstream science does not claim that pornography would be a cause of rape.

The appropriation of the sexually explicit in American culture is part of what has been called &quot;the pornification of America&quot;.

In a 2021 review of recent pornography research, K. Camille Hoagland &amp; Joshua B. Grubbs posit that &quot;Specifically, mere pornography use itself was most often not associated with sexual functioning in either direction, but self-reported problematic use of pornography was consistently associated with more sexual functioning problems.&quot;

The impact of pornography can vary significantly among teenagers and across cultures, depending on specific constellations of personality traits. Research indicates that special attention may be required for highly frequent consumers of pornography, those who actively seek sexually violent content, and individuals with additional risk factors.

Male adolescents at a more advanced pubertal stage, characterized as sensation seekers with weak or troubled family relations, tended to use pornography more frequently. This usage correlated with more permissive sexual attitudes and stronger gender-stereotypical sexual beliefs. Additionally, it appeared to be associated with engaging in sexual intercourse, having greater experience with casual sex behavior, and an increased likelihood of involvement in sexual aggression, both as perpetrators and victims. The authors of the review state that the impact of pornography upon the brains of teenagers is a suggestion (what scientific literature suggests) rather than a scientific fact.

Rape culture is often discussed when it comes to pornography, and is defined by society victim-blaming women because of their rape. It is known as society making rape less substantial. Some of the most searched titles on pornography websites is rape scenes.

In 2016, model and actress Pamela Anderson and Orthodox Rabbi Shmuley Boteach co-authored a viral &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opinion piece, in which they called online pornography a &quot;public hazard of unprecedented seriousness.&quot; The two called for a &quot;sensual revolution&quot; to replace &quot;pornography with eroticism, the alloying of sex with love, of physicality with personality, of the body&#x27;s mechanics with imagination, of orgasmic release with binding relationships.&quot; They later gave a joint lecture at Oxford University to over 1,000 people. The two also wrote a book together, &quot;Lust for Love&quot; (2018), about how meaningful, passionate sex has been declining, and calling for a new sensual revolution that emphasizes partners connecting in the bedroom.

Some studies suggest that children and youths are more susceptible to the neurological effects of pornography consumption than adults, however this lacks direct empirical evidence. This can be attributed to considerable ethical problems with performing such research. Since those problems are a huge obstacle, it is likely that such research will not be allowed, thus possibly it could never be known. Rory Reid (UCLA) declared &quot;Universities don&#x27;t want their name on the front page of a newspaper for an unethical study exposing minors to porn.&quot; Repeated cross-sectional surveys did not detect any correlation between pornography use and mental problems of teenagers, since the curve is U-shaped, with both too low and too high consumption of pornography being problematic.

While the World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-11 (2022) has recognized compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (CSBD) as an &quot;impulsive control disorder&quot;, CSBD is not an addiction, and the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s DSM-5 (2013) and the DSM-5-TR (2022) do not classify compulsive pornography consumption as a mental disorder or a behavioral addiction. According to Emily F. Rothman, &quot;The professional public health community is not behind the recent push to declare pornography a public health crisis.&quot; The ideas supporting the &quot;crisis&quot; have been described as pseudoscientific.

<doc id="1133421" wikidata="Q2218582" url="?curid=1133421" title="Samuel Lister, 1st Baron Masham">
<text>Samuel Cunliffe Lister, 1st Baron Masham (1 January 1815 – 2 February 1906), was an English inventor and industrialist, notable for inventing the Lister nip comb.

==Early life==
He was born in Calverley Hall (now Calverley House Farm- not to be confused with the medieval manor of the same name), near Bradford, the son of Ellis Cunliffe Lister (1774–1853), the first Member of Parliament elected for Bradford after the Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 45), and Mary (née Kay) Lister. In 1854 he married Anne Dearden, daughter of John Dearden; they had five daughters. He started his working life working for a Liverpool firm of merchants.

==Industry and enterprise==

Lister went on to play a key role in the development of Bradford&#x27;s wool industry during the nineteenth century Industrial Revolution. The textile industry transformed Bradford from a small rural town into a rich and famous city. As well as being a successful mill owner he occasionally diverged to other subjects, such as an air brake for railways. He was fond of outdoor sports, especially coursing and shooting, and was a keen patron of the fine arts.

In 1838 he and his elder brother John started as worsted spinners and manufacturers in a new mill which their father built for them at Manningham. Lister&#x27;s Mill (otherwise known as Manningham Mills), and its owner, were particularly well known in the district. The business eventually made Lister one of Bradford&#x27;s most famous fathers, a multi-millionaire and the provider of thousands of jobs in the city. Lister&#x27;s Mill changed the identity of the region, and its economy. Lister himself came to epitomise Victorian enterprise. However it has been suggested that his capitalist attitude made trade unions necessary.

== Textiles ==

Lister invented the Lister nip comb which separated and straightened raw wool, which has to be done before it can be spun into worsted yarn, and in the nineteenth century it was a hot, dirty and tiring job. By inventing the nip comb, Lister revolutionised the industry.

Around 1855 he began work to find a way of utilising the fibre contained in silk waste. The task occupied his time for many years and brought him to the verge of bankruptcy, but at last he succeeded in perfecting silk-combing appliances which enabled him to make good quality yarn at a low cost. Another important invention in connection with silk manufacture was a velvet loom patent that he bought in 1867 to the Catalan inventor Jacint Barrau. The new loom was built at Manningham Mills by Jaume Reixach, Barrau&#x27;s foreman and Lister&#x27;s Mill director afterwards, and made him very rich. However, the business was seriously affected by the prohibitory duties imposed by the United States, making him an early critic of the British policy of free trade.

== Honours ==

In 1887 he was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire.

In 1891 he was made a peer; he took his title from the little Yorkshire town of Masham, close to which is Swinton Park, purchased by him in 1888. In 1898, Lister was awarded the freedom of the City of Bradford.

He died at Swinton Park on 2 February 1906, and was succeeded by his son, Samuel Cunliffe Lister, 2nd Baron Masham.

== Lister Park ==

A statue of him now stands in Lister Park, in Manningham, Bradford, West Yorkshire, sculpted by Matthew Noble from a block of white Sicilian marble and unveiled on Saturday 15 May 1875 by W. E. Forster, then Member of Parliament for Bradford. Lister Park was donated to the people of Bradford by Lister.

<doc id="1133425" wikidata="Q3641980" url="?curid=1133425" title="Bombette">
<text>Bombette (; singular &quot;bombetta&quot;) are fresh pork meat rolls usually stuffed with cheese, salt and pepper, traditionally spread all over Apulia and prepared in the whole territory of Valle d&#x27;Itria (in particular Martina Franca, Cisternino and Locorotondo, as well as spread in most of the provinces of Taranto and Brindisi with recipes varying from place to place).

== Name origin ==
The literal translation of &quot;bombette&quot; is &quot;little bombs&quot;.

The name refers to the rounded shape and small size of these rolls, as well as to their filling which creates a real &quot;explosion&quot; of flavour.

== Preparation ==
Bombette are prepared with selected slices of pork capocollo (coppa); the slices of meat are placed on a cutting board and usually stuffed with Apulian canestrato cheese, salt and pepper, then rolled up and closed manually until creating a real &quot;bundle&quot;, sometimes parsley is added. The rolls thus obtained can be cooked on the grill or even in the oven.

== Variants ==
There are many variations of this speciality, whose recipes are often jealously and secretly guarded by individual butchers, originating a wide variety of bombette made by the &quot;house&quot;. Among the most common ones there are some without any filling, simply seasoned with salt and pepper, or some others wrapped with a slice of bacon, some containing ham instead of minced meat or others with a spicy filling often called &quot;Mexican bombette&quot;.

<doc id="1133433" wikidata="Q428535" url="?curid=1133433" title="Malik Rose">
<text>Malik Jabari Rose (born November 23, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player. Rose played 13 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning championships with the San Antonio Spurs in 1999 and 2003.

==Early life and education==
Rose was born on November 23, 1974, in Philadelphia. He attended and graduated from Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, the same high school as Wilt Chamberlain. He graduated from Drexel University with All-American honors after leading the Dragons to their lone NCAA Tournament victory with an upset of the University of Memphis 75–63. At Drexel, Malik averaged over 16 points and 12 rebounds per game throughout his four-year college career. He was a student teacher at Robert E. Lamberton School and Albert M. Greenfield Elementary. In 2011, the 1995-96 men&#x27;s basketball team, led by Rose, was inducted into the Drexel athletic Hall of Fame.

==NBA career==
Rose was drafted in 1996 in the second round by the Charlotte Hornets. Rose is the second Drexel basketball player to participate in the NBA, following Michael Anderson. He was signed as a free agent by the San Antonio Spurs in 1997, and quickly became one of their more popular players due to his displays of hustle, defense, and skill despite being undersized. Rose was on the Spurs&#x27; NBA championship teams in 1999 and 2003. On February 24, 2005, Rose was traded along with a pair of first-round draft picks to the New York Knicks for Nazr Mohammed and Jamison Brewer, much to the dismay of Spurs fans. A highlight during his tenure with the Knicks was a 10-point, 15-rebound and 9-assist performance in a 94–93 win over the Charlotte Bobcats on April 18, 2007, just missing a triple-double. After being relegated to a minor supporting role for the Knicks for four years, Rose was traded from the Knicks to the Oklahoma City Thunder on February 19, 2009, for Chris Wilcox.

One of Rose&#x27;s most memorable games occurred during the opening round of the 2002 Playoffs against the Seattle SuperSonics. With star front court players Tim Duncan and David Robinson out, Rose stepped in as a starter. Bringing the Spurs back from a 26-point half-time deficit, the Spurs eventually lost by 12 but not before making a contest of the game. Malik had 28 points and 13 rebounds for the game.

==Post-NBA career==

The Oklahoma City Thunder renounced the rights to Rose on December 22, 2009.

Rose joined the Madison Square Garden Network as a pregame analyst for his former Knicks team for the 2009–2010 season. He was also named the color analyst for the NBA Development League team, the Austin Toros, who broadcast their games on television for the first time.

On December 20, 2011, Rose was hired as color commentator for the Philadelphia 76ers television broadcasts. Rose served in this role from 2011 to 2015. On November 15, 2014, Rose made his first appearance for NBA TV. Rose made appearances on NBATV during the 2014–15 season on days when it did not conflict with his 76ers schedule.

On August 12, 2015, Rose was hired as manager of basketball operations for the Atlanta Hawks. On April 11, 2017, Rose was promoted to the general manager of the Erie BayHawks, the Hawks&#x27; affiliate in the NBA G League. He was named the G League&#x27;s Basketball Executive of the Year in his only season with the organization.

In 2018, Rose was hired as an assistant general manager within the Detroit Pistons&#x27; organization and left the BayHawks.

In the summer of 2020, Rose stepped down from the Pistons front office to take on a job with the NBA front office as vice president of basketball operations. Rose would be named Head of Basketball Operations for the NBA G-League on January 5, 2022 

Outside of basketball, Rose has been involved in the San Antonio community with his charity work and the San Antonio staple &#x27;Malik&#x27;s Philly&#x27;s Phamous&#x27; restaurant, specializing in Philadelphia&#x27;s beloved cheesesteak sandwiches &amp; specialty fries.

<doc id="1133436" wikidata="Q370315" url="?curid=1133436" title="2003 Major League Soccer season">
<text>The 2003 Major League Soccer season was the eighth season of Major League Soccer. It was also the 91st season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer in the United States, and the 25th with a national first-division league.

The Los Angeles Galaxy moved into the league&#x27;s second soccer-specific stadium when the Home Depot Center opened on June 1, 2003. The Chicago Fire continued to play at Cardinal Stadium in Naperville but returned to the newly renovated Soldier Field for their final regular season game.

The number of games was increased to 30 after a reduction to 28 for the 2002 season. Instead of a best-of-three series, the playoffs were tweaked so that the conference semifinals would be determined by a home-and-away aggregate score over two matches. Additionally, the two conference finals became one match fixtures instead of two legs.

The regular season began on April 5, and concluded on October 26. The 2003 MLS Cup Playoffs began on November 1, and concluded with MLS Cup 2003 on November 23. The San Jose Earthquakes won their second MLS Cup in three years with a victory over Chicago.

==Overview==

===Season format===
The season began on April 5 and concluded with MLS Cup on November 23. The 10 teams were split evenly into two conferences. Each team played 30 games that were evenly divided between home and away. Each team played every other team in their conference, and two designated opponents from the opposite conference, four times, and the remaining teams in the opposite conference twice.

The top four teams from each conference qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs. In the first round, aggregate goals over two matches determined the winners. The conference finals were played as a single match, and the winners advanced to MLS Cup. In all rounds, draws were broken with two 15-minute periods of extra time, followed by penalty kicks if necessary. The away goals rule was not used in any round.

The team with the most points in the regular season was awarded the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield. Additionally, the winner of MLS Cup and the runner-up qualified for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

<doc id="1133451" wikidata="Q5534189" url="?curid=1133451" title="Geoff Jenkins">
<text>Geoffrey Scott Jenkins (born July 21, 1974) is an American former professional baseball outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers (1998–2007) and Philadelphia Phillies (2008). He is fourth on the Brewers’ all-time career home run list, trailing only Hall-of-Famer Robin Yount, 2011 National League (NL) MVP Ryan Braun, and former All-Star first baseman Prince Fielder. Following his playing career, Jenkins was on the coaching staff of the 2013 Peoria Explorers of the now-defunct Independent Freedom Pro Baseball League.

==Amateur career==
Jenkins attended Cordova High School in Rancho Cordova, California, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He was selected for the all-state baseball team as a junior and senior before graduating in 1992.

Jenkins enrolled at the University of Southern California (USC) and played college baseball for the USC Trojans from 1993 to 1995. In his final season, he batted .399 with 78 runs batted in (RBIs) and a .748 slugging percentage in 70 games, also scoring 75 runs to tie the school record held by Rich Dauer and Mark McGwire; his 23 home runs and 193 total bases ranked second in school history behind McGwire&#x27;s 1984 totals of 32 and 216. He led the Trojans to the College World Series, where they reached the championship game; Jenkins was named to the all-CWS team, and also earned team co-MVP honors and was named a consensus All-American. In 1996, the year of the CWS&#x27; 50th tournament, Jenkins was named to the all-decade team for the 1990s. He finished his USC career with a .369 batting average, 45 home runs (second only to McGwire&#x27;s 54), a .652 slugging percentage, 180 runs, and school records for runs batted in (175) and total bases (444).

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues===
Jenkins was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round (9th overall) in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft. He spent the 1995–1997 seasons within the Milwaukee farm system, and began the 1998 season in the minor leagues.

===Milwaukee Brewers===

Jenkins made his major league debut on April 24, 1998, and he singled off Orel Hershiser in his first career plate appearance and hit a fifth-inning home run off Hershiser in his third career plate appearance. On September 23 of that same year, in the midst of a tense Wild Card race, Jenkins hit the routine fly ball that Brant Brown of the Chicago Cubs dropped allowing three runs to score and the Brewers to win. Jenkins would go on to bat over .300 in his 2nd and 3rd seasons, driving in 90 or more runs three times for one of the perennially weaker teams in the league.

In , he was the Brewers&#x27; team MVP. He led the Brewers in batting average (.303) and home runs (34). His season was cut short when on June 17 in a game against the Houston Astros he suffered a horrific-looking dislocated ankle when sliding into third base feet first during a game. He was safe on the play. He was selected to the National League&#x27;s All-Star team in via the MLB&#x27;s All-Star Final Vote contest where a player is selected from both leagues by fans to join their respective team after the initial roster is announced.

On June 8, , he became the 8th player in Major League history to strike out six times in a single game. After playing in left field for virtually his entire career, he moved to right field for the and seasons when Milwaukee acquired Carlos Lee.

In 2006, Jenkins experienced a prolonged offensive slump, struggling in particular against left-handed pitching. In August 2006, the Brewers benched Jenkins, one of their highest-paid players at the time, in favor of the younger Corey Hart.

In 2007, Jenkins returned to left field to platoon with Kevin Mench. On October 30, 2007, the Brewers officially declined their $9 million option on Jenkins&#x27; contract, making him a free agent for the season.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
On December 20, 2007, Jenkins signed a two-year, $13 million deal with a vesting option for 2010 with the Philadelphia Phillies. He returned to Miller Park in a Phillies uniform on April 23, 2008, to a crowd of just over 30,000. Jenkins was welcomed back with a tribute video, highlighting his ten-year career with the Brewers, and the standing ovation that followed. He received a second ovation while leading off the second inning. Philadelphia would go on to lose the game, 5–4. Jenkins went 0 for 3, with a walk and a stolen base. In the postseason, his only hit came on a leadoff double in the bottom of the 6th inning of Game 5 of the 2008 World Series. Jenkins‘ hit set the tone for the finale of the World Series as the Phillies won the World Series and earned Jenkins the first and only World Series ring of his 11-year career.

Jenkins was released by the Phillies at the end of spring training on March 31, .

===Retirement===
On July 9, 2010, Jenkins retired from baseball as a Milwaukee Brewer.
==After baseball==
Jenkins has been a franchise partner in Phoenix-area F45 Training Centers since March 2, 2019.

<doc id="1133469" wikidata="Q1756243" url="?curid=1133469" title="Golden Feelings">
<text>Golden Feelings is the debut studio album by American musician Beck, released in 1993 by Sonic Enemy. The album showcases his roots in the anti-folk scene.

== Release ==
The album was initially available only in limited quantities on cassette, Sonic Enemy remastered the album and re-released it on CD in 1999. Beck was upset that they did so without his permission, and after he made his displeasure known, Sonic Enemy ceased to press any more copies. Only 2,000 were made, causing the CD to become quite valuable.

A few of the tracks on this album would appear on later releases, specifically &quot;No Money No Honey&quot; on his second studio album &quot;Stereopathetic Soulmanure&quot;, &quot;Mutherfukka&quot; on his third studio album &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; (renamed to &quot;Mutherfucker&quot;), &quot;Super Golden Black Sunchild&quot; and &quot;Special People&quot; as a B-side to the 1994 single &quot;Pay No Mind (Snoozer)&quot;, and &quot;Trouble All My Days&quot; also as a B-side to &quot;Pay No Mind (Snoozer)&quot;, 1995 single &quot;Devils Haircut&quot; and later on the deluxe edition of that singles album, &quot;Odelay&quot;.

==Reception==

AllMusic described the album as &quot;an extremely interesting, entertaining, and humorous document that proves that from the start Beck had his heart set on making experimentation his only gimmick.&quot; &quot;UDiscoverMusic&quot; wrote that the album had varisped vocals and backward tapes, that &quot;battle with cut-and-pasted audio scraps, weird, dissonant effects and deranged screams, in an oddly involving and darkly humorous excursion to Dystopia&quot;. They also wrote that &quot;Golden Feelings&quot; was anarchic and &quot;sometimes not entirely listenable&quot;, but that &quot;the contents of that lowest of lo-fi cassettes were nonetheless compelling&quot;.

Aaron Paskin of &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot; described the album as a &quot;filthy, largely abrasive but fascinating document of the anti-folk movement and the beginnings of one of the most illustrious careers in music history&quot;, planting the seeds of what would eventually become lyrics on his third studio album &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;. They also stated that frequently, the &quot;music here is unhinged and abstract&quot;, highlighting this fact with specific tracks &quot;No Money No Honey&quot;, &quot;Mutherfukka&quot;, and &quot;Schmoozer&quot;. Overall, they state that the album is an intriguing listen despite being unpleasant, being an &quot;essential document for both anti-folk history and the roots of one of the most stylistically versatile and prolific artists ever.&quot;

In a ranking of every Beck album, Maura Johnston of &quot;Vulture&quot; placed the album in last, stating that while the occasional &quot;grappling-hook-strong riff bubbles up&quot;, there&#x27;s so much else going on that finding these isn&#x27;t &quot;all that appealing a prospect.&quot; The eighth track, &quot;Heartland Feeling&quot;, which remains Beck&#x27;s third longest song behind &quot;Bonus Noise&quot; and &quot;The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton&quot;, was ranked as the 28th best Beck song by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Another ranking of Beck&#x27;s records by &quot;Diffuser&quot; stated that while a time capsule to his early, more experimental work, is also &quot;borderline unlistenable&quot;. Specific examples included Beck&#x27;s distorted vocals and the layers of &quot;intentionally obnoxious noise&quot;, even with that, they still note that some of the lyrics on this hint at &quot;what&#x27;s to come&quot;.

<doc id="1133472" wikidata="Q6198969" url="?curid=1133472" title="Jim Wilson (Ontario politician)">
<text>Jim Wilson (born April 4, 1963) is a retired Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the riding of Simcoe—Grey, and its predecessor riding of Simcoe West, from 1990 to 2022. He sat as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario caucus from his first election until November 2, 2018, when he resigned from caucus due to allegations of sexual misconduct. While part of the PC caucus, Wilson was chosen by his fellow caucus members on July 2, 2014, to serve as interim leader of the party and Leader of the Opposition following the resignation of Tim Hudak. He continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition until September 2015 when new party leader, Patrick Brown, entered the legislature through a by-election. He was reelected in June 2018, but resigned from cabinet and the Progressive Conservative caucus on November 2, 2018. He sat as an independent member for the remainder of the 42nd Parliament of Ontario and did not seek re-election in the 2022 Ontario general election.

==Background==
Wilson was educated at St. Michael&#x27;s College at the University of Toronto where he served as student council president and as a member of the university&#x27;s governing council. During and after his graduation, he worked as an assistant to Ontario Management Board chair George McCague, and subsequently worked for federal cabinet minister Perrin Beatty.

==Politics==

===In opposition===
In the 1990 provincial election, he was elected in Simcoe West by 1940 votes over New Democrat Leo Loserit. The NDP won a majority government in this election, while the Tories won only 20 seats of 130 for third-party status. In September 1991, Wilson was appointed as party Critic for health policy.

===Harris government===
There was a significant swing to the Progressive Conservatives in the 1995 provincial election, and Wilson was re-elected by almost 20,000 votes over his nearest opponent. On June 26, 1995, he was appointed Minister of Health in the government of Mike Harris.

As health minister, Wilson resigned in the wake of allegations that a member of his staff improperly obtained and leaked confidential information about a cardiologist&#x27;s income as part of a bid to discredit a vocal opponent in the continuing dispute over government cutbacks in doctors&#x27; incomes. The personal information leaked was deemed to be without the knowledge of, or at the request of the minister or ministry staff.

In October 1997, Wilson was named as Minister of Energy, Science and Technology.

After redistribution, Wilson ran for re-election in the 1999 provincial election in the new seat of Simcoe—Grey. He defeated his nearest opponent, Liberal Norman Sandberg, by over 19,000 votes.


===Eves Government===
He was retained in the Energy, Science and Technology portfolio until April 2002, when Ernie Eves replaced Mike Harris as Premier. Eves named Wilson as Minister of Northern Development and Mines, and Chair of the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation. On June 17, 2003, he was also named Minister of Environment.


===Opposition (2nd time)===
The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 election, although Wilson retained Simcoe—Grey by a reduced margin. In 2004, he supported John Tory&#x27;s successful bid to replace Eves as party leader. In 2009, he supported Tim Hudak&#x27;s successful bid to replace Tory as party leader.

He was re-elected to the Ontario Legislature on October 10, 2007, defeating his nearest opponent by 11,711 votes. He was re-elected again in the 2011 election for his sixth term defeating his nearest opponent by 14,935 votes. He was re-elected by a slimmer margin in the 2014 provincial election.

Under Hudak, from 2011 to 2014, Wilson served as Opposition House Leader.

====Interim leadership====
Following Hudak&#x27;s resignation, Wilson was chosen interim leader by caucus on July 2, 2014, defeating John Yakabuski and Randy Hillier and served until a leadership election was held in May 2015 which chose Patrick Brown as Hudak&#x27;s permanent successor. In the fall of 2015, Wilson then returned to his role as Opposition House Leader.

===Ford government and resignation from PC caucus===
Wilson was sworn in as Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade when the ministry was formed. Wilson resigned from cabinet and the Progressive Conservative caucus on November 2, 2018. A statement from the Office of the Premier stated that his resignation was to &quot;seek treatment for substance addiction&quot;. Media later reported that Wilson&#x27;s resignation was related to allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The Premier&#x27;s Office initially refused to confirm or deny the reports. However, Premier Doug Ford confirmed on November 7, 2018, that Wilson was asked to resign from caucus in response to allegations of sexual misconduct; Ford further added that his office had initially claimed publicly that Wilson&#x27;s resignation was for substance abuse treatment to protect the complainant.



In September 2020, after having served 30 years in the legislature, Wilson announced that he will not seek re-election.

<text>Griffith Jones (early 1684 – 8 April 1761) was a Welsh minister of the Church of England and a promoter of Methodism. He is best known for spreading literacy in Wales with his circulating schools.

==Family background==
Jones was born in 1683 or 1684 at Penboyr, Carmarthenshire, and christened on 1 May 1684. His father was John Ap Gruffydd, &quot;a godly father&quot;, and his mother Elinor John. Later in life, he married Margaret, who was described as a charitable and pious woman.

==Education==
After village school, Jones became a shepherd, but then entered Carmarthen Grammar School, with the aim of becoming a clergyman. About 1707 he applied for ordination, and according to John Evans of Eglwys Cymyn (1702–1782), was rejected more than once, but owing to the influence of Evan Evans, vicar of Clydeu, Pembrokeshire, he was at last ordained as a priest by Bishop George Bull in 1708.

==Circulating schools==
Jones was appointed in 1716 rector of Llanddowror, where he remained for the rest of his working life. He was an enthusiastic member of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. In 1731, he started what were known as circulating schools, in order to teach people to read. These were held in one location for about three months before moving (&quot;circulating&quot;) to another place in Carmarthenshire. The language of instruction in these schools was the language of the people, Welsh. The idea met with enthusiasm, and by his death in 1761, it is estimated that over 200,000 people had learnt to read in schools organised by Jones throughout the country.

Jones taught people to read that they might know those things that were necessary for their salvation – the curriculum at his schools consisted only in the study of the &quot;Bible&quot; and the catechism of the Church of England. But in doing so he joined in creating a country with a literate population and a deeper knowledge of the Christian scriptures. This may have played a key role in making the people of Wales ready to accept Methodism. He is often thought of as the forerunner of Methodist ideas in Wales. He was a powerful preacher and he would preach in the open air, as later the Methodists would do, and bring upon himself the censure of bishops for addressing irregular meetings. He lent his critical support to the Methodist revival, and was associated with the early leaders.

Daniel Rowland was converted through his preaching.

On 8 April 1761, aged 77, he died at the home of Bridget Bevan in Laugharne, where he had resided since his wife&#x27;s death. Bridget Bevan continued to manage and support the schools until she died in 1779. Both were buried in Llanddowror Church.

<doc id="1133484" wikidata="Q4956188" url="?curid=1133484" title="Bramley-Moore Dock">
<text>Bramley-Moore Dock was a dock on the River Mersey in Liverpool, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. The dock is located in the northern dock system in Liverpool&#x27;s Vauxhall area, and was connected to Sandon Half Tide Dock to the north and Nelson Dock to the south. Jesse Hartley was the architect. The dock opened in 1848.

The docks was infilled with Everton FC&#x27;s new home ground, Everton Stadium, being constructed on the dock with a 2025 opening date scheduled. The Club received planning approval for a 52,888 capacity stadium which is set to be opened in time for the start of the 2025/26 football season. The project was cited as one of the reasons for the revocation of Liverpool&#x27;s World Heritage Site status as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, with the World Heritage Committee stating that the project was one of the developments which had resulted in a &quot;serious deterioration&quot; of the historic site.

==History==
The dock was opened on 4 August 1848, as part of Jesse Hartley&#x27;s major northern expansion scheme of that year, and was named after and opened by John Bramley-Moore, chairman of the dock committee at the time. When built, Bramley-Moore Dock was the most northerly part of the dock system. At the time, access to the River Mersey was from the south, through the new Nelson and Salisbury Docks, which were all commissioned simultaneously. When built, Bramley-Moore Dock was used for the largest steamships of the era.

In 1851, further docks were opened to the north. These included Wellington Half Tide Dock, which gave a second access point for Bramley-Moore into the Mersey. The berthing of the larger ships was moved to the new Sandon Dock and Huskisson Dock within a few years of opening because of the ease of access to the river these docks offered. Around 1900, the Wellington Dock and the adjoining Sandon Dock were realigned, with the half tide dock separated as Sandon Half Tide Dock, as it remains today.

Although a mixed-use dock, with one of the original transit sheds still in place, Bramley-Moore did extensive coal trade. The coal handling included both coal for export and bunker coal for steamships in the port, transported from the South Lancashire Coalfield. A high-level railway opened in 1857 to transport coal directly to the north quay. The high-level railway was connected by viaduct to the adjacent Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway line. The high-level railway was operational from 1856 to 1966.

After the decline in coal-fired steamships, the dock continued to export coal. Following the demise of coal mining in South Lancashire, and most of the UK, the export market for coal dissolved with the dock ceasing coal exports in 1988.
Bramley-Moore Dock is the location of one of Liverpool&#x27;s brick-built hydraulic accumulator towers. The Grade II listed tower is in severe disrepair with Everton&#x27;s plans for a new stadium including the commitment to invest in heritage and repair and restore the tower for public use. The tower provided hydraulic power to dock gates and lifting equipment but is no longer active.
== Future of the dock ==

In 2007, the Peel Group, owners of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, unveiled the £5.5 billion Liverpool Waters regeneration programme. Bramley-Moore Dock is encompassed in the site.

Bramley-Moore Dock is the most northern of the docks within the former Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City World Heritage Site and the planned Liverpool Waters and the most southerly of the working docks. The hydraulic tower and dock retaining walls are Grade II listed buildings. Bramley-Moore Dock may have been listed as World Heritage Site but sits behind locked gates, semi-derelict with no access to the public, its heritage assets are decaying and is next door to a waste water treatment plant.

On 23 March 2017 it was announced that an agreement had been reached between Liverpool City Council, Everton F.C. and Peel Holdings to acquire the dock for a new football stadium. A planning application was submitted on 23 December 2019, with approval granted by the city council on 23 February 2021.

On 23 February 2021 Everton Football Club were given planning permission to develop a 52,888 capacity stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock. The planning committee voted unanimously in favour of the plans and spoke passionately about how the public benefits would far outweigh any heritage impact on the site.

Everton&#x27;s plans would deliver a £1.3bn boost to the economy, create more than 15,000 jobs, attract more than 1.4m visitors and act as a catalyst for £650m of accelerated regeneration.

At the planning meeting Everton also committed to investing up to £55m to repair, preserve, restore and open up Bramley-Moore Dock&#x27;s heritage assets.

In July 2021, the developments on the dock were stated as reasons for the revocation of Liverpool&#x27;s World Heritage site status.

On 10 August 2021, ground was broken on the project.

On 14 August 2023, a worker died following an incident at the site.

On 3 January 2025, it was reported that the stadium will open its doors for the first time at a test event involving 10,000 fans that will feature Everton&#x27;s U-18s side. The first test match was an under-18s friendly between Everton and Wigan on 17 February; 10,000 fans -who got tickets in a ballot- watched the game.

<text>Whac-A-Mole is an arcade game. It was created in 1975 by the amusements manufacturer TOGO in Japan, where it was originally known as or .

A typical &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; machine consists of a waist-level cabinet with a play area and display screen, and a large, soft mallet. Five to eight holes in the play area top are filled with small, plastic, cartoonish moles, or other characters, which pop up at random. Points are scored by, as the name suggests, whacking each mole as it appears. The faster the reaction, the higher the score.

==Play==

The cabinet has a three-digit readout of the current player&#x27;s score and, on later models, a &quot;best score of the day&quot; readout. The mallet is usually attached to the game by a rope to prevent it from being lost or stolen.

Current versions of &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; include three displays for Bonus Score, High Score, and the current game score. Home versions, distributed by Bob&#x27;s Space Racers, have one display with the current score.

If the player does not strike a mole within a certain time or with enough force, it eventually sinks back into its hole with no score. Although gameplay starts out slow enough for most people to hit all of the moles that rise, it gradually increases in speed, with each mole spending less time exposed and with more moles exposed at once. After a designated time limit, the game ends, regardless of the player&#x27;s score. The final score is based on the number of moles the player struck.

In addition to the single-player game described above, there is a multi-player game, most often found at amusement parks. In this version, there is a large bank of individual &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; games linked together, and the goal is to be the first player to reach a designated score (rather than hitting the most moles within a certain time). In most versions, striking a mole is worth ten points, and the winner is the first player to reach a score of 150 (15 moles). The winner receives a prize, typically a small stuffed animal, which can be traded up for a larger stuffed animal should the player win again.

Game play options have become more adjustable, allowing the operator/owner to selectively alter the high score, hits points, rate of progressive speed, and game time.

The game is still used for teaching auditory processing and attention.

==History==
&quot;Mogura Taiji&quot; was invented in 1975 by Kazuo Yamada of TOGO, based on ten of the designer&#x27;s pencil sketches from 1974. TOGO released it as &quot;Mogura Taiji&quot; to Japanese amusement arcades in 1975. It became a major commercial success in Japan, where it was the second highest-grossing electro-mechanical arcade game of 1976 and again in 1977, second only to Namco&#x27;s popular arcade racing game in both years. &quot;Mogura Taiji&quot; was licensed to Bandai in 1977. Bandai (now part of Bandai Namco Holdings) introduced the game to the Japanese home market as a toy in 1977, called ; it was a major hit by 1978, selling over 1 million units. In the late 1970s, arcade centers in Japan were flooded with similar, derivative &quot;mole buster&quot; games. &quot;Mogura Taiji&quot; has since been commonly found at Japanese festivals.

&quot;Mogura Taiji&quot; made its North American debut in November 1976 at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) show, where it drew attention for being the first mallet game of its type. Gerald Denton and Donny Anderson saw it and saw great potential for converting it into a carnival game by putting it in a trailer. Denton showed the game to Aaron Fechter and assigned him the task of building their own version of the game. Fechter coined the name &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; and added air cylinders &quot;so that when air pushed up the moles, the air acted as a cushion&quot;. He developed the prototype in 1977, and Denton and Anderson presented it to the founder of Bob&#x27;s Space Racers, Bob Cassata, that year. After Bob made further refinements, Bob&#x27;s Space Racers began selling the game in 1977. In 1978 it debuted at a midway exhibition show, where it was the most popular game. The following year, it debuted at pinball parlours. In 1980, it was sold in the carnival, amusement park and coin-op arcade markets. &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; has since become a popular carnival game.

Back in Japan, Namco, who were beginning to shift towards arcade video game production with hits like &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979) and &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980), noticed arcade centers in Japan were flooded with &quot;mole buster&quot; games. To capitalize on their popularity, Namco began work on a similar game with a unique motif to help it stand out from similar games. &quot;Sweet Licks&quot; (1981) was originally designed by TOGO, who had originally named it &quot;Mole Attack&quot;. Namco purchased the rights to the game and gave it new artwork. &quot;Sweet Licks&quot; was designed by Yukio Ishikawa, a mechanical game designer for Namco. The game was themed around cake and pastries to help attract women. It was the first arcade game to use an LCD monitor to display the player&#x27;s score. &quot;Sweet Licks&quot; became popular in Japan and was subsequently released in North America in April 1982, then in Europe, where it became popular in the 1980s.

==Variations==
The original &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; game inspired the first genre of games with a violent aspect as central to their user experience. Researchers have used &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; and its variations to study the violent aspects of these games.

The &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; game trademark was originally owned by Bob&#x27;s Space Racers but since 2008 has been owned by Mattel. Machines with similar gameplay are sold under other names. &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; has also been the basis for a number of internet games and mobile games that are similar in play and strategy.

Engineer Tim Hunkin built and installed a &quot;Whack a Banker&quot; machine at Southwold Pier in England in 2009 made from parts of a previous &quot;Whack a Warden&quot; machine.

Mattel Television currently is partnered with Fremantle to develop a game show inspired by the game, which has yet to debut. The show will be an elimination-style, unscripted series to determine the &quot;Whac-a-Mole Champion&quot;. The competition will involve a life-size version of the game, as well as obstacle courses and other &quot;surprising twist[s]&quot;.

==Design==
The moles are mounted on rods and raised by a lever and crank system. When the user strikes the mole, a microswitch is activated by a pin housed within the mole and the system lowers the mole.

The timing of the moles was originally controlled by tones from an audio tape which then drove an air cylinder system.

==Colloquial usage==
The term &quot;whac-a-mole&quot; (or &quot;whack-a-mole&quot;) is often used colloquially to refer to a situation characterized by a series of futile, Sisyphean tasks, where the successful completion of one just yields another popping up elsewhere.

In computer programming/debugging it refers to the prospect of fixing a bug causing a new one to appear as a result. In an Internet context, it refers to the challenge of fending off recurring spammers, vandals, pop-up ads, malware, ransomware, and other distractions, annoyances, and harm.

In law enforcement it refers to criminal activity popping up in another part of an area after increased enforcement in one district reduces it there. 

In a military context it refers to ostensibly inferior opposing troops continuing to appear after previous waves have been eliminated. 

It has also been applied to fake news, where as soon as one story is debunked another appears elsewhere – or sooner.

<doc id="1133541" wikidata="Q2535056" url="?curid=1133541" title="Nuclear football">
<text>The nuclear football, officially the Presidential Emergency Satchel, is a briefcase, the contents of which are to be used by the president of the United States to communicate and authorize a nuclear attack while away from fixed command centers, such as the White House Situation Room or the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. Functioning as a mobile hub in the strategic defense system of the United States, the football is carried by a military aide when the president is traveling.

== Name ==
The briefcase is officially named the &quot;Presidential Emergency Satchel&quot;. During the administration of Dwight Eisenhower, the briefcase was most commonly nicknamed the &quot;satchel&quot; or the &quot;black bag.&quot;

By the time of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, if not earlier, the briefcase was also becoming known as the &quot;football.&quot; General Chester Clifton stated in his 1986 interview that the term was used &quot;jokingly&quot;, and he described how warrant officers, who were on a twenty-four hour schedule, would regularly hand-off the briefcase to the next person. That routine could have inspired the football metaphor, which dovetailed with the Kennedy clan&#x27;s penchant for touch football. Various sources claim, often mentioning Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara as a source, that the term &quot;football&quot; was derived from a nuclear attack plan codenamed &quot;Dropkick.&quot; When and where McNamara made such a statement has not been cited nor is there an original source for the &quot;Dropkick&quot; reference. That claim may have a fictitious premise because &quot;Dropkick&quot; appears distinctively in the film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; when the character General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) informs President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) that the wayward B-52s headed to the Soviet Union &quot;were part of a special exercise we were holding called Operation Dropkick.&quot;

During 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson discussed with Robert McNamara an arrangement to eliminate the &quot;need for an aide to be in constant attendance upon him.&quot; Word of that proposal began to circulate in the media prompting White House aide Jack Valenti to deny that it had been under consideration. The newspaper article citing the denial, the syndicated &quot;Allen-Scott Report,&quot; is perhaps the earliest public reference to the &quot;football,&quot; quoting Valenti as saying that &quot;The &#x27;black bag&#x27; or &#x27;football&#x27;, as we call it, goes wherever the President travels.&quot;

== Contents ==
In his 1980 book &quot;Breaking Cover&quot;, Bill Gulley, former director of the White House Military Office, wrote:
The president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying the nuclear football with launch codes for nuclear weapons. It has been described both as a metal Zero Halliburton briefcase and as a leather briefcase weighing about , with photographic evidence existing of the latter. A small antenna protrudes from the bag near the handle, suggesting that it also contains communications equipment of some kind.

It is a popular misconception that the football contains a large red button, which when pressed, launches a nuclear attack.

== Operation ==

If the U.S. president, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, decides to order the use of nuclear weapons, the briefcase would be opened. A command signal, or &quot;watch&quot; alert, would be issued to the United States Strategic Command and perhaps the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The president would review the attack options with others such as the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and decide on a plan, which could range from the launch of a single ICBM or nuclear-armed bomber to options for multiple, even hundreds of ICBMs or bombers. These are among the preset war plans developed under OPLAN 8010 (formerly the Single Integrated Operational Plan). A two-person verification procedure would precede the entering of the codes into a Permissive Action Link.

Before the order can be followed by the military, the president must be positively identified using a special code issued on a plastic card, nicknamed the &quot;biscuit&quot;. The authentication is conducted between the president and the National Military Command Center deputy director of operations, using a challenge code of two phonetic letters. The president will read, from the biscuit, the daily phonetic letters, and the deputy director will confirm or deny that it is correct, confirmation indicating the person is the president and the attack orders can be given. Down the chain of command, the United States has a two-man rule in place at nuclear launch facilities. This verification process ensures the order came from the actual president. Many sources indicate that the president has sole launch authority, and the defense secretary has no veto power. A Congressional Research Service provides a detail reason: There is a short time before nuclear weapons from adversaries will strike US soil and a similar short time when advisers relay options to the US President. Back during the Cold War, some analysts argued that a launch under attack was the preeminent option during the Cold War, and that the command and control system was designed to permit such a prompt launch of U.S. nuclear weapons. The time for any US response was noted as thirty minutes. Secondly, the US may conduct a pre-emptive strike if the assessment was its territory or allies were facing an imminent nuclear attack. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will also be an advisor to the President, but is by law only allowed to advise, and has no operational control over US forces. The Secretary of Defense also advises but the Goldwater–Nichols Act Section 162(b) states the chain of command to a unified or specified combatant command runs &quot;from the president to the secretary of defense,&quot; and &quot;from the secretary of defense to the commander of the combatant command&quot;.

However, it has been argued that the president may not have sole authority to initiate a nuclear attack because the defense secretary is required to verify the order but cannot veto it. U.S. law dictates that the attack must be lawful; military officers are required to refuse to execute unlawful orders, such as those that violate international humanitarian law. 

Some military officials, including General John Hyten, have testified to the U.S. Congress that they would refuse to carry out an unlawful order for a nuclear strike. In addition, off-the-shelf strike packages are pre-vetted by lawyers to confirm that they are legal and, thus, such a strike would be presumed to be a lawful order.

Military service members have been reprimanded for questioning U.S. protocols for nuclear strike authority. In 1975, Major Harold Hering was discharged from the Air Force for asking, &quot;How can I know that an order I receive to launch my missiles came from a sane president?&quot; Nevertheless, the president, once in office, as noted by former Defense Secretary William Perry and Tom Z. Collina, retains the sole authority to launch a nuclear strike or attack.

The football is carried by one of the rotating presidential military aides (one from each of the six armed forces service branches), whose work schedule is described by a top-secret rota. This person is a commissioned officer in the U.S. military, pay-grade O-4 or above, who has undergone the nation&#x27;s most rigorous background check (Yankee White). These officers are required to keep the football readily accessible to the president at all times. Consequently, this officer carries the football either standing or walking near the president at all times, including riding on Air Force One, on Marine One, or in the presidential motorcade with the president.

There are three nuclear footballs in total; two are allocated to the president and vice president, with the last being stored in the White House. The practice of also providing an aide with a football to the vice president, to whom command authority would devolve if the president is disabled or deceased, began during the Carter administration. In presidential transitions, the president-elect does not receive the actual nuclear code card until after the nuclear briefing, which usually occurs when &quot;he meets with the outgoing president at the White House just before the actual inauguration ceremony. The code card is activated electronically right after the president-elect takes the oath at noon&quot;.

If the outgoing president is not present at the inauguration — as happened in 2021 when Donald Trump did not attend the inauguration of Joe Biden but stayed in Florida — one football is kept with him and remains active until 11:59:59 a.m. on inauguration day. After that point, the now-former president is denied access to the football, its codes are automatically deactivated, and the aide carrying the football returns to Washington, D.C. In the meantime, the incoming president receives one of the spare footballs at the pre-inauguration nuclear briefing, as well as a &quot;biscuit&quot; with codes that become active at 12:00:00 p.m.

According to military analyst and whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, presidents beginning with Eisenhower have in fact delegated nuclear launch authority to military commanders who may then sub-delegate authority further. In Ellsberg&#x27;s view, the nuclear football is primarily a piece of political theater, a hoax that obscures the real chain of nuclear command and control.

== History ==
The nuclear football dates to the last years of the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, when it became an instrument for White House emergency preparations and presidential control over nuclear weapons. The notion that a designated military aide should accompany a traveling president with a special satchel for such purposes was the creation of White House naval aide Edward L. Beach Jr. On 19 January 1961, the day before his inauguration, president-elect John F. Kennedy received a briefing from President Eisenhower and his staff secretary General Andrew Goodpaster on emergency procedures in a nuclear crisis. Goodpaster described the contents of the &quot;satchel,&quot; which plans for implementing Federal Emergency Plan D-Minus, and a document authorizing nuclear weapons use in a crisis. That was the Joint Chief of Staff Emergency Actions File, which included instructions for U.S. commanders to transfer nuclear weapons to NATO allies and arrangements to enable the president to participate in an emergency telephone conference with the defense secretary and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Goodpaster also showed Kennedy a booklet of instructions for military commanders providing advanced authorization (pre-delegation) for nuclear weapons use in the event that the President had not survived a nuclear attack and communications with Washington, D.C., were cut off.

During his administration, President Kennedy routinized the satchel, which was known as the &quot;black bag&quot;. When the Berlin Crisis raised questions about a possible nuclear emergency in January 1962, Kennedy discussed with White House Naval Aide Tazewell Shepard what procedures would be necessary for making a nuclear response during a military confrontation and how he would direct the Pentagon to do so. Shepard formulated questions that Kennedy could use during a meeting with the Joint Chiefs on methods for communicating and authenticating presidential instructions in a crisis. The questions concerned procedures for contacting the Joint War Room at the Pentagon if the president believed it necessary to &quot;launch an immediate nuclear strike against the Communist Bloc&quot;—for example, If the president used the &quot;red button&quot; on the telephone to contact the War Room, what would he say to make such a request and how would the instructions be verified.

A record of the Kennedy-Joint Chiefs of Staff conference has not been disclosed, but according to National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, one takeaway from the discussion was that the president expected to be able &quot;to initiate, as well as participate in, an emergency conference with the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.&quot; Bundy expected the Pentagon to cooperate by holding practice drills so that that War Room staff could handle a presidential request. Another administrative response may have been the inclusion in the &quot;Black Bag&quot; of a card, later known as the &quot;Biscuit,&quot; with the codes needed to authorize launches of nuclear weapons. According to William Manchester&#x27;s account, by the time of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, the &quot;Black Bag&quot; included such codes, as well as contact details for communicating with the British Prime Minister and the President of France in a nuclear crisis. It also included several dozen Emergency Action Papers, later known as Presidential Emergency Action Documents (PEADs), including proclamations for martial law.

A major component of the &quot;Black Bag&quot; was the &quot;SIOP Execution Handbook,&quot; also known as the &quot;Gold Book,&quot; with details on the Single Integrated Operational Plan attack options available to decision-makers. Kennedy had received several briefings on the SIOP, which acquainted him with its basic features. To protect such sensitive contents, the &quot;Black Bag&quot; was by November 1963 a &quot;thirty-pound metal suitcase with an intricate combination lock.&quot; There was some consideration during 1965 of finding ways to reduce the weight, apparently to no avail because recent accounts describe the weight as .

During the Eisenhower administration, Vice President Richard Nixon had an emergency satchel assigned to him. When Kennedy became president, one of the White House military aides sent a satchel to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, but his office returned it for unexplained reasons. According to JCS Chairman General Maxwell D. Taylor, Johnson knew about the satchel, but never received a briefing on it before he became president. As President Johnson possibly found stressful the presence of the military aide carrying the football, on one trip during his 1964 campaign, the aide flew on a separate plane.
As the football became a routine element of the presidential entourage some information about it appeared. A 1965 &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; article reported on how the launch codes could be transmitted in a crisis and on the systems that were in place at the Pentagon to verify presidential orders. Public officials hosting presidents sometimes noticed an aide carrying the football. When President Richard Nixon attended the ceremonial opening of the Bay Area Rapid Transit in September 1972, his hosts were aware of a &quot;peculiar briefcase&quot; carried by a U.S. Marine officer. Mishaps could occur. At Camp David in 1973, when Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev spontaneously drove off with Nixon in a Lincoln Continental that the President had given him, Nixon was separated from the Secret Service and presumably the bagman. One president may have been unwilling to accommodate the football holder when traveling from the White House. Reportedly, Jimmy Carter refused to let the military aide stay in a trailer at his residence in Plains, Georgia, although Carter later denied the allegation.

When Carter was president, he began to carry the &quot;biscuit&quot; in a jacket pocket. Carter supposedly lost the card in a suit that went to the dry cleaner. The &quot;biscuit&quot; was separated from a severely wounded Ronald Reagan immediately after the 1981 assassination attempt when the George Washington University hospital emergency department trauma team cut into his clothing. It was later discovered lying unsecured in one of his shoes on the emergency department floor. During the incident, Reagan was separated from the rest of the football as well, because the officer who carried it was left behind as the motorcade sped away with the wounded president.

It was reported that President Bill Clinton left his nuclear football aide by leaving a NATO summit meeting in haste.

===Recent times===
As the nuclear football is required to be near the president at all times, the aides carrying it frequently appear in press photographs. In February 2017, a guest at President Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago resort posed for a photo with the military aide carrying the football, posting the image to Facebook and identifying the aide by his first name. The photo was posted while Trump was hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, around the same time as news broke that North Korea had fired a nuclear-capable Pukguksong-2 ballistic missile over the Sea of Japan. U.S. military officials clarified that it was neither illegal nor against proper procedure for the officer to appear in such a photo, although they conceded that the situation was strange.

On November 8, 2017, when President Trump made a state visit to China, U.S. military aides carrying the football were reportedly involved in a &quot;short scuffle&quot; with Chinese security officials, after the latter tried to bar the former access to the Great Hall of the People auditorium. Political correspondent Jonathan Swan, who reported the incident, wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m told that at no point did the Chinese have the nuclear football in their possession or even touch the briefcase. I&#x27;m also told the head of the Chinese security detail apologised to the Americans afterwards for the misunderstanding.&quot;

On January 6, 2021, during the storming of the United States Capitol by rioters, security footage, displayed during the subsequent Trump impeachment trial, showed Vice President Mike Pence along with the aide carrying the backup football being hastily evacuated from the Senate chamber. While the vice president was sheltering with his team and family, the football came within of the approaching rioters. Its capture during the event could have resulted in the loss of sensitive intelligence surrounding pre-planned nuclear strike options. It was later reported that military officials were unaware of the danger to the football during the riot.

Following President Trump&#x27;s failure to secure a second term, he did not attend President Biden&#x27;s inauguration, when the football is normally handed over. Instead, Trump&#x27;s football remained with him while a second one accompanied Biden. At the noon EST transition time, the codes in the footballs accompanying Trump and Pence (who did attend the inauguration) were deactivated, and those in Biden&#x27;s and incoming Vice President Kamala Harris&#x27;s were activated.

In February 2021, a group of 31 Congress members signed a letter requesting that President Biden give up sole authority to use the nuclear launch codes. The letter asked Biden &quot;to install checks [and] balances in our nuclear command-and-control structure&quot; and proposed alternatives to the existing structure.

The 1986 Goldwater–Nichols Act streamlined the military chain of command, which now runs from the president through the secretary of defense directly to combatant commanders (CCDRs, all four-star generals or admirals), bypassing the service chiefs. The service chiefs were assigned to an advisory role to the president and the secretary of defense and given the responsibility for training and equipping personnel in the unified combatant commands.

She has written fifty books, including two novels, seven cookbooks and culinary memoirs, more than twenty children&#x27;s books, a biography, and a collection of poetry. In addition, she has written for magazines including &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;Lear&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;The Horn Book&quot;.

<text>Town &amp; Country, formerly the Home Journal and The National Press, is a monthly American lifestyle magazine. It is the oldest continually published general interest magazine in the United States.

==History==

===Early history===
The magazine was founded as &quot;The National Press&quot; by poet and essayist Nathaniel Parker Willis and &quot;New York Evening Mirror&quot; newspaper editor George Pope Morris in 1846. Eight months later, it was renamed &quot;The Home Journal&quot;. After 1901, the magazine&#x27;s name became &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, and it has retained that name ever since.

Throughout most of the 19th century, this weekly magazine featured poetry, essays, and fiction. As more influential people began reading it, the magazine began to include society news and gossip in its pages. After 1901, the magazine continued to chronicle the social events and leisure activities of the North American upper class, including debutante or cotillion balls, and also reported on the subsequent &quot;advantageous marriages&quot; that came from people meeting at such social engagements.

The magazine&#x27;s earlier readership consisted of members of the Establishment. This included older wealthy families of New York City, Boston Brahmins and, later, those people in other parts of the United States whose surnames may have appeared in the &quot;Social Register&quot; (established 1887).

Willis owned and edited the magazine from 1846 until his death in 1867.

===Modern history===
After Willis&#x27;s death, the magazine went through several owners and editors until William Randolph Hearst acquired ownership in 1925. The first editor under Hearst ownership was Harry Bull. He edited the magazine from 1925 through 1949. Henry B. Sell became Bull&#x27;s successor.

The magazine is still owned and published by the Hearst Corporation. It is published monthly, and its readership is composed of mainly younger socialites, café society, and middle class professionals.

Most of the advertising copy in the magazine is for luxury goods and services. The feature articles and photography focus primarily on fashion, arts, culture, interior design, travel, weddings, parties, gala events and other interests and concerns of the upper class.

In May 1993, Pamela Fiori became the first woman editor-in-chief of &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; magazine. During her tenure, Fiori was credited with increasing circulation by making the magazine more fashion forward and in recent years, making philanthropy more of a priority for the magazine.

Fiori also pushed for more diversity in the magazine&#x27;s coverage. In an effort to play down the magazine&#x27;s perceived snobbish and elitist WASP, or preppy image, more celebrities have been showing up on the magazine&#x27;s covers, and there has been an increase in the number of articles showcasing the events and weddings of socially prominent black people, as well as the social activities of people of other ethnicities.

On April 6, 2010, Fiori was replaced by Steven Drucker as the editor-in-chief of the magazine. Jay Fielden was named editor-in-chief in 2011. Fielden was previously editor-in-chief of &quot;Men&#x27;s Vogue.&quot; Earlier in his career, he had worked at &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He said his goal was to bring &quot;a lot of people under the tent&quot; of &quot;a snooty, exclusionary magazine.&quot; He later said, &quot;I gave &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; some teeth, reporting on behavior that wasn&#x27;t always that which, well, Emily Post would approve, like having an evening toke instead of a Scotch on the rocks.&quot; In 2014, Fielden convinced novelist Jay McInerney to move his column about wine from the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; to &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;.

Fielden inaugurated the T&amp;C 50 lists, including rankings of philanthropists and influential American families. In 2014, he founded the &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; Philanthropy Summit, which has featured speakers such as Michael Bloomberg, Chelsea Clinton, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bradley Cooper, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Geoffrey Canada. Fielden left &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; in 2016, when he replaced David M. Granger as editor-in-chief of Esquire Magazine. &quot;Adweek&quot; wrote that Fielden had transformed the magazine from &quot;dusty publication to buzzy brand.&quot;

According to &quot;HuffPost&quot; on May 9, 2018, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; took criticism for disinviting Monica Lewinsky from its philanthropic summit because former President Bill Clinton decided to attend the event. Hollywood producer Judd Apatow commented, &quot;This is what everyone is fighting against.&quot; He then added that &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; &quot;should be ashamed of themselves.&quot;

===Spin-off===
In September 2003, a spin-off magazine entitled, &quot;Town &amp; Country Travel&quot;, appeared. It is published quarterly. In September 2007, &quot;Town &amp; Country Travel&quot; launched a travel website and a staff travel blog. There is a special edition of the magazine focusing on wedding planning. In the past decade, the magazine has also published several etiquette, wedding and lifestyle guidebooks. Among the most recent books published by the magazine is &quot;Modern Manners: The Thinking Person&#x27;s Guide to Social Graces,&quot; released in 2005 and edited by &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; senior editor Thomas Farley.

In 2003, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; released &quot;Town &amp; Country Weddings&quot;, which is published twice yearly.

The first international version of the magazine, called &quot;Town &amp; Country Philippines&quot;, was launched by Summit Media in 2007.

A British &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; magazine was launched by Hearst Magazines UK, a subsidiary of Hearst Corporation, in May 2014.

<text>&lt;/math&gt;

In geometry, the snub disphenoid is a convex polyhedron with 12 equilateral triangles as its faces. It is an example of deltahedron and Johnson solid. It can be constructed in different approaches. This shape is also called Siamese dodecahedron, triangular dodecahedron, trigonal dodecahedron, or dodecadeltahedron.

The snub disphenoid can be visualized as an atom cluster surrounding a central atom, that is the dodecahedral molecular geometry. Its vertices may be placed in a sphere and can also be used as a minimum possible Lennard-Jones potential among all eight-sphere clusters. The dual polyhedron of the snub disphenoid is the elongated gyrobifastigium.

== Construction ==
The snub disphenoid can be constructed in different ways. As suggested by the name, the snub disphenoid is constructed from a tetragonal disphenoid by cutting all the edges from its faces, and adding equilateral triangles (the light blue colors in the following image) that are twisted in a certain angle between them. This process construction is known as snubification.
The snub disphenoid may also be constructed from a triangular bipyramid, by cutting its two edges along the apices. These apices can be pushed toward each other resulting in the new two vertices pushed away. Alternatively, the snub disphenoid can be constructed from pentagonal bipyramid by cutting the two edges along that connecting the base of the bipyramid and then inserting two equilateral triangles between them. Another way to construct the snub disphenoid is started from the square antiprism, by replacing the two square faces with pairs of equilateral triangles. Another construction of the &quot;snub disphenoid&quot; is as a digonal gyrobianticupola. It has the same topology and symmetry but without equilateral triangles. It has 4 vertices in a square on a center plane as two anticupolae attached with rotational symmetry.

A physical model of the snub disphenoid can be formed by folding a net formed by 12 equilateral triangles (a 12-iamond), shown. An alternative net suggested by John Montroll has fewer concave vertices on its boundary, making it more convenient for origami construction.

The eight vertices of the snub disphenoid may then be given Cartesian coordinates:
formula_2
Here, formula_3 is the positive real solution of the cubic polynomial formula_4. The three variables formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 is the expression of:
formula_8
Because this construction involves the solution to a cubic equation, the snub disphenoid cannot be constructed with a compass and straightedge, unlike the other seven deltahedra.

==Properties==
As a consequence of such constructions, the snub disphenoid has 12 equilateral triangles. A deltahedron is a polyhedron in which all faces are equilateral triangles. There are eight convex deltahedra, one of which is the snub disphenoid. More generally, the convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular polygon are the Johnson solids, and every convex deltahedron is Johnson solid. The snub disphenoid is among them, enumerated as the 84th Johnson solid formula_9. The dual polyhedron of the snub disphenoid is the elongated gyrobifastigium.

=== Measurement ===
A snub disphenoid with edge length formula_10 has a surface area:
formula_11
the area of 12 equilateral triangles. Its volume can be calculated as the formula:
formula_12

=== Symmetry and geodesic ===
The snub disphenoid has the same symmetries as a tetragonal disphenoid, the antiprismatic symmetry formula_13 of order 8: it has an axis of 180° rotational symmetry through the midpoints of its two opposite edges, two perpendicular planes of reflection symmetry through this axis, and four additional symmetry operations given by a reflection perpendicular to the axis followed by a quarter-turn and possibly another reflection parallel to the axis..

Up to symmetries and parallel translation, the snub disphenoid has five types of simple (non-self-crossing) closed geodesics. These are paths on the surface of the polyhedron that avoid the vertices and locally look like the shortest path: they follow straight line segments across each face of the polyhedron that they intersect, and when they cross an edge of the polyhedron they make complementary angles on the two incident faces to the edge. Intuitively, one could stretch a rubber band around the polyhedron along this path and it would stay in place: there is no way to locally change the path and make it shorter. For example, one type of geodesic crosses the two opposite edges of the snub disphenoid at their midpoints (where the symmetry axis exits the polytope) at an angle of formula_14. A second type of geodesic passes near the intersection of the snub disphenoid with the plane that perpendicularly bisects the symmetry axis (the equator of the polyhedron), crossing the edges of eight triangles at angles that alternate between formula_15 and formula_16. Shifting a geodesic on the surface of the polyhedron by a small amount (small enough that the shift does not cause it to cross any vertices) preserves the property of being a geodesic and preserves its length, so both of these examples have shifted versions of the same type that are less symmetrically placed. The lengths of the five simple closed geodesics on a snub disphenoid with unit-length edges are
:formula_17 (for the equatorial geodesic), formula_18, formula_19 (for the geodesic through the midpoints of opposite edges), formula_20, and formula_21.
Except for the tetrahedron, which has infinitely many types of simple closed geodesics, the snub disphenoid has the most types of geodesics of any deltahedron.

=== Representation by the graph ===

The snub disphenoid is 4-connected, meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected simplicial well-covered polyhedra, meaning that all of the maximal independent sets of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the regular octahedron, the pentagonal bipyramid, and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.

== Applications ==
In the study of computational chemistry and molecular physics, spheres centered at the vertices of the snub disphenoid form a cluster that, according to numerical experiments, has the minimum possible Lennard-Jones potential among all eight-sphere clusters.

In the geometry of chemical compounds, a polyhedron may be visualized as the atom cluster surrounding a central atom. The dodecahedral molecular geometry describes the cluster for which it is a snub disphenoid.

==History and naming==
The &quot;snub disphenoid&quot; name comes from classification of the Johnson solid. However, this solid was first studied by . It was studied again in the paper by , which first described the set of eight convex deltahedra, and named it the &quot;Siamese dodecahedron&quot;.

The &quot;dodecadeltahedron&quot; name was given to the same shape by , referring to the fact that it is a 12-sided deltahedron. There are other simplicial dodecahedra, such as the hexagonal bipyramid, but this is the only one that can be realized with equilateral faces. Bernal was interested in the shapes of holes left in irregular close-packed arrangements of spheres, so he used a restrictive definition of deltahedra, in which a deltahedron is a convex polyhedron with triangular faces that can be formed by the centers of a collection of congruent spheres, whose tangencies represent polyhedron edges, and such that there is no room to pack another sphere inside the cage created by this system of spheres. This restrictive definition disallows the triangular bipyramid (as forming two tetrahedral holes rather than a single hole), pentagonal bipyramid (because the spheres for its apexes interpenetrate, so it cannot occur in sphere packings), and regular icosahedron (because it has interior room for another sphere). Bernal writes that the snub disphenoid is &quot;a very common coordination for the calcium ion in crystallography&quot;. In coordination geometry, it is usually known as the trigonal dodecahedron or simply as the dodecahedron.

<text>Colonel By Drive () is an long scenic parkway in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. 

== Route description ==
The parkway runs along the Rideau Canal from the end of Sussex Drive at Rideau Street. It then continues south and west to Hog&#x27;s Back Road, winding through several residential areas and going past Dow&#x27;s Lake and Carleton University. To the north, the road passes Department of National Defence Headquarters, the Ottawa Congress Centre and the Westin Hotel before ending at Rideau Street. The rear door of the Senate of Canada Building can be accessed from the street as well, after it passes under the Mackenzie King Bridge.

== History ==

It is named for Lieutenant-Colonel John By, who supervised the construction of the Rideau Canal. The winding two-lane road had a speed limit of for its entire length, until in 2022 the stretch from Bronson Avenue to Daly Avenue was reduced to 40 km/h (25 mph).

For many decades the area east of the canal had held Ottawa&#x27;s main rail lines connecting to the Ottawa Union Station near the northern end of the canal. In 1966, rail service was controversially relocated to the new Ottawa Station about southeast in an industrial area in the east end of the city as part of an urban renewal plan, leaving the area on the eastern bank of the canal open for development. The Colonel By Drive was built in part on this newly-available rail right-of-way. The Queen Elizabeth Driveway, another scenic Canadian parkway, already served the same purpose on the other side of the canal.

Historically, like other National Capital Commission parkways, Colonel By Drive has been periodically closed to motor vehicle traffic and reserved for active transportation use. In 2021, the stretch between Canal Woods Terrace and Daly Avenue was closed from July 2 to September 6 for this reason. However, as of 2024, Colonel By Drive is not included in this active transportation program.

<doc id="1133571" wikidata="Q743381" url="?curid=1133571" title="Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors">
<text>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is a global professional body for those working in the Built Environment, Construction, Land, Property and Real Estate. The RICS was founded in London in 1868. It works at a cross-governmental level, and aims to promote and enforce the highest international standards in the valuation, management and development of land, real estate, construction and infrastructure.

Founded as the Institution of Surveyors, it received a royal charter in 1881, and in 1947 became the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. With a London HQ and regional offices across the United Kingdom, plus international offices, it serves a 134,000-strong membership distributed over nearly 150 countries. The RICS is linked to other national surveying institutions, collaborates with other professional bodies, and, in 2013, was a founder member of a coalition to develop the International Property Measurement Standards (IPMS). It also produces cost information and professional guidance on valuation and other activities.

In September 2021, an independent review exposed poor governance practices at the highest levels of the RICS organisation, prompting the resignations of the president, chief executive, interim chair of the governing council, and chair of the management board, in addition to the earlier resignation of the chief operating officer. The report was labelled an &quot;appalling advert for our profession on the world stage&quot;. A subsequent review published in June 2022 demanded a &quot;transformation of the institution carried out at pace&quot;.

== History ==
RICS was founded in London, England, as the Institution of Surveyors after a meeting of 49 surveyors at the Westminster Palace Hotel on 15 June 1868. The inaugural president was John Clutton (who founded Cluttons, a property firm still in business today). The organisation has occupied headquarters on the corner of Great George Street and Little George Street since then. It received a Royal charter as The Surveyors&#x27; Institution on 26 August 1881, The charter required RICS to &quot;promote the usefulness of the profession for the public advantage in the UK and in other parts of the world.&quot;

The Surveyors&#x27; Institution became the Chartered Surveyors&#x27; Institution in 1930. In 1946, George VI granted the title &quot;Royal&quot; and in 1947 the professional body became the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The RICS (with the CIOB, CIBSE, IstructE and RIBA) was a founder member of the Building Industry Council, today the Construction Industry Council, in 1988.

==International influence==
RICS has close links with many national surveying institutions and is a founding member association of the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG). Within RICS the primary areas of practice represented at FIG are geomatics (land and hydrographic survey), environment, planning, construction and valuation.

RICS works in close collaboration with other professional bodies, central banks and international organisations such as The United Nations, World Bank and The European Union.

In 2013, RICS was a founder member of the coalition to develop International Property Measurement Standards, which launched its first standard – for measuring office space – in November 2014. It launched its second standard, for measuring residential buildings, in September 2016. In 2014 RICS was a founder member of the coalition to develop International Ethics Standards, standards designed to add greater consistency to developing and reinforcing professional ethics globally – these launched in December 2016.

To add greater consistency to the benchmarking, measuring, and reporting of construction project costs, International Construction Measurement Standards were published in July 2017. The coalition for International Land Measurement Standards – aiding consistency of interpretation and documentation of tenure – launched in June 2016. In each case, coalition member bodies are committed to implementing the new standards through training and guidance for professional practitioners.

The RICS is a founder member of the International Valuation Standards Committee.

==Membership==
In 2018, there were RICS-qualified professionals in nearly 150 countries. RICS accredits 134,000 (as of September 2021) qualified and trainee professionals worldwide. The majority of accredited individuals were still based in the United Kingdom, but with large numbers also in mainland Europe, Australia and Hong Kong. There is also strong growth in membership globally, particularly in China, India and the Americas.

Entry to membership of RICS is via four main routes: academic; graduate; technical; and senior professional. RICS has links with universities worldwide, with whom they have accredited approved courses which satisfy part of the qualification requirements to become trainee surveyors. RICS also offers expedited routes to membership for qualified professional members of some partner associations.

RICS requires members to update their knowledge and competence during their working life through Continuing Professional Development. Professionals holding RICS qualifications may use the following designations after their name:
*AssocRICS (Associate); previously members at this level were known as Technical Members and used the designation &quot;TechRICS&quot;
*MRICS (Member); previously members at this level were known as Professional Associates and used the designation &quot;ARICS&quot;
*FRICS (Fellow)
*HonRICS (Honorary members)
Those with the designation MRICS or FRICS are also known as Chartered Surveyors and variations such as &quot;Chartered Building Surveyor&quot;, &quot;Chartered Valuation Surveyor&quot; or &quot;Chartered Quantity Surveyor&quot;, depending on their chosen specialist qualifications and field of expertise.

Both AssocRICS and MRICS require the collation of a candidate&#x27;s training and work experience to be assessed by RICS trained assessors,
although some may be eligible for direct entry based on international qualifications. MRICS has a higher technical bar to entry and there is an academic prerequisite which does not exist for AssocRICS.
MRICS applications are also subject to an Assessment of Professional Competence (APC) interview, held by a panel of Chartered Surveyors where the candidate&#x27;s experience, knowledge and technical skill is assessed during the interview. FRICS is the highest accolade awarded and demonstrates the professional achievements of an individual. It is an honoured class of membership awarded and an international measure of excellence. Only those who hold the MRICS designation are eligible to apply for FRICS and they must meet the required number of professional characteristics.

===Professional groups===
RICS specifies areas of specialism, each with its own professional group, clustered into Land, Property and Construction. Within each professional group there may be further specialisms.
===Specialist accreditations===
RICS aims to cover, among its practising members, property and construction related expertise generally. Specialised areas of practice expertise for which accreditation is available include:

*Building Information Modelling (BIM) Manager Certification
*Building Conservation
*Chartered Environmentalists
*Dispute Resolution
*ECO Assessor Certification
*Fixed Charge Receivership Scheme
*Valuer Registration.

===RICS Matrics===
The junior branch of RICS, known as Matrics (pronounced &quot;matrix&quot;), provides educational support, charitable and networking activities for surveying students, trainee surveyors (of any age) and Chartered Surveyors with ten years or less post-qualification experience. It comprises some 40 local groups across the United Kingdom. Established in 1889 as the Junior Committee, it became the &quot;Junior Organisation&quot; (&quot;JO&quot;) in 1928 and was re-branded as &quot;RICS Matrics&quot; in 2003. It also has links with the Young Chartered Surveyors in the Republic of Ireland.

==Governance==
The RICS is governed by a governing council, to which report a management board, a standards and regulation board, and an audit committee.

===2019-2021 governance review===
In January 2021, the RICS reversed a decision to suppress a 2019 BDO report critical of the organisation&#x27;s financial governance. According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, four non-executive directors had expressed concerns about the report&#x27;s findings, but were dismissed in November 2019 by then president Chris Brooke. Following a letter from four past presidents, the RICS initially rejected an independent review, but, after the ousted directors also wrote a letter, then said its governing council would &quot;revisit&quot; the issue, and on 22 January 2021 announced it would initiate an independent inquiry into the affair. In 2019, RICS finances were reported to have been in a difficult position, the organisation having made a pre-tax loss of £4.7m on £91.3m of income from fees and commercial activities. It subsequently made 140 people redundant. In February 2021, the RICS president Kathleen Fontana said that, in addition to the independent review into the audit report, the governing council was agreeing a strategic review into the institution&#x27;s governance and member engagement. &quot;Building&quot; reported member views that expensive membership fees did not reflect the benefits they receive, and that RICS&#x27; international expansion had been &quot;at the expense of its core UK membership, which feels disengaged and neglected&quot;.

In April 2021, Peter Oldham, the chair of the independent review of RICS&#x27;s governance resigned &quot;for professional reasons&quot;, to be replaced by Alison Levitt QC with completion delayed to June 2021 – later pushed back to mid-August 2021. On 4 June 2021, &quot;Building&quot; reported the &quot;surprise&quot; resignation and immediate departure of RICS&#x27; chief operating officer Violetta Parylo amid &quot;a storm of calls&quot; from members for reform. The RICS review of its purpose and relevance had been published in May 2021. Based on 9,000 responses, it reported members&#x27; trust in the RICS had plummeted by nearly a third, while satisfaction with membership had fallen to a historic low of 43%.

====Levitt review====
Levitt&#x27;s governance review was delivered to the RICS in early August but not immediately made public, prompting calls for its full publication; the report was first reviewed by a five-strong subgroup of RICS&#x27;s 26-member governing council. &quot;Property Week&quot; columnist Peter Bill said &quot;a private tiff has ballooned into a crisis of confidence in the 130,000-member institution&quot; with a defensive management facing a small but powerful group of disaffected members. After the August departure of RICS managing director Matthew Howell, RICS CEO Sean Tompkins resigned on 9 September 2021, when the full Levitt Review was published; Tompkins also forfeited a £190,000 bonus payment. In light of the Review findings, RICS president Kathleen Fontana, the interim chair of the governing council Chris Brooke, and management board chair Paul Marcuse also resigned, and RICS terminated its relationship with London law firm Fieldfisher, criticised by Levitt for being &quot;demonstrably and inappropriately partisan.&quot;

Levitt said the RICS had made it &quot;as difficult as possible&quot; for people to contact the review; &quot;RICS management and others on occasion&quot; gave an &quot;impression of reluctant acquiescence&quot; during her investigations, she said. Her 467-page report concluded that the four non-executive board members had been wrongly dismissed and that sound governance principles were not followed. The CEO and COO thus operated with little effective scrutiny and become resistant to challenge amid &quot;a power struggle&quot;. Levitt recommended &quot;a wide-ranging external review of purpose, governance and strategy, led by an independent reviewer&quot;, plus interim recommendations relating to governance, executive remuneration, whistle-blowing and legal advice. The RICS governing council committed to apologise to the dismissed non-executive directors, and to implement all the report&#x27;s recommendations. On 30 September 2021, &quot;Building&quot; reported on a &quot;grovelling public apology&quot; from the RICS to the wrongfully dismissed non-executive directors, and said an external review of the institution&#x27;s future purpose was set to start within weeks. The ousted non-executive directors welcomed the formal apology but said it was &quot;difficult to accept it as a statement of genuine contrition&quot;.

Gleeds chairman and &quot;Building&quot; columnist Richard Steer called the governance scandal an &quot;appalling advert for our profession on the world stage&quot; and said RICS needed to undergo a &quot;complete restructuring&quot;. Paul Roberts, MD of global law firm Secretariat, said all 21 members of the RICS&#x27;s governing council should be removed and replaced with new blood elected by the RICS membership.

In October 2021, the RICS refused a request by 40 former and current employees to launch an investigation into how the institution selected staff to be furloughed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The employees group alleged that some staff were furloughed as RICS had considered them too supportive of the institution&#x27;s membership, and sought a review of RICS&#x27;s human resource procedures, but RICS refused, considering the matter closed.

The Cabinet Office provided advice on suitable individuals to lead the review of the RICS&#x27;s future purpose. In December 2021, the RICS announced former senior civil servant Michael Bichard would lead a six-month review into its governance and future purpose, with three objectives set by the RICS&#x27;s governing council: to &quot;create clarity&quot; about the RICS&#x27; purpose, to propose how the organisation could be a &quot;beacon for best practice&quot; in governance, transparency and accountability, and to ensure that governance is &quot;fit for today&quot; and could remain relevant in future.

====Bichard review====
The 68-page Bichard review, recommending sweeping reforms, was published on 21 June 2022. It said the future success of the organisation would &quot;require nothing less than a transformation of the institution carried out at pace&quot;; the need for change was &quot;urgent&quot; and &quot;unarguable&quot;. Bichard&#x27;s recommendations included: a renewed and increased focus on the public interest remit of RICS, including amending the Royal Charter and creating a public interest panel to advise the RICS&#x27;s Governing Council; maintaining self-regulation, through greater independence for regulatory functions; increased focus on diversity and inclusion; empowering and enabling members through greater support for regional boards, alongside increased member engagement, with renewed focus on younger members; an independent review of RICS&#x27;s governance and effectiveness at delivering against its Charter for the public advantage once every five years; a new simplified, clear, accountable governance structure; and greater leadership on major society issues such as sustainability and climate change. Bichard also said the RICS should seek to continue to increase its influence overseas - a policy that was &quot;very contentious&quot; among the institution&#x27;s 140,000 members.

Bichard said: &quot;My aim has been to help create a new sense of purpose and direction so that RICS can once more stand tall as an exemplar professional institution, capable of tackling the challenges which will shape the way we all live our lives in the years to come. Issues such as climate change and sustainability, improving the built environment and building safety all sit within the remit of RICS and will benefit from the contribution which a revitalised RICS could make.&quot;

Nick Maclean, interim chair of RICS&#x27;s governing council, said: &quot;The Bichard RICS Review represents a watershed moment for the institution, and a key point in time which sets out a path for permanent improvement. Implementation of the recommendations will provide a solid accountable structure to effectively support our professionals and work in the public interest. RICS governing council strongly endorses the recommendations, and will implement these proposals.&quot; McLean was set to stand down on 5 October 2022, his role being abolished as part of Bichard&#x27;s recommendations; the chief executive role would also be replaced by a new director general.

In August 2022, Bichard was appointed as interim senior independent governor through to 31 December 2023, responsible for scrutinising the actions of the RICS&#x27; governing council and committees. In December 2022, the RICS announced the establishment of a new board to oversee day-to-day operations and deliver the governing council&#x27;s strategic plan. It is to be chaired by former CBRE Group director Martin Samworth. He will also review proposed changes to constitutional documents, including the RICS&#x27;s Royal Charter, recommended in Bichard&#x27;s review.

===Governance review over fire safety===
In January 2022, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities was reporting to be planning legislation to enable regular reviews of the RICS&#x27;s governance. Ministers were said to be frustrated by a RICS decision in December 2021 to maintain its valuation advice requiring External Wall System forms (EWS1s) on blocks under 18m high. Richard Collins, the RICS&#x27;s interim CEO, publicly questioned the need for the proposed new law to monitor RICS&#x27;s governance.

===Presidents===
The first president was John Clutton, who was elected in 1868. The first female president was Louise Brooke-Smith, who was elected in 2014.

==Administration==
RICS headquarters is in London, with its main support functions in Birmingham. There are regional offices in the United Kingdom, across mainland Europe, in China, Singapore, Australia, the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, North America and Brazil.

==Guidance==
===BCIS===

BCIS, the Building Cost Information Service, was established in 1962 and provides independent cost and price information to the construction industry and others needing comprehensive, accurate and independent data. It was spun out of RICS in 2022, becoming an independent company. 

===Isurv===

Isurv is an online information service for expertise in natural and built environments. Launched by the RICS in September 2003, it provides insight from verified legal experts and industry practitioners relating to construction.

=== Rental valuation of public houses, bars, restaurants and nightclubs in England and Wales ===
The primary RICS professional guidance on this subject is covered at VPGA 4 Valuation. It provides practical assistance to valuers dealing with public houses which are valued and assessed in a completely different way than other commercial businesses.

Public houses are valued by the profits method of valuation, often referred to as Fair Maintainable Trade Or Turnover (FMT). The FMT method applies to tens of thousands of commercial properties in England and Wales and is the basis of rateable valuation by the Valuation Office Agency, who also follow this method. RICS guidance (&#x27;The Red Book&#x27;) emphasises that a valuer specialising in such valuations are regularly involved in the market, as practical knowledge of the factors affecting the market is essential to analysis of comparable transactions.

===SMM===
The &quot;Standard Method of Measurement&quot; (SMM) published by the RICS consisted of classification tables and rules of measurement, allowing use of a uniform basis for measuring building works. It was first published in 1922, superseding a Scottish Standard Method of Measurement which had been published in 1915. Its seventh edition (SMM7) was first published in 1988 and revised in 1998. SMM7 was replaced by the &quot;New Rules of Measurement&quot;, volume 2 (NRM2), which were published in April 2012 by the RICS Quantity Surveying and Construction Professional Group and became operational on 1 January 2013. NRM2 has been in general use since July 2013.

SMM7 was accompanied by the Code of Procedure for the Measurement of Building Works (the SMM7 Measurement Code). Whilst SMM7 could have a contractual status within a project, for example in the JCT Standard form of Building Contract), the Measurement Code was not mandatory.

NRM2 Is the second of three component parts within the NRM suite:
* NRM1 – Order of cost estimating and cost planning for capital building works
* NRM2 – Detailed measurement for building works
* NRM3 – Order of cost estimating and cost planning for building maintenance works.

===Commercial leases===
A commercial lease code was published in 2020 as part of an RICS professional statement to promote best practice, replacing a code of practice for commercial leases first developed in 1995, with updates issued in 2002 and 2007. The initial code was seen as an attempt to balance relationships between landlords and premises renters, especially in the small business sector. The code adopted in 2020 reflected a perception that &quot;the lettings market became more evenly balanced between landlords and tenants&quot; by this time. The code operates as a professional statement with mandatory obligations applicable to RICS members and regulated firms, and separately as a &quot;good practice&quot; document without the mandatory requirements, for use outside a professional context.

==Charitable works==
Lionheart is the benevolent fund for past and present RICS members and their families. The charity was established in 1899 and provides financial support, health and well-being packages, and work-related counselling and befriending support. RICS also supports the Chartered Surveyors Training Trust, which helps young people enter the profession through apprenticeships; Charity Property Help, which provides property advice to charities and voluntary organisations, and The Chartered Surveyors&#x27; Voluntary Service (CSVS), a registered charity providing free property advice to people who would otherwise struggle to access professional assistance.

<text>Alicia Minshew (born May 28, 1974) is an American actress. She is best known for portraying Kendall Hart on the daytime drama &quot;All My Children&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Minshew was born in Plantation, Florida. Her mother is of Italian descent. Having aspirations to become an actress, Minshew set out for the career path some time after graduating from South Fork High School in Stuart, Florida.

In November 2001, Minshew landed the role of Kendall Hart on the daytime drama &quot;All My Children&quot; and began filming the following month, after the character&#x27;s seven-year absence from the soap opera following the exit of Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had previously portrayed the character. Debuting in the January 8, 2002, episode, Minshew played the role of Kendall until the series finale on September 23, 2011. She reprised the role in 2013 during its brief revival. In 2004 and 2005, Minshew portrayed Kendall in brief appearances on the daytime drama &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as part of a baby-swap storyline.

In 2009, Minshew gave birth to her first child and went on maternity leave right as &quot;All My Children&quot; relocated production to Los Angeles.

In August 2012, Minshew was cast as the lead in the film, &quot;Desires of the Heart&quot; which began filming in Savannah, Georgia. In the new film directed by James Kicklighter, Minshew plays a Georgia artist who falls in love with an Indian psychiatrist and follows him back to his homeland, where his parents have arranged a marriage with another woman.

From 2013 to 2014, Minshew played Angelica Caruso on the soap opera web series &quot;Tainted Dreams&quot;. In 2014, Minshew played New York City reporter Sara Preston in the soap opera web series &quot;Beacon Hill&quot;. She was nominated for a 2015 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a New Approaches Drama Series for the role.

In 2016, Alicia Minshew wrapped taping of the musical TV faith-based series &quot;Wholly Broken.&quot; The actress plays Kim and described the character as, &quot;The character I play, however, is not a stretch from my soap days! She may be yet another one you love to hate. I play Kim, the self absorbed, headstrong, somewhat unhappy lawyer wife of Tom (the lead character). There is some serious conflict in their life and marriage. You will see how it all plays out. It was a fun role to play. I had a blast with Tom.&quot;

==Personal life==
In October 2008, Minshew married Richie Herschenfeld, a New York City restaurant owner who is also the best friend of actor Thorsten Kaye, her long time on-screen husband. She is close friends with co-star Rebecca Budig. Minshew and her husband welcomed the birth of their daughter Willow Lenora Herschenfeld on November 4, 2009

<text>Clarkefield railway station is a regional railway station on the Deniliquin line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the north-western suburb and town of Clarkefield, in Victoria, Australia. Clarkefield station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened in December 1862.

The station had various names. It initially opened as Lancefield Road, then it was renamed to Lancefield Junction in 1881. Then it had two various names of the same pronunciation, but different spelling. It was renamed to Clarkfield on 11 January 1926, then finally was given its current name of Clarkefield on 23 February 1926.

==History==

Clarkefield opened in December 1862, a year after the line opened between Sunbury and Woodend. The station, like the township itself, was named after local pastoralist, businessman and philanthropist, Sir William Clarke. Clarke later became a member of the Victorian Legislative Council.

The station was the junction for the Lancefield branch line, which operated between 1881 and 1956. The station was historically known as Lancefield Junction for this reason.

Catch points were in use at Clarkefield in 1929. By 1935, they were abolished. In 1947, the signal box at the station was replaced with a signal bay.

After the closure of the Lancefield line in 1956, a small remnant of the line became a refuge siding. Around 1958/1959, a siding that operated between the up mainline track and the former dock platform was abolished, and the siding leading to the turntable was removed by 1959.

In 1977, the connections from the refuge siding to the up line was spiked out of use, with the auxiliary frame also abolished around this time.

On 17 January 2005, the signal bay at the station was abolished.

Disused station Rupertswood is located between Clarkefield and Sunbury stations.

==Platforms and services==

Clarkefield has two side platforms. In the morning, trains to Melbourne depart from Platform 2, and trains to Bendigo depart from Platform 1, with this arrangement reversing in the afternoon. This is to allow services in the peak direction of travel to use the single 160 km/h track that was upgraded in 2006, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.

It is serviced by V/Line Bendigo and Echuca line services.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross, Kyneton, Bendigo, Eaglehawk and Epsom

<text>Riddells Creek railway station is a regional railway station on the Deniliquin line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the north-western suburb and town of Riddells Creek, in Victoria, Australia. Riddells Creek station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 July 1861, with the current station provided in 2014.

Initially opened as Riddells Creek, the station was renamed to Riddell on 9 May 1904. It then was renamed back to its current name of Riddells Creek on 12 October 1976. 

==History==

Riddells Creek opened with the line on 8 July 1861. The station, like the township itself, was named after local settler John Riddell, who acquired property in the area in 1841. Riddell later became a member of the Victorian Legislative Council and the Victorian Legislative Assembly.

In 1864, a goods shed and goods platform was provided on the down platform (Platform 2). By 1879, the station had a signal box and was a block post, using the telegraph instruments, with Winter&#x27;s instruments provided by 1890.

The station was renamed Riddell on 9 May 1904, as part of a policy by the Victorian Railways to adopt short station names. By this time, there was two sidings to the south of Platform 2.

On 12 October 1976, the station was renamed back to Riddells Creek.

A six lever frame was provided in 1927, to control the signals, until it was closed as a block post in April 1993. After this, the signals and interlocking were abolished, and a crossover at the up end of the station was spiked.

As part of the Regional Fast Rail project in 2005, the station received a refurbishment, including new platform facings and new fencing. In 2010, the goods shed was refurbished into a waiting room and ticket office. In January 2014, the platforms were extended to accommodate longer trains.

==Platforms and services==

Riddells Creek has two side platforms. In the morning, trains to Melbourne depart from Platform 2, and trains to Bendigo depart from Platform 1, with this arrangement reversing in the afternoon. This is to allow services in the peak direction of travel to use the single 160 km/h track that was upgraded in 2006, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.

<text>Gisborne railway station is a regional railway station on the Bendigo Line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the north-western suburb and town of New Gisborne, in Victoria, Australia. Gisborne station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 July 1861.

==History==

Gisborne station opened on 8 July 1861, when the railway line was extended from Sunbury to Woodend. Like the town itself, the station was after Henry Fyshe Gisborne, who was Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Port Phillip District between 1839 and 1840.

In 1910, the station became a block post for all trains on the line. In 1922, an interlocking frame was provided in the station building on Platform 1.

By 1990, siding &quot;B&quot; and the track that passed through the former goods shed were abolished. In 1994, the connection between siding &quot;A&quot; and a crossover, that was located at the up end of the station, was removed. In 1996, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the Station Road level crossing, located at the down end of the station. The up end crossover was also removed by that year. In 2000, the goods shed was destroyed by fire.

On 17 January 2005, the interlocking frame was abolished. In March 2014, the platforms were extended to accommodate longer trains.

==Platforms and services==

Gisborne has two side platforms. During the morning peak, services to Southern Cross depart from Platform 2, and services to Bendigo depart from Platform 1, with this arrangement reversing after 9:00am. This is to allow services in the peak direction of travel to use the single 160 km/h track that was upgraded in 2006, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.

The station is serviced by V/Line Bendigo, Echuca and Swan Hill line services.

Platform 1:
* services to Kyneton, Bendigo, Epsom, Eaglehawk and Southern Cross
* services to Echuca and Southern Cross
* services to Swan Hill and Southern Cross

<doc id="1133638" wikidata="Q330856" url="?curid=1133638" title="Robert Rowand Anderson">
<text>Sir Robert Rowand Anderson, (5 April 1834 – 1 June 1921) was a Scottish Victorian architect. Anderson trained in the office of George Gilbert Scott in London before setting up his own practice in Edinburgh in 1860. During the 1860s his main work was small churches in the &#x27;First Pointed&#x27; (or Early English) style that is characteristic of Scott&#x27;s former assistants. By 1880 his practice was designing some of the most prestigious public and private buildings in Scotland.

His works include the Scottish National Portrait Gallery; the Dome of Old College, Medical Faculty and McEwan Hall, the University of Edinburgh; Govan Old Parish Church and the Pearce Institute; the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station, the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh and Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute for the 3rd Marquess of Bute.

==Early life==
Anderson was born at Liberton, outside Edinburgh, the third child of James Anderson (1797-1869), a solicitor, and Margaret Rowand (1797-1868). Educated at George Watson&#x27;s College, he began a legal apprenticeship in 1845, and briefly worked for his father&#x27;s firm. He began to study architecture in 1849, attending classes at the Trustees&#x27; Drawing Academy (which later became Edinburgh College of Art), and was articled to architect John Lessels (1809–1883).

In 1857 he took a two-year post as an assistant to George Gilbert Scott, in his office at Trafalgar Square, London. Here he worked alongside many influential architects. He then spent time travelling and studying in France and Italy, also working briefly for Pierre Cuypers in Roermond, Netherlands.

==Architectural career==

In 1860, Anderson returned to Edinburgh, and began working as an architect with the Royal Engineers, undertaking works on coastal defences, and the 78th Highlanders memorial outside Edinburgh Castle. For Giles Gilbert Scott, he supervised the construction of St James&#x27;s Church in Leith, which led to further commissions from the Scottish Episcopal Church, including Christ Church, Falkirk (1862), All Saints, Brougham Place, Edinburgh (1864), St Andrew&#x27;s Church in St Andrews (1866), St John&#x27;s, Alloa (1866), and St James, Cupar (1866). All of these were carried out alongside his work for the Royal Engineers, and show the influence of Scott&#x27;s church designs.

Anderson set up his own independent practice in 1868. In 1869, St Mungo&#x27;s Church in Balerno was completed to his design. 

His first significant commission came in 1871, for the restoration of St Vigeans Parish Church, Angus. He went on to win the competition to design the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh, now the Mansfield Traquair Centre on Mansfield Place in Broughton. Anderson joined the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, where he met future clients including the Marquis of Bute. In 1873 a short-lived partnership with David Bryce began, but was dissolved only a few months later.

In 1874, he was invited to submit designs for a competition for the University of Edinburgh Medical Faculty and graduation hall. He undertook further study tours to Europe, resulting in the winning Italian Renaissance style design which was finalised in 1877. The design secured Anderson&#x27;s election to the Royal Scottish Academy, although the Medical School was not completed until 1886, and the McEwan Hall not until 1897. His next major commission came soon after, in 1876, when he was appointed as architect for Glasgow Central Station. In 1878 Anderson designed a new Mount Stuart House (1878–1896) in an Italian Gothic style for the 3rd Marquess of Bute, following the destruction by fire of the previous house. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery (1884–1889) was designed in a similar style, and also executed in red sandstone.

In 1881, Anderson made his employee George Washington Browne a partner, and two years later the firm became Wardrop, Anderson and Browne, following the death of Maitland Wardrop and the merger of his practice with Anderson&#x27;s. However, Browne left in 1885, and Hew Wardrop died in 1887 at Udny Castle, leaving Anderson as sole partner again. Notable architects employed within the Anderson practice included Robert Weir Schultz, Robert Lorimer, and Sydney Mitchell.

During the 1880s, Anderson&#x27;s style became increasingly influenced by Scottish historical architecture, possibly as a result of his friendship with architectural historians MacGibbon and Ross. The Scottish influence is evident in the Normand Memorial Hall, Dysart (1882), Ardgowan Estate Office, Greenock (1886), and the Pearce Institute, Govan (1892).

From the 1890s, restoration became the focus of Anderson&#x27;s architecture, as major commissions declined. He had already undertaken work at Iona Abbey and Jedburgh Abbey in the 1870s, and now restored Dunblane Cathedral and Paisley Abbey. He became more involved in teaching, helping to set up a School of Applied Art in 1892. In 1903 this merged into the new Edinburgh College of Art, with Anderson as a trustee.

In his later years Anderson became difficult to work with, and was perceived as arrogant. Another partnership, formed in 1899, was dissolved following lawsuits in 1902. Rowand Anderson and Paul was formed in 1904, with Arthur Forman Balfour Paul (who had trained under him from 1892 to 1896), son of Sir James Balfour Paul, the Lord Lyon.

Anderson was knighted in the 1902 Birthday Honours for his work at the Scottish royal residence, Balmoral Castle. In 1916 he was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for architecture. 

By 1916, he was ill, but was able to found the Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (later the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland) in that year, with fellow architect Alexander Lorne Campbell speaking and acting on his behalf. Anderson donated his own Rutland Square townhouse to be used as its headquarters.

He retired to Allermuir House on Woodhall Road in Colinton and died there in 1921. He is buried in Warriston Cemetery. The grave is in a hard to find location on a lower level to the south-west, backing onto the western path.
==The Rowand Anderson practice==
Anderson&#x27;s architectural practice was carried on as Rowand Anderson and Paul (with Paul as sole partner), until Basil Spence and William Kininmonth joined in 1934, forming Rowand Anderson and Paul and Partners. Paul died in 1938, and Spence left in 1945, leaving Kininmonth to carry on as Rowand Anderson, Kininmonth and Paul. When Kininmonth retired in 1976, the firm split, with the Rowand Anderson name taken by Richard Ewing, who had been made a partner around 1971. The Rowand Anderson Partnership is still based in Rutland Square.

<doc id="1133651" wikidata="Q7702968" url="?curid=1133651" title="Ternus illusion">
<text>The Ternus illusion, also commonly referred to as the Ternus Effect, is an illusion related to human visual perception involving apparent motion. In a simplified explanation of one form of the illusion, two discs, (referred to here as L for left and C for centre) are shown side by side as the first frame in a sequence of three frames. Next a blank frame is presented for a very short, variable duration. In the final frame, two similar discs (C for centre and R for right) are then shown in a shifted position. Depending on various factors including the time intervals between frames as well as spacing and layout, observers perceive either element motion, in which L appears to move to R while C remains stationary or they report experiencing group motion, in which L and C appear to move together to C and R. Both element motion and group motion can be observed in animated examples to the right in Figures 1 and 2.

==Overview==
In 1926 and then again in 1938, the Gestalt psychologist Joseph Ternus observed and defined the &quot;problem of phenomenal identity&quot;. Ternus&#x27; research was based around earlier undertakings in the domain by Pikler in 1917. This problem of phenomenal identity that Ternus had discovered occurs due to the human visual system&#x27;s natural ability to establish and then preserve the entities of objects even when the defining attributes of those objects have undergone drastic changes and no longer resemble what they once did. The effect that Ternus had observed was in fact a bistable percept or perception of apparent motion which he found using a display consisting of three frames presented sequentially.

When observers are presented with two immobile stimuli, that are presented in a sequential fashion at two differing locations, the stimuli will often be perceived as a solitary object that is simply moving from a starting location to another position. This apparent motion or apparent movement is of great interest to researchers because the perceived movement does not derive strictly from the physical aspect of vision such as the stimulation caused by impingement on the retina. Instead, apparent motion appears to arise from the visual system&#x27;s processing of the physical properties of the percept. It is for this reason that apparent motion is a key area of research in the domain of vision research. The Ternus illusion is perhaps one of the best examples of such an effect.

In order to observe the Ternus illusion/effect, observers view an apparent motion display known as a Ternus display. The Ternus display features a series of frames that are separated by what is known as a blank interstimulus interval (ISI). A standard Ternus display consists of three frames, sequentially presented to the observer. As can be seen in Figure 3, Frame 1 consists of three equally spread out discs that are laid out in a horizontal fashion. Frame 2 is the blank ISI which separates Frame 1 and 3 for a variable duration. Frame 3, is simply the reverse of Frame 1 with the discs on the right hand side instead. This means that the disc on the outside of Frame 1 will now appear to be in the location that the centre disc was originally in as part of Frame 1.

When these three frames are quickly presented in a sequential manner, individuals report perceiving two discrete types of motion from observing the Ternus display. These different perceptions are dependent on the duration of the ISI. Numerous studies have demonstrated that short ISIs cause the observer to perceive the central elements as immobile with one outside element jumping across those elements, known as element motion. These studies also support the finding that longer ISIs create the perception that the elements are all moving as one from left to right, known as group motion and that these percepts are not capable of occurring simultaneously. Research suggests that these variations in apparent motion are achieved by grouping the visual elements in such a way that there is an intertwining of the perception of motion and the perception of the objects identity.

At intermediate ISIs, perceived motion is bistable, meaning that for the observer the perceptual experience interchanges between element motion and group motion in a spontaneous manner. While the bistability is present, observers are still capable of judging which percept leaves more of a lasting impression. As aforementioned the two percepts are never experienced simultaneously. This occurs due to intermediate ISIs yielding different percentages of group movement and element movement that are each dependent upon their exact values.

==Element motion==

Element motion can be observed when ISI’s are presented for less than 50 milliseconds. Though the most common time frame used to achieve this illusion is usually around 20 milliseconds. Element motion is characterized as the outer disc in the Ternus display being seen as &quot;jumping over&quot; the other two discs in the display, which are then considered to be the (inner) discs; placing itself in the right hand side location. This effect can be seen in motion in the example at the top of the page in Figure 1.

According to Braddick from his research in 1980, element motion can be attributed to the low-level short range motion process, signalling a null or no-movement for the two elements in the middle of the display between Frame 1 and Frame 3 when short ISIs are shown. As a response to this the higher level long-range motion process passes a signal of element movement. This means that the outer element appears to jump across to the opposite side of the display and back again.

==Group motion==

When the ISI (Frame 2) in the Ternus motion display is shown for the relatively long interval of at least 50 milliseconds, group motion can be observed. The longer the inter-frame interval or ISI the more likely a group motion effect is to occur.

Group motion gives the perceiver the illusion that all of the discs within the display are moving simultaneously to the right and then back again. As with element motion this effect can be seen in Figure 3 as well as demonstrated in Figure 2. Braddick in 1980 posited that the occurrence of group motion at longer ISIs can be attributed to the short-range motion process signalling motion in the central elements of the motion display, which in turn leads to the long-range process to signal that the three elements are moving in unison.

==Factors==
Since the discovery of the Ternus illusion there has been an abundance of research into how and why it occurs. As can be deemed from research above, one of the most critical factors appears to be the length of the ISI, as it seems to be a heavy determinant in which percept becomes apparent to the observer however there are many other factors implicated. A reasonable amount of the research in this area appears to be well empirically supported, such as the idea that lower level (short range processes) and higher level (long range processes) are involved in determining which illusion is perceived.

A study by Scott-Samuel &amp; Hess found that the perception of element motion is influenced by changes in the spatial appearance within the Ternus display which suggests that apparent motion is mediated entirely by a long-range motion process. Research undertaken by Kramer and Yantis in 1997 found that perceptual grouping of the elements also appears to have important implications. Kramer and his colleagues found an increase in observers perceiving group motion when the elements in the display seemed to form a logical group in contrast to when they were independently arranged.

Yantis found that the perceived continuity of a briefly interrupted element in perception depends on early neural mechanisms in the visual system such as visible persistence as well as on a representation of a three-dimensional surface layout.

As previously mentioned, studies have alluded to the idea that high level motion mechanisms determine the final decision in which percept shows through, however recent research by He &amp; Ooi suggests that this final decision is also influenced by accounting for numerous grouping factors such as proximity, similarity and common surface amongst the elements in the scene.

Though there are many ideas relating to causative factors, even current research seems to be lacking in a conclusive explanation for why the Ternus effect occurs and has not yet discovered exactly which mechanisms are responsible. Petersik and his team in 2006 suggested that intensive brain-imaging research on each percept is the way forward and is the most likely way to discover the answer. On the other hand, Grossberg and Rudd (1992, Psychol. Rev., 99, 78–121) have developed a neural model of motion perception that simulates many examples of long-range apparent motion, including both the Ternus and reverse-contrast Ternus illusions.

<text>Garry Eldridge Brown (August 12, 1923 – August 27, 1998) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served six terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1967 to 1979.

==Biography==
Brown was born in Schoolcraft, Michigan on August 12, 1923 to a family with a political background in Michigan. His great-grandfather, Ebenezer Lakin Brown, and his grandfather, Addison Makepeace Brown, both served in the Michigan State Legislature.

During World War II, Brown served in the Twenty-fourth Infantry Regiment of the United States Army as second lieutenant in Japan. After the war, he worked for the FBI, under Hoover, before earning a B.A. from Kalamazoo College in 1951 and a LL.B from George Washington University Law School in 1954. He was admitted to the bar in 1954 and commenced practice in Kalamazoo. He was commissioner of the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan from 1957 to 1962 and was a delegate to the Michigan constitutional convention of 1961-1962.

==Political career==
He served two terms in the Michigan State Senate from 1963 to 1966, where he was minority floor leader and chairman of the Republican senate policy committee. He represented the 6th district from 1963 to 1964 and the 21st district from 1965 to 1966.

In 1966, Brown defeated incumbent Democrat Paul H. Todd, Jr., one of the &quot;Five Fluke Freshmen&quot;, to be elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 3rd congressional district for the Ninetieth and to the five succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1967 to January 3, 1979.

Brown took the lead in October 1972 in obstructing the efforts of Rep. Wright Patman, D-TX, to have the House Banking and Currency Committee investigate the flow of illegal campaign funds to the Watergate burglars. By July 1973, with the scheme unraveling in the courts and in televised Senate hearings, Brown was admitting he had been wrong to do so. 

He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1978, losing to Democrat Howard E. Wolpe.

==Personal life==
He resumed the practice of law and was a resident of Washington, D.C. until his death.

Garry Brown married Frances Wilkins in 1955, together they had four daughters, Frances, Mollie, Amelia, and Abigail. His family owned and operated a dairy farm while he was growing up in Schoolcraft, Michigan. They were one of the first to settle there, and his family still owns the original property that the Browns settled on in the 1830s.

== Death ==
Brown died on August 27, 1998 in Washington, D.C. and was laid to rest in Schoolcraft, Michigan.

<text>National Galleries Scotland: Portrait is an art museum on Queen Street, Edinburgh. Portrait holds the national collections of portraits, all of which are of, but not necessarily by, Scots. It also holds the Scottish National Photography Collection.

Since 1889 it has been housed in its red sandstone Gothic revival building, designed by Robert Rowand Anderson and built between 1885 and 1890 to accommodate the gallery and the museum collection of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. The building was donated by John Ritchie Findlay, owner of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper. In 1985 the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland was amalgamated with the Royal Scottish Museum, and later moved to Chambers Street as part of the National Museum of Scotland. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery expanded to take over the whole building, and reopened on 1 December 2011 as “Portrait” after being closed since April 2009 for the first comprehensive refurbishment in its history, carried out by Page\Park Architects.

Portrait is part of National Galleries Scotland, a public body that also owns the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh.

==History==
The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was founded in 1780 by David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan. Its members donated items of interest, and in 1781 it bought a place to properly store this material, the Antiquarian Society Hall, located between the Cowgate and Parliament Close, just to the west of Old Fishmarket Close, as shown on Alexander Kincaid&#x27;s &quot;Plan of the City&quot;. It moved several times, from 1826 it rented space in the Royal Institution at the foot of The Mound, owned by the Board of Manufactures. By 1851 its collections were in 24 George Street, in November it agreed with the Board to make the collections National Property, with the government to provide continuing accommodation for the collections and for the Society&#x27;s meetings. As part of the agreement, the collections moved back to the Royal Institution in 1858.

Erskine had also formed a collection of Scottish portraits in the late 18th century, many are now in the museum. When the National Portrait Gallery, London, was established in 1856 and became very successful, the Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle was among those calling for a Scottish equivalent, but the government was reluctant to commit to funding the project.

In 1882 John Ritchie Findlay endowed a new building on Queen Street, costing £50,000, designed by Robert Rowand Anderson to accommodate both the antiquities collections and the portraits. It was completed in 1890. At the centre of the facade of the symmetrical building, a large Main Hall formed a shared entrance to the two institutions. Portrait occupied the east wing of the building, and the Museum of Antiquities took up the west wing.

The portrait gallery was established in 1882, before its new building was completed. The London National Portrait Gallery was the first such separate museum in the world, however it did not move into its current purpose-built building until 1896, making the Edinburgh gallery the first in the world to be specially built as a portrait gallery. Special national portrait galleries remain a distinct Anglophone speciality, with the other more recent examples in Washington DC (1968), Canberra, Australia (1998), and Ottawa, Canada (2001) not so far copied in other countries. The famous collection of portraits housed in the Vasari Corridor in Florence remains only accessible to the public on a limited basis.

The building was opened in 1889 under curator John Miller Gray. Over the years new facilities such as a shop and café were added in a piecemeal fashion, and the galleries rearranged and remodelled, generally reducing the clarity of the layout of the building, and often the ceiling height, as well as blocking off many windows. The building was shared with the National Museum of Antiquities, which latterly became the Museum of Scotland and moved to a new building in 2009, at which point the long-planned refurbishment of the portrait gallery could begin, with funding from the Scottish Government and the Heritage Lottery Fund, amongst others. The work generally restores the gallery spaces to their original layout, with areas set aside for education, the shop &amp; café, and a new glass lift—greatly improving access for disabled visitors. In total Portrait has 60% more gallery space after the changes, and at the reopening displayed 849 works, of which 480 were by Scots. The cost of the refurbishment was £17.6 million. The entire building comprises 5672 Sq. metres.

==The building==

The National Portrait Gallery building is a large edifice at the east end of Queen Street, built in red sandstone from Corsehill Quarry, outside Annan in Dumfriesshire. It was designed by Robert Rowand Anderson in the Gothic Revival style with a combination of Arts and Crafts and 13th-century Gothic influences, and is a Category A listed building. Built between 1885 and 1890, the building is noted for its ornate Spanish Gothic style, an unusual addition to Edinburgh&#x27;s mostly Georgian Neoclassical New Town. The windows are in carved pointed arches and the main entrance on the Queen Street front, surrounded a large gabled arch, leads to the main entrance hall, arcaded with pointed arches, which originally served both the National Portrait Gallery to its east, and the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland to its west. A distinctive feature of the gallery is its four octagonal corner towers topped with crocketed Gothic pinnacles; originally, Anderson had intended to flank the facade with a pair of large Franco-Scottish tourelles, but these were replaced at the request of the benefactor by the pointed turrets seen today.

Anderson&#x27;s design was influenced by a number of other Gothic and Gothic Revival architectural works, in particular the rectangular Gothic Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice and the works of George Gilbert Scott, and similarities have also been drawn between the Portrait Gallery and Anderson&#x27;s Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, which he designed for the 3rd Marquess of Bute in the late 1870s.

Around the exterior are sculpted figures of noted Scots set in niches, designed by William Birnie Rhind. These were added in the 1890s to compensate for the lack of contemporary portraits of medieval Scots in the gallery&#x27;s collection at the time, as was the large processional frieze inside the main entrance hall, painted by William Hole. This mural, added in 1898, depicts an array of notable Scots from history, ranging from Saint Ninian to Robert Burns. Figures were added to the frieze over the years after the gallery opened, and Hole added further large mural narrative scenes on the 1st floor later.

==Collection==
The museum&#x27;s collection totals some 3,000 paintings and sculptures, 25,000 prints and drawings, and 38,000 photographs. The collection essentially begins in the Renaissance, initially with works mainly by foreign artists of Scottish royalty, nobility, and mainly printed portraits of clergymen and writers; the most notable paintings were mostly made on the Continent (often during periods of exile from the turbulent Scottish political scene). As in England, the Scottish Reformation all but extinguished religious art, and until the 19th century portrait painting dominated Scottish painting, with patrons gradually extending down the social scale. In the 16th century most painted portraits are of royalty or the more important nobility; the oldest work in the collection is a portrait of James IV of Scotland from 1507.

The collection includes two portraits of Mary, Queen of Scots, although neither dates from her lifetime; one was painted some 20 years after her death in 1587, and the other is later still; there are also a number of 19th-century paintings showing scenes from her life. Mary&#x27;s circle is actually better represented by portraits from the life, with her three husbands all having portraits, including Darnley by Hans Eworth and an unknown painter, and miniatures from 1566 of Bothwell and his first wife. There is a portrait of Mary&#x27;s nemesis, Regent Morton, by Arnold Bronckhorst who was from 1581 the first artist to hold the title of &quot;King&#x27;s Painter&quot; in Scotland, though he only spent about three years there. The gallery holds several works by Bronckhorst and his successor, Adrian Vanson; both were skilled painters in the Netherlandish tradition.

The collection includes portraits by Bronckhorst and Vanson of James VI and I, but the others were made after he succeeded to the English throne and moved to London, where the many portraits of other Stuart monarchs were also mostly painted. The first significant native Scot to be a portrait painter, George Jamesone (1589/90-1644) only once got the chance to paint his monarch, when Charles I visited Edinburgh in 1633. The collection includes two Jamesone self-portraits and portraits of the Scottish aristocracy, as well as some imagined portraits of heroes of Scotland&#x27;s past. There are three portraits by Jamesone&#x27;s talented pupil John Michael Wright and ten aristocratic portraits by Sir John Baptist Medina, the last &quot;King&#x27;s Painter&quot; before the Acts of Union 1707.

The display &quot;Blazing with Crimson: Tartan Portraits&quot; (until December 2013) concentrates on portraits featuring tartan, which begin to be painted in the late 17th century, at that time apparently with no political connotations. The museum has one of the earliest examples, a full-length portrait of 1683 by John Michael Wright of Lord Mungo Murray, son of John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, wearing a belted plaid for hunting. The wearing of tartan was banned after the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, but reappears in grand portraits after a few decades, before becoming ever more popular with Romanticism and the works of Sir Walter Scott. Also wearing tartan is Flora MacDonald, painted by Richard Wilson in London after her arrest for helping Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape after the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion.

Scottish portrait painting flourished in the 18th century and Allan Ramsay and Sir Henry Raeburn are well represented with 13 and 15 works respectively, the former with many paintings of figures from the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as the recently acquired lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart, and the career of the latter extending into the 19th century with portraits of Walter Scott and others. The museum owns the iconic portrait of Robert Burns by Alexander Nasmyth. The largest number of works by a single artist is the 58 by the sculptor and gem-cutter James Tassie (1735–1799), who developed a distinctive format of large fired glass paste (or vitreous enamel) relief &quot;medallion&quot; portraits in profile, initially modelled in wax. His subjects include Adam Smith, James Beattie and Robert Adam. Adam disliked having his portrait taken but Tassie was a member of his social circle he did not refuse, with the result that, as with the Naysmyth portrait of Burns, almost all images of Smith derive from the exemplar in the museum.

The later 19th century in Scotland had no such dominant figures, but many fine artists, and saw the beginning of photography. The museum devotes a gallery to the photographs of Glasgow life taken by Thomas Annan, especially the images of slums taken in 1868–71, and in general the displays concentrate on the common people of Scotland. The collection continues to expand in the present day, with Scottish painters such as John Bellany (Peter Maxwell Davies, self-portrait and Billy Connolly) and John Byrne, whose works include images of himself, Tilda Swinton, Billy Connolly and Robbie Coltrane.

Other works in the collection include:

*James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, by Daniel Mytens
*Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton, by Oskar Kokoschka
*Winnie Ewing by Norman Edgar
*Alex Ferguson by David Mach
*Ian Wilmut by Wendy McMurdo
*Robin Jenkins by Jennifer McRae

<text>Rockity Roll was the third solo recording released by Mike Doughty after the breakup of his former band, Soul Coughing. It is a six-song EP which he recorded in New York City over two days in May 2003 at Pat Dillett&#x27;s tiny, windowless cubby at Kampo studios.

Everything on the record was recorded by Doughty: vocal, acoustic guitar, and programming done on a lo-fi Roland Groovebox.

The self-released version of &quot;Rockity Roll&quot; is out of print; it is currently available (with bonus tracks) as part of the &quot;Skittish / Rockity Roll&quot; two disc re-release.

<doc id="1133665" wikidata="Q795030" url="?curid=1133665" title="Brujeria (band)">
<text>Brujeria () is an American extreme metal band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1989. The band has Spanish lyrics with topics such as Satanism, anti-Christianity, sex, immigration, narcotics smuggling, and politics. Brujeria portrays Mexican imagery, with several members being Hispanic and Latino Americans, while the band&#x27;s name stands for &quot;brujería&quot; (Spanish for &quot;witchcraft&quot;). 

Brujeria alumni include Raymond Herrera, as well as Billy Gould, Nick Barker, Jeff Walker and Shane Embury. They perform under pseudonyms and portray themselves as a Latino band consisting of drug lords, concealing their identities due to being wanted by the FBI. In videos and photographs of the band, they are shown wearing bandanas, balaclavas, serapes, and are often shown wielding machetes.

==History==

===Formation and early releases (1989–1992)===
Brujeria was formed at a party in 1989 in the spirit of creating a grindcore and death metal band representative of the Latino/Chicano community. Its members, the guitarist Dino Cazares, Jello Biafra, drummer Pat Hoed, bass guitarist Billy Gould and vocalist Juan Brujo, used pseudonyms as most were in other known bands.

Their first single, &quot;¡Demoniaco!&quot;, was released in 1990. In 1992, &quot;Machetazos&quot; was released and with it came the band&#x27;s first line-up change. Jello Biafra departed the group, Pinche Peach was introduced as an additional vocalist and Raymond Herrera took on the drums; Pat Hoed, the band&#x27;s former drummer, became a second vocalist. &quot;Machetazos&quot; and &quot;El Patrón&quot; (1994) were produced and distributed through Jello Biafra&#x27;s record label Alternative Tentacles.

The band was criticized from its inception for its lyrics about drugs, sex and Satanism. These topics, while the subjects of many other death metal acts, were inspired by the actions of Adolfo Constanzo, Cuban-American-born Mexican drug smuggler, practitioner of Palo Mayombe and serial killer.

===&quot;Matando Güeros&quot; and controversy (1993–1994)===
Controversy was created by the cover of their first album &quot;Matando Güeros&quot; (1993), which featured a severed head being held by a hand. Subsequently, the image of the head would become an emblem of the band, transforming into their mascot known as &quot;Coco Loco&quot; (&quot;mad/crazy bogeyman&quot; or &quot;mad/crazy head&quot; in Mexican slang), and is seen frequently on album covers and merchandise. The severed head is of a drug dealer in a photo taken from a Mexican publication. This album saw the addition of Shane Embury on guitar and bass guitar.

===&quot;Raza Odiada&quot;, &quot;Marijuana&quot; and &quot;Spanglish 101&quot; (1995–1999)===
In 1995, they released their second full-length &quot;Raza Odiada&quot;, with the usual themes but with significant changes in their music and for many critics and fans their best work to date. &quot;Raza Odiada&quot; featured the single &quot;La Ley De Plomo&quot;, whose music video proved successful on music channels such as MTV, featuring late at night on heavy metal shows.

The group started to become increasingly popular, but nevertheless, decided to remain anonymous and declined all offers to organize concerts (except on rare occasions), confounding supporters, who were eager to see them live. Two years later came the EP &quot;Marijuana&quot;, featuring a cover-parody of the popular song &quot;The Macarena&quot; and four live songs from its first official concert.

1999 saw the release of &quot;Spanglish 101&quot;, a compilation of label Kool Arrow Records&#x27; artists, protesting against the dominance of English. On this album, the band released a couple of new tracks: &quot;Marcha de Odio&quot; which would later be included in their next album, &quot;Brujerizmo&quot; and &quot;Don Quijote Marijuana&quot;, cover of Magazine 60&#x27;s hit song Don Quixote, an issue that attracted attention for its techno-dance style, completely different from the band&#x27;s heavy metal sound.

===Commercial success with &quot;Brujerizmo&quot; and &quot;Mextremist Hits!&quot; (2000–2001)===
In 2000, 5 years after the last LP, Brujerizmo was released, which incorporated Nick Barker as a second drummer, Jesse Pintado on the guitar and Gaby Dominguez, as &quot;Pititis&quot;, who represents a female demon as the female vocalist.

The next release was a compilation, called &quot;Mextremist! Greatest Hits&quot;, released in 2001, which included classic tracks, alternate versions, remixes, a multimedia track with video, and some new themes, such as the collaboration with Mucho Muchacho on &quot;Narco-Peda&quot; and &quot;Asesino&quot; which featured Tony Campos of Static-X. The record, rather than being a compilation, was more like a disc of rarities and B-sides, since most of the songs were not the album versions, but the versions on the EPs and singles. The disc also included a video cover for the Magazine 60 song &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; named &quot;Don Quijote Marihuana&quot;.

===Hiatus and projects (2002–2006)===
2002 came with many plans for the band, first they went to record new material for their eagerly awaited fourth album. However, this seems to have been put on hold due to altercations between Cazares and Herrera related to the temporary breakup of Fear Factory. Herrera departed Brujeria in 2002, shortly before Fear Factory reformed without Cazares. The band then announced the launch of various side-projects for each of the band members, starting with Asesino who launched that same year, &quot;Corridos de Muerte&quot; with the band featuring Tony Campos and Emilio Marquez.

There is a DVD compilation of the band called &quot;Permission of Satan&quot;. This DVD was produced by Juan Brujo and Henry about the recording period of the &quot;Asesino&quot; album and videos of his first three presentations of the official tour of Brujeria, The Mexecutioner Tour. Also includes images of the addition of &quot;Wee Man&quot; Jason Acuña of &quot;Jackass&quot;, Satanico Army Band, Mariachi Terror, and others. The DVD was homemade and distributed by Juan Brujo.

Brujeria declined to do live performances in its early years, however, on June 11, 1997, they played at the Whisky a Go Go club in Hollywood. The short concert itself was incorporated into the EP &quot;Marijuana&quot; as a side B. On October 2, 2003, the band played its first official concert in Chicago, USA, and began its first tour known as The Mexecutioner Tour, which concluded on January 24, 2004 in Guadalajara, Mexico. Also in 2003, Roadrunner Records released a compilation of tracks from the studio albums, the band titled &quot;The Mexecutioner! - The Best of Brujeria&quot;. The band, now with Nick Barker on drums, decided to promote the work as the band had never done before, which included interviews, concerts and more. Starting with a second tour called &quot;Tour II&quot;, which began on February 7, 2004, in Mexicali and the first appearance of Pititis the female voice of the band, their first visit to Brazil and Argentina, concluding the tour on August 8, 2004 in Buenos Aires.

After that, the band was absent from the stage and uncertainty about the group&#x27;s future arose, it was speculated that the reason for this was that they were working on a new album but none materialized. Also during this period of time, several vital members of the group such as Dino Cazares, departed after alleged differences with frontman Juan Brujo. In an interview conducted to Fantasma in 2011, he revealed that Cazares departure was owed to his decision to participate in the Roadrunner United project in 2005, forcing the rest of the band to cancel their show at the annual Rock Al Parque Festival in Colombia, damaging the band&#x27;s reputation. In 2006, there was news from the band with the release of &quot;The Singles&quot; which is a revival of the EP and singles of the band and the beginning of a new global concert tour known as &quot;No Seas Pendejo Tour&quot; that began in Buenos Aires, Argentina on January 28 and also included the presentation in Vive Latino 2006 in Mexico featuring two new members: Tony Laureano on drums and Jeff Walker on bass. Shane Embury left bass and switched to guitar. At their first appearance in Europe Viña Rock, Spain, the tour concluded on 6 August of that year in Houston, Texas. Later, in September of that year, they returned to do a small tour in Spain known as &quot;Don Quijote Marijuana Tour&quot; now with Patrik Jensen on guitar and Adrian Erlandsson on drums.

===Reunion, &quot;Pocho Aztlan&quot;, &quot;Esto Es Brujeria&quot; and deaths (2007–present)===

After several years on hiatus, and internal problems, Brujeria reformed in 2007 and decided it was time to return to the scene. Juan Brujo (vocals), Pat Hoed (second vocals), Jeff Walker (bass), Shane Embury (guitar) and Adrian Erlandsson (drums) started a new tour called &quot;Weapon of Change Tour&quot;. Lasting from February 21 to December 15, the band performed in England, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. Between April and June 2008, Brujeria returned to Europe to play some concerts as an extension of the &quot;Weapon of Change Tour&quot;, including dates at SWR MetalFest XI in Barroselas (Portugal), again Viña Rock (Albacete, Spain) and in Kobetasonik, a rock festival that takes place in the Basque Country (Spain). In November and December of that year, the band began another tour called &quot;Accept No Imitations Tour&quot;. Brujeria played at the 10th annual Maryland Death Fest in May 2012.

They performed a world tour between 2007 and 2008. In an interview in June 2009, bassist Shane Embury stated that the band&#x27;s fourth studio album was going to be released that year, and that it could be released by the band itself. In October 2014, they signed with indie giant Nuclear Blast for an album in 2015. On July 1, 2016, the band announced that they would finally release their fourth studio album &quot;Pocho Aztlan&quot; on September 16. The album is their first in sixteen years, and their first to feature Hongo Jr., El Cynico, El Sangron and Cuernito.

Since the release of &quot;Pocho Aztlan&quot;, Brujeria has continued to tour regularly and released a series of one-off singles, including two anti-Trump songs &quot;Viva Presidente Trump!&quot; and &quot;Amaricon Czar&quot; (in 2016 and 2019 respectively), and &quot;Covid-666&quot; in 2020. The band had been working on new material by February 2022. On July 14, 2023, the band released their first single from their new album &quot;Esto Es Brujeria&quot; called &quot;Mochado&quot;. The album was released on September 15.

Pinche Peach died of heart failure on July 17, 2024, at the age of 57. On September 18, 2024, it was announced in a post from the band&#x27;s Instagram account that Juan Brujo died that morning, at the age of 61, due to a heart attack he had experienced on September 16, 2024, while taking a day off from their tour with Gwar. The band has since continued without Lepe.

<doc id="1133674" wikidata="Q1334304" url="?curid=1133674" title="Izumo no Okuni">
<text>was a Japanese entertainer and shrine maiden who is believed to have invented the theatrical art form of kabuki. She is thought to have begun performing her new art style of () theatre in the dry riverbed of the Kamo River in Kyoto. Okuni&#x27;s troupe quickly gained immense popularity, and were known for their performers, who were often lower-class women Okuni had recruited to act in her all-female theatre group.

Few concrete details are known about her life; born near Izumo Province, Okuni worked as a (shrine maiden) for several years at the Izumo-taisha (the Grand Shrine of Izumo) until gaining popularity for her dramatised dance performances, which onlookers gave the name of . Okuni continued to perform kabuki with her troupe until her retirement and disappearance sometime around 1610. She is believed to have died sometime around 1613.

==History==
===Early years===

Born , Okuni grew up in the vicinity of the Izumo shrine, where her father, Nakamura Sanemon, worked as a blacksmith, and where several other family members served. Eventually Okuni joined as a (shrine maiden), where she was known for her skill in dancing and acting, as well as her beauty. As it was a custom of the time to send priests, and others to solicit contributions for the shrine, she was sent to Kyoto to perform sacred dances and songs.

It was during her performances in Kyoto that she also became known for her performances of (or dance) in honor of the Amida Buddha. Though this dance traces its origins to Kūya, a 10th-century evangelist of Pure Land Buddhism, by Okuni&#x27;s time it had become a largely secular folk dance, and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its sultriness and sexual innuendo. Other popular themes for Okuni&#x27;s acts included humorous skits about lover&#x27;s trysts at various public establishments and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds wherever she performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call she ignored, though she continued to send money back.

===Founding of kabuki===
Around 1603, Okuni began performing on the dry riverbed of the Shijōgawara (Fourth Street Dry Riverbed) of the Kamo River and at Kitano Shrine. Okuni also performed for the ladies of the Imperial court. Gathering up the female outcasts and misfits of the region, particularly those involved in prostitution, Okuni gave them direction, teaching them acting, dancing and singing skills in order to form her troupe.

Several theories exist as to the etymology of the word &quot;kabuki&quot;, one being that it is derived from those who, oddly dressed and swaggering on the street, had been dubbed (from , &#x27;to lean in a certain direction&#x27;, and , &#x27;people&#x27;). Another possible origin is , which means &#x27;slanted&#x27; or &#x27;strongly-inclined.&#x27; In either case, others labelled Okuni&#x27;s troupe performances &quot;kabuki&quot; due to their eccentricity and social daring. The earliest performances of kabuki were dancing and song with no significant plot, often disdained as overly sexual and cacophonous, but equally lauded as colourful and beautiful.

Okuni&#x27;s troupe was exclusively female. Thus, she required her actresses to play both male and female roles. As her troupe gained fame, she was emulated by many others, particularly brothels, which offered such shows to amuse wealthy clients, as well as to gain prostitutes who had marketable acting and singing skills. This new style of exclusively female troupes became known by the alternative names of and , (from , the Japanese word for &#x27;woman&#x27; or &#x27;girl&#x27;) and .

===Later years===
One of Okuni&#x27;s most popular performances featured the romantic character of Nagoya Sansaburō, a real-life samurai who had died in 1603. Onstage, Okuni&#x27;s beautiful voice lured Sansaburō&#x27;s spirit back into the world of the living to dance with her. Despite historical speculation about the possible links between Okuni and Sansaburō, it remains uncertain whether the pair had ever been lovers during his lifetime, or whether she had simply incorporated him into her storytelling.

Okuni retired around 1610, and after that time she disappeared. In 1629, due to outcry for moral reform and concern about fights breaking out between men trying to win the attention of the actresses, Tokugawa Iemitsu forbade women from performing in kabuki. They were quickly replaced by young men as actors and &quot;actresses&quot;, though this was soon banned as well due to some of the same issues of prostitution and corruption of morals, restricting the performances to those by older men, which is a standing practice in the official theatres even today.

There are several conflicting theories of Okuni&#x27;s year of death; some say she died in 1610, others in 1613, or in 1640.

==Cultural impact and legacy==

In addition to her founding of kabuki, Okuni contributed to Japanese theatre as a whole. She is said to have introduced the forerunner of the (&#x27;path of flowers&#x27;), a runway leading from the rear of the theatre and crossing between the audience to the stage. This has been incorporated in several Japanese theatre arts beyond that of kabuki. In addition, she has also influenced modern musical theatre.

Ariyoshi Sawako published her novel in the late 1960s, crafting a fictional biography of the dancer. The story was first printed as a serial in from 1967 to 1969.

A commemorative statue of Izumo no Okuni is located in Kyoto by the Kamo River, not far from the Minami-za kabuki theatre.

<doc id="1133677" wikidata="Q884742" url="?curid=1133677" title="Log house">
<text>A log house, or log building, is a structure built with horizontal logs interlocked at the corners by notching. Logs may be round, squared or hewn to other shapes, either handcrafted or milled. The term &quot;log cabin&quot; generally refers to a smaller, more rustic log house, such as a hunting cabin in the woods, that may or may not have electricity or plumbing.

==History==
Log construction was the most common building technique in large regions of Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Baltic states and Russia, where straight and tall coniferous trees, such as pine and spruce, are readily available. It was also widely used for vernacular buildings in Eastern Central Europe, the Alps, the Balkans and parts of Asia, where similar climatic conditions prevail. In warmer and more westerly regions of Europe, where deciduous trees predominate, timber framing was favoured instead.

The two initial primary styles of log houses included:
*&quot;Sawn logs&quot;, which had logs sawn to a standard width but with their original heights.
*&quot;Milled&quot;, or machine-profiled, logs, made with a log house moulder and constructed with logs run through a manufacturing process, converting them into timbers consistent in size and appearance

Handcrafted log houses have been built for centuries in Fennoscandia, Fenno-Ugric areas such as Karelia, Lapland, Eastern parts of Finland. Also in Scandinavia, Russia and Eastern Europe, and were typically built using only an axe, knife and log scriber.

Settlers from northern Europe brought the craft of log cabin construction to North America in the early 17th century, where it was quickly adopted by other colonists and Native Americans. C. A. Nothnagle Log House, built in New Jersey circa 1640, is likely the oldest log cabin in the United States.

Pre-fabricated log houses for export were manufactured in Norway from the 1880s until around 1920 by three large companies: &quot;Jacob Digre&quot; in Trondheim, M. Thams &amp; Co. in Orkanger, and &quot;Strømmen Trævarefabrik&quot; at Strømmen. They were factory built from sawn or milled logs, numbered and dismantled for transportation, and reassembled on the buyer&#x27;s site. Buyers could order standard models from catalogs, custom-made houses designed by architects employed by the companies, or houses of their own design. Log houses from Thams were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris.

During the 1920s, the first American milled log houses appeared on the market, using logs which were pre-cut and shaped rather than hand-hewn. Many log houses today are of the milled variety, mainly because they require less labor-intensive field work than handcrafted houses. There are about 500 companies in North America which build the handcrafted, scribe-fit type of log house.

==Components==

The logs in log houses have a varying degree of moisture content; all logs have moisture when freshly cut. Handcrafted logs moisture will naturally leave the timber, drying it out until it stabilizes with its climate. This drying-out causes movement and shrinking of the log&#x27;s diameter. As logs and timbers dry, the differential shrinkage (radial versus tangential) causes small cracks (known as &quot;checks&quot;) to open slowly over time. Checking is a natural process in both air- and kiln-dried logs. This occurs in all log houses regardless of construction method or how the timber is allowed to dry, and is considered normal.

Milled logs are processed in a different manner from handcrafted logs. Logs destined to become milled logs may become one of several types, depending on the desired quality and results.

=== Green logs ===
Logs that are cut from the butt forest, brought to a mill or to a log-house construction yard, have their bark removed and are used to build a log-house shell, handcrafted log houses, or sent through profiling machines usually referred to as &quot;green&quot; logs if they have not been air- or kiln-dried. &quot;Green&quot; does not refer to color, but to moisture content. The actual moisture content of &quot;green&quot; logs varies considerably with tree species, the season in which it was cut, and whether sapwood or heartwood is being measured. Green logs may have a moisture content ranging from about 20% to 90%.

One type of air-dried log is &quot;dead standing,&quot; which refers to trees which have died from natural causes (bug kill, virus, fire etc.) and cut down after they died. Standing dead trees may be cut one month or several decades after they died, so the term &quot;dead standing&quot; does not necessarily mean the logs have dried down to equilibrium moisture content. Dead standing logs can be green, or more-or-less dry.

After construction, green logs dry in service in the log building. Within about four years, green logs which are part of a completed log house reach equilibrium with local conditions and have an equilibrium moisture content of between 6% and 12%, which varies by local climate, season and location.

=== Air-dried logs ===
Some log home companies let the fresh-cut logs (or milled timbers) sit outside in the open air to dry naturally. The timbers may be stacked with spacers (known as &quot;stickers&quot;) between them. This process allows the moisture content of the logs to naturally fall as the timber dries. In areas of high humidity, it may require as much as one year per inch of log thickness to dry. Arid climates may require less. A log with a diameter of 8 inches will usually reach equilibrium in about 18 months in the Rocky Mountains of North America. Air circulation is critical or the logs may begin to rot before properly drying, especially in humid regions. If the logs are to be dried to equilibrium with the local climate the process may take several years, depending on the location and size of the timbers. In some environments, the logs must be kept under some type of roof or cover to reduce the impact of rain storms on the drying process.

Once the logs have dried for the desired length of time, they are profiled prior to shipping. Profiling usually does not take place until shortly before shipment, to ensure that the logs stay as uniform as possible. It is uncertain whether this process is advantageous; it depends on many factors such as local climate, wood species, its size, and the location of the log structure.

=== Kiln-dried logs ===
Mills that have a kiln on site have the option of artificially accelerating the drying process. Green timber is placed inside a large oven, where heat removes moisture from them; however, they can suffer severe checking and cracking if the kiln controls are not properly monitored during the drying process. Use of a kiln can reduce the drying time from many months to several weeks. Kiln-drying usually results in an average moisture content of 18-20% (&quot;average&quot; means the average moisture content of the outside and the center of the log).

In North America, logs reach equilibrium moisture content at about 6% and 12%; since most kiln-dried logs are dried down to about 18% to 20% moisture content, kiln-dried logs can be expected to shrink and settle over time, but to a lesser extent than green logs.

=== Glue-laminated timber ===
&quot;Laminated&quot; or &quot;engineered&quot; logs are a different approach to log-house building. Full trees or (alternatively) sawn cants (unfinished logs to be further processed) are brought to a mill with a dry kiln, the bark is removed and the trees are sawn into boards usually no more than two inches thick. These boards are then taken to the dry kiln, where (because of their size) they can be dried without causing severe damage to the wood. Timber destined for glue lamination must be brought down below 15% moisture before the lamination process will work, so typically these timbers are dried to around 8-10% moisture. The drying process varies on the species of lumber, but can be done in as little as a week. Once the drying process is complete the planks are sent through a surfacer (or planer), which makes the face of the lumber perfectly smooth. These planks travel to a machine, which then spreads a special glue on the interior boards. Now there are also Non-Settling log profiles available.
Depending on the type of glue and type of mill, there are two ways to finish the lamination process. One type of glue reacts with radio-frequency (RF) energy to cure the glue in minutes; the other uses a high-pressure clamp, which holds the newly reassembled timbers under pressure for 24 hours. Once the glue has dried, the result is a &quot;log cant&quot; that is slightly larger than the buyer&#x27;s desired profile. These log cants are run through a profiler, and the end result is a log that is perfectly straight and uniform. Some mills are capable of joining together small timbers by using a combination of face and edge gluing and a process known as finger- jointing. Boards which would be scrap at another mill may be used in the center of a laminated log or beam to minimize waste.

=== Types of milled logs ===
Milled log homes employ a variety of profiles, which are usually specified by the customer:

* &quot;D-shape logs&quot;: round on the outside and flat inside 
* &quot;Full-round logs&quot;: fully round inside and out 
* &quot;Square logs&quot;: flat inside and out, and may be milled with a groove which could be chinked. When dealing with milled logs, chinking is a personal preference and not required to seal a house; however, a log house will eventually leak if it is not properly sealed.
* &quot;Swedish Cope logs&quot;: round inside and out, with a half-moon-shaped groove on the bottom

Nearly every profiled log on the market features an integral tongue and groove milled into the top and bottom of the log; this aids in stacking and reduces the need for chinking. Wood is not airtight, but caulking or chinking improves energy efficiency.

== Construction methods ==

*&quot;Scandinavian Full-Scribe&quot;, also known as the &quot;chinkless method&quot;, is naturally-shaped, smoothly-peeled (drawknifed) logs which are scribed and custom-fitted to one another. They are notched where they overlap at the corners, and there are several ways to notch the logs.
*In the &quot;flat-on-flat&quot; method, logs are flattened on the top and bottom and then stacked (usually with butt-and-pass corners).
*&quot;Milled log houses&quot; are constructed with a tongue-and-groove system which helps align one log to another and creates a system to seal out the elements.
*With the &quot;tight-pinned butt and pass&quot; method, the logs are not notched or milled in any way. They are in a single course and do not overlap; vertical pairs of logs are fastened with tight, load-bearing steel pins.

=== Corner styles ===




* &quot;Interlocking saddle notch&quot;: Normally seen on D- or full-round profiles, where a notch is cut into the top of one log and the bottom of another; these two logs then interlock, creating a tightly-sealed corner. Also popular in handcrafted, full-scribe log houses.

* &quot;Dovetail&quot;: Typically seen on square, hewn, or chink-style logs. A dovetail joint is cut on the end of a log, where it would rest in a corner—one to the right and one to the left; this creates a tight, interlocking corner. Handcrafted dovetails can be full dovetail with notch surface slopes in two directions simultaneously, or half dovetail with notch surface slopes in one direction.
* &quot;Locked&quot; or &quot;Tooth-edged&quot; joint: Typically seen in square logs. A lock joint is where distinct tooth-like profiles are cut at the end of each log for a tight &quot;locked&quot; fit.
* &quot;Butt-and-pass&quot;: Unscribed (or milled) logs butt up against each other at the corners without notching
* &quot;Saddle notch&quot;: Used where two round logs overlap each other near the corners; common with the Swedish cope profile
* &quot;Vertical corner post&quot; also known as post-and-plank: Typically larger (e.g., 8&quot; x 8&quot;) than the wall logs (e.g., 6&quot; x 6&quot;). The wall logs would be &quot;toe nailed&quot; into the corner post.
* &quot;Mortise and Tenon Joinery&quot;: the tenon (tongue) of one log connects to the mortise (hole) of another forming a 90-degree angle to secure the joint.

=== Other methods ===

* &quot;Half-Log&quot;: The structure is built with conventional building techniques, and &quot;half-log&quot; siding is applied to the exterior and interior walls to replicate the look of full-log construction. Some half-log sidings may also have saddle notch, butt-and-pass, or dovetail corners to give a more realistic appearance.
* &quot;Palisade style&quot;: The logs are standing on end, and are either pinned or bolted together.
* &quot;Pièce en pièce&quot; or &quot;pièce sur pièce&quot;. Similar to post-and-plank above: Uses short logs (e.g. 8&#x27; long) lying horizontally between upright posts, resembling post-and-beam construction (but usually lacking the complex notching seen with post-and-beam). &quot;Pièce en pièce&quot; typically uses a large (8&quot;x 8&quot;) vertical corner post. It is important that a vertical component (often 3&quot;x 6&quot;) be placed on both sides of each window and door.
* A unique house type in the Oberlausitz region where Germany, Upper Lusatian house or Umgebinde in German. Part of the ground floor has log walls inside the posts of a timber frame.

=== Settling ===
Once fabricated and assembled, the shell of the log house may be disassembled and the parts shipped to the building site. This allows for centralized manufacturing of the house, and relatively quick construction on site. Full-scribe-fit handcrafted log construction is a method of precisely marking where to cut each individual wall log to provide a tight fit between naturally-shaped logs along their entire length and in the corners. A high degree of craftsmanship is required for success in this method, and the resulting tight fit of naturally-shaped logs have aesthetic appeal.

Log houses which settle require slip joints over all window and door openings, adjustable jacks under vertical elements (such as columns and staircases) which must periodically be adjusted as the building settles, allowances in plumbing, wiring, and ducting runs, and fasteners for the walls themselves to prevent .

<doc id="1133682" wikidata="Q2919166" url="?curid=1133682" title="Friend of Dorothy">
<text>A &quot;friend of Dorothy&quot; (FOD) is a code word for a gay man, first used in LGBTQ slang. Stating that, or asking if someone is a &quot;friend of Dorothy&quot;, is a furtive way of suggesting sexual orientation while avoiding hostility. The term was likely based on the character Dorothy Gale of the &quot;Oz&quot; series of novels, which have been interpreted as including much queer subtext. Actress Judy Garland, who portrayed Dorothy in the 1939 &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; film, is considered a gay icon. Writer and critic Dorothy Parker is thought to be another potential origin of the term. The &quot;friend of Dorothy&quot; code word was commonly used throughout the 20th century, but its use has declined in recent decades as LGBT acceptance has advanced.

== Dorothy from &quot;Oz&quot; and Judy Garland ==

=== Dorothy from &quot;Oz&quot; ===
The precise origin of the term is unknown. Some believe that it is derived from &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909), a sequel to the first novel, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). The book introduces readers to Polychrome who, upon meeting Dorothy&#x27;s travelling companions, exclaims, &quot;You have some queer friends, Dorothy&quot;, and she replies, &quot;The queerness doesn&#x27;t matter, so long as they&#x27;re friends.&quot; There are numerous references to LGBTQ characters and relationships, including a possible innuendo about bisexuality – when Dorothy asks Scarecrow which way to go on the yellow-brick road he says, &quot;Of course some people go both ways&quot; – although it is unknown whether they were intentionally included. For instance, in a case that may be seen as changing gender identity, or being transgender, Ozma, while still an infant, the baby daughter of the former King Pastoria of Oz, was given to the witch Mombi of the North by the Wizard of Oz. Mombi transformed Ozma into a boy and called him &quot;Tip&quot; (short for Tippetarius) in order to prevent the rightful ruler of Oz from ascending to the throne. Thus, Ozma spent her entire childhood with Mombi in the form of the boy Tip, and had no memory of ever having been a girl. Later, Princess Ozma would be the ruler of the fictional land of Oz. Princess Ozma has been referred to as “one of the first transgender characters in literature.&quot; This storyline was revived in the TV show &quot;Emerald City&quot; (2017).

===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;===
More commonly, it is stated that &quot;friend of Dorothy&quot; refers to the derivative 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; because Judy Garland, who starred as the main character Dorothy, is a gay icon. In the film, Dorothy is accepting of those who are different. For example, the &quot;gentle lion&quot; giving the line, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s no denyin&#x27;, I&#x27;m just a dandy lion.&quot; &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; has a &quot;particular resonance in the culture of the queer community&quot;. The struggles faced by Dorothy, Toto, and friends, especially against the Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys can metaphorically mirror the difficulties of coming out. How the group of outcasts worked together likewise mirrors LGBTQ people who create new chosen families. Researchers also note there is an absence of a heteronormative male–female romance, and Dorothy and her friends &quot;do not need to change themselves to become who they want to be&quot;. Many see Garland&#x27;s portrayal as a &quot;queer journey, an escape from the puritanical, morally rigid, black-and-white small-town life to Technicolor city existence with fabulous friends&quot;.

Additionally relevant is the classic song &quot;(Somewhere) Over the Rainbow&quot; that Dorothy (Judy Garland) sings, which was possibly &quot;the most memorable performance&quot; of Garland&#x27;s career, and the song &quot;contributed to the evolution of the rainbow flag as a gay icon&quot;. The song &quot;act[ed] as a cultural catalyst, propelling the eventual embrace of the rainbow symbol by the world&#x27;s LGBTQ communities&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in its August 18, 1967, review of Garland&#x27;s final engagement at New York&#x27;s Palace Theatre, observed: &quot;A disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual. The boys in the tight trousers roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats, particularly when Judy sings [&#x27;Over the Rainbow&#x27;].&quot;

=== Judy Garland ===

LGBTQ people could also empathize with the personal struggles of Judy Garland, as a persecuted people they identified with suffering. Garland&#x27;s problems, &quot;the drinking and divorcing, all the pills and all the men, all the poundage come and gone&quot;, were documented in the media. She was among the first stars to have her &quot;dirty laundry&quot; aired publicly. She was the &quot;archetype of the triumphant/tragic diva, paving the way for the stormy trajectories of superstars Elizabeth Taylor, Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, and Lindsay Lohan&quot;. Biographer Gerald Clarke thinks she was likely bipolar, &quot;explaining her many suicide attempts and use of alcohol and pills to self-medicate.&quot; Her mental health problems were likely related to childhood trauma, possibly untreated complex PTSD, a common shared experience with LGBTQ+ people. In the face of these challenges she pressed forward, &quot;explaining her enduring popularity among LGBTQ fans&quot;. She also endured &quot;self-doubts about her capabilities, suffered crippling stage fright&quot;, yet beamed on stage. Onstage &quot;she &#x27;came out&#x27;, expressing through her skills the real person she was meant to be&quot;. LGBTQ people notice this, &quot;admiring her courage and resilience, adopting it as their own&quot;. One psychiatrist&#x27;s explanation: &quot;Judy was beaten up by life, embattled and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her.&quot;

Gay men, particularly older ones, were among her biggest fans:

According to United Press International&#x27;s Marilyn Malara, &quot;In the 1950s and 1960s, Garland acted as an unofficial mascot for a generation of gay men, who flocked to Garland&#x27;s many performances, referring to themselves as &#x27;friends of Dorothy.&#x27;&quot;

In September 2019, in reporting on the resurgence of interest in Garland due to the biopic &quot;Judy&quot; starring Renée Zellweger, Louis Staples analyzed Garland&#x27;s story, to &quot;understand how and why some gay men look to famous women to help them navigate the world.&quot; Both Dorothy and Garland are taken from ordinary lives into the spectacular, LGBTQ people perceiving themselves as abnormal, different, or &quot;other&quot; could relate to not being ordinary. Once in the Hollywood movie business, Garland&#x27;s body was a battleground for never being sexy enough, or slim enough; LGBTQ people can relate to dealing with &quot;body dysmorphia, harm[ing] their bodies, attempt[ing] suicide and suffer from eating disorders.&quot; Richard Dyer argues that, after her artistic success in, but commercial failure of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1954) &quot;Garland&#x27;s work and life tells a story of survival, and of someone trying to assert some form of control in a world that was set up to destroy her.&quot;

Garland also had a number of gay men in her life including her father Frank Gumm who &quot;preferred the company of very young men&quot;. There was speculation for years in the entertainment community that her second husband Vincente Minnelli was gay or bisexual. A biography, &quot;Vincente Minnelli: Hollywood&#x27;s Dark Dreamer&quot;, claims he lived as an openly gay man in New York prior to his arrival in Hollywood, where the town pressured him back into the closet. According to the biographer: &quot;He was openly gay in New York – we were able to document names of companions and stories from Dorothy Parker. But when he came to Hollywood, I think he made the decision to repress that part of himself or to become bisexual.&quot; Garland&#x27;s fourth husband, Mark Herron, was gay and in a long-lasting relationship with fellow actor Henry Brandon, which was only briefly interrupted by his marriage to Garland. The two men remained together until Brandon&#x27;s death in 1990. Garland&#x27;s daughter Liza Minnelli&#x27;s first husband, Peter Allen, was discovered by Herron while Allen was performing in Hong Kong. Garland took the act, the Allen Brothers, under her care becoming manager and booking agent, and had them open her concerts in Britain and the United States. Garland also introduced Allen to her daughter, but Allen was having affairs with men before the marriage; he later came out as gay.

Garland&#x27;s death (June 22, 1969), and funeral held in New York City, happened days before the Stonewall Riots, the spark that started the modern LGBTQ rights movement, took place, although reports are that the riots were spontaneous and not related to her passing.

== Dorothy Parker ==
Predating &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; origins of the phrase (although not connected to the L. Frank Baum novels) is New York City&#x27;s celebrated humorist, critic and &quot;defender of human and civil rights&quot; Dorothy Parker, whose social circles in the 1920s and 1930s included gay men. The two origin stories are not mutually exclusive; both could be somewhat true depending on how one learned of the phrase, or even separately where it derived. The socialite would throw &quot;famous parties at Garden of Allah&#x27;s lavish celebrity villas&quot;, gay men would use the phrase for entry. Prohibition in the United States from 1920 to 1933, when social alcohol consumption was generally illegal, prompted all forms of illegal activities to circumvent the ban, including the speakeasies during the Roaring Twenties, also known as the Jazz Age. Parker would invite gay men, who would in turn invite other gay men to her gatherings using the code phrase to gain entry. Parker had many gay fans, and was well known for her quick wit and use of sarcasm as well as social activism. 

Official bans on gays serving in the military first surfaced in the early 20th century. The U.S. introduced a ban in a revision of the Articles of War of 1916 and the UK first prohibited homosexuality in the Army and Air Force Acts in 1955. During World War II (1940s) many U.S. and British servicemen started meeting and forming friendships while serving in Europe. In conversation and in letter writing, phrases like &quot;simply divine&quot;, &quot;fabulous&quot; and &quot;nelly&quot; began to be used by men, who later brought its use back to the United States. By the 1960s and onward the social stigma of being gay was slowly lifting, including the Stonewall Riots in 1969 which launched the modern LGBTQ rights movement, and the phrase was no longer needed as much.

== Usage ==

Starting in the late 1980s, on several cruise lines, gay and lesbian passengers began approaching ship staff, asking them to publicise gatherings in the daily cruise activity list. As the cruise lines were hesitant to announce such things so blatantly in their daily publications, they would list the gathering as a &quot;Meeting of the Friends of Dorothy&quot;. The use of this phrase likely comes from the cruise directors who were also familiar with and using the &quot;Friends of Bill W.&quot; phrase in their programs to tell members of Alcoholics Anonymous that there were support group meetings on the trip.

In recent years the use of FOD on cruise ships has largely been replaced by LGBTQ Gathering/Meetup, or PRIDE Gathering/Meetup. 

Such meetings have expanded in popularity and frequency over the years. Now, many cruise lines will have multiple FOD events, sometimes as many as one each night. Despite this, many FOD meetings have low turnout rates.

== Misunderstanding ==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Naval Investigative Service (NIS), the predecessor to the modern-day Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) was investigating homosexuality in the Chicago area. Agents discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as &quot;friends of Dorothy&quot;. Unaware of the historical meaning of the term, the NIS believed that there actually &quot;was&quot; a woman named Dorothy at the center of a massive ring of homosexual military personnel, so they launched an enormous and futile hunt for the elusive &quot;Dorothy&quot;, hoping to find her and convince her to reveal the names of gay service members.

== &quot;Friend of Mrs. King&quot; ==
Similar to &quot;friend of Dorothy&quot; is &quot;friend of Mrs. King&quot; (i.e., Queen, in the meaning of &quot;gay man&quot;). This was used in England, mostly in the first half of the 20th century.

<doc id="1133683" wikidata="Q6377995" url="?curid=1133683" title="Katrina and the Waves 2">
<text>Katrina and the Waves 2 is the second album by new wave band Katrina and the Waves, released in 1984 (see 1984 in music). The album was originally only released in Canada on the Attic Records label. It was included on the 2003 compilation &quot;The Original Recordings 1983–1984&quot;, and also re-released with five bonus tracks in 2010 through the CGB label. Six of the album&#x27;s songs would be reworked for the band&#x27;s major label debut &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot;.

The album outtake &quot;That&#x27;s Just the Woman in Me&quot; was covered by Celine Dion in 2007 on her &quot;Taking Chances&quot; album.

==Reception==

Mark Deming, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, noted that the band had added a lot of &quot;studio polish&quot; to their sound on &quot;Katrina and the Waves 2&quot;. He wrote, &quot;This was a good and a bad thing; the glossier production allows some of the finer details of Kimberley Rew&#x27;s songwriting and guitar work to come to the surface, but the additional backing vocals, keyboards, and horns also clutter arrangements that had been lean and straightforward on their earlier recordings, and drummer Alex Cooper was asked to share percussion duties with a LinnDrum here, and as a result the music sounds stiffer and less energetic.&quot; Deming also noted that Rew, on tracks like &quot;Cry for Me&quot; and &quot;The Game of Love&quot;, explored a &quot;retro-styled pop sound that gave the recording a new twist.&quot;

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that, compared to the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Katrina and the Waves 2&quot; &quot;takes a harder-rocking bent, downplaying the tunefulness slightly to highlight jumping numbers like &quot;She Loves to Groove,&quot; the nutty &quot;Maniac House&quot; and a powerful, Janis Joplin-like blues, &quot;Cry for Me.&quot; They concluded that the album was &quot;not as glorious as the debut, but a boss record nonetheless.&quot;

==Reissue==
&quot;Katrina and the Waves 2&quot; was reissued in 2010 on the CGB label in a limited edition of 1000 copies, each individually numbered. It includes previously unreleased material and all tracks have been remastered from the original master tapes. The booklet includes detailed recording credits, band interviews, rare photos, and liner notes by former Attic Records employee Ralph Alfonso, who got the band signed to the label in 1983.

==Track listing==
;Note
&quot;Yes Agatha&quot; was recorded at Kimberley Rew&#x27;s Remote Farm Studios, Cambridge in 1991. According to Rew, &quot;recorded in what seemed like a novelty style at the time, but which actually makes it sound more like the earlier stuff.&quot;

He is best known for his great success in hillclimbing, having won the British Hillclimb Championship on four occasions (1975, 1976, 1992, and 1996) in a career spanning more than three decades. Lane won 90 individual rounds of the championship, a record equaled by Martin Groves in July 2009.

Lane still holds the course record at Curborough sprint track; 26.84 secs in his Pilbeam MP58-09 4 litre DFL since 21 April 1996, where he was almost invincible. In the 1990s, his partnership with the Pilbeam constructor was one of the most successful in the sport.

The back problems which troubled Lane for many years kept his appearances to a minimum in recent seasons, although he still competed on occasion, and continued to be competitive in sprinting. He made a full return to hillclimbing in 2006, at the wheel of a Porsche 911.

Lane was formerly chief instructor at the Prescott Hillclimb Drivers School.

Roy Lane died of peritonitis on 14 October 2009.

<text>is a manga series drawn by Mineko Ohkami and published in the monthly Japanese magazine &quot;Wings&quot;. The manga was licensed in the United States by Tokyopop. The Tokyopop translation is imported to Australia by Madman Entertainment.

The sequel &quot;Heavenly Black and Evil White: Dragon Knights 2&quot; follows 500 years after the original story and it is currently ongoing since 2014.

==Characters==

===Dragon Knights===
;Rath Illuser:The Dragon Knight of Fire. One of his favorite hobbies is killing demons, and will go out of his way to seek them out. He uses the Fire Dragon sword, and later the Light Dragon Sword, as his weapon. He also boasts Ice and Fire magic and a strange ability to create temporary copies of himself and absorb others&#x27; powers, along with special ties to the Light Dragon. It is now known that he wasn&#x27;t the true Dragon Knight of Fire. Rath harbors a great amount of self-hate, frequently projecting this hatred onto others. In volume 19, he also nearly commits suicide by Thatz&#x27;s Earth Dragon Sword. It takes a special person and a lot of effort to break through his many masks. He is also the only heir to the Dragon Lord. He is somehow related to the Demon Lord and believes that he shouldn&#x27;t be living. Cesia and Rune are those that Rath acts naturally around. When he and Cesia travel together to look for a way to revive Crewger, Rath&#x27;s demon dog, he begins to develop feelings for Cesia. He would do anything to save her from the many demons that are after her.

:Rath used to be an evil spirit that had possessed the dead body of the Dragon dog, Illuser. Ace used his blood to turn it into one of the Dragon Tribe. After going to Nadil&#x27;s castle to rescue Lii with Rune and Thatz, Rath is captured and Cesia releases all the souls that were held inside of Rath, most notably Gil and Bierrez, and Rath disappears. It is unknown whether or not Rath is dead at this point, and the story seems to indicate that Cesia will bring him back again at some later point.

:When Cesia finally revives Rath once more, he goes back to Nadil&#x27;s castle where Nadil reveals that Rath is the Demon King. This finally explains Karl&#x27;s inexplicable loyalty to Rath and Rath&#x27;s ability to continually return to life in different bodies. Rath uses Rakeita, the magical gun, with the help of the Dragon lord and Dragon empress&#x27; dragon eyes. In the end, Rath and Cesia become the Dragon Lord and Queen. In the sequel &quot;Heavenly Black and Evil White&quot;, he and Cesia have three children; plays the important role as well

;Rune:The Dragon Knight of Water, an elfin prince. He gave up his elfin powers when he became a dragon knight, and spent much time trying to recover them. He is incredibly focused, and seems to hold the current mission above all else in his priorities. He uses the Water Dragon sword as his weapon, although he can also harness the Power of Varawoo (a demon fish) and the purifying elfin power of Virtue. Although none of his friends tend to remember, Rune is also in love with and married to the elfin princess, Tintlet. He also resembles a girl, as noted by Rath and Thatz. He becomes the next White Dragon Officer in the end.

;Thatz:(or in the original Japanese version, That&#x27;s) The Dragon Knight of Earth, a human. He was originally a thief before he awoke the Earth Dragon while trying to steal its seal from the Dragon palace. He still has a weakness for treasure and food. He uses the Earth Dragon sword as his weapon and, unlike the other two Knights, has no extra powers. In one of his battles against the Fire Demon Fedelta, he lost his left arm. Thatz, while coming off lighthearted, lazy, and even immature at times, cares deeply for Rath and Rune and tries hard to keep them both from harm—both external and self-inflicted. He becomes the next Blue Dragon Officer in the end.

===Leading ladies===
;Cesia:A part-Yokai whom the Dragon Knights accidentally &quot;rescued&quot; from a witch. She can control wind magic and amplifies the powers of others who are near her. Her power amplification is one of the most sought after skills by both the Dragon Tribe and the Demon armies, and she has found herself to be of surprising worth. Cesia uses the Wind Staff both as a weapon and an object of healing—Although she has yet to unlock all of its secrets. She is one of the few who can get through to Rath and the person he feels the most comfortable around, as they share many aspects in their pasts. Cesia promises Rath that she would be the one to save him as she cares deeply for Rath.In volume 25 she eventually saves Rath and in doing so Rath and Cesia share a &quot;Hello&quot; kiss as Rath calls it. Cesia is a psychologically strong character, although she is also fighting her own inner demons which come not only in the more traditional forms of self-doubt and fear, but her Yokai side as well. She is very susceptible to curses. In the end, she becomes the new Dragon Queen.

;Kitchel:A human thief like Thatz, she used to be his rival when they were both scraping a living on the streets. She stole all of Thatz&#x27;s money and food when she got a job working for Lord Lykouleon, actually forcing Thatz to sneak into the castle and eventually become a Dragon Knight. She is currently enlisted as a treasure hunter for the Dragon Lord. Very upbeat and cheerful, Kitchel prides herself on both her ability to always look on the bright side and for still being the best thief around. She managed to find the Three Treasures.

;Tintlet:The elfin princess and wife of Rune, Tintlet holds a surprising amount of power. Appearing at first glance to be no more than a delicate addition to the cast, her elfin powers are quite strong. Very adept at healing and purifying magic, Tintlet can also &quot;kick butt&quot; when riled. She has the ability to change her form into that of a young human-looking girl and so be able to better traverse the countryside without giving away her true identity. In addition, Tintlet is able to split her body and soul, an ability that has already proven useful multiple times. A deeply loving and understanding character, Tintlet, although remaining largely unseen until the (after a brief appearance in the sixth and thirteenth) fifteenth book, has quickly shown her worth and ability to handle all thrown at her. She is caring of others, especially for the Elfin race.

===Dragon Lord and consort===
;Lord Lykouleon:The Dragon Lord, and previous Light Dragon Knight. He is a powerful fighter and an empathetic caretaker of the people, but is constantly being kept in the castle by his underlings. He feels responsible for Rath&#x27;s troubles and hurt by Rath&#x27;s inability to see eye-to-eye with him. His blood is poisonous to most people, being described like an &quot;overdose of light medicine&quot;. He uses the Imperial Dragon Sword as his weapon, although Rath currently has this in his possession. Lykouleon takes all under his wing, welcoming humans, yokai, and elves alike into the Dragon castle. Except for Rath, his blood brother, he is the last of the royal line. By the end of the series, he dies and his soul helps Rath level the magic gun at Nadil. It is believed that he was the sacrifice Nadil was talking about, in order for Rath to retain his dragon powers as he shot Nadil.

;Lady Raseleane:The consort to the Dragon Lord, Lady Raseleane is Lykouleon&#x27;s beloved wife. Greatly popular among the Dragon Tribe, she is a nurturing mother to all within the walls. Lady Raseleane was captured by Lord Nadil when the demons invaded Draqueen for the first time, prompting the start of the poor (to say the least) diplomatic relations between Kainaldia and Draqueen. She was eventually rescued by Lord Lykouleon, but not before Nadil had removed her Dragon Eyes (greatly stunting her ability to foretell the future and use magic) and rendered her unable to bear the Dragon Lord an heir. Nadil tries to kidnap her after he is revived and Rath dies. Lykouleon saves her. After the Dragon Lord dies, she secludes herself and Cenozurna in a mountain mansion. She also tells Rath, the new Dragon Lord, that he and Lykouleon are one. In the sequel, she has a son named, Naatsu, one of the main protagonists.

===Dragon officers===
;Alfeegi:The White Dragon Officer and Secretary, Alfeegi takes upon himself much of the responsibility for the every day affairs in the palace. He often scolds Ruwalk, Kaistern, Lykouleon and the three Knights for not finishing their work on time or giving extra money to Kaistern on his trips and such. As well as the castle finances, Alfeegi is in charge of their fortunetellers, placing Cesia under his care. Alfeegi has fantastic intuition and a keen mind, and although it seems like he enjoys yelling, he cares for all the Dragons very much. He was killed by Rath (who was possessed by Nadil at the time) in book 11. He returns in the latest book with the death faery, though unseen by any of the inhabitance of the Dragon Castle. It is assumed that he is either a ghost or a death faery now. He also visits Draqueen in the end, before Lykouleon dies, with Reema and Duuma. At that time, he instructs Saabel - whose soul was separated from his body and Alfeegi was talking to Saabel&#x27;s soul - to find the Diamond Clover, a powerful dragon/monster that can defeat Yuusurgi. He is married to Reema, the death fairy.

;Ruwalk:The Yellow Dragon Officer, Ruwalk acts as the Dragon Lord whenever Lykouleon cannot. He is childish and mischievous, but fights hard to protect the Dragon Tribe. Ruwalk has a tendency to give extra money to Kaistern for his frequent trips and help Lord Lykouleon slip out of the castle unnoticed. Always one to stand up for those trying to slide around the various castle formalities, he tends to get in trouble with Alfeegi quite often. He is Lykouleon&#x27;s childhood friend and most of the time calls him by his given name without the title of &quot;Lord&quot;: Ruwalk is Lykouleon&#x27;s closest confidant and one of the few who are close enough to him to give him blunt advice or help. Ruwalk was also the one who chose to keep &quot;Illuser&quot; [&quot;Eryusa&quot; in Japanese] as Rath&#x27;s last name. He and Cenozurna are paired up at the end.

;Kaistern:The Blue Dragon Officer, Kaistern travels around the world as a diplomat with other countries on the continent of Dusis. He is the closest to Rath and the Dragon/Demon dog Crewger, taking Crewger along on several of his trips. He has spent the last several years searching for the mystical Wind Dragon in a desperate effort to save Rath, whom he cares deeply for, acting as a joint mentor-father-therapist for the Knight of Fire. Kaistern would (and, indeed, does) lay everything on the line for Rath, and although he is the only one who Rath tells everything to, he never truly is let in by the Knight, no matter how hard he has tried to be accepted. After being poisoned by demon water, he gives up his lifeforce to help resurrect Rath. (He died in book 12, after being poisoned in an earlier book.)

;Tetheus:The Black Dragon Officer and in charge of security and of overseeing the Dragon Fighters and Knights, Tetheus does a commendable job to protect the Dragon Castle from harm. Brother to Shydeman and Shyrendora, meaning that he is a demon, he was rescued by Lykouleon and vowed to serve him. Dark, mysterious and incredibly strong, not much is known about his past or, in reality, his present. Tetheus isn&#x27;t as harsh as he sometimes comes off, however, and while he can be very strict, is also protective to a fault, loyal, and with the uncanny ability to see far more than he reveals. He was able to kill his brother, Shydamen, and become a full dragon. He also, as he was fighting off Shydamen, reinforced Saabel&#x27;s soul&#x27;s instructions to find Diamond Clover. He and Kitchel are paired up in the end.

===Historian===
;Cernozura:In charge of the castle maids and other lower staff, Cernozura has recently taken up the post of castle historian as well. Renowned for her culinary skills, Cernozura is a favorite of the younger members of the castle and a close friend and lady-in-waiting to Lady Raseleane. Often seen nursing the hurts (both major and minor) of the Dragon Clan, Cernozura is dutiful and friendly, and also a self-admitted romantic. She finds hope in reading into peoples&#x27; interactions and uncovering the latent feelings below.

===Nadil&#x27;s army===
;Nadil:The Demon Lord, arch-enemy of Lord Lykouleon. He was decapitated, but his armies still scour the land. Long ago, he worked with the Dragon Lord but betrayed him to lead his demonic forces. He was the true Dragon Knight of Wind, but consumed the Wind Dragon to gain power and further his own means. Ruthless and cruel, Nadil desires Cesia&#x27;s power as well in order to strengthen his weakened, but by no means minute, forces. He harbors secret ties to Rath Illuser and is capable of possessing his body on occasion and wreaking havoc through him. While his exact plans are largely unknown to all by himself, Nadil&#x27;s motives are clear: control of all three lands of Kainaldia, Dusis, and Arinas.

;Shydeman and Shyrendora:Shyrendora is the younger twin sister of Shydeman. They share a single joined soul, making it so that if one of them dies, the other will as well. She was separated from her older siblings, Shydeman and Tetheus, when they were separated in a great war between the Dragon Lord and Demon Lord. She followed Shydeman when he chose to side with Nadil in order to gain new powers and to save each other from death. She has a hot temper, is easily agitated, and thinks of people as objects. Shyrendora is devoted to Nadil and is extremely distressed whenever his life is in danger. She is fairly amused by Sabel, and she finds pleasure in agitating him as well as the other lesser demons. Shydeman is the older twin brother of Shyrendora. He nearly died in the battle between the Dragon Lord and Demon Lord. Believing that Tetheus had died and while he himself was rendered weak, Shydeman joined with Nadil to receive enough power to make up for his lacking past. His strength grew and his lust for power grew with it, making him as power-hungry as Nadil. Just like his sister, he likes to control people {i.e. Gil} and show others that he is not to be toyed with. Shydeman cares nothing for Tetheus, deciding that anyone who joins the Dragon Tribe must be an enemy. He is smart and calm through most situations, and is careful to think before taking action. He has, oddly enough, formed a relatively open bond with the Fire demon Fedelta, promoting him to work directly under him and carry out his specific commands.

;Fedelta:Fedelta is a Fire yokai and Shydeman&#x27;s loyal spy. He does anything Shydeman tells him to do without complaint. He likes to be alone, and he keeps to the shadows most of the time and lacks confidence in what others do, thinking that he must do a job himself to get the work done. Fedela only truly cares about Shydeman and is extremely jealous of anyone that likes him or who is liked by him. He greatly dislikes the amusement that Shydeman got from Gil and tends to mess with Saabel, who also annoys him because of his high rank. Lim Kaana double irritated him for being another of Shydeman&#x27;s favorites and for also being female. Much of Fedelta&#x27;s tactics are &quot;hit and run&quot;, appearing at random to throw the metaphorical wrench into the spokes and severely set back his opponents. He is also Bierrez&#x27;s Older Brother.

;Saabel:Saabel&#x27;s past is deeply connected with the Spirit Tribe. Somewhere along the line, Nadil captured and gave Saabel his powers, and Saabel lost his memory. Afterwards, he became a corpse-gathering demon under Nadil&#x27;s army. He gathers corpses and uses them like puppets to do whatever he pleases. He protects Nadil&#x27;s castle in a sea of souls stolen from those he kills. While Saabel is bored easily, he also has a happy attitude and a quick temper. He is able to create portals, a power that he hides from other Yokai but commonly uses to his own advantage. Saabel is amused by Rath and curious as to why a yokai would help the Dragon Tribe. He uses the gifts he received from Nadil: Garaba (Galaba), Meteaura (Meteora), and the Black Thunder Demon, to kill people to use as his puppets. Saabel has an aversion to the Spirit Tribe, and feels pain whenever a faerie is close due to a curse placed on him by Nadil.

;Gil:Gil was once a human, but was transformed into a demon by Kharl. Later sold to Nadil&#x27;s army, he was treated like a slave by Shydeman and Fedelta. Despite his hopeless situation, he was rescued by a rebel Yokai named Raamganas, who took care of him and treated him fairly and whom Gil eventually fell in love with. But the mind control placed on him by Shyrendora enabled Nadil&#x27;s army to toy with him, turning him into a merciless demonic beast and, in doing so, to kill Raamganas. Gil has little recollection of the things he did, and he lacks the power to stop it. He later killed his brother Barl&#x27;s wife, as well as his niece Fiji. While Gil is one of Lord Nadil&#x27;s prized demons, he is also the rightful Dragon Knight of Fire. Later on Gil takes back his title as a Dragon Knight. (When he finally encounters Raamganas&#x27; spirit, it is revealed that Gil was tricked into thinking he had killed Raamganas when Shydeman and Shyrendora had actually been behind it.)

;Raamganas (Laamgarnas or Laamu Ghanasu):Raamganas was the demon who rescued Gil from Nadil&#x27;s army and nursed him back to health. He risked his life to keep Gil safe and was eventually killed—by Shyrendora&#x27;s mind control on Gil. Laamu Garnas loved Gil deeply, and his memory haunted Gil even after his &quot;death&quot; at Rath&#x27;s hands.

;Bierrez (Viaresu):Bierrez (or Viaresu) is a youkai who is very loosely affiliated with Nadil&#x27;s army. A rebel demon, Bierrez keeps his loyalties to himself and dislikes being told what to do, often masterminding his own schemes rather than following orders. Due to an encounter with the Dragon Lord&#x27;s blood as a young youkai, Bierrez used to be the only youkai able to enter the Dragon castle. While pretending to retrieve Cesia for Nadil&#x27;s army, Bierrez actually attacked the Dragon Castle single-handedly in order to rescue her (though she didn&#x27;t know it and refused to leave). He has a very close attachment to Cesia, having known her for several years, always watching out for her from behind the scenes and protecting her from other youkai who want her powers. While he appears to simply be trying to better his own place in life, Bierrez actually puts a lot of effort into doing what he thinks is best for Cesia; ultimately, he asked Rath to kill him in order to protect her. At the time of his &quot;death&quot; in the fourth volume, Bierrez possessed the Red Dragon Gem and was the Red Dragon Officer candidate. When Rath &quot;killed&quot; him, he absorbed the Red Dragon Gem. When revived by Cesia in volume 21, Bierrez agreed to become the Red Dragon Officer. He now refers to himself as a Dragon rather than as a yokai. Also Fedelta&#x27;s younger brother.

;Lim Kaana (Rim Kaana):Lim Kaana (or Rim Kaana), a young female demon, was created along with her sister Leelu Reel (or Riru Riru) by Shydeman. One of her first major tasks was to steal back the Power of Varawoo from Rune... A task that failed miserably. Currently containing some of Tintlet&#x27;s memories, Lim has been converted from the yokai mission and now works for the Dragon Tribe, trying her best to help them with her mix of demon magic and newfound faerie powers. Lim Kaana is quickly falling in love with Rune, but Rune himself seems to remain oblivious...

;Roobal (Lobal):Roobal (or Lobal) is one of Bierrez&#x27;s friends, who gave up his arm so that Bierrez could use it. This character somehow survived Illuser&#x27;s attack way back at Nadil&#x27;s castle. He used to work for Nadil but he rebelled and now seems to be allied with the Dragons. He finally reveals his face and name at the 22nd volume.

===Lord Kharl and Garfakcy===
;Kharl the Alchemist:A mysterious yokai who manipulates parts of the demon army from behind the scenes. He is able to create demons from captured faeries using his alchemy (An alchemist in this world is one who &quot;creates souls&quot;, not one who tries to create gold.). He can transform other species as well into demons using demon seeds, which infect the body and change it into an alternate demonic form. He uses two &quot;birds&quot;, which are sometimes referred to as his &quot;wings&quot;, to aid him in this process. Left Bird creates minds, while Right Bird creates bodies. Left Bird was killed by Rath, halting Kharl&#x27;s construction of intelligent demons, but has a connection to the small demon named Zoma. Kharl also is the writer of the &quot;Demon Bible&quot;, a &quot;how-to&quot; guide on creating demons out of your own force. He also has several clones floating around, and a Demon Dog named Sinistora which he crafted to look suspiciously like the dead Snow Crewger and Ice Illuser. Very interested in anything unusual, Kharl is fascinated with strange plants, food, demons, and humans. Strangely enough, Kharl has taken in a human boy named Garfakcy and prolonged his life, keeping him as a maid-cook-gardener-spy-assassin-experiment. He is also a slob and tends to forget things and make messes. His role is that of a mad scientist. Kharl also harbors a strong craving for Rath: he wants to steal him back from the Dragon Tribe, but is finding himself strangely unable to do so, and not because he lacks the power needed. It is later revealed that Kharl was a friend/adviser of the Demon King of Arinas.

;Garfakcy:A human boy taken in by Lord Kharl, Garfakcy has repeatedly voiced wishes to be turned into a demon, a desire Kharl simply laughs off. While unable to use magic of his own, Garfakcy casts spells using magical ash Kharl has created. He hates to feel weak or vulnerable, and doesn&#x27;t let this side of himself show, preferring to come off as competent, even ruthless and vindictive. While seeming to be constantly irritated at the older yokai for his (many) annoying habits (forgetting things and making messes among them), Garfakcy is highly loyal to him and hates to see him threatened or hurt... Or to see him channeling his attention towards someone else.

:These two are also very friendly to each other, like they are a real family. Dragon Knights volume 18 has a few bonus side stories based on these two&#x27;s daily life, and it is quite funny. Two of these stories are a &quot;cooking show&quot; with Kharl and Garfakcy in which Kharl fails to make edible food and creates demons instead. In the sequel, he plays the important role.

===Others===
;Zoma
:A demon Cesia took under her wing when she first escaped the witch, he is very protective of her, and she cares for him deeply. He was the only one who stayed with her during her time captive by Nadil&#x27;s army and the witch, and accompanied her to the Dragon Castle, even though he is a demon. He doesn&#x27;t have much confidence in his abilities as he spent most of his short life unable to walk and without any skills other than the odd talent of being able to travel through mirrors. Zoma has ties to both Rath and Nohiro, and holds an inner power far greater than he can imagine or comprehend. It is now known that Zoma is Lord Kharl&#x27;s left bird and he is restored to his true shape when Rath, Rune, and Thatz go to Nadil&#x27;s palace to rescue Cesia.

;Nohiro
:A strange human, Nohiro has healing powers that far surpass that of any known faerie or elf. He has no recollections of his past apart from a vague memory of the Spirit Tribe. This has set off his quest to find out about the disappearance of the faeries and to save them from total destruction (and, of course, to wed a pretty elfin girl). He is also mysteriously connected to Rath and, therefore, to Zoma, although, when asked, Rath denied ever hearing of him. Very kindhearted, Nohiro is just learning how to use his powers and is currently traveling the land and working odd jobs in an attempt to earn money for his voyage. He also seems rather fond of Rune.

;Miyabi, Shian, and Hanakusuku
:Miyabi, Shian, and Hanakusuku are three Water Lights or faeries who teamed up with Nohiro on his search for more of the Spirit Tribe. Tight friends, they spend much of their time arguing with each other and vying for &quot;Lord Nohiro&#x27;s&quot; attention and praise. Of the three, only Miyabi currently survives, the other two falling in Nohiro&#x27;s defense as they fled from Lord Kharl&#x27;s castle.

;Ringleys
:Ringleys, another Water Light, was rescued from a demon by Thatz and Kitchel and accompanied Kitchel on her quest for the Three Treasures. Lacking many powers, Ringleys comes along for moral support... And to be randomly thrust by Kitchel into situations against his will.

;Reema
:Reema is a death fairy. She helps noble souls into the Afterlife. She behaves childishly and playfully at times. But when it suits her she seems to have the mind of an adult and displays omniscient tendencies, doing her best to warn the Dragon clan of impending disasters though apparently these preordained events must happen. She has some feelings for Alfeegi; she helped him and the Dragon King in a demon town, and as he was dying he kissed her.

;Duuma
:Reema&#x27;s companion and/or watcher, he takes their duties very seriously and tries to protect her. He appears to share the same foreknowledge of events.

===Heavenly Black and Evil White &quot;(2014-present)&quot;===

;Natasu 
: The main protagonist of this series. He is a son of former Dragon Lord (Lykouleon) and former Dragon Queen (Raselene) who looks like Lykouleon and considers as a &quot;stray member&quot; in Dragon clan. He is very curious and adventurous; likes to travel around the world. He was one of the mysterious characters that often appeared in the original story along with Rio and Silk.

;Rio/Figeas Illuser 
: A mysterious boy who owns a shop who befriends with Natasu and Silk. He was one of the mysterious characters that often appeared in the original story along with Natasu and Silk. In author&#x27;s earlier draft his name was originally &quot;Ringas&quot;. It reveals, he is a son of the current Dragon Lord (Rath) and Dragon Queen (Cesia). Also, an older fraternal twin brother of Ceren, who is also known as Heaven Star Princess.

; Silk
: A fairy who accompanies with Natasu. Also, she appeared in the original story where she turned into demon due to Kharl meddling and died. Later, she was reborn by Nohiro&#x27;s power.

;Heaven Star Princess/Ceren
:A mysterious girl whose real name is not revealed. She gives Cesia the Wind Staff. She knows things that are about to happen and gives the characters valuable information. Although there isn&#x27;t much information about her, it&#x27;s known that she has a greater role later in the story. In the sequel, her real name is Ceren, a newly bride of King of Arinas, daughter of the current Dragon Lord (Rath), Dragon Queen (Cesia) and Rio&#x27;s younger fraternal twin sister.

;Grinfish
:The Heaven Star Princess&#x27;s bodyguard. Like the princess, he is also a mysterious character with very few appearances. Not much is said about him either. In &quot;Heavenly Black and Evil White&quot;, Grinfish plays the important role in the sequel along with Heaven Star Princess.

==Manga==

&quot;Dragon Knights&quot; was changed to being made in an unflopped format by Tokyopop in May 2002.

&quot;Dragon Knights&quot; ended in May 2007 with 26 tankouban volumes.

Following the sequel series called Heavenly Black and Evil White: Dragon Knights 2 Shukufuku no Kuro to Hametsu no Shiro: Doragon Kishidan II&#x27; (祝福の黒と破滅の白:ドラゴン騎士団 II) was released in 2014 and it is currently ongoing.

==Reception==

According to Diamond Comic Distributors in December 2001, the third volume of &quot;Dragon Knights&quot; was the 243rd top selling comic.

<doc id="1133707" wikidata="Q64732998" url="?curid=1133707" title="Animal disease model">
<text>An animal model (short for animal disease model) is a living, non-human, often genetic-engineered animal used during the research and investigation of human disease, for the purpose of better understanding the disease process without the risk of harming a human. Although biological activity in an animal model does not ensure an effect in humans, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models. Animal models representing specific taxonomic groups in the research and study of developmental processes are also referred to as model organisms. There are three main types of animal models: Homologous, Isomorphic and Predictive.
Homologous animals have the same causes, symptoms and treatment options as would humans who have the same disease.
Isomorphic animals share the same symptoms and treatments, only.
Predictive models are similar to a particular human disease in only a couple of aspects. However, these are useful in isolating and making predictions about mechanisms of a set of disease features.

==Phylogeny and genetic similarity==
Although scientific study of animals predates Charles Darwin by several hundred years, the primary justification for the use of animals in research is based on the evolutionary principle that all organisms share some degree of relatedness and genetic similarity due to common ancestry. The study of taxonomic human relatives, then, can provide a great deal of information about mechanism and disease within the human body that can be useful in medicine.

Various phylogenetic trees for vertebrates have been constructed using comparative proteomics, genetics, genomics as well as the geochemical and fossil record. These estimations tell us that humans and chimpanzees last shared a common ancestor about 6 million years ago (mya). As our closest relatives, chimpanzees have a lot of potential to tell us about mechanisms of disease (and what genes may be responsible for human intelligence). However, chimpanzees are rarely used in research and are protected from highly invasive procedures. The most common animal model is the rodent. Phylogenic trees estimate that humans and rodents last shared a common ancestor ~80-100mya. Despite this distant split, humans and rodents have far more similarities than they do differences. This is due to the relative stability of large portions of the genome; making the use of vertebrate animals particularly productive.

Recently, genomic data has been added to techniques to make close comparisons between species and determine relatedness. Humans share about 99% of our genome with chimpanzees (98.7% with bonobos) and over 90% with the mouse. With so much of the genome conserved across species, it is relatively impressive that the differences between humans and mice can be accounted for in approximately six thousand genes (of ~30,000 total). Scientists have been able to take advantage of these similarities in generating experimental and predictive models of human disease.

==Disease models==
Animal models serving in research may have an existing, inbred or induced disease or injury that is similar to a human condition. These test conditions are often termed as animal models of disease. The use of animal models allows researchers to investigate disease states in ways which would be inaccessible in a human patient, performing procedures on the non-human animal that imply a level of harm that would not be considered ethical to inflict on a human.

As in noted the introduction, animal models can be classified as homologous, isomorphic or predictive. Animal models can also be more broadly classified into four categories:
# experimental,
# spontaneous,
# negative,
# orphan.

Experimental models are most common. These refer to models of disease that resemble human conditions in phenotype or response to treatment but are induced artificially in the laboratory. Some examples include:
* The use of metrazol (pentylenetetrazol) as an animal model of epilepsy
* Immunisation with an auto-antigen to induce an immune response to model autoimmune diseases such as Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
* Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery as an animal model of ischemic stroke
* Injection of blood in the basal ganglia of mice as a model for hemorrhagic stroke
* Sepsis and septic shock induction by impairing the integrity of barrier tissues, administering live pathogens or toxins
* Infecting animals with pathogens to reproduce human infectious diseases
* Injecting animals with agonists or antagonists of various neurotransmitters to reproduce human mental disorders
* Using ionizing radiation to cause tumors
* Using gene transfer to cause tumors
* Implanting animals with tumors to test and develop treatments using ionizing radiation
* Genetically selected (such as in diabetic mice also known as NOD mice)
* Various animal models for of drugs for the treatment of glaucoma
* The use of the ovariectomized rat in osteoporosis research
* Use of Plasmodium yoelii as a model of human malaria 

Spontaneous models refer to diseases that are analogous to human conditions that occur naturally in the animal being studied. These models are rare, but informative.

Negative models essentially refer to control animals, which are useful for validating an experimental result.

Orphan models refer to diseases for which there is no human analog and occur exclusively in the species studied.

The increase in knowledge of the genomes of non-human primates and other mammals that are genetically close to humans is allowing the production of genetically engineered animal tissues, organs and even animal species which express human diseases, providing a more robust model of human diseases in an animal model.

The best models of disease are similar in etiology (mechanism of cause) and phenotype (signs and symptoms) to the human equivalent. However complex human diseases can often be better understood in a simplified system in which individual parts of the disease process are isolated and examined. For instance, behavioral analogues of anxiety or pain in laboratory animals can be used to screen and test new drugs for the treatment of these conditions in humans. A 2000 study found that animal models concorded (coincided on true positives and false negatives) with human toxicity in 71% of cases, with 63% for nonrodents alone and 43% for rodents alone.

In 1987, Davidson et al. suggested that selection of an animal model for research be based on nine considerations. These include

==Behavioral sciences==
Animal models observed in the sciences of psychology and sociology are often termed animal models of behavior. It is difficult to build an animal model that perfectly reproduces the symptoms of depression in patients. Animals lack self-consciousness, self-reflection and consideration; moreover, hallmarks of the disorder such as depressed mood, low self-esteem or suicidality are hardly accessible in non-humans. However, depression, as other mental disorders, consists of endophenotypes that can be reproduced independently and evaluated in animals. An ideal animal model offers an opportunity to understand molecular, genetic and epigenetic factors that may lead to depression. By using animal models, the underlying molecular alterations and the causal relationship between genetic or environmental alterations and depression can be examined, which would afford a better insight into pathology of depression. In addition, animal models of depression are indispensable for identifying novel therapies for depression.

==Challenges and criticisms==
Many animal models serving as test subjects in biomedical research, such as rats and mice, may be selectively sedentary, obese and glucose intolerant. This may confound their use to model human metabolic processes and diseases as these can be affected by dietary energy intake and exercise.

Animal models of psychiatric illness give rise to other concerns. Qualitative assessments of behavior are too often subjective. This would lead the investigator to observe what they want to observe in subjects, and to render conclusions in line with their expectations. Also, the imprecise diagnostic criteria for psychiatric illnesses inevitably lead to problems modeling the condition; e.g., since a person with major depressive disorder may experience weight loss or weight gain, insomnia or hypersomnia, we cannot with any certainty say that a rat with insomnia and weight loss is depressed. Furthermore, the complex nature of psychiatric conditions makes it difficult/impossible to translate human behaviors and deficits; e.g., language deficit plays a major role in autistic spectrum disorders, but – since rodents do not have language – it is not possible to develop a language-impaired &quot;autistic&quot; mouse.

==Ethics==
Debate about the ethical use of animals in research dates at least as far back as 1822 when the British Parliament enacted the first law for animal protection preventing cruelty to cattle, the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822. This was followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849, which criminalized ill-treating, over-driving, and torturing animals. In 1876, under pressure from the National Anti-Vivisection Society, the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849 was amended by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 to include regulations governing the use of animals in research. This new act stipulated that 1) experiments must be proven absolutely necessary for instruction, or to save or prolong human life; 2) animals must be properly anesthetized; and 3) animals must be killed as soon as the experiment is over. Today, these three principles are central to the laws and guidelines governing the use of animals and research. In the U.S., the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 (see also Laboratory Animal Welfare Act) set standards for animal use and care in research. This law is enforced by APHIS&#x27;s Animal Care program see AWA policies.

In academic settings in which NIH funding is used for animal research, institutions are governed by the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). At each site, OLAW guidelines and standards are upheld by a local review board called the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All laboratory experiments involving living animals are reviewed and approved by this committee. In addition to proving the potential for benefit to human health, minimization of pain and distress, and timely and humane euthanasia, experimenters must justify their protocols based on the principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement.

Replacement refers to efforts to engage alternatives to animal use. This includes the use of computer models, non-living tissues and cells, and replacement of &quot;higher-order&quot; animals (primates and mammals) with &quot;lower&quot; order animals (e.g. cold-blooded animals, invertebrates, bacteria) wherever possible (list of common model organisms approved for use by the NIH).

Reduction refers to efforts to minimize number of animals used during the course of an experiment, as well as prevention of unnecessary replication of previous experiments. To satisfy this requirement, mathematical calculations of statistical power are employed to determine the minimum number of animals that can be used to get a statistically significant experimental result. Reduction involves methods to maximize information provided while minimizing the number of animals applied.

Refinement refers to efforts to make experimental design as painless and efficient as possible in order to minimize the suffering of each animal subject.

While significant advances have been made in the care and treatment of animals, this is an ever-evolving debate. Animal rights and protection groups such as the ASPCA, PETA and BUAV continue to advocate for the best laboratory conditions, and experimental protocols possible for animals in research. Pressure from these groups has also led to novel modes of experimentation, which does not involve the sacrifice of live animals.

One aspect of this debate; however, continues to be difficult to resolve: the classification of animals according to a hierarchy, which protects some species more than others. Next to humans, primates are the most protected species in experimentation. The rationale for this has both evolutionary and philosophical underpinnings. Because chimpanzees and other non-human primates can demonstrate intelligence, and social structure that they have a life experiences that is more cognitively complex than lower species. Conversely, this kind of moralizing of complexity of interaction and thought could be considered &quot;specieisism.&quot; Ultimately, this is an argument not likely to be resolved, however most people are more comfortable with the idea of experimentation that involves worms or flies than mice, dogs, or monkeys.

==Alternatives==
Ethical concerns, as well as the cost, maintenance and relative inefficiency of animal research has encouraged development of alternative methods for the study of disease. Cell culture and &quot;in vitro&quot; studies provide an alternative that preserves the physiology of the living cell, but does not require the sacrifice of an animal for mechanistic studies. Human induced pluripotent stem cells can also elucidate new mechanisms for understanding cancer and cell regeneration. Imaging studies (such as MRI or PET scans) enable non-invasive study of human subjects. Recent advances in genetics and genomics can identify disease-associated genes, which can be targeted for therapies.

<text>Radisson is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1957, and has formally existed since the 1958 provincial election. The riding is located in the northeastern section of the City of Winnipeg and is named after Pierre-Esprit Radisson, a seventeenth-century explorer.

Radisson is bordered on the east by Transcona and Springfield, to the south by Southdale, to the north by River East, and to the west by Rossmere, Concordia and St. Boniface. The Canadian National Railway Symington Yards are in the southern part of the riding.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,113. In 1999, the average family income was $54084, and the unemployment rate was 4.60%. Radisson&#x27;s francophone population is 9%, and there are also significant Ukrainian (7%) and German (6%) communities.

Manufacturing accounts for 14% of Radisson&#x27;s industry, with a further 13% in the retail trade.

New Democratic Party MLA and former party leader Russell Paulley represented the riding for many years, although the boundaries changed dramatically with the 1998 redistribution. The Progressive Conservatives won the riding in 1977, and the Liberals did the same in 1988. In both cases, the NDP regained the seat after a single term.

==Members of the Legislative Assembly==
This riding has elected the following MLAs:

<text>Throughout the War in Afghanistan, there had been 3,621 coalition deaths in Afghanistan as part of the coalition operations (Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF) since the invasion in 2001. In this total, the American figure is for deaths &quot;In and Around Afghanistan&quot; which, as defined by the United States Department of Defense, includes some deaths in Pakistan and Uzbekistan and the deaths of 18 CIA operatives.

In addition to these deaths in Afghanistan, another 59 U.S. and one Canadian soldier were killed in other countries while supporting operations in Afghanistan. The total also omits the 62 Spanish soldiers returning from Afghanistan who died in Turkey on 26 May 2003, when their plane crashed.

During the first five years of the war, the vast majority of coalition deaths were American, but between 2006 and 2011, a significant proportion were amongst other nations, particularly the United Kingdom and Canada which have been assigned responsibility for the flashpoint provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, respectively. This is because in 2006, ISAF expanded its jurisdiction to the southern regions of Afghanistan which were previously under the direct authority of the U.S. military. As Robert Gates pointed out on 10 June 2011, in his &quot;last policy speech&quot; as U.S. Secretary of Defense, &quot;more than 850 troops from non-U.S. NATO members have made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan. For many allied nations these were the first military casualties they have taken since the end of the Second World War.&quot; Additionally, there have been 95 fatalities among troops from the non-NATO contributors to the coalition (Georgia, Australia, Sweden, New Zealand, Finland, Jordan, South Korea and Albania).

With 711 Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF deaths, 2010 was the deadliest year for foreign military troops since the U.S. invasion in 2001, continuing the trend that occurred every year since 2003.

In 2009, there were 7,228 improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in Afghanistan, a 120% increase over 2008, and a record for the war. Of the 512 foreign soldiers killed in 2009, 448 were killed in action. 280 of those were killed by IEDs. In 2010, IED attacks in Afghanistan wounded 3,366 U.S. soldiers, which is nearly 60% of the total IED-wounded since the start of the war. Of the 711 foreign soldiers killed in 2010, 630 were killed in action. 368 of those were killed by IEDs, which is around 36% of the total IED-killed since the start of the war to date. Insurgents planted 14,661 IEDs in 2010, a 62% increase over the previous year.

<text>Katrina and the Waves is the third studio album by American/English new wave band Katrina and the Waves, released in March 1985 by Capitol Records. It was their first album on a major label, and a Top 30 hit in the US and the UK. The majority of tracks were re-mixed and overdubbed versions of songs that had appeared on their first two albums; the tracks &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot; were entirely re-recorded versions of songs from their first independently released album.

This version of &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; became a top-ten pop hit in both the US and the UK.

==Background==
Between 1983 and 1984, English-based Katrina and the Waves released their first two albums on the Canadian Attic label and enjoyed some airplay success in Canada as well as a chart position on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Que Te Quiero&quot; (#84). Helped by intensive touring and the added mystique of their releases being on import in England and the United States, the band&#x27;s reputation was growing. And when the Bangles covered &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot;, a song from Katrina and the Waves&#x27; first album, major record labels started to take an interest. This eventually led to signing a deal with Capitol Records in Los Angeles.

It was decided to re-record, overdub or remix ten tracks from the two Canadian albums for their Capitol debut. The label wanted to make some of the songs more single-worthy, particularly &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot; and &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;, so the band did some recording and mixing in London with producer Pat Collier, who had worked on their first two albums. &quot;We did loads of versions [of &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;],&quot; Collier said in 2017. &quot;We just kept going round and round in circles. We kept redoing it nonstop.&quot; They also added a horn section, which the original 1983 version didn&#x27;t have. Katrina Leskanich said in 2015, &quot;As we were recording it, an arranger wandered in and said: &quot;You should put horns on that.&quot; And he hummed what became that pumping melody. But the horn section we got in whinged so much about how hard it was to play that we had to drop the key just for them.&quot;

Ultimately, Capitol decided to outsource a remix, and the tracks were given to engineer Scott Litt at the Power Station in New York. The band arrived from London with Collier to meet with their new label and to be in New York while Litt mixed the album. Due to a problem with the drum tracks for &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;, Litt had to re-record the drums at the Power Station. When drummer Alex Cooper had finished his work in a couple of takes, &quot;it was phenomenal,&quot; Litt said in 2017. &quot;All of a sudden the song exploded. As soon as the drums were done, that spurred us on to do more. I was flying guitars around.&quot; Talking with &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine in 2021 about working with Litt on &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;, Leskanich said, &quot;Boy did he wave a magic wand over it, because it was his idea to start with the drums and said that the DJs will go crazy with that sound and it will wake up America. That was a stroke of genius. He was a great producer, getting the sound right.&quot; Litt also re-arranged parts in the song, like holding the horns out of the first chorus, and Leskanich&#x27;s &quot;Woo,&quot; which was somewhere else in the song, was put in after the drum intro. &quot;Scott absolutely made that track,&quot; Collier said. &quot;He took it in hand and made it what it is.&quot;

According to Leskanich, &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; was never meant to be the album&#x27;s first single, as Capitol originally wanted to go with &quot;Do You Want Crying&quot;. &quot;Capitol sent out a sampler of four tracks and all the DJs said, &quot;It&#x27;s the &quot;Sunshine&quot; song because we can talk over the intro and it&#x27;s got the right energy for summer,&quot; she said. When the song was released as a single in March 1985, it charted all over Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. By July 1985, &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot; had sold more than 300,000 copies worldwide.

==Critical reception==
In two contemporary reviews for &quot;Village Voice&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;, critic Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;For a while I thought the only thing Capitol had done right was sign them, but between the exuberant Katrina Leskanich and the surefire Kimberley Rew this band would be hard for any label to fuck up: not one of the twenty songs on the band&#x27;s two Attic LPs ... is a loser.&quot; Christgau felt that, as a songwriter, Rew has an &quot;unerring knack for up-to-the-minute Sixties-style hooks&quot; and writes &quot;rock-outsider lyrics that never get obtrusively specific,&quot; while Leskanich has &quot;a voice so big and enthusiastic she could make Barry Manilow&#x27;s songs sound like Holland-Dozier-Holland.&quot; The &quot;tricky&quot; new version of &quot;Machine Gun Smith&quot; makes up for the &quot;Motown horns&quot; added to &quot;Walking on Sunshine,&quot; Christgau said, and the re-recorded &quot;hyped-up&quot; drums on the latter &quot;don&#x27;t really hurt anything.&quot;

Commenting on the songs being re-recorded or remixed, &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote, &quot;In most cases, it&#x27;s an improvement, exposing untapped realms of both pop and power, but the second &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot; obliterates the atmosphere and the hooky melody of the original in an absurdly overheated arrangement. With that one caveat, &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot; is otherwise a delight.&quot;

In a review for AllMusic, David Cleary wrote that re-recording ten songs from their first two albums made a lot of sense, given the &quot;criminal&quot; lack of attention the albums received. Recorded in what Cleary described as &quot;an aggressive power pop style&quot;, most of the songs &quot;hold up extremely well under this approach,&quot; he said. He singled out &quot;Red Wine and Whisky&quot; and &quot;Do You Want Crying&quot;, describing them as &quot;desperately driven and urgent tuneful rockers,&quot; while &quot;Cry for Me&quot; and &quot;The Sun Won&#x27;t Shine&quot; &quot;regenerate as blues-like shouting numbers of apocalyptic intensity.&quot; Cleary called the album &quot;an essential purchase.&quot;

<text>Malmsbury railway station is a regional railway station on the Deniliquin line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the north-western suburb and town of Malmsbury, in Victoria, Australia. Malmsbury station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring a single platform and a disused platform. It opened on 21 October 1862.

Disused stations at Taradale and Elphinstone are located between Malmsbury and Castlemaine. Chewton station, which has been demolished, was also located between Malmsbury and Castlemaine, while the former Redesdale Junction was located between Malmsbury and Kyneton.

== History ==
In 1968, a carriage dock and a number of sidings were removed. Further sidings were removed in 1978.

A large bluestone station building remains on the disused northern platform, and a collection of shelter sheds on the southern platform. As part of the Regional Fast Rail project in 2006, the double-track line from Kyneton to Bendigo was converted to single track, with the track on the former Melbourne-bound platform removed.

On 31 January 2024, the station building on the disused northern platform was damaged by fire. The fire brigade managed to confine the blaze to the former station office and signal bay. Police charged two teenagers from Bendigo with arson.

== Platforms and services ==
Malmsbury has one platform. It is served by V/Line Bendigo and Echuca line trains in both directions, and one weekday and one weekend Swan Hill line service.

Platform 1:
* services to Bendigo, Epsom, Eaglehawk and Southern Cross
* services to Echuca and Southern Cross
* one weekday and one weekend service to Swan Hill

<doc id="1133724" wikidata="Q1671694" url="?curid=1133724" title="The Invaders">
<text>The Invaders is an American science-fiction television series created by Larry Cohen that aired on ABC for two seasons, from 1967 to 1968. Roy Thinnes stars as David Vincent, who after stumbling across evidence of an in-progress invasion of aliens from outer space—the aliens disguising themselves as humans and gradually infiltrating human institutions—tries to thwart the invasion despite the disbelief of officials and the general public, and the undermining of his efforts by the aliens. The series was a Quinn Martin production.

==Plot==
The architect David Vincent accidentally learns of a secret alien invasion already underway and thereafter travels from place to place attempting to foil the aliens&#x27; plots and warn a skeptical populace of the danger. Other plot elements include Vincent&#x27;s grim and lonely determination to find &quot;tangible proof of the invaders’ existence&quot; despite having become a &quot;quasi-famous object of public ridicule&quot;; the aliens&#x27; success in hiding their plots, undermining Vincent&#x27;s credibility and killing off those who also discover them in ways disguised as a natural death; and the constant tension over whether the individuals Vincent comes across are humans or aliens. As the series progresses, Vincent is able to convince a small number of people to help him fight the aliens.

In many episodes, at least one individual, often a key figure such as a U.S. Air Force intelligence officer (in the episode &quot;The Innocent&quot;), a police officer (in &quot;Genesis&quot; and &quot;The Spores&quot;), a U.S. Army major (&quot;Doomsday Minus One&quot;), or a NASA official (&quot;Moonshot&quot;) becomes aware of the alien threat and survives the episode in which he or she was introduced. In &quot;The Leeches&quot;, a millionaire (Arthur Hill) survives an alien abduction after being rescued by Vincent, while in &quot;Quantity: Unknown&quot; a scientist (Susan Strasberg) is convinced of alien technology. In &quot;The Saucer&quot;, guest stars Anne Francis and Charles Drake witness an alien saucer&#x27;s landing. In the second season, larger groups of surviving witnesses were featured, as in episodes &quot;Dark Outpost&quot; and &quot;The Pursued&quot;, and three scientists in &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. Most significant of these is millionaire industrialist Edgar Scoville (Kent Smith), who became a semi-regular character as of December 1967, heading a small but influential group from the episode &quot;The Believers&quot;. Later episodes had the military involved (&quot;The Peacemaker&quot;), as Vincent&#x27;s claims were now clearly being taken more seriously. In &quot;The Miracle&quot; (guest star Barbara Hershey), after an alien encounter, Vincent manages to retain a piece of alien technology both as evidence and for examination by both his group and the authorities.

The series depicted an undercurrent of at least partial credulity among authority figures regarding Vincent&#x27;s claims, even in the first season, as in early episodes such as &quot;The Mutation&quot;, where a security agent (Lin McCarthy) is keeping an eye on Vincent and ends up inclined to believe him. In &quot;The Innocent&quot;, the USAF officer (Dabney Coleman) guns down an alien who incinerates in front of him, tying in with Vincent&#x27;s claims; while at the end of the episode after apparently disbelieving Vincent, he then phones USAF security to run a full background check on an officer whom Vincent claimed was an alien. In &quot;Moonshot&quot;, the NASA official (Peter Graves) is fully expecting Vincent to arrive; and in &quot;Condition: Red&quot;, a NORAD officer and staff witness an alien UFO formation onscreen, and are left convinced. Each of these incidents is kept to just the individual episode, with hinted official backing of Vincent (or at least &#x27;semi-backing&#x27; suggested in the episode &quot;The Condemned&quot;). Elsewhere, Vincent is shown as being publicly &#x27;dismissed as a crank&#x27; by the authorities, while behind the scenes they apparently take him seriously—for example in &quot;Doomsday Minus One&quot;, where Vincent has been invited by an Army intelligence official and then is given classified information; in the two-part &quot;Summit Meeting&quot; where he is present at a top security meeting without any question; and in &quot;Condition: Red&quot; where he is allowed into NORAD without question. Thus, viewers were left to draw their own conclusions as to the situation regarding Vincent&#x27;s actual standing.

===Characteristics of the invaders===

The emphasis of the series is on Vincent and his efforts, and unlike most science fiction the back story of the aliens—their &quot;dying&quot; planet in &quot;another galaxy&quot; (or even their names)—is &quot;a deliberate blank&quot;. They appear human except for a few telltale characteristics (they lack a pulse, the ability to bleed, or show emotion, and many have a deformed fourth finger). While the disguised aliens can be killed by humans, they glow red and disintegrate when this happens, eliminating evidence of their existence. The aliens are shown in their true form in only two episodes. In &quot;Genesis&quot; (season one, episode five), an ill alien researcher loses his human form and is briefly seen immersed in a tank of water. &quot;The Enemy&quot; has a dying, mutated Invader (Richard Anderson) revert to his true appearance. Unless they receive periodic treatments in what Vincent calls &quot;regeneration chambers&quot;, which consume a great deal of electrical power, they revert to their alien form. One scene in the series showed an alien beginning to revert, filmed in soft focus and with pulsating red light.

Most of the aliens, in particular the lowest-ranking members or workers in green jumpsuits, are emotionless and have deformed little fingers that cannot move and are bent at an unnatural angle, although &quot;deluxe models&quot; could manipulate this finger. Black aliens&#x27; palms were not pale, like humans of African descent, but were the same shade as the rest of their skins. Some mutants experience emotions similar to those of humans and even oppose the alien takeover.

When aliens die, their bodies glow red and burn up along with their clothes and anything else they were touching, preventing the documenting of their existence. On several occasions, a dying alien would deliberately touch a piece of their technology to prevent it from falling into the hands of humans. In episode three (&quot;The Mutation&quot;), a female alien who falls for Vincent and is killed while running to warn him he is in danger tells him, &quot;That&#x27;s what happens to us when we die here on Earth.&quot;

===Technology of the invaders===
The type of spaceship by which the Invaders reach the Earth is a flying saucer of a design resembling early 1950s photographs of alleged UFOs produced by self-proclaimed UFO &quot;contactee&quot; George Adamski. They differ slightly from Adamski&#x27;s images in not having three spheres on the underside, but instead five shallower protrusions. Numerous pieces of alien technology featured &quot;penta&quot; or five-sided designs. It was a principle of the production crew to show The Invaders&#x27; technology with set, prop designs, and control panels that were utterly alien from the conventional human ones (such as H. R. Giger would later present in &quot;Alien&quot;).

To kill humans they apply a small, handheld, disc-shaped weapon with five glowing white lights to the back of the victim&#x27;s head or neck to induce a seemingly natural death, which is usually diagnosed as a cerebral hemorrhage. They also employ weapons that disintegrate witnesses, vehicles, and when necessary members of their own race with some sort of ray. Also in their arsenal is a small device consisting of two spinning, transparent crystals joined at their corners which acts like a truth serum, forces human beings to do the aliens&#x27; bidding, or (in most cases) imposes the complete loss of memory of previous events.

==Themes==
According to producer Alan A. Armer, &quot;The major thing that the show had going for it is the fact that we are all a little bit paranoid, and that it’s easy to identify with ... one person fighting the society, fighting the government, fighting an invisible force ...” Series creator Larry Cohen noted the similarities between &quot;The Invaders&quot; and another Quinn Martin-produced show, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, while also describing Alfred Hitchcock as a major influence.

Of course &quot;The Invaders&quot; was definitely in the same genre as &quot;The Fugitive&quot;: a man moving across America, in search of something, and in jeopardy. Really, to me, my idea was taken more from Alfred Hitchcock than it was taken from &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. I always liked the Hitchcock movie where the hero is in a situation where he&#x27;s the only one that knows the spies are operating, and no one will believe him. And when he takes the police back to the locale where he saw their operation, everything has been removed, there&#x27;s no more evidence, everybody lies and says that he was never there before.

Such Hitchcock movies include &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) with Robert Donat, &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942) with Robert Cummings, and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959) with Cary Grant.

The large numbers of UFO reports in the post-World War II era was the subject of paranoia and conspiracy, as scientists and authorities (the Condon Committee and the Robertson Panel), and debunkers dismissed or downplayed the reports; and dedicated &quot;ufologists&quot; made sometimes-outlandish claims of alien presence on Earth and of earthly conspiracies to suppress evidence of it. Interest in the subject of UFOs became fringe, and &quot;a punchline&quot; in popular culture.

==Cast==
* Roy Thinnes appears as David Vincent in all 43 episodes. For the first 30 episodes, he is the only recurring character.
* Kent Smith appears as Edgar Scoville for 13 episodes, beginning with episode 31, &quot;The Believers&quot;. Scoville heads a small group called The Believers, who accept David Vincent&#x27;s claims of alien invasion. None of the other Believers are series regulars, and are typically only seen briefly on-screen as extras or in bit roles. 
* Lin McCarthy appears as Col. Archie Harmon, a skeptical friend of Scoville&#x27;s, in two episodes.
* Alfred Ryder appears as an Invaders leader in three episodes. 
* Max Kleven appears as an unnamed Alien in five episodes.

==Production==
===Development===
The series was produced by Quinn Martin, who was looking for a show to replace the immensely popular &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, which was ending its run in 1967. Larry Cohen, the series&#x27; creator, had conceived two earlier series with similarities to &quot;The Invaders.&quot; Chuck Connors starred in &quot;Branded&quot; (1965) as a soldier court-martialed for cowardice, who traveled the West searching for witnesses and proof that he had acted valiantly, and &quot;Coronet Blue&quot; (1967) about Michael Alden, a man suffering from amnesia who was being pursued by a powerful group of people. All he could remember were the words &quot;Coronet Blue&quot;.

Another inspiration was the wave of &quot;alien &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;&quot; films which had come 10 years before in the 1950s, typified by &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956) and the British film &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; (1957), known in America as &quot;Enemy from Space&quot;. While these paranoid tales of extraterrestrials who lived among us, posing as humans while planning a takeover, are usually linked with a Red Scare subtext, Martin simply wanted a premise that would keep the hero moving around and that would explain why he could not go to the authorities (i.e. not only had some aliens infiltrated human institutions already, but most humans would dismiss a claim of alien invasion as a paranoid delusion). However, as the series unfolded, the various &#x27;disappearances&#x27; of people in episodes (killed by the Invaders, such as Vincent&#x27;s partner Alan Landers—played by James Daly—in the pilot, etc.), those installed alien figures revealed to be aliens by Vincent thus having to withdraw (such as Edward Andrews&#x27; character in &quot;The Mutation&quot;, etc.) plus the surviving one or two key human witnesses in most episodes (from the third episode onwards) did rather alter the basic premise of the show to something deeper and more thought-provoking early on.

Season one was produced in association with the ABC Television Network or as it was listed in the end credits, &quot;The American Broadcasting Company Television Networks&quot;.

===Production Sequence===
Before each episode, an &quot;in color&quot; promo bumper, typical of most ABC programs of the era, appears, as ABC was the last network to adopt color programming: &quot;Next... The Invaders, In Color!&quot;

Then, following the bumper, each episode begins with a cold open, to help set up the plot of the episode to come. After the prologue, the main title appears, announced by Dick Wesson:

The Invaders! A Quinn Martin Production. Starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent.

(A different shot of Thinnes&#x27; face was used for the second season.) This would be followed by the opening narration (by Bill Woodson):

The Invaders, alien beings from a dying planet. Their destination: the Earth. Their purpose: to make it &quot;their&quot; world. David Vincent has seen them. For him, it began one lost night on a lonely country road, looking for a shortcut that he never found. It began with a closed deserted diner, and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey. It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy. Now David Vincent knows that the Invaders are here, that they have taken human form. Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun.

Then, in a manner typical of Quinn Martin productions, Wesson would announce, &quot;The guest stars in tonight&#x27;s story...&quot;, and announce the name of each guest star (typically three or four) over a series of close-up clips of the guest stars. Wesson would then announce &quot;Tonight&#x27;s Episode&quot;, and say the title of the episode about to be viewed, which would also appear on screen.

Also typical of Quinn Martin productions of the time, the show was divided into &quot;Acts&quot; labeled by the Roman numerals I-IV, preceded by a cold open. A narration preceded Act I, and Act IV came before an Epilog with narration at the end.

Dominic Frontiere, who had provided scores for &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, provided scores for &quot;The Invaders&quot; as well.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1967)===
===Season 2 (1967–68)===
==Home media==
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released the entire series on DVD in Regions 1, 2 &amp; PAL 4.

On June 5, 2018, CBS Home Entertainment released &quot;The Invaders: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

Thinnes also provided audio commentary for the official &quot;The Invaders&quot; DVD releases. He has also filmed special video introductions for every 
episode, which are an optional &quot;Play&quot; feature on the episode menus. The &quot;in color&quot; bumper follows each of these introductions. Since the 1960s, recurring public interest in UFO lore may have helped to revive interest in the television series, and commentary on the DVD collections acknowledges that, in private life, Thinnes has kept up a strong interest in UFO-related information.

On May 5, 2019, &quot;classic-TV&quot; digital/basic-cable network MeTV began weekly airings of &quot;The Invaders&quot; as part of its &quot;Red-Eye Sci-Fi Saturday Night&quot; late Saturday evening/early Sunday morning programming lineup.

==Spin-offs and remakes==
===&quot;Quinn Martin&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (1977)===
The pilot episode of the series, &quot;Beachhead&quot;, was remade in 1977 for another Quinn Martin series, &quot;Quinn Martin&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (known in the United Kingdom as &quot;Twist in the Tale&quot;), where it was retitled &quot;The Nomads&quot;.

===The Invaders miniseries (1995)===
In 1995, the premise was used as the basis for a four-hour television miniseries remake titled &quot;The Invaders&quot; on Fox. Scott Bakula starred as Nolan Wood, who discovers the alien conspiracy, and Roy Thinnes very briefly appeared as David Vincent, now an old man handing the burden over to Wood. The miniseries has been released in some countries on home video, edited into a single movie. The first part aired on November 12, 1995; part 2 aired on November 14, 1995 (both in two-hour time slots).

==Reuse of footage==
Several seconds of footage from the opening sequence of the flying saucer approaching Earth from space appears in the opening of the episode &quot;The Innocent Prey&quot; of the series &quot;The Fantastic Journey&quot;. It aired on June 6, 1977. In the plot of that final episode of the series, the saucer was a prisoner transport ship of the future operated by humans that malfunctioned and crashed on Earth at night in the heavy vegetation of a jungle. The full-scale saucer used in ground scenes, however, was physically different on the outside and inside from &quot;The Invaders&quot; one.

==&quot;The Invaders&quot; abroad ==
Both seasons of the series were broadcast in Romania around 1970.. Several episodes aired in Hungary in 1980, running from July 4 to September 5 under the title &quot;Támadás egy idegen bolygóról&quot; (&quot;Attack from an Alien Planet&quot;). Newspaper reviews tended to be critical of the show being &quot;more fiction than science&quot;, but it was nevertheless well received by viewers, as attested by references to it in popular culture at the time.

== In other media ==

<text>Castlemaine railway station is a regional railway station on the Deniliquin line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the north-western suburb and town of Castlemaine, in Victoria, Australia. Castlemaine station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 21 October 1862.

The station is also the termini of the Maldon and Moolort lines, but no passenger revenue services currently operates on the latter line, with the Victorian Goldfields Railway operating heritage services on the Maldon line.

Disused stations Elphinstone and Taradale are located between Castlemaine and Malmsbury, while disused stations Harcourt and Ravenswood are located between Castlemaine and Kangaroo Flat. Demolished station Chewton was also located between Castlemaine and Malmsbury.

== History ==
In 1973, a turntable at the station was abolished. On 9 July 1977, the passenger service to Maryborough was withdrawn, and in 1978, a number of points were abolished, as was a crossover and the former carriage dock.

Rationalisation of the former yard occurred during the late 1980s. In 1989, signal boxes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; were abolished, and replaced with a signal panel within the station office. Mechanical points were also abolished, and all signals were replaced with two and three position signals. Also in that year, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Parker Street level crossing, located nearby in the down direction of the station.

On 17 December 2004, the Victorian Goldfields Railway was extended from Muckleford to Castlemaine. On 17 January 2005, the signal panel was abolished.

== Platforms and services ==

Castlemaine has one island platform with two faces (Platforms 2 and 3) and one side platform (Platform 1). Platforms 1 and 2 are used by V/Line Bendigo, Echuca and Swan Hill line services in both directions, while Platform 3 is used by Victorian Goldfields Railway heritage services to Maldon.

<text>Kangaroo Flat railway station is a regional railway station on the Deniliquin line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the southern suburb of Kangaroo Flat, in Bendigo, Victoria, Australia. Kangaroo Flat station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 February 1874.

Initially opened as Kangaroo Flat, the station was renamed to Kangaroo on 9 May 1904. Then was given its current name of Kangaroo Flat on 17 July 1916, back to its original station name.

==History==

The contract for the construction of Kangaroo Flat was let in 1862. In 1904, it was renamed Kangaroo, resuming its original identity in 1916. By 1926, facilities included a signal frame, a pair of side platforms on the double track line, a goods siding and shed on the eastern side of the line, and a crossover between tracks. In 1938, the stationmaster was withdrawn, with the station being worked by the porter-in-charge, under &quot;caretaker&quot; conditions.

From 1889, the station was a block point, under the Winters Block system, but it could be &quot;switched out&quot; in times of quieter traffic. That status remained until 1980, when the signal box was only &quot;switched in&quot; when required. In 1987, the signal box was closed, and all points and signals removed.

After a fire in 1990 that caused extensive damage, the station building was left unused, and only two trains per weekday stopped at the station. In 2002, the exterior of the station building and the former goods shed were restored. The Regional Fast Rail project in 2005 saw the line towards Melbourne singled south of the station.

Following a community-led campaign for better services in Bendigo&#x27;s southern growth corridor, an upgrade of the station was announced in February 2008, involving the construction of a new booking office, a 50-bay car park and bus interchange, and the refurbishment of the waiting room. In January 2014, the platforms were extended, to accommodate longer trains.

Disused stations Ravenswood and Harcourt are located between Kangaroo Flat and Castlemaine, whilst disused station Golden Square is located between Kangaroo Flat and Bendigo.

===Accidents and incidents===
On 15 February 2017, V/Line VLocity set VL34 derailed after colliding with a vehicle that had been abandoned on the line near Kangaroo Flat. Two people were taken to hospital.

==Platforms and services==

Kangaroo Flat has two side platforms. Platform 1 is used by almost all V/Line Bendigo, Echuca and Swan Hill line services travelling in both directions. Platform 2 is used by one Bendigo line service towards Eaglehawk every weekday.

Platform 1:
* services to Bendigo, Epsom, Eaglehawk and Southern Cross
* services to Echuca and Southern Cross
* services to Swan Hill and Southern Cross

Platform 2:
* one weekday service to Eaglehawk

<text>Transcona is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The riding was created by redistribution in 1968, and has formally existed since the 1969 provincial election. It was created out of Radisson and a small slice of Springfield.

The riding is named after and contains Transcona, a neighbourhood in the easternmost tip of the city of Winnipeg. It is bordered to the southwest by Southdale, the west by St. Boniface and Radisson, and in all other directions by the rural riding of Springfield-Ritchot.

The population in 1996 was 19,648. The average family income in 1999 was $50,089, with an unemployment rate of 6.70%. About seven percent of the riding&#x27;s population are Ukrainian Canadians.

The riding is primarily working-class, and includes the Canadian National Railway rail yards. Fifteen percent of the riding&#x27;s industry is in the manufacturing sector, with a further 14% in retail trade.

The former New Democratic Party (NDP) party leader Russell Paulley represented the riding for the first eight years of its legal existence. Candidates from the NDP have won Transcona in all but two of the provincial elections (1988 and 2016, both of which coincided with large provincewide declines in NDP support) in which it has participated since 1969.

<doc id="1133737" wikidata="Q424469" url="?curid=1133737" title="Polyhydroxybutyrate">
<text>Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a polymer belonging to the polyesters class that are of interest as bio-derived and biodegradable plastics. The poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) form of PHB is probably the most common type of polyhydroxyalkanoate, but other polymers of this class are produced by a variety of organisms: these include poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV), polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHH), polyhydroxyoctanoate (PHO) and their copolymers.

==Biosynthesis==
PHB is produced by microorganisms (such as &quot;Cupriavidus necator&quot;, &quot;Methylobacterium rhodesianum&quot; or &quot;Bacillus megaterium&quot;) apparently in response to conditions of physiological stress; mainly conditions in which nutrients are limited. The polymer is primarily a product of carbon assimilation (from glucose or starch) and is employed by microorganisms as a form of energy storage molecule to be metabolized when other common energy sources are not available. 

Microbial biosynthesis of PHB starts with the condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA to give acetoacetyl-CoA which is subsequently reduced to hydroxybutyryl-CoA. This latter compound is then used as a monomer to polymerize PHB. PHAs granules are then recovered by disrupting the cells.


==Thermoplastic polymer==
Most commercial plastics are synthetic polymers derived from petrochemicals. They tend to resist biodegradation. PHB-derived plastics are attractive because they are compostable and derived from renewables and are bio-degradable.

ICI had developed the material to pilot plant stage in the 1980s, but interest faded when it became clear that the cost of material was too high, and its properties could not match those of polypropylene. Some bottles were made for Wella&#x27;s &quot;Sanara&quot; range of shampoo; an example using the tradename &quot;Biopol&quot; is in the collection of the Science Museum, London.

In 1996, Monsanto (who sold PHB as a copolymer with PHV) bought all patents for making the polymer from ICI/Zeneca including the trademark &quot;Biopol&quot;. However, Monsanto&#x27;s rights to Biopol were sold to the American company Metabolix in 2001 and Monsanto&#x27;s fermenters producing PHB from bacteria were closed down at the start of 2004. Monsanto began to focus on producing PHB from plants instead of bacteria. But now with so much media attention on GM crops, there has been little news of Monsanto&#x27;s plans for PHB.

Biopol is currently used in the medical industry for internal suture. It is nontoxic and biodegradable, so it does not have to be removed after recovery.

TephaFLEX is a bacterially derived poly-4-hydroxybutyrate, manufactured using a recombinant fermentation process by Tepha Medical Devices, intended for a variety of medical applications that require biodegradable materials such as absorbable sutures.

==Properties==
*Water-insoluble and relatively resistant to hydrolytic degradation. This differentiates PHB from most other currently available biodegradable plastics, which are either water-soluble or moisture-sensitive.
*Good oxygen permeability.
*Good ultra-violet resistance but poor resistance to acids and bases.
*Soluble in chloroform and other chlorinated hydrocarbons.
*Biocompatible and hence is suitable for medical applications.
*Melting point 175 °C., and glass transition temperature 2 °C.
*Tensile strength 40 MPa, close to that of polypropylene.
*Sinks in water (while polypropylene floats), facilitating its anaerobic biodegradation in sediments.
*Non-toxic.
*Less &#x27;sticky&#x27; when melted.

==History==
Polyhydroxybutyrate was first isolated and characterized in 1925 by French microbiologist Maurice Lemoigne.

==Biodegradation==

Firmicutes and proteobacteria can degrade PHB. &quot;Bacillus&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; and &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species can degrade PHB. &quot;Pseudomonas lemoigne&quot;, &quot;Comamonas&quot; sp. &quot;Acidovorax faecalis&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot; and &quot;Variovorax paradoxus&quot; are soil microbes capable of degradation. &quot;Alcaligenes faecalis&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, and &quot;Illyobacter delafieldi&quot;, are obtained from anaerobic sludge. &quot;Comamonas testosteroni&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas stutzeri&quot; were obtained from sea water. Few of these are capable of degrading at higher temperatures; notably excepting thermophilic &quot;Streptomyces&quot; sp. and a thermophilic strain of &quot;Aspergillus&quot; sp.

<text>Adi Dravida (or Adi Dravidar) is a term that has been used since 1914 in South India to denote Paraiyars. At the time of the 2011 Census of India, they made up about half of Tamil Nadu&#x27;s Scheduled Caste population.

== Origin ==
Iyothee Thass, a leader of the Paraiyar community, believed that the term &quot;Paraiyar&quot; was a slur. He attempted a reconstruction of Tamil history, arguing that the Paraiyars were the original inhabitants of the land, who had been subjugated by upper-caste invaders. Another Paraiyar leader, Rettamalai Srinivasan, however, advocated using the term &quot;Paraiyar&quot; with pride, and formed the Parayar Mahajana Sabha (&quot;Paraiyar Mahajana Assembly&quot;) in 1892. Thass, on the other hand, advocated the term &quot;Adi-Dravida&quot; (&quot;Original Dravidians&quot;) to describe the community. In 1892, he used the term &quot;Adidravida Jana Sabhai&quot; to describe an organisation, which was probably Srinivasan&#x27;s Parayar Mahajana Sabha. In 1895, he established the &quot;People’s Assembly of Urdravidians&quot; (Adidravida Jana Sabha), which probably split off from Srinivasan&#x27;s organisation. According to Michael Bergunder, Thass was thus the first person to introduce the concept of &quot;Adi Dravida&quot; into political discussion.

In 1918, the Adi Dravida Mahajan Sabha also requested the Indian government use the term to replace the current but pejorative term &quot;Pariah&quot; (Paraiyar) used for the community.

Another Paraiyar leader, M C Rajah — a Madras councillor — made successful efforts for adoption of the term &quot;Adi-Dravidar&quot; in the government records. In 1914, the Madras Legislative Council passed a resolution that officially censured the usage of the term &quot;Paraiyar&quot; to refer to a specific community, and recommended &quot;Adi Dravidar&quot; as an alternative. In the 1920s and 1930s, Periyar ensured the wider dissemination of the term &quot;Adi Dravida&quot;.

== Reservation ==
In South India, Adi Dravida are considered as Scheduled Castes, under India&#x27;s positive system of Reservation.
