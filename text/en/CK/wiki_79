<text>Texas&#x27;s 6th congressional district of the United States House of Representatives is in an area that includes Hill, Ellis, Navarro, Anderson, and Cherokee counties to the south and southeast of the Dallas/Fort Worth area plus the southeast corner of Tarrant County, a sliver of Dallas County and northern Freestone County. As of the 2010 census, the 6th district represented 698,498 people. The district is currently represented by Republican Jake Ellzey.

The district was represented by Joe Barton from 1985 until 2019. Other notable representatives include Olin &quot;Tiger&quot; Teague and Phil Gramm. The latter served as a Democrat, then notably resigned and ran as a Republican to win the ensuing special election.

A special election to fill the seat was held on May 1, 2021, with the winner being determined in a July 27 runoff after no candidate received a majority of the vote. In the runoff, Republican state representative Jake Ellzey defeated fellow Republican Susan Wright (the widow of Ron Wright and the endorsee of former President Donald Trump), winning the seat.

<doc id="1141888" wikidata="Q3181130" url="?curid=1141888" title="John Brown (fugitive slave)">
<text>John Brown (c. 1810 – 1876), also known by his slave name, &quot;Fed,&quot; was born into slavery on a plantation in Southampton County, Virginia. He is known for his memoir published in London, England in 1855, &quot;Slave Life in Georgia: A Narrative of the Life, Sufferings, and Escape of John Brown, a Fugitive Slave, Now in England&quot;. This slave narrative, dictated to a helper who wrote it, recounted his life and later escape from slavery in Georgia. He lived in London from 1850 to the end of his life, marrying an English woman.

==Life==
Born in Southampton County, Virginia, to slave parents Joe and Nancy (called Nanny), Fed grew up with his twin siblings, Silas and Lucy. They lived on the plantation of Betty Moore, his mother&#x27;s mistress. He later recalled seeing their father Joe only once, when he was allowed to see the family. His father was held by a planter named Benford in Northampton County. Fed&#x27;s paternal grandfather had been &quot;stolen&quot; from Africa, and he was of the Eboe (Igbo) tribe.

After his father&#x27;s master moved with Joe from the area, Fed&#x27;s mother was forced to take another husband. He was known as Lamb and was held by a nearby planter and miller known as Collier. Nancy had three more children with him: Curtis, Iraene, and Cain. Fed and his family all lived in a two-room cabin, with the other room occupied by his mother&#x27;s niece Annike and her children.

According to the will of Moore&#x27;s husband, when the last of their three daughters married, the &quot;slave property&quot; was to be divided equally among her and the three daughters. There were more than 100 slaves to be divided among the four. Having to leave much family behind, Fed, his mother and brother Curtis were assigned to the lot of the second daughter and her husband, James Davis, and forced to walk to their plantation at Northampton. When Fed was about ten, Davis sold him to a slave trader eager for slaves to take to Georgia, which was rapidly developing. He was sold for about $310 and separated forever from his mother.

In Georgia, Fed was sold to planter Thomas Stevens, a man of Welsh descent, who had a cotton plantation and whiskey still near Milledgeville. He was the maternal grandfather of Mary Ann Harris Gay. She published two works in the late 19th century, a memoir about Atlanta during the Civil War and a novel about antebellum plantation life, set first in Mississippi.

Fed worked under Stevens for more than 15 years, and described the man as &quot;savage&quot; in his treatment. He detailed Stevens&#x27; cruel treatment and regular physical abuse of him and other slaves over the years. After several attempts, Fed escaped, taking the name of John Brown.

Brown made his way North, working in various places. He sailed to England in 1850, as the new Fugitive Slave Law passed in the United States increased enforcement against fugitive slaves even in free states. He did not want to be taken back into slavery. In London, Brown worked as a carpenter. There he contacted the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society to tell his story. In 1855 he dictated a memoir to the society&#x27;s secretary, Louis Alexis Chamerovzow. It was published in London as &quot;Slave Life in Georgia: A Narrative of the Life, Sufferings, and Escape of John Brown, a Fugitive Slave, Now in England&quot;. Brown&#x27;s is one of numerous slave narratives published before and after the Civil War.

Brown married a local Englishwoman. He remained in London until his death, earning a living as a herbalist. He died in London in 1876.

In 2024 Dorset Museum had a display about Brown based on research carried out by Jordan Cole, a student from Bath Spa University. Brown had lived in Dorchester where the museum is located, between 1865 and 1870, and lectured on his experiences of slavery at the Corn Exchange near the museum.

<doc id="1141894" wikidata="Q34075" url="?curid=1141894" title="Maore dialect">
<text>Maore Comorian, or Shimaore (French &quot;Mahorais&quot;), is one of the two indigenous languages spoken in the French-ruled Comorian islands of Mayotte; Shimaore being a dialect of the Comorian language, while ShiBushi is an unrelated Malayo-Polynesian language originally from Madagascar. Historically, Shimaore- and ShiBushi-speaking villages on Mayotte have been clearly identified, but Shimaore tends to be the &quot;de facto&quot; indigenous &quot;lingua franca&quot; in everyday life, because of the larger Shimaore-speaking population. Only Shimaore is represented on the local television news program by Mayotte La Première. The 2002 census references 80,140 speakers of Shimaore in Mayotte itself, to which one would have to add people living outside the island, mostly in metropolitan France. There are also 20,000 speakers of Comorian in Madagascar, of which 3,000 are Shimaore speakers.

The same 2002 census indicates that 37,840 persons responded as knowing how to read or write Shimaore. However this number has to be taken with caution, since it was a few years after this census was taken that a standard writing system was introduced.

From a sociolinguistic perspective, French tends to be regarded by many Shimaore speakers as the language of higher education and prestige, and there is a temptation by native Mahorans to provide an all-French education to their children. This puts a lot of pressure on Shimaore and the language may become endangered in the near future if nothing is done.

Although French remains the official language in Mayotte, Shimaore will probably be taught in Mahoran schools starting in the next few years, and a pilot project began in fall 2004. As in many parts of France where local languages are introduced in the school system, this has led to tensions between partisans of a French-centered education system and administrations, versus those promoting a more diversified approach. Shimaore&#x27;s position in this regard is however different from other French regions (such as Brittany), since the language is locally spoken by a majority of the population. The project in Mayotte has been inspired by similar projects involving Swahili in eastern Africa countries.

Mayotte is a geographically small territory, but frequent exchanges between villages only began in the last quarter of the twentieth century. As of 2004, linguistic differences between the east and west part of the island, and between the main city of Mamoudzou and the remote villages, are still noticeable, especially when it comes to phonological differences. One typical example is the word &quot;u-la&quot; (to eat), notably pronounced this way in the city due to the influence of a brand of yogurt bearing the same name, but pronounced &quot;u-dja&quot; in other parts of the island.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

This language features an unusual contrast between .

===Vowels===
This is a basic five-vowel system similar to that of languages such as Spanish.

==Orthography==

Shimaore was traditionally written with an informal French-based Latin alphabet. On , the &quot;Conseil de la Culture, de l&#x27;Éducation et de l&#x27;Environnement de Mayotte&quot; introduced an official alphabet developed by &quot;Association ShiMé&quot; that utilizes the basic Latin alphabet without c, q, and x and adds three letters: ɓ, ɗ, and v̄. On , the Conseil départemental de Mayotte announced the adoption of official orthographies in both Latin and Arabic scripts for Shimaore.
===Maore Latin Alphabet=== 


===Maore Arabic Alphabet===

Maore Arabic Alphabet, officially recognized alongside Latin since 2020, consists of 35 letters, of which 27 are from the original Arabic script, and 9 are created for sounds not found in Arabic. However, many of the letters in Maore have a different pronunciation than their Arabic counterpart.

Whereas in Arabic there are 3 vowels, in Maore there are 5. While the common convention in Swahili Ajami orthography has been to use two new diacritics, which are modified varieties of two existing diacritics, in Maore Arabic alphabet, only the 3 original Arabic diacritics are used. Arabic vowels themselves represent vowels [a], [u], and [i].

The vowel [o] is created by adding a &quot;waw&quot; &quot;و&quot; and a zero-vowel diacritic (sukun) after the consonant.

The vowel [e] is created by adding a &quot;ya&quot;&#x27; &quot;ي&quot; and a zero-vowel diacritic (sukun) after the consonant.

In Maore Arabic Alphabet, (similar to Swahili Ajami Script) stressed syllables are marked, either with &quot;alif&quot; &quot;ا&quot; (if the vowel of the syllable is [a]), &quot;waw&quot; &quot;و&quot; (if the vowel of the syllable is [u]), or &quot;ya&quot;&#x27; &quot;ي&quot; (if the vowel of the syllable is [i]). These letters are written with no diacritic, not even zero-vowel diacritic (sukun). (the existence or lack thereof of the zero-vowel diacritic is what distinguishes between [e] and a stressed [i]). This does not apply to stressed syllables containing vowels [o] or [e].

In most cases, the stressed syllable happens to be the one before last.

Whereas in Arabic, the letter ʿayn is used as a pharyngeal consonant, in Maore it has a unique role of being the carrier for nasal vowels. Meaning that with the use of diacritics (and the letter &quot;waw&quot; &quot;و&quot; and &quot;ya&quot;&#x27; &quot;ي&quot; as needed), nasal vowels are written.

When non-nasal vowels are at the beginning of a word, &quot;alif-hamza&quot; &quot;أ / إ&quot; is used as a carrier of the appropriate diacritic (followed by the letter &quot;waw&quot; &quot;و&quot; and &quot;ya&quot;&#x27; &quot;ي&quot; as needed.)

<doc id="1141900" wikidata="Q218820" url="?curid=1141900" title="Zolmitriptan">
<text>Zolmitriptan, sold under the brand name Zomig among others, is a serotonergic medication which is used in the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura and cluster headaches. It is taken by mouth as a swallowed or disintegrating tablet or as a nasal spray.
Side effects include neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensations, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. The drug acts as a selective serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonist. Structurally, it is a triptan and a tryptamine derivative.
It was patented in 1990 and was approved for medical use in 1997.

==Medical uses ==
===Migraine===
Zolmitriptan is used for the acute treatment of migraines with or without aura in adults. It is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine.

===Off-label uses===
* Acute treatment of cluster headaches—Level A recommendation from the American Academy of Neurology
* Acute treatment of menstrual migraine

===Available forms===
Zolmitriptan is available as a swallowed tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet, and as a nasal spray, in doses of 2.5 and 5mg. People who get migraines from aspartame should not use the disintegrating tablet (Zomig ZMT) as it contains aspartame.

A 2014 Cochrane review has shown that zolmitriptan 5mg nasal spray was significantly more effective than the 5mg oral tablet.

==Contraindications==
Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease because serotonin 5-HT1B receptors are present in coronary arteries. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. It is also contraindicated in hemiplegic migraine.

==Side effects==
Side effects include neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensations, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth.

As for cardiovascular side effects, zolmitriptan can increase systolic blood pressure in the elderly and increase diastolic blood pressure in both the elderly and young people. Additionally, there is the side effect of a dose-related increase in sedation. There is a risk for medication withdrawal headache or medication overuse headache.

Zolmitriptan has a weak affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A receptors; these receptors have been implicated in the development of serotonin syndrome.

==Interactions==
Following administration of cimetidine, the elimination half-life and total exposure of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Zolmitriptan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonist with weak affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. It also has affinity for other serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2B, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors. Conversely, its affinities for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, and 5-HT6 receptors are negligible or undetectable.

Its action on serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors causes vasoconstriction in intracranial blood vessels; as well it can inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides from trigeminal perivascular nerve endings. It crosses the blood–brain barrier as evidenced by the presence of radiolabeled zolmitriptan within the cells of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and nucleus tractus solitarii.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Zolmitriptan has a rapid onset of action and has been detected in the brain as early as within 5 minutes of intranasal administration. On average, zolmitriptan has an oral bioavailability of 40%, a mean volume of distribution of 8.3 L/kg after oral administration, and 2.4L/kg after intravenous administration. According to a study of healthy volunteers, food intake seems to have no significant effect on the effectiveness of zolmitriptan in both men and women.

Zolmitriptan is a more lipophilic compound with greater central permeability than certain other triptans like sumatriptan. It has been found to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system both in animals and humans. In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, brain concentrations were about 20% of plasma concentrations. However, in another clinical study, the drug achieved relatively low occupancy of central serotonin 5-HT1B receptors (4–5%) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

Zolmitriptan is metabolized into three major metabolites by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes—primarily CYP1A2. Two-thirds of the parent compound breaks down into the active metabolite &quot;N&quot;-desmethylzolmitriptan (183C91), while the remaining one-third separates into the other two inactive metabolites: zolmitriptan &quot;N&quot;-oxide and an indole acetic acid derivative. It has an elimination half-life of about 3hours before it undergoes renal elimination; its clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting that there is some renal tubular secretion of the compound.

==Chemistry==
Zolmitriptan is a triptan and a substituted tryptamine. It is specifically the derivative of &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in which the hydrogen atom at position 5 of the indole ring has been substituted with a [(4&quot;S&quot;)-2-oxo-1,3-oxazolidin-4-yl]methyl group.

The experimental log P of zolmitriptan is 1.6 to 1.8. For comparison, the experimental log P of sumatriptan is 0.93. It is much more lipophilic than sumatriptan.

Analogues of zolmitriptan include other triptans like sumatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan.

==Society and culture==
===Brand names===
Zolmitriptan is marketed by AstraZeneca with the brand names Zomig, Zomigon (Argentina, Canada, and Greece), AscoTop (Germany) and Zomigoro (France).

===Economics===
In 2008, Zomig generated nearly $154 million in sales.

AstraZeneca&#x27;s U.S. patent on Zomig tablets expired on November 14, 2012, and its pediatric exclusivity extension expired on May 14, 2013. The patent in certain European countries has already expired too, and generic drug maker Actavis released a generic version in those countries, starting in March 2012.

===Legal status===
In Russia, versions of zolmitriptan which are not registered in the National registry of medications may be regarded as narcotic drugs (derivatives of dimethyltriptamine).

==Research==
===Social deficits and aggression===
Zolmitriptan, in a modified-release formulation with code name &quot;ML-004&quot; (or &quot;ML004&quot;), is under development by MapLight Therapeutics for the treatment of pervasive developmental disorders (e.g., autism), agitation, and aggression. The drug has been found to reduce aggression in rodents and has also been reported to decrease aggression in humans. As of June 2023, zolmitriptan is in phase 2 clinical trials for pervasive developmental disorders, phase 1 clinical trials for agitation, and is in the preclinical stage of development for aggression.

<doc id="1141901" wikidata="Q5499866" url="?curid=1141901" title="Free Haven Project">
<text>The Free Haven Project was formed in 1999 by a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students with the aim to develop a secure, decentralized system of data storage. The group&#x27;s work led to a collaboration with the United States Naval Research Laboratory to develop Tor, funded by DARPA.

==Distributed anonymous storage system==

The Project&#x27;s early work focused on an anonymous storage system, Free Haven, which was designed to ensure the privacy and security of both readers and publishers. It contrasts Free Haven to anonymous publishing services to emphasize persistence rather than accessibility. Free Haven is a distributed peer-to-peer system designed to create a &quot;servnet&quot; consisting of &quot;servnet nodes&quot; which each hold fragments (&quot;shares&quot;) of documents, divided using Rabin&#x27;s Information dispersal 
algorithm such that the publisher or file contents cannot be determined by any one piece. The shares are stored on the servnet along with a unique public key. To recover and recreate the file, a client broadcasts the public key to find fragments, which are sent to the client along anonymous routes. For greater security, Free Haven periodically moves the location of shares between nodes.

Its function is similar to Freenet but with greater focus on persistence to ensure unpopular files do not disappear. The mechanisms that enable this persistence, however, are also the cause of some problems with inefficiency. A referral- or recommendation-based &quot;metatrust&quot; reputation system built into the servnet attempts to ensure reciprocity and information value by holding node operators accountable. Although nodes remain pseudonymous, communication is facilitated between operators through anonymous email.

==Work with Tor==

Tor was developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory and the Free Haven Project to secure government communications, with initial funding from the US Office of Naval Research and DARPA. Tor was deployed in 2003, as their third generation of deployed onion routing designs. In 2005, the Electronic Frontier Foundation provided additional funding to the Free Haven Project. In 2006, the Tor Project was incorporated as a non-profit organization.

<doc id="1141908" wikidata="Q5232257" url="?curid=1141908" title="David Caygill">
<text>David Francis Caygill (born 15 November 1948) is a former New Zealand politician. He was born and raised in Christchurch. He entered politics in 1971 as Christchurch&#x27;s youngest city councillor at the age of 22. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1978 to 1996, representing the Labour Party. A supporter of Rogernomics, he served as Minister of Finance between 1988 and 1990. From 2010 to 2019, he was one of the government-appointed commissioners at Environment Canterbury.

==Early life and family==
Caygill was born in Christchurch on 15 November 1948, the son of Gwyneth Mary Caygill (née Harris) and Bruce Allot Caygill. He was educated at St Albans Primary School and Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School, and then studied at the University of Canterbury, graduating Bachelor of Arts in 1971 and Bachelor of Laws in 1974. In 1971 Caygill was President of the University of Canterbury Students&#x27; Association from 1975 to 1978.

In 1974, he married Eileen Ellen Boyd, and the couple went on to have four children. From 1975 to 1978 he practised law with a Christchurch legal firm.

==Political career==
Caygill&#x27;s early political philosophies were aligned with the National Party and he chaired the St Albans branch of the Young Nationals as a schoolboy. His allegiance switched to Labour in part due to its stance against the Vietnam War, which he also opposed.

===Local-body politics===
Upon the urging of Neville Pickering, Caygill successfully ran for the Christchurch City Council in 1971, and served until 1980. On 29 April 1974, he became the city&#x27;s youngest ever acting Mayor for a period of five days. He was chair of the council&#x27;s staff and community services committee.

From 1977 to 1980 he was a member of the Canterbury Regional Planning Authority and was chairman of the Authority&#x27;s air pollution committee. He was also a council member of Christchurch Polytechnic.

===Member of Parliament===


Caygill was first elected to Parliament at the 1978 general election as MP for the Christchurch electorate of St Albans. He served for six terms. Caygill was described as one of the most energetic new members elected at the 1978 election. Just under a year later in a reshuffle in October 1979 Caygill was promoted by Labour leader Bill Rowling and given the economic development portfolio.

In March 1981 he had his responsibilities switched and was instead appointed Shadow Minister of Local Government. His duties changed again in February 1982 and he became Shadow Minister of Energy. When David Lange replaced Rowling leader he appointed Caygill as Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry in March 1983.

====Lange Ministry (1984–1989)====
When the Fourth Labour Government was formed after the 1984 elections, Caygill aligned himself with Roger Douglas, the controversial Minister of Finance. Douglas, Caygill, and Richard Prebble were together dubbed &quot;the Treasury Troika&quot;, and were responsible for most of the economic reform undertaken by the Labour government. The &quot;Rogernomics&quot; reforms, which were based on free market economic theory, were unpopular with many traditional Labour supporters, but Caygill managed to avoid the worst of the condemnation directed towards Douglas and Prebble. When the two became founding members of the ACT New Zealand political party in 1994, Caygill chose not to join them.

Caygill was appointed by the new Prime Minister, David Lange, as Minister of Trade and Industry, and Minister of National Development, on 26 July 1984. 

The government opened up and liberalised the New Zealand economy and Caygill&#x27;s portfolios were heavily affected. In early 1986 import controls were lifted on 340 products and relaxed on many others, removing the restrictions on the value or quantity of these goods which may be imported. Following the release of a 1987 report from a working group on tariffs, Caygill announced that tariffs on goods not subject to industry plans would be reduced in a five-step programme over four years. New Zealand had been a highly protected economy but transitioned to a lower tariff environment with reduced protectionism. In 1987, after Labour had been re-elected, he was appointed Minister of Health. As health minister he rejected the orthodoxy of the Gibbs report, which sought to create a more competition oriented hospital service.

====Minister of Finance (1988–1990)====
When Douglas was fired by Prime Minister Lange, Caygill was appointed Minister of Finance in his place. After Lange himself had resigned, Caygill retained his position under both Geoffrey Palmer and Mike Moore, Lange&#x27;s short-lived successors as Prime Minister. As finance minister he passed the &quot;inflation busting&quot; Reserve Bank Act. He also became Minister of Revenue, but dropped the health portfolio. His approach to the finance role was less confrontational and radical than his predecessor, with one Labour MP saying &quot;We approve much more of what David Caygill wants than we would have with Roger Douglas, because he doesn’t bully us and tell us the economy&#x27;s going to fall apart if we don&#x27;t do it.&quot; When Lange resigned as Prime Minister in 1989, Caygill ruled out standing for Prime Minister saying it was &quot;an appalling job&quot; and that he was enjoying his current role as Finance Minister.

Caygill was a reluctant supporter of the Government&#x27;s privatisation programme, particularly selling the Bank of New Zealand. Thinking privatisation a political liability, he remained committed to it believing it necessary to pay back $14 billion of public debt. In his last budget as Minister of Finance in 1990, Caygill lifted the quarantining of rental losses on investment property, allowing an investor to offset losses on their investment property against their other taxable income. Caygill was described as a consummate back-room politician; &quot;Calm, utterly discreet, yet equally forceful, he [Caygill] is said to have people march angrily into his room then leave it an hour later smiling — even if they have lost the argument.&quot;

====Opposition (1990–1996)====
After the defeat of the Fourth Labour Government in November 1990 Caygill became Shadow Minister of Finance. In December 1991 Caygill was replaced as finance spokesperson by Michael Cullen, who was more moderate in his economic policies. Caygill continued to hold a senior position in the Labour Party and was instead appointed Shadow Minister of Justice and Energy.

After Labour&#x27;s narrow defeat at the 1993 election, Helen Clark won the leadership of the party. At the same time Caygill replaced her as deputy leader defeating Cullen by the narrow margin of 23 votes to 21. He cited Sir Geoffrey Palmer as a role model for his deputy leadership. Under Clark he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition as well as Shadow Attorney-General. In June 1995 after Labour MP Margaret Austin defected from Labour to form a new party, United New Zealand, Caygill replaced her as Shadow Minister of Education. He supported Clark in an attempt to oust her as leader in favour of frontbencher Phil Goff in the lead up to the 1996 election.

Over the course of the parliamentary term Caygill had been privately contemplating retiring from politics. On 7 June he informed Clark that he had decided to stand down at the election. Caygill announced his retirement on 11 June 1996 to a surprised caucus, after which Cullen was elected as his successor as deputy leader unopposed. He said there had been no pressure on him to quit but hoped it would provide the &quot;circuit-breaker&quot; to Labour&#x27;s troubles. At the 1996 election, Caygill retired from Parliament.

==Life after politics==

After leaving politics, Caygill returned to his original occupation, law. For some time, he was a partner at Buddle Findlay, a prominent law firm. He also worked for a number of government bodies, and was chair of the Accident Compensation Corporation. He chaired a ministerial inquiry into the New Zealand electricity market in 2000, and was appointed chairman of the Electricity Commission in 2007. He is a board member of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority. He is the chair of the Education New Zealand Trust.

From 2010 to 2019, Caygill was one of the commissioners at Environment Canterbury appointed by the National Government. He held the role of deputy chair. Caygill was appointed, in December 2010, as the Chair of the 2011 NZ ETS Review Panel.

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Caygill was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1997 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services. He was conferred an honorary Doctor of Commerce degree by Victoria University of Wellington in 2004.

<text>The Multiple-purpose Vehicle or MPV is a purpose-built departmental derivative of a diesel multiple unit. Twenty-five two-car units were ordered by Railtrack to enable it to replace its varied collection of ageing departmental vehicles, many of which were converted from redundant passenger stock.

The vehicles were built in Germany by Windhoff. The design is based on the Windhoff &quot;CargoSprinter&quot; units that are operated by Deutsche Bahn (Germany) and CRT Group (Australia). Normally a unit consists of one powered vehicle fitted with twin Railpac diesel engines, semi-permanently coupled to an unpowered slave unit without engines. The later orders for the South East of England and for overhead line replacement are instead composed of two powered units, to give better acceleration and top speed. When first built there were problems with the vehicles being &#x27;out of gauge&#x27; when running empty.

The concept of the design is that each vehicle has a driving cab and an under floor engine/transmission with Multiple unit (MU) control. The majority of each vehicle is a flat load bed that can carry combinations of 10-foot and 20-foot modules that are secured using the locking system for ISO standard containers. Modules can be changed as required to suit current requirements.

In 2005, two powered MPV units were used to form a &quot;Freight Multiple Unit&quot; for freight trials, made by coupling standard freight wagons in between the pair of MPV units. Temporary multiple unit control cables were run along the wagons in order to connect the two MPVs, which are acting as locomotives working as a push-pull train.

==Variants==
There are five distinct types of MPV unit that represent the development of the concept for use in the UK. All are owned by Network Rail.

===High output wiring train===

For the replacement of overhead lines on the West Coast Main Line at the start of the 2000s, Railtrack designed and ordered two new self-powered High Output Wiring Trains (HOWT). The order was placed with Windhoff in July 1999 and the first train available for trials in Germany in June 2000 before being shipped to the United Kingdom shortly afterwards. The replacement program using the new trains began in November 2000.

Replacement of a tensioned overhead span measuring 1000–1500 metres takes four hours with a HOWT, compared to sixteen hours for original method (using rolling stock and road-rail vehicles). Up to 30 crew are required to operate the HOWT.

The full train comprises nine vehicles; four MPV CargoSprinter-based units and five flatbed units. All of the units were designed to accept standard shipping container modules, secured with standard ISO twistlock clamps, allowing modules to be transferred as needed. After the full train has arrived at the work site it is split into five sections. The sections follow each other along the length of wire to be replaced, each performing a step in the wiring renewal process, according to the modules it carries:

# Old wire recovery
#* MPV unit (short working platform), facing forwards
#* Flatbed unit (old wire cable drums)
# Catenary cleanup
#* Flatbed unit (long working platform)
#* Flatbed unit (long working platform)
# New wire deployment and tensioning
#* Flatbed unit (new wire cable drums)
#* MPV unit (short working platform), facing backwards
# Registration and alignment
#* MPV unit (short working platform), facing forwards
#* Flatbed (long working platform)
# Measuring and recording
#* MPV unit (recording/pantograph cabin; rotating working platform), facing backwards

At the end of February 2003, a total of 650 wire lengths had been replaced by the two trains. Two conventional wiring trains would have taken over seven years, as the conventional trains would be limited to one single sixteen-hour engineering possession per week (only available at weekends). The cost of each of the two trains was £3.3 million.

===Welsh freight trials===
For a five-week period beginning in March 2005, trials were undertaken in Wales, transporting timber from Aberystwyth to a wood-chip factory at Chirk.

The daily service, arrived at Aberystwyth at 09:22, allowed approximately 2.5 hours for loading of the timber and then departed, loaded, at 11:50 as 6Z21. On the single-track Cambrian Line the freight service was timed to follow in the footsteps of a regular passenger service to avoid potentials for delay. The combined freight multiple unit (FMU) reversed in platform three at Wrexham General railway station and continued to the Kronospan private siding at Chirk.

The formation used the two halves of an MPV pair, sandwiched around seven open-sided air-braked timber (OTA) wagons. The MPV vehicles are normally designed to carry a combination of short shipping containers, and for the trial, one specially built containerised timber carrying module was constructed for the trial at a cost of around £15,000 and mounted on MPV DR98919. For the trial, the other MPV vehicle (DR98916) carried a water-tank module for ballast. MPV units normally operate as pair consisting of a powered unit and an unpowered trailer; for the timber trials, both of the MPV units were powered versions. Additional mobile cab signalling equipment had to be carried.

The trial had been scheduled to being on 3 March 2005. The first trip took place on 5 March 2005 and continued on weekdays until 1 April 2005. Loading at the Aberystwyth end was done with the train directly on the running line as no suitable terminal facilities were available and could be managed in as little as 90 minutes, with the use of three lorries delivering the timber supply.

Out of the twenty-five scheduled journeys in the trial, nineteen were run, transporting a total of 2845 tonnes of timber (an average of 150–154 tonnes per trip). Loading capacity was reduced on the first journey by an imposed requirement by Network Rail to tow a British Rail Class 37 at the rear of the train as insurance up the thirteen-mile 1-in-47 incline at Talerddig.

===Switches and Crossings video train===

Double-ended single-unit MPV number DR98008 is used by the Network Rail Asset Information department as a track geometry and video train. In the Manchester area the unit is allowed to operate permissively throughout all station areas, replacing a large number of walked inspections.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 3 December 2006, an MPV ran away following a collision with a tree. Similar to the later October 2017 incident, debris activated the brake release mechanism on the MPV, but was exacerbated by the operator failing to set the hand brake before dismounting to inspect the MPV for damage.
*On 22 March 2016, an MPV ran away on the East Lancashire Railway and entered Manchester Metrolink tracks, where it was derailed on catch points.
*On 17 October 2017, an MPV performing leaf removal duties near Markinch, Fife collided with a tree across the line. The accident damaged the MPV&#x27;s braking system, causing the train to run away for . Two crew sustained slight injuries jumping from the train. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch released their report into the incident on 11 January 2018. The RAIB determined that debris from the tree strike activated a brake release mechanism on the MPV. The debris also separated all three brake hoses, which prevented the driver from reactivating the brakes.
*On 15 August 2021, an MPV collided at low speed with a rail grinder in the Thames Tunnel, part of High Speed 1.
*On 16 November 2023, MPV DR97012 collided with tamper DR73916, which was being coupled to MPV DR97011 at the time. One person was injured. The accident occurred on High Speed 1 near Strood, Kent.

<doc id="1141916" wikidata="Q320786" url="?curid=1141916" title="Wojciech Pszoniak">
<text>Wojciech Zygmunt Pszoniak (: ; 2 May 1942 – 19 October 2020) was a Polish film and theatre actor as well as theatre director and pedagogue. He received international recognition for portraying Moritz Welt in Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s drama film &quot;The Promised Land&quot;. In 2016, he won the Polish Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Life and career==
Pszoniak was born in Lwów, Nazi occupied Poland, now in Ukraine. He gained international visibility following Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;The Promised Land&quot;, in which he played Moritz, one of the three main characters.

The actor left Poland during the period of political unrest in 1980–81, when the Solidarity trade union began and was ended by the imposition of martial law on 13 December 1981. Pszoniak found roles in France, where he was living and working. After the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, Pszoniak appeared in Polish movies and plays.

Internationally, he simplified his first name into &quot;Wojtek&quot;, which is the standard diminutive of the relatively formal &quot;Wojciech&quot; in the Polish language.

Pszoniak often played Jewish characters, although he was not of Jewish descent. In France, this was partially attributable to his role in &quot;The Promised Land&quot;, as well as his foreign accent.

Pszoniak did not speak French when he emigrated to France, so he learned his theatrical lines phonetically; in movies like &quot;Danton&quot;, where he played Robespierre, his voice was dubbed. An anecdote about his language skills relates that when he started speaking French, one director told him that he preferred his old accent.

In 1990, Gustaw Holoubek ranked Pszoniak among the three greatest Polish dramatic actors post-1965 alongside Andrzej Seweryn and Piotr Fronczewski.

He died in Warsaw, aged 78.

<text>Frederick George Abberline (8 January 1843 – 10 December 1929) was a British chief inspector for the London Metropolitan Police. He is best known for being a prominent police figure in the investigation into the Jack the Ripper serial killer murders of 1888.

==Early life==
Born in Blandford Forum, Dorset, England, Abberline was the youngest son of Edward Abberline, a saddlemaker, sheriff&#x27;s officer and clerk of the market, minor local government positions; and his wife Hannah ( Chinn). Edward Abberline died in 1849, and his widow opened a small shop and brought up her four children, Emily, Harriett, Edward and Frederick, alone.

==Police career==
Frederick was a clockmaker until he left home to go to London, where he enlisted in the Metropolitan Police on 5 January 1863, being appointed to N Division (Islington) with the Warrant Number 43519. PC Abberline so impressed his superiors that they promoted him to Sergeant two years later on 19 August 1865. On his promotion he moved to Y Division (Highgate). Throughout 1867 he investigated Fenian activities as a plainclothes officer. He was promoted to Inspector on 10 March 1873, and three days later, on 13 March, transferred to H Division in Whitechapel. On 8 April 1878 Abberline was appointed Local Inspector in charge of H Division&#x27;s CID.

On 26 February 1887 Abberline transferred to A Division (Whitehall), and then moved to CO Division (Central Office) at Scotland Yard on 19 November 1887, being promoted to Inspector First-Class on 9 February 1888 and to Chief Inspector on 22 December 1890. Following the murder of Mary Ann Nichols on 31 August 1888, Abberline was seconded back to Whitechapel due to his extensive experience in the area. He was placed in charge of the various detectives investigating the Ripper murders. Chief Inspector Walter Dew, then a detective constable in Whitechapel&#x27;s H Division in 1888, knew Abberline and, while describing him as sounding and looking like a bank manager, also stated that his knowledge of the area made him one of the most important members of the Whitechapel murder investigation team.

Among the many suspects in the case, Abberline&#x27;s primary suspect was George Chapman (Severin Antoniovich Klosowski). That theory was reiterated decades later by Robert Milne, who had recently retired from the Metropolitan Police Directorate of Forensic Services. He presented a paper about the case to the International Association for Identification Conference in 2011 and to the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences in 2014, suggesting Chapman as the most likely the Ripper. Based on his expertise, review of investigation documents, and the use of geographical profiling software, he was convinced that the killer lived in the area of the murders. Chapman fit that bill accurately. Milne also pointed out that Chapman &quot;a now known serial poisoner of women&quot; ... &quot;would go out carrying a small bag, not coming home until 4:30 a.m.&quot;, according to his estranged wife. In his 2014 paper, Milne also discussed a 1902 murder victim (1901 according to some sources), Mary Ann Austin, who had described a client before her death. According to Milne, &quot;a Russian 5ft 7 inches tall with a black moustache [who] visited Mary and in the course of having sex stabbed her and tried to cut out her uterus&quot;. (Austin died of ten wounds to her abdomen, inflicted at Annie Chapman&#x27;s former home, Crossingham&#x27;s Lodging House, at 35, Dorset Street.)

Among Abberline&#x27;s theories about the murders, one suggested that the crimes could have been perpetrated by a female killer.

Abberline was subsequently involved in the investigation of the Cleveland Street scandal in 1889. This case left him disenchanted with police work, convinced that there had been cover-ups by his superiors; if so, this was because, during the investigation, some sources claimed that the Duke of Clarence, Queen Victoria&#x27;s grandson, had been a frequent visitor to the homosexual brothel on Cleveland Street. That was Abberline&#x27;s last major case.

Chief Inspector Abberline retired from the police on 8 February 1892, having received 84 commendations and awards.

==Personal life==
Abberline was married twice: once in March 1868 to 25-year-old Martha Mackness, the daughter of a labourer, from Elton, Northamptonshire; she died of tuberculosis two months after the marriage. On 17 December 1876 Abberline married 32-year-old Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant, from Hoxton New Town, Shoreditch. The marriage lasted until Frederick&#x27;s death over 50 years later. They had no children.

On his retirement from the Metropolitan Police, he returned to Bournemouth and was hired by the Pinkerton Detective Agency in 1904. Initially, he worked in casinos in Monte Carlo to find customers who were cheating. He then returned to England and continued working for the agency, until another retirement in 1904. He then bought a home, &quot;Estcourt&quot;, 195 Holdenhurst Road, Springbourne, Bournemouth.

Abberline died on 10 December 1929, aged 86, just under three months before his wife Emma, and was buried in Bournemouth at Wimborne Road Cemetery. A blue plaque commemorating Abberline was unveiled at 195 Holdenhurst Road (now divided into flats) on 29 September 2001. In 2007, following a campaign for Abberline&#x27;s unmarked grave to be recognised, and with the approval of his surviving relatives, a black granite headstone, inscribed and donated by a local stonemason, was erected on the grave where Abberline and Emma are buried.

==In film and fiction==
Several fictional retellings of the events surrounding the Jack the Ripper murders have cast Abberline in a lead role. The suggestion is often but erroneously made for the sake of drama that Abberline was unmarried and formed an attachment to one of the women connected to the events. The two most popular film depictions have also cast him as an addict, for which there is no known historical basis.

* Abberline was played by Michael Caine in the 1988 television miniseries &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. In this, the character was an aging alcoholic whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking.
* A fictionalized Abberline was featured as the protagonist of Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;From Hell&quot; (1991–1999), and was subsequently portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film adaptation of that work (2001). The graphic novel paints him as a sulky but sympathetic policeman, different from his peers only in his moralism and being overweight, and takes pains to include little-known details of his life such as his involvement with the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. The film&#x27;s version of Abberline was portrayed as an intelligent young detective who is ahead of his time in his deductive techniques. He is also portrayed as being clairvoyant, allowing the film-makers to ascribe to Abberline the contributions of spiritualist and psychic Robert James Lees, thus combining the two into one character and simplifying the graphic novel&#x27;s narrative. Although Abberline is addicted to opium and drinks absinthe, he is a decent man who ultimately goes on a crusade against very powerful governmental and upper-class figures (the Monarchy and the Free Masons) to stop the grotesque murders of Jack the Ripper. In the film, Abberline also has a close relationship with Mary Kelly. The Ripper (a royal physician and Mason) kills a woman suspected to be Kelly, who Abberline helps to escape/relocate to prevent her from being killed by the Masons after the Ripper is defeated. Abberline, who has strong feelings for Kelly, is forced to never see her again out of fear that she will be discovered. He dies shortly thereafter of an opium overdose, which is implied to be suicide, or at least known to be a possibility, due to coins found in his hand intended for the boatman. In reality, he died of natural causes aged 86.
* Abberline was played by Gordon Christie in the 1973 television miniseries &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;.
* In &quot;The Ripper&quot;, an episode of the television series &quot;The Collector&quot;, Abberline was played by Robert Wisden.
* Abberline appears as a character in the anime series &quot;Black Butler&quot; named &quot;Fred Abberline&quot;. While he is still involved in the Jack the Ripper case, this portrayal deviates heavily from the truth, not only by altering his family history (not married but engaged and with a twin brother), but also by placing his death sometime in 1889. However, the manga version of the story (and also the musicals) depicts him like a young enthusiastic and naive Scotland Yard agent who will become the successor of Lord Randall, the actual leader of Scotland Yard.
* Abberline, renamed Francis Aberline, appears as a major character in &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, played by Hugo Weaving.
* In the Fantasy Flight Games board game, Letters from Whitechapel (2011), Frederick Abberline features as a playable policeman - in which he has a corresponding portrait (under the name &#x27;Frederich Abberline&#x27;). His colour scheme is red. Abberline even gains a unique set of traits in the Dear Boss expansion (2017).
* In BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Ripper Street&quot; (2012), Abberline is played by Clive Russell.
* In the 2015 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate&quot;, set in 1868, a young Abberline is featured as a supporting character, helping the protagonists, Evie and Jacob Frye, capture various Templar criminals throughout London and foil a plot to assassinate Queen Victoria by main antagonist, Crawford Starrick. Additionally, in the DLC named &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, set in 1888, Evie Frye helps Abberline solve a set of brutal murders committed by the infamous maniac to find her brother, Jacob.
* In the seventh series of the &quot;Jago and Litefoot&quot; science-fiction audio plays produced by Big Finish, Abberline appears as a character portrayed by Adrian Rawlins. In this story, Abberline is portrayed as having secretly captured &#x27;Jack The Ripper&#x27;, and recruits the title characters to help him in quietly recapturing the murderer after his escape.

<text>Texas&#x27;s 7th congressional district of the United States House of Representatives comprises a small area of southwestern Houston and Harris County, along with a northern portion of suburban Fort Bend County. As of the 2000 census, the 7th district comprises 651,620 people. Since 2019, it has been represented by Democrat Lizzie Fletcher.

Before 2022, the district was largely viewed as a wealthy, traditionally Republican district covering much of western Houston and surrounding suburbs. The district&#x27;s best known congressman was George H. W. Bush, who later became the 41st president of the United States and retired to the district after his presidency.

== Recent election results from statewide races ==
==Composition==
For the 118th and successive Congresses (based on redistricting following the 2020 census), the district contains all or portions of the following counties and communities:

Fort Bend County (5)
: Four Corners, Houston (part; also 2nd, 8th, 9th, 18th, 22nd, 29th, 36th, 38th; shared with Harris and Montgomery counties), Mission Bend (shared with Fort Bend County), Richmond (part; also 22nd), Sugar Land (part; also 22nd)
Harris County (6)

==History==

Texas received a seventh congressional district through reapportionment in 1881 as a result of population growth reflected in the 1880 census; in 1883, Thomas P. Ochiltree, an Independent, was elected its first representative. From 1882 to 1902 the district was located in north central Texas and was represented by Wacoan Robert L. Henry. After the redistricting of 1902, the district shifted eastward and was represented by Congressmen from Palestine and Galveston. After 1952, the district again shifted to Waco. From 1885 to 1966, the seventh congressional district elected only Democratic representatives to Congress.

In 1966 the district, then represented by John Dowdy of Waco, was redrawn after the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; two years earlier that congressional district populations had to be equal or close to equal in population. As a result, the old 7th essentially became the new 2nd district, while a new 7th was created in the western portion of Harris County, home to Houston. Previously, Harris County had been divided between the 8th and 22nd congressional districts. The new 7th stretched from downtown Houston through its fast-growing west side (including the Memorial Villages) out to what were then mostly rural western sections of Harris County including the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, the Katy Prairie and FM 1960. These were among the first areas of Greater Houston to turn Republican as Texas began to gradually shift towards the GOP.

The mid-decade redistricting resulted in the election of George H. W. Bush, a former chairman of the Harris County Republican Party and the son of former Connecticut U.S. senator Prescott Bush, and who unsuccessfully sought the state&#x27;s Class 1 Senate seat against Democrat Ralph Yarborough in 1964. Bush would go on to hold the district for two terms before making an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate in 1970, losing to Lloyd Bentsen who defeated Yarborough in an upset in the Democratic primary. Bush would eventually go on to become vice president under Ronald Reagan and in 1988 would be elected president. After losing the 1992 election to Bill Clinton, Bush would retire to the 7th where he continued to reside until his death in 2018.

Bush was succeeded by fellow Republican Bill Archer, who would go on to represent the district for 15 terms. Archer would never drop below 79% of the vote as the 7th district, now stretching from the prosperous west side of Houston, including such neighborhoods as River Oaks, Tanglewood, Briargrove, the Energy Corridor and the Memorial Villages, to fast-growing suburbs in the Cypress-Fairbanks and Katy areas and along FM 1960, became reckoned as the most Republican district in the Greater Houston area and arguably one of the most Republican districts in the nation. Archer would rise to prominence in 1994 following the Republican Revolution in which Republicans gained control of the House for the first time in 40 years, with Archer serving as chairman of the influential House Ways and Means Committee for his final three terms.

In 2000, Archer retired from Congress, leading to a highly competitive Republican primary - traditionally the real contest in the heavily Republican district. In the ensuing runoff, State Representative John Culberson, who represented much of the congressional district&#x27;s western portion, defeated opponent Peter Wareing to win the Republican nomination. By 2002, the district was further reduced in size, now taking in the west side of Houston as well as much of the unincorporated vicinity of the Barker and Addicks reservoirs in west Houston.

Following a controversial 2004 mid-decade redistricting, the district lost Katy and the immediate Barker Reservoir, while also gaining some neighborhoods surrounding Jersey Village and (most penultimately) a southwest section of Houston that encompassed Rice University, the center-right inner suburbs of Bellaire and West University Place, the historically Jewish neighborhood of Meyerland and the historically liberal Montrose area. The latter portion made up the political base of freshman Democratic congressman Chris Bell&#x27;s 25th district, and historically had not been associated with the 7th during Archer&#x27;s tenure. While the 7th remained heavily Republican, its dominance was not as strong as in previous elections because of the redistricting. Meanwhile, the bulk of Bell&#x27;s district had been renumbered as the 9th district and reconfigured as a majority-minority district. Instead of running against Culberson, Bell ran in the Democratic primary for the reconfigured 9th losing to Al Green. Meanwhile, Culberson would go on to win reelection in the 7th against a nominal Democratic challenger in 2004, and won again with under 60 percent of the vote in 2006 in what was considered a bad year for Republicans who lost control of the House for the first time in 12 years.

After the 2012 redistricting process, the 7th lost some of its territory to the adjacent 2nd district of Republican Ted Poe, losing a stretch of territory stretching from north of Jersey Village through Memorial Park to Rice University. In exchange, Culberson gained much of the Greater Katy area south of Interstate 10, as well as a stretch of middle-class suburban areas along the western edge of Highway 6 that had growing Hispanic populations, which also existed in the Sharpstown and Gulfton areas of southwest Houston that were also added to Culberson&#x27;s district.

Despite the changes, Culberson continued to win reelection in his three successive elections, beating Democratic opponent James Cargas in three consecutive elections from 2012 to 2016. However, the district was one of 23 congressional districts that voted for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 after voting Mitt Romney in 2012, due in part to backlash from some constituents of Republican Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign rhetoric and stances on such issues as trade and immigration. District residents&#x27; favoritism towards free trade and comprehensive immigration reform clashed with Trump&#x27;s populist stances on these issues. The district swung 23 percent to the left from 2012, more than any other in the nation outside of Utah. Combined with demographic changes in parts of the district as well as the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which caused catastrophic damage to many parts of the district in 2017, some political analysts argued the district could be vulnerable to a Democratic takeover in a wave election.

For the 2022 elections, in order to protect surrounding Republican incumbents, the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature redrew the 7th into a heavily Democratic district connecting northern portions of Fort Bend County (including western parts of Sugar Land with largely Asian-American populations) with much of the Westpark Tollway corridor of southwest Houston and Harris County (including the Alief and Mission Bend areas), along with much of inner western Houston inside Loop 610 including portions of the Heights, Midtown, Montrose, Meyerland, Braeswood Place and Timbergrove Manor neighborhoods, as well as The Galleria, Greenway Plaza and the &quot;island suburbs&quot; of Bellaire, West University Place and Southside Place. Most of the 7th&#x27;s longtime constituency in west Houston, including Memorial City, the Energy Corridor and its entire stretch of the Katy Freeway, as well as the Memorial Villages, Memorial Park, the River Oaks neighborhood and its share of the Greater Katy area, was moved over to the newly drawn 38th District that is expected to strongly favor Republicans, while many of the areas near the Addicks Reservoir (home to large numbers of middle-class Hispanics) were moved into the 8th District. While the new 7th is not as heavily Democratic as the nearby 9th, 18th and 29th districts, Joe Biden won over 60 percent of the vote in the new 7th in 2020 (even though much of the new district was friendlier to Republicans in past elections), securing the district as a safe seat for Fletcher barring any future redistricting challenges or internal factional trends within the Republican Party.

In 2022, Fletcher won a third term in the newly reconfigured 7th District, defeating Republican challenger Johnny Teague; Fletcher&#x27;s 2020 challenger, Wesley Hunt, would himself be elected to the new 38th anchored in the 7th&#x27;s old base in west Houston by a comfortable margin.

In 2008, Culberson defeated wind energy executive Michael Skelly to win a fifth term with 56 percent of the vote, despite being vastly outspent by the latter in a surprisingly competitive race–the first that the district had seen in four decades. He was likely helped by John McCain winning the district with 58 percent of the vote in the presidential election.

=== 2018 ===
In 2018, Culberson ran against corporate litigator Lizzie Fletcher, who prevailed out of a crowded and well-funded Democratic primary that gained national attention when supporters of Fletcher&#x27;s primary runoff opponent, journalist and progressive activist Laura Moser, cried foul over the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&#x27;s supposed preference for Fletcher over Moser in the primary. Despite this controversy, Fletcher prevailed by a comfortable margin in the primary runoff later that May. The race was one of the most closely watched in the nation that year, with Fletcher consistently outraising Culberson throughout the general election. Despite Culberson&#x27;s proactive leadership in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Fletcher defeated Culberson to become the first Democrat to represent the district since its realignment as a Houston-based seat in 1966, as the 7th became one of 43 Republican seats (over 1/6th of the Republican conference) to flip Democratic in the 2018 election. Culberson held his own in his longtime base of west Houston and Memorial, areas that have been the district&#x27;s core for its entire existence in its present configuration; he&#x27;d represented much of this area for over three decades at the state and federal levels. However, Fletcher swamped him in the portions of southwest Houston that were added in the 2004 redistricting, as well as in the Hispanic-plurality Bear Creek area near the Addicks Reservoir that was heavily affected by flooding from Harvey. As a measure of how Republican the district had historically been, Fletcher was only the fourth Democrat to even garner 40 percent of the vote in the district.

<text>William James Perry (1887–1949), usually known as W. J. Perry, was an academic in cultural anthropology at University College, London.

Megalith culture, according to him, was transmitted to the rest of the world from Egypt.

He was a convinced hyperdiffusionist and collaborated with Grafton Elliot Smith. He was also interested in the history of religion. His daughter, a chemist, Margaret, married the eminent physiologist, Professor Robert Harkness.

<text>Falkland Palace, in Falkland, Fife, Scotland, is a royal palace of the Scottish kings. It was one of the favourite places of Mary, Queen of Scots, who took refuge there from political and religious turmoil of her times.

Today it is under the stewardship of Ninian Stuart, who delegates most of his duties to the National Trust for Scotland. The Chapel Royal in the Palace is dedicated to Thomas the Apostle. It is open to the public and reserved for Catholic worship.

==History==

===Early years===

In the late 12th century, a royal hunting lodge was located on this site. The lodge was expanded in the 13th century to operate as a castle, owned by the Earls of Fife of the noted Clan MacDuff. The castle was built here because the site is on a slight hill that could be defended. The surrounding land eventually were developed as the Palace gardens.

To the north, between the royal stable and the River Eden, was a great oak wood. Its many groves merged into the surrounding parkland. Timber was occasionally cut in the forest for royal ships of war.

The castle would have been surrounded by meadows, fields, orchards, glades and Falkland Park, which was a managed forest surrounded by a pale, a ditch with a fence on top of it. The pale would have been used to keep game inside the park reserved for hunting by the royal family and its courtiers. A park keeper maintained the Pale. In 1469 the keeper Bannatyne was docked wages for failing to keep it repaired.

In 1371 Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Fife acknowledged Robert Stewart, Earl of Menteith, son of Robert II, as her heir. She made him keeper of the castle and forest of Falkland. In 1402 Stewart, by then Duke of Albany, imprisoned his nephew and rival David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, at Falkland; he was the eldest son of Robert III. The incarcerated Duke eventually died from neglect and starvation.

Albany was exonerated from blame by the Parliament of Scotland, but suspicions of foul play persisted. These suspicions were carried against Rothesay&#x27;s younger brother, the future King James I. These events eventually led to the downfall of the Albany Stewarts.

After ordering the execution of Albany&#x27;s son Murdoch in 1424, James I took possession of Falkland for the crown. Falkland became a popular retreat with all the Stewart monarchs and queens consort. They practised falconry there and used the vast surrounding forests for hawking. Red deer and fallow deer were kept in the park for hunting, some brought from the Torwood Forest near Stirling.

===Mary of Guelders===
James II of Scotland granted Falkland to his queen consort Mary of Guelders, and the palace or castle became a favourite residence. The stables and other buildings in the close were repaired and a new kitchen was built for the visits of the royal couple in 1453. Linseed, cabbage seed, onion, leek, and other seeds were bought for the garden.

As a widow, Mary of Guelders employed her stewards Henry Kinghorn and William Blair to supervise improvements at Falkland Palace in 1461–2. The works included a stairway from the queen&#x27;s chamber to the pleasance, new stables, a coal shed, repairs and an extension to the counting house, and a smith-made andirons or firedogs for the queen&#x27;s bedchamber and the fire grate of the great hall. The royal carpenter was Andrew Lesouris. New structures included a &quot;galry&quot; with two chambers, apparently the earliest use of the French-derived term &quot;gallery&quot; in Britain.

Works in the grounds included the construction of two ponds in the hay yard. A new lawn was laid near the queen&#x27;s chamber, and a doorway was made for her to access the garden. Such access was popular in this period; in other countries, Margaret of Anjou at Greenwich Palace and Isabella of Portugal at Bruges had access from their lodgings to the gardens. Eleanor of Naples built new lodgings and a terrace garden at Castello Estense in Ferrara.

At Linlithgow Palace, a door leads out to the garden and pele at the foot of what may have been the queen consort&#x27;s tower under the oriel windows of the royal chambers. Mary of Guelders is said to have had a garden walk made between two oak trees, known as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Quarrels&quot;, a name suggestive of the practice of archery, a &quot;quarrel&quot; being a name for a crossbow bolt. Another walk was called the &quot;Gilderland&quot;. The hay meadow of Falkland is regularly mentioned in the royal accounts, as are onions, because the palace gardener&#x27;s pay was based on four barrels of onions.

James III and Margaret of Denmark came to Falkland in September 1473. The court of the Exchequer met at Falkland annually to complete the accounts of the jointure lands of James&#x27;s mother, Mary of Guelders. She may have intended to make Falkland Palace her residence and spiritual retreat in widowhood.

===James IV at Falkland===
Between 1497 and 1541 James IV and James V transformed the old castle and royal lodgings into a beautiful renaissance-style royal palace. James enjoyed imported oranges at Falkland in April 1497 and gave a tip to the gardener and workmen building the dyke around the park. In May 1501 James IV hired two stonemasons from Dundee to work at the palace, and an hourglass was bought for time-keeping. On 13 December 1501 he was entertained at Falkland by the female minstrel Quhissilgibboun, and in September 1504 by fiddlers, lutenists, and an African drummer known as the &quot;More taubronar&quot;. A man from Pittenweem brought a live seal to the castle on 25 September 1502 and James IV gave him 14 shillings in reward.

A new chapel (perhaps on the site of the present south quarter) was roofed in 1512 by Alexander and John Slater, and masons worked on the garden wall. William Thome completed the walls of the great hall. James IV was entertained at Falkland by the &quot;Wild Lady&quot;, who received £10 for her appearances in 1513.

James IV brought deer-nets from Kinneil House in November 1503. Andrew Matheson built a fold for deer in November 1505. A trap was made to &quot;slay foxes in the park of Falkland&quot;. For a time in 1507 the horse of the French herald Montjoie, Gilbert Chauveau, was kept in the palace stables. In May 1508 James IV and John Methven stalked deer in the park with a firearm called a culverin. Later, wild boar, imported from France, were kept in the Park, within a fence made by the Laird of Fernie. Dairy and beef cattle were kept to support the castle population.

===James V and Mary of Guise===
The teenage James V was detained at Falkland Palace by the Earl of Angus and, according to Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, escaped to Stirling Castle which was held by his mother Margaret Tudor. He had announced an early morning deer hunt in the park, but escaped by horse in the middle of the night dressed as a stable hand.

To address the poor state of the garden and park, James V appointed a new Captain and Keeper, William Barclay, Master of Rhynd, in March 1527. The Queen&#x27;s Chamber was hung with tapestry for Margaret Tudor in September 1534. James V extended his father&#x27;s buildings in French renaissance style from 1537. He arranged to build a Royal Tennis Court and bowling alley in the garden in 1541. The tennis court was called a &quot;caichpule&quot; in Scots and the game was known in French as &quot;jeu de paume&quot;. Mary was said to have scandalised the people of Scotland by wearing men&#x27;s breeches to play the game. 
Amidst the building works and renovations, the Scotland court regularly went to Falkland, and in December 1538 and 1540 new velvet and satin gowns were packed in a canvas bag and sent to Falkland as gifts for the Queen&#x27;s ladies in waiting. In February 1539 one of Mary of Guise&#x27;s French courtiers, Marie Pieris, married Lord Seton by handfasting. The French apothecary was also at Falkland on that day. James V held a tournament at Falkland on or around May Day 1539.

Mary of Guise spent time embroidering her husband&#x27;s shirts at Falkland with gold thread in October 1539, and the luggage of her ladies in waiting included embroidery equipment, called &quot;broder warklumys&quot;. James V played cards with Mary of Guise during their visit in April 1540. While they were at the palace, servants washed the clothes of his infant daughter by Elizabeth Beaton, the Lady Jean Stewart. Thomas Melville&#x27;s wife kept the royal family&#x27;s pets. In August Mary of Guise went riding at Falkland in a new cloak of scarlet cloth edged with crimson velvet.

The goldsmith John Mosman made a gilt chalice for the couple&#x27;s short-lived son Prince James, born 1540. In July 1541 they sent the chalice to Falkland to be used in the palace chapel. In the same month wild boar from France arrived. The Laird of Fernie built a new park dyke and a timber-fenced run for the boar. The wild boar came from Elbeuf near Rouen, and Mary of Guise&#x27;s younger brother René II de Lorraine, Marquis d&#x27;Elbeuf later became an enthusiast for the boar hunt with dogs and toiles, known as &quot;le vautrait&quot;. James V kept a kind of menagerie at Falkland, employing Thomas Melville&#x27;s wife to look after the pets.

An inventory recorded a green velvet bed in the wardrobe at Falkland Palace with velvet covered posts, packed in coffers and travel bags called &quot;sowmes&quot;. Robert Murray, the plumber who maintained the fountain at Linlithgow Palace, provided lead work for a long vanished fountain at Falkland.

James V died at Falkland Palace in December 1542, from an illness induced by the shock and grief of his army&#x27;s defeat at Solway Moss. Some say he also grieved his wife&#x27;s failure to give him a male heir, when she instead gave birth to the future Mary, Queen of Scots. His body lay in the Chapel Royal for almost a month and the chapel was draped in black. On 4 January 1543 messengers ordered the gentlemen of Fife to convey the king&#x27;s body to North Queensferry on its way to Holyrood Abbey.

===Reign of Mary, Queen of Scots===

Mary, Queen of Scots was born at Linlithgow Palace and moved to Stirling Castle in July 1543. Her mother, Mary of Guise, sometimes travelled without her to stay at Falkland Palace. Falkland and Stirling palaces were official residences of Mary of Guise as a widow, and she continued to keep wild boars for hunting in Falkland park. Mary of Guise frequently stayed at Falkland, especially in autumn, and was recorded there in October 1546, and in September 1549. A letter, perhaps of 1548, mentions the refurbishment of the stables, the wardrobes, and the lodgings of one of her officials.

Mary of Guise asked the Earl of Bothwell to escort her from Falkland to Stirling Castle for a convention or council in December 1549. In October 1552, Regent Arran (who ruled Scotland on behalf of Mary) wondered if Mary of Guise would come from Falkland for a Privy Council meeting because the palace and town were too small for the number of expected attendees. He wrote, &quot;they will be a great company of folks and can not be easily lodged in Falkland&quot;. Regent Arran&#x27;s daughter, Anne Hamilton, joined Mary of Guise at Falkland in June 1553.

Nearby Myres Castle was the home of the Royal Macers and Sergeants at Arms who served Falkland Castle since at least the 16th century. John Scrimgeour of Myres supervised building at the Palace from 1532 to 1563. He wrote to Mary of Guise about repairs to Falkland and its lead roofs, delayed by the frosts, and the carts he needed to bring stones to the palace and timber from the harbour at Levenmouth. In May 1559 Scrimgeour repaired the stables and hired Adam Symmers to fix the palace windows. He also designed new ditches and fences for the garden.

Mary, Queen of Scots, returned from France in September 1561, and hosted a group of diplomats at Falkland. She held her Maundy Thursday or &quot;Skyris Thurisday&quot; ceremony at Falkland in March 1562, washing the feet of 19 young women. John Balfour bought new linen cloth for the aprons and towels which she gave to the maidens. The number of young women matched her age. Mary came for Easter at Falkland in April 1563 and 1564. The queen&#x27;s many visits to Falkland have been tracked in archival sources.

===James VI and Anne of Denmark===
James VI of Scotland was considered an adult ruler after October 1579. In preparation for his visits to Falkland, a cooper in Leith, William Todd, supplied barrels and brewing equipment for the palace. In April 1582, James VI of Scotland made John Killoch and Robert Schaw keepers of all his tennis courts, and suppliers of his balls and rackets. In June 1583, Schaw spent £100 on refurbishing the court at Falkland.

James VI spent the summer of 1583 at Falkland, and the English diplomat Robert Bowes noted it was a &quot;little house&quot; unsuitable for holding a parliament. In 1584 James VI had the roofs repaired, and requested Agnes Leslie, Lady of Lochleven, and his tenants in Fife to send horses and help carry slates, tiles, timber, sand and lime to the palace. In July and August 1584, James welcomed Albert Fontenay, a French envoy sent by his mother, at Falkland, and lent him a horse to join in the hunting.

James stayed in the palace during the plague in July 1585. For fear of infection, he ordered people with no business in Falkland or at court to stay away. His guests in Fife in the summer of 1585 included the English ambassador Edward Wotton and three Danish envoys who came to discuss the Orkney and Shetland islands and the king&#x27;s marriage.

In August 1586, James VI was at Falkland with the French diplomat Charles de Prunelé, Baron d&#x27;Esneval. In September he received a gift of books and hunting horses from Elizabeth I, and news of the discovery of the Babington Plot. The Master of Gray wrote from Falkland to the Scottish ambassador in London that James was &quot;content for the law to go forward&quot;, if her life was safe.

James VI held a meeting at Falkland in September 1587 to discuss his marriage plans after hearing from his ambassadors that the elder Danish Princess Elizabeth was promised to another.

James VI married the younger Princess Anne of Denmark; he included Falkland in the &quot;morning gift&quot; that he gave to his bride. On 12 May 1590 the Danish ambassadors rode from Wemyss Castle to Falkland to evaluate the palace and her Fife lands. They were welcomed by the keeper James Beaton of Creich. The lawyer John Skene produced a charter of the queen&#x27;s lands and, as a traditional symbol of ownership, the Danish Admiral Peder Munk was given a handful of earth and stone. After this ceremony, they rode to the Newhouse of Lochleven Castle.

The following year, another Danish ambassador Paul Knibbe came to Falkland in July 1591. He brought a Danish gentlewoman, probably Margaret Vinstarr, to join the Queen&#x27;s household. Around this time an African servant of Anne of Denmark, known only as &quot;the Moir&quot; [Moor], died and was buried at Falkland, probably at the kirkyard of Kilgour. He was identified as a &quot;page of the equerry&quot; who wore clothes of orange velvet and Spanish taffeta.

===Raid of Falkland===
For five hours in the morning of 28 June 1592 Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, with the Master of Gray, James Lumsden of Airdrie, the Laird of Niddrie, John Colville, and Spott with others including men from Cumbria attempted to capture the palace and James VI and Anne of Denmark. James VI had been warned of Bothwell&#x27;s approach and had stayed at Falkland rather than go to Perth as he had planned. Bothwell&#x27;s plans had been revealed to the English ambassador in Edinburgh, Robert Bowes, and he had told Richard Cockburn, the Earl of Morton, and the Master of Glamis that the king should &quot;look narrowly about him&quot;. Bothwell crossed the Forth at Queensferry on 27 June with 400 men. The Earl of Erroll and Colonel William Houston were at Falkland and they were arrested on suspicion of being inside-men.

Bothwell&#x27;s men attempted to batter down the back gate but were repulsed by gunshots before midnight on 27 June. The king withdrew to the gatehouse tower and his guard shot at Bothwell&#x27;s men. According to James Melville the defenders who favoured Bothwell loaded their guns with paper rather than bullets. Bothwell abandoned the attack at 7 o&#x27;clock in the morning, and rode away with the king&#x27;s horses. James Sandilands gave chase. He captured nine men whose horses tired, five were hanged in Edinburgh&#x27;s Canongate, the others were ransomed. One of John Colville&#x27;s servants was hanged, a packet of coded letters and a cipher was found in his possession.

The English border reiver Richie Graham of Brackenhill and his companions sacked the town of Falkland, taking horses, clothing, and money. It was said that Bothwell had given a pep talk to his supporters, encouraging them to kill Sir John Carmichael, Sir George Home, and Roger Aston.

A month later it was said that Bothwell was advancing towards Falkland again from Stirling Bridge, and some of his men had landed in boats at a creek near Aberdour Castle. The king was forewarned by Harry Lindsay and prepared for another fight. The Earl of Argyll rode from his wedding party at Dalkeith Palace to help the king. Men in arms were summoned from Edinburgh, Haddington and Linlithgow to fight the rebel earl. However, Robert Bowes was told it was a deliberate false alarm, possibly intended to make the king move from Falkland to a less secure location. Bothwell also attempted to corner the King in Holyroodhouse.

===Palace staff in the 1590s===
The royal couple returned to Falkland in 1593, enjoying five tuns of wine which were shipped to nearby Levenmouth. At this time, James Beaton of Creich was keeper of the palace. Robert Arnot of Kilquhus, Chamberlain of Fife, looked after the park and the meadow, and took receipt of local produce including the onions from the palace garden. Andrew Fairny maintained the dykes and ditches. The tenants of the village of Casch were compensated for damage done by escaped deer. James VI&#x27;s master stabler David Murray kept the king&#x27;s mares and stags in the park. Guilliam looked after the hay, and George Strathauchin was the palace gardener.

===Deer from England===
Queen Elizabeth I sent deer for the park in 1586 and 1587, and again in 1591 from parks near Colchester. These were diplomatic gifts. In May 1586, James VI went to Falkland the deer taken out of carts and set loose in the park. James asked the English ambassador Thomas Randolph for some of Elizabeth&#x27;s huntsmen, Yeoman prickers and Grooms of the leash, and some horses. A Yeoman pricker was employed to manage and guide the hunted deer.

English huntsmen and bucks were sent to James VI in August 1586 by Randolph and the Scottish ambassador in London, Archibald Douglas. Randolph wrote:I have sent the Kynge two hunting men, verie good and skillful, with one footman, that can hoop, hollow and crye, that all the trees in Fawkland will quake for fear. Pray the Kynge&#x27;s Majestie to be mercifull to the poor bucks; but let him spare and look well to himself.

In November 1586, Archibald Douglas wrote to Francis Walsingham that a gift of bucks from Elizabeth might help James with his grief at the forthcoming loss of his mother. In May 1592 the English ambassador Robert Bowes went to Barnard Castle, Raby Castle and Brancepeth Castle with the English-born royal huntsman Cuthbert Rayne to catch deer for James VI and managed to catch only six, which he shipped from Sunderland to Kirkcaldy. In April 1597, the carpenter and &quot;master wright&quot; James Murray was in charge of transporting 28 English deer from Leith to Falkland. Robin the Hunter kept hounds for James at Falkland. Anne of Denmark sent deer hounds as gifts to her brother, Christian IV of Denmark.

===A royal quarrel===

Another Danish commission including Steen Bille and Niels Krag visited in 1593, which resulted in the keeper James Beaton of Creich giving more rights over the lands and buildings to the queen, Anne of Denmark. She came to stay on 12 July 1594 before the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle. It was said she left Edinburgh for Falkland because Holyrood Palace was not magnificent enough to receive the Danish ambassadors Steen Bille and Christian Barnekow.

James VI arranged for Prince Henry to stay at Stirling Castle with the Earl of Mar. This did not suit the queen. Courtiers took sides as the quarrel deepened. In August 1595 James persuaded Anne, who was now reluctant to leave Edinburgh, to come to Falkland and meet the Earl of Mar for a reconciliation. The kirk minister and royal chaplain Patrick Galloway gave a sermon about Adam and Eve and the duties of man and wife to each other, and it was thought that &quot;she gave good ear to his advice&quot;. Another church minister David Lindsay, had a &quot;long conference&quot; with Anne at Falkland, hoping to heal the quarrel. It was said that James were Anne were now &quot;being so lovingly together at Falkland&quot;.

Anne was joined at Falkland by her friend and servant Margaret Vinstarr. She had returned from visiting the queen&#x27;s mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, whose message to her daughter was that she ought to obey her husband&#x27;s will in all things.

=== The witch-hunt of 1597 ===
On 12 August 1597, James VI and his Privy Council gathered at Falkland Palace during the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597 to issue a general proclamation revoking some of the commissions of justiciary against suspected witches. The proclamation came after the contentious commissions based on the evidence of accused witch, Margaret Aitken, who claimed she could detect other witches just by looking at their eyes. With this proclamation, the Order of Council restored duties to James VI which had been delegated as general commissions in 1591, giving local landowners the power to execute accused witches without dispute from central government.

By restoring these powers to the King, the Privy Council hoped to reduce the number of &#x27;innocent&#x27; people killed. However, the order was quite limited in reality, only discrediting commissions presided over by one or two men alone, and it also reiterated James VI&#x27;s determination to continue with the witch-hunt. However, during the trials of the early seventeenth century, the proclamation at Falkland Palace did help to introduce a new regime of restricted witch-hunting, and it demonstrated greater considerations surrounding the evidence needed to condemn a witch.

===Last years as a royal palace===
When Anne of Denmark visited in September 1598 her bed chamber was hung with tapestry brought from Holyroodhouse. Rhenish, &quot;Rence&quot;, wine was brought to Falkland for her. A French ambassador Philippe de Béthune, brother of the Duke of Sully, came in July 1599. The English diplomat Sir William Bowes was reluctant to come to Falkland, where James VI might show more favour to the French ambassador. Béthune fell ill, needing a surgeon and a physician to bleed him. It was rumoured he had been poisoned. He recovered and went on a progress with the king to Inchmurrin and Hamilton Palace, after James VI wrote to the Laird of Wemyss for the loan of his best hackney horse and saddle.

In July 1600 herons nested in the park, and James VI hoping to have them &quot;increase and multiply&quot; forbade anyone to kill herons in neighbouring lands. In August a French acrobat danced on a tightrope in the palace courtyard for the king and the queen.

James VI played cards with the English diplomat George Nicholson at Falkland in May 1602. In September 1602 Anne of Denmark and the Master of Gray entertained Anne de Gondi, the wife of French ambassador the Baron de Tour, at Falkland, while he went on a progress with the king. Lord Henry Howard noted that the Master of Gray had spent this time with Queen Anne and it affected the conceit of his writing style.

David Murray became keeper of the garden, park, and Lomond Hills and was allowed to build a house on the site of the old castle, called the Castlestead or Nether Palace of Falkland. Lord Walden stayed for a night in August 1613. This house was inherited by the next keeper of the park, John Murray, 1st Earl of Annandale. The palace was occasionally used as a prison. In November 1608 James instructed David Murray to keep James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino, prisoner in the tower of the palace, for treasonable correspondence with the Pope. Balmerino was released in October 1609. After hearing Anne of Denmark speak of her love of Scotland, the Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini came to Falkland in September 1613.

===Union of the Crowns===
After the Union of the Crowns in 1603, Andrew Murray of Balvaird kept a watchful eye on the palace and in 1615 he advised John Murray of the bedchamber that the king should send a commission for repairs, because otherwise &quot;it will not fail to fall all to the ground. The back galleries are already decayed&quot;. The architect James Murray repaired the palace for the visit of King James in 1617. Some courtiers were lodged in the house of Nicol Moncrieff, which still stands in Falkland, opposite the palace gate. At the celebrations to welcome the king on 19 May, David Wedderburn provided a Latin poem, in which the King, after a day of hunting, was asked to contemplate the memorials of Scotland&#x27;s past, victories over the Romans and Vikings, the wars of Scottish Independence, and the present union of the kingdoms of Britain.

The palace was repaired in 1629. Roofing slates were shipped from Dundee to Newburgh. A glazier, David Masterton, painted the iron window grills or yetts with red lead. A new set of wooden armorial panels were made for the gatehouse and painted by Valentine Jenkin.

===Civil war===
Charles I, and Charles II also visited Falkland. Accounts survive for Charles II&#x27;s stay in July 1650, when proclamations had to be made to reduce the inflated prices of lodgings and horse-hire charged in the village. Charles&#x27; food was seasoned with saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Every tart provided for the king&#x27;s table had a pound of sugar, while tarts for lesser courtiers required only half a pound. The mining entrepreneur James Hope of Hopetoun visited on 18 July and met the king&#x27;s physician Dr Fraser, and various officials. In the privy chamber, Charles thanked him for a previous gift of a piece of Scottish gold, and later they talked about mining and technology.

A fire partially destroyed the palace during its subsequent occupation by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s troops, and it quickly fell into ruin.

===19th century===

In 1887 John, 3rd Marquis of Bute, purchased the estates of Falkland and started a 20-year restoration of the palace using two architects: John Kinross and Robert Weir Schultz. At the time the Palace was a ruin with no windows or doors. Thanks to his restoration work and considerable budget the Palace remains standing today. Many features in and around the Palace show evidence of his work, such as the &quot;B&quot; on the guttering and portraits of his children carved into a cupboard door in the Keeper&#x27;s Dressing Room.

During the time of Lord Bute, the ornamental kitchen garden was enhanced by a pergola and decorative vases. The north part of the &quot;upper garden&quot; was redesigned to express the foundations of Falkland Castle and Palace North Range which were uncovered during the Marquis&#x27;s archaeological excavations. Walls were built atop the foundations for the Well Tower and the Great Hall to emphasise the structures.

The Orchard and Palace gardens were linked to the House of Falkland by the private walk and new bridges. Houses were built near the palace and connected into the ornamental kitchen garden and orchard by a system of new public and private paths. The ground around the curling pond (to the North East of the orchard) was planted with trees and shrubs and laid out in flower plots.

The enclosing yew hedge around the pond garden is a typical feature of period. The lime tree avenue which is north of the palace gatehouse was built sometime between 1894 and 1912–13 according to the Ordinance Surveys of those periods. The Victorian glass house was built in 1890 by Mckenzie and Moncur from Edinburgh for Lord Bute and was used mainly to grow flowers and exotic plants. Plant hunting was popular at that time and wealthy people would travel the world to find specimens, and plant in their gardens for display to friends. There is also evidence that there was a second glass house in the garden near the existing one.

===Modern era ===

In 1952, the Hereditary Keeper Major Michael Crichton Stewart decided to appoint the National Trust for Scotland to take care of the Palace. The National Trust thus became Deputy Keeper of the Palace, and they now care for and maintain the Palace and its extensive gardens. The NTS website offers an array of articles and images exploring the Palace and grounds.

National Galleries Scotland have created a digital project exploring how the palace would look if reimagined in a warmer setting due to climate change.

===Gardens===
Falkland Palace stands on three hectares of ground on a sandstone ridge which is dominated by the Lomond Hills in the background. Those walking around the garden will see a distinct and overlapping timeline which reveals the ever-changing purpose and style of the grounds.

The first record of a garden here was in 1451. In 1500, a new gardener, John Strathachin or Strachen, was to be paid 4 merks yearly with grazing for his horse and cows. He was to provide fruit, onions and herbs. At that time the garden had a courtyard and stables in the gatehouse, where King James IV kept his great Belgian steed. There was also a fish pond which provided the King with fresh fish. Fruit, vegetables and herbs were grown in the area for the royal plate and meat could be hunted in the ancient forest (known as Falkland Forest) surrounding the Palace, by hawking and hunting wild boar and deer.

James VI met the English ambassadors Sir Robert Bowes and Sir William Bowes in the garden at 8 o&#x27;clock on 21 June 1597 and listened to their speeches about border affairs. In August 1602 James VI received the French ambassador, the Baron de Tour, in the garden. They talked for three quarters of an hour and the ambassador made the king laugh. A few days later they hunted together in the park.

Garden designer Percy Cane redesigned the gardens in the 1940s. He had designed the palace grounds at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Cane was born and educated in Essex where he studied horticulture and architecture. In 1930 Cane founded and edited the quarterly journal Garden Design and wrote many books on garden design. Cane&#x27;s style can best be described as Arts and Crafts and his curvy borders were seen as innovatory at the time.

Conservation in the garden is achieved through general maintenance, which includes clearing leaves, mowing the main lawn, tidying the flower beds and planting, enhancing and creating wildlife habitats. A wildflower meadow, native hedges and spring flowering bulbs have been planted to provide food and protection to various small insects and small mammals. Conservation means work has to be carried out in a sympathetic way throughout property, not only to the aesthetics and history of the palace but also for the climbing plants and bats that live in the cellars. Bats are endangered and protected in Scotland and it is important that they are not disturbed. The walls of the palace have been repointed (replacing the cement between the stones) and replaced with lime mortar which is a traditional material and better suited for this purpose as it is breathable and prevents dampening.

The current Head Gardener Sonia Ferrás Mañá is restoring the Percy Cane garden to the original design and flower choice. Mañá, the garden staff and volunteers have been working on various project in recent years to conserve the garden and encourage wildlife.

The garden team at Falkland Palace are now encouraging wildlife by bringing back the meadow. To create the meadow the grass has been cut only once a year for the last four years and more than 10,000 wild flowers and a similar number of spring flowering bulbs have been planted. This work is thanks to the garden staff, volunteers and support from Fife Environmental Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, NTS Member Centres and other donations. These flowers and un-mown grasses encourage beneficial insects to the orchard which aid in the fruit trees pollination and in turn attract other animals. There are currently forty different fly species in the orchard, some of which are rare or unusual and some are found nowhere else in Scotland. The insects, especially the moths, have attracted Pipistrelle and Soprano Pipistrelle bats which have been seen hunting and living here. There have also been sightings of red squirrels in the forest which are now considered endangered animals due to the disappearance of their habitat and the competition from grey squirrels. A Red Squirrel Project is carried out at Falkland Palace to encourage them back into the gardens. A shelter was built in the orchard for invertebrate (i.e. insects and worms) and small animals which will encourage them to stay longer in the garden and perhaps live there. The orchard has been planted with native trees such as hawthorn, oak and willows which would have been growing here in the 15th century. The Maspie Burn running between the garden and the orchard is a habitat for water wildlife, including trout.

==Building materials==
Some sandstone for the palace was quarried locally. Limestone for lime mortar was found and burnt on the Lomond Hills. In 1540, harder sandstone was quarried at Kingoodie near Dundee and shipped across the Tay to the haven of Lindores Abbey. Much of the timber, including imported &quot;Eastland boards&quot;, deals, and rafters supplied by a Danish merchant called &quot;Kinnereis&quot;, was bought at St Andrews and Dundee, where it was bound together into rafts called &quot;floats&quot; and towed to Newburgh or Lindores and Levenmouth. Other timber was bought at Leith at Kirkcaldy.

==Description==
The palace has two wings arranged in an &#x27;L&#x27; shape, now called the South and East Quarters or Ranges. The palace courtyard is entered through the gatehouse tower at the west end of the South Quarter. The external ashlar façade of the South Quarter has gunloops at basement level. Above these are the small windows of the private lodgings, and on the second level the large paired windows of the Chapel Royal. Between these windows are weathered niches and statues. The corbels show the instruments of the passion; the chapel at Falkland was dedicated to St Thomas and is the Catholic parish church for Falkland with Mass every Sunday at 9 a.m.

The wallhead is finished with a decorated cornice and battlement which continues around the west side of the gate tower. To the east of the chapel there is small rectangular sectioned tower which once housed a circular staircase, and beyond is the partly reconstructed gable of the East Quarter. Although some writers have attributed part of the South Quarter to the time of James IV, the form of the gunloops, the continuous parapet, and the documented payments to Peter the Flemishman for the 5 statues in 1539 adequately demonstrate that the present appearance dates from the works of James V. The entrance tower was built in 1541, and the accounts record the work of two master masons: &quot;to John Brownhill and Henry Bawtie for complete ending of the fore entry and tower ... and raising of certain chimneys in the south quarter.&quot; Within the gate tower and south quarter, visitors can view the Keeper&#x27;s Apartments in the tower, the Chapel Royal and gallery.

The East Quarter, apart from its courtyard façade is ruined. The centrally placed access tower, the Crosshouse, was reconstructed by the Marquis of Bute. The National Trust&#x27;s architect, Schomberg Scott recreated the King and Queen&#x27;s bedchambers within. The northern section of the East Quarter was originally a lodging built by James IV. The East Quarter was remodelled by the mason John Merlioun in 1538. This part of the building, with its &quot;back galleries&quot; overlooking the garden was decayed in 1615. In 1616 the master of works, James Murray was ordered to repair the flat roof of the King and Queen&#x27;s galleries and the roof of the lodging of the East Quarter in anticipation of the visit of James VI.
The South and East courtyard façades were decorated and unified with pilasters in a French Renaissance style between 1537 and 1542. Their appearance is comparable to the French Chateau of Villers-Cotterêts. The buttresses on the East are dated 1537, and on the South, where the masonry is more sophisticated, 1539. The later work may be connected with the arrival of Nicolas Roy, a French mason sent to Scotland in March 1539 by Antoinette of Bourbon, the mother of Mary of Guise.

The chapel ceiling dates from the time of James V, as recent dendrochronology work by the AOC Group has confirmed. It was constructed by the carpenter Richard Stewart, and was re-decorated for the visit of Charles I in 1633. James Murray, master of works, was ordered to repair the roof of the South Quarter in 1625, with instructions to &quot;have a special care and regard&quot; that the great ceiling of the Chapel be &quot;preserved and kept as far as possibly may be.&quot;

The tennis court, Cross House, and the east turnpike stair turret were plastered and harled for James V by John Kelly and John Malcolm &quot;alias&quot; Callum. Some of the interiors were plastered by a French specialist craftsman Hector Beato.

The courtyard was originally completed on the north with a great hall to the north. The footprint of the building was established by excavation and laid out with paving slabs by the 3rd Marquis of Bute. Beyond this area are the reconstructed footings of Falkland Castle. This was the site of the short-lived Nether Palace or Castlestead in the 17th century, known from a plan and elevation drawn by Alexander Edward.

==Real tennis court==

On the lower ground in the gardens, slightly beyond the remains of the medieval castle uncovered c. 1900, lies the original real tennis court. The masons William Mason and Alexander Allardice, and others built the tennis court. Its walls were finished by Callum the pargeoner, or lime plasterer. It is the world&#x27;s oldest tennis court still in use. The roofed spectator area is home to a number of swallows during spring and summer. The court is home to the Falkland Palace Royal Tennis Club.

Straffan is the name of the surrounding electoral division which is within the &quot;Celbridge Number 1 Rural Area&quot;, and which (as of 2006) had a population of 1,449. At one time a separate parish, it is today joined to the parishes of Celbridge (in the Roman Catholic structure) and &quot;Celbridge and Newcastle&quot; (Church of Ireland), in the respective Dublin dioceses.

Straffan is home to the &quot;Kildare Country Club&quot;, commonly known as the K Club, and its two championship golf courses, which have staged major international events such as the European Open (hosted annually there between 1995 and 2007), and the Ryder Cup tournament between Europe and the US in 2006.

==Contemporary village==

The contemporary village is concentrated around two crossroads on which are situated a Roman Catholic church and Church of Ireland respectively. Development evolved through the building of estate houses (1880), land commission cottages (1922–39), the Murray local council cottages (1949), and eight estates around the village. Housing developments also took place on the grounds of the K Club in the 2000–2004 period. As of 2007, a planning application had been lodged with Kildare County Council to develop a separate town to the south west at Turnings.

==Location==
Straffan is situated at a low lying point in the Liffey valley and is surrounded by flood meadows along the Liffey and River Morell. Agriculture is important to the local economy. Since the 18th century, Straffan farmers were prominent in the prize lists at events run by the Royal Dublin Society. The research station for the agriculture department of University College Dublin is situated at nearby Lyons Hill. As with the rest of County Kildare, racehorse breeding and training is common in the area. In the 1920s, Straffan Station stud was one of the leading horse breeding studs in the country when owned by Edward &quot;Cub&quot; Kennedy.

==Etymology==

The village is named for St. Srafán, whose feast day in the Martyrology of Tallaght was 23 May. Straffan was also one of 300 Irish locations accorded its own place-legend in Dinnshenchas Érenn (Metrical (ed. Edward Gwynn 1924) iv, pp 328–331). It consisted of a poem called &quot;Lumman Tige Srafain&quot;, about a warrior named Lumann who possessed a wonderful shield and who, according to the poem, died of his wounds at Tech Srafáin. Two forms of the name cited in the tale, &quot;Tech Srafáin&quot; and &quot;Tige Srafáin&quot;, are Middle Irish nominative and genitive case forms. The spelling Strafáin is unusual. &quot;Straphan&quot; or &quot;Straffan&quot; is a shortened Anglicised form of the original Irish &quot;Teach Srafáin&quot; (the initial Str- is the usual development of Irish Sr in English).

The second Irish name of the village is &quot;Cluainíní&quot;; this refers to the townland of Clownings, to the east of the village. This was formerly the site of Straffan railway station and the post office, and so it has been erroneously used as an Irish name for Straffan itself.

&quot;Dinnshenchas Érenn&quot;, probably composed by Cináed Ua Hartacáin (d. 975), also selected the nearby Cnoch Liamhna for mention as one of the &quot;assemblies and noted places in Ireland&quot;, an indication of the strength of the local ruling family, the Uí Dúnchada branch of the Uí Dúnlainge who supplied ten kings of Leinster from their base on nearby Lyons Hill between 750 and 1050.

&quot;Sruthán&quot; (stream) was mistakenly cited by Thomas O&#x27;Connor in the Ordnance Survey Letters in 1837, and adopted as the Irish form of Straffan. Seosamh Laoide used it in his list of Irish names of post-offices published in Post-Sheanchas (1905). &quot;An Sruthán&quot; gained currency among those involved in the Irish revival and was promoted as name in the local schools. Recent research by Domhnall mac Giolla Easpaig declares it &quot;completely at odds with the written evidence cited above and with local pronunciation and appears to be no more than an &quot;ad hoc&quot; explanation of the name by O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s informant.&quot; &quot;Sruthán&quot; is anglicised struffaun in some parts of the country. One would not expect to find it rendered thus in the Straffan area.&quot;

The village post office, opened , was closed in April 1924. A separate office was opened at Straffan Station in May 1872, this adjacent to the former station, 1.5 mi (2.5 km) from the village. On the adoption of Irish language names by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the 1920s, the name of Cluainíní was adopted for the station office, this being the Irish version of Clownings, the townland in which the post office and former station were situated. That office was closed at which date the office in the village was reopened and the Irish name of &quot;Teach Srafáin&quot; was adopted, this name appearing in the 1982 Post Office Guide.

==Places of interest==
Today Straffan contains Catholic and Church of Ireland churches, a newsagent, a butchers&#x27;, two pubs, the Straffan Inn and Friel&#x27;s, a gaelic football club, a soccer club and a primary school, Scoil Bhríde (present building constructed in 1963). The heritage of the area is reflected in the fact that fifty sites of archaeological and cultural interest in the locality have been identified and listed for preservation by Kildare County Council, ranging from an ancient hill fort and round tower to the 1913 Lych Gate to the graveyard which has been adopted as the symbol of the village. Local commercial visitor attractions include a Steam Museum at Lodge Park.

===Castles and houses===
The site of a tower house at Castledillon passed to the de Hereford and Rochford families (1359). No visible evidence of this tower house remains, with farm buildings now occupying the site. A Wogan family tower house &quot;in the north part of Richardstown townland&quot; described as &quot;a square building about in height&#x27; by Thomas O&#x27;Conor in 1837 is now reduced to a pile of stones and mortar which has obviously been moved from its original location.

Barberstown Castle () remains standing and remains in use as a hotel. It is at its greatest height with a battlemented keep, walls which are four and a half feet thick, two small towers, a 53 step staircase and some evidence of damage in the war of 1641. Originally built by Nicholas Barby in the 13th century, it passed through several owners before, in the 19th century, Hugh Barton added a new roof and built a Victorian house alongside. It has been used as a hotel since the 1970s.

Lyons Castle is mentioned in the 1332 Book of Howth when it was burned by the O&#x27;Tooles. It passed to the Tyrrell in the 13th century, the Aylmer family in 1271 and to the Lawless family, Barons Cloncurry in 1796 after which they built the nearby house. It was substantially rebuilt and refurbished by Valentine Lawless, the second Baron Cloncurry 1803–10.

Lodge Park () was designed by Nathaniel Clements for Hugh Henry. It is a Palladian house with four wings.

The townland known variously in the calendar Rolls as Surning, Twinings, Surnyng and eventually known as Turnings passed into the ownership of Thomas Hall (1406), William Preston (1508), Patrick Sarsfield (ancestor of Patrick Sarsfield of siege of Limerick fame) (1560), Theophilus Jones (1641) and eventually passed to the Mills family.

Straffan Lodge (), described by Samuel Lewis in 1837 as &quot;the neat residence of Mrs Whitelaw&quot;, is known for its dining room decorated Tudor style with oak panels. Its single storey wing was added later.

==Religion==
Local ecclesiastical sites prospered at different times. The medieval parish of Straffan lies on the border of the Diocese of Dublin (boundaries established in 1111), to the south of Taghadoe Parish (Teach Tua), bounded on the west by Mainham, south by Bodenstown and Whitechurch, and east by Killadoon and Castledillon. Ecclesiastical sources refer to Straphan Register of the Hospital of St. John the Baptist 1245, the Calendar of Justiciary Rolls 1306 and the Regal Visitation 1530 which describes Straffan as &quot;a church of the deanery of Saltu Salmonis&quot;. In 1541, Straffan was united with Castledillon, Donacumper and Kildrought.

The last Catholic parish priest of Castledillon died in 1707 after which the parish was joined with Straffan. Straffan parish is now joined to Celbridge.

Straffan&#x27;s ruined parish church (St. Patrick&#x27;s Church) in the graveyard at the centre of the village can be dated to the 15th century from its distinctive bell cote, and defensive living quarters over the main building in the manner of Oughter Ard and other local churches. Straffan Church of Ireland parish church (1833) has stained glass windows by Alfred Child and Catherine O&#x27;Brien and several monuments to the Barton family. It was modelled on churches in France. St. Brigid&#x27;s Catholic church (1787, rebuilt 1987) was also the site of the national school until 1963.

A well and stone roofed chapel at Ardrass (restored 1898) are associated with St Patrick. The hill was a place of pilgrimage until the 19th century.

Castledillon, on the south bank of the River Liffey opposite Straffan, is an ancient monastic site which was founded by Iollathan of the desert (feast day listed as 2 February in the Martyrology of Tallaght) and accorded a genealogy which indicated close kinship with the Uí Dúnlainge kings of Leinster. By 1294, the church of Tristeyldelane was described as &quot;not worth the services of chaplains&quot; in the Calendar of Christ Church deeds. The site is now identified by a pile of stones and one headstone, erected in 1758 to the Spellissy family. The Castledillon Friars Stone, probably erected for a 15th-century abbot of St Wolstan&#x27;s (four miles to the east), remained on the site until removed to the visitor centre in Kildare town.

==Transport==

===Straffan rail tragedy===

Straffan was the scene of a railway accident on 5 October 1853 in which 18 people died including four children. It occurred in heavy fog when a goods train ran into the back of a stalled passenger train at a point south of Straffan Station. The goods train smashed the first class carriage, which was driven a quarter of a mile through station. The tragedy was the subject of a poem by Donegal-born poet William Allingham. It was the third worst accident in rail history to that date.

Straffan railway station was last used for scheduled services in 1947 and the last special train stopped at Straffan in 1963. Straffan railway station opened on 1 August 1848 and finally closed on 10 November 1947.

===Straffan Steam Museum===

The Straffan Steam Museum is housed in a church which once stood in the Inchicore railway works in Dublin. The museum houses a collection of models of steam locomotives, a number of steam engines used for industrial propulsion, a pumping engine employed in Jameson&#x27;s distillery in Dublin, and a large beam engine installed in Smithwick&#x27;s brewery, Kilkenny, in 1847. The museum is open to visitors from on certain days during the summer.

==History==
The area was ravaged in the wars of 1641–2. The Lords of the Pale who allied with Rory O&#x27;More in 1642 included Nicholas Wogan of Rathcoffey (member of the Council of War), Andrew Aylmer of Donadea, Nicholas Sutton of Barberstown, John Gaydon of lrishtown (whose estate included the present Straffan), Garret Sutton of Richardstown and James Eustace of Clongowes. In 1641 Lyons Castle was taken and sacked on the orders of the new LJs William Parsons and John Borlase and two castles belonging to Edward Tipper of Tipperstown burned

When James Butler, 12th Earl of Ormond marched into Kildare in 1642, he burned Lyons, Newcastle and Oughterard on 1 February 1642.

General George Monck landed in Dublin in February 1642 for the parliamentarians and camped in Straffan (the horses field at Ardrass is named as his camp). Rathcoffey was besieged and taken by Monck in June 1642, 70 of the garrison made prisoners and later executed in Dublin. During the campaign Kildare county was burned &quot;for in length and 25 in breadth.&quot; William Petty&#x27;s Census of 1659 recorded &quot;Barbiestowne&quot; with 36 people and Straffan with 23 people, surnames among them included Byrne, Kelly, Doyle, Malone and Murphy.

According to depositions taken after the battle of Ovidstown, a party of 1798 Rebels met at Straffan Bridge including Patrick O&#x27;Connor &#x27;a lawyer from Straffan&#x27;, and spent some time in stables of Straffan Lodge (18 June). In 1803 Straffan men marched to Dublin to join Emmet&#x27;s rebellion, while Barney Daly&#x27;s pub in Baronrath was used as a rendez-vous.

Local landowner Valentine Lawless, later the second Baron Cloncurry, was sworn into United Irishmen by James O&#x27;Coigly. He was elected colonel of United Irishmen in Kildare, was the last proprietor of &#x27;The Press&#x27; (United Irish newspaper) and became the United Irish organiser in London until his arrest and detention in the Tower of London. He was also related to Robert Emmet and according to Emmet&#x27;s biographer Ruan O&#x27;Donnell provided a link between 1798 and 1803, waiting in Paris for word of success of the rebellion and was to be member of Emmet&#x27;s government. O&#x27;Donnell describes as &quot;disingenuous&quot; Lawless&#x27;s 1857 account of how he had pleaded with Emmet not to return to Dublin. The Sammon family form Straffan and the Pitts family from Bishopscourt were listed among the rebels.

On 22 January 1812, 100 persons assembled at night with carts for the purpose of retrieving hay which had been seized in lieu of rent. Leading to a confrontation during which Patrick King was shot dead. As a result of the incident, a request was made to have the military at Celbridge strengthened. Eventually in 1871 a neo-gothic RIC barracks was built in the village with distinctive gun turrets designed to repel invading Fenians. The barracks was vacated and passed into private hands in March 1905.

===War of Independence and the Troubles===
A National League branch for Celbridge and Straffan was established on 24 September 1887. Bertram H. Barton was a member of the Unionist Party and instigator of a sedition charge against the Principal of Ardclough School in 1917. Straffan casualties in the Great War included James Cash, (died 27 May 1918), D.A. Carden (4 September 1915), Thomas Goucher (22 January 1918), Ronald B.C. Kennedy (died of illness, 18 August 1917), G. Kinahan (14 October 1916), William Lawless (15 September 1917), and Peter McLeish, (21 January 1918). Francis Salmon was a civilian casualty in the Easter Rising of 1916.

A branch of the Irish National Volunteers was formed in Straffan in 1914. The St Anne&#x27;s Brass Band from Ardclough played at the Bodenstown commemoration in 1914 at which Thomas Clarke spoke. In February 1917 a Company was reformed in Straffan and a branch of Sinn Féin formed in 1918. Volunteers planned to bomb the bridge at Straffan but the plan was aborted. Telephone wires were destroyed at Bishopscourt and Straffan volunteers took part in the ambush at Stacumny on 5 July 1921. Prominent local volunteers included John Logie, Tom Cornelia, James Travers and John McSweeney. During the Civil war the barnewall homestead near the 13th Lock in Lyons was the North Kildare brigade headquarters for the anti-treaty IRA.

On 22 June 1975 a local man, Christopher Phelan, was stabbed to death when he delayed an attempt to derail a train passing on the main Dublin to Cork railway line by Loyalist paramilitaries near Baronrath bridge, who aimed to derail a train of republicans going to Bodenstown. His intervention saved the lives of 200 people on the train as it delayed the detonation of the bomb which blew a gap in the track.

On 31 March 1976 the biggest train robbery in Irish history took place at Wheatfield. Eight men in fluorescent jackets used emergency signals to stop the mail train bound from Cork to Dublin and escaped with £600,000 in small denomination notes. The incident became the centre of a celebrated miscarriage of justice case, known mistakenly as the Sallins Train Robbery case after the nearest rail station then open, when three men were wrongly convicted of the robbery.

===Straffan Estate and its owners===

In 1171, Trachstraphli was granted to Maurice Fitzgerald by Richard de Clare (Strongbow). In c1185 -1189 Gerald Fitzgerald was accorded &quot;Trachstraphli&quot; in the &quot;Red Book of the Earls of Kildare&quot; (G. MacNiocaill, ed., Dublin, 1964). In 1288 Sir John Fannyn conveyed Straffan and Ballespaddagh (Irishtown) to Richard Le Penkiston on a deed witnessed by Richard de la Salle, John Posswick and Nicholas Barby, each of whom gave their names to surrounding townlands, Sealstown (de la Salle), Possextown (Posswick) and Barberstown (Barby). In 1473 Suttons held the land as tenants and the land passed to John Gaydon (1490), Thomas Boules (1653), Richard Talbot (1679), John White (1691), Robert Delap (1717) and Dublin Banker Hugh Henry who purchased the house for £2,200 in 1731.

===Henry family===

Hugh Henry who was MP for Limavady 1713 and Antrim 1727–43 built a house which resembled Oakley Park in Celbridge. Another Hugh Henry (a nephew) built Lodge Park in 1775. His son Joseph Henry matriculated from Trinity College at 13, inherited the house in 1749, and became MP for Longford 1761–68, Joseph Henry is featured in many of the caricatures painted by William Hogarth and on display in the National Gallery of Ireland. His son John Joseph Henry gave the site for Straffan Catholic church in 1787. At the request of Valentine Lawless, Henry subscribed £500 for defence of Armagh rebel priest James O&#x27;Coigly. In 1801 he married Lady Emily Fitzgerald a daughter of the Duke of Leinster. According to a commentator of the time &quot;owing to his extravagance from one of the richest commoners in Ireland he became so embarrassed that he was obliged to sell Straffan and live abroad. Among other foolish things he built an underground passage from Straffan House to the stables.&quot; A Benjamin Hallam design for proposed extension to house from 1808 survives, but the house accidentally burned and the Henry family settled in France.

===Barton family===
Hugh Barton, of the wine firm Barton and Guestier, purchased the Straffan estate and built a new house, Straffan House (1828–32, designed by Frederick Darley), slightly downriver from the Henry&#x27;s burned out home. Twenty years later an attic and a distinctive mansard roof were added, and the stacks raised and embellished in the French style. An Italian style campanile tower with gilded vane was added later. The refurbished house was based on a chateau at Louveciennes.

Hugh Barton (1766–1854) was in turn succeeded by Nathaniel Barton (1799–1867), Hugh Lyndoch Barton (1824–1899), Bertram Francis Barton (1830–1904), Bertram Hugh Barton (1858–1927) and Capt Frederick (Derick) Barton (1900–1993). The first five generations of Bartons owned both the estate at Straffan and the family&#x27;s 37-hectare vineyard in St Julien near the Gironde north of Bordeaux, producers of Chateau Leoville-Barton and Chateau Langoa-Barton. On his death Bertram Barton left the Straffan estate to his eldest son Derrick and the Bordeaux estate to his second son Ronald Barton. Anthony Barton moved to St Julien in 1951 and took over the vineyard on the death of Ronald in 1986. The Barton dynasty is believed to be the longest period of single family ownership of any vineyard in Bordeaux.

==The K Club==

On the death of Bertram Barton in a hunting accident in 1927, the scale of the losses on the estate, £4,000 per year, became apparent. Derrick Barton laid off most of the staff and demolished part of the house before selling the house and estate for £15,000 to motorcycle manufacturer John Ellis in 1949. Derrick Barton moved to Straffan Glebe House for a time. Straffan House had five private owners in the mid-20th century: car importer Stephen O&#x27;Flaherty (1960), film producer Kevin McClory (1973), Iranian air force founder and minister in the Shah&#x27;s government Nadar Djhanbani (1977, shortly before the downfall of the Shah&#x27;s government and his execution), developer Patrick Gallagher (1979) and property magnate Alan Ferguson (1981).

Entrepreneur Michael Smurfit, who was searching for a suitable estate to develop as a country club, acquired Straffan House in 1988 (via the Jefferson Smurfit company). Purchased for £7m, a further £35m was spent developing the house as a hotel and golf course. In 1991, Straffan House was opened as a 31-bedroom hotel. In 1990, the north golf course, designed by Arnold Palmer, was completed. Straffan staged the PGA cup in 1991 and Irish professional Championship in 1992. As a result of a £1 million sponsorship offer from Smurfit Kappa, the European Open moved its annual home to Straffan in 1995. The European PGA was staged in the K Club in 2006. The south course was completed in 2003 and used for the 2004 European Open.

In 2002, Madison Dearborm took over Smurfit Kappa and divested itself of the K Club. Michael Smurfit purchased the hotel and estate and acquired a further on the opposite side of the river for €115m in 2004.

==Sport==
There is a history of horse breeding and training in the area. For example, The Tetrarch was foaled in the area in 1911 and the 1993 St. Leger Stakes winner, Bob&#x27;s Return, was bred at the Baronrath stud at Straffan.

Local sportsman Christopher Barton won an Olympic silver medal in 1948 as part of an all-Cambridge eight which represented Britain in the Olympic Games. His father Derrick Barton was a member of the British Modern Pentathlon team which finished seventh in the team event at the 1924 Olympics. Another Straffan resident, David Ritchie, laid out Ireland&#x27;s first golf course in the Curragh in 1852.

Straffan AFC, a local association football (soccer) club, was founded in 1978 and previously played in Whitechurch in Straffan. In 1979, the club reached the Counties Cup semi-final but were beaten. They decided to move to the Dublin section of the Leinster Junior League in 1981 and the club went on to win its first league title in 1981–1982.

Straffan GAA club was described in 1934 as the &quot;cradle of the GAA in Kildare Straffan&quot;. JL Carews played Sallins in their first match on the same day, 15 February 1885, that Maurice Davin&#x27;s first rules of Gaelic football were being agreed by the GAA Central Council in Cork. The club were successful in the 1966 Intermediate championship, and promoted to the Kildare senior championship from 1967 until 1979. In 2009, Straffan won the Junior football championship. Straffan now has two teams competing in the Kildare Senior division 2 and division 4 Football Leagues and at intermediate level in the championship.

The annual Liffey Descent canoe race, (first staged 1960) starts annually in Straffan and follows the River Liffey downstream to Islandbridge. 

In basketball, Anne Marie Cooney was a silver medallist at the 2011 Athens Special Olympics and gold medallist at the 2015 Los Angeles Special Olympics.

<text>John Burke (March 9, 1832 – January 4, 1871) was a Confederate Adjutant General of Texas and spy. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 9, 1832. He was left an orphan by age 11 and eventually he made his way to Marshall, Texas. There he studied law at night and was a cobbler (shoemaker) by day. He was eventually admitted to the bar and took rank as a criminal lawyer alongside his brother-in-law, Pendleton Murrah. When the Civil War broke out, he joined the Confederacy and was briefly a member of the famous Hood&#x27;s Brigade until he became a scout. He served early in the war as a scout for P. G. T. Beauregard, Joseph E. Johnston, and J. E. B. Stuart during Jackson&#x27;s Valley Campaign in 1862. He rode with J. E. B. Stuart around George B. McClellan&#x27;s army in 1862. Burke traveled behind Union lines as far as New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.. He used disguises, frequently the uniform of a Union officer, and would change the color of his artificial eye. He was able to provide Robert E. Lee with valuable information about Union forces and dispositions. Unfortunately, Captain John Burke never really kept a record of any field reconnaissance, but the information he gathered for the Confederacy was &quot;said to have aided Beauregard and Johnston at Manassas.&quot; His most daring adventure came after he was apprehended in Philadelphia. He was placed under guard, in irons and handcuffs. As the train to Washington crossed a high trestle, he jumped into a river and made his way back to Lee. Fatigued by his exertions and now a colonel, Burke resigned and accepted appointment by Governor Pendleton Murrah as adjutant general of Texas, effective November 1, 1864. General Lee wrote a letter thanking him for his services. Records of the adjutant general&#x27;s office were lost in the Texas State Capitol fire of 1881, and little of Burke&#x27;s service in that assignment is known.

At the end of the war he joined Murrah in his flight to Mexico. After Murrah died on August 4, 1865, Burke returned to Marshall and resumed his law practice. After the war, Burke married Jennie Taylor in 1865. They had two sons and a daughter, all of whom were born at John and Jennie Taylor Burke&#x27;s plantation, Taylor Hall. Col. Burke emptied his plantation house of all finery as he had to burn it down. During reconstruction, the Yankees seized the plantations of high-ranking officers. Burke knew that being lynched for taking this step was the penalty according to the martial law. No one dared to reproach this dedicated man.
His most famous case at the bar was his defense of prisoners held at Jefferson, Texas in the Stockade Case in 1869. Burke died at Jefferson on January 4, 1871, and is buried there.

== Disguises and Spy Life ==
John Burke was both a scout and a spy. Those are completely different jobs, yet still similar, especially if one spy is doing them both. Scouting means to hear information, so a scout is one who would hear and find out important information about the enemy and their plans and problems. The way a scout does this is that they are supposed to learn, from others, the movements, strengths, and force of the enemy. To spy means to see. A spy is supposed to be observative and watch everything. A spy is supposed to learn by seeing. A spy like Burke enters the lines of the enemy in disguise in order to spy out the land. General Thomas L. Rosser says that John Burke &quot;was the eyes and ears of Lee&#x27;s army.&quot; If a spy like John Burke is seen in battle, he is to be seen as &#x27;a regular prisoner of war.&#x27; Spies are often secretive by creating clever disguises in order to gather important information. During his expeditions as a scout and a spy, Burke many times went into the enemy&#x27;s country in various clever disguises. Some of these disguises were being a truck farmer and pretending to be a gentleman of leisure lounging around the Capitol at Washington. John Burke also had an artificial eye. He would take out and change the color of this glass eye as a very different disguise. Lastly, because he was born in the Northern region of the United States, Burke &quot;possessed a Northern accent that enabled him to move about among the Yankees without rousing suspicion;&quot; thus, making him a key element in the Confederate spy ring.
As a scout and spy, John Burke invaded the departments and gathered a lot of valuable information from enemies. Importantly for his career, Burke excelled as a mimic. From the most reliable people and sources, he was able to pick up important army news. Although, sometimes John Burke was not careful enough and the enemy was almost too quick for him, but every time, he outsmarted the enemy. On one expedition, John Burke was caught in Philadelphia. He was ironed and handcuffed, and death by hanging seemed to be next. But, while being taken away in a train at night, Burke remembered jumping off of bridges. Because of this memory, he jumped overboard the train and he escaped and was back at Lee&#x27;s headquarters in only a few days. Back in battle, Burke was discovered again. He decided to abandon and run away from his horse and go into hiding nearby. He found an empty barn. This barn was just too empty. It had no place for Burke to hide. He decided to climb up onto the cross beams overhead, and he hid breathlessly while he watched as his pursuers entered the barn and looked almost everywhere possible that the clever spy, John Burke, could be. Finally, they gave up and left. There are many more escape stories from John Burke&#x27;s spy and scout career, but there is one particularly amusing one. With the enemy close at his heels, Burke ran into a friend&#x27;s house nearby. The only possibly sufficient hiding place was the wide-spreading hoopskirt of his hostess. This very personal hiding spot proved sufficient.

<doc id="1141965" wikidata="Q1172789" url="?curid=1141965" title="Daubert standard">
<text>In United States federal law, the Daubert&quot; standardis a rule of evidence regarding the admissibility of [[expert witness]] [[testimony]]. A party may raise a Daubert&quot; motion, a special motion &quot;in limine&quot; raised before or during trial, to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury. The &quot;Daubert&quot; trilogy are the three United States Supreme Court cases that articulated the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard:

*&quot;Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&quot; (1993), which held that Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence did not incorporate the &quot;Frye&quot; standard as a basis for assessing the admissibility of scientific expert testimony, but that the rule incorporated a flexible reliability standard instead;
*&quot;General Electric Co. v. Joiner&quot; (1997), which held that a district court judge may exclude expert testimony when there are gaps between the evidence relied on by an expert and that person&#x27;s conclusion, and that an abuse-of-discretion standard of review is the proper standard for appellate courts to use in reviewing a trial court&#x27;s decision of whether it should admit expert testimony;
*&quot;Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael&quot; (1999), which held that the judge&#x27;s gatekeeping function identified in &quot;Daubert&quot; applies to all expert testimony, including that which is non-scientific.

Important appellate-level opinions that clarify the standard include Judge Alex Kozinski&#x27;s opinion in Daubert on remand (&quot;Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&quot;, 43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir. 1995)), and Judge Edward Becker&#x27;s opinion in &quot;In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig.&quot;, 35 F.3d 717 (3d Cir. 1994).

In &quot;Daubert&quot;, seven members of the court agreed on the following guidelines for admitting scientific expert testimony:
*Judge is gatekeeper: Under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the task of &quot;gatekeeping&quot;, or assuring that scientific expert testimony truly proceeds from &quot;scientific knowledge&quot;, rests on the trial judge.
*Relevance and reliability: This requires the trial judge to ensure that the expert&#x27;s testimony is &quot;relevant to the task at hand&quot; and that it rests &quot;on a reliable foundation&quot;. &quot;Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.&quot;, 509 U.S. 579, 584-587. Concerns about expert testimony cannot be simply referred to the jury as a question of weight. Furthermore, the admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Rule 104(a), not Rule 104(b); thus, the judge must find it more likely than not that the expert&#x27;s methods are reliable and reliably applied to the facts at hand.
*Scientific knowledge = scientific method/methodology: A conclusion will qualify as &quot;scientific knowledge&quot; if the proponent can demonstrate that it is the product of sound &quot;scientific methodology&quot; derived from the &quot;scientific method&quot;.
*Illustrative factors: The court defined &quot;scientific methodology&quot; as the process of formulating hypotheses and then conducting experiments to prove or falsify the hypothesis, and provided a set of illustrative factors (i.e., not a &quot;test&quot;) in determining whether these criteria are met:

# Whether the theory or technique employed by the expert is generally accepted in the scientific community;
# Whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication;
# Whether it can be and has been tested;
# Whether it has a known error rate; and
# Whether the research was conducted independent of the particular litigation or dependent on an intention to provide the proposed testimony.

In 2000, the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 702 was amended in an attempt to codify and structure elements embodied in the &quot;&quot;Daubert&quot; trilogy.&quot;

==Use==
Although the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard is now the law in federal court and over half of the states, the &quot;Frye&quot; standard remains the law in some jurisdictions including California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Washington. Florida passed a bill to adopt the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard as the law governing expert witness testimony, which took effect on July 1, 2013. On May 23, 2019, the Florida Supreme Court accepted the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard. On August 28, 2020, The Maryland Court of Appeals adopted the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard.

Although trial judges have always had the authority to exclude inappropriate testimony, prior to &quot;Daubert&quot;, trial courts often preferred to let juries hear evidence proffered by both sides. Once certain evidence has been excluded by a &quot;Daubert&quot; motion because it fails to meet the relevancy and reliability standard, it will likely be challenged when introduced again in another trial. Even though a &quot;Daubert&quot; motion is not binding to other courts of law, if something was found untrustworthy by one court, other judges may choose to follow that precedent. Of course, a decision by an appellate court that a piece of evidence is inadmissible under &quot;Daubert&quot; would be binding on district courts within that court&#x27;s jurisdiction. An evidentiary hearing on the motion may not be necessary if the court finds that it would not assist the court in ruling on any of the matters in the motion.

===Timing===
To attack expert testimony as inadmissible, counsel may bring pretrial motions, including motions &quot;in limine&quot;. The motion &quot;in limine&quot; may be brought prior to trial, although counsel may bring the motion during trial as well. A motion attacking expert testimony should be brought within a reasonable time after the close of discovery if the grounds for the objection can be reasonably anticipated. The hearing should be made well in advance of the first time a case appears on a trial calendar. 

In one case where a Daubert hearing was conducted on the day of the trial, in which the district court excluded all plaintiff&#x27;s expert testimony, resulting in the dismissal of all claims, the appellate court remanded the case because of multiple irregularities and a defective record of lower court proceedings. The appellate court noted that in cases that rely heavily on expert testimony, a district court should set a discovery and trial schedule that realistically provides both sides with an adequate opportunity to introduce necessary evidence. The application of Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to proposed expert testimony can often be an uncertain process and is best conducted in such a manner that litigants have a reasonable opportunity to locate experts who meet the rule&#x27;s requirements.

In another case in which the defendant was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude expert testimony one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own &quot;voir dire&quot; of the expert in question before he testified. The district court preliminarily found that defendant&#x27;s motion was predicated on a ruling made almost three months earlier by a district court in another state, and that defendant had shown no good cause for waiting to file the motion. The defendant ultimately lost that case, following the admission of the disputed expert testimony, and ultimately failed in its appeal.

==History==
Prior to &quot;Daubert&quot;, relevancy in combination with the &quot;Frye&quot; standard were the dominant standards for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence in Federal courts. &quot;Frye&quot; is based on a 1923 Federal Court of appeals ruling involving the admissibility of polygraph evidence. Under &quot;Frye&quot;, the court based the admissibility of testimony regarding novel scientific evidence on whether it has &quot;gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.&quot; The trial court&#x27;s gatekeeper role in this respect is typically described as conservative, thus helping to keep pseudoscience out of the courtroom by deferring to those in the field.

In &quot;Daubert&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that the 1923 &quot;Frye&quot; standard was superseded by the 1975 Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 702 governing expert testimony. Rule 702 originally stated (in its entirety),
If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.

In &quot;Daubert&quot;, the court ruled that nothing in the Federal Rules of Evidence governing expert evidence &quot;gives any indication that &#x27;general acceptance&#x27; is a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence. Moreover, such a rigid standard would be at odds with the Rules&#x27; liberal thrust and their general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to &#x27;opinion&#x27; testimony.&quot; By requiring experts to provide relevant opinions grounded in reliable methodology, proponents of &quot;Daubert&quot; were satisfied that these standards would result in a fair and rational resolution of the scientific and technological issues which lie at the heart of product liability adjudication. Daubert has not appeared to further the Federal Rules philosophy of admitting generally all relevant testimony, and specifically of relaxing the traditional barriers to &#x27;opinion&#x27; testimony.&quot; The &quot;Daubert&quot; decision has instead been heralded by some political commentators as one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in imposing higher barriers for toxic tort and product liability cases, by allegedly reducing the volume of so-called junk science in the court room.

According to a 2002 RAND study, post Daubert, the percentage of expert testimony by scientists that was excluded from the courtroom significantly rose. This rise likely contributed to a doubling in successful motions for summary judgment in which 90% were against plaintiffs. Beyond this study, there is little empirical evidence of the impact of &quot;Daubert&quot;. However, some critics argue that &quot;Daubert&quot; has disrupted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants, &quot;The exclusion of expert testimony affects plaintiffs far more than defendants because plaintiffs may then not be able to meet their required burden of proof. Furthermore, there is little point in plaintiffs going to the expense of &quot;Daubert&quot; motions to exclude defendant&#x27;s experts until they know if their case will proceed. So if more experts are now being excluded, then &quot;Daubert&quot; has undoubtedly shifted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants and made it more difficult for plaintiffs to litigate successfully.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Daubert&quot; hearings can be subject to various abuses by attorneys attempting to bolster a weak case. These tactics can range from simply attempting to delay the case to driving up the costs of the litigation forcing settlement.

A different pattern has emerged in criminal cases. In criminal cases, the prosecution has the burden of proof and uses a host of forensic science methods as evidence to prove their case; but &quot;Daubert&quot; motions are rarely made by criminal defendants and when they do, they lose a majority of the challenges. Some critics of the use of unreliable science in court argue that &quot;Daubert&quot; has had beneficial effects in civil litigation, but fails to address the underlying pathologies of the forensic science system that leads to dubious verdicts in criminal cases.

Some commentators believe that &quot;Daubert&quot; caused judges to become—in the phrase used in Chief Justice William Rehnquist&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Daubert&quot;—amateur scientists, many lacking the scientific literacy to effectively fulfill their role as gatekeeper of scientific evidence. Although &quot;science for judges&quot; forums have emerged in the wake of &quot;Daubert&quot; in order to educate judges in a variety of scientific fields, many are still skeptical about the usefulness of the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard in discerning valid science. The responsibility to assess scientific relevance has shifted from highly trained expert witnesses to judges deficient in science education. The &quot;Daubert&quot; ruling furthermore admits the possible introduction of non-peer reviewed data and conclusions. This increasingly shifts the burden of scientific judgement onto judges who have not had an education which would enable them to properly evaluate such data.

Pursuant to Rule 104(a), in &quot;Daubert&quot; the U.S. Supreme Court suggested that the following factors be considered:
# Has the technique been tested in actual field conditions (and not just in a laboratory)?
# Has the technique been subject to peer review and publication?
# What is the known or potential rate of error?
# Do standards exist for the control of the technique&#x27;s operation?
# Has the technique been generally accepted within the relevant scientific community?

The Supreme Court explicitly cautioned that the &quot;Daubert&quot; list should not be regarded by judges as &quot;a definitive checklist or test...&quot; Yet in practice, judges have judged the admissibility of scientific evidence using the &quot;&quot;Daubert&quot; factors&quot; as a checklist; for example, the trial court judge in &quot;Kumho&quot; admitted to erroneously treating the factors as mandatory.

===Pronunciation of &quot;Daubert&quot;===

Daubert has been pronounced (), () and (). Yale Law School&#x27;s &quot;Pronouncing Dictionary of the Supreme Court of the United States&quot; gives (audio) and quotes Jason Daubert himself. On the other hand, Daubert&#x27;s lawyer, Michael H. Gottesman, while noting &quot;the family&#x27;s name is not dough-bear&quot;, reports that &quot;the folks who brought this case to the Supreme Court pronounce their name &#x27;Dow-burt&#x27;.&quot;

==International influence==
The Canadian Supreme Court expressly discussed the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard in &quot;R. v. J.-L.J.&quot;, [2000]. In J.-L.J., the court took a look at the development of U.S. law in this regard, noting the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s rejection of the &quot;Frye&quot; standard and its replacement with the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard. While the court did note that: &quot;&quot;Daubert&quot; must be read in light of the specific text of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which differs from our own procedures,&quot; the court also stated in the same sentence that &quot;the U.S. Supreme Court did list a number of factors that could be helpful in evaluating the soundness of novel science.&quot; The court then incorporated elements from the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard in their decision regarding the Quebec Court of Appeal ruling while ultimately rejecting the lower court&#x27;s decision and reinstating the defendant&#x27;s conviction.

Later, in 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co.&quot; [2015] 2 SCR 182 endorsed the parts of &quot;R v. J.-L.J.&quot; that cited &quot;Daubert&quot;, saying: &quot;in the case of an opinion based on novel or contested science or science used for a novel purpose, the reliability of the underlying science for that purpose: &quot;J. (J.-L.)&quot;, at paras. 33, 35-36 and 47&quot;. This suggests that reliability using the &quot;Daubert&quot; factors should be assessed when novel or contested science is adduced.

Additionally, in 2005, the United Kingdom House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee recommended the creation of a Forensic Science Advisory Council to regulate forensic evidence in the UK and observed that: The absence of an agreed protocol for the validation of scientific techniques prior to their being admitted in court is entirely unsatisfactory. Judges are not well-placed to determine scientific validity without input from scientists. We recommend that one of the first tasks of the Forensic Science Advisory Council be to develop a &quot;gate-keeping&quot; test for expert evidence. This should be done in partnership with judges, scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system, and should build on the US &quot;Daubert&quot; test.

The Law Commission for England and Wales proposed a consultation paper (No.190) to adopt a criterion like the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard to help reform the law of evidence in regards to the admissibility of scientific evidence.

<doc id="1141966" wikidata="Q7276108" url="?curid=1141966" title="RCMP Academy, Depot Division">
<text>RCMP Academy, Depot Division (commonly known as &quot;Depot&quot;, not ) is the police training academy for Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) cadets. Providing training since its establishment in 1885, the facility is located in the west part of Regina, Saskatchewan, near the airport, and consists of several buildings.

==History==

In the RCMP&#x27;s early days, Depot had a full horse stable and employed veterinarians. Horsemanship is no longer part of the cadets&#x27; training since 1966.

Depot is the only location where the RCMP trains its cadets. One of the only rare exceptions was some Mounties were trained at an Ottawa region facility in the 1950s or 1960s. This training centre, now closed, was located by the present Ottawa RCMP stables, where the horses of the RCMP Musical Ride are kept off-season. The buildings of the former Ottawa training centre have become the Canadian Police College, a Canadian government institution which offers continuing-education courses for currently employed police officers. A small number of members had part of their training at CFB Penhold in Alberta as well in the early 70s. At that time, due to extensive hiring and construction at the academy, Depot could not handle the overwhelming number of candidates. Therefore, the RCMP established the additional and temporary training facility in CFB Penhold, near Red Deer, AB.

In addition to training new RCMP regular members, Depot has also been a major continuing-education centre for police in Canada, but is currently tasked primarily with the training of new members and other training is conducted elsewhere. It delivers updated and highly specialized training to experienced RCMP officers and to members of other forces from around the world who want to improve their knowledge.

Many Canadian municipal and provincial police forces hire police officers who graduated from the RCMP Academy. No one can join the RCMP as a regular member without completing the RCMP Academy&#x27;s 26-week Cadet Training Program. Candidates who are graduates of a police training institution and have served a minimum of two years in a policing role with another Canadian police agency can undergo a five-week learning and orientation program rather than the full 26-week program.

The RCMP Academy has altered its curriculum due to the social and economic changes of Canadian society; the school now focuses more on knowledge relating to the multiple facets of law enforcement than on military discipline. In the early 1990s, the six-month thorough military-style RCMP training was slightly modified to face the new make-up of trainees. Cadets are now 10 years older than their 1950s or 1960s counterparts; and decade after decade, the ratio of college and university-educated future Mounties keeps increasing. The higher maturity level of trainees requires fewer disciplinary actions and enables the instructors to focus on the very demanding requirements of modern police work.

As of February 5, 2020, cadets at the RCMP Academy receive a weekly allowance of $525 to a maximum of $13,650 for the entire 26-week Cadet Training Program.

After the recruitment process, successful candidates are scheduled to attend the Academy and begin the Cadet Training Program. Cadets are grouped together in what the force calls &quot;troops&quot;. A troop consists of a maximum of 32 men and women who follow their entire 26-week training together. The number of trainees at Depot varies in relation to the demands of the force.

==Buildings at Depot==

Buildings at Depot include the following:

* Applied Police Sciences Building Building — contains classrooms, 100-seat theatre, specialized computer classrooms and various syndicate rooms.
* Armourer&#x27;s Shop
* Centennial Building
* Centralized Training Facility — offers serving members and outside agencies both modern classrooms and accommodations.

* Model Detachment and Town Site
* Old Gym
* Police Driving Unit — spread around Depot, it includes a large modern vehicle fleet as well as six 4x4 vehicles. There are a number of tracks that simulate various driving conditions.
* RCMP Heritage Centre

===Armourer&#x27;s Shop===
This building provides for the inspection and preparation of new firearms for issue; complete repair, reconditioning and maintenance of firearms; training on firearms maintenance and repair, quality assurance of ammunition; consultation services in the field of small arms and ammunition; testing of bullet-proof vests and material and warranty services for many firearms manufacturers.

===Chapel===

The oldest remaining building in Regina is the RCMP chapel, dating from the earliest establishment of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) as a guardhouse in 1883. It subsequently served as a mess hall and canteen and became a chapel in 1895. It was constructed in Ontario and moved by flatcar, steamer and ox team to Regina.

The chapel was built by Mr. John Ross, a local building contractor. Originally a mess hall it was partially destroyed by fire in the spring of 1895. After its restoration it was converted to a chapel.

The wife of the police commissioner, Mrs. Herchmer, wanted a chapel for the force members, who were located west of town. NWMP carpenters converted the mess hall to a chapel, making the altar and pews themselves. The chapel was dedicated on December 8, 1895.

The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at the RCMP Museum Chapel. On each side of the altar is a stained glass memorial window, each portrays a member of the force. On the left is a constable in mourning; on the right is a bugler sounding reveille. The model for the windows was Constable John Roy Fraser of Westville, Nova Scotia, in 1943. Fraser retired in 1960 at the rank of staff sergeant. The Memorial Project came about following the shooting of Constable Willis Edward Rhodeniser on the White Bear Reserve near Carlyle, Saskatchewan, on August 26, 1939. Two more stained glass memorial windows on each side wall near the front were dedicated on November 4, 1951. &quot;The Resurrection&quot; in the west window honours serving members and &quot;The Nativity&quot; in the east window honours ex-members of the force who died in the Second World War.

The chapel is one of the oldest Anglican houses of worship in western Canada, but today has only two monthly religious services. There is an Ecumenical (Protestant) service on the second Sunday of each month and a Roman Catholic service on the fourth Sunday of each month at 10 am.

===Centennial Building===
Formerly the RCMP Centennial Museum. Established in 1933, the RCMP Museum operated in a number of facilities for its first sixty years. The museum was officially opened on its present site in 1973 by Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, in honour of the RCMP&#x27;s centennial. The museum contained many artifacts relating to the colourful history and traditions of the RCMP. The museum permanently closed in October 2006 and the collection moved to the RCMP Heritage Centre. The building now houses an auditorium, simulator training classroom and mess hall.

===Gym===
The gym, commonly referred to as the &quot;Old Gym&quot;, is equipped with a self-defence gymnasium and a 26-metre swimming pool.

Commonly referred to as the &quot;New Gym&quot;, the Fitness Centre includes a large gymnasium and a state-of-the-art cardio and weight training facility complete with treadmills, steppers, stationary bikes, free weights and various types of weight training equipment. This facility was expanded in 2007.

=== Model Detachment and Town Site ===
Opened in 1994, the Buffalo Detachment, is a replica of a modern working RCMP Detachment, complete with everything you would find in such a facility. It provides the main hub of training at the Academy. A second detachment, known as &quot;Eagle detachment&quot; has since been implemented to accommodate larger troop loads.

Surrounding the Model Detachment, the Town Site provides for a more realistic and safe environment during practical simulation scenarios.

===RCMP Heritage Centre===
Opened in May 2007, the RCMP Heritage Centre is a non-profit, volunteer governed, charitable organization incorporated under the Non-Profit Corporations Act of Saskatchewan.

<text>Barringer is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the Far side of the Moon, named after geologist Daniel Barringer. It is attached to the north-northeastern rim of the walled basin named Apollo, and lies to the southeast of Plummer. South of Barringer, on the floor of the Apollo basin, is the crater Scobee.

This crater is generally circular in form, with a slight outward bulge along the western rim. The outer of ejecta spills over slightly into the Apollo basin floor, but the remainder of the rim lies in rugged irregular ground. At the midpoint is a central peak formation with a pair of tiny craters to either side: east and southwest. The remaining floor is relatively flat to the north and somewhat more irregular to the south.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Barringer.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Barringer L — &quot;See&quot; Scobee (crater).
* Barringer M — &quot;See&quot; Smith (lunar crater).

<doc id="1141971" wikidata="Q7579299" url="?curid=1141971" title="Sport Aid">
<text>Sport Aid (also known as Sports Aid) was a sport-themed campaign for African famine relief held in May 1986, involving several days of all-star exhibition events in various sports, and culminating in the Race Against Time, a 10 km fun run held simultaneously in 89 countries. Timed to coincide with a UNICEF development conference in New York City, Sport Aid raised $37 million for Live Aid and UNICEF. A second, lower-key Sport Aid was held in 1988.

==Organisation==
The event was organised by chairman and founder Chris Long, Bob Geldof (Band Aid and Live Aid) and John Anderson (Head of Global Special Events, UNICEF). 

A central event was the lighting of a symbolic torch at the United Nations by Omar Khalifa, a champion Sudanese 1500m runner, to signal the start of the 10K races around the world. Khalifa began his journey to the UN on May 16, when he lit a torch from the embers of a fire in El Moweilih relief camp in the Sudan. He was then flown to Athens, where the torch of Africa and the Olympic torch were symbolically joined. This marked the first time the Olympic torch had been lit outside of an Olympic Games. Khalifa then ran through 12 European capitals, and was greeted by leaders such as Margaret Thatcher, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, François Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl and Pope John Paul II.

The events in the United States were not widely publicized, due in part to the Hands Across America fundraiser, to fight hunger and homelessness, occurring around the same time. Sport Aid was scheduled to take place on the eve of a UN special session on Africa; therefore, the conflict could not be avoided.
==1986==
===Race Against Time===
At 15:00 UTC on Sunday, May 25, 1986, runners around the world ran, jogged or walked 10 kilometers, having collected sponsorships or donations to support African famine relief charities.

274 cities held official events, allowing over 19.8 million participants to follow designated courses, with television coverage worldwide. London saw 200,000 runners complete the course, Barcelona hosted 50,000, Athens 30,000, Santiago 15,000, Dublin 20,000, Port of Spain 15,000, and Melbourne 10,000. These runners and millions of others set out at the same time to run around their villages or local parks, or simply to take part in this global event. In the United States, New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco participated, along with several running clubs in smaller towns, with New York hosting the flagship race. 

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;With 200,000 Londoners setting the pace, more than 20 million runners in 76 countries ran today in Sport Aid, a global benefit to raise money for the starving of Africa. Sport Aid is considered the biggest mass sport event ever organized.

===Other events===
Other events included the Ultimate Cricket Match between the West Indies and the Rest of the World, and a figure skating exhibition featuring Torvill and Dean.

A charity record was released to publicize and raise money for the event. Tears for Fears re-recorded their hit &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; as &quot;Everybody Wants to Run the World&quot;.

==1988==
===Running All Over the World===
In support of the 1988 Sport Aid event, the band Status Quo released the charity single &quot;Running All Over the World&quot;, an adaptation of the band&#x27;s well-known cover of &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;. 

Concerts, known under the title First World Carnival, were held in London, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Harare, Kuala Lumpur and Brisbane. The charity run and the concert were broadcast in a two-hour programme and was expected to be viewed by 750 million viewers in 124 countries.

===Race Against Time===
==== Race ====
On Sunday, September 11 1988, runners around the world in 300 cities ran, jogged, or walked 5 kilometers, having collected sponsorships or donations to CARE to support African famine relief charities. The race began at 2:30 pm UTC. Celebrities like Madonna, Sting, Eurythmics, and Steve Winwood took part in the race as well. 

==== Video game / aftermath ====
Also released was the video game tie-in &quot;The Race Against Time&quot;. The game is considered to have been a commercial failure; Sport Aid had predicted it would raise £1 million for the charity; it instead sold 25,000 copies. Following the game&#x27;s failure, it was revealed in December 1988 that Sport Aid Limited had £2 million in debt.

<doc id="1141972" wikidata="Q7695688" url="?curid=1141972" title="Iconectiv">
<text>iconectiv supplies communications providers with network planning and management services. The company’s cloud-based information as a service network and operations management and numbering solutions span trusted communications, digital identity management and fraud prevention. Known as Bellcore after its establishment in the United States in 1983 as part of the break-up of the Bell System, the company&#x27;s name changed to Telcordia Technologies after a change of ownership in 1996. The business was acquired by Ericsson in 2012, then restructured and rebranded as iconectiv in 2013.

A major architect of the United States telecommunications system, the company pioneered many services, including caller ID, call waiting, mobile number portability, and toll-free telephone (800) service. It also pioneered the prepaid charging system and the Intelligent Network.

Headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey (U.S.), iconectiv provides network and operations management, numbering, registry and fraud prevention services for the global telecommunications industry. It provides numbering services in more than a dozen countries, including serving as the Local Number Portability Administrator (LNPA) for the United States. In that capacity, iconectiv manages the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC), the system that supports the implementation of local number portability.

==Founding==
iconectiv was established on October 20, 1983, as Central Services Organization as part of the 1982 Modification of Final Judgment that broke up the Bell System. It later received the name Bell Communications Research. Nicknamed Bellcore, it was a consortium established by the Regional Holding Companies upon their separation from AT&amp;T. Since AT&amp;T retained Bell Laboratories, the operating companies desired a separate research and development facility. Bellcore, the tenth company to register an Internet domain name in comTLD, provided joint research and development, was involved in standards setting, training, and centralized government point-of-contact functions for its co-owners, the seven Regional Holding Companies that were themselves divested from AT&amp;T as holding companies for the 22 local Bell Operating Companies.

Bellcore&#x27;s initial staff and corporate culture were drawn from the nearby Bell Laboratories locations in northern New Jersey, plus additional staff from AT&amp;T and regional operating companies. The company originally had its headquarters in Livingston with dedication by New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean in 1985, but moved its headquarters to Morristown a decade later. Bellcore also operated the former Bell System Center for Technical Education in Lisle, Illinois.

==Separation from the Baby Bells==
In 1996, the company was provisionally acquired by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The sale was closed one year later, following a regulatory approval process that covered every U.S. state individually. Since the divested company no longer had any ownership connection with the Regional Bell Operating Companies (&quot;Baby Bells&quot;), the name was changed to Telcordia Technologies in 1999. The headquarters was moved to Piscataway, New Jersey.

The former headquarters campus in Morristown and its offices and laboratories in Red Bank, New Jersey, are former Bell Labs locations that were transferred to Telcordia.

Equal stakes in the company were sold in March 2005 to Providence Equity Partners and Warburg Pincus.

==Acquisition by Ericsson==
On June 14, 2011, Ericsson announced an agreement to acquire Telcordia for $1.15 billion. On January 12, 2012, Telcordia became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ericsson. On June 15, 2011, Ericsson announced the completion of the purchase from private-equity firms Providence Equity Partners and Warburg Pincus, with the goal to pursue industry trends that include mobile broadband, managed services/outsourcing and global OSS/BSS transformation. The acquisition, which officially closed on January 12, 2012, added about 2,600 employees to Ericsson&#x27;s staff. On June 4, 2012, Telcordia and its products were officially rebranded as Ericsson.

In the process of integration, Telcordia&#x27;s Advanced Technology Solutions business unit, the company&#x27;s research arm, was rebranded as Applied Communication Sciences, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ericsson that operated independently on day-to-day operations pursuant to a proxy structure mandated by the U.S. government. In October 2012, Applied Communication Sciences relocated its headquarters to Basking Ridge, New Jersey, occupying the former headquarters of AT&amp;T Wireless.

In February 2013, Ericsson launched &quot;iconectiv&quot; for its interconnection business. During this time, Ericsson maintained its corporate presence in Plano, Texas and iconectiv&#x27;s corporate presence in New Jersey. In July 2017, iconectiv moved its headquarters from Piscataway to Bridgewater, New Jersey. 

In August 2024, Ericson announced a sale of iconnectiv to Koch Equity for $1 billion.

==Francisco Partners investment==
On August 10, 2017, Francisco Partners announced a $200 million investment in iconectiv and received a 16.7 percent ownership stake in the company.

==Notable clients==
In 2015, iconectiv won a contract procured by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC). The service had been operated by Neustar Inc. for 18 years. iconectiv completed the transition from Neustar on May 29, 2018 becoming the Local Number Portability Administrator (LNPA) for the United States.

iconectiv was awarded the contract from CTIA to provide Common Short Code (CSC) Registry Services, effective January 1, 2016.

In 2019, the Secure Telephone Identity Governance Authority (STI-GA) selected iconnectiv as the U.S. STI Policy Administrator for supervising measures to ensure voice calls have accurate caller ID.

<text>Gasherbrum () is a remote group of peaks situated at the northeastern end of the Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram mountain range. The peaks are located within the border region of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan and Xinjiang, China. The massif contains three of the world&#x27;s 8,000 metre peaks (if Broad Peak is included). 
The highly visible face of Gasherbrum IV has gained the nickname the &quot;Shining Wall&quot; and this has often been claimed as the meaning of the word &quot;Gasherbrum&quot;.
 However the name Gasherbrum comes from &quot;rgasha&quot; (beautiful) + &quot;brum&quot; (mountain) in Balti, hence it actually means &quot;beautiful mountain&quot;.

== Geography ==
The Gasherbrum range forms the continental divide of southern Asia; drainage to the north and east flows into the Tarim Basin, drainage to the south and west flows into the Arabian Sea.

== History ==
In 1856, Thomas George Montgomerie, a British Royal Engineers lieutenant and a member of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India, sighted a group of high peaks in the Karakoram from more than 200 km away. He named five of these peaks K1, K2, K3, K4 and K5, where the &quot;K&quot; denotes Karakoram. Today, K1 is known as Masherbrum, K3 as Gasherbrum IV, K4 as Gasherbrum II and K5 as Gasherbrum I. Only K2, the second highest mountain in the world, has retained Montgomerie&#x27;s name. Broad Peak was thought to miss out on a K-number as it was hidden from Montgomerie&#x27;s view by Masherbrum.

<text>John Awena-ika-lani-keahi-o-ka-lua-o-Pele Carey Lane, (July 22, 1872 – February 8, 1958) was Mayor of Honolulu from 1915 to 1917.

== Early years ==

Born at Makao, Oʻahu, Lane was educated at Hauula School and St. Louis College. He held various jobs as a clerk, and from 1893 to 1900 farmed near Honolulu. John Lane was one of 12 children born of William Carey Lane (1821–1895), an Irish sea captain, and Mary Kukeakalani Kahooilimoku, a Koolau chiefess. Born in County Cork, Ireland, his father was said to be a descendant of Irish kings. Lane&#x27;s grandfather, a staunch Catholic, had forfeited his lands and moved to New York, taking his son William with him. William Carey Lane later ended up in Hawaii where he married a Hawaiian chiefess. Kukeakalani was the daughter of Kukanaloa, a member of King Kamehameha I&#x27;s court who served as the keeper of the king&#x27;s personal war canoe.

== Military service ==
John and his brothers, Lot and James, were members of Queen Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s personal guard at ʻIolani Palace.

They were avowed royalists, and John Lane &quot;was at her side when they usurped control and dethroned her in 1893, and was among those who took part in the counter-revolution in 1895 with the hope of restoring her throne and native Hawaiian rule,&quot; wrote Kathleen Dickensen Mellen in a 1954 Honolulu Advertiser article. He was captured during the Battle of Diamond Head along with Harry Bertleman, a fellow insurgent. He was charged with treason but later acquitted.

== Political life ==
Lane was a devoted follower of the monarchy and joined the Hawaii Republican Party to be aligned with Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana&#x27;ole. Lane became a member of the Hawaii Territorial Senate from 1905 to 1907 and introduced the bill establishing the City and County of Honolulu. He married Alice Kia Nāhaolelua on March 13, 1909 at Honolulu. He failed to win the post of mayor in 1908 and 1910, but was elected by an overwhelming majority in 1914. He was defeated in his bid for re-election in 1917 by the previous mayor Joseph J. Fern. Appointed high sheriff of the territory and warden of Oʻahu Prison in 1922, he resigned in 1932 during charges of lax administration and because of ramifications of the Massie Trial. He continued his political career until 1948.

<text>East Isles is a neighborhood within the larger Calhoun Isles community in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.

It lies between Hennepin Avenue to the east, Lake of the Isles to the west, West Lake Street to the south, and West 22nd Street to the north. Together with parts of Lowry Hill East and other nearby neighborhoods, East Isles is part of the larger, unofficial, Uptown neighborhood. It is mostly located in Ward 7, represented by council member Katie Cashman; A few blocks on the far south of the neighborhood are in Ward 10, represented by Aisha Chughtai.

The neighborhood was originally a part of the more historically affluent neighborhoods around Lake of the Isles: Kenwood and Lowry Hill. However, since the 1940s, it has become more urbanized than the rest of the community, since numerous apartment buildings have been built in the area. Old mansions still can be found in the neighborhood.

==History==
Architects William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie designed the Catherine Gray House in this neighborhood, at 2409 Lake of the Isles Boulevard; it is currently owned by Brian and Mary Longe. Purcell built the Catherine Gray House (his first project) for his grandmother, who funded the project to help Purcell and Elmslie launch their new firm. Purcell lived in the house with his grandmother until he married his wife Edna. After many years of alterations and much white paint, the house had lost most of its Prairie School characteristics. The Longes completed an extensive historical restoration to the exterior in 2005-2006, returning it to its original appearance. It is a fine example of early Prairie School in Minneapolis.

Behind the Catherine Gray House, on Lake Place, is another significant project by Purcell &amp; Elmslie - the Purcell-Cutts House. The Purcell-Cutts House was originally called the Edna Purcell House, named for his wife. Purcell and his wife lived in this home and raised their two sons there. The Cutts family bought the house years later and lived there for many years. They donated the home to the Minneapolis Institute of Art. The home is now operated as a museum and is open to the public for tours. Signs denoting the neighborhood incorporate the window designs of this house.

<text>The Daily Sketch was a British national tabloid newspaper, founded in Manchester in 1909 by Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet. 

The &quot;Sketch&quot; was Conservative in its politics and populist in its tone during its existence through all its changes of ownership.

==History==
In 1920, Lord Rothermere&#x27;s Daily Mirror Newspapers bought the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;. In 1925 Rothermere sold it to William and Gomer Berry (later Viscount Camrose and Viscount Kemsley). In 1926 it absorbed the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot;.

It was owned by a subsidiary of the Berrys&#x27; Allied Newspapers from 1928 (renamed Kemsley Newspapers in 1937 when Camrose withdrew to concentrate his efforts on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;). From this point forward, its sister newspaper was the &quot;Sunday Graphic&quot;.

In 1946, twenty years after it had taken over the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot;, the latter name was revived and the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; name disappeared for a while.

In 1952, Kemsley decided to sell the paper to Associated Newspapers, the owner of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which promptly revived the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; name in 1953. 

In 1954, an infamous cartoon, titled &quot;Family Portrait?&quot;, was published in the paper, which mocked Billy Strachan, a black British civil rights leader, for his anti-colonial and anti-imperialist beliefs. The cartoon depicted him with devil horns representing the Caribbean Labour Congress. His image was posed with images of Hewlett Johnson and Paul Robeson, all of whom stood underneath a portrait of the then recently deceased Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.

The paper participated in the 1965 press campaign against the screening of the BBC film &quot;The War Game&quot;.

The paper struggled through the 1950s and 1960s, never managing to compete successfully with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and on Tuesday, 11 May 1971, it closed and merged with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which had just switched to tabloid format.

<doc id="1141989" wikidata="Q7707395" url="?curid=1141989" title="Texas's 8th congressional district">
<text>Texas&#x27;s 8th congressional district of the United States House of Representatives includes all of Polk and San Jacinto counties, and parts of Harris, Walker, and Montgomery counties. It includes much of the northern outlying areas of metro Houston, including Conroe, Magnolia, and most of Lake Livingston. The current Representative from the 8th district is Morgan Luttrell and has been since 2023.

==District history==
Texas received an eighth congressional district through reapportionment in 1881 as a result of population growth reflected in the 1880 census and in 1883, James Francis Miller, a Democrat, was elected its first representative. From 1882-1892 the district was located in South Central Texas between Houston and San Antonio and was represented by Democrats. After 1893, the district was located in North Texas and was represented by a Republican representative from Fort Worth and then a Democrat from Weatherford. After the redistricting of 1902, the district shifted to Southeast Texas and the area outside of Houston and was represented by Congressmen from Huntsville, Hempstead and Richmond. From 1910-1959, the 8th district comprised all of Harris County and the city of Houston.

In 1958, part of southern Harris County became the 22nd district. The 8th and 22nd districts were separated by a boundary consisting roughly of what is now U.S. 290, the western and southern portions of Loop 610, and the portion of Buffalo Bayou east of downtown Houston including the Houston Ship Channel. Everything north of this boundary remained in the 8th.

The district was redrawn mid-decade in 1966 after the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; two years earlier that congressional district populations had to be equal or close to equal in population. As a result, Houston was split between the 7th, 8th, 9th and 22nd districts. For the next 17 years, the 8th was anchored by northern Houston.

By the 1970s, the 8th district was beginning to move away from its traditional Democratic roots, and in 1980 it elected a Republican congressman, Jack Fields, over liberal seven-term incumbent Bob Eckhardt. After the 1980 census, the 8th district was pushed further north to include conservative areas of northern Harris County (such as Fields&#x27; home in Humble) as well as the wealthier portions of Montgomery County, The 8th district&#x27;s borders changed drastically in the 1990s round of redistricting, which was orchestrated by the Democratic-controlled state legislature as well as then-Congressman Martin Frost, the senior Democrat in the congressional delegation. The new 8th district was designed to pack in as many Republicans as possible and was described by some critics as the &quot;dumbbell district&quot; because of its strange shape. The western half of the district contained parts of Waller, Austin, and Washington counties, as well as much of Brazos County, which is home to the conservative bastion Texas A&amp;M University. The eastern half of the district took in nearly all of now-heavily Republican Montgomery County, as well as Republican areas in northern Harris County. The two halves were joined together by a narrow tendril in Waller County. Fields continued to represent the district until his retirement in 1996, when he was succeeded by fellow Republican Kevin Brady.

The 8th district was made somewhat more compact after the 2000 census, taking in nearly all of Montgomery County and most of northern Harris County. However, it changed dramatically during the 2003 redistricting plan engineered by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Republican from Texas&#x27;s 22nd district. DeLay wanted to dislodge 4-term Democratic Congressman Jim Turner from the neighboring 2nd district, who represented a district located in East Texas that was predominantly rural and had begun moving away from its Democratic roots (Bush received 63% of the vote there in 2000). Brady&#x27;s 8th district lost most of its share of Houston, instead absorbing nearly all of the southern portion of the old 2nd district. Although geographically the new 8th was more Turner&#x27;s district than Brady&#x27;s, half its population came from Brady&#x27;s base in Montgomery County, which has as many people as the rest of the district combined. The new 8th district was so heavily Republican (Bush would have carried it in 2000 with 69% of the vote) that Turner declined to run for reelection. Brady has been reelected from this district four times with only nominal opposition. In 2020, Brady fended off a primary challenge and won re-election against Democrat Elizabeth Hernandez and Libertarian Chris Duncan with 72.5% of the vote.

Due to redistricting in 2012, Texas&#x27;s 8th district lost its entire eastern half, with Orange, Newton, Jasper, Tyler, Hardin, Polk, and Liberty counties being removed from the district. Counties added include all of Trinity, Houston, Grimes, Madison, and the southern half of Leon County.

in 2022, Kevin Brady, who eventually rose to become Chairman of the influential House Ways and Means Committee (where he notably shepherded the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017), announced his retirement from Congress. At the same time, Brady&#x27;s hometown of The Woodlands was redrawn into the 2nd District of neighboring Republican Dan Crenshaw, while the 8th was redrawn to now cover all areas of Montgomery County north of The Woodlands along with southern portions of Walker County, all of San Jacinto and Polk counties (including Lake Livingston) and a western section of Harris County that includes a sizable number of middle-class Hispanics with neighborhoods that vary in composure from heavily Republican to heavily Democratic (including some that were central to the Democrats&#x27; pickup of the traditionally Republican 7th District in the 2018 elections). The new district remains heavily Republican, even though the Harris County portion is considered more competitive than the overwhelmingly Republican remainder of the district.

On March 1, 2022 the Texas Republican primary was held. Morgan Luttrell won the primary with 52.2% of the vote against 11 different challengers. Christian Collins held 2nd at 22.2% and Jonathan Hullihan in 3rd with 12.6%. Luttrell defeated Democratic nominee Laura Jones on November 8, 2022.

<text>St Donat&#x27;s Castle (), St Donats, Wales, is a medieval castle in the Vale of Glamorgan, about to the west of Cardiff, and about to the west of Llantwit Major. Positioned on cliffs overlooking the Bristol Channel, the site has been occupied since the Iron Age, and was by tradition the home of the Celtic chieftain Caradog. The present castle&#x27;s origins date from the 12th century when the de Haweys and later Peter de Stradling began its development. The Stradlings held the castle for four hundred years, until the death of Sir Thomas Stradling in a duel in 1738.

During the 18th century, the castle&#x27;s status and condition declined and by the early 19th century it was only partly habitable. The later 19th and early 20th centuries saw several restorations. In 1852, it was purchased by John Whitlock Nicholl Carne, who claimed descent from the Stradlings but whose efforts at reconstruction were not well regarded. More enlightened improvements were made by its subsequent owner, the coal magnate Morgan Stuart Williams.

The castle&#x27;s transformation occurred after its purchase in 1925 by William Randolph Hearst, the American newspaper tycoon. Hearst undertook a &quot;brutal&quot; expansion, including the incorporation of elements from other ancient structures such as the roofs of Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire and St Botolph&#x27;s Church in Lincolnshire. His approach to architectural reclamation was controversial and the destruction of Bradenstoke was opposed in a vigorous campaign organised by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Bernard Shaw described the castle after Hearst&#x27;s reconstruction as &quot;what God would have built if he had had the money&quot;. Despite spending vast sums of money on St Donat&#x27;s, Hearst rarely visited and in 1937, with the Hearst Corporation facing financial collapse, the castle was put up for sale, but with war looming, the castle was instead requisitioned for use by the army.

In 1960, some nine years after Hearst&#x27;s death, it was purchased by the son of the businessman and educational philanthropist Antonin Besse and donated to the trustees of Atlantic College, the first of the United World Colleges. Today the castle is home to some 350 international students and, with a history of occupation extending back to the late 13th century, is among the oldest continuously inhabited castles in Wales. Both the castle and the grounds are of historical and architectural importance, and have Grade I listed status.

==History==
===Stradling family: 1300–1738===
According to tradition, the site of St Donat&#x27;s was the place to which Caradog, the Celtic chieftain, returned after being released from imprisonment in Rome by the emperor Claudius. After the Norman invasion of Wales in the mid-11th century, a timber castle was constructed on the site. The earliest surviving parts of the present castle, the keep and the inner ward, were built in the late 12th century by the de Hawey family. Ownership passed to the Stradling family through the marriage of Sir Peter Stradling to Joan de Hawey. The Stradlings were adventurers from Strättligen in Switzerland, who came to South Wales in the late 13th century. Sir Peter, his wife and later her second husband John de Pembridge, extended the castle around 1300, building the outer gatehouse and curtain wall and enlarging the keep and inner gatehouse.

The Stradling family served as magistrates, members of parliament, sheriffs and deputy lieutenants of Glamorganshire from the 13th to the 18th centuries. A number achieved more than local fame. The third Sir Edward Stradling, in a run of nine Edwards, fought at the Battle of Agincourt, married a great-granddaughter of Edward III and established himself as a powerful landowner and courtier. One of Edward&#x27;s sons, Henry, was seized by pirates in the Bristol Channel while travelling from his Somerset estates to St Donat&#x27;s, and was released only on payment of a large ransom. This event has subsequently been much embellished by, among others, Taliesin Williams in his account &quot;The Doom of Colyn Dolphyn: A Poem, with Notes Illustrative of Various Traditions of Glamorganshire&quot;, which involves the eponymous Breton pirate and the witch Mallt-y-Nos. 
Henry Stradling&#x27;s nautical misadventures continued; after acceding to the baronetcy, he died of a fever at Famagusta, returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.The Stradlings remained adherents of the Catholic faith following the Reformation and experienced persecution as a consequence. Sir Thomas Stradling (1495–1571) was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1561, following accusations of his having used the appearance of a &quot;miraculous&quot; cross in the trunk of an ash tree on the St Donat&#x27;s estate to encourage support for the Catholic cause. 

His son, the scholar Edward Stradling (1528/9–1609) established a celebrated, and exceptionally large, library at St Donat&#x27;s, which was considered the finest in Wales of its time. The historian Graham Thomas records the Stradling tradition of educating their sons abroad, which led to the library holding extensive collections of foreign-language texts, particularly Italian works. Edward Stradling wrote a history of the area, &quot;The Winning of the Lordship of Glamorgan out of Welshmen&#x27;s Hands&quot;, which established the legend of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, including the inaccurate claim that the first Stradlings had arrived with William the Conqueror, rather than some 200 years later. He was also the patron of Siôn Dafydd Rhys and funded the production and publication of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Cambrobrytannicae Cymraecaeve Linguae Institutiones et Rudimenta&quot;, the first Welsh language grammar to be published in Latin and thus widely accessible.

During the English Civil War the Stradlings, prominent Royalists, supported Charles I and hosted the archbishop James Ussher, when he had to flee Cardiff. Three Stradlings fought at the Battle of St Fagans in 1648 and two were forced into exile after the King&#x27;s execution. After the Civil War, the family declined in importance and ceased to occupy any significant position in the country and, ultimately, within Glamorgan. They retained ownership of St Donat&#x27;s Castle until the death of Sir Thomas Stradling in a duel in France in 1738. The exact circumstances of his death are uncertain; he was travelling with his university friend Sir John Tyrwhitt, with whom he had reputedly made a pact, each promising the other his inheritance in the event of his death. Sources dispute whether the duel was actually between Stradling and Tyrwhitt, or was contrived by Tyrwhitt. In either event, Stradling was killed and Tyrwhitt inherited his estates.

===Decline and recovery: 1739–1925===

Under the Tyrwhitts, the castle entered a long decline that lasted over one hundred years. J. M. W. Turner sketched the partly-ruinous castle in 1798. John Wesley is reputed to have preached to a crowd of five thousand people on the terraced lawns in 1777. Partial restoration was started by Dr John Whitlock Nicholl Carne, who claimed to be descended from the Stradlings, and bought the castle from the Tyrwhitt-Drake family in 1862. Carne&#x27;s reconstructions have not generally been well-regarded; the historian of the castle Alan Hall described the work as being undertaken in an &quot;unscholarly, inauthentic style&quot;. A more sympathetic, contemporaneous, account described Carne&#x27;s efforts as &quot;careful and scrupulous&quot;.

Morgan Williams, a colliery owner from Aberpergwm and the owner in the Edwardian period, from 1901 to 1909, carried out extensive and careful restoration, employing the noted architects George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner. Williams&#x27;s sensitive reconstructions were praised by Henry Avray Tipping, the writer, architect and garden designer. The architectural writer Michael Hall was also impressed, describing Bodley&#x27;s drawing room as &quot;Edwardian antiquarian taste at its most refined&quot;. The process of reconstruction was less harmonious, Williams and Garner rowed constantly and Garner ultimately resigned. Almost all of Bodley and Garner&#x27;s work was eradicated in the &quot;brutal&quot; remodelling undertaken by William Randolph Hearst. Williams also assembled a collection of arms and armour which was housed at the castle, and made major improvements to the castle&#x27;s setting, moving the village which previously stood close to the castle&#x27;s walls to a new location outside of the gates and constructing three entrance lodges. In 1903, the novelist Violet Paget, writing under her pseudonym Vernon Lee, used the castle as the model for St Salvat&#x27;s Castle in her Gothic novel &quot;Penelope Brandling: A Tale of the Welsh Coast in the Eighteenth Century&quot;. Godfrey Williams, Morgan&#x27;s son, disliked St Donat&#x27;s, by tradition on account of its being haunted although this is disputed, and in 1921, having first culled the herd of deer that his father had reintroduced to the park, put the castle up for sale. Its advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot;, dated 3 May 1921, described the castle as &quot;a comfortable and liveable old-world home of the first importance&quot;. In 1922, it was bought, along with of land, by Richard Pennoyer, an American diplomat married to the Dowager Countess of Shrewsbury. Pennoyer was to own St Donat&#x27;s for less than three years.

===William Randolph Hearst: 1925–1960===
William Randolph Hearst inherited a mining and real estate fortune from his mother, and made a fortune of his own through the establishment of the Hearst Corporation, the largest newspaper and magazine company in the world. Part of the revenues were spent on the building of San Simeon, his Spanish-style castle in California, which began construction in 1919. By 1925 he was eager to purchase a genuine castle, and on 13 August he sent a wire to Alice Head, the London-based managing director of his European operations, &quot;Want buy castle in England . St Donat&#x27;s perhaps satisfactory at proper price. See if you can get right price on St Donat&#x27;s or any other equally good.&quot; Within two months it was Hearst&#x27;s, or specifically, the property of the National Magazine Company. The price paid for the castle and of surrounding land was $130,000. Hearst employed Sir Charles Allom as his architect and designer. Allom was a noted decorator, the founder of White Allom and Company, and had been knighted in 1913 for his redecoration of Buckingham Palace.

Hearst attracted strong opinions. Theodore Roosevelt called him &quot;an unspeakable blackguard (with) all the worst faults of the corrupt and dissolute monied man&quot;. Winston Churchill, who stayed as Hearst&#x27;s guest at St Donat&#x27;s and at San Simeon, described him in a letter to Clementine Churchill as &quot;a grave simple child – with no doubt a nasty temper – playing with the most costly toys ... two magnificent establishments, two charming wives, complete indifference to public opinion, oriental hospitalities&quot;. Churchill&#x27;s mention of &quot;two charming wives&quot; refers to Marion Davies, Hearst&#x27;s long-time mistress and a constant presence at both San Simeon and St Donat&#x27;s. P. G. Wodehouse, invited to San Simeon, recalled Hearst&#x27;s way of dealing with over-staying guests: &quot;The longer you are there, the further you get from the middle [of the refectory dining table]. I sat on Marion&#x27;s right the first night, then found myself being edged further and further away till I got to the extreme end, when I thought it time to leave. Another day, and I should have been feeding on the floor.&quot;Hearst undertook a &quot;rapid and ruthless&quot; redevelopment and rebuilding programme at St Donat’s. He spent around £250,000 on repairs, reconstruction, refurbishment, and furnishings between 1925 and 1937, renovating the castle with architectural trophies from across the United Kingdom and abroad; at the peak of his buying, Hearst&#x27;s expenditure reportedly accounted for a quarter of the world&#x27;s entire art market. Alice Head, manager of Hearst&#x27;s London operations and the actual purchaser of St Donat&#x27;s, recorded her exhilaration: &quot;We were on top of the wave – out of (one) year&#x27;s profits, we bought &quot;The Connoisseur&quot;, we bought St Donat&#x27;s and we bought vast quantities of antiques.&quot; The writer Clive Aslet described Hearst&#x27;s passion for antiquities as &quot;naked obsession... romance gave way to rape&quot;, and his mania for collecting was satirised in Orson Welles&#x27;s 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Kane&#x27;s palace Xanadu, modelled on San Simeon, is described as containing &quot;A collection of everything, so big that it can never be catalogued or appraised. Enough for ten museums, the loot of the world.&quot; Hearst&#x27;s actions were vigorously opposed, particularly in relation to the destruction of the Augustinian foundation Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire. Built in 1142, by the 20th century the priory was in poor repair. Hearst purchased the site in 1929, under conditions of secrecy, and had workmen take down the cloister, tithe barn, prior&#x27;s lodging and refectory. Parts were shipped to California; major elements were incorporated into St Donat&#x27;s as part of the newly created Bradenstoke Hall; while other pieces, including the tithe barn, were lost. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings ran a poster campaign on the London Underground, using text that was considered libellous and which had to be pasted over. The campaign also saw questions on the issue being raised in Parliament. Hearst was unconcerned, Miss Head responding to the SPAB secretary: &quot;Mr Hearst and I are well aware of your views. You must please allow us to hold our own opinions.&quot;

Hearst did not visit until September 1928, and even then spent only one night in residence. Having undertaken a night-time tour of the castle which was illuminated by kerosene lamps, he left the following morning to board the &quot;Berengaria&quot; for New York. During the voyage home he wrote a 25-page memorandum with instructions for further improvements to the castle. Over the next decade his time at St Donat&#x27;s amounted to some four months; between his purchase in 1925 and his death in 1951 he visited, normally for a month at the end of his summer European tours, in 1930, 1931, 1934 and, for the last time, in 1936. His infrequent visits were invariably undertaken with a large entourage, whom he sometimes took for drinks to the Old Swan Inn at the nearby village of Llantwit Major. Among his guests were the actors Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn and Clark Gable, in addition to politicians including Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George and a young John F. Kennedy, who visited with his parents, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy. Visiting writers included Elinor Glyn, Ivor Novello and Bernard Shaw. Of St Donat&#x27;s, Shaw was quoted as saying: &quot;This is what God would have built if he had had the money.&quot;

In the late 1930s Hearst&#x27;s publishing empire came close to collapse. St Donat&#x27;s was put up for sale in 1937, the Hearst Corporation noting that it had invested £280,000 in the castle through its subsidiary the National Magazine Company. An opinion on the chances of recouping this sum was sought from James Milner, a prominent solicitor and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. His response was not encouraging: &quot;We have at St Donat&#x27;s a white elephant of the rarest species.&quot; Billy Butlin, the holiday-camp entrepreneur, was uninterested and a development proposal by Sir Julian Hodge did not progress. Much of the furniture, silver and works of art were disposed of in a series of sales conducted by Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s which began in 1937 and continued for some years, with many items failing to achieve the prices Hearst had originally spent.

During World War II, the castle was requisitioned by the War Office for use by British and American personnel for training purposes. In October 1939, the 2/5th Battalion of the British Army&#x27;s Welch Regiment arrived at the castle; two years later, Auxiliary Territorial Service personnel were also stationed at the site. In 1944, it was used by the US 2nd Infantry Division as a command post, and Allied soldiers injured in the Normandy landings were treated and housed there. Hearst did not return after the war but continued to lend the castle to friends; Bob Hope, the comedian, stayed in May 1951 during his visit for a golf tournament at Porthcawl.

===United World Colleges: 1960–present===
Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College, the first of what would become the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Schule Schloss Salem in Germany and Gordonstoun in Scotland, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, who would become the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.

The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was invented, developed, and patented by Hoare at St Donat&#x27;s in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat&#x27;s design to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI&#x27;s cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle&#x27;s seafront facilities hosted an RNLI lifeboat station, which was staffed by students and faculty of the college, and was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. 

The college has hosted several royal visitors at the castle, including Charles III, when Prince of Wales, and Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Lord Mountbatten, who was closely involved with the UWC movement, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan and Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands. The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a visit from Queen Noor of Jordan, the then President of the United World Colleges. Politicians such as the former prime minister of Canada Lester B. Pearson and the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Alec Douglas-Home also visited St Donat&#x27;s, as have several ambassadors.

The college is home to approximately 350 students from more than 90 countries, who live in houses constructed on the castle grounds for the two years of their studies. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat&#x27;s has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales.

==Architecture and description==

Detailed drawings and plans prepared by the engineer and antiquary George Thomas Clark in 1871, and subsequently by George Lambert in 1901, assisted the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW) in their survey of the castle published in 2000. In this survey, RCAHMW described the development of the castle in six phases: Period 1, the late-12th century; Period 2, the early-14th century; Period 3, the late-15th century; Period 4, the early-16th century; Period 5, the late-16th or early-17th centuries and finally the restorations of Carne, Williams and Hearst. The survey identified &quot;substantial&quot; remnants of the original Norman enceinte, including the keep, which had been enveloped by later developments and had previously been unrecognised and unrecorded.

The entrance lies to the north-west. The grouping is surrounded by outer and inner curtain walls. The outer curtain wall is pierced by a gatehouse which leads through to an outer court. This is blocked, to the left, by Hearst&#x27;s Bradenstoke Hall. A further gate, adjacent to the Mansell Tower, leads onto the inner court with the great hall to the south-west, the Bradenstoke Hall behind that, the banqueting hall to the west and the North Range to the right of the inner gatehouse.

===Exterior===
The castle site offers natural defences, in the form of steep slopes to two sides and the coast to a third. The unprotected side to the east is encircled by a deep dry moat. The castle is built of local lias limestone rubble with Sutton stone and sandstone dressings. The outer gatehouse is approached through modern battlements. The gatehouse has a portcullis room above, with an original fireplace of and a wooden portcullis with wooden doors behind. The first (outer) court beyond is the earliest part of the castle, constructed by the de Haweys in the late-12th century to replace a Norman timber fortification. The most recent RCAHMW survey, published in 2000, identified &quot;significant vestiges&quot; of the earliest stone castle which had been missed by earlier surveys. This discovery enabled a definitive dating for the first stone-built castle to &quot;before 1200&quot;. The architectural historian John Newman draws comparisons with Newcastle at Bridgend and Coity Castle. To the sides of this gateway are a domestic range and the Brewhouse, the last major additions made by the Stradlings. The inner wall mostly survives and has a small original tower to the north, and a square gatehouse on the east beside the rectangular Mansell Tower, an enlargement of the original keep. In an article in &quot;The Archaeological Journal&quot;, C. P. Spurgeon notes the design similarities between the tower&#x27;s door jambs and those in the chancel of St Donat&#x27;s church, indicating an earlier construction date than that of the work undertaken by Peter de Stradling.

Through this gateway, a c. wide inner court is positioned within a polygonal inner curtain wall. The curtain walls date from c. 1300, and were built by the founder of the Stradling family, or perhaps by his widow&#x27;s second husband. The north-west range dates from the early-16th century; the north-east range is of the late-15th century as is the great hall on the south side of the court. The double-height bay windows date from Bodley and Garner&#x27;s remodelling for Morgan Williams. Alan Hall describes the inner court as having a &quot;peaceful and domestic&quot; appearance having been constructed in the more settled Tudor period under the later Stradlings.

The exterior walls of the inner ward are decorated with a set of terracotta medallions or busts. The writer Simon Jenkins suggests it is unclear whether they are original to the castle or imported from elsewhere, although the architectural historian John Newman records that they were in situ by 1804. They appear to be modelled on the busts of the emperors by Giovanni da Maiano at Hampton Court. There are differing views as to the provenance of the medallions. Cadw is certain that two, those said to depict Marcus Aurelius and Cleopatra, are by da Maiano and were originally part of the Hampton Court set. It also suggests they could have been installed as early as the 16th century. Alan Hall agrees, noting the close connection between Cardinal Wolsey, to whom Pope Leo X had presented them, and Sir Thomas Arundell, father-in-law of the fourth Sir Edward Stradling. Newman is less definitive, although he notes their varying quality and suggests that further investigation should be undertaken.

Beside the hall, between the inner and outer curtain walls, is the Bradenstoke Hall, consisting of the inner curtain wall on the north side and the realigned outer curtain wall on the south, with a modern wall on the east end built at that point to fit in an early-14th-century roof, brought from Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire. The western range has largely been replaced by a larger, three-storey building which necessitated, when erected, the demolition of the western part of the outer curtain wall. All of this renewal was undertaken by Hearst to achieve larger spaces for entertaining. The historian Adrian Pettifer records St Donat&#x27;s as the last inhabited castle in Wales to undergo major alteration, describing that Hearst &quot;aggrandised it with plunder&quot;.

===Interior===

The historian Anthony Emery, in the second of his three-volume history, &quot;Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300–1500&quot;, describes the interiors created by Hearst and Allom at St Donat&#x27;s as &quot;spectacular...surpassing all other work there in size and richness&quot;. Their joint creation, the Bradenstoke Hall, contains two large fireplaces of French origin as well as the eponymous, imported roof. The banqueting hall, on the ground floor of the west range, is another example of Hearst&#x27;s indiscriminate use of architectural salvage. The roof is 15th-century, probably Flemish and was acquired from St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Boston, Lincolnshire. It has coloured ceiling bosses depicting a wide array of subjects, including flowers, griffins, the beasts of the Apostles and a head of Christ. The fireplace, cut to fit and with jambs from a different piece, is from a château in Beauvais. The entrance screen is from a Devon church. Hearst&#x27;s breakfast room, off the banqueting hall, reuses another piece of the St Botolph&#x27;s ceiling, as well as a fireplace from the prior&#x27;s lodgings at Bradenstoke. The library above contains a major example of linenfold panelling, the Ellenhall Wainscot. Originally from a Staffordshire manor house, the panelling was sold to a dealer by the Earl of Lichfield in 1918 and subsequently acquired by Hearst. The Lady Anne Tower on the south-western corner is a Hearst/Allom reconstruction of the original 16th-century tower. The north range interior was remodelled in the late 1920s and contains Hearst&#x27;s and Davies&#x27;s bedroom suites, with an interconnecting door concealed in the panelling of Hearst&#x27;s room. The panelling of Hearst&#x27;s bedroom is original, but not to its current location. Allom salvaged it from the Stradling&#x27;s Red Parlour, which Hearst demolished. Alan Hall notes the similarity of the panelling to that in the Senior Common Room at Jesus College, Oxford, a foundation attended and supported by members of the Welsh gentry, including the Stradlings.

Above the banqueting hall, Hearst created an armoury filled with a notable collection of arms and armour, mainly sourced by the dealer, Raymond Bartel, whom Hearst enticed from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. The collection, sold after Hearst&#x27;s death, was at the time &quot;one of the finest in the world&quot;, mainly bought at German auctions in the 1920s and 1930s and including a set of plate armour from Milan considered the earliest near-complete set in existence. In addition to the armour, Hearst assembled a considerable collection of art and antiquities at the castle; &quot;must buy many things for St Donat&#x27;s&quot;; including a large number of 17th and 18th century English portraits, Classical Greek vases, and tapestries.

The castle was designated a Grade I listed building, the highest possible grade reserved for buildings of exceptional interest, in 1952. Cadw&#x27;s listing report describes St Donat&#x27;s as &quot;an exceptionally fine medieval castle (with) many important interiors&quot;.

===St Donat&#x27;s Arts Centre and other college buildings===
St Donat&#x27;s Arts Centre is housed in a tithe barn of medieval origin but predominantly 16th-century in construction. The barn has been converted to a professionally equipped theatre which runs a programme of cinema, exhibitions and festivals. The Glass House is a modern addition and has been described as &quot;aggressively detailed&quot; but offering &quot;spectacular&quot; views. John Newman considered that the other developments undertaken by the college, although to designs of &quot;uncompromising modernity&quot;, neither &quot;detract from the historic castle (nor) impinge on its setting&quot;.

===Gardens and grounds===

The original gardens of the Stradlings were famous, begun in the Tudor period by Sir Thomas Stradling. They were extended by his son, Sir Edward Stradling, after a long sojourn in Rome. The Tudor Stradlings also maintained two deer parks on the wider estate, one for red and one for fallow deer. The Welsh poet Thomas Leyson, a friend of Sir Edward, composed a tribute in Latin, suggesting that the beauty of the gardens was sufficient to encourage visits from the sea-god Neptune and the water-nymph Thetis. The gardens descend in a series of terraces to the sea and give distant views across the Bristol Channel towards Devon and Somerset.

Later development in the early 20th century by Morgan Williams saw the establishment of a Tudor-style garden with carved heraldic beasts on pedestals. This was followed by additions by Hearst, including a number of garden structures, such as an Italianate summerhouse overlooking the Rose Garden in which he installed a telephone exchange with connections to New York and California. Hearst built a long outdoor swimming pool on the lowest terrace, on the site of the castle&#x27;s medieval tilt-yard. The pool was designed by Allom, assisted by Julia Morgan, Hearst&#x27;s main architect for San Simeon. Beyond the pool site are the Cavalry Barracks. Newman dates these as 17th-century, but both Alan Hall and Cadw suggest a slightly earlier dating, in the 16th century, as a response to the threat of Spanish invasion. They were certainly converted to stabling, from whence the name derives, in the 17th century, and the Stradlings kept their horses at the barracks during the Civil War. By the 20th century the barracks were in a ruinous state and Hearst converted them into guest accommodation and a pool house in the 1930s. Between 1978 and 1981 Atlantic College rebuilt them in the original 17th-century style to serve as student accommodation. The college installed an indoor swimming pool and replaced the Allom/Morgan outdoor pool. Beyond the barracks, the castellated sea walls and towers have their origins in the 16th century, but were completely reconstructed by Hearst in the 1920s. The watchtower on the opposite slope to the castle is also probably 16th-century, or possibly late-15th-century, and is shown in a state of completion in a view of the castle dated 1740. It decayed thereafter, was restored in the late-19th century, but is again derelict in the early 21st century. It was almost certainly intended as a seaward look-out.

Structural elements of the gardens were given Grade I listed status in 1963, Cadw&#x27;s listing report noting their &quot;exceptional interest as a surviving 16th-century terraced garden&quot;. Many of the individual buildings have their own Grade II listings including the watchtower to the west of the castle, the sea walls and towers to the south of the castle, at the end of the terraces, the Cavalry Barracks, the lawn sundial, and the walls to the north and west of the castle entrance. The gardens themselves were given Grade I listing on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales in 2022. They remain a rare survival of a complete, terraced Tudor garden, once among the finest Renaissance gardens in Wales.

<text>The Latymer School is a selective, mixed grammar school in Edmonton, London, England, established in 1624 by Edward Latymer. 

== History and traditions ==
Latymer was established in 1624 on Church Street, Edmonton by bequest of Edward Latymer, a London City merchant in Hammersmith. Although most of his wealth passed to the people of Hammersmith and the Parish of St Dunstan&#x27;s (now Latymer Upper School), he named certain properties and estates to fund the education and livelihoods of &quot;eight poore boies of Edmonton&quot; with a doublet, a pair of breeches, a shirt, a pair of woollen stockings and shoes distributed biannually on Ascension Day and All Saints&#x27; Day. Pupils wore the red Latymer cross on their sleeves.

In 1662, John Wild of Edmonton made a bequest for the annual maintenance of a schoolmaster and a poor scholar at Cambridge. In 1697, Thomas Style extended the bequest to fund the education of &quot;twenty poor boys ... Grammar and Latin tongue.&quot; Several similar benefactions produced about £550 per annum, which funded the instruction of more than one hundred boys, of which sixty were clothed. In 1811, Ann Wyatt, a widow from Hackney, willed her Navy Annuities for the construction and maintenance of a new school. The school-room was built in 1811 in accordance to her will.

The school did not take on Latymer&#x27;s name for some centuries; when it finally did, it was known as Latymer&#x27;s School. At some point, the apostrophe was dropped and the name modified to the Latymer School. It has been situated on its present site since 1910, when it also became coeducational. 

The school has formal links with St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (Edward Latymer&#x27;s College) and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (the College of Edward Latymer&#x27;s father, William Latymer) which have endowments which may be used for the furtherance of the studies of former Latymer pupils at those colleges.

In 1967 the school switched to a comprehensive intake as a result of Circular 10/65, a request from the Labour government to local education authorities to plan for conversion to a fully comprehensive education system. However, a certain amount of informal selection still took place in liaison with local primary schools.

In 1988, Latymer took advantage of the Education Reform Act 1988 to become a Grant-Maintained school with selective entrance exams once more. Grant-maintained status was abolished by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and Latymer reverted to voluntary aided status.

== Ofsted judgement and school ranking==
The school underwent its most recent Ofsted inspection on 24 March 2022, when it received an overall grade of &#x27;Good&#x27;, after having previously been graded &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; on 25 January 2008.

<doc id="1141999" wikidata="Q6214744" url="?curid=1141999" title="Jogger's Park">
<text>Jogger&#x27;s Park is a seaside jogging track along with a park in Bandra, Mumbai. It is situated at the southern end of the Carter Road. The park was opened to the public on 27 May 1990 and receives more than 2000 visitors on weekdays and double the number on Sundays. Its jogging track is 400 metres long. It features a mud strip for running and two paved tracks for walking or jogging.

Development of the park is credited to the city&#x27;s veteran hockey coach and former corporator, Oliver Andrade. Andrade&#x27;s effort to rope in films star Dilip Kumar and Sunil Dutt, transformed the site from a dumping ground into a jogging track. The movie star&#x27;s fund raising efforts led to financial assistance from the Rahejas, the Lokhandwalas and the Rizvi builders at a cost of ₹4 crore. In his memory, a plaque at the entrance of the park reads &quot;From Sir with Love&quot;. Mumbai&#x27;s first laughter club was launched at Joggers Park.

On 11th Feb 2022, the BMC passed a proposal to rename the Jogger&#x27;s Park as Sir Oliver Andrade Park.

==History==
Joggers Park was conceived by Oliver Andrade of Bandra, Bombay. Oliver Andrade was fondly called &quot;Sir&quot; as he was responsible for coaching Hockey and Football to thousands of students of St. Theresa&#x27;s Boys High School, St. Stanislaus High School and Sacred Heart Boys High School. Andrade wanted to develop a park for the citizens on a plot of land facing the sea in Bandra, which had turned into a dump yard over the years. He approached various eminent citizens of Mumbai, notably, Sunil Dutt, Dilip Kumar and pursued with various local and state authorities to get his plan sanctioned. 
As soon as he received a go-ahead from the authorities, Andrade raised money for the park by convincing the leading three construction companies who were located in Bandra. As a result of his effort, Lokhandwala Builders agreed to develop the cost &quot;pro bono&quot;. The external wall facing the sea was developed &quot;pro bono&quot; by Raheja Builders and Rizvi Builders. The founders of all these companies were former students of Andrade and they were happy to invest money in a cause that was for the citizens of Bombay.

==Park Management==
The Lokhandwala family agreed to manage the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the park. The family&#x27;s trust Bombay Suburban Civic Trust was the official caretaker of the park, having obtained the rights to manage the park from the Bombay Municipal Corporation. The MCGM regained control of the park from the Bombay Suburban Civic Trust on 31 January 2017.

==Entry Fee==
The park does not charge an entry fee since 1 February 2017. When the park was inaugurated, the entry fee was ₹1 which was increased to ₹2 a decade later. The original timings of the park (until 31 January 2017) was 5:30 AM to 9:30AM and 3:30PM to 9:00PM. However, after the takeover by the MCGM, the cooling time in the afternoon has been withdrawn and the park is open from 5:00AM to 9:00PM.

==Save Joggers Park==
Citizens and Joggers united under the banner of a spontaneous movement to save the park on 2 February 2017. This movement evolved into the Save Joggers Park Group which is pursuing the agenda of the upkeep of the park. The Save Joggers Park group includes thousands of patrons and users of the Joggers park. They have also initiated dialogues with elected representatives, municipal authorities and officials of the Garden department of MCGM.

<text>Maninderjeet Singh Bitta (also M.S. Bitta) is the chairman of the All-India Anti-Terrorist Front (AIATF), and former President of Indian Youth Congress. He was made President of Indian Youth Congress by P. V. Narasimha Rao. Maninderjeet Singh Bitta was a Minister in Punjab Government in the govt of Beant Singh.

==Attacks on his life==
*9 May 1992 : Bitta along with his friend Charanjit Singh Bedi was severely injured in a car bombing that killed 13 people in Amritsar on May 9, 1992.
*11 September 1993 : Bitta survived a deadly attack on him at Indian Youth Congress premises on Raisina Road, New Delhi. The blast occurred at mid-day as Maninderjeet Singh Bitta, then president of the then governing Congress Party&#x27;s youth wing, left his office in a car. His two bodyguards were among the dead. He escaped with shrapnel wounds to the chest, but 9 people were killed and 36 wounded. Burning tires and pieces of metal and glass were strewn across a 100-yard area near Parliament and many Government buildings. Rescuers pulled mangled bodies from damaged cars as smoke billowed into the sky. Passengers in a passing public bus were wounded. The death toll would probably have been much higher if it had not been raining heavily. After investigation, authorities named Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar, an affiliate of the Khalistan Liberation Force, as one of the persons responsible for the 1993 Raisina Road car bomb and is sentenced to death by hanging. Bhullar&#x27;s appeal against the conviction was dismissed by the Supreme Court of India on 27 December 2006. His plea for clemency was rejected by the President of India in May 2011. He again asked for commutation of hanging sentence, which was rejected by the Supreme court of India on 12 April 2013. Finally Death penalty of Devinderpal Singh Bhullar commuted to life imprisonment by the Supreme Court on 31 March 2014 on the ground of inordinate delay on part of President to decide their mercy pleas.

==Protection==
He was earlier provided with Z+ security

<doc id="1142018" wikidata="Q961258" url="?curid=1142018" title="Outside (David Bowie album)">
<text>Outside (stylised as 1. Outside and subtitled The Nathan Adler Diaries: A Hyper-cycle) is the twentieth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 25 September 1995 through Virgin Records in the United States and Arista Records, BMG and RCA Records in other territories. Reuniting Bowie with the musician Brian Eno following the late 1970s Berlin Trilogy, the two were inspired by concepts &quot;outside&quot; the mainstream, such as various outsider and performance artists. Recorded throughout 1994, the experimental sessions saw Bowie conceive a world where &quot;art crimes&quot;, such as murder, pervade society. The resulting &quot;Leon&quot; project initially faced resistance from labels due to its uncommercial nature. The project&#x27;s bootlegging led to additional sessions in 1995 to revise the concept and record more commercial material, inspired by a diary Bowie wrote for &quot;Q&quot; magazine.

Influenced by the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, the nonlinear narrative of &quot;Outside&quot; concerns the residents of the fictional Oxford Town, New Jersey, and follows the detective Nathan Adler as he investigates the murder of a 14-year-old girl. The tracks show perspectives of specific characters, while spoken word between-song segues convey more character ideals; the story and Adler&#x27;s diary entries were presented in the album&#x27;s CD booklet. Musically, &quot;Outside&quot; displays styles from art rock, industrial rock and jazz, to electronica and ambient. The album cover is a self-portrait of Bowie.

Released at the height of Britpop in the UK, &quot;Outside&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. While most praised the music, others found the concept pretentious and hard to follow. Nevertheless, many considered it Bowie&#x27;s finest record since 1980&#x27;s &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;. &quot;Outside&quot; peaked at number 8 in the UK and number 21 in the US. The lead single, &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot;, performed poorly but the following singles, &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; and a remix of &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; featuring Pet Shop Boys, performed well in the UK.

Bowie supported the album through the Outside Tour, but was criticised for not playing older hits. Multiple planned sequels to &quot;Outside&quot; never came to fruition, leaving the album&#x27;s story on a cliffhanger. Instead, Bowie used musical ideas from the album and tour for his next record, &quot;Earthling&quot; (1997). Retrospectively, &quot;Outside&quot; has received more positive assessments, with most continuing to praise the music but criticising the story and length. The album was reissued in 2003 and remastered in 2021 as part of the box set &quot;Brilliant Adventure (1992–2001)&quot;.

==Background and inspiration==
David Bowie formalised his marriage to the model Iman in a June 1992 ceremony that featured numerous celebrity guests, including the multi-instrumentalist Brian Eno, whom Bowie previously worked with on his late-1970s Berlin Trilogy. Primarily known for his work in the ambient genre at that time, by 1992, Eno was a highly respected producer, working with bands such as U2 on &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; (1991). The BBC&#x27;s radio presenter John Peel commented: &quot;He&#x27;s one of those people...who has drifted into a kind of elder statesman media role where people take everything he says terribly seriously.&quot; At the wedding, Eno expressed interest in working with Bowie again after he gave him a tape that showcased the styles Bowie would explore on his then-upcoming album &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; (1993). After Eno listened to Bowie&#x27;s &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; (1993), the two agreed to collaborate.

Bowie and Eno prepared for the new project in late 1993, which included sending each other ideas. The former&#x27;s Tin Machine bandmate Reeves Gabrels recalled that one was the equivalent of &quot;a mathematical problem&quot;. According to the author Paul Trynka, the ideas formed &quot;harked back&quot; to Bowie&#x27;s musical findings during his first trip to America in early 1971. Looking for inspiration, the pair visited the Gugging psychiatric hospital near Vienna, Austria, in January 1994, which contained a wing whose patients were well-known for their &quot;outsider art&quot;. Bowie later told &quot;Interview&quot; magazine: &quot;Some of them don&#x27;t even do [their art] as an expression of themselves; they do it because their work is them.&quot; The experience gave the upcoming album its title.

Bowie also found captivation with the Minotaur, a mythical figure from classical antiquity. He painted the figure throughout the early 1990s and, after seeing a &quot;New York Times&quot; article discussing it, incorporated it as a motif for &quot;Outside&quot;. By 1994, Bowie&#x27;s interest in contemporary art grew to the point where he joined the editorial board of &quot;Modern Painters&quot; magazine. His interest in performance artists such as Rudolf Schwarzkogler, Ron Athey, Chris Burden, and Damien Hirst all influenced the new album&#x27;s concept. Regarding the concept of death as art, Bowie told &quot;Vox&quot; magazine:

==Recording and production==

=== Initial sessions ===

Recording for &quot;Outside&quot; began in March 1994 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. Production was handled by Bowie, Eno and David Richards, the co-producer of &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;. Bowie and Eno were adamant about creating something different from the Berlin albums. The latter explained: &quot;We don&#x27;t want to make another record of a bunch of songs. There&#x27;s got to be a bigger landscape in play than that.&quot; Returning Bowie collaborators included Gabrels on guitar, Erdal Kızılçay on bass, and Mike Garson on piano. Also returning from &quot;Black Tie&quot; was Soul Asylum drummer Sterling Campbell, whom Bowie described as &quot;spontaneous and extremely inventive. [He] plays a song differently every time; there are different shades of his teacher, Dennis Davis.&quot; 

Departing from the process of Bowie&#x27;s most recent works, the majority of the tracks were composed on the spot in the studio; some were entirely improvised. During the sessions, Bowie and Eno used experimental techniques previously utilised during the Berlin Trilogy, such as the latter&#x27;s Oblique Strategies cards – &quot;part-fortune cookie, part-&quot;Monopoly&quot; &#x27;Chance&#x27; cards&quot; intended to spark creative ideas. Each one contained a written character, such as &quot;You are the disgruntled member of a South African rock band. Play the notes that were suppressed.&quot; Bowie elaborated that the cards set the tone for each day, taking the music into &quot;obscure&quot; directions: &quot;And it would very rarely lapse into the cliché.&quot; Eno stated that this was done as a way for the musicians to &quot;free you from being yourself&quot;. Garson and Gabrels responded favourably to the cards, but Kızılçay was opposed at first, finding them confusing and useless. He later complained about Eno&#x27;s methods to the biographer Marc Spitz, stating &quot;he cannot even play four bars...[nor] play two harmonies together. [...] I don&#x27;t know how he became so famous.&quot;

Bowie primarily painted during the sessions. According to Eno, he &quot;almost sat out on the first few days of that record. [...] We were creating musical situations and occasionally he would join in if it became interesting.&quot; In his diary entry dated 3 March 1994, Bowie wrote that he was happy with the current musical direction and had plans to remake the &quot;Buddha&quot; track &quot;Dead Against It&quot;, although this never came to fruition. To compose the lyrics, Bowie ran words through an Apple Macintosh program, which mirrored the William S. Burroughs-inspired cut-up technique he had previously used for albums such as &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974). He explained: &quot;I used bits of poems and articles out of magazines and newspapers, and I retyped them out and put them into the computer...it spews it all back out again, and I make of it what I will.&quot; Each musician received their own corner of the studio, which Trynka states contributed to the overall arrangement &quot;as an art happening&quot;. Discussing the studio atmosphere, Garson told biographer David Buckley: &quot;It was one of the most creative environments I have ever been in. We would just start playing. There was no key given, no tonal centre, no form, no nothing.&quot; The sessions were also filmed by a camera crew; Garson commented that &quot;[the crew] knew it was special on some level.&quot;

The backing tracks were completed in 10 days, while overdubs continued on and off until November 1994. Roughly 25 to 30 hours of material was recorded, which was initially edited down to two CDs worth of content: an &quot;improvised opera&quot; titled &quot;Leon&quot;. The material was mixed at Westside Studios in London. Eno initially wanted to release the work with black cover artwork and no name attached. Gabrels elaborated: &quot;Let it leak that it was David Bowie but put it out as a completely separate entity, like Prince&#x27;s &quot;The Black Album&quot; [1994]. Use it as a work of art and lapse something that creates interest for the next project.&quot; According to the biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary, the contents were bootlegged and resulted in Bowie&#x27;s dismissal of the &quot;Leon&quot; concept. Gabrels commented on his website in 2003 that &quot;Leon&quot; &quot;would have been a very serious musical statement, and maybe pissed off more people than Tin Machine&quot;.

===Later sessions===
Bowie initially faced opposition from record labels due to the uncommercial nature of the &quot;Leon&quot; recordings. Gabrels told Buckley: &quot;It was never said to me that it had been rejected for want of commercial material. I just thought the decision was made that [&quot;Leon&quot;] would have been insane to put out from a commercial point of view…and that we needed to rerecord some more songs.&quot; Bowie elected to record some more conventional tracks, for which sessions took place at the Hit Factory in New York City from January to February 1995. Songs recorded in New York included &quot;Outside&quot;, &quot;Thru These Architects Eyes&quot;, &quot;We Prick You&quot;, &quot;I Have Not Been to Oxford Town&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot;, a rerecording of the &quot;Buddha&quot; track &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot;, and reworkings of &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Deranged&quot;. 

New personnel additions included the guitarist Carlos Alomar, Bowie&#x27;s former bandleader who was fired following the 1987 Glass Spider Tour; Tin Machine contributor Kevin Armstrong on &quot;Thru These Architects Eyes&quot;; and the jazz drummer Joey Baron, whom Bowie felt was &quot;so steady&quot; that &quot;metronomes shake in fear&quot;. Armstrong&#x27;s song &quot;Now&quot;, first attempted by Tin Machine during the sessions for their 1989 debut album, was adapted into the title track. Armstrong recorded his contributions at Westside.

==Concept and story==

The concept of &quot;Outside&quot; originated on 12 March 1994, during what Bowie called a &quot;blindingly orgiastic&quot; recording session. As the band improvised, he conceived numerous characters on the spot, playing each out &quot;for maybe five minutes at a time&quot;. He later revealed that &quot;almost the entire genesis for [&quot;Outside&quot;] is contained in those three and a half hours&quot;. In what Bowie labelled a &quot;non-linear Gothic drama hyper-cycle&quot;, he developed a world where &quot;art crimes&quot;, which Jason Draper of &quot;Dig!&quot; magazine described as &quot;murder and mutilation for public consumption&quot;, pervade society, and &quot;concept muggings&quot; merit their own police division funded by the &quot;Arts Protectorate of London&quot;.

In late 1994, &quot;Q&quot; magazine asked Bowie to write a diary for 10 days as a way to contribute to their 100th issue. Fearing the diary would be uninteresting if presented as a pure day-by-day account, he revised the &quot;Leon&quot; concept and wrote what became the basis for &quot;Outside&quot;: &quot;The Diary of Nathan Adler or the Art-Ritual Murder of Baby Grace Belew&quot;. The same story, with mild revisions, appeared in the album&#x27;s CD booklet. According to Gabrels, Bowie &quot;looked into [the &quot;Leon&quot; concept] further and revised and rewrote. [...] The order and plot were imposed/invented...after the fact.&quot; While characters lacked motivations on &quot;Leon&quot;, they now had distinct personalities and motives on &quot;Outside&quot;, similar to the board game &quot;Cluedo&quot;. Taking influences from the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot; concerns the fictional Oxford Town, New Jersey, and its inhabitants, including: a detective named Nathan Adler; a jeweler named Ramona A. Stone; a 14-year-old girl named Baby Grace Blue; a 78-year-old loner named Algeria Touchshriek; a mixed-race &quot;Outsider&quot; named Leon Blank; Paddy, one of Adler&#x27;s informants; and a shadowy figure named the Artist/Minotaur. Bowie, who portrayed all the characters, stated that he based all of them on himself, which AllMusic&#x27;s Roch Parisien found &quot;therefore, a component of all the previous personas Bowie has enacted over the years.&quot;
The story of &quot;Outside&quot; takes place over two decades, between 1977 and 1999, and is presented in a nonlinear narrative. The album&#x27;s CD booklet contained Adler&#x27;s diary entries alongside song lyrics which were sometimes distorted and unreadable. The album also invokes several spoken word segments as between-song segues, which provide more insight into the story and characters&#x27; thoughts. Parisien considered the segues reminiscent of the &quot;Cockney campiness&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s 1960s tracks &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot; and &quot;The Laughing Gnome&quot;. Described by some as a concept album, &quot;Music Week&quot; Paul Gorman found the use of narrative on &quot;Outside&quot; a callback to &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; (1972) and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;. Bowie described Adler, the protagonist, as an individual who uses nostalgia to look back on simpler times: &quot;He&#x27;s really rather despondent that things are broken into this fragmented chaotic kind of state.&quot; O&#x27;Leary considers the character &quot;more terse&quot; on &quot;Outside&quot; than in &quot;Leon&quot;. Adler&#x27;s perspective is shown in &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot; and two segues. Stone, the villain, begins as a punk rock &quot;no-future priestess&quot; and ends as a &quot;good time drone&quot; running a jewelry store. Bowie manipulated his own voice using various synthesisers to portray her. Her point of view is given in a segue and &quot;I Am with Name&quot;.

The dismembered body of Baby Grace Blue is found in a town museum. The scene is described in detail in the CD booklet while on the album, the girl&#x27;s last words appear in a cassette tape (&quot;Segue – Baby Grace (A Horrid Cassette)&quot;). Bowie stated that Grace&#x27;s voice meant the most to him as he based it on a close friend who was struggling with a relationship at the time. After the body is found, Adler&#x27;s primary goal is to find the murderer. The character of Algeria Touchshriek &quot;deals in art-drugs and DNA prints&quot;. Based on numerous characters from Bowie&#x27;s 1960s songs, Touchshriek is described in a segue as walking near the museum where the body was found and that he &quot;knew Leon once&quot;. Blank, one of Stone&#x27;s former lovers, is an outsider artist and murder suspect. Bowie characterised him as a blend of musician Tricky and painter Jean-Michel Basquiat. Throughout the album, he is primarily viewed through the eyes of others (&quot;Leon Takes Us Outside&quot;, &quot;The Motel&quot; and &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot;), but is given his own perspective on &quot;I Have Not Been to Oxford Town&quot;, where he denies his involvement with the killings; Blank is also ascribed to &quot;Thru&#x27; These Architects Eyes&quot;, although the track has little to do with the &quot;Outside&quot; narrative. The Artist/Minotaur is a figure who &quot;lurks behind the art-ritual murder&quot; at the narrative&#x27;s centre. His point of view is given during &quot;The Voyeur of Utter Destruction (as Beauty)&quot;, &quot;Wishful Beginnings&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Deranged&quot;. The residents of Oxford Town convey thoughts on &quot;A Small Plot of Land&quot;, while &quot;We Prick You&quot; concerns the ideals of the Members of the Court of Justice.

==Musical styles==

&quot;Outside&quot; contains a wide variety of musical styles, including rock, jazz, electronica, industrial rock and ambient. Writers for &quot;The Independent&quot; and BBC News retrospectively categorised it as art rock and industrial rock. Adam Trainer of &quot;PopMatters&quot; similarly described the music as &quot;chiefly industrial and trip hop, as filtered through the lens of art rock&quot;. He further argued that the album&#x27;s &quot;soundscapes&quot; showcased &quot;the rock/electronic hybridity&quot; that would be labeled by music analysts and the mainstream as post-rock. The biographer Christopher Sandford finds the music evocative of the &quot;faux-jazz stylings&quot; found on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (1973), while in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, Barry Walters noted the presence of progressive rock. Other commentators, including Nick DeRiso of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, recognised styles of techno, grunge and industrial over &quot;the electronic soundbeds&quot; that exemplified the Berlin Trilogy. Other styles recognised by Bowie&#x27;s biographers include dark ambient (&quot;Leon Takes Us Outside&quot;), acid jazz (&quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot;), funk (&quot;I Have Not Been to Oxford Town&quot;, &quot;The Voyeur of Utter Destruction (as Beauty)&quot;), avant-garde jazz and classical (&quot;The Motel&quot;, &quot;A Small Plot of Land&quot;), and conventional pop (&quot;I Have Not Been to Oxford Town&quot;, &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot;). Certain tracks, such as &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Deranged&quot; and &quot;We Prick You&quot;, combine elements of jungle and drum and bass, genres Bowie fully explored on his next studio album, &quot;Earthling&quot; (1997).

Buckley says the album&#x27;s overall sound is &quot;dense and textural, underpinned by a booming rhythm section&quot;. Writing for &quot;Rock and Roll Globe&quot;, Lee Zimmerman stated: &quot;The music flow[s] in a continuous surge of sound and expression, a forward thrust that left little room for melody, but shared an intriguing atmospheric ambiance instead.&quot; The author James E. Perone finds many tracks act as &quot;mood pieces&quot; for the entire album rather than as standalone tracks. According to the writer Alan Franks: &quot;The songs have a slow, careful build into the pay-off line but they&#x27;re absolutely not written as pop songs and they&#x27;re not particularly written as rock songs. It&#x27;s almost like what Jacques Brel would be going now if he&#x27;d gone heavy.&quot; Biographers have also compared certain sounds on &quot;Outside&quot; to Bowie&#x27;s previous albums, such as &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;, &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979), &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; (1980), and &quot;Tonight&quot; (1984). Nicholas Pegg characterises the segues&#x27; musical styles as mostly ambient, with guitar, piano and synthesiser backings. Trainer commented that they &quot;speak to the role of the &quot;Leon&quot; suites in the development of &quot;Outside&quot;&quot;.

The first two tracks, &quot;Leon Takes Us Outside&quot; and the title track, musically set the stage for the rest of the album. &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot; contains an almost atonal groove that Pegg calls &quot;a slab of industrial techno-rock&quot; over an &quot;eccentric jazz-piano figure&quot;. Continuing the jazz flavour is &quot;A Small Plot of Land&quot;, which builds to a climax to become, in Pegg&#x27;s words, one of the album&#x27;s &quot;more challenging tracks&quot;. &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot;, which was developed from an instrumental written by Gabrels titled &quot;Moondust&quot;, is an industrial track that Pegg calls &quot;a hardcore maelstrom of sci-fi noise, hypnotic high-speed drumming and an insistent, speaker-hopping four-note guitar riff&quot;. Spitz names it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most convincing rocker&quot; since &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; (1974). 

&quot;The Motel&quot;, described by Pegg as the album&#x27;s centrepiece, is compared by Buckley to the Walker Brothers&#x27; &quot;The Electrician&quot; (1978), while Perone compares &quot;I Have Not Been to Oxford Town&quot; to Queen&#x27;s &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (1977). &quot;No Control&quot; brings a darker tone to the album, featuring a &quot;hard-edged synth bassline&quot;. Later on, &quot;I Am with Name&quot; reprises the &quot;atmospherics&quot; of the album&#x27;s opening. &quot;Wishful Beginnings&quot; evokes &quot;a mysterious, abstract melody over slowly building, layered, synthesized electronic sounds&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Deranged&quot; conveys similar musical styles that pervade the rest of the album. Compared to the original version on &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;, the remake of &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; contains a more lush arrangement influenced by U2&#x27;s Eno co-produced &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; (1987). Pegg writes that it resolves the album&#x27;s &quot;angst and black comedy&quot; with a &quot;soothing slice of conventional pop&quot;. On the other hand, Trainer considered it an &quot;odd&quot; way to end the album, writing that it was &quot;clearly an attempt to...inject a sense of calm whilst perpetuating the noir-ish air of mystery&quot;.

==&quot;Leon&quot; recordings==
Described by Gabrels as a &quot;three-hour improvised opus&quot;, the &quot;Leon&quot; recordings are available through bootlegs in three separate &quot;suites&quot;, each between 22 and 27 minutes long. A fully mixed 70-minute reel was also released by a private collector in 2003. According to Pegg, the released piece is significantly more uncommercial than the final &quot;Outside&quot; album, featuring a slew of &quot;ambient soundscapes&quot; and longer versions of the album&#x27;s segues. It also features numerous repetitive phrases and loops amongst interplay between the musicians. Trainer found the recordings to be &quot;underdeveloped&quot; compared to &quot;Outside&quot;, describing them more as &quot;loose jams&quot; typified by &quot;plodding beats and unformed repetitive structures that lack the dynamics [the finished &quot;Outside&quot; album] would yield&quot;.

The first suite is divided into three movements. The opening ten-minute number &quot;I Am with Name&quot; contains longer and more obscene variations of the Stone and first Adler segues. O&#x27;Leary notes that more voices appear on &quot;Leon&quot; than &quot;Outside&quot;, highlighting a character who &quot;sounds as if rats are climbing over his body&quot; four minutes into the suite. A more melodic five-minute movement titled &quot;We&#x27;ll Creep Together&quot; follows, featuring Garson&#x27;s &quot;rippling&quot; piano over a slew of sound effects such as gunshot noises. &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Chrome&quot; follows, displaying a repeating phrase throughout and contains more narration from Adler over, in Pegg&#x27;s words, a &quot;prowling, catchy riff&quot;, before the lyrics delve into topics previously explored on &quot;Low&quot; (1977).

The second suite, titled &quot;The Enemy Is Fragile&quot;, is categorised by O&#x27;Leary as the centrepiece of &quot;Leon&quot;. It features patterns similar to &quot;A Small Plot of Land&quot;, along with funk playing from the backing musicians, numerous sound effects and narration from Adler and Stone. Some of the narration reflects themes present in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991). The piece builds to a climax with various repeated phrases before ending with a drum fill. The rest of the suite consists of the first appearance of the Artist/Minotaur and various synthesisers, with additional piano and saxophone. One section, titled &quot;Nothing to Be Desired&quot;, was issued as a bonus track on &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot; CD single, and remains the only material from &quot;Leon&quot; that was officially released. Following &quot;Nothing to Be Desired&quot; is lengthy variations of the &quot;Baby Grace&quot; and &quot;Algeria Touchshriek&quot; segues.

The third and final suite, titled &quot;Leon Takes Us Outside&quot;, further develops the character of Blank; the opening section became the opening to &quot;Outside&quot;. It begins as a jazzy instrumental with guitar, piano and synthesisers, with more repetitive phrases and narration from Adler and Stone; one sequence fully conveys Adler&#x27;s story. According to O&#x27;Leary, the suite closes with feedback and a drum fill. Shortly after the release of &quot;Outside&quot;, Bowie expressed interest in making the &quot;Leon&quot; material officially available, although the idea never came to fruition.

==Release==

Without a label for the third time in three years, &quot;Outside&quot;″s release was delayed while Bowie attempted to find an American distributor, later commenting, &quot;Nobody would take &quot;Outside&quot; when we first recorded it.&quot; In June 1995, Bowie signed a contract with Virgin America Records, telling &quot;Music Connection&quot; in September that the label were &quot;extremely supportive&quot; regarding the &quot;Outside&quot; concept and allowed Bowie full creative control in the studio. Additionally, Virgin acquired the rights to Bowie&#x27;s work from &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983) to &quot;Tin Machine&quot;, reissuing them throughout the rest of the year with bonus tracks. In Britain, Bowie entered a new deal with BMG, who issued &quot;Black Tie&quot; and &quot;Buddha&quot; in the country. BMG were now affiliated with RCA Records, Bowie&#x27;s label throughout the 1970s and whom he had departed in 1982.

&quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot; was released as the lead single on 11 September 1995. It was accompanied by a music video directed by Samuel Bayer that was initially banned from MTV due to provocative imagery. Commercially, the single performed poorly, peaking at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart and number 92 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Pegg and Trynka state that Bowie desired to display a video of &quot;artistic merit&quot; rather than for chart appeal.

&quot;Outside&quot;, stylised as &quot;1. Outside – The Nathan Adler Diaries: A Hyper-cycle&quot;, was released on 25 September 1995 by Virgin America in the US and Arista, BMG and RCA in other territories on LP and CD formats. The CD release was the full 75-minute album, while the LP release was an abridged version titled &quot;Excerpts From 1. Outside&quot;, which featured shortened edits of &quot;Leon Takes Us Outside&quot; and &quot;The Motel&quot; and removed the tracks &quot;No Control&quot;, &quot;Wishful Beginnings&quot;, &quot;Thru&#x27; These Architects Eyes&quot;, &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot;, along with multiple segues. The Japanese CD release included the outtake &quot;Get Real&quot;. The cover artwork is a 1995 painting on canvas by Bowie himself called &quot;Head of DB&quot;. Commercially, &quot;Outside&quot; peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart and number 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; Bowie&#x27;s profile in America had been raised through the popularity of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; version of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, as well as artists who cited Bowie&#x27;s influence such as Nine Inch Nails, the Smashing Pumpkins and Marilyn Manson. Due to advance orders, &quot;Outside&quot; became Bowie&#x27;s fastest-selling album since &quot;Tonight&quot;.
Bowie promoted &quot;Outside&quot; through various television appearances. &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; was issued as a double A-side single with a new recording of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; mixed by Eno on 20 November 1995. It reached number 39 in the UK and was supported by a music video, again directed by Bayer. Bowie performed the song at the European MTV Awards the same month. &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; was released as the third and final single on 19 February 1996 in a new remix featuring the English duo Pet Shop Boys. The idea originated from Neil Tennant, who added lines referencing Major Tom from &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969). Pet Shop Boys subsequently appeared in the song&#x27;s video, directed by longtime Bowie director David Mallet, and performed the song with Bowie at the Brit Awards in February and on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in March. The single itself performed well commercially, peaking at number 12 in the UK. The remix later replaced &quot;Wishful Beginnings&quot; on the March 1996 European reissue of &quot;Outside&quot; titled &quot;1. Outside Version 2&quot;.

===&quot;Art-Crime&quot; Comic===
Anticipating that the narrative of the album might be inaccessible to fans when it was released, one of the record executives in Mexico, Arturo López Gavito, commissioned a comic to clarify the story. The comic, a one-off called &quot;Art-Crime&quot;, was created by two young illustrators, Victor &quot;Pico&quot; Covarrubias and Jotavé (Jazmin Velasco-Moore). It was given away with the CD.

===Context===
In 1995, the UK music scene was dominated by Britpop bands such as Suede, Blur, Pulp and Oasis, all of whom were indebted to Bowie&#x27;s 1970s works. In his book &quot;The Last Party&quot;, the British journalist John Harris states, &quot;David Bowie was a far greater influence on Britpop than any artist of the &#x27;60s.&quot; Pegg writes that while older artists such as Paul Weller and Adam Ant were releasing successful Britpop records in 1995, Bowie stood in tangent with industrial rock artists like Nine Inch Nails and techno artists such as Tricky, Goldie and the Chemical Brothers. Buckley says that the only record that was stylistically similar to &quot;Outside&quot; at the time was Scott Walker&#x27;s &quot;Tilt&quot;, released four months prior.

Further analysing the cultural landscape beyond music at that time, Pegg states that &quot;Outside&quot; arrived alongside the &quot;glamorous cruelty&quot; of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994); it &quot;inhabited the trashy cyberpunk &quot;milieu&quot;&quot; of films such as &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, &quot;Tank Girl&quot; and &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (all 1995); and exhibited elements of &quot;extraterrestrial conspiracy theories&quot; brought to the forefront on television by &quot;The X-Files&quot;. &quot;Outside&quot; was also one of the first albums in the age of the internet and showcased the same &quot;pre-millennial angst&quot; as Pulp&#x27;s late 1995 single &quot;Disco 2000&quot;. Tracks from &quot;Outside&quot; were also used in entertainment. &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot; was played over the end credits of &quot;Seven&quot; (1995), while &quot;A Small Plot of Land&quot; was the theme song for the 1996 BBC miniseries &quot;A History of British Art&quot;. Pegg concludes: &quot;For the first time since [1980&#x27;s] &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, Bowie had released an album that accessed the zeitgeist at all levels.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Critical reviews of &quot;Outside&quot; were mixed on release. While the majority praised the music as challenging, many felt the overarching concept was hard to follow, with some finding it &quot;pretentious&quot;. Among positive reviews, critics considered &quot;Outside&quot; Bowie&#x27;s best record since &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;. A writer for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine elaborated: &quot;[The] edifice of sounds, cultures, rhythms, samples and textures, with randomised lyrics that don&#x27;t much tell a story as create word-moods, regards the open-minded listener with Bowie&#x27;s best album for 15 years.&quot; In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Charles Shaar Murray welcomed &quot;an excellent David Bowie album, a genuine creative rebirth. Threatening and murky... His gift for the charismatically disturbing seems to have reasserted itself.&quot; Later on in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, Murray considered it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; comeback album, praising the music as a callback to the Berlin Trilogy and concluded: &quot;[It&#x27;s] a mad, bad, dangerous album – by turns, chilling, pretty, ugly, scary, gripping and vastly intriguing.&quot;

Some reviewers found the music among Bowie&#x27;s most innovative; a writer for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; announced that Bowie &quot;is poised to be a healthy influence once more on a fifth generation of glamorous chameleons.&quot; An &quot;NME&quot; reviewer stated, &quot;Bowie&#x27;s scalpel is certainly closer to the pulse than for years.&quot; Other publications, such as &quot;Today&quot;, considered Bowie&#x27;s vocal performances throughout the record some of his finest. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; appreciated the lyrics as &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;sly&quot;, especially on &quot;I Have Not Been to Oxford Town&quot; and &quot;A Small Plot of Land&quot;. He mostly criticised the spoken segues, arguing that they &quot;damn near sink the record&quot;. Paul Verna of &quot;Billboard&quot; found the album &quot;stumbles&quot; on the segues, stating that they &quot;advance the plotline but hold little musical interest&quot;. They argued that if listeners &quot;cherry-pick&quot; throughout, &quot;Outside&quot; &quot;stands a chance of reestablishing Bowie as a vital artist&quot;.

Other reviewers expressed more mixed assessments. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Browne found the majority of the record sounding like &quot;fodder&quot; and felt that it would benefit from a visual aid, such as through tour performances. Sandy Masuo of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; enjoyed certain tracks but felt overall, Bowie was experimenting in genres that, by 1995, were being made more successfully by other artists. &quot;Select&quot; magazine&#x27;s Gareth Grundy also found a lack of musical innovation, albeit highlighting &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot; and &quot;We Prick You&quot; as standouts. 

Some reviewers believed the album would appeal to Bowie&#x27;s longtime fans, but displease newer ones. &quot;Q&quot;″s Tom Doyle said: &quot;Regulars might feel short-changed on the tune front and those legions who came in on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; will most certainly be left completely and utterly bewildered. Perhaps, though, that&#x27;s entirely the point.&quot; The album also attracted negative responses. Grundy, in particular, called &quot;Outside&quot; &quot;the daftest thing Bowie&#x27;s done&quot; since the Glass Spider Tour. &quot;Ikon&quot;″s Taylor Parkes complained that &quot;Bowie&#x27;s desperate desire to be considered &#x27;highbrow&#x27; has snuffed out any potential of accidental alchemy&quot; and promptly dismissed the record as a &quot;sorry sack of shit... facile, confused and immature... quite simply, rubbish.&quot;

==Tour==
In an interview with &quot;Music Week&quot; in early 1995, Bowie expressed no interest in performing the &quot;Outside&quot; material live, calling it &quot;far too ambitious a project&quot;. Nevertheless, after enduring pressure from Virgin, Bowie rescinded and began rehearsals to tour America in August 1995, thereafter extending the number of dates by early September and adding a European leg. The tour&#x27;s lineup included Gabrels, Garson and Alomar, with new additions including the vocalist George Simms from the 1983 Serious Moonlight Tour, the musical director Peter Schwartz, the drummer Zachary Alford and the bassist Gail Ann Dorsey, both of whom continued to work with Bowie frequently in subsequent years. The Outside Tour commenced on 14 September.

Nine Inch Nails opened the American shows. The frontman Trent Reznor was intimidated by the idea at first but graciously accepted. The setlists mostly consisted of the &quot;Outside&quot; material and more unknown tracks from Bowie&#x27;s career, along with reworkings of older tracks to fit the new album&#x27;s styles. Towards the end of the opening sets, Bowie joined Nine Inch Nails on stage, where the two artists played songs from their own catalogues such as &quot;Subterraneans&quot; (1977) and &quot;Hurt&quot; (1994), respectively. The fusion of the two artists was met with resistance from both artists&#x27; fanbases. &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Chris Jones reported that during one performance, Bowie was pelted with debris from the confused crowd. The American leg concluded at the end of October. The tour&#x27;s partnership between Bowie and Reznor facilitated the latter&#x27;s undertaking of numerous &quot;Outside&quot; and &quot;Earthling&quot; remixes, as well as his appearance in the music video for &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; (1997).

The European leg commenced in November 1995 with shows at the Wembley Arena in London, with Morrissey as the opening act. Tensions between Bowie and Morrissey rose, leading the latter to depart shortly into the tour&#x27;s leg; the remaining dates were opened by various local bands. The tour concluded on 20 February 1996. The UK shows, particularly Morrissey&#x27;s appearances, were generally panned by concert reviewers. Throughout the tour, many criticised Bowie&#x27;s decision not to sing well-known hits, to which he replied: &quot;If they didn&#x27;t know that I wasn&#x27;t going to be [playing the hits], they must have been living under a rock.&quot; Despite the tour&#x27;s poor reception from contemporary reviewers, Pegg states that it showcased Bowie&#x27;s musical progression and was his finest tour in 20 years. Recordings from the tour were later released in 2020 on the live albums &quot;Ouvrez le Chien (Live Dallas 95)&quot; and &quot;No Trendy Réchauffé (Live Birmingham 95)&quot;, as part of the series &quot;Brilliant Live Adventures&quot; (2020–2021).

==Legacy==
===Proposed sequels===
The story of &quot;Outside&quot; ends on a cliffhanger, with a &quot;to be continued...&quot; tagline in the CD booklet. Bowie initially envisioned the album as the first in a series of records that would be released each year until the end of the millennium. He stated, &quot;This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance, by a narrative device, to chronicle the final five years of the millennium. The over-ambitious intention is to carry this through to the year 2000.&quot; He further explained to &quot;Ikon&quot;:

Having recorded hours of extra material during the sessions, he considered releasing a companion album to &quot;Outside&quot; before revealing in early 1997 that the follow-up would be called &quot;2. Contamination&quot;, and had sketched out characters for the project (including some &quot;17th-century people&quot;). He also mentioned the possibility of releasing an album called &quot;Inside&quot; which would have been a making-of about &quot;Outside&quot;: &quot;Our working method [will be] detailed on it, a couple of jams and more of those voices.&quot; However, none of these projects came to fruition. Following his experience on the Outside Tour, Bowie took musical ideas and themes from &quot;Outside&quot; and utilised them to create &quot;Earthling&quot;.

In 2016, one day after Bowie&#x27;s death, Eno recalled: &quot;About a year ago we started talking about &quot;Outside&quot;—the last album we worked on together. We both liked that album a lot and felt that it had fallen through the cracks. We talked about revisiting it, taking it somewhere new. I was looking forward to that.&quot;

===Retrospective assessments===

Following Bowie&#x27;s death, the editors of &quot;Prog&quot; magazine stated that &quot;Outside&quot; would be due for a re-evaluation as one of his finest works. Like on its original release, later reviewers continue praising the music as challenging, innovative and among his finest, but find the story self-indulgent. Perone argues that its nonlinear narrative makes for a hard-to-follow listening experience, and one where certain tracks that are inherently tied to the album&#x27;s theme—particularly the segues—prove ineffective as standalone tracks. 

In the decades following its release, Trynka contends that the rise of iTunes and nonlinear listening patterns through shuffling have made reactions to &quot;Outside&quot; more positive, with Garson later calling it a career highlight. Parisien later argued: &quot;The effort required to adequately &#x27;process&#x27; [the album] pays off in a richly voyeuristic experience where Bowie once again reflects fringe culture onto the mainstream and forces us to consider that the differences are not so great.&quot; Zimmerman stated that beyond the tracklisting itself, the album &quot;offered little in the way of cohesive melodies&quot;. Some also found the production dated, with Spitz calling it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most of-its-time work since his late-sixties hippie folk material&quot;.

Several have criticised &quot;Outside&quot; as overlong; at nearly 75 minutes, it is Bowie&#x27;s longest studio album. At the time, Bowie remarked that it was &quot;extremely long by most current CD standards&quot; and that accessibility was not a top priority when making it. However, he and Eno later regretted its long duration, with the former stating in 1997, &quot;There&#x27;s too much on it. I really should have made it two CDs.&quot; Sandford agrees, stating that it could have used more polishing and trimming. Furthermore, Perone finds that it &quot;really begs to be listened to [in one] sitting&quot;, while Trainer stated the second half drags. 

Reviewing &quot;Outside&quot; on its 25th anniversary, Trainer said it stands out as &quot;an odd, infuriatingly dense, and often brilliant record from (and of) an artist sho [&quot;sic&quot;], having been one of popular music&#x27;s leading lights in the 70s, was newly inspired&quot;. He criticised the production as dated and concept as too underdeveloped to have a long-lasting impact, but noted that its best tracks rank among Bowie&#x27;s greatest. He concluded that the record &quot;remains a compelling, complicated, frustrating and flawed listen&quot;, and due to its incomplete state, he argued that fans can finish it on their own. Pegg finds &quot;Outside&quot; was made for fans of &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;, &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Lodger&quot; rather than &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Describing it as &quot;a triumphantly queasy, deliciously unpleasant album&quot;, he concludes: &quot;&quot;Outside&quot; remains as brilliant and intriguingly inconclusive as it was surely always supposed to be.&quot;

In a 2016 retrospective ranking all of Bowie&#x27;s 26 studio albums from worst to best, Bryan Wawzenek of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;Outside&quot; at number 19, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s a solid framework for Bowie and Eno to get creative within – the backgrounds are reliably intriguing, if not always satisfying.&quot; Two years later, the writers of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Outside&quot; number seven in a similar list, above acclaimed records such as &quot;Blackstar&quot; (2016) and &quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976), stating that the album &quot;succeeded because Bowie bought in completely to its concept and strangeness&quot;. In 2024, the editors of &quot;Uncut&quot; ranked the album at number 112 in their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of the 1990s&quot;, calling it a &quot;boldly experimental&quot; album that eschewed Bowie&#x27;s earlier styles and adding that &quot;amid the avant-gumshoe business, Mike Garson and other old pals created engrossing drama.&quot;

===Reissues===
In 2003, Columbia Records reissued &quot;Outside&quot; on CD in the UK, with another reissue following a year later that contained bonus tracks, including 14 remixes and B-sides. In 2015, almost 20 years after its original release, Friday Music released the full-length album on vinyl as a double-LP set. In 2021, the album was remastered and included as part of the box set &quot;Brilliant Adventure (1992–2001)&quot;.

<text>Norman Fairclough (; born 3 April 1941) is an emeritus Professor of Linguistics at Department of Linguistics and English Language at Lancaster University. He is one of the founders of critical discourse analysis (CDA) as applied to sociolinguistics. CDA is concerned with how power is exercised through language. CDA studies discourse; in CDA this includes texts, talk, video and practices.

==Methodology of CDA==
Fairclough&#x27;s line of study, also called &quot;textually oriented discourse analysis&quot; or TODA, to distinguish it from philosophical enquires not involving the use of linguistic methodology, is specially concerned with the mutual effects of formally linguistic textual properties, sociolinguistic speech genres, and formally sociological practices. The main thrust of his analysis is that, if —according to Foucauldian theory— practices are discursively shaped and enacted, the intrinsic properties of discourse, which are linguistically analysable, are to constitute a key element of their interpretation. He is thus interested in how social practices are discursively shaped, as well as the subsequent discursive effects of social practices.

&quot;Language and Power&quot; (1989; now in a revised third edition 2014) explored the between language and social institutional practices and of &quot;wider&quot; political and social structures. In the book Fairclough developed the concept of synthetic personalisation to account for the linguistic effects providing an appearance of direct concern and contact with the individual listener in mass-crafted discourse phenomena, such as advertising, marketing, and political or media discourse. This is seen as part of a larger-scale process of technologisation of discourse, which the increasingly subtle technical developments in the field of communication that aim to bring under scientifically regulated practice semiotic fields that were formerly considered suprasegmental, such as patterns of intonation, the graphic layout of text on the page or proxemic data.

His book &quot;New Labour, New Language?&quot; looks at the rhetoric used by the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, with a particular focus on the party&#x27;s developments towards New Labour.

==Influences==
Fairclough&#x27;s theories have been influenced by Mikhail Bakhtin and Michael Halliday in linguistics and by ideology theorists such as Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault, and Pierre Bourdieu in sociology.

<text>The political groups of the European Parliament are the officially recognised parliamentary groups consisting of legislators of aligned ideologies in the European Parliament. 

The European Parliament is unique among supranational assemblies in that its members (MEPs) organise themselves into ideological groups, rather than national cleavages. Each political group is assumed to have a set of core principles, and political groups that cannot demonstrate this may be disbanded (see below).

A political group of the EP usually constitutes the formal parliamentary representation of one or two of the European political parties (Europarty), sometimes supplemented by members from other national political parties or independent politicians. In contrast to the European political parties, it is strictly forbidden for political groups to organise or finance the political campaign during the European elections since this is the exclusive responsibility of the parties. But there are other incentives for MEPs to organise in parliamentary Groups: besides the political advantages of working together with like-minded colleagues, Groups have some procedural privileges within the Parliament (such as Group spokespersons speaking first in debates, Group leaders representing the Group in the Parliament&#x27;s Conference of Presidents), and Groups receive a staff allocation and financial subsidies. Majorities in the Parliament depend on how Groups vote and what deals are negotiated among them.

==Status==
Although most of the political groups in the European Parliament correlate to a corresponding political party, there are cases where members from two political parties come together in a shared political group: for example, the European Free Alliance (half a dozen MEPs in the ninth Parliament) and the European Green Party (over 50 MEPs in the ninth Parliament) have, since 1999, felt they are stronger by working together in the European Greens–European Free Alliance Group than they would have as stand-alone groups (especially for the EFA, which would not otherwise have enough members to constitute a group). The same is true of the Renew Europe Group, most of whose members are from the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, but also includes a dozen from the small European Democratic Party. Both have also had independents and MEPs from minor parties also join their Group.

For a Group to be formally recognised in the Parliament, it must fulfil the conditions laid down in the relevant European Parliament Rule of Procedure. This lays down the minimum criteria a Group must meet to qualify as a Group. The numerical criteria are 23 MEPs (at 3.3 percent, a lower threshold than in most national parliaments) but they must come from at least one-quarter of Member States (so currently at least seven). They must also share a political affinity and submit a political declaration, setting out the purpose of the group, the values that it stands for and the main political objectives which its members intend to pursue together. The requirement of political affinity was put to the test in July 1999, when a varied group of non-attached members, ranging from the liberal Bonino List in Italy to the French National Front, tried to create a new “Technical Group”, but Parliament decided that the new Group did not, by its own admission, meet the requirement for political affinity. This decision was challenged at the CJEU, which found in Parliament&#x27;s favour.

Further questions were asked when MEPs attempted to create a far-right Group called &quot;Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty&quot; (ITS). This generated controversy and there were concerns about public funds going towards a far-right Group. Attempts to block the formation of ITS were unsuccessful, but ITS were blocked from leading positions on committees, when members from other Groups declined to vote for their candidates, despite a previous tradition of sharing such posts among members from all Groups.

These events spurred MEPs, mainly from the largest two groups, to approve a rise in the threshold for groups to its current levels, having previously been even lower. This was opposed by many MEPs, notably from smaller Groups but also from the Liberal Group, arguing that it would be detrimental to democracy, whilst supporters argued that the change made it harder for a small number of members, possibly on the extremes (including the far right), to claim public funds.

==Internal structure==
Groups may be based around a single European political party (e.g. the European People&#x27;s Party, the Party of European Socialists) or they can include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents, such as the Greens–European Free Alliance group.

Each group appoints a leader, referred to as a &quot;president&quot;, &quot;co-ordinator&quot; or &quot;chair&quot;. The chairs of each Group meet in the Conference of Presidents to decide what issues will be dealt with at the plenary session of the European Parliament. Groups can table motions for resolutions and table amendments to reports.

==Spectrum==
=== Composition of the 10th European Parliament===

=== Composition of the 9th European Parliament===

===Positions===

====Social====
EUL/NGL and G/EFA were the most left-wing groups, UEN and EDD the most right-wing, and that was mirrored in their attitudes towards taxation, homosexual equality, abortion, euthanasia and controlling migration into the EU. The groups fell into two distinct camps regarding the further development of EU authority, with UEN and EDD definitely against and the rest broadly in favour. Opinion was wider on the CFSP, with different divisions on different issues. Unsurprisingly, G/EFA was far more in favour of Green issues compared to the other groups.

====Attitude to EU tax====

Table 1 of an April 2008 discussion paper from the Centre for European Economic Research by Heinemann et al. analysed each Group&#x27;s stance on a hypothetical generalised EU tax. The results for each Group are given in the adjacent diagram with the horizontal scale scaled so that −100% = totally against and 100% = totally for. The results are also given in the table below, rescaled so that 0% = totally against, 100% = totally for.

G/EFA and PES were in favour of such a tax, IND/DEM and the Independents were definitely against, the others had no clear position.
==Analyses==
National media focus on the MEPs and national parties of their own member state, neglecting the group&#x27;s activities and poorly understanding their structure or even existence. Transnational media coverage of the groups &quot;per se&quot; is limited to those organs such as the Parliament itself, or those news media (e.g. EUObserver or theParliament.com) that specialise in the Parliament. These organs cover the groups in detail but with little overarching analysis. So although such organs make it easy to find out how a group acted on a specific vote, they provide little information on the voting patterns of a specific group. As a result, the only bodies providing analysis of the voting patterns and &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; of the groups are academics. Academics analysing the European political groups include Simon Hix (London School of Economics and Political Science), Amie Kreppel University of Florida, Abdul Noury (Free University of Brussels), Gérard Roland, (University of California, Berkeley), Gail McElroy (Trinity College Dublin, Department of Political Science), Kenneth Benoit (Trinity College Dublin – Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS)), Friedrich Heinemann, Philipp Mohl, and Steffen Osterloh (University of Mannheim – Centre for European Economic Research).

===Groups cohesion===

&quot;Cohesion&quot; is the term used to define whether a Group is united or divided amongst itself. Figure 1 of a 2002 paper from European Integration online Papers (EIoP) by Thorsten Faas analysed the Groups as they stood in 2002. 
The results for each Group are given in the adjacent diagram with the horizontal scale scaled so that 0% = totally split, 100% = totally united. The results are also given in the table below.

G/EFA, PES and ELDR were the most united groups, with EDD the most disunited.
===Proportion of female MEPs===

The March 2006 edition of &quot;Social Europe: the Journal of the European Left&quot; included a chapter called &quot;Women and Social Democratic Politics&quot; by Wendy Stokes. That chapter gave the proportion of female MEPs in each Group in the European Parliament. The results for each Group are given in the adjacent diagram. The horizontal scale denotes gender balance (0% = totally male, 100% = totally female, but no Group has a female majority, so the scale stops at 50%). The results are also given in the table below.

G/EFA, PES and ALDE were the most balanced groups in terms of gender, with IND/DEM being the most unbalanced.
===Party relations===
The Parliament does not form a government in the traditional sense and its politics have developed over consensual rather than adversarial lines as a form of consociationalism. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. Historically, the two largest parliamentary formations have been the EPP Group and the PES Group, which are affiliated to their respective European political parties, the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and the Party of European Socialists (PES). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 per cent of the seats together. The PES were the largest single party grouping up to 1999, when they were overtaken by the centre-right EPP.

In 1987 the Single European Act came into force and, under the new cooperation procedure, the Parliament needed to obtain large majorities to make the most impact. So the EPP and PES came to an agreement to cooperate in the Parliament. This agreement became known as the &quot;grand coalition&quot; and, aside from a break in the fifth Parliament, it has dominated the Parliament for much of its life, regardless of necessity. The grand coalition is visible in the agreement between the two Groups to divide the five-year term of the President of the European Parliament equally between them, with an EPP president for half the term and a PES president for the other half, regardless of the actual election result.

====Group cooperation====
Table 3 of 21 August 2008 version of working paper by Hix and Noury gave figures for the level of cooperation between each group (how many times they vote with a group, and how many times they vote against) for the Fifth and Sixth Parliaments. The results are given in the tables below, where 0% = never votes with, 100% = always votes with.

EUL/NGL and G/EFA voted closely together, as did PES and ALDE, and EPP-ED and UEN. Surprisingly, given that PES and EPP-ED are partners in the Grand Coalition, they were not each other&#x27;s closest allies, although they did vote with each other about two-thirds of the time. IND/DEM did not have close allies within the political groups, preferring instead to cooperate most closely with the Non-Inscrits.

====Breaking coalitions====
During the fifth term the ELDR Group were involved in a break in the grand coalition when they entered into an alliance with the European People&#x27;s Party, to the exclusion of the Party of European Socialists. This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and PES as before.

However, ELDR intervention was not the only cause for a break in the grand coalition. There have been specific occasions where real left-right party politics have emerged, notably the resignation of the Santer Commission. When the initial allegations against the Commission Budget emerged, they were directed primarily against the PES Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín. PES supported the commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. EPP disagreed. Whilst the Parliament was considering rejecting the Community budget, President Jacques Santer argued that a &quot;No&quot; vote would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. PES leader Pauline Green MEP attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward countermotions. During this period the two Groups adopted a government-opposition dynamic, with PES supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down.

In 2004 there was another notable break in the grand coalition. It occurred over the nomination of Rocco Buttiglione as European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security. The EPP supported the appointment of Buttiglione, while the PES, who were also critics of the President-designate Jose Manuel Barroso, led the parties seeking Buttiglione&#x27;s removal following his rejection (the first in EU history) by a Parliamentary committee. Barroso initially stood by his team and offered only small concessions, which were rejected by the PES. The EPP demanded that if Buttiglione were to go, then a PES commissioner must also be sacrificed for balance. In the end, Italy withdrew Buttiglione and put forward Franco Frattini instead. Frattini won the support of the PES and the Barroso Commission was finally approved, albeit behind schedule. Politicisation such as the above has been increasing, with Simon Hix of the London School of Economics noting in 2007 that
The dynamical coalitions in the European Parliament show year-to-year changes.

====Group switching====
Party group switching in the European Parliament is the phenomenon where parliamentarians individually or collectively switch from one party group to the other. The phenomenon of EP party group switching is a well-known contributor to the volatility of the EP party system and highlights the fluidity that characterizes the composition of European political groups. On average 9% of MEPs switch during legislative terms. Party group switching is a phenomenon that gained force especially in the legislatures during the 1990s, up to a maximum of 18% for the 1989–1994 term, with strong prevalence among representatives from France and Italy, though by no means limited to those two countries. There is a clear tendency of party group switches from the ideological extremes, both left and right, toward the center. Most switching takes place at the outset of legislative terms, with another peak around the half-term moment, when responsibilities rotate within the EP hierarchy.

==History==


The political groups of the European Parliament have been around in one form or another since September 1952 and the first meeting of the Parliament&#x27;s predecessor, the Common Assembly. The groups are coalitions of MEPs and the European parties and national parties that those MEPs belong to. The groups have coalesced into representations of the dominant schools of European political thought and are the primary actors in the Parliament.

The first three Groups were established in the earliest days of the Parliament. They were the &quot;Socialist Group&quot; (which eventually became the S&amp;D group), the &quot;Christian Democrat Group&quot; (later EPP group) and the &quot;Liberals and Allies Group&quot; (later Renew Europe).

As the Parliament developed, other Groups emerged. Gaullists from France founded the European Democratic Union Group. When Conservatives from Denmark and the United Kingdom joined, they created the European Conservatives Group, which (after some name changes) eventually merged with the Group of the European People&#x27;s Party.

The 1979 first direct election established further groups and the establishment of European political parties such as the European People&#x27;s Party.

===Compositions of past European Parliaments===
====Fifth European Parliament ====
==== Sixth European Parliament ====

The mandate of the previous European Parliament ran from 2004 and 2009. It was composed of the following political groups.
Table 3 of the 3 January 2008 version of a working paper from the London School of Economics/Free University of Brussels by Hix and Noury considered the positions of the groups in the Sixth Parliament (2004–2009) by analysing their roll-call votes. The results for each group are shown in the adjacent diagram. The vertical scale is the anti-pro Europe spectrum, (0% = extremely anti-Europe, 100% = extremely pro), and the horizontal scale is the economic left-right spectrum, (0% = extremely economically left-wing, 100% = extremely economically right-wing). The results are also shown in the table below.

Two of the groups (EPP-ED and IND/DEM) were split. EPP-ED are split on Euroscepticism: the EPP subgroup ( ) were centre-right Europhiles, whereas the ED subgroup ( ) were right-wing Eurosceptics.

IND/DEM was also split along its subgroups: the reformist subgroup ( , bottom-center) voted as centrist Eurosceptics, and the secessionist subgroup ( , middle-right) voted as right-wing Euroneutrals. The reformist subgroup was able to pursue a reformist agenda via the Parliament. The secessionist subgroup was unable to pursue a secessionist agenda there (it&#x27;s out of the Parliament&#x27;s purview) and pursued a right-wing agenda instead. This resulted in the secessionist subgroup being &quot;less&quot; Eurosceptic in terms of roll-call votes than other, non-eurosceptic parties. UKIP (the major component of the secessionist subgroup) was criticised for this seeming abandonment of its Eurosceptic core principles.

Table 2 of a 2005 discussion paper from the Institute for International Integration Studies by Gail McElroy and Kenneth Benoit analysed the group positions between April and June 2004, at the end of the Fifth Parliament and immediately before the 2004 elections. The results are given below, with 0% = extremely against, 100% = extremely for (except for the left-right spectrum, where 0% = extremely left-wing, 100% = extremely right-wing)

==== Seventh European Parliament ====

==== Eighth European Parliament ====
Major changes compared to the period 2004–2009 were:
* The formation of a new political group, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR). This conservative, Eurosceptic group was headed by 26 MEPs from the UK&#x27;s Conservative Party.
* The Eurosceptic Independence/Democracy (IND/DEM) and Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) groups suffered heavy losses in the election. On their own, they no longer had enough MEPs to form a separate group. MEPs formerly from these groups formed the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) group on 1 July 2009.
* The centre-right European People&#x27;s Party now formed its own political group in its entirety, as the former members of the European Democrats left the group to join the ECR.
* The political group of the Party of European Socialists renamed itself to the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats or Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) to accommodate the Democratic Party of Italy. The Democratic Party did not become member of the Party of European Socialists until February 2014.

==== Ninth European Parliament ====


===History according to group===
Some of the groups (such as the PES and S&amp;D Group) have become homogeneous units coterminous with their European political party, some (such as IND/DEM) have not. But they are still coalitions, not parties in their own right, and do not issue manifestos of their own. It may therefore be difficult to discern how the groups intend to vote without first inspecting the party platforms of their constituent parties, and then with limited certainty.

====Christian democrats and conservatives====
In European politics, the centre-right is usually occupied by Christian democrats and conservatives. These two ideological strands have had a tangled relationship in the Parliament. The first Christian Democrat Group was founded in 1953 and stayed with that name for a quarter of a century. Meanwhile, outside the Parliament, local Christian-democratic parties were organising and eventually formed the pan-national political party called the &quot;European People&#x27;s Party&quot; on 29 April 1976. Since all the Christian-democratic MEPs were members of this pan-European party, the Group&#x27;s name was changed to indicate this: first to the &quot;Christian-Democratic Group (Group of the European People&#x27;s Party)&quot; on 14 March 1978, then to &quot;Group of the European People&#x27;s Party (Christian Democrats)&quot; on 17 July 1979. Meanwhile, on 16 January 1973, the &quot;European Conservative Group&quot; was formed by the British and Danish Conservative parties, which had recently joined the EEC. This group was renamed to the &quot;European Democratic Group&quot; on 17 July 1979. The EPP Group grew during the 1980s, with conservative parties such as New Democracy of Greece and the People&#x27;s Party of Spain joining the Group. In contrast, the number of MEPs in the European Democratic Group fell over the same period and it eventually merged with the EPP Group on 1 May 1992. This consolidation of the centre-right continued during the 1990s, with MEPs from the Italian centre-right party being admitted into the EPP Group on 15 June 1998, after spending nearly a year (19 July 1994 to 6 July 1995) in their own Group, self-referentially called &quot;Forza Europa&quot;, and nearly three years (6 July 1995 to 15 June 1998) in the national-conservative Group called &quot;Union for Europe&quot;. But the Conservatives were growing restless and on 20 July 1999 the EPP Group was renamed to the &quot;Group of the European People&#x27;s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats&quot; (EPP-ED) to identify the Conservative parties within the Group. The Group remained under that name until after the 2009 European elections, when it reverted to the title &quot;Group of the European People&#x27;s Party (Christian Democrats)&quot; upon the exit of the European Democrats subgroup and the formation of the &quot;European Conservatives and Reformists&quot; group in June 2009.

====Social democrats====

In Western Europe, social-democratic parties have been the dominant centre-left force since the dawn of modern European cooperation. The Socialist Group was one of the first Groups to be founded when it was created on 23 June 1953 in the European Parliament&#x27;s predecessor, the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community, and continued through the creation of the appointed Parliament in 1958 and the elected Parliament in 1979. Meanwhile, the national parties making up the Group were also organising themselves on a European level &quot;outside&quot; the Parliament, with the parties creating the &quot;Confederation of Socialist Parties of the European Community&quot; in 1974 and its successor, the &quot;Party of European Socialists&quot;, in 1992. As a result, the Group (which had kept its &quot;Socialist Group&quot; name all along) was renamed to the &quot;Group of the Party of European Socialists&quot; on 21 April 1993 and it became difficult to distinguish between the Party of European Socialists party and the political group. The Group reverted to (approximately) its former name of the &quot;Socialist Group in the European Parliament&quot;. on 20 July 2004 Despite all this, the Group was still universally referred to as &quot;PES&quot;, notwithstanding the 2009 name change to the &quot;Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats&quot; to accommodate the Democratic Party of Italy.

====Liberals and centrists====

In European politics, liberalism tends to be associated with ideas inspired by classical and economic liberalism, which advocates limited government intervention in society. However, the Liberal Group contains diverse parties, including conservative-liberal, social-liberal and Nordic agrarian parties. It has previously been home to parties such as the minor French Gaullist party Union for the New Republic and the Social Democratic Party of Portugal, which were not explicitly liberal parties, but who were not aligned with either the Socialist or the Christian Democratic Groups. The Liberal Group was founded on 23 June 1953 under the name of the &quot;Group of Liberals and Allies&quot;. As the Parliament grew, it changed its name to the &quot;Liberal and Democratic Group&quot; (1976), then to the &quot;Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group&quot; (13 December 1985), then to the &quot;Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party&quot; (19 July 1994) before settling on the name of the &quot;Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe&quot; on 20 July 2004, when the Group was joined by the centrist parties that formed the European Democratic Party.

ELDR Group leader Graham Watson MEP denounced the grand coalition in 2007 and expressed a desire to ensure that the posts of Commission President, Council President, Parliament President and High Representative were not divided based on agreement between the two largest groups to the exclusion of third parties.

Between 1994 and 1999 there was a separate &quot;European Radical Alliance&quot;, which consisted of MEPs of the French &quot;Energie Radicale&quot;, the Italian Bonino List, and regionalists aligned with the European Free Alliance.

The current name as of 2020 is &quot;Renew Europe&quot;.

====Eurosceptic conservatives====

Parties from certain European countries have been unwilling to join the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party Group. These parties generally have a liberal conservative but eurosceptic agenda. The first such Group was formed when the French Gaullists split from the Liberal Group on 21 January 1965 and created a new Group called the &quot;European Democratic Union&quot; (&quot;not&quot; to be confused with the association of conservative and Christian-democratic parties founded in 1978 called the European Democrat Union nor the Conservative Group called the &quot;European Democratic Group&quot; founded in 1979). The Group was renamed on 16 January 1973 to the &quot;Group of European Progressive Democrats&quot; when the Gaullists were joined by the Irish Fianna Fáil and Scottish National Party, and renamed itself again on 24 July 1984 to the &quot;Group of the European Democratic Alliance&quot;. The European Democratic Alliance joined with MEPs from to become the &quot;Union for Europe&quot; on 6 July 1995, but it did not last and the MEPs left on 15 June 1998 to join the EPP, leaving Union for Europe to struggle on until it split on 20 July 1999. The French Rally for the Republic members joined the EPP, but Fianna Fáil and the Portuguese CDS–PP members joined a new group called the &quot;Union for Europe of the Nations&quot;. After the 2009 Parliament elections the Union for Europe of Nations was disbanded due to a lack of members, with the remaining members splitting into factions, with some joining with the remaining members of Independence/Democracy to form Europe of Freedom and Democracy, a new Eurosceptic group, and the remaining members joining with the former members of the European Democrat subgroup of the EPP-ED to form the European Conservatives and Reformists.

====Greens and regionalists====

In European politics, there has been a coalition between the greens and the stateless nationalists or regionalists (who also support devolution). In 1984 Greens and regionalists gathered into the &quot;Rainbow Group&quot;, a coalition of Greens, regionalists and other parties of the left unaffiliated with any of the international organisations. In 1989, the group split: the Greens went off to form the &quot;Green Group&quot;, whilst the regionalists stayed in Rainbow. Rainbow collapsed in 1994 and its members joined the &quot;European Radical Alliance&quot; under the French &quot;Energie Radicale&quot;. The Greens and regionalists stayed separate until 1999, when they reunited under the &quot;Greens/European Free Alliance&quot; banner.

====Communists and socialists====

The first communist group in the European Parliament was the &quot;Communist and Allies Group&quot; founded on 16 October 1973. It stayed together until 25 July 1989 when it split into two groups, the &quot;Left Unity&quot; Group with 14 members and the &quot;Group of the European United Left&quot; (EUL) with 28 members. EUL collapsed in January 1993 after the Italian Communist Party became the Democratic Party of the Left and its MEPs joined the PES Group, leaving Left Unity as the only leftist group before the 1994 elections. The name was resurrected immediately after the elections when the &quot;Confederal Group of the European United Left&quot; was formed on 19 July 1994. On 6 January 1995, when parties from Sweden and Finland joined, the Group was further renamed to the &quot;Confederal Group of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left&quot; and it has stayed that way to the present.

====Right-wing nationalists====
In European politics, a grouping of nationalists has thus far found it difficult to cohere in a continuous Group. The first nationalist Group was founded by the French National Front and the Italian Social Movement in 1984 under the name of the &quot;Group of the European Right&quot;, and it lasted until 1989. Its successor, the &quot;Technical Group of the European Right&quot;, existed from 1989 to 1994. There was then a gap of thirteen years until &quot;Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty&quot; was founded on 15 January 2007, which lasted for nearly eleven months until it fell apart on 14 November 2007 due to in-fighting.

A new radical right group was formed during the 8th parliament on 16 June 2015 under the name &quot;Europe of Nations and Freedom&quot;.

====Eurosceptics====
The school of political thought that states that the competences of the European Union should be reduced or prevented from expanding further, is represented in the European Parliament by the eurosceptics. The first Eurosceptic group in the European Parliament was founded on 19 July 1994. It was called the &quot;European Nations Group&quot; and it lasted until 10 November 1996. Its successor was the &quot;Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations&quot;, founded on 20 December 1996. Following the 1999 European elections, the Group was reorganised into the &quot;Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities&quot; on 20 July 1999, and similarly reorganised after the 2004 election into the &quot;Independence/Democracy Group&quot; on 20 July 2004. The group&#x27;s leaders were Nigel Farage (UKIP) and Kathy Sinnott (Independent, Ireland). After the 2009 European elections, a significant proportion of the IND/DEM members joined the &quot;Europe of Freedom and Democracy&quot;, which included parties formerly part of the Union for a Europe of Nations. The EFD group&#x27;s leaders were Farage and Francesco Speroni of the Lega Nord (Italy). With significant changes in membership after the 2014 European elections, the group was re-formed as &quot;Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy&quot;, led by Farage and David Borrelli (Five Star Movement, Italy).

====Heterogeneous====

A Group is assumed to have a set of core principles (&quot;affinities&quot; or &quot;complexion&quot;) to which the full members are expected to adhere. This throws up an anomaly: Groups get money and seats on Committees which Independent members do not get, but the total number of Independent members may be greater than the members of the smaller Groups. In 1979, MEPs got around this by forming a technical group (formally called the &quot;Group for the Technical Coordination and Defence of Independent Groups and Members&quot;, or &quot;CDI&quot; for short) as a coalition of parties ranging from centre-left to far-left, which were not aligned with any of the major international organizations. CDI lasted until 1984. On 20 July 1999, another technical group was formed, (formally called the &quot;Technical Group of Independent Members – mixed group&quot; or &quot;TGI&quot; for short). Since it contained far-right MEPs and centre-left MEPs, it could not possibly be depicted as having a common outlook. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs ruled that TGI did not have a coherent political complexion, Parliament upheld (412 to 56 with 36 abstentions) the ruling, and TGI was thus disbanded on 13 September 1999, the first Group to be forcibly dissolved. However, the ruling was appealed to the European Court of First Instance and the Group was temporarily resurrected on 1 December 1999 until the Court came to a decision. On 3 October 2001, president Fontaine announced that the Court of First Instance had declared against the appeal and that the disbandment was back in effect from 2 October 2001, the date of the declaration. TGI appeared on the list of Political Groups in the European Parliament for the last time on 4 October 2001. Since then the requirement that Groups have a coherent political complexion has been enforced (as ITS later found out), and &quot;mixed&quot; Groups are not expected to appear again.

====Independents====
Independent MEPs that are not in a Group are categorised as &quot;Non-Inscrits&quot; (the French term is universally used, even in English translations). This non-group has no group privileges or funding and is included here solely for completeness.

<doc id="1142028" wikidata="Q213047" url="?curid=1142028" title="Andean mountain cat">
<text>The Andean mountain cat (Leopardus jacobita) is a small wild cat native to the high Andes that has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because fewer than 1,500 individuals are thought to exist in the wild. It is traditionally considered a sacred animal by indigenous Aymara and Quechua people.

The Andean mountain cat was first described by Emilio Cornalia, who named it in honor of Jacobita Mantegazza. It is a monotypic species.

==Characteristics==
The Andean mountain cat has ashy-gray fur, a grey head, and rounded ears. The nose and lips are black, and the areas around them are white; two dark brown lines run from the corners of the eyes across the cheeks. There are black spots on the forelegs, yellowish-brown blotches on the flanks, and up to two narrow, dark rings on the hind limbs. The long, bushy tail has six to nine rings, which are dark brown to black. The markings of juveniles are darker and smaller than those of adults. The skulls of adult specimens range in length from and are larger than those of the pampas cat and domestic cat.

On the back and the tail, the hair is long. Its rounded footprints are long and wide. Its pads are covered with hair. Adult individuals range from in head-to-body length with a long tail, a shoulder height of about and a body weight of up to .

The Andean mountain cat and pampas cat look similar. This similarity makes it difficult to identify which cat is observed and estimate their populations correctly, especially when attempting to gain correct information from the observations of individuals who have seen one of these cats but are unaware of specific features to distinguish between them.
==Distribution and habitat==

The Andean mountain cat lives only at high elevations in the Andes. Records in Argentina indicate that it lives at elevations from in the southern Andes to over in Chile, Bolivia and central Peru. This terrain is arid, sparsely vegetated, rocky and steep showing that the Andean Mountain Cat prefers a temperate and terrestrial habitat. The population in the Salar de Surire Natural Monument was estimated at five individuals in an area of . Results of a survey in the Jujuy Province of northwestern Argentina indicates a density of seven to twelve individuals per at an elevation of about .

Deep valleys fragment its habitat in the Andes, and its preferred prey, mountain viscachas (&quot;Lagidium&quot;), occurs in patchy colonies. Across this range, the level of genetic diversity is very low.

== Behavior and ecology ==
The Andean cat is sympatric with the pampas cat and the cougar. The viscacha comprises 93.9% of the biomass consumed in the Andean cat&#x27;s diet, while the pampas cat depends on it for 74.8%. Both cats depend on specific prey for their dietary needs. In some areas, the mountain viscacha makes up 53% of the Andean cat&#x27;s prey items despite making up the vast majority of the biomass that it consumes. This difference is because the mountain viscacha is significantly larger in biomass than the other prey animals that the Andean cat hunts. Other prey and food groups include small reptiles, birds, and other small mammals such as tuco-tuco. They also hunt frequently during the same periods. During one study, both the Andean cat and the pampas cat were seen most frequently during moonless nights; the second most sightings of these cats were during full moons.

Based on residents&#x27; observations of Andean cats in coupled pairs with their litters, it is thought that the mating season is in July and August. Due to kittens being seen in April and October, the mating season could extend into November or December, although not much information is known about their breeding habits. A litter usually consists of one or two offspring born in the spring and summer months. This is also common in other species that have their young when food resources are increasing, which can influence the survival rate of the young.

==Threats==
Such factors as habitat loss and degradation, hunting, and disease threaten the Andean cat.

==Conservation==
The Andean Cat is also listed on the IUCN Red List, the US Federal List, and the CITES Appendix I. It is protected in all the countries of its range.

The Andean Cat Alliance was formed in 2003 by representatives from Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, and Chile to foster research and conservation of the Andean cat.

<text>Vice-Admiral Gordon Campbell, (6 January 1886 – 3 October 1953) was a British naval officer, writer, politician and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was also awarded the Croix de Guerre and appointed a chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur for his actions during the First World War.

==Early life and career==
Born on 6 January 1886 to Frederick Campbell, he was educated at Dulwich College, which he attended between 1898 and 1900. He then joined the Royal Navy and was in October 1902 posted as a midshipman to the battleship serving in the Mediterranean Sea. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1907 and to commander in March 1916. It was during the First World War that he was awarded the Victoria Cross for the following action:
Campbell also commanded during the action of 8 August 1917 when she was sunk by SM &quot;UC-71&quot;. Victoria Crosses were awarded to two members of the crew who were selected by ballot from amongst the crew of &quot;Dunraven&quot;, Lieutenant Charles George Bonner and Petty Officer Ernest Herbert Pitcher. Campbell received his second Bar to his Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

==Later life==
Campbell later achieved the rank of vice admiral. He commanded the battlecruiser from 1925 to 1927 and served as Naval Aide-de-Camp to George V from 1928 to 1929. In 1931, he was elected as National Member of Parliament for Burnley, defeating the Labour leader, Arthur Henderson. In 1935, however, standing as a Liberal National, he lost his seat.

In the Second World War, Campbell was recalled to the Royal Navy and, serving in the rank of commander, was responsible for anti-invasion measures around Padstow.

Campbell wrote several publications, including the successful &quot;My Mystery Ships&quot;. His brother, Sir Edward Campbell, 1st Baronet, was also a Member of Parliament.

His Victoria Cross is held at his old school, Dulwich College.

<text>Air Polonia was the first privately owned low-cost airline in Poland with its headquarters in Warsaw and its largest operations base at Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport. On 5 December 2004 Air Polonia ceased operations due to financial difficulties.

== History ==

Air Polonia was created in 2001 and quickly gained popularity. It started low-cost operations on 8 December 2003 using its Boeing 737-400s offering flights from Warsaw to Wrocław, London Stansted and Gdańsk, Katowice to London Stansted and Poznań to London Stansted.

Air Polonia&#x27;s marketing campaigns targeted above all LOT but also non-Polish airlines flying to Poland such as British Airways or other no-frills airlines such as Germanwings. It is also speculated that Air Polonia&#x27;s growing popularity altered Ryanair&#x27;s expansion into Poland.

== Revival of Air Polonia ==

In January 2005, it was announced that Air Polonia was planning to resume operations with three Boeing 737-400s, but as of September 2019 it had not happened.

== Destinations ==
Air Polonia flew charter and scheduled services across Europe, including to Warsaw (HQ), Gdańsk (base), Katowice (base), Wrocław (base), Poznań, Cologne, Stockholm Arlanda, Stockholm Skavsta, Rome Ciampino, Athens, Beauvais, Brussels, Bydgoszcz, Faro, Frankfurt, London Stansted, Luqa, Madrid, Málaga, Manchester, Monastir, Palma De Mallorca, Paris Charles De Gaulle, Riga, Seville, Sharm El Sheikh, Szczecin and Tenerife.

== Fleet ==

Air Polonia operated the following aircraft throughout operations:

<text>The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA), codified at , supplements the Securities Act of 1933 in the case of the distribution of debt securities in the United States. Generally speaking, the TIA requires the appointment of a suitably independent and qualified trustee to act for the benefit of the holders of the securities, and specifies various substantive provisions for the trust indenture that must be entered into by the issuer and the trustee. The TIA is administered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has made various regulations under the act.

== History ==
Section 211 of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandated that the SEC conduct various studies. Although not expressly required to study the trustee system then in use for the issuance of debt securities, William O. Douglas, who would later become a Commissioner and then Chair of the SEC, was convinced by November 1934 that the system needed legislative reform. In June 1936, the Protective Committee Study, headed by Douglas, published its report &quot;Trustees Under Indentures&quot;. It recommended that:

#trustees of indentures be disqualified where they have or acquire conflicts of interest incompatible with their fiduciary obligations;
#they be transformed into active trustees with respect to their obligations; and
#legislation separate from the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would be more appropriate to govern this matter.

The Trust Indenture Act was subsequently passed and signed into law in August 1939. Its legislative history shows that that Congress intended to address deficiencies prevalent in trust indentures at the time:

:* the failure of indentures to require evidence of an obligor’s performance thereunder,
:* the lack of disclosure and reporting requirements, and
:* the presence of significant obstacles to collective bondholder action.

== Framework ==

=== Regulatory ===
Subject to certain exceptions, it is unlawful for any person to sell notes, bonds, or debentures in interstate commerce unless the security has been issued under an indenture and qualified under the Act. Trustees appointed under such indentures have specified duties:

:* § 314(d) requires certificates and opinions as to the fair value of the collateral being released, but relief in the form of a &quot;no-action letter&quot; is available from the SEC in certain circumstances
:* § 313(b) requires specified reports to holders with respect to the release of collateral

Complications as to financial reporting requirements can arise where the indentures are secured by a pledge of stock, in which case Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X may come into play. Many issuers attempt to mitigate the impact by inserting &quot;collateral cut-back&quot; provisions into their indentures, but the SEC has not endorsed the concept that such a cut-back does not constitute a release of collateral.

=== Statutory prohibition of impairment ===
§ 316(b) provides that &quot;the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder...&quot; This prohibition is subject to several exceptions:

:* the temporary postponement of interest payments under § 316(a)(2)
:* an indenture may contain a provision limiting or denying the right of a bondholder to sue if and to the extent that that suit would, under applicable law, result in an adverse effect on a lien securing the bonds.
:* an application under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code

This provision saw little litigation prior to 1992. Recent jurisprudence (especially in the Southern District of New York) has expanded its reach, holding that the Act &quot;protects the &quot;ability&quot;, and not merely the formal right, to receive payment in some circumstances,&quot; and ruling that impairment includes stripping a company&#x27;s assets and removing any corporate guarantees. While this may result in more distressed issuers resorting to Chapter 11 to pursue restructuring efforts, other issuers may be prohibited from filing for such reliefby virtue of their reliance on federal funding or otherwiseand thus may be precluded from altering the repayment terms of their bond debt altogether.

<text>Robert W. Loughery (February 2, 1820 – 1894) was a 19th-century United States newspaper publisher and editor who worked for or owned newspapers in Louisiana and Texas.

All of his papers were published in major cities of both states and included Galveston, Texas, Jefferson, Texas, Marshall, Texas, Monroe, Louisiana, and Shreveport, Louisiana. Two of his Marshall newspapers the &quot;Texas Republican&quot; and the &quot;Tri-Weekly Herald&quot; were credited with aiding the election of Marshall citizens, J.P. Henderson, Edward Clark, and Pendleton Murrah to the Governor&#x27;s office and Louis T. Wigfall to the U.S. Senate. Loughery often defended slavery and plantation agriculture in his papers; and supported secession and later the Confederacy. He supported reconciliation with the Union and acceptance of defeat of the Confederacy in the Civil War until congress approved Reconstruction.

<text>The Midland Railway was a heritage railroad operating 16 miles of line in Franklin County and Douglas County in Kansas between Ottawa, Kansas and Baldwin City, Kansas.

It was chartered in 1982 to find an abandoned railroad line to operate. Midland purchased the line from Baldwin City to Ottawa from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (&quot;AT&amp;SF&quot;) in 1987, and began running excursion trains on part of the line later that year. Total length of the line is 16 miles (17.7 km).

Midland operated a demonstration historic railroad, and its mission was to &quot;educate the public about the role railroading played, and continues to play, in the commercial, social, and cultural life of America&#x27;s Heartland.&quot; Midland&#x27;s base of operations was the depot built in 1906 by the AT&amp;SF at 1515 High Street in Baldwin City. This building was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Douglas County, Kansas in 1983. Midland had received two matching federal grants to rebuild track. Private grants were used to rebuild railroad equipment. Starting in 2004, excursion trains were run all the way from Baldwin City to Ottawa.

The regular operating season ran from Memorial Day (last Monday of May) to October 31 (Halloween). Special events and fairs were held at various times through the year. Weekend Boy Scout camps were held in the spring and fall. Midland&#x27;s Scout program was one of the few in the country to offer the Railroading merit badge.

==Surface Transportation Board==
A May 31, 2019 decision by the Surface Transportation Board stated:

==Baldwin City &amp; Southern Railroad==
In 2019, the Midland Railway created a wholly-owned, for-profit subsidiary called the Leavenworth, Lawrence and Galveston Railroad, but doing business as the Baldwin City &amp; Southern Railroad (BC&amp;SR). The original plan was for the BC&amp;SR to take over all active railroad operations, while Midland would focus on public education and historic preservation. In November of 2019 the BC&amp;SR was awarded a $750,000 Kansas Department of Commerce grant to help with operational costs to transition from the all-volunteer model under which Midland operated, to an employee-based model, with a grant requirement to have at least 22 employees. However, the BC&amp;SR service was discontinued in March of 2020 following a rent dispute with the operator of Baldwin City’s historic train depot.

==Midland Railroad==
An entity called Midland Railroad LLC. filed notice with the Surface Transportation Board on September 15, 2022 that it was acquiring this rail line, and intended to replace the Leavenworth, Lawrence &amp; Galveston Railroad d/b/a the Baldwin City &amp; Southern Railroad as the common carrier service provider over said line. However, this transaction was never completed.

==Ottawa Northern Railroad==
On March 9, 2023, the Ottawa Northern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, filed notice with the Surface Transportation Board that it was acquiring the line, and replacing the Leavenworth, Lawrence &amp; Galveston Railroad d/b/a the Baldwin City &amp; Southern Railroad Company as the common carrier service provider on it. The notice indicated in part that there were currently no customers on the line, and accordingly, no shippers to notify. As of April, 2024, the Ottawa Northern Railroad indicates on its website that it completed the acquisition, and that plans are in the works to bring back the excursion trains.

==Kansas Belle Dinner Train== 
The Kansas Belle Dinner Train, which also operated out of the Baldwin City depot, utilized Midland Railway’s track and locomotives but was separately owned. That train on March 14, 2020 also suspended services, and had not resumed them by April 2024. After waiting 4 years for operations to resume, the train set was sold in autumn of that year.

<text>Macewen&#x27;s sign or Macewen sign ( ) is a sign used to help to diagnose hydrocephalus (accumulation of excess cerebrospinal fluid) and brain abscesses. Tapping (percussion) the skull near the junction of the frontal, temporal, and parietal bones will produce cracked pot sound. Positive test is indication of separated sutures. This is due to raised intracranial tension.

The sign was discovered and described by Sir William Macewen (1848–1924), a surgeon and professor of the University of Glasgow, Scotland, who also described Macewen&#x27;s operation for inguinal hernia.

McEwan&#x27;s sign in alcohol intoxication is different: Pupils are contracted, but on external painful stimulation of the person (e.g. by pinching or slapping) causes pupil to dilate followed by slow constriction. It is suggestive of alcoholic coma.

<text>The Project 690 Kefal (&quot;Mullet&quot;) class (known in the West by its NATO reporting name Bravo class) was a design of military submarines that were built in the Soviet Union. The boats were designed for use in ASW exercises, but could also be employed in a combat role. Four vessels were built, which were commissioned into the Soviet Navy between 1967 and 1970. All four boats were stricken in the 1990s.

<text>The Opal Coast ( ; ) is a coastal region in northern France on the English Channel, popular with tourists.

== Geography ==

The &quot;Côte d&#x27;Opale&quot; is a coastal region in northeastern France, in the departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais. It extends over of French coast between the Belgian border and the border with Picardy. This coastline faces the English Channel and the North Sea, and is situated directly opposite the chalk cliffs of southeast England, which at the closest point are only away.

The Côte d&#x27;Opale is composed of many varied landscapes including beaches, dunes, swamps, estuaries and cliffs. The coast is marked by the presence of two large promontories situated between Calais and Boulogne: the Cap Gris Nez (literally &quot;grey nose cape&quot; in English), reaching an elevation of above sea level, and the Cap Blanc Nez (literally &quot;white nose cape&quot; in English), which reaches . These capes are the closest points to England on the entire French coast.

<doc id="1142120" wikidata="Q1067794" url="?curid=1142120" title="Candlestick chart">
<text>A candlestick chart (also called Japanese candlestick chart or K-line) is a style of financial chart used to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency.

While similar in appearance to a bar chart, each candlestick represents four important pieces of information for that day: open and close in the thick body, and high and low in the &quot;candle wick&quot;. Being densely packed with information, it tends to represent trading patterns over short periods of time, often a few days or a few trading sessions.
Candlestick charts are most often used in technical analysis of equity and currency price patterns. They are used by traders to determine possible price movement based on past patterns, and who use the opening price, closing price, high and low of that time period. They are visually similar to box plots, though box plots show different information.

==History==
Candlestick charts are thought to have been developed in the 18th century by Munehisa Homma, a Japanese rice trader. They were introduced to the Western world by Steve Nison in his book &quot;Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques&quot;, first published in 1991. They are often used today in stock analysis along with other analytical tools such as Fibonacci analysis.
In &quot;Beyond Candlesticks&quot;, Nison says:
However, based on my research, it is unlikely that Homma used candle charts. As will be seen later, when I discuss the evolution of the candle charts, it was more likely that candle charts were developed in the early part of the Meiji period in Japan (in the late 1800s).

==Description==
The area between the open and the close is called the &quot;real body&quot;, price excursions above and below the real body are &quot;shadows&quot; (also called &quot;wicks&quot;). Wicks illustrate the highest and lowest traded prices of an asset during the time interval represented. The body illustrates the opening and closing trades.

The price range is the distance between the top of the upper shadow and the bottom of the lower shadow moved through during the time frame of the candlestick. The range is calculated by subtracting the low price from the high price.

The fill or the color of the candle&#x27;s body represent the price change during the period. Normally, if the asset closed higher than it opened, the body is displayed as hollow (or the green color is used), with the opening price at the bottom of the body and the closing price at the top. Conversely, if the asset closed lower than it opened, the body is displayed as filled (or the red color is used), with the opening price at the top and the closing price at the bottom. Modern charting software permits unrestricted customization of candle looks and colors, so the actual look of rising or falling price candles may vary.

A version of a candlestick chart is a &quot;hollow candlestick&quot; chart, where both fill and color are used to represent different price relationships:
* Solid candles show that the current close price is less than the current open price.
* Hollow candles show that the current close price is greater than the current open price.
* Red candles show that the current close price is less than the previous close price.
* Green candles show that the current close price is greater than the previous close price.

A candlestick need not have either a body or a wick. Generally, the longer the body of the candle, the more intense the trading.
Candlesticks can also show the current price as they&#x27;re forming, whether the price moved up or down over the time phrase and the price range of the asset covered in that time.

Rather than using the open, high, low, and close values for a given time interval, candlesticks can also be constructed using the open, high, low, and close of a specified volume range (for example, 1,000; 100,000; 1 million shares per candlestick). In modern charting software, volume can be incorporated into candlestick charts by increasing or decreasing candlesticks width according to the relative volume for a given time period.

==Usage==

Candlestick charts are a visual aid for decision making in stock, foreign exchange, commodity, and option trading. By looking at a candlestick, one can identify an asset&#x27;s opening and closing prices, highs and lows, and overall range for a specific time frame. Candlestick charts serve as a cornerstone of technical analysis. For example, when the bar is white and high relative to other time periods, it means buyers are very bullish. The opposite is true when there is a black bar.

A candlestick pattern is a particular sequence of candlesticks on a candlestick chart, which is mainly used to identify trends.

==Heikin-Ashi candlesticks==
Heikin-Ashi (平均足, Japanese for &#x27;average bar&#x27;) candlesticks are a weighted version of candlesticks calculated in the following way:

* Close = (real open + real high + real low + real close) / 4
* Open = (previous Heikin-Ashi open + previous Heikin-Ashi close) / 2
* High = max(real high, Heikin-Ashi open, Heikin-Ashi close)
* Low = min(real low, Heikin-Ashi open, Heikin-Ashi close)

The body of a Heikin-Ashi candle does not always represent the actual open/close. Unlike with regular candlesticks, a long wick shows more strength, whereas the same period on a standard chart might show a long body with little or no wick.

<text>Wolseley UK is a supplier of building materials, with trade customers (plumbers and builders) accounting for the largest proportion of its sales. Wolseley are the largest trade specialist in plumbing and heating in the UK. It has retail showrooms around the United Kingdom which are open to the general public.

==History==
The Wolseley business began in 1887 making sheep shearing machinery, by Frederick York Wolseley. Herbert Austin, who had worked on Wolseley&#x27;s shearing machinery development in Melbourne, Australia from 1887, when he was aged just 20, was appointed its manager and received a share of its equity.

Seeking other suitable products, Austin designed his first car in 1896, and for the next four years, continued to develop and improve his designs. Though the board did allow Austin to purchase some machinery to build cars, they decided around 1900, it was unlikely to be a profitable industry. In 1901, Wolseley&#x27;s embryo car business was acquired by Vickers, Sons and Maxim.

The postwar rise of synthetic textiles sharply reduced the demand for wool and the necessary machinery, and in 1960, Wolseley diversified activities, by buying Nu Way Heating Limited. Nu Way Burners Limited was founded in 1932 in Vines Lane, Droitwich Spa, Oil Burner Components Limited was founded by Nu Way in 1959, as a national spares organisation. Out of that grew O.B.C. Limited, and then Wolseley Centers Limited, the major distributor of plumbing and central heating equipment. In 1965, Wolseley purchased Granville Controls and Yorkshire Heating Supplies.

Wolseley continued to expand buying both manufacturing and distribution businesses. In 1982, it entered the market in the United States by acquiring Ferguson Enterprises, a distributor of plumbing supplies, with around 50 branches on the East Coast of the United States. In 1984, some of the manufacturing businesses were sold off, and since that time Wolseley has been mainly a distribution business. The trading name of Plumb Center was acquired in the 1980s, and extended to include &quot;Build Center&quot;, &quot;Drain Center&quot;, and &quot;Hire Center&quot;.

The company&#x27;s headquarters used to be in Ripon, Yorkshire, where it was the city&#x27;s largest employer. In July 2004, the company announced that its head office was to be relocated to Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. A regional office, including the central human resources and information technology functions, remains in Ripon.

The company acquired several other companies, such as Broughton Crangrove, ENCON, and the highly successful Bathstore business, which was acquired by Wolseley Plc in June 2003, plus significant operations in France, Austria and Italy. In 2004, the company undertook a rebranding exercise, and its main outlets were known as &quot;Plumb Center&quot;, &quot;Build Center&quot; (acquired by Jewsons in July 2011), &quot;Pipe Center&quot;, &quot;Parts Center&quot;, &quot;Drain Center&quot;, &quot;Climate Center&quot; and &quot;Integrated Supply Chain&quot; (formerly &quot;Maintenance Center&quot;).

In 2010 Wolseley ended its participation in the hire industry, selling Brandon Hire for a £42m Loss. On July 13, 2011, it was announced that Wolseley was to sell off its Electric Center arm to rivals Edmundson Electrical.
With parent company Ferguson plc&#x27;s ownership of similar operations in North America, Wolseley UK was part of one of the largest network of builders merchants in the world. This gave it advantages over competitors in terms of pricing and stock. Wolseley UK is no longer involved in manufacturing; instead, it focuses on distributing and selling bought in products.

In January 2021, Wolseley UK was sold by Ferguson to a private equity firm, Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, for £308m. In July 2021, Wolseley UK bought selected Graham Plumbers&#x27; Merchant stores after Saint-Gobain divested the business.

<doc id="1142128" wikidata="Q3495342" url="?curid=1142128" title="St Mary's Hospital, London">
<text>St Mary&#x27;s Hospital is an NHS district general hospital in Paddington, in the City of Westminster, London, founded in 1845. Since the UK&#x27;s first academic health science centre was created in 2008, it has been operated by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which also operates Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital and the Western Eye Hospital.

Until 1988 the hospital ran St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School, part of the federal University of London. In 1988 it merged with Imperial College London, and then with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School in 1997 to form Imperial College School of Medicine. In 2007 Imperial College became an independent institution when it withdrew from the University of London.

==History==
===Development of the hospital===


The original block of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Norfolk Place was designed by Thomas Hopper in the classical style. It first opened its doors to patients in 1851, the last of the great voluntary hospitals to be founded. Among St Mary&#x27;s founders was the surgeon Isaac Baker Brown, a controversial figure who performed numerous clitoridectomies at the London Surgical Home, his hospital for women, and who &quot;immediately set to work to remove the clitoris whenever he had the opportunity of doing so.&quot; It was at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital that C.R. Alder Wright first synthesized diamorphine in 1874.

The Clarence Memorial Wing, designed by Sir William Emerson and built with its main frontage on Praed Street, opened in 1904. It was at the hospital that Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928. Fleming&#x27;s laboratory has been restored and incorporated into a museum about the discovery and his life and work. 
The private Lindo wing, where there have been several royal and celebrity births, opened in November 1937; it was financed by businessman and hospital board member Frank Charles Lindo, who made a large donation before his death in 1938.
Following the 1944 publication of a report by Sir William Goodenough advocating a minimum size for teaching hospitals, and following the formation of the National Health Service in the 1948, several local hospitals became affiliated to St Mary&#x27;s Hospital. These included Paddington General Hospital, the Samaritan Hospital for Women and the Western Eye Hospital.
In the 1950s, Felix Eastcott, a consultant surgeon and deputy director of the surgical unit at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, carried out pioneering work on carotid endarterectomy designed to reduce the risk of stroke. Paddington General Hospital closed and relocated services to the Paddington basin site in November 1986 and, in common with the other London teaching hospitals who lost their independence at that time, the medical school of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital merged with that of Imperial College London in 1988.

In 1987 as part of on-going rationalisation within the NHS, the hundred year old Paddington Green Children&#x27;s Hospital was closed down, the listed buildings sold off and its services absorbed into St Mary&#x27;s.

==Associations==

St Mary&#x27;s Hospital is located beside London Paddington railway station, the principal station of the Great Western Railway and its successors. In celebration of the association, a British Rail Class 43 (InterCity 125) locomotive, 43142, was named &quot;St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington&quot; on 4 November 1986. The locomotive is still in service but, following changes of ownership, the name has now been removed. One of the large metal nameplates was acquired by the hospital, and is now displayed in the foyer of the Cambridge Wing.

==Major trauma centre==
St Mary&#x27;s Hospital is one of four major trauma centres in London. The other three are: King&#x27;s College Hospital in Denmark Hill, The Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, and St George&#x27;s Hospital in Tooting.

==Cosmic Charity==
The charity Cosmic is an independent charity, supporting the work of the neonatal and paediatric intensive care services at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington and Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Hospital, Hammersmith, both part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London. The charity funds a range of specialist equipment for the units, including ventilators and patient monitoring systems for those being treated on the wards, as well as providing practical and emotional support to families.

<text>Bruce Kerry Chapman (born December 1, 1940) is the founder and current chairman of the board of the Discovery Institute, an American conservative think tank often associated with the religious right. He was previously a journalist, a Republican politician, and a diplomat. He is the author, most recently, of &quot;Politicians: The Worst Kind of People to Run the Government, Except for All the Others&quot; (Discovery Institute Press, 2018).

==Early life and career==
Born in Evanston, Illinois, Chapman graduated from Harvard University in 1962, served in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, and worked as an editorial writer for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. With his college roommate George Gilder, Chapman wrote an attack on the anti-intellectual policies of Barry Goldwater titled &quot;The Party That Lost Its Head&quot; (1966). In 1966 he moved to Seattle and wrote a book entitled &quot;The Wrong Man in Uniform&quot;, arguing against conscription, and for an all-volunteer military (Trident Press, 1967).

Chapman became active in politics through the Seattle Young Republicans, and became a member of the United States Republican Party. He was elected to the Seattle City Council in 1971. In 1975, he was appointed Secretary of State of Washington, and won election twice (1975, 1976). He campaigned for the office of Governor of Washington in 1980, but ultimately did not win the Republican nomination.

Chapman was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the position of Director of the United States Census Bureau and served in that role from 1981 until 1983. Between 1983 and 1985 he was Deputy Assistant to President Reagan and Director of the White House Office of Planning and Evaluation. From 1985 to 1988 he served in the appointed position of United States Ambassador to the United Nations International Organizations in Vienna. His portfolio included nuclear proliferation, refugees, economic development, and the control of narcotics.

==Intelligent design==
From 1988 to 1990, Chapman was a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.
Chapman left the Hudson Institute in 1990 and cofounded the Discovery Institute along with George Franklin Gilder in 1991.

The institute is best known as the hub of the pseudoscientific Intelligent design movement, and also focuses on a broad range of issues, including: economics, transportation, technology, and citizen leadership. In 2011 Chapman became chairman of the Discovery Institute.

<text>Biosolids are solid organic matter recovered from a sewage treatment process and used as fertilizer. In the past, it was common for farmers to use animal manure to improve their soil fertility. In the 1920s, the farming community began also to use sewage sludge from local wastewater treatment plants. Scientific research over many years has confirmed that these biosolids contain similar nutrients to those in animal manures. Biosolids that are used as fertilizer in farming are usually treated to help to prevent disease-causing pathogens from spreading to the public. Some sewage sludge can not qualify as biosolids due to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals, radionuclides, and heavy metals at levels sufficient to contaminate soil and water when applied to land.

== Terminology ==

Biosolids may be defined as organic wastewater solids that can be reused after suitable sewage sludge treatment processes leading to sludge stabilization, such as anaerobic digestion and composting.

Alternatively, the definition of biosolids may be restricted by local regulations to wastewater solids only after those solids have completed a specified treatment sequence and have concentrations of pathogens and toxic chemicals below specified levels.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines the two terms – sewage sludge and biosolids – in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 503 as follows: &quot;Sewage sludge&quot; refers to the solids separated during the treatment of municipal wastewater (including domestic septage). In contrast, &quot;biosolids&quot; refers to treated sewage sludge that meets the EPA pollutant and pathogen requirements for land application and surface disposal. A similar definition has been used internationally, for example, in Australia.

Use of the term &quot;biosolids&quot; may officially be subject to government regulations. However, informal use describes a broad range of semi-solid organic products from sewage or sewage sludge. This could include any solids, slime solids or liquid slurry residue generated during the treatment of domestic wastewater including, scum and solids removed during primary, secondary or advanced treatment processes. Materials that do not conform to the regulatory definition of &quot;biosolids&quot; can be given alternative terms like &quot;wastewater solids.&quot;

== Characteristic ==

=== Quantities ===
Approximately 7.1 million dry tons of biosolids were generated in 2004 at approximately 16,500 municipal wastewater treatment facilities in the United States.

In the United States, as of 2013 about 55% of sewage solids are used as fertilizer. Challenges faced when increasing the use of biosolids include the capital needed to build anaerobic digesters and the complexity of complying with health regulations. There are also new concerns about micropollutions in sewage (e.g. environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants), which make the process of producing high quality biosolids complex. Some municipalities, states or countries have banned the use of biosolids on farmland.

=== Nutrients ===
Encouraging agricultural use of biosolids is intended to prevent filling landfills with nutrient-rich organic materials from the treatment of domestic sewage that might be recycled and applied as fertilizer to improve and maintain productive soils and stimulate plant growth. Biosolids can be an ideal agricultural conditioner and fertilizer which can help promote crop growth to feed the increasing population. Biosolids may contain macronutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur with micronutrients copper, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron, boron, molybdenum and manganese.

=== Industrial and man-made contaminants ===
Biosolids contains synthetic organic compounds, radionuclides and heavy metals. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set numeric limits for arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc but has not regulated dioxin levels.

Contaminants from pharmaceuticals and personal care products and some steroids and hormones may also be present in biosolids. Substantial levels of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) polybrominated diphenyl ethers were detected in biosolids in 2001.

The United States Geological Survey analyzed in 2014 nine different consumer products containing biosolids as a main ingredient for 87 organic chemicals found in cleaners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. These analysis detected 55 of the 87 organic chemicals measured in at least one of the nine biosolid samples, with as many as 45 chemicals found in a single sample.

In 2014, the City of Charlotte, North Carolina, discovered extreme levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in their biosolids after being alerted by that illegal PCB dumping was taking place at regional waste water treatment plants across the state.

Biosolids land application in South Carolina was halted in 2013 after an emergency regulation was enacted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) that outlawed any PCB contaminated biosolids from being land applied regardless if Class A or Class B. Very soon thereafter, SCDHEC expanded PCB fish consumption advisories for nearly every waterway bordering biosolids land application fields.

In 2019, the state of Maine found that 95% of sewage sludge produced in the state contained unsafe levels of Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals. Several farms that had spread biosolids as fertilizer were found to have PFAS contaminated soil, groundwater, animals and crops. Hundreds of other farms were potentially similarly contaminated. The state subsequently imposed additional rules restricting biosolids spreading. In 2023, Arturo A. Keller at the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management within the University of California, Santa Barbara began working on solutions to eliminate these PFAS, including creating bio-char fertilizers from the bio-solids.

Biosolids used as a fertilizer have resulted in PFAS contamination of beef raised in Michigan.

In October 2021 EPA announced the PFAS Strategic Roadmap which includes risk assessment for PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) in biosolids.

=== Pathogens ===
In the United States the EPA mandates certain treatment processes designed to significantly decrease levels of certain so-called indicator organisms, in biosolids. These include, &quot;...operational standards for fecal coliforms, &quot;Salmonella&quot; sp. bacteria, enteric viruses, and viable helminth ova.&quot;

However, the US-based Water Environment Research Foundation has shown that some pathogens do survive sewage sludge treatment.

EPA regulations allow only biosolids with no detectable pathogens to be widely applied; those with remaining pathogens are restricted in use.

== Different types of biosolids ==
# Anaerobic Digestion: Micro-organisms decompose the sludge in the absence of oxygen either at mesophilic (at 35 °C) or thermophilic (between 50° and 57 °C) temperatures.
# Aerobic Digestion: Micro-organisms decompose the sludge in the presence of oxygen either at ambient and mesophilic (10 °C to 40 °C) or auto-thermal (40 °C to 80 °C) temperatures.
# Composting: A biological process where organic matter decomposes to produce humus after the addition of some dry bulking material such as sawdust, wood chips, or shredded yard waste under controlled aerobic conditions.
# Alkaline Treatment: The sludge is mixed with alkaline materials such as lime or cement kiln dust, or incinerator fly ash and maintained at pH above 12 for 24 hours (for Class B) or at temperature 70 °C for 30 minutes (for Class A).
# Heat Drying: Either convention or conduction dryers are used to dry the biosolids
# Dewatering: The separation of the water from biosolids is done to obtain a semi-solid or solid product by using a dewatering technologies (centrifuges, belt filter presses, plate and frame filter presses, and drying beds and lagoons).

== Different General &amp; Land Applications of Biosolids ==

* Agriculture - Biosolids as an alternative to Chemical Fertilizers
** Biosolids are similar to animal manure in that they consist of various nutrients and organic materials that support the growth of crops, while also enriching the soil and enhancing its capacity to retain water.
** Nutrifor is the brand name of a Biosolid created by Metro Vancouver, Canada, by using biosolids recovered from advanced water treatments. This substance undergoes a process of high-temperature treatment and decomposition by microorganisms to eradicate detrimental bacteria and diminish unpleasant smells. The final outcome is a nutrient-rich, soil-like substance that can be applied directly onto the ground as a fertilizer or incorporated into soil composition.
** The Halton Region, in Ontario, Canada, has introduced a Biosolids Recycling Program where Biosolids are extracted from Halton&#x27;s 7 wastewater treatment facilities and are recycled as an agricultural fertilizer and soil conditioner. They follow The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) quality and safety standards for Biosolids processing and re-use. On average, The Halton region has produced over 35,000 tonnes of biosolids per year.
* Forestry
** Biosolids have been identified to accelerate the growth of timber, which facilitates a faster and more effective growth of a forests. The Regional District of Nanaimo, in BC, Canada, has introduced a award-winning Biosolids management program called Forest Fertilization Program, through which the created biosolids have the potential to enhance the growth of trees in areas with limited nutrients, all the while aligning land utilization practices with forestry activities and recreational pursuits.
* Soil Remediation
** Biosolids have proven effective in promoting the growth of sustainable vegetation, mitigating the presence of harmful substances in soil, managing soil erosion, and revitalizing soil profiles for compromised areas which in turn is crucial for the rehabilitation of sites lacking adequate topsoil.
** The Regional District of Nanaimo in partnership with Nanaimo Forest Products Ltd. have introduced a Soil Fabrication Program to manufacture soil at the Harmac Mill in Duke Point, British Columbia, Canada. This is also a planned contingency site for GNPCC biosolids
* Lawns and Home Gardens
** The United States Environmental Protection Agency mentions that biosolids that adhere to the most rigorous standards for reducing pollutants, pathogens, and attractiveness to vectors can be bought by individuals from hardware stores, home and garden centers, or directly from their community&#x27;s wastewater treatment facility.
* Biogas as an alternative Power Source
** The City of Barrie, in Ontario, Canada has partnered with a Consulting Engineering Firm to convert and optimize Biogas obtained from the Biosolids from their local Wastewater Treatment Facility (WwTF) and to use this Biogas generated from anaerobic digesters as power source for the facility&#x27;s two cogeneration (cogen) engines and boilers.
** The City of Hamilton, in Ontario, Canada also has a similar Master Plan for the Biosolids present in the city&#x27;s Wastewater treatments. In their master plan for the next 20 years, they aim to reduce Biosolids Management and foster the use of the produced Biogas for energy production through co-generation.

In a publication by the Government of Canada and the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, the author mentions that using the Land Application method of Biosolids is more cost-effective to taxpayers as compared to the alternative methods of management such as disposal in a landfill.

== Classification systems ==

=== United States ===
In the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 503 governs the management of biosolids. Within that federal regulation biosolids are generally classified differently depending upon the quantity of pollutants they contain and the level of treatment they have been subjected to (the latter of which determines both the level of vector attraction reduction and the level of pathogen reduction). These factors also affect how they may be disseminated (bulk or bagged) and the level of monitoring oversight which, in turn determines where and in what quantity they may be applied. The National Organic Program prohibits the use of biosolids in farming certified organic crops.

===European Union===
The European Union (EU) was the first to issue regulations for biosolids land application; this aimed to put a limit to the pathogen and pollution risk. These risks come from the fact that some metabolites remain intact after waste water treatment processes. Debates over biosolid use vary in severity across the EU.

===New Zealand===
In 2003, the Ministry for the Environment and the New Zealand Water &amp; Wastes Association produced the document &quot;Guidelines for the safe application of biosolids to land in New Zealand.&quot; In the document, biosolids were defined as &quot;sewage sludges or sewage sludges mixed with other materials that have been treated and/or stabilised to the extent that they are able to be safely and beneficially applied to land... [and noted that they] have significant fertilising and soil conditioning properties as a result of the nutrients and organic materials they contain.&quot;

A New Zealand scientist, Jacqui Horswell later led collaborative research by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research, Scion, Landcare Research and the Cawthron Institute into the management of waste, in particular biosolids, and this has informed the development of frameworks for engaging local communities in the process. In 2016 the project developed a &quot;Community Engagement Framework for Biowastes&quot; to provide guidelines in effective consultation with communities about the discharge of biowastes to land, and in 2017 another collaborative three-year project with councils aimed to develop a collective biosolids strategy and use the programme in the lower North Island. When the project was reviewed in 2020, the conclusion was that it had shown biosolids can be beneficially reused.

A research paper in 2019, reported on the management considerations around using biosolids as a fertilizer, specifically to account for the complexity of the nutrients reducing the availability for plant uptake, and noted that stakeholders need to &quot;factor in the expected plant availability of the nutrients when
assessing the risk and benefits of these biological materials.&quot;

== History ==
As public concern arose about the disposal of increased volumes of solids in the United States being removed from sewage during sewage treatment mandated by the Clean Water Act. The Water Environment Federation (WEF) sought a new name to distinguish the clean, agriculturally viable product generated by modern wastewater treatment from earlier forms of sewage sludge widely remembered for causing offensive or dangerous conditions. Of 300 suggestions, &quot;biosolids&quot; was attributed to Dr. Bruce Logan of the University of Arizona, and recognized by WEF in 1991.

== Examples ==
* Milorganite is the trademark of a biosolids fertilizer produced by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. The recycled organic nitrogen fertilizer from the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is sold throughout North America, reduces the need for manufactured nutrients. 
* Loop is the trademark of a biosolids soil amendment produced by the King County Wastewater Treatment Division. Loop has been blended into GroCo, a commercially available compost product, since 1976. Several local farms and forests also use Loop directly.
* TAGRO is short for &quot;Tacoma Grow&quot; and is produced by the City of Tacoma, Washington, since 1991.
* Dillo Dirt has been produced by the City of Austin, Texas, since 1989.
* Biosolids are applied as fertilizer in the Central Wheatbelt of Australia as a recycling program by the Water Corporation.

<text>Michael Laws (born 1957) is a New Zealand politician, broadcaster and writer. Laws was a Member of Parliament for six years, starting in 1990, initially for the National Party. In Parliament he voted against his party on multiple occasions and in 1996 defected to the newly founded New Zealand First party, but resigned from Parliament the same year following a scandal in which he selected a company part-owned by his wife for a government contract.

Laws has also been a media personality, working as a Radio Live morning talkback host and a longstanding &quot;The Sunday Star-Times&quot; columnist.

Laws has held several roles in local government since 1995. He has been elected as a councillor to Napier City Council (1995–1996), Whanganui District Council (2013–2014) and Otago Regional Council (2016 – present), as a member of Whanganui District Health Board, and as Mayor of Whanganui (2004–2010).

==Early life==
Laws was born in Wairoa on 26 June 1957. He moved with his parents to Whanganui where he received his pre-tertiary education at Tawhero Primary School, Whanganui Intermediate School, and Whanganui Boys&#x27; College. His father, Keith Laws, a schoolteacher, became rector (principal) of Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School in Oamaru and then of Scots College, Wellington.

On leaving school, Laws worked at the Whakatu freezing works before entering the University of Otago, graduating with first-class honours in history and won an Otago University sporting blue. He later obtained a Master of Arts from Victoria University. During his time at Otago, he attracted controversy as a key member of a student organisation that supported the 1981 Springbok Tour. He also became a public speaker and captained both the New Zealand Universities and New Zealand debating teams in the early-mid-1980s.

== Member of Parliament ==

Having become involved in the New Zealand Young Nationals (the youth wing of the National Party), Laws worked as a parliamentary researcher for National between 1985 and 1989. Most of this time he spent as a senior researcher and press secretary, including assisting the dissident National MP Winston Peters from 1987 to 1989. In the 1987 election, Laws stood as the National candidate for the Hawkes Bay seat, but narrowly lost to the incumbent Bill Sutton of the Labour Party. In the 1990 election, however, Laws wrestled the seat from Sutton to enter Parliament with a majority of 2,895 votes. In the 1993 election he retained his seat with an increased majority, despite the National Party generally losing support.

=== Departure from National Party ===
Laws never had a good relationship with the National Party&#x27;s senior hierarchy. As a researcher, he had done much of his work for Winston Peters, whom party leader Jim Bolger looked upon with disapproval. Tensions persisted between Laws and Bolger after Laws became an MP, made worse by Laws&#x27; declaration that he would attempt to follow popular opinion in Hawke&#x27;s Bay rather than National Party policy. Laws voted against his party on a number of issues, joining several other dissident MPs to oppose the economic policies of the Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson. In early 1991, he even organised public seminars designed to avoid his government&#x27;s new superannuation surtax policies. The Bolger administration later abandoned the surtax, but Laws earned the ongoing enmity of his colleagues for his stance. He also championed the unsuccessful Death with Dignity Bill, which aimed to legalise voluntary euthanasia. The terminal illness of Cam Campion, a fellow dissident in Laws&#x27; first term in parliament, prompted this advocacy.

&quot;Waka-jumping&quot;—where an MP left a party between elections to join another but retain their seat in Parliament—became common during Laws&#x27; parliamentary career and rumours frequently circulated that he planned to join a new party. When Gilbert Myles and Hamish MacIntyre left National to found the new Liberal Party, they invited Laws to join them, but he declined. Later, when Peters was expelled from National and eventually formed New Zealand First, it was reported that Laws had considered changing parties but eventually decided that the new party lacked the organisation and principle for success. Finally, Laws became involved in discussions with Mike Moore, former leader (1990–1993) of the Labour Party, to establish a new centrist party. It did not eventuate, however, with Laws claiming that Moore showed unwillingness to commit to it. In the end, Laws&#x27; relationship with the National Party deteriorated to the point where he no longer attended caucus meetings, and he decided to join New Zealand First in April 1996.

=== Resignation from Parliament ===
Laws had also been elected (in October 1995) as a Napier city councillor. In that role, Laws awarded a contract to conduct a Napier City Council communications poll to a company part-owned by his wife. This appeared to contravene the Local Government (Members&#x27; Interests) Act 1968. Laws claimed &quot;there had been no profit to either company or individuals,&quot; and an official inquiry by the Auditor-General confirmed it found only a minor and unintentional breach of regulations in not declaring his wife&#x27;s shareholding.

However, Laws&#x27; conduct during the matter attracted strong criticism. Laws had claimed the poll had been carried out by a person named Antoinette Beck, who was supposedly based in Australia. It later became known Beck was not a real person, her signature had been applied by Laws&#x27; parliamentary secretary, and that the poll contract had been awarded to Laws&#x27; wife&#x27;s company. After these facts emerged, Laws resigned both from Parliament and the council.

Two of Laws&#x27; principal antagonists in the Antoinette Beck affair—Napier city councillors John Harrison and Kerry Single—unsuccessfully sued him for defamation. Laws defended himself in the Napier High Court in December 1997 and the Court awarded costs of over NZ$200,000 against the joint plaintiffs.

=== 1996 general election ===
Laws remained involved in politics and managed New Zealand First&#x27;s campaign for the general election held on 12 October 1996. He would later write in his political autobiography that the experience resembled nursing a stick of unstable dynamite. Later he served as an adviser to New Zealand First MP and Associate Minister of Health Neil Kirton in the National–New Zealand First coalition government until Kirton was removed as a minister in 1997.

== Local government career ==

=== Mayor of Whanganui ===
Laws was a member of the Whanganui District Council from 2004 to 2010 (as mayor) and from 2013 to 2014 (as a councillor).

In the 2004 local elections, Laws formed and led a &quot;Vision Wanganui&quot; team which captured the majority of the Council seats and unseated the incumbent mayor Chas Poynter, who placed third behind Laws and John Martin. Laws&#x27; administration was controversial: he dismayed the local arts community by cancelling an extension to the Sarjeant Art Gallery, was the subject of a code of conduct investigation after making derogatory comments about some Whanganui residents, and on a radio show he hosted described the deceased Tongan king Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV as &quot;a bloated, brown slug.&quot; Despite complaints, the Broadcasting Standards Authority cleared Laws of any breach of broadcasting standards. &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; readers judged it the &quot;worst insult of 2006&quot;. Later the New Zealand Press Council cleared columns he wrote on peanut-allergy sufferers and on public-school bans.

Despite this controversy, Laws&#x27; &quot;Vision Wanganui&quot; grouping subsequently won two council by-elections in February 2006 and Laws acquired the reputation of having rejuvenated the city and raising Whanganui&#x27;s profile. He also led the campaign for gang patches to be banned in Whanganui. The council held a referendum on that subject in 2007, which was voted in the affirmative, and with local MP Chester Borrows the council sponsored a local bill which eventually became law as the Wanganui District Council (Prohibition of Gang Insignia) Act 2009.

In November 2006, Laws announced he would not contest the mayoralty at the 2007 local elections. He said he wanted to spend more time with his family, especially his young daughters Lucy and Zoe, but did not rule himself out of standing for lesser public offices. However, citing public pressure, Laws changed his mind about retiring from the mayoralty and signed up to contest a second term on the last day for nominations to be submitted. He also stood as part of a &quot;reformist&quot; &#x27;Health First&#x27; team for the Whanganui District Health Board. Laws was successful in attaining both positions, although neither &quot;Vision Wanganui&quot; or &quot;Health First&quot; won majorities.

In his second term, Laws campaigned for the spelling of &quot;Wanganui&quot; to remain unchanged after local Māori, Te Runanga o Tupoho, petitioned the New Zealand Geographic Board to correct the spelling to &quot;Whanganui&quot; with an &quot;h&quot;. The council held a referendum in 2009 showed 77% support for the retention of the then-popular spelling, which had been used since 1837. However, the authority to rename the district rested with the Crown, not the council, and in December 2009 Minister for Land Information Maurice Williamson announced that both spellings would be acceptable but the Crown would adopt the corrected spelling.

Laws announced in June 2010 his retirement from the mayoralty for family reasons.

In the October 2013 local elections, Laws recontested the mayoralty, a councillor position, and a district health board position. He lost the mayoralty to the incumbent Annette Main but was elected as a councillor and to the health board. He resigned from the council in April 2014 to move to Timaru, after taking a position at Craighead Diocesan School.

=== Otago Regional Council ===
In 2016, Laws moved to Cromwell and contested a position on the Otago Regional Council (ORC) in the 2016 local elections. He won his seat in a recount by 5 votes and was re-elected in the 2019 local elections. Laws was appointed deputy chair to new chairperson Marian Hobbs in October 2019 but led a successful effort to replace Hobbs with Andrew Noone in July 2020.

In mid August 2021, ORC chief executive Sarah Gardner lodged a code of conduct against Laws regarding comments that he had made about Council staff in two articles that were published in the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;. One of these stories concerned the Council giving advice to a company that it had taken enforcement action against for illegally dumping waste in the Clutha River. The Council ordered an independent investigation into Law&#x27;s comments headed by Wellington lawyer Steph Dyhrberg. According to Laws, the potential consequences of the complaint included losing his deputy chairman role, being excluded from council premises and functions, and being censured by his colleagues; which Laws claimed would adversely affect councillors&#x27; freedom of speech and expression.

In response to the complaints process, New Zealand Free Speech Union Chief Executive Jonathan Ayling petitioned Gardner to withdraw her complaint and amend the council&#x27;s code of conduct to reflect that councillors represent ratepayers rather than the council executive. They also offered their support to Laws. In November 2021, Laws was cleared of any wrongdoing. According to fellow Councillor Gary Kelliher, the code of conduct investigation against Laws amounted to NZ$20,000 since the Council outsourced it to external lawyer Dyhrberg.

Laws resigned as deputy chair in April 2022 over disagreements with the council&#x27;s 2022/23 annual plan and was replaced by Kevin Malcolm.

In mid February 2024, Laws and four other councillors voted against the ORC&#x27;s decision to continue working on its land and water plan despite the National-led coalition government&#x27;s new directive for councils to delay their freshwater plans in order to accommodate the government&#x27;s new freshwater policids. Laws and fellow Cr Gary Kelliher warned that the council&#x27;s vote could give Simmonds justification to dissolve the council and install government-appointed commissioners. He said the council was playing a &quot;very dangerous game of chicken&quot; with the Government and accused his colleagues of refusing to accept the results of the 2023 New Zealand general election.

In mid March 2024, Laws joined a majority of ORC councillors in voting not to extend half-price bus fares for university students. When University of Otago law student Grace expressed disagreement in her email response, Laws countered that Dunedin ratepayers were already subsidising public buses and accused Grace of hypocrisy and selfishness. Otago University Students&#x27; Association Politics representative Liam White disagreed with the tone of Laws&#x27; response. When questioned by the university student magazine &quot;Critic Te Ārohi&quot;, Laws defended the tone if his response and accused Grace of selfishness and said that &quot;he could have been much harsher.&quot; Following the ORC&#x27;s vote, Laws welcomed the decision not to continue half-price bus fares for university students and said that the new bus fares were subsidised by ratepayers.

In late March 2024, Laws objected to the Otago Regional Council&#x27;s decision to notify its regional policy statement after voting on 32 recommendations from an independent hearings panel during a closed doors meeting. The Council defended its decision to exclude the public from the meeting on the grounds that the hearing panel&#x27;s report and recommendations were subject to appeals. Laws described the decision as &quot;a rushed process with the council being presented with a fait accompli. It seems that local government and open democracy are two foreign concepts.&quot;

In mid-June 2024, the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; reported that Laws had stated that he could not trust advice from former ORC biodiversity partnership lead Alex Foulkes and ORC climate change adviser Francisco Hernandez for allegedly being activists due to their membership of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand. Laws also questioned &quot;whether the Green Party has installed an activist cadre within the ORC staff&quot;. In response, Foulkes had referred Laws&#x27; remarks to the Council&#x27;s communications team and accused Laws of acting unprofessionally and exhibiting &quot;McCarthyism.&quot; Following Foulkes&#x27; departure from the ORC, Laws rejected Foulkes&#x27; criticism, welcomed his departure and stated &quot;that as an environmental activist, he should never have been hired in the first place.&quot;

On 20 September 2024, Laws voted in support of an unsuccessful motion by fellow Cr Kevin Malcolm to pause the Otago Regional Council&#x27;s land and water regional plan until the National-led coalition government released its updated national freshwater management policy statement. Malcolm&#x27;s motion was defeated by a margin of 7 to 5. The Council voted to retain their land wand water regional plan. During the meeting, Laws criticised his fellow councillors for continuing with a plan based on directions by the previous Labour Government. He was heckled by members of the audience in the public gallery. 

On 22 October 2024, the National-led government passed an amendment to the Resource Management Act Amendment Bill preventing local councils from notifying freshwater plans before the Government replaces its national policy statement for freshwater management (NPSFM). This forced the ORC to cancel its scheduled vote on 23 October notifying its land and water management plan. In response, Laws welcomed the Government&#x27;s move, saying that it would &quot;save Otago ratepayers millions of dollars in consulting and legal fees, and bring some much needed political sanity to the regional council table.&quot; The following day Laws joined six other councillors in voting down a motion expressing &quot;deep concern&quot; about legislation passed in the New Zealand Parliament on 22 October preventing the notification of the Land and Water Regional Plan. He criticised the Council for &quot;playing chicken&quot; with the Government, which he said had a mandate to pass its own laws.

== Media career ==
Since leaving Parliament, Laws has worked as a writer, newspaper columnist and talkback radio host.

He joined Radio Pacific in 2003 and changed to Radio Live in 2005. He stayed as a radio host throughout his Whanganui mayoralty, stepping back from his nationwide talkback programme in early 2013. Laws courted controversy in this role, as described above. Additionally, in 2008 he was charged with contempt of court for breaching a suppression order on his radio programme and in October 2010 he called Governor-General Anand Satyanand a &quot;fat Indian.&quot; &quot;Breakfast&quot; presenter Paul Henry had previously made similarly disparaging comments about Satyanand. Laws originally refused to apologise for his comments and only apologised after Henry lost his job over making racist remarks about Indian politician Sheila Dikshit. In 2011, Laws made comments described as &quot;outrageous&quot; about a young man with Asperger syndrome who was arrested for minor theft in the aftermath of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and was suspended from his radio programme after criticising journalists&#x27; conduct in their coverage of the 2011 general election.

On television, Laws has participated in reality television appearances on the second season of &quot;Celebrity Treasure Island&quot; (2003) and the third season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2007). He hosted a weekly rugby television programme on Sky from 2004 to 2009.

Laws had a regular column in the &quot;Sunday Star-Times&quot; and has authored three books: a political memoir, &quot;The Demon Profession&quot; (1998); a mystery novel, &quot;Dancing With Beelzebub&quot; (1999); and sports biography &quot;Gladiator: the Norm Hewitt Story&quot; (2001).

By 2022, Laws had joined The Platform, an online radio station founded by veteran broadcaster Sean Plunket.

== Personal life ==
Michael Laws has five children. The eldest two are from relationships prior to his political career; the youngest three, with former partner Leonie Brookhammer, were born during Laws&#x27; Whanganui mayoralty. Laws and Brookhammer separated in 2009.

<doc id="1142145" wikidata="Q545362" url="?curid=1142145" title="Marsha Norman">
<text>Marsha Norman (born September 21, 1947) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. She received the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for her play &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot;. She wrote the book and lyrics for such Broadway musicals as &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, for which she won a Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical, and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, as well as the libretto for the musical &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and the book for the musical &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;. She was co-chair of the playwriting department at The Juilliard School until stepping down in 2020.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Norman was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the oldest of four children of Billie and Bertha Williams. As a child, she read and played the piano. She later began attending productions by the newly founded Actors Theatre of Louisville. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Agnes Scott College and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Louisville. She worked as a journalist for &quot;The Louisville Times&quot; newspaper, and also wrote for Kentucky Educational Television. She taught young children and adolescents in mental institutions and hospitals. These were perhaps her biggest influence on her writing, especially a 13-year-old girl who influenced her play &quot;Getting Out&quot;. She also taught English at the J. Graham Brown School and Prestonia Elementary School in Louisville.

===Career===
Norman&#x27;s first play &quot;Getting Out&quot; was produced at the Actors Theatre of Louisville and then Off-Broadway in 1979. The play concerns a young woman just paroled after an eight-year prison sentence for robbery, kidnapping and manslaughter. It reflects Norman&#x27;s experience working with disturbed adolescents at Kentucky&#x27;s Central State Hospital.

Norman&#x27;s success with &quot;Getting Out&quot; led her to move to New York City where she continued to write for the Actors Theatre of Louisville. Her full-length play, &quot;Circus Valentine&quot; was produced at the Humana Festival in 1978. The play concerns a travelling circus and its star attraction, Siamese twins. Her next play, &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot;, became her best-known work, given its Broadway success and its star-powered film version. The play brought Norman a great deal of recognition, dealing frankly with the subject of suicide, and won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, the Hull-Warriner, the Drama Desk Award, and the 1986 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. However, her follow-up play, &quot;Traveller in the Dark&quot; received scathing reviews from the New York critics, some of whom were as blunt to say she could not have written it. According to an interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Ms. Norman stayed away from the theater and turned to screenplays, including a 1986 movie adaptation of &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot; that starred Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft and failed to impress critics. She was in high demand in Hollywood, though not always for films that she liked, or that studios would approve.&quot;

Norman wrote the book and lyrics for the musical &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, an adaptation of the Frances Hodgson Burnett novel &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, and won the Tony Award for Best Book in 1991. Her work in musical theatre continued with the book and lyrics for the musical &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, which failed on Broadway in 1993. Her one-act play, &quot;Trudy Blue&quot;, was produced off-Broadway in 1999. That play revolved around a woman who is mistakenly told that she has two months to live. She also wrote the libretto for the musical version of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; which opened on Broadway in 2005, receiving a Tony Award nomination for Best Book of a Musical.

Norman and composer Jason Robert Brown made a symphonic adaptation of the children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Trumpet of the Swan&quot;, which premiered at the Kennedy Center in 2008. Norman has since written the libretto for the musical adaptation of the film &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, with a score by Brown. The musical premiered at the Williamstown Theatre Festival on August 1, 2013, and ran briefly on Broadway from February 20, 2014.

====Television and film====

Norman&#x27;s scripts for television and film include the film version of &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot;. She has written the television films &quot;Face of a Stranger&quot; (1991), &quot;A Cooler Climate&quot; (1999), &quot;Custody of the Heart&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Audrey Hepburn Story&quot; (2000). She has written screenplays for episodes of the HBO series &quot;In Treatment&quot;.

====Other====

Norman has served on the faculty of the Juilliard School in New York City as Co-Director of Juilliard&#x27;s Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program, and was Vice-President of the Dramatists Guild of America. She was honored at the 2011 William Inge Festival for Distinguished Achievement in the American Theatre. She will leave Juilliard at the end of the 2019–2020 academic year.

<text>Donald Towe Jones (January 24, 1932 – November 5, 2004) was an American-Dutch actor, singer and dancer; born in Harlem, he went to the Netherlands in his early twenties and became one of the first Dutch black stars.

==Biography==
Born in Harlem, New York Jones originally trained to be an advertising designer. He moved to the Netherlands in 1954 with a dance troupe. He was hired by a cabaret company and began a career singing, acting, and dancing. He was hired for the very first Dutch television show, the 1950s television hit &quot;&quot; (written by Annie M.G. Schmidt), in which he played Dinky Henderson, who sings the song &quot;Ik zou je het liefste in een doosje willen doen,&quot; a Dutch hit and now one of the standards in the musical comedy genre.

<text>Josep Piqué Camps (21 February 1955 – 6 April 2023) was a Spanish politician of the conservative People&#x27;s Party (PP). He served in ministerial departments under the José María Aznar government. He also helmed the People&#x27;s Party of Catalonia from 2003 to 2007.

== Early life and education==
Josep Piqué Camps was born on 21 February 1955 in Vilanova i la Geltrú, province of Barcelona, the son of local politician José Piqué Tetas. He earned a doctorate in Business and Economics and a Law degree from the University of Barcelona.

==Political career==
===Early years===
In his youth, and during the last years of the Franco&#x27;s dictatorship Piqué was a member of extreme left organization Red Flag, and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia.

Piqué was professor at the University of Barcelona between 1978 and 1986, being the tenured professor of Economic Theory from 1984 to 1986. That year, Piqué was named by Catalan president Jordi Pujol, Director General of Industry, an office he held until 1988 when returned to the private sector.

===Minister of Industry and Energy: 1996–2000===
In view of the 1996 general elections, the leader of the People&#x27;s Party (PP) and of the opposition José María Aznar wanted to improve his image in Catalonia and get closer to the business community and the Catalan bourgeoisie as it was a decisive territory in electoral terms. So in 1995, through the president of the Catalan employers&#x27; association Joan Rossell, he contacted Josep Piqué.
After the electoral victory of the PP, José María Aznar, already as Prime Minister, appointed him Minister of Industry and Energy as an independent politician on 5 May 1996, and was sworn the following day. His main objective as minister, Piqué remarked that day, would be the reorganization of public enterprise, without ruling out privatization, in order to reduce the public deficit. He also referred to the reorganization of the electricity sector.

Piqué was responsible for the privatizations of large public companies such as Repsol, Telefónica, Endesa and Aceralia.

On 15 July 1998 he was appointed Spokesperson of the Government after rising as one of Aznar&#x27;s most trusted men.

In January 1999, he joined the People&#x27;s Party, taking a place in its National Executive Committee. .

===Minister of Foreign Affairs: 2000–2002===
In the 2000 general elections, Piqué became member of the Congress of Deputies for the province of Barcelona.

Aznar appointed him, on 27 April, as the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, stepping down from the two previous positions he held.

In this capacity, he also steered Spain&#x27;s foreign policy during its six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union.

Piqué maintained a clear atlanticist stance and defended Spain&#x27;s coalition with the U.S. government that precipitated the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2006 he admitted &quot;very serious mistakes&quot; in the invasion, although he added that the existence of weapons of mass destruction was a conviction shared by everyone.

In the face of the 2002 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt, Piqué and the Spanish government maintained a position of support to the institutional legality represented by President Hugo Chávez, but did not treat the event as a coup d&#x27;état in spite of having mobilized the Ambassador in Venezuela to hold a meeting with Pedro Carmona. On 15 April he supported the return of Chávez as an &quot;opportunity for democracy&quot; In 2004 Piqué assured that they believed that Carmona, at that time, had assumed the position of President of Venezuela when they were aware of a supposed resignation of Chávez.

===Minister of Science and Technology: 2002–2003 ===
As part of a cabinet reshuffle, he was replaced by Ana de Palacio y del Valle-Lersundi and instead took over the Ministry of Science and Technology, which oversees the telecommunications industry. At the time, he was thought to have paid the price for failing to resolve the protracted dispute with the UK over the future of Gibraltar.

During his mandate, he developed the Internet law and promoted the General Telecommunications Law.

In those years he already began to be considered as a possible successor to Aznar in the leadership of the national People&#x27;s Party, but he was finally sent to lead the People&#x27;s Party of Catalonia.

===In Catalonia===
Piqué became president of the People&#x27;s Party of Catalonia in 2002 and, being a candidate to the Catalan elections of 2003, had the objective of capturing the votes that could be obtained by the ruling Catalanist conservative Convergence and Union party, having maintained a very close relationship with the Catalan establishment. He turned the PP of Catalonia towards a moderate and Catalanist conservative position, further away from the centralism defended by the national PP. In fact, he succeeded in getting the PP to participate in the first negotiations of a new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia.

He resigned from this position in July 2007 after disagreement over the political direction that the central PP wanted to impose over the regional branch.

Piqué was member of the Parliament of Catalonia between 23 December 2003 and 26 July 2007. During this period of time, between 2003 and 2007, he was also senator appointed by the Catalan Parliament.

==Business career==

He started in the business world in the 1980s, when Macià Alavedra introduced him to the circles of the Spanish subsidiary of the Kuwait Investment Authority group. Previously, he had been appointed chief economist in the research department of La Caixa bank, until 1985.

After his time at the General Directorate of Industry of the Catalan government, Piqué returned to the private sector, when he was called by the businessman Javier de la Rosa to become CEO and president of the chemical company Ercros in 1989. Between 1989 and 1992 he also chaired the company Erkimia. Already involved in the important business and economic circles of Catalonia, Piqué was appointed president, in 1995, of the , until 1996, when he was appointed minister of the Spanish government.

Between November 2007 and 2013, Piqué served as chairman of low-cost carrier Vueling Airlines.

In November 2008, Piqué was co-chair of the Global China Business Meeting 2008 in Madrid. From November 2008 until June 2009, Piqué served as member of a six-member panel of EU experts advising the Bulgarian government. Set up by Bulgaria&#x27;s Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev, the advisory board was chaired by Dominique de Villepin and mandated to recommend ways to help the country adjust to EU membership. In addition, Piqué served on the Political Sponsorship Committee of the Institut de Prospective Economique du Monde Méditerranéen (IPEMED).

In 2009 he launched Pangea21 Consultora Internacional, a small firm in Barcelona to provide consulting services and management advice in all kinds of international business.

Piqué was appointed member of the board of directors of Amadeus IT Group in June 2019.

==Personal life and death==
Piqué married gynaecologist Margarita Montaner, with whom he had three children, but they divorced. In 2009, he married journalist Gloria Lomana.

Piqué died at Hospital 12 de Octubre, in Madrid, on 6 April 2023, at age 68. The funeral service was held at the M-30 mortuary in Madrid the following day.

==Recognition==
Piqué&#x27;s oratory was recognized as sharp and brilliant, and he maintained the policy of dialogue, negotiation and moderate conservatism as the axis of his political mood, as well as defender of the autonomic system. He maintained a profile of a discreet and observant politician.

In September 2023, Piqué was posthumously awarded the Premio In Memoriam in the inaugural Premios Vanguardia, presented at the National Museum of Art of Catalonia in Barcelona in 2023 by the King Felipe of Spain.

<doc id="1142161" wikidata="Q1638918" url="?curid=1142161" title="Ordinary (church officer)">
<text>An ordinary (from Latin &quot;ordinarius&quot;) is an officer of a church or civic authority who by reason of office has ordinary power to execute laws.

Such officers are found in hierarchically organised churches of Western Christianity which have an ecclesiastical legal system. For example, diocesan bishops are ordinaries in the Catholic Church and the Church of England. In Eastern Christianity, a corresponding officer is called a hierarch (from Greek &quot;hierarkhēs&quot; &quot;president of sacred rites, high-priest&quot; which comes in turn from τὰ ἱερά &quot;ta hiera&quot;, &quot;the sacred rites&quot; and ἄρχω &quot;arkhō&quot;, &quot;I rule&quot;).

== Ordinary power ==
In canon law, the power to govern the church is divided into the power to make laws (legislative), enforce the laws (executive), and to judge based on the law (judicial). An official exercises power to govern either because he holds an office to which the law grants governing power or because someone with governing power has delegated it to him. Ordinary power is the former, while the latter is delegated power. The office with ordinary power could possess the governing power itself (proper ordinary power) or instead it could have the ordinary power of agency, the inherent power to exercise someone else&#x27;s power (vicarious ordinary power).

The law vesting ordinary power could either be ecclesiastical law, i.e. the positive enactments that the church has established for itself, or divine law, i.e. the laws which were given to the Church by God. As an example of divinely instituted ordinaries, when Jesus established the Church, he also established the episcopate and the primacy of Peter, endowing the offices with power to govern the Church. Thus, in the Catholic Church, the office of successor of Simon Peter and the office of diocesan bishop possess their ordinary power even in the absence of positive enactments from the Church.

Many officers possess ordinary power but, due to their lack of ordinary executive power, are not called ordinaries. The best example of this phenomenon is the office of judicial vicar, a.k.a. &quot;officialis&quot;. The judicial vicar only has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop&#x27;s power to judge cases. Though the vicar has vicarious ordinary judicial power, he is not an ordinary because he lacks ordinary executive power. A vicar general, however, has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop&#x27;s executive power. He is therefore an ordinary because of this vicarious ordinary executive power.

==Catholic usage==
===Local ordinaries and hierarchs===
Local ordinaries exercise ordinary power and are ordinaries in particular churches. The following clerics are local ordinaries:
*The Bishop of Rome (the pope) is ordinary for the whole Catholic Church.
*In Eastern Catholic churches, patriarchs, major archbishops, and metropolitans have ordinary power of governance for the whole territory of their respective autonomous particular churches.
*Diocesan/eparchial bishops/eparchs
*Other prelates who head, even if only temporarily, a particular church or a community equivalent to it. Canon 368 of the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; lists five Latin jurisdictional areas that are considered equivalent to a diocese. These are headed by:
**A territorial prelate, formerly called a prelate &quot;nullius dioceseos&quot; (of no diocese), in charge of a geographical area that has not yet been raised to the level of diocese
**A territorial abbot, in charge of an area, which in mission countries can be quite vast, associated with an abbey
**An apostolic vicar (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic vicariate, usually in a mission country, not yet ready to be made a diocese
**An apostolic prefect (usually not a bishop), in charge of an apostolic prefecture, not yet ready to be made an apostolic vicariate
**A permanent apostolic administrator, in charge of a geographical area that for serious reasons cannot be made a diocese.
*To these may be added:
**An apostolic exarch (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic exarchate—not yet ready to be made an eparchy—for the faithful of an Eastern Catholic Church in an area that is situated outside the home territory of that Eastern Church
**A military ordinariate
**A personal prelate, in charge of a group of persons without regard to geography: the only personal prelature existing is that of Opus Dei
**An apostolic administrator of a personal apostolic administration: only one exists, the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney
**An ordinary of a personal ordinariate for former Anglicans
**A superior of an autonomous mission
*Of somewhat similar standing is the diocesan administrator (formerly called a &quot;vicar capitular&quot;) elected to govern a diocese during a vacancy. Apart from certain limitations of nature and law, he has, on a caretaker basis, the same obligations and powers as a diocesan bishop. Occasionally an apostolic administrator is appointed by the Holy See to run a vacant diocese, or even a diocese whose bishop is incapacitated or otherwise impeded.

Also classified as local ordinaries, although they do not head a particular church or equivalent community are:
*Vicars general and protosyncelli
*Episcopal vicars and syncelli

===Ordinaries who are not local ordinaries===
Major superiors of religious institutes (including abbots) and of societies of apostolic life are ordinaries of their respective memberships, but not local ordinaries.

==Eastern Orthodox Christianity==

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, a hierarch (ruling bishop) holds uncontested authority within the boundaries of his own diocese; no other bishop may perform any sacerdotal functions without the ruling bishop&#x27;s express invitation. The violation of this rule is called &quot;eispēdēsis&quot; (Greek: εἰσπήδησις, &quot;trespassing&quot;, literally &quot;jumping in&quot;), and is uncanonical. Ultimately, all bishops in the Church are equal, regardless of any title they may enjoy (Patriarch, Metropolitan, Archbishop, etc.). The role of the bishop in the Orthodox Church is both hierarchical and sacramental.

This pattern of governance dates back to the earliest centuries of Christianity, as witnessed by the writings of Ignatius of Antioch (): The bishop in each Church presides in the place of God... Let no one do any of the things which concern the Church without the bishop... Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be, just as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. And it is the bishop&#x27;s primary and distinctive task to celebrate the Eucharist, &quot;the medicine of immortality.&quot;

Saint Cyprian of Carthage (258 AD) wrote:The episcopate is a single whole, in which each bishop enjoys full possession. So is the Church a single whole, though it spreads far and wide into a multitude of churches and its fertility increases. Bishop Kallistos (Ware) wrote: There are many churches, but only One Church; many &quot;episcopi&quot; but only one episcopate.&quot;

In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the church is not seen as a monolithic, centralized institution, but rather as existing in its fullness in each local body. The church is defined Eucharistically: in each particular community gathered around its bishop; and at every local celebration of the Eucharist it is the &quot;whole&quot; Christ who is present, not just a part of Him. Therefore, each local community, as it celebrates the Eucharist ... is the church in its fullness.&quot;

An Eastern Orthodox bishop&#x27;s authority comes from his election and consecration. He is, however, subject to the Sacred Canons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and answers to the Synod of Bishops to which he belongs. In case an Orthodox bishop is overruled by his local synod, he retains the right of appeal (Greek: Ἔκκλητον, &quot;Ékklēton&quot;) to his ecclesiastical superior (e.g. a Patriarch) and his synod.

<text>Busto Arsizio (; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the south-easternmost part of the province of Varese, in the Italian region of Lombardy, north of Milan. The economy of Busto Arsizio is mainly based on industry and commerce. It is the fifth municipality in the region by population and the first in the province.
==History==

Despite some claims about a Celtic heritage, recent studies suggest that the &quot;&quot;Bustocchi&quot;″s ancestors were Ligurians, called &quot;wild&quot; by Pliny, &quot;marauders and robbers&quot; by Livy and &quot;unshaven and hairy&quot; by Pompeius Tragus. They were skilled ironworkers and much sought after as mercenary soldiers. A remote Ligurian influence is perceptible in the local dialect, Büstócu, slightly different from other Western Lombard varieties, according to a local expert and historian Luigi Giavini.

Traditionally these first inhabitants used to set fire to woods made of old and young oaks and black hornbeams, which at that time, covered the whole Padan Plain. This slash-and-burn practice, known as &quot;debbio&quot; in Italian, aimed to create fields where grapevines or cereals such as foxtail, millet and rye were grown, or just to create open spaces where stone huts with thatched roofs were built. By doing this, they created a &quot;bustum&quot; (burnt, in Latin), that is a new settlement which, in order to be distinguished from the other nearby settlements, was assigned a name: &quot;arsicium&quot; (again &quot;burnt&quot;, or better &quot;arid&quot;) for Busto Arsizio, whose name is actually a tautology; &quot;carulfì&quot; for nearby Busto Garolfo, &quot;cava&quot; for Busto Cava, later Buscate.

The slow increase in population was helped by the Insubres, a Gaulish tribe who arrived in successive waves by crossing the Alps BCE. It is said that they defeated the Etruscans, who by then controlled the area, leaving some geographical names behind (Arno creek (not to be confused with Florence&#x27;s river), Castronno, Caronno, Biandronno, etc.).

Busto Arsizio was created on the route between Milan and Lake Maggiore (called &quot;Milan’s road&quot;, an alternative route to the existent Sempione), part of which, before the creation of the Naviglio Grande, made use of the navigational water of the Ticino river.

However, nothing is clearly known about Busto Arsizio&#x27;s history before the 10th century, when the city&#x27;s name was first discovered in documents, already with its present name: &quot;loco Busti qui dicitur Arsizio&quot;. A part of the powerful Contado of the Seprio, in 1176, its citizens likely participated (on both sides) in the famous Battle of Legnano, actually fought between Busto Arsizio&#x27;s &quot;frazione&quot; of Borsano and nearby Legnano, when Frederick Barbarossa was defeated by the communal militia of the Lombard League. From the 13th century, the city became renowned for its production of textiles. Even its feudalization in later centuries under several lords, vassals of the masters of Milan, did not stop its slow but constant growth; nor did the plague, which hit hard in 1630, traditionally being stopped by the Virgin Mary after the &quot;Bustocchi&quot;, always a pious Catholic flock, prayed for respite from the deadly epidemic.

By the mid-19th century, modern industry began to take over strongly; in a few decades, Busto Arsizio became the so-called &quot;Manchester of Italy&quot;. In 1864, it was granted privileges by king Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. 

Busto Arsizio continued to grow over the next century, absorbing the nearby communities of Borsano and Sacconago in 1927 in a major administrative reform implemented by the Fascist regime and was only marginally damaged even by World War II (a single Allied airdropped bomb is said to have hit the train station). This respite was given, actually, by the fact that the city hosted the important Allied liaison mission with the partisans, the Mission Chrysler, led by Lt. Aldo Icardi, later famous for his involvement in the Holohan murder case. During the conflict, Busto Arsizio was a major industrial centre for war production, and the occupying Germans moved the Italian national radio there. The Italian resistance movement resorted preferably to strikes and sabotage than to overt guerrilla warfare, since those willing to fight mostly took to the Ossola mountains, but strengthened in time, suffering grievous losses to arrests, tortures and deportation to the Nazi lager system. The names of Mauthausen-Gusen and Flossenbürg concentration and extermination camps are sadly known to the &quot;Bustocchi&quot;, as dozens of their fellow citizens died there. On 25 April 1945, when the partisans took over, Busto Arsizio gave voice to the first free radio channel in northern Italy since the advent of Fascism, at the Church of St. Edward, thanks to Don Ambrogio Gianotti.

After the war, Busto Arsizio turned increasingly on the right of the political spectrum as its bigger industries in the 1960s and 1970s decayed, to be replaced by many familiar small enterprises and a new service-based economy. Today, the city represents a major stronghold for both Forza Italia and Lega Nord right-wing political parties.

Busto Arsizio&#x27;s districts

There are nine districts in Busto Arsizio, these are: Sant&#x27;Anna, San Michele, San Giovanni, Sant&#x27;Edoardo, Madonna Regina, Beata Giuliana, Santi Apostoli, Borsano and Sacconago.

== Historical toponymy ==
The historical toponymy of Busto Arsizio includes the names of streets, squares and places in the municipal territory of Busto Arsizio and their history, both those officially present in the street directories and those that no longer exist or are used only by custom. Not all place names are present, but only those with particular links to the history and events of the town and surrounding area. Also listed are some streets with recent odonyms, but nevertheless of great interest because of the transformations they have undergone over time that have changed the urban context, even though these are relatively recent events.

=== Toponyms that have disappeared ===
This section contains the names of streets and squares that have disappeared due to demolitions or urban transformations or due to simple redefinition of the municipal toponymy.

=== Ancient districts ===
Each of the following &quot;contrade&quot; (districts) corresponded to streets and gates of the town:

==== Contrada Basilica (&quot;Cuntràa Basega&quot;) ====
The Contrada Basilica was one of the four &quot;contrade&quot; comprising the territory around the basilica of St John the Baptist, from which it takes its name (&quot;basega&quot; literally means basilica). In the second half of the 19th century, the chronicler Luigi Ferrario reported the name Porta Milano as the new toponym of the district, since the gate (renamed Porta Milano) led to the Simplon road and thus to the city of Milan.


==== Contrada Piscina (&quot;Cuntràa Pessina&quot;) ====
It was the western quarter of the town. The name derives from the basin used as a drinking trough for animals.

==== Contrada San Vico (&quot;Cuntràa Savìgu&quot;, or &quot;Savico&quot;, or &quot;Suico&quot;) ====
It was the northernmost &quot;contrada&quot; and owes its name to the fact that during the plague epidemic of 1524 it was the district least affected by the disease.

==== Contrada Sciornago (&quot;Cuntràa Sciornágu&quot;) ====
This was the southern &quot;contrada&quot; and the richest one.

=== Streets and squares ===

==== Strada di Sant&#x27;Alò ====
The name of the &quot;municipal road known as Strada di S. Alò&quot; is found in the 1857 Land Register and corresponds to the current Via Federico Confalonieri, which runs westwards from Piazza Alessandro Manzoni. Previously, in the Teresian Cadastre, the street was called Via Vernaschela because of the crossroads, later removed, with Strada Vernasca, while the name of Sant&#x27;Alò is due to the presence of a chapel dedicated to the patron saint of goldsmiths, blacksmiths and farriers, demolished in 1914. The current name of Via Federico Confalonieri dates back to 1906.

==== Piazza dell&#x27;Asilo ====
==== &quot;Strà Balòn&quot; ====
As early as the 13th century, there is evidence of the existence of a Via de Bollono that ran from the Porta Basilica meadow to the Cairora farmstead, in the direction of today&#x27;s Corso Sempione. The toponym does not appear in the &quot;Libro della decima&quot; (Book of the tithe) of 1399, probably because, as Pietro Antonio Crespi Castoldi reports, not all the houses in the village were subject to the tithe, particularly those located along this road axis. The name Via Bollono was retained until the 17th century and continued as far as Buon Gesù. The route of the road is delineated both in the Teresian Cadastre, where it appears with the name Via Ballone, and in that of 1857, where it takes the name of &quot;municipal road from Busto to Buon Gesù&quot;. In dialect, however, the road was called Strà Balòn, taking up the older name. The road continued to be called Strada Ballona until the early 20th century. With the first layout of the Ferrovia Mediterranea (Mediterranean Railway) the road was affected by the crossing of the tracks with its level crossing where it now crosses Viale della Gloria; from 1881 the Milan-Gallarate tramway also ran along the road. From the first decade of the 21st century, the street assumed its current name of Corso XX Settembre.

==== Contrada di San Barnaba ====
This name is found in the land register of 1857 to indicate the current Via Roma, which runs from east to west south of the historic centre of Busto Arsizio, and Via San Gregorio, which runs north from the eastern end of Via Roma to Via Milano. The route of this road is found in the Teresian Cadastre and traced the inner course of the southern moat of the town (which was located along today&#x27;s Via Giuseppe Mazzini). The historian Pietro Antonio Crespi Castoldi, speaking of the minor quarters of the Basilica district, reports that one of these is the Contrada Palearia, which probably coincided with the present Via Roma - Via San Gregorio route. The name Palearia can be traced back to straw (perhaps to houses with straw roofs) or to a Cascina Paleata (straw farmstead), but it could also take its name from the De Palaris family, present in Busto in the 14th century. In the 18th century, Canon Petazzi reported a district called Paiè, which was travelled by processions to reach the church of San Gregorio, probably due to the dialectal contraction of Palearia into Paiè. In the Land Register of 1857, the street, limited to the section corresponding to today&#x27;s Via Roma, is given the odonym of Contrada di San Barnaba, and the name, according to Enrico Crespi, is due to a chapel demolished in 1862 that featured a depiction of St Barnabas. The current name of Via Roma dates back to the time when the Capitoline city became capital of the Kingdom of Italy (20 September 1870).

==== Prato di Basilica (&quot;Pratum de Baxilica&quot;) or Prato di Porta Milano ====
Located outside the ancient town, it partially corresponded to today&#x27;s Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi. It owes its name to the district of the same name that led here. Already mentioned in the &quot;Libro della Decima&quot; of 1399, this meadow was overlooked by the Porta Basilica, the eastern entrance to the village, restored in 1613 by Count Luigi Marliani, then again in 1727 by Carlo Marliani and finally demolished in 1861. In the 1857 cadastre, the name of the area is Prato di Porta Milano (in fact, the road leading to Simplon and then to Milan was accessed through this gate). At the end of 1860, for the celebrations of the feat of the Thousand, the square was named after Giuseppe Garibaldi.

==== &quot;Cuntràa di beché&quot; ====
This was the street, still in existence, that ran westwards from Piazza Santa Maria. It owes its name to the presence, in the square, of the ‘&quot;beccaria&quot;’, a porticoed building used for butchering meat. Its name changed several times over time: first to Contrada del Mercato, from 1876 to Via Alessandro Manzoni and from 1905 to Via Felice Cavallotti, the name it still has today. From 1939 until the end of World War II it took the name Via Addis Ababa.

==== &quot;Strà Brüghetu&quot; ====
This is the name that once identified the present-day via Luciano Manara, which runs southwards from Piazza Trento e Trieste, south-east of the city centre, to Via Ludovico Ariosto. Present in the Teresian Cadastre and in the Cadastre of 1857 (where the road is called the &quot;municipal road of Brughetto&quot;), the road connected (and still connects through today&#x27;s Via Milazzo) the centre of Busto to the Brughetto farmstead.

==== Strada di circonvallazione ====
It coincides with today&#x27;s Via Giuseppe Mazzini and is the road that runs south along the historic centre of Busto Arsizio, following the southern development of the embankment and moat that defended the town. Clearly delineated in the Teresian Cadastre, in that of 1857 it assumed the name of ring road, which later became the San Gregorio ring road due to the presence, to the east, of the church of San Gregorio Magno in Camposanto. The current naming after Giuseppe Mazzini dates back to 1906.

Among the former ring roads was also the present Via Andrea Zappellini, located in the north-eastern part of the ancient village. In the Teresian Cadastre, the layout of this street is very irregular and it connected Prato Savico to the Church of the Beata Vergine delle Grazie. The layout of the street is preserved in the 1857 Land Register, where it appears as a ring road, which also included today&#x27;s Via Alessandro Volta. In 1876 it was called the Re Magi ring road (a name derived from the one popularly attributed to the Porta Savico, a name it retained until the early 20th century. From 1910 the street took its current name of Andrea Zappellini.

==== Contrada della colombaia ====
On today&#x27;s Via Carlo Tosi, in the district of San Michele, a turret still stands, which gave its name to the street, belonging to Casa Tosi, where pigeons were bred in the past, as in similar structures in the area. The name of Via della Colombaia was preserved until the early 20th century, but the current name of Via Carlo Tosi can be found in the 1910 toponymy.

==== Piazza del Conte (&quot;Piaza dul Conti&quot;) ====
This is today&#x27;s Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II. It owes its name to the presence of the still existing Marliani-Cicogna Palace, once the residence of the Counts of Busto Arsizio of the Marliani family.

==== Vicolo della costa ====
This was an alley that opened southwards at the south-western corner of Piazza San Giovanni Battista, present in the Teresian Cadastre and referred to as Vicolo della costa in the 1857 Cadastre. Luigi Ferrario in 1864 also mentions this name. The name remained unchanged until the beginning of the 20th century, but in the toponymy of 1910 the name Vicolo Rauli (Rauli Alley) can be found, from the name of an ancient Bustese family. The 1930 partial town-planning scheme provided for the opening of a street between Piazza San Giovanni and Via Ugo Foscolo, opening up Vicolo Rauli, implemented in 1932 with the odonym of Via Cardinale Eugenio Tosi.

==== Contrada dietro le case ====
It corresponds to today&#x27;s Via Antonio Pozzi and is found in the 1857 Cadastre as the result of the levelling of the moat and the defensive embankment of the village. It runs parallel to the Contrada dei Ratti and in the second half of the 19th century was known as Via dei Giardini and connected to Via dell&#x27;Ospedale. The current dedication to the priest Antonio Pozzi dates back to the early 20th century.

==== Vicolo Fassi ====
This is the current Vicolo Purificazione (Purification Alley), which runs southwards for about 30 metres from Via San Michele in the centre. Its route can be found in the Teresian Cadastre, then in the one of 1857 under the name Vicolo Fassi, the surname of a Bustese family that, as noted by Luigi Ferrario in 1864, had properties in the town, probably some near this alley.

==== Piazza della Fiera ====
It corresponds to today&#x27;s Piazza Alessandro Manzoni and its origin dates back to the 17th century following the levelling of the embankment that surrounded the village of Busto Arsizio to the west. It rises in correspondence with the town gates of Sciornago and Pessina and until 1876 was indicated on maps as Prato Pessina (in the Book of Tithing of 1399 it was &quot;Pratum de Pessina&quot;), in continuity with the ancient name of the adjoining Piazza San Michele. The name Piazza della Fiera (Fair Square), documented since 1876, derives from the presence in this square of the cattle market, a veritable fair especially on the occasion of the feast of St Roch, which was celebrated with the blessing of the cattle at the nearby church of St Roch. The current dedication of the square to Alessandro Manzoni dates back to 1906.

==== Contrada di San Filippo ====
The toponym is found in the 1857 Land Registry to indicate the route of the present-day Via Giuseppe Tettamanti, which runs northwards from Piazza San Giovanni Battista, already present in the Teresian Cadastre. Between 1749 and 1751, the rectory of San Giovanni was demolished and the baptistery of San Filippo Neri, which gave the district its name, was built in its place. In the early 20th century, the street was given the odonym of Via Prepositurale, but already in 1910 the current name of Via Monsignor Giuseppe Tettamanti appeared.

==== Contrada della Finanza (&quot;Cuntràa daa Finanza&quot;) ====
Corresponding to today&#x27;s Via Camillo Benso Conte di Cavour, joining the southern sides of Piazza Santa Maria and Piazza San Giovanni, it was so called because of the presence of the tax and revenue office during the Austrian rule. The current name appeared at the beginning of the 20th century.

==== &quot;Strà Garlasca&quot; (or &quot;Galarasca&quot;) ====
It was the road that connected Busto Arsizio to Arnate (today a district of Gallarate), corresponding to today&#x27;s Via Gioacchino Rossini and its continuation of Via Gaetano Donizetti, which leads into Piazza Alessandro Manzoni, together with Via Quintino Sella, at the church of the Madonna in Prato. The name &quot;Garlasca&quot; is already found in 1399 in the &quot;Libro della Decima&quot; (Book of the Tithe) and also appears again in the Cadastre of 1857. In the topography of the late 19th century, it is found with the name of Galarasca local road, while from the beginning of the 20th century the current names of Via Gaetano Donizetti, for the first short stretch near the town centre, and Via Gioaccino Rossini appear.

==== &quot;Strà Garotola&quot; ====
This is the ancient odonym of today&#x27;s Via Goffredo Mameli, which today connects Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi with Busto Arsizio station. The name &quot;Strà Garotola&quot; can be traced back to the 1920s and derives from the word &quot;garro&quot;, meaning ‘stony river bed’. It was the road that led from the meadow of Porta Basilica to the banks of the Olona river, precisely to the mill of the same name (where during the plague the clothes of the sick were washed).

==== Viale della Gloria ====
This was the name of the avenue that today connects the Cinque Ponti area to the north-western part of the municipality of Castellanza. Since 1860, the layout of Viale della Gloria was occupied by the tracks of the Domodossola-Milan railway and the old station, now demolished.

==== Piazza Grande ====
This is today&#x27;s Piazza Carlo Noè, overlooked by the south side of the old church of Santi Apostoli Pietro e Paolo of . The name Piazza Grande dates back to 1857, when Sacconago was an autonomous municipality and this square was the largest in the town (the new church was inaugurated in 1932). In the first decade of the 20th century, the square was named after Victor Emmanuel II, but in 1931, three years after the annexation of Sacconago to Busto Arsizio, to avoid homonymy with the old Piazza del Conte in the centre of Busto, the odonym became Piazza Umberto Biancamano, founder of the Savoy family. In 1944 it assumed its current name of Piazza Carlo Noè.

Piazza Grande was also the ancient toponym in the 1857 cadastre of the current Piazza Pietro Toselli in the centre of , now a district of Busto Arsizio, but an autonomous municipality until 1928. Like the square of the same name in Sacconago, in 1931 the square, previously named after Vittorio Emanuele II, was dedicated to Emanuele Filiberto. The current name dates from 1944.

==== Prato di San Gregorio ====
This was the name given to the open space in front of the church of San Gregorio Magno in Camposanto, which occupied the south-western part of what is now Piazza Trento e Trieste, outside the south-eastern end of the ancient fortifications. This clearing was present in the Teresian Cadastre, while the remaining part of Piazza Trento e Trieste was occupied by fields. In the 1857 Cadastre, the current layout is outlined, with the entire square already fronted by real estate; Luigi Ferrario named it Piazza di San Gregorio. In the meantime, the vestry board of San Giovanni had purchased a piece of land in the Cassina Scerina near the church of San Gregorio and began the construction of an oratory and the opening of a kindergarten named after Saint Anne with the entrance facing the meadow of San Gregorio, which began its activity in 1860. Between 1859 and 1861, today&#x27;s Piazza Trento e Trieste was named after Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, a name that remained until 1896, when a street in the historic centre was named after Cavour. Regardless of the official toponymy, at least since 1860 the square was commonly referred to as Piazza dell&#x27;Asilo, and this name persisted until the early 20th century. In 1909, the square assumed its current name of Piazza Trento e Trieste. Carlo Azimonti reports another popular denomination of the square, namely Prà Furnè, which is explained by the presence on the square of the Cantoni bakery in Prà Asìli.

==== Strada in Longù ====
This was a road located west of Sacconago and connected this village to Ferno and Lonate Pozzolo. It owes its name to the Latin word &quot;longorius&quot;, meaning ‘long pole’, as it probably crossed woods whose trees were used to make poles.

==== Vicolo Lupi ====
This alley owes its name to the De Lupis family, whose presence is attested in Busto Arsizio from the 13th century. Later, some branches of the family vulgarised the surname to Lualdi. The street took its current name of Vicolo Clerici after the 19th century (it is still cited as Vicolo Lupi in the 1857 Land Register).

==== Contrada della macchina (&quot;Cuntràa dàa machina&quot;) ====
Corresponding to today&#x27;s Via Solferino, which connects Via Montebello and Piazza San Giovanni, it was so named in 1857 by the surveyors in charge of surveying the centre of Busto Arsizio for the creation of the new Cadastre. The choice of this name derives from the presence of a hydraulic machine, commissioned by the municipal administration around 1750 to combat the risk of fires (which were particularly frequent due to the large number of wooden buildings and flammable materials such as cotton and grain, and were difficult to extinguish due to the dryness of the ground and the great depth of the wells). This machine, operated by hand and possibly later by steam, which was located in one of the buildings overlooking this street, lost its usefulness in 1897, when the new municipal aqueduct designed by Eugenio Villoresi was inaugurated.

==== Contrada del mangano (&quot;Cuntràa dul màngan&quot;) ====
This was the street corresponding to today&#x27;s Via Paolo Camillo Marliani, connecting Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II to Via Montebello. The mangle, from which it takes its name, was the machine used to roll and press fabrics.

==== Vicolo Marchesi ====
This is today&#x27;s Vicolo Gambarana, in the south-western part of the historical centre. The route is present in the Teresian Cadastre and the name Vicolo Marchesi is found in the 1857 Cadastre: it derives from the Marchesi, who held municipal and ecclesiastical offices in Busto Arsizio in the 18th century. The current dedication to Giuseppe Gambarana of Pavia, the last feudal lord of Busto who succeeded Camillo Marliani in 1780, is found in the 1910 topographic maps. Today, the original route has disappeared, replaced by car parks, but the odonym has been preserved in the road bordering the parking area to the south and east.

==== Prato Pessina (later &quot;Prato di San Michele&quot;) ====
An uncultivated piece of land outside the ancient hamlet, where today the Piazza San Michele is located. Like the Contrada Pessina, the name derives from the basin used as a drinking trough for animals that stood in Piazza Santa Maria. Traces of this toponym remain in the name of the church of the Madonna in Prato, a religious building that was built near the said meadow.

==== Strada comunale detta Pobbia ====
It roughly coincided with today&#x27;s Via Arnaldo da Brescia, built following the 1911 Master Plan that provided for the construction of the new hospital in the northern area of Busto Arsizio. The ancient odonym is found in the Land Registry of 1857 and owes its origin to the toponym &quot;Pobega&quot;, already present in the &quot;Libro della Decima&quot; of 1399, which derives from the Lombard word &quot;pobia&quot;, meaning ‘poplar’. In the 1930s, it was given its current name.

==== Contrada dei Prandoni ====
The route of this road, already present in the Teresian Cadastre, corresponds to today&#x27;s Via XXII Marzo, between Via Giacomo Matteotti and Corso Europa, in the old town centre. In the 1857 Land Register there is the odonym Contrada dei Prandoni, confirmed by Luigi Ferrario in 1864 and preserved until the beginning of the 20th century. The name derives from the Prandoni (&quot;De Prandonis&quot;) family, of Milanese origin and traceable in Busto Arsizio around the 16th century. From this street, which assumed its current name of Via XXII Marzo in 1906, originated Vicolo Provasoli, which became the private property of Cinema Oscar in 1955.

==== Stradone Tosi ====
This is a short street that runs alongside the Villa Ottolini-Tovaglieri, on the north-western edge of the ancient village. The street is recorded in the Teresian Cadastre and in the 1857 Cadastre it is called Stradone Tosi as it joins Via San Michele at Casa Tosi. From 1906 its name changed to Via Madonna del Monte as a reference to the Sacro Monte of Varese, and with a resolution of the City Council on 26 June 1964 the name became Via Emilio Parona.

==== Piazza Pretura Vecchia ====
It corresponds to the current intersection of Via Roma and Via Bramante and kept the name of Piazza della Pretura Vecchia until 1910, when the offices of the Magistrate&#x27;s Court moved to Palazzo Marliani-Cicogna, and the square became Piazza Bramante, the name that remains of the street that goes from Piazza Santa Maria to Via Roma.

==== Strada alla cascina Provasoli ====
It corresponds to today&#x27;s Via Goito, which runs westwards from the north side of Piazza Alessandro Manzoni, just outside the city centre. With the route already present in the Teresian Cadastre, this country road appears with the name of &quot;consortium road to the Provasoli farmstead&quot; in the 1857 Cadastre. It later assumed the name of Strada della Marchesina, from the farmstead of the same name, listed by Luigi Ferrario in 1864. In 1906, the current odonym of Via Goito was given.

==== Contrada dei Ratti ====
Its route is now traced by Via Giosuè Carducci and Via Giovanni Battista Bossi, north-east of the basilica of San Giovanni Battista. Contrada dei Ratti is mentioned in the 17th century by Pietro Antonio Crespi Castoldi and is found in the Teresian Cadastre. Its development as a road is also recorded in the 1857 Cadastre. With the building of the Carducci schools (1899-1907), the street was named Via delle scuole, becoming Via Gaudenzio Ferrari before 1910. In the 1920s the street took its current names of Via Giosuè Carducci and Via Giovanni Battista Bossi. The ancient name probably derives from the fact that the area was located to the north of the village and perhaps because at this point the defensive embankment, located about 50 metres to the north, was higher than in other areas of the perimeter of the built-up area (from ‘&quot;ratto&quot;’, an adjective that in archaic Italian means steep).

==== Vicolo Reguzzoni ====
Corresponding to today&#x27;s Vicolo Crocefisso, and present as a route in the Teresian Cadastre, the name Vicolo Reguzzoni can be found in the 1857 Cadastre. It can be entered from Via San Michele in the historic centre of Busto Arsizio and today leads to a car park at the other end of which is Vicolo San Carlo Borromeo. The name derives from that of the &quot;Regizonus&quot; (Reguzzoni) family, a wealthy family in Busto Arsizio since the 14th century. Throughout the 19th century, the street retained its ancient name, but in 1906 it was given its current name of Via Crocefisso, probably derived from a fresco depicting the Crucifixion of Jesus placed in the short stretch and now disappeared.

==== Contrada del Riale (or &quot;Reale&quot; or &quot;delle Monache&quot;) ====
Today&#x27;s Via Bambaia, located a few metres south of Piazza Santa Maria, corresponds to part of the route of the ancient Contrada del Riale, as visible in the 1857 Cadastre. The name Riale is mentioned in 1864 by the chronicler Luigi Ferrario, while in the cadastre it appears as Reale, which may be a mistranscription. The name derives from the dialect word &quot;Riáa&quot; (brook, as also shown by the variant of the name of the stream Rile that flows north of Busto Arsizio) because the overflowing waters of the pool located in Piazza Santa Maria flowed through this street before it was covered in 1631. The popular name of the street was instead Contrada delle Monache because of the presence of a monastery of Augustinian nuns. In 1910 the street was given its current name and after 1930, following the opening of Via Bramante, it was reduced to just the final stretch joining Via Bramante and Via Roma.

==== Contrada San Rocco (later &quot;corsia di Porta Novara&quot;, then &quot;via Novara&quot;) ====
Its route corresponds to today&#x27;s Via Giuseppe Lualdi, which from Piazza Alessandro Manzoni connects with Via Carlo Porta and Via Felice Cavallotti and then enters Piazza Santa Maria. These three streets previously constituted the Contrada Sciornago. The name Contrada San Rocco appears in the 17th century due to the presence of the church of San Rocco. This name is found in the 1857 Land Registry, while Luigi Ferrario in 1864 called it &quot;Porta Novara lane known as Sciornago&quot; (the Novara gate, formerly known as Sciornago gate, was located where the street crosses Piazza Manzoni today). At the beginning of the 20th century it changed its name to Via Novara, but in the 1903 topography it already has the current name of Via Giuseppe Lualdi. In addition to the church of San Rocco, the Bossi house stands here.

==== Via Roncora ====
This street faithfully corresponds to today&#x27;s route of Via Vespri Siciliani, which runs west from the centre of Busto to Veroncora. The road is already mentioned in the &quot;Libro della decima&quot; of 1399 and is found in the Teresian Cadastre and in the one of 1857 with the name of &quot;consortium road known as alla Madonna in Veroncora&quot;, from the church of Madonna in Veroncora located on the western edge of the road&#x27;s route. Around 1920 the current name of Via Vespri Siciliani appeared.

==== &quot;Via Sachonasca&quot; (later &quot;via de Saconago&quot; and &quot;via Sainasca&quot;) ====
Corresponding to today&#x27;s Via Magenta, it is the street that connects the centre of Busto Arsizio to the districts of Sacconago (from which it derives its name) and Borsano, formerly autonomous municipalities, and was the continuation of Strà Garlasca (today&#x27;s Via Donizetti and Via Rossini). The road is documented as early as the 14th century and retained its name until the 17th century. The route is found in the Teresian Cadastre and in the 1857 Cadastre it has the name of &quot;municipal road known as the road to Sacconago&quot;. The current name of Via Magenta appeared as early as the end of the 19th century, limited to the first section up to the level crossing at the intersection with the Novara-Seregno railway, but before 1930 it was extended to the entire route. The odonym of Via Magenta is given by the fact that travelling south along the road it is possible to reach Dairago, Arconate, Inveruno and then Magenta.

==== &quot;Via Samariti&quot; (or &quot;Via Sammarita&quot;) ====
Its route corresponds to present-day Via Mentana and Via Luigi Maino, which run northward from Piazza Cristoforo Colombo (Prato Savico) to Corso Italia, in front of the hospital. The term &quot;sammariti&quot;, which appears as the name of the street in the Book of Tithing of 1399, is a dialect contraction of “Santa Maria”: it is therefore likely that the street was named after the shrine of Santa Maria di Piazza, which can be reached from Prato Savico by taking the present-day Via Montebello, a natural continuation of Via Samariti. In the Land Register of 1857 is found the name &quot;Strada detta Sammarita&quot;, but already at the end of the 19th century the street assumed its present name of Via Mentana (later, in 1927, the part of the street that goes from the hospital to Piazza 25 Aprile assumed its present name of Via Luigi Maino).

==== Via dei sassi ====
This street was located outside the ancient village and led, going north, to the Simplon road. The odonym still survives in the northernmost section of the street, which runs from Simplon to today&#x27;s Viale Stelvio, while the southernmost section coincides with today&#x27;s Via Marmolada and Via Luigi Galvani. The name is due to the fact that where the road used to stand ran the detour, laid out in the 16th century, of the Tenore stream, which, once it dried up due to lack of water, left a stony ground that was used as a road.

==== Strada &quot;ad senterium&quot; ====
The route of this road, already mentioned under the name &quot;ad senterium&quot; in the Book of the Tithing of 1399, corresponds for its southern part to today&#x27;s Salvator Rosa Street, which from Vespri Siciliani Street (then Roncora Street), runs northwest, holding a median route between it and Strà Garlasca. In the 17th century it retained the toponym of &quot;sentiero&quot; and was mentioned by Pietro Antonio Crespi Castoldi. Present in the Teresian Cadastre, in that of 1857 it has the denomination of &quot;municipal road known as the pathway that from Busto Arsizio leads to Verghera&quot;, popularly called &quot;santé d&#x27;á Verghera&quot; (Verghera is today a district of the municipality of Samarate). From 1920 the southern section of the road assumed its current name of Via Salvator Rosa, while later the northern section, which goes all the way to the border in the woods of Verghera, was named Via Tommaso Rodari.

==== Strada Strapera ====
Its route, corresponding to today&#x27;s Via Luigi Settembrini south of Sacconago, was already outlined in the Teresian Cadastre, and in the 1857 cadastre it has the name of &quot;strada comunale della strapera&quot;. This term indicates poorly fertile moorland, and south of this road there was also a Strapera farmstead in the 19th century; the term is derived from &quot;sterpera&quot;, meaning “site of brushwood.” In 1910 the first section (the northern one) of the street was named Via Alessandro Manzoni, and the next section became the &quot;local road known as strapera gesiolo&quot; because of the presence of a religious landmark near the route, but also to distinguish it from another Via Strapera, located a little further north and which retains the toponym to this day. The designation of Via Luigi Settembrini for both stretches dates back to a resolution of the prefectural commissioner in 1931.

==== Strada Polenta ====
Its route corresponds to that of today&#x27;s Via Spluga, which connects Via Quintino Sella and Viale Stelvio between the neighborhoods of San Giuseppe and Beata Giuliana, north of the city center, and then bends west to today&#x27;s Via Aprica. This route can be found in the Teresian Cadastre and the 1857 cadastre. Until the first decades of the 20th century, the street was called a &quot;local road known as polenta&quot;, a term that, given the antiquity of the country road, is to be considered an assonance of the toponym present since the 12th century in the Bustese territory &quot;porenca&quot; or &quot;polenca&quot;, widespread in the Lombard area and derived from the proper name &quot;Pollencus&quot;.

==== Via Vernasca ====
This is the road that from Prato Pessina went westward in the direction of Samarate. Its first section corresponds to present-day Via Silvio Pellico and Via Rimembranze, which connect the center to the monumental cemetery of Busto Arsizio, and then continued along present-day Via Lonate Pozzolo. In the Book of Tithing of 1399 it was mentioned as the &quot;Raconasca&quot;, probably due to the fact that to the west, outside the territory of Busto, it incorporates the road leading from Gallarate to Arconate and then to Inveruno and Magenta (Arconate by metathesis becomes Raconate). In the 17th century the name Via Vernasca appears, probably due to the prevalence of the toponym of Inveruno instead of Arconate (from the Latin toponym &quot;Everunum&quot; → &quot;Everuno&quot; and the adjective &quot;Everunasca&quot;, later contracted into &quot;Vernasca&quot;). In the Land Register of 1857 the road has the name Via Lonate Pozzolo (which it still retains for the stretch from the cemetery to the eastern border of Busto Arsizio). The current naming of the first section after Silvio Pellico dates back to the beginning of the 20th century, and since 1927 this designation has been limited to the western section only, while the eastern section up to the cemetery has become Viale Rimembranze.

==== Strada vicinale del Viazzone ====
Corresponds to present-day Via Bizzozzero and Via Forlanini, which, near the hospital, connect Via Quintino Sella and Via Arnaldo da Brescia. It is found in the cadastre of 1857.

==== Prato San Vico (or &quot;Prato Savico&quot; or &quot;Prà dei Remagi&quot;, later &quot;Prà d&#x27;a pesa&quot;) ====
It corresponds to today&#x27;s Piazza Cristoforo Colombo and is located just outside the ancient defensive embankment north of the historic center of Busto Arsizio, where the city gate of the same name once stood. It was also popularly known as &quot;Prà dei Remagi&quot;, because of a legend related precisely to the gate that stood there, remembered in a high relief, placed there in 1997, depicting the Magi. The name then changed to &quot;Prà d&#x27;a pesa&quot; (meadow of the weighbridge) until 1901, when it assumed its current name of Christopher Columbus Square.

=== Other vanished toponyms ===

==== Selva lunga (&quot;Selva longa&quot;) ====
This was a wooded area located between Busto Arsizio and nearby Gallarate crossed by today&#x27;s Corso Sempione. Luigi Ferrario reports of a trial held on November 5, 1620 brought by the vicar of Seprio against the owners of these lands, who had not complied with the order imposed by the secret council of the village to clean up the area to limit the frequent murders and robberies.

=== Current toponyms ===

=== Streets and squares ===
==== Via Sant&#x27;Ambrogio (formerly &quot;Cantòn Santu&quot;) ====
It is located in the historic center, a few steps from the central Piazza Santa Maria. It is a side street of Via Bramante that takes its name from the chapel of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio in Canton Santo, a building that stood there until the 1930s, when it was demolished to rectify Via Bramante.

==== Via Baraggioli ====
The street is located in the southern part of the district of , once an autonomous municipality. It is part of the &quot;ancient municipal road known as the old one to Borsano&quot;, already present in the Teresian Cadastre. It owes its name to the dialect word &quot;baragia&quot; meaning “barren land.”

==== Via Bellingera ====
Located east, just outside the historic center, this street owes its name to the Bellingeri family, owners of the Bellingera Marinoni farmstead located, until the early 20th century, along this street.

==== Via Bonsignora ====
This street is already found in the Teresian Cadastre, while in the one of 1857 it is called a &quot;consortium road known as alla Bonsignora&quot;. It owes its name to the Bonsignori family, present in Busto Arsizio as early as the 14th century, and this was probably originally a farm road, given the presence along its route of the Bonsignori and Bonsciora farmsteads, which have now disappeared.

==== Vicolo San Carlo Borromeo (formerly &quot;vicolo Provasoli&quot;) ====
This is an enclosed alley (which today leads via a walkway to a parking lot) that opens from Via Giacomo Matteotti. The layout of the alley was present in the Teresian Cadastre and is also found in the 1857 Cadastre as Vicolo San Carlo. The chronicler Luigi Ferrario in 1864 mentions it as Via Provasoli. With a toponymic reordering in 1910 in a religious direction after the erection of the church of San Michele as a parish, it again assumed the name of San Carlo. In 1941, to avoid problems of homonymy with San Carlo street in Sacconago, the street became Vicolo San Carlo Borromeo.

==== Vicolo Borsa (formerly &quot;vicolo del colonnello&quot;) ====
This alley, which starts from Via Montebello just north of Piazza Santa Maria, is found in the Teresian Cadastre, while in the 1857 Cadastre it took the name Vicolo del Colonnello, probably due to the presence of an officer&#x27;s residence. In 1910 it assumed its current name of Vicolo Borsa derived from the Borsa family, one of the oldest in Busto Arsizio, present in the village since the 13th century.

==== Via del Bosco ====
Located southeast of the historic center, it ends at the boundary with the municipality of Castellanza and the current route reflects the one visible in the Teresian Cadastre. The odonym dates back to 1931, but probably traces the previous popular name Boschessa, which also gives its name to the district. This name derives from the wooded area it passed through: in 1883 the presence of a farmstead, no longer extant, called the &quot;cascina del bosco&quot; on the extension of the road in the municipality of Castellanza is ascertained.

==== Via Ca&#x27; Bianca ====
This is the road from Castellanza, passing in front of the Carlo Speroni stadium, to the Domodossola-Milan railway detour, built in 1924, which split its route into two parts (of which the one towards the center of Busto Arsizio, after the level crossing was decommissioned, is now a private road). Its name derives from the presence along the street of a farmstead, visible in the land register of 1857 and now disappeared, with its exterior walls whitewashed in lime.

==== Vicolo Carlinetti ====
This is an unpaved alley that opens, in the middle of the historic center, from Via Giacomo Mattetotti. Its name comes from the nickname given to a branch of the Tosi family of Busto Arsizio. In the 1857 Land Register the name of the small street was Vicolo Tosi, but in 1941, to avoid homonyms with Carlo Tosi and Cardinal Eugenio Tosi streets, the odonym was changed to Vicolo Carlinetti.

==== Via delle Caserme ====
It runs from Via Giacomo Matteotti to Corso Europa in the historic center. The route is present in the Teresian Cadastre and in the 1857 Cadastre it appears with the name Vicolo delle Caserme, a name it kept until 1959 when, following a gutting, the alley became Via delle Caserme. In &quot;History of the plague that occurred in the village of Busto Arsizio 1630&quot; the author states that, at the beginning of the plague wave that hit Busto Arsizio in 1630, the infected were sent to the &quot;case herme&quot;, lodgings for soldiers passing through the village that probably stood near this street.

==== Via del Chisso ====
The toponym is already found in the Book of Tithing of 1399 in the Latin form &quot;in clauxo&quot;, and this denomination was maintained until the 17th century. In the Land Register of 1857 the name changes to the &quot;consortium road known as in Chiosso&quot;. The name is a vulgarization of the late medieval &quot;hortus clausus&quot;, which indicated a small cultivated area for family use enclosed by a hedge or palisade. The street is located southwest of the historic center, near the monumental cemetery of Busto Arsizio.

==== Via Comalone ====
This odonym is found today in the northeast of Busto Arsizio, in an area of fields, but in the past this name was also given to today&#x27;s Fratelli Cervi and Varese streets, which lead westward from the historic center. Comalone Street is already recorded in the Book of Tithing of 1399, where it is referred to as in Capite Maloni, probably derived from the name of the owner or tenant of the surrounding land. In 1929 the easternmost section of the street, from the center to the intersection with Via Corbetta, was named Via Varese, but in 1975 the westernmost section of Via Varese assumed the name Via Fratelli Cervi.

==== Via Daniele Crespi ====
This street, named after the Busto painter Daniele Crespi, connects Piazza Garibaldi and Piazza Trento e Trieste. Already present in the Teresian Cadastre, it was the southward extension of the Prato Basilica (today Piazza Garibaldi) outside the fortifications of the ancient village. It runs parallel to what used to be the Contrada San Gregorio and until 1860 had no documented name (it is not found in either the 1857 Cadastre or the writings of Luigi Ferrario). When in 1860 the charity kindergarten “Sant&#x27;Anna” was opened in today&#x27;s Piazza Trento e Trieste, the street assumed the name of &quot;Via all&#x27;asilo infantile&quot;, which it maintained until the early 20th century (in 1907 the street already had its current name). After the construction of the kindergarten, a votive shrine named after Our Lady was demolished in 1862 to make room for the street, which after two years was rebuilt as the shrine of Santa Maria Nascente at the entrance to Via Daniele Crespi from Piazza Trento e Trieste.

==== Via Santa Croce ====
Located in the heart of the historic center, perpendicular to Via Sant&#x27;Antonio that connects Piazza Santa Maria and Piazza San Giovanni, the route of this street was already present in the Teresian Cadastre and is found in the 1857 Cadastre under the name of Via Santa Croce. The odonym is derived from the existence of a church dedicated precisely to the Cross erected in the second half of the 15th century, next to which was the headquarters of the Confraternity of the Disciplines. In the 18th century the confraternity was suppressed, and in the 20th century the decline of the church began. Reduced first to barracks and then acquired by private individuals, its demolition began in 1971, and in 1973 the remaining part of the religious building finally collapsed.

==== Vicolo Custodi ====
This is a side street of Montebello Street, about 50 m from the shrine of Santa Maria di Piazza. It is a cul-de-sac named after the historic owners of the buildings facing this street: the Custodi family. This family appears to have been present in the village since the beginning of the 17th century with some representatives who made a significant contribution to the social and religious life of the village. Characteristic of this street is the fresco by Carlo Grossi located at its end, above the portal of an old private chapel of the Custodi House and depicting Our Lady of Help with two saints.

==== Via Dante Alighieri ====
At the end of the 19th century, the Novara-Seregno railway was built, and in 1887 the Busto Arsizio Nord station was opened and a freight yard was built further west, between the towns of Busto Arsizio and (the latter is now a district of the former). Thus the need arose to build a road connection between the center of the suburb and the new freight yard on the railway line (now buried). The construction of the &quot;Teatro Sociale&quot; in 1891 accelerated the construction of the road that from Via Giuseppe Mazzini, which marked the southern boundary of the ancient village, leads to today&#x27;s Via Vincenzo Monti passing by Piazza Plebiscito, where the aforementioned theater stands. The current name of the street, which begins at the intersection with Via Roma, appears from the early 20th century.

==== Corso Europa ====
This is the street that goes westward from Piazza Santa Maria to Piazza Alessandro Manzoni and was built to execute the detailed plan for the opening of a connecting street between the two squares. The name Corso Europa was assigned by resolution of the City Council on July 20, 1959, which was later renewed in 1964.

==== Via Ugo Foscolo ====
The first part of the current route, the one furthest north, already appears in the Teresian Cadastre and in that of 1857 corresponds to the beginning of the &quot;old municipal road to Borsano&quot;. With the entry into service of the Novara-Seregno railway in 1883 and the opening of the Busto Arsizio Nord station, the road was extended to the station building, connecting it to the city center. The current name dates back to the early 20th century and also gives its name to Ugo Foscolo Park.

==== Via Fratelli d&#x27;Italia ====
This is the street that runs behind Palazzo Gilardoni, home of the town hall. The southern section, from today&#x27;s Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi and Via Antonio Pozzi, traces the area of the moat and embankment, which in the Teresian Cadastre were already leveled. At the end of the street is the civic temple of the Blessed Virgin of Grace, built beginning in 1710: in 1812 the street was reported to be called the &quot;street of the Blessed Virgin of Grace&quot;. In 1852, in front of the little church, where there was an oratory named after St. Joseph, the building of the hospital was begun, completed in 1859, now the town hall: the street thus assumed the odonym of Via dell&#x27;Ospedale. After the assassination of King Umberto I in Monza in 1900, the street was named after him, while during the period of the Republic of Salò (1944–45) it became Via Aldo Bormida. After the Liberation it was given the name Fratelli d&#x27;Italia street.

==== Piazza San Giovanni Battista ====
It is one of the two central squares of Busto Arsizio, along with the older Piazza Santa Maria, and is named after the basilica of St. John the Baptist. It does not appear in the Book of the Tithing of 1399, where the only square listed was &quot;Platea&quot; (Piazza Santa Maria). The present area belonged to the Contrada Basilica, today&#x27;s Via Milano, which ran from there to today&#x27;s Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi (Prato Basilica), while another road ran in front of the cemetery in front of the basilica. In 1609 the architect Francesco Maria Richini was entrusted with the construction of the new basilica on an earlier church: the cemetery was relocated and in the first decades of the 18th century the layout of the new square was being shaped by the demolition of some buildings in front of the church. The northern side of the square was expanded in 1906.

==== Via vicinale del Lazzaretto ====
This street is located in the eastern area of the district, an autonomous municipality until 1928, and runs alongside its cemetery. The name is due to the establishment along this street of a lazaretto, a structure used to receive the terminally ill during the plague of 1630. Another lazaretto existed in the village of Busto Arsizio, where Ugo Foscolo Park stands today.

==== Vicolo Livello (or &quot;vicolo Trivello&quot;) ====
It opens along Montebello Street, which runs northward from Santa Maria Square. Its route is already present in the Teresian Cadastre, and in the 1857 Cadastre it is found with the name of Vicolo del Trivello. It assumed its present name at the beginning of the 20th century. The name is of uncertain attribution, but it probably derives, both for &quot;livello&quot; and &quot;trivello&quot;, from woodworking tools: artisan workshops probably stood there.

==== Via Maestrona ====
Located west of Busto Arsizio, perpendicular to Via Giovanni Amendola, which connects Busto to Lonate Pozzolo, it owes its name to the presence of the Maestrona farmstead, shown in the 1857 Land Register and located near the border with Magnago. The toponym probably derived from the nickname of the family of the owners of the farmstead.

==== Vicolo Mangano ====
Located between Piazza San Giovanni and Via Solferino, like Contrada del Mangano (today Via Paolo Camillo Marliani) it is named after a textile machine associated with local industry. Such machinery was probably located in a building overlooking this alley and came into operation in the early 19th century. The alley was already present in the Teresian Cadastre, and its present name is found in the 1857 cadastre. Evidence of it can be found until the early 20th century, but then it lost its name. By a resolution of May 15, 1953, the odonym that still exists today was restored.

==== Piazza Santa Maria ====
This is the oldest square in Busto Arsizio, the first nucleus of the ancient village. In the Book of Tithing of 1399 it was the only square in the village and was called in notarial Latin &quot;Platea&quot;. It was overlooked in the past by the dwellings of the wealthiest families in the village, the town hall, the monastery of the Humiliati, as well as the church named after Our Lady and the civic tower. As described by Luigi Ferrario in 1864, there was a rustic portico adjoining the square for the slaughter of livestock called &quot;Beccaria&quot;, which was demolished in 1810 and replaced with a new porticoed building with stores on the ground floor and a theater on the second floor, inaugurated in 1811. This building was torn down around 1930 and its columns were reused for the building of the Crespi house on Andrea Zappellini Street. In the center of the square was the so-called &quot;pool&quot;, a square basin 24 meters on each side and 6.5 meters deep for watering animals, which received water from a detour of the Tenore stream and whose runoff water was used for the discharge of Beccaria&#x27;s waste. This pool was closed in 1631. This pool is credited with the name of the Contrada Piscina and the town gate of the same name. The name of the square derives from the dedication of the church, whose foundation stone was laid in 1517, to Mary, and the church itself is called the sanctuary of Santa Maria di Piazza to emphasize the importance of the church&#x27;s topographical location.

==== Vicolo Mariotti ====
Located in the historic center, it connects Montebello Street to the complex called the Count&#x27;s Residence, located between Vittorio Emanuele II Square and Santa Maria and San Giovanni Squares and completed in 2018. The alley already appears in the Teresian Cadastre, but the current name appears only from 1857. It is named after the nickname &quot;Mariotti&quot; given to one of several branches of the Crespi family as early as the 18th century. This branch of the family was composed of wealthy landowners and influential clergymen; in fact, a document from 1773, the so-called &quot;Ruolo del Personale&quot;, lists the Cassina del Mariotto alla Madonna and the Cassina del Mariotto, both located near the church of the Madonna in Prato. From one of the now-destroyed farmsteads owned by this family comes the 16th-17th century fresco of the Deposition, now preserved in the Civic Art Collections of Palazzo Marliani-Cicogna.

==== Via Giuseppe Massari ====
Going along Via Giacomo Matteotti from Piazza Santa Maria westward, it is the second street one encounters on the left. Already present in the Teresian Cadastre, in the 1857 Cadastre this route has the name of Vicolo dei Massari and retains the route to the present day, although shifted by a few meters, turning, however, from an alley into a street following some gutting that opened a double outlet and assuming the new name of Via Giuseppe Massari Industriale. Although the ancient surname &quot;Massari&quot; exists in Busto Arsizio, the old street&#x27;s naming derives from the noun “&quot;massaro&quot;,” or the person who, in central and northern Italy, worked in a farm without paying rent and shared the harvest with the landowner. From the 1757 Summary it is known that there were four complete dwellings and three portions of a house “&quot;da massaro&quot;” at that time.

==== Via San Michele ====
This is the street that runs from the entrance of the church of San Michele Arcangelo to Montebello Street and traces the course of the northern embankment and moat defending the ancient village of Busto. In the first half of the seventeenth century the moat and embankment were flattened and the straight course of the street was delineated, clearly evident in the Teresian Cadastre and remaining almost unchanged in that of 1857, where the name &quot;Corsia di San Michele known as Contrada di Sopra&quot; is found. From 1876 the naming became Via San Michele, but from 1940 it was named after Italo Balbo, and then retook its present name after World War II.

==== Via Ponzella ====
This is a road located southeast of Busto Arsizio, near the border with Castellanza. In the Land Register of 1857 it is called a &quot;municipal road known as the old one to Legnano&quot; and led to Legnano, and then to Milan, through the Mazzafame and Ponzella farmsteads, in Legnano territory. The Ponzella farmstead, which gives its name to the road, is mentioned in a bequest made by the nobleman Agostino Lambugnano to the church of San Magno.

==== Vicolo Re Magi ====
This is the last alley one encounters on the left when walking down Montebello Street from Santa Maria Square to Cristoforo Colombo Square. Its layout already appears in the Teresian Cadastre and takes the name of &quot;Via dell&#x27;aia grande&quot; in the 1857 Cadastre, due to the presence of a large threshing floor for grain preparation. In the 1910 toponymy, the current name of Vicolo Re Magi is found, a name given to recall the city gate of the same name that stood nearby and was demolished in 1880.

==== Vicolo Rovello ====
This is the blind alley that roughly from the middle of Montebello Street runs westward for 30 meters. The layout of the alley is already present in the Teresian Cadastre and is preserved in that of 1857 under the name of &quot;vicolo dei rovi&quot; (alley of brambles), popularly called &quot;vicolo rovè&quot;, later transforming in the 1910 topography into the present name of Vicolo Rovello.

==== Via Scisciana ====
In the 1857 Land Registry there is a street called &quot;local road known as Scisciana, which ran northward from the road to Fagnano&quot; (present-day Volturno and Gaudenzio Ferrari streets) cutting across Simplon and connecting with the Gerbone road (a toponym still existing on the border with Olgiate Olona). The street was named after the Scisciana farmstead that was located near its route.

==== Corso Sempione ====
It is the road that roughly corresponds to the ancient Roman &quot;Mediolanum-Verbannus&quot; road that connected, already in a period between the end of the Republican era and the first decades of the Imperial age, &quot;Mediolanum&quot; to &quot;Verbannus Lacus&quot;. In the Busto Arsizio area it entered the &quot;Selva longa&quot;, which extended from Gallarate to Legnano. The present Busto route underwent two slight modifications for the construction of the Novara-Seregno railway.

==== Via della Vite ====
The name of this road, located north of Busto Arsizio near the border with Samarate, is reminiscent of the cultivation of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, which was once widespread in Busto territory as well. As noted in the Teresian Cadastre, vineyards in the surrounding area were concentrated in the fields surrounding the villages, which were more populated with farmsteads and therefore better maintained.

=== Other toponyms ===

==== Cascina Brughetto ====

This is a farmstead, still in existence, located south of Busto Arsizio and east of . It was connected to the center of Busto by the Strà Brüghetu, and the toponym &quot;Brughetum&quot; has been documented since the 16th century. In the nineteenth century Brughetto was a cluster of agricultural houses and its name was probably derived from &quot;brugo&quot; (heather), a typical heath plant. Now the cascina Brughetto corresponds to the southern area of the neighbourhood of Sant&#x27;Edoardo. 

==== Cinque Ponti ====
Due to the eastward expansion of the city, which entailed heavy costs for the management of the new level crossings that had come into being, a project was initiated between 1906 and 1907 to move the Busto Arsizio station so as to bring it outside the built-up area, and the present station came into operation in 1924. For the intersection of the railroad and the (then provincial) Simplon road, a massive five-arch overpass was designed, which gave its name to the surrounding area. In 1910 the first contract was started for the construction of the new railway station and underpass structures to the Simplon road as well as overpasses to the other roads affected by the passage of the new rail route. Due to problems with the state budget caused by the Italo-Turkish War and World War I, work was halted, only to slowly resume in 1914. With the outbreak of war, work was again interrupted and resumed in 1919, uninterrupted until its completion.

==== Veroncora ====
Veroncora (or Veroncola) is the name of a locality on the northeastern outskirts of Busto Arsizio, not far from the border with . According to some local historians, the name &quot;Verònca&quot; was already in use in the 14th century, and is said to derive from an adaptation of the dialectal phrase &quot;ves&#x27;ai ronchi&quot;, meaning “toward the woods.” In 1639, documents attest to the presence of the church of the Madonna in Veroncora, which still exists today, at the junction of the two roads.

==Demographics==
==Main sights==

The most important buildings of the city are the churches. There are several built in the last millennium, many of which are reconstructions of former churches.

===The shrine of Santa Maria di Piazza===

The most remarkable building of the Renaissance period – indeed the only remaining – is the shrine of Santa Maria di Piazza (&quot;Saint Mary of the Square&quot;), also called shrine of the Beata Vergine dell&#x27;Aiuto (&quot;Blessed Virgin of the Help&quot;). The building stands in the city centre. It was built between 1515 and 1522. The village of Crespi d&#x27;Adda, built up for Cristoforo Benigno Crespi, is home to a smaller version of the shrine.

===The church of Saint John the Baptist===
The church of Saint John the Baptist, in the city centre, was built between 1609 and 1635 by Francesco Maria Ricchini, but the bell tower is older (between 1400 and 1418). The façade, finished in 1701 by Domenico Valmagini, has many statues and decorations. In the interior are numerous paintings by Daniele Crespi, a celebrated painter born at Busto Arsizio, such as &quot;Cristo morto con San Domenico&quot; and Biagio Bellotti. The square in front of this church was built over the ancient cemetery.

===The church of Saint Michael the Archangel===

The third biggest church in the city is the Church of Saint Michael Archangel (). Its bell tower, built in the 10th century, is the oldest building in Busto Arsizio; originally it was part of a Lombard fortification. The present church was built by the architect Francesco Maria Richini. In the church there are some relics, the most important of which is the body of San Felice Martire.

===The church of Saint Roch===
Built after the 1485 bubonic plague and dedicated to Saint Roch, invoked against the plague, it was rebuilt from 1706 to 1713 thanks to donations by the lawyer Carlo Visconti. Inside the church, there are frescos by Salvatore and Francesco Maria Bianchi (1731) and Biagio Bellotti.

===Museum of Textiles and Industry===
The Museum of Textiles and Industry was officially inaugurated in 1997 after years of restoration, and its collections are representative of Busto&#x27;s economical history. They explain how the city developed from a small agricultural village to a thriving, industrial centre of manufacturing and commerce in a few decades.

==Culture==
===Traditions and festivals===
The patron saints of the city are Saint John the Baptist and Saint Michael the Archangel, whose feasts are traditionally celebrated on 24 June and 29 September.

In recent times the city council has given also civic relevance to celebrations that up to now were almost completely of a religious kind. In winter, the burning of the Giöbia (historical spelling: &quot;Gioeubia&quot;) a (usually) female puppet, symbolizing the &quot;chasing&quot; out of winter and its troubles, and on a more sinister note, the change from a matriarchal to a patriarchal society in ancient times, is an established tradition since time immemorial. In the past each family prepared its simple puppet to be burnt, and then its ashes were dispersed to fertilize the fields as a good omen. Now the celebration is more organized and publicly supported but still heartily felt by the populace. Busto Arsizio has two carnival masks, called &quot;Tarlisu&quot; and &quot;Bumbasina&quot; from the name of typical textiles.

===Cuisine===

Originating from Busto Arsizio are &quot;bruscitti&quot;, which consist in a braised meat dish cut very thin and cooked in wine and fennel seeds, historically obtained by stripping leftover meat.

== Economy ==

According to Fitch, in 2009 GDP was 20% higher than the European average, while unemployment was at 4%.

Agriculture

The terrain of Busto Arsizio has never been particularly favourable for agriculture, for this reason from the very beginning the inhabitants of the city added to it other activities, such as leather tanning. Despite this, the primary sector remained the predominant one until the 16th century. The most important crop was that of cereals. Silkworm breeding was also practised for a long time.

Craftsmanship

In the 16th century, Busto Arsizio was known for the production of moleskin. Pewter processing is also widespread in the city, aimed at the production of trophies, trays and plates.

Industry

Busto Arsizio has been one of the major textile centres of Italy for many years and well known abroad. The city birthed a new class of entrepreneurs who started the first textile factors. Also, a new role in society was created: the worker-peasant, who found employment in these factories without completely neglecting agricultural activities. The city began to be called &#x27;the Manchester of Italy&#x27; or &#x27;the city of 100 chimneys&#x27;.

Services

In 1873 Eugenio Cantoni, Pasquale Pozzi and other entrepreneurs linked to the cotton industry founded the Banca of Busto Arsizio, which was transformed in 1911 into the Italian Provincial Credit Society, a forerunner of Italian Discount Bank, one of the main Italian credit institutions in the years of the First World War.

<text>Joseph Dominick Andruzzi (born August 23, 1975) is an American former professional football player who was a guard in the National Football League (NFL).

==Early life and education==
Andruzzi was born in Brooklyn and played high school football at Tottenville High School in the Huguenot neighborhood of Staten Island, where his classmates included former Major League Baseball All-Star starting pitcher Jason Marquis and former National Football League player Adewale Ogunleye with the Miami Dolphins and Chicago Bears

Andruzzi played college football at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he majored in special education. He played every position on the offensive line and started all four years. Andruzzi was a Division II All-American his junior and senior years as well as an offensive team captain during his senior season.

==Professional career==
In 1997, Andruzzi was picked up as an undrafted rookie free agent by the Green Bay Packers. He was allocated by the Packers in February 1998 to play football in Scotland in the NFL Europe league. Andruzzi was released from the Packers after three seasons. He was then signed by the New England Patriots in 2000, where he played five seasons and earned three Super Bowl rings.

After becoming a free agent in 2005, he rejoined former Patriots defensive coordinator and new head coach Romeo Crennel in Cleveland, signing a 4-year deal worth $9 million. He was released two years later while the team brought in Eric Steinbach on a $49 million deal from the Bengals.

In recognition of his contributions, Andruzzi received the Ed Block Courage Award in 2002 and the first Ron Burton Community Service Award in 2003.

==Philanthropy==
In 2001, Andruzzi and his wife, Jen, were introduced to C.J. Buckley, who had an inoperable brain tumor. The families became very close and, therefore, it was devastating when C.J. died late in 2002. The couple launched the C.J. Buckley Brain Cancer Research Fund at Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital in Boston.

On May 30, 2007, Andruzzi was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s Burkitt lymphoma, predicted to double in size in just 24 hours. The family relocated back to New England where Andruzzi had an aggressive form of chemotherapy treatment over three months at Dana–Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital. Andruzzi&#x27;s last treatment was on August 6, 2007, and he then spent the following year at home in recovery.

After completing treatment, the Andruzzi family founded the Joe Andruzzi Foundation in 2008. They are committed to tackling cancer&#x27;s impact by providing financial assistance for patients and their families as well as funding pediatric brain cancer research. Andruzzi received the 2015 Man of the Year award from the Walter Camp Football Foundation.

==Personal life==
Andruzzi has three brothers, each of whom are members of the New York City Fire Department who responded to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. During pregame introductions at the next game on September 23, Andruzzi ran out with an American flag in each hand. His brothers were honored at midfield prior to kickoff.

On April 15, 2013, Andruzzi&#x27;s foundation was hosting an event at a restaurant on Boylston Street in Boston when the Boston Marathon bombing occurred; the second bomb detonated directly outside the restaurant. In the aftermath, he was photographed carrying an injured woman. Andruzzi&#x27;s friend, former Patriots linebacker Matt Chatham, was also present, and uninjured.

<doc id="1142193" wikidata="Q1226642" url="?curid=1142193" title="Groans of the Britons">
<text>The Groans of the Britons () is the final appeal made between 446 and 454 by the Britons to the Roman military for assistance against Pict and Scot raiders. The appeal is first referenced in Gildas&#x27; 6th-century &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;; Gildas&#x27; account was later repeated in chapter 13 of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;. According to Gildas, the message was addressed to &quot;Agitius&quot;, who is generally identified with the general Flavius Aetius. The collapsing Western Roman Empire had few military resources to spare during its decline, and the record is ambiguous on what the response to the appeal was, if any. According to Gildas and various later medieval sources, the failure of the Roman armies to secure Britain led the Britons to invite Anglo-Saxon mercenaries to the island, precipitating the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.

==Message==
The message is recorded by Gildas in his &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;, written in the second quarter of the sixth century and much later repeated by Bede. According to these sources, it was a last-ditch plea to &quot;Agitius&quot; for assistance. Agitius is generally identified as Aetius, of the Western Roman Empire who spent most of the 440s fighting insurgents in Gaul and Hispania. The Roman Britons had been beset by raids by the Picts and Scots from northern Britain, who were able to pillage far to the south after the Roman armies had withdrawn from the island in 407.

Gildas refers to Agitius as &quot;Thrice Consul&quot;. If Gildas meant Flavius Aetius, and he was quoting the letter, it would imply that the letter was sent during the time period of his third consulship in 446. If, however, he was using &quot;Thrice Consul&quot; as a means of identifying a famous leader, the letter may have been sent during either of his three consulships: 432, 437, or 446. Leslie Alcock has raised a tentative possibility of the &quot;Agitius&quot; to whom the &quot;gemitus&quot; is directed actually being Aegidius—though he was never consul. This identification was supported by Stephen Johnson, but rejected by J. N. L. Myres. Miller left the possibility open. The usurper Constantine III had taken the last Roman troops from Britain in 407 and the civilian administration had been expelled by the natives a little later, leaving the inhabitants to fend for themselves during increasingly fraught times. Parts of the plea were recorded: 

The Romans, however, could not assist them, so the Britons were left to their own devices.

==Problems of interpretation==

A second visit in around 446–7 by Germanus, a former Roman general who had become Bishop of Auxerre, recorded in his &quot;Vita&quot; by Constantius of Lyon, could have reflected Aetius&#x27; response to the message.

The reference to Aetius&#x27; third consulship (446) is useful in dating the increasing strife in Britain during this period. Gildas&#x27; mention of the appeal is a minor part of a much larger religious polemic, however, which means that the image described may be more hyperbolic than realistic, especially as his sources were probably derived from oral tradition. The traditional picture of Romano-British society in post-Roman Britain as besieged and chaotic is also being increasingly challenged by archaeological evidence which indicates a definitive series of migrations into England on the part of the Saxons. 

The viewpoint of Gildas is coloured by his classicising rather than monastic education, based at some remove on the Roman education of a &quot;rhetor&quot;, a source of his elaborated and difficult Latin.

Gildas&#x27; narrative describes the Britons as being too impious and plagued by infighting to fend off the Saxons. They managed some successes against the invaders when they placed their faith in God&#x27;s hands, but they were usually left to suffer greatly. Gildas mentions a &quot;proud tyrant&quot; who Bede names as Vortigern as the person who originally invited Germanic mercenaries to defend the borders. 

No answer is recorded to the pleas of the British. There was an increasing Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries and increasing Anglo-Saxon culture, including language.

<text>The Onoghurs, Onoğurs, or Oğurs (Ὀνόγουροι, Οὔρωγοι, Οὔγωροι; Onογurs, Ογurs; &quot;ten tribes&quot;, &quot;tribes&quot;) were a group of Turkic nomadic equestrians who flourished in the Pontic–Caspian steppe and the Volga region between 5th and 7th century, and spoke an Oghuric language.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Onoğur&quot; is widely thought to derive from &quot;On-Oğur&quot; &quot;ten Oğurs (tribes)&quot;. Modern scholars consider Turkic terms for tribe &quot;oğuz&quot; and &quot;oğur&quot; to be derived from Turkic &quot;*og/uq&quot;, meaning &quot;kinship or being akin to&quot;. The terms initially were not the same, as &quot;oq/ogsiz&quot; meant &quot;arrow&quot;, while &quot;oğul&quot; meant &quot;offspring, child, son&quot;, &quot;oğuš/uğuš&quot; was &quot;tribe, clan&quot;, and the verb &quot;oğša-/oqša&quot; meant &quot;to be like, resemble&quot;. The modern name of &quot;Hungary&quot; (see name of Hungary) is usually believed to be derived from On-Oğur (&gt; (H)Ungari).

==Language==

The Onoghuric or Oghuric languages are a branch of the Turkic languages. Some scholars suggest Hunnic had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and refer to this extended Oghuric grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words and personal names. Scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable.

Chuvash language is agglutinative in the structure of grammar, phonetically it is synharmonic. Some scholars consider the Chuvash as the sole living representative of Volga Bulgar language. while others support the idea that Chuvash is another distinct Oghur Turkic language. Chuvash is sometimes considered to share a linguistic connection with the Khazar language although the classification of Khazar language debated among scholars. Chuvash has two to three dialects. Chuvash language is agglutinative in the structure of grammar, phonetically it is synharmonic. In this respect, it&#x27;s almost no different from other Turkic languages. Oghuric family is distinguished from the rest of the Turkic family by sound changes and it has a special place.

The Oghuric languages are also known as &quot;-r Turkic&quot; because the final consonant in certain words is &quot;r&quot;, not &quot;z&quot; as in Common Turkic. - - - . Hence the name &quot;Oghur&quot; corresponds to &quot;Oghuz&quot; &quot;tribe&quot; in Common Turkic. Other correspondences are Com. &quot;š&quot; : Oghur &quot;l&quot; (&quot;tâš&quot; : &quot;tâl&quot;, &#x27;stone&#x27;); &quot;s&quot; &gt; &quot;š&quot;; &quot;*č&quot; &gt; &quot;ś&quot;; &quot;k/q&quot; &gt; &quot;ğ&quot;; &quot;y&quot; &gt; &quot;j, ś&quot;; &quot;d, δ&quot; &gt; &quot;δ&quot; &gt; &quot;z&quot; (10th cent.) &gt; &quot;r&quot; (13th cent.)&quot;; &quot;ğd&quot; &gt; &quot;z&quot; &gt; &quot;r&quot; (14th cent.); &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;ı&quot; (after 9th cent.). The shift from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;š&quot; operates before &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ï&quot;, and &quot;iV&quot;, and Vladimir Dybo calls the sound change the &quot;Bulgar palatalization&quot;.

Denis Sinor believed that the differences noted above suggest that the Oghur-speaking tribes could not have originated in territories inhabited by speakers of Mongolic languages, given that Mongolian dialects feature the &quot;-z&quot; suffix. Peter Golden, however, has noted that there are many loanwords in Mongolic from Oghuric, such as Mongolic &quot;ikere&quot;, Oghuric &quot;*ikir&quot;, Hungarian &quot;iker&quot;, Common Turkic &quot;*ikiz&quot; &#x27;twins&#x27;, and holds the contradictory view that the Oghur inhabited the borderlands of Mongolia before the 5th century.

The Oghuric tribes are also connected with the Hungarians, whose exo-ethnonym is usually believed to be derived from &quot;On-Oğur&quot; (&gt; &quot;(H)Ungari&quot;). &quot;Hungarians&quot; -&gt; &quot;Hun Oghur&quot; -&gt; (&quot;ten oghur tribes&quot;): On ogur -&gt; up.chv. Won ogur -&gt; dow.chv. Wun ogur -&gt; belor. Wugorac -&gt; rus. Wenger -&gt; slove. Vogr, Vogrin -&gt; cheh. pol. Węgier, Węgrzyn, -&gt; lit. Veñgras. The Hungarians are culturally of mixed Ugrian / Turkic heritage, with Oghuric-Bulgar and Khazar influences, even though much of the modern-day Hungarian gene pool also has strong Slavic, Germanic, and Iranic influences. Hungarian has many borrowings from Common Turkic and Oghuric languages:

Hung. &quot;tenger&quot;, Oghur. &quot;*tengir&quot;, Comm. &quot;*tengiz&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27;, Hung. &quot;gyűrű&quot;, Oghur. &quot;*ǰürük&quot;, Comm. &quot;*yüzük&quot; &#x27;ring&#x27;, and terms of equestrian culture &quot;ló&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;, &quot;nyereg&quot; &#x27;saddle&#x27;, &quot;fék&quot; &#x27;bridle&#x27;, &quot;ostor&quot; &#x27;whip&#x27;. A number of Hungarian loanwords were borrowed before the 9th century, shown by &quot;sz-&quot; (&lt; Oğ. &quot;*ś-&quot;) rather than &quot;gy-&quot; (&lt; Oğ. &quot;*ǰ-&quot;), for example Hung. &quot;szél&quot;, Oghur. &quot;*śäl&quot;, Chuv. &quot;śil&quot;, Comm. &quot;*yel&quot; &#x27;wind&#x27;, Hung. &quot;szűcs&quot; &#x27;tailor&#x27;, Hung. &quot;szőlő&quot; &#x27;grapes&#x27;.

In the Oghuz languages as azer. tur. &quot;öküz&quot; means &quot;ox&quot; (totemic animal), and is a reflection of the Chuvash language w&quot;ăkăr&quot; where rhotacism is used, in the Kipchak languages it is &quot;ögiz.&quot;

==History==
The Onogurs were one of the first Oghuric Turkic tribes that entered the Ponto-Caspian steppes as the result of migrations set off in Inner Asia. The 10th century Movses Kaghankatvatsi recorded, considered late 4th century, certain &quot;Honagur&quot;, &quot;a Hun from the Honk&quot; who raided Persia, which were related to the Onoghurs, and located near Transcaucasia and the Sassanian Empire. Scholars also relate the &quot;Hyōn&quot; to this account.

According to Priscus, in 463 the representatives of Ernak&#x27;s Saraghurs (Oghur. &quot;sara&quot;, &quot;White Oghurs&quot;), Oghurs and Onoghurs came to the Emperor in Constantinople, and explained they had been driven out of their homeland by the Sabirs, who had been attacked by the Avars in Inner Asia. This tangle of events indicates that the Oghuric tribes are related to the Ting-ling and Tiele people. It is considered they belonged to the westernmost Tiele tribes, which also included the Uyghurs-Toquz Oghuz and the Oghuz Turks, and were initially located in Western Siberia and Kazakhstan. Leo I the Thracian granted Ernak the lands of the treacherous Karadach&#x27;s Akatziroi roughly corresponding to 20th century Ukraine. Later kings of the Onogur Huns included Grod, Mugel and Sandilch, whose Utigurs were engaged in a civil war against the Kutrigurs of Khinialon.

The origin of the Kutrigurs and Utigurs, who lived in the vicinity of the Onoghurs and Bulgars, and their mutual relationship, is considered obscure. Scholars are unsure how the union between Onoghurs and Bulgars formed, imagining it as a long process in which a number of different groups merged. During that time, the Bulgars may have represented a large confederation of which the Onoghurs formed one of the core tribes, together with the remnants of the Utigurs and Kutrigurs, among others.

Jordanes in &quot;Getica&quot; (551) mentioned that the &quot;Hunuguri&quot; (believed to be the Onoghurs) were notable for the marten skin trade. In the Middle Ages, marten skin was used as a substitute for minted money. This also indicates they lived near forests and were in contact with Finno-Ugrian peoples.

The Syriac translation of the Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (c. 555) in Western Eurasia records the &quot;Avnagur&quot; (Aunagur; considered Onoghurs), &quot;wngwr&quot; (Onoğur), &quot;wgr&quot; (Oghur).The author wrote following: &quot;&quot;Avnagur (Aunagur) are people, who live in tents. Avgar, sabir, burgar, alan, kurtargar, avar, hasar, dirmar, sirurgur, bagrasir, kulas, abdel and hephtalit are thirteen peoples, who live in tents, earn their living on the meat of livestock and fish, of wild animals and by their weapons (plunder)&quot;. About the Bulgars and Alans, during the first half of 6th century, he added: &quot;The land Bazgun ... extends up to the Caspian Gates and to the sea, which are in the Hunnish lands. Beyond the gates live the Burgars (Bulgars), who have their language, and are people pagan and barbarian. They have towns. And the Alans - they have five towns.&quot;&quot; .

The Onoghurs (Oghurs), in the 6th and 7th century sources, were mentioned mostly in connection with the Avar and Göktürk conquest of Western Eurasia. According to the 6th century Menander Protector, the &quot;leader of the Οὐγούρων&quot; had the authority of the Turk Yabgu Khagan in the region of Kuban River to the lower Don.

In early 7th century Theophylaktos Simokattes recorded that certain Onoghur city &quot;Βακάθ&quot; was destroyed by an earthquake before his lifetime. The Sogdian name indicates it was situated in the vicinity of Iranian Central Asia.

Simokattes in the &quot;Letter of the Turk Qaγan (Tamgan) to the Emperor Maurikios&quot; recorded a complex notice:
&quot;...the Qaghan set off on another undertaking and subjugated all the &quot;Ὀγώρ&quot;. This people is (one) of the most powerful because of their numbers and their training for war in full battle-gear. They have made their abodes towards the East, whence flows the river &quot;Τίλ&quot;, which the Turks have the custom of calling the &quot;Black&quot;. The oldest chieftains of this people are called &quot;Οὐάρ&quot; and &quot;Χουννί&quot;.&quot;
According to the Qaghan, part of those &quot;Ouar&quot; (Uar) and &quot;Khounni&quot; (Huns) who arrived to Eastern Europe were mistook by the Onoghurs, Barsils, Sabirs and other tribes for the original Avars, and as such the Uar and Huns took advantage of the situation and began call themselves Avars. Simokattes also recounts &quot;&quot;when the Ogor, then, were brought completely to heel, the Qaγan gave over the chief of the &quot;Κὸλχ&quot; (Kolx) to the bite of the sword&quot;&quot;, shows Oghurs resistance toward Turkic authority. Scholars consider if the &quot;Til&quot; is &quot;Qara Itil&quot; (Black Itil) i.e. Volga (Atil/Itil), then the mentioned &quot;Ὀγώρ&quot; would be the Oghurs, while if it is in Inner Asia, then it could be the Uyghurs.

=== Avar Khaganate ===
By 568 the Avars, under Khagan Bayan I established an empire in the Carpathian Basin that lasted for 250 years. Related peoples from the east arrived in the Avar Kaganate several times: around 595 the Kutrigurs, and then around 670 the Onoghurs. The Avar Khaganate collapsed after 822, a few decades later, Álmos and his son Árpád conquered the Carpathian Basin around 862–895. The Hungarian conquerors together with the Turkic-speaking Kabars integrated the Avars and Onoghurs.

===Old Bulgaria===

Kubrat organised the Onogurs under his Empire of Old Great Bulgaria in the Mid 7th century. From the 8th century, the Byzantine sources often mention the Onoghurs in close connection with the Bulgars. Agathon (early 8th century) wrote about the &quot;nation of Onoghur Bulgars&quot;. Nikephoros I (early 9th century) noted that Kubrat was the lord of the &quot;Onoghundurs&quot;; his contemporary Theophanes referred to them as &quot;Onoghundur–Bulgars&quot;. Kubrat successfully revolted against the Avars and founded the Old Great Bulgaria (&quot;Magna Bulgaria&quot;), also known as &quot;Onoghundur–Bulgars&quot; state, or &quot;Patria Onoguria&quot; in the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;. Constantine VII (mid-10th century) remarked that the Bulgars formerly called themselves &quot;Onogundurs&quot;.

Onoghur-Bulgars who settled on the Volga river in the 7th century AD and converted to Islam in 922 during the missionary work of Ahmad ibn Fadlan, inhabited the present-day territory of Tatarstan. After the Batu Khan invasions of 1223–1236, the Golden Horde annexed Volga Bulgaria. Most of the population survived, and a certain degree of mixing between it and the Kipchaks of the Horde ensued. Onoghur-Bulgar group as a whole accepted the exonym &quot;Tatars.&quot;

This association was previously mirrored in Armenian sources, such as the &quot;Ashkharatsuyts&quot;, which refers to the &quot;Olxontor Błkar&quot;, and the 5th century &quot;History&quot; by Movses Khorenatsi, which includes an additional comment from a 9th-century writer about &quot;the colony of the Vłĕndur Bułkar&quot;. Marquart and Golden connected these forms with the &quot;Iġndr&quot; (*Uluġundur) of Ibn al-Kalbi (c. 820), the &quot;Vnndur&quot; (*Wunundur) of Hudud al-&#x27;Alam (982), the &quot;Wlndr&quot; (*Wulundur) of Al-Masudi (10th century) and Hungarian name for Belgrad &quot;Nándorfehérvár&quot;, the &quot;nndr&quot; (*Nandur) of Gardīzī (11th century) and &quot;*Wununtur&quot; in the letter by the Khazar King Joseph. All the forms show the phonetic changes typical of late Oghuric (prothetic &quot;w-&quot;; &quot;o-&quot; &gt; &quot;wo-&quot;, &quot;u-&quot;, &quot;*wu-&quot;).

<text>Daniel Benjamin Califf (born March 17, 1980) is an American retired professional soccer player who played as a defender.

==Youth and college career==
Califf (pronounced kāl&#x27;ĭ-f) was born in Orange, California. He started his youth career in soccer for Canyon Hills Soccer Association, playing on the Canyon Classic team coached by his father. He played college soccer at the University of Maryland from 1998 to 2000. As a freshman, he started all 24 of the team&#x27;s games, and was named to the Soccer America All-Freshman team for helping to lead the Terrapins to the Final Four. In his second year of college, he started 20 games, and was named an NSCAA third-team All-American.

==Club career==
After his sophomore season, Califf signed a Project-40 contract with MLS and entered the 2000 MLS SuperDraft, where he was selected sixth overall by the Los Angeles Galaxy. Califf was immediately slotted into the Galaxy&#x27;s starting line up, appearing in 18 games, 16 of them starts, as a rookie. Over the next three years, Califf would establish himself as one of the best central defenders in the league, starting 69 games for the Galaxy while helping the team to win a U.S. Open Cup in 2001 and a MLS Cup in 2002. Califf struggled with injuries in 2004, and was able to make only 10 starts, playing 855 minutes.

Califf was traded to the San Jose Earthquakes for an allocation prior to the 2005 season. He then regained his old form and even improved, being named to the MLS Best XI for the first time. Califf has scored seven league goals and four assists in six years in MLS.

He left the Quakes after just one season to sign with Aalborg in the Danish Superliga. In his first full season at Aalborg, Califf played 30 of 33 games, and helped the team win bronze medals in the 2006–07 Superliga season. Califf scored his first Aalborg goal on the last match day of the season, as bronze medal contenders Odense BK were defeated 3–1. After the season, during AaB&#x27;s Intertoto Cup campaign, Califf was named club captain. In the 2007–08 Superliga season he helped Aalborg to a gold medal but after the season he could not agree with Aalborg on a new contract. He eventually signed with Danish Superliga rivals Midtjylland.

On December 3, 2009, the Philadelphia Union announced that they had acquired Califf&#x27;s MLS rights from Houston Dynamo and that he would join the team for their inaugural 2010 season. Before the Union&#x27;s first game against Seattle Sounders FC he was announced as the team&#x27;s captain. Califf scored his first goal for the Union in the 2011 MLS season opener win against Houston Dynamo on March 19, 2011. He was named to the MLS Team of the week for this performance that match also. On June 8, Califf was named a nominee for the MLS All-Star Game. It was announced that he was fifth in defender voting for the All-Star Game.

On May 17, 2012, Califf was traded to Chivas USA for Michael Lahoud and allocation money. At the end of the 2012 season, Chivas USA declined Califf&#x27;s contract option and he entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 14, 2012, Califf was selected by Toronto FC with the first pick of stage two of the draft and that day signed a contract with Toronto for the 2013 season.

===Retirement===
Califf announced his retirement from soccer on July 12, 2013.

In 2014, Califf became an assistant coach under Charlie Dodds, President of YSC Sports, home of the Philadelphia Union Academy. After one year of coaching at YSC Sports, he returned to Toronto FC as a scout through 2016.

Califf has settled back in his hometown of Orange, CA with his family. Currently, he is the Founder and President of his own personal training company, Professional Soccer Resource (PSR) and holds the title of Technical Director for the youth soccer club Boca O.C.

==International career==
Califf has played for the United States national team at every level from the U-17&#x27;s to the senior team. He has appeared in the 1997 FIFA U-17 World Championship, the 1999 World Youth Championship in Egypt, and the 2000 Sydney Olympics . Additionally, he has appeared in 26 games for the full national team, getting his first cap against South Korea on January 19, 2002.

Califf played in the 2003 &amp; 2009 Confederations Cup, the 2002, 2003, &amp; 2009 Gold Cups and the 2007 Copa America.

<text>Gloria Hendry (born March 3, 1949) is an American actress and former model. Hendry is best known for her roles in films from the 1970s, most notably: portraying Rosie Carver in 1973&#x27;s James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;; and Helen Bradley in the blaxploitation film &quot;Black Caesar&quot;, and the sequel, &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in Jacksonville or Winter Haven, Florida (sources differ), Hendry was the older of two daughters. Hendry&#x27;s family, which consisted of her mother and sister relocated to Newark, New Jersey to live with her grandparents during her early childhood. Hendry studied at Essex College of Business for Law.

===Career===
Hendry worked as a Playboy Bunny at the New York Playboy Club from 1965 until 1972. In 1968, Hendry received her first acting role in Sidney Poitier&#x27;s film &quot;For Love of Ivy&quot;, followed by a small role in the 1970 film &quot;The Landlord&quot;. In 1973, Hendry portrayed the Bond Girl Rosie Carver in the James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. In that film, she became the first African American woman to become romantically involved with 007; Trina Parks, who played a nemesis to Bond rather than a love interest in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (the previous Bond film) is considered to be the first Black Bond girl.

Hendry later starred in several 1970s blaxploitation films, including &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; (1972), &quot;Slaughter&#x27;s Big Rip-Off&quot; (1973), and both the 1973 films &quot;Black Caesar&quot; and its sequel &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;. She also portrayed the martial arts expert, Sydney, in &quot;Black Belt Jones&quot; (1974), and appeared in &quot;Savage Sisters&quot; (1974) and &quot;Bare Knuckles&quot; (1977). Her later films included the horror film &quot;Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings&quot; (1994) and the action comedy &quot;Freaky Deaky&quot; (2012).

<doc id="1142204" wikidata="Q3991352" url="?curid=1142204" title="Tim Couch">
<text>Timothy Scott Couch (born July 31, 1977) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for five seasons with the Cleveland Browns. He played college football for the Kentucky Wildcats, where he set the Southeastern Conference record for single-season passing yards and won the Quarterback of the Year as a junior. Selected first overall by the Browns in the 1999 NFL draft, Couch was the franchise&#x27;s first draft pick following their reactivation as an expansion team.

Couch threw for over 11,000 passing yards and helped the Browns qualify for the postseason in 2002, but his career would be cut short by injuries. Following attempted comebacks with the Green Bay Packers and Jacksonville Jaguars, he retired after failing to make the final roster for either team. Although Couch was unable to duplicate his college success, he was the first quarterback to lead the Browns to the playoffs since their NFL return and the only to do so between 2002 and 2019.

==Early life==
Couch was born in Hyden, Kentucky. As a prep quarterback at Leslie County High School in Hyden, he set a number of national high school records: most pass completions (872), passing yardage (12,104), touchdown passes (132), and passing percentage for a season (75.1). After his senior season in 1995, he was the recipient of Kentucky&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Football&quot; award. ESPN ranked Couch as the sixth-best high school athlete ever. Couch also starred on the Leslie County High School basketball varsity team. He scored 36 points per game as a junior, which was the highest average in the state. Couch finished his high school career with 3,023 points.

==College career==
Couch attended the University of Kentucky, where he played for the Kentucky Wildcats football team from 1996 to 1998. During his 1996 freshman year under head coach Bill Curry, he split time as the starting quarterback with Billy Jack Haskins. Curry was fired after a 1–6 start that season, and replacement Hal Mumme announced early that Couch would be the starter in his new pass-oriented air raid offense. In 1997, Couch set several school records as the previously anemic Kentucky offense topped national offensive rankings and finished 5–6 on the season, including a win over #20 Alabama. During the 1998 season, Couch led Kentucky to seven wins (including a win on the road at #21 LSU) and a spot in the Outback Bowl (in which Couch completed 30 of 48 passes for 336 yards and two touchdowns, though Kentucky lost to Penn State 26–14). Following his junior season in 1998, Couch announced he would leave Kentucky to enter the NFL Draft early.

Couch&#x27;s career totals at Kentucky included completing 795 of 1,184 passes (67.1% completion rate) for 8,435 yards (including 4,275 passing yards during the 1998 season alone) and 74 touchdowns (including a 97-yard touchdown pass to Craig Yeast against Florida on September 26, 1998). Couch still holds the NCAA record for completion percentage in one game (minimum of 40 completions) at 83.0% against Vanderbilt (44 of 53) in 1998 and for completions per game (36.4, 400 in 11 games) that same season. He also left Kentucky holding NCAA records for most completions in a season (400 in 1998), most completions in a two-year period (793 in 1997–1998), most completions per game in a two-year period (34.7, 1997–1998) and career completion percentage (67.1%). His 1998 record of 4,151 offensive yards in a season stood for nine years as a Southeastern Conference (SEC) record until Florida quarterback Tim Tebow broke it with 4,181 yards in 2007. His 1998 total of 4,275 passing yards was an SEC record, until broken by Joe Burrow of LSU.

==Professional career==
Couch&#x27;s college success culminated in his selection as the number one overall selection in the NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns, who were returning to the NFL as an expansion team in 1999 following the original team&#x27;s 1996 relocation to Baltimore. Couch took over for Ty Detmer as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback in the second game of his rookie season. He spent five seasons as a starting quarterback for Cleveland, eventually facing competition from journeyman backup Kelly Holcomb during his final two seasons.

Couch&#x27;s tenure in Cleveland ranged from leading the team to a playoff appearance, to boos and inconsistent play, which was partially a result of being constantly plagued by injuries. He managed only one 300-yard passing game in his professional career. He missed the final nine games of the 2000 season with a broken thumb. The high point of Couch&#x27;s career came in 2002, when he threw for 2,842 yards and 18 touchdowns in leading the upstart Browns to a 9–7 record and a playoff appearance. However, he suffered a broken leg in the final game of the regular season and was forced to watch as Holcomb threw for over 400 yards in a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. This was the beginning of a quarterback controversy in Cleveland that would not be resolved until a year later when head coach Butch Davis tapped Holcomb as his starter. Couch&#x27;s 2003 season often included playing behind an offensive line hampered by injury. Couch is considered by Fox Sports to be one of the NFL&#x27;s biggest draft busts in its history after being taken #1, immediately ahead of fellow quarterback Donovan McNabb, only to falter through most of his career. However, Couch&#x27;s career has been defended by former Browns offensive coordinator Bruce Arians.

===Notable moments and achievements===

====Hail Mary passes====
Couch had several notable moments for the Browns, including two &quot;Hail Mary&quot; passes. In 1999 against the New Orleans Saints, his last-second touchdown pass to Kevin Johnson gave the Browns their first win. Three seasons later, in Jacksonville he tossed a game-winning pass on the last play of the game to Quincy Morgan. Couch holds the distinction of being the only quarterback in NFL history to throw two walk-off touchdown passes of 50 yards or more with 0:00 left on the clock.

====2002 season====
Although the 2001 Browns had raised eyebrows with their defense, having recorded 43 sacks and a league-best 33 interceptions, the offense was once again moribund. The run game was pitiful and the offensive line was porous. At the start of the 2002 preseason, star linebacker Jamir Miller went down with a career-ending Achilles tendon injury. However, the team, led by Couch, won 9 games, including five in the final two minutes and seven by 10 points or less, and made a wildcard playoff spot. Those thrillers included a 31–28 overtime win over Tennessee in which Couch threw for 326 yards and 3 touchdowns, a last minute touchdown and two-point conversion passes from Couch to Dennis Northcutt against the Jets, the &quot;Hail Mary&quot; against the Jaguars, and a final-minute drive against Baltimore where Couch threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mark Campbell after being pinned inside his own 5-yard line with 0 timeouts and 1:30 left in regulation.

====Attempted comebacks====
After the Browns released Couch in 2004, he signed as a free agent with the Green Bay Packers. Couch went on to have a disappointing training camp. Couch struggled with a rotator cuff injury, that would eventually require surgery, and was sidelined for the entire year.

Couch was released by the Packers during their final cutdown to 53 players prior to the season. Couch filed a grievance with the NFL Players Union against the Packers because they failed to attempt an injury settlement prior to his release.

After undergoing shoulder surgery in February 2005, Couch auditioned for the Chicago Bears midway through the 2005 season and the Cincinnati Bengals in December 2005. The Bears observed that his arm was not back to NFL shape during their workout and did not sign him. The Bengals did not pursue Couch, although Jon Kitna was not re-signed after his contract expired in early 2006.

Couch participated in tryouts with the Tennessee Titans in January 2006. He also had workouts with the Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Houston Texans. All three teams stated that despite good workouts, they were not interested in pursuing him. Couch ended up missing the entire 2006 season due to another shoulder surgery.

ESPN reported on July 20, 2007, that Couch had contacted all 32 NFL teams to see if any teams were interested in him for the 2007–2008 season. On July 29, 2007, Couch agreed to a two-year contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Couch was brought in to compete for the third-string quarterback position with Quinn Gray and Lester Ricard. He played in one preseason game against the Miami Dolphins and was 2-of-4 for 11 yards. On August 18, Couch failed to make the third string and was released. The next week, the Jaguars released former starter Byron Leftwich and Lester Ricard, leaving them without a third-string quarterback.

====All-time Browns rankings====
As of the end of the 2022 NFL season, Couch&#x27;s career passing ranking among other Cleveland Browns quarterbacks with at least 700 pass attempts.

* Pass attempts - 6th
* Pass completions - 5th
* Completion percentage - 2nd
* Yardage - 6th
* Touchdowns - 9th
* Interceptions - 7th
* Wins - 9th

==NFL career statistics==
===Awards and honors===
*NFL Rookie of the Month (October 1999)
*AFC Offensive Player of the Week (9/22/02)

==Broadcasting career==
In 2002, Couch played himself in an episode of &quot;The Jersey&quot; called &quot;Cheers, Jeers and Tears&quot; where cheerleading captain Hillary Lighter uses a magical jersey as she jumps into Couch&#x27;s body to get advice/lessons from professional cheerleaders on new cheers, shocking his coach and fellow players.

Couch worked for Fox Sports South for five years as an analyst on the weekly show &quot;SEC Gridiron Live&quot;. He also served as the color analyst for the SEC Regional Network football package, typically found on Fox Sports Net affiliates in most SEC territories. Affiliates included Sun Sports, Fox Sports South, Fox Sports Southwest Plus, Fox Sports Houston, Fox Sports Midwest Plus, Fox Sports North Plus, and Fox Sports San Diego.

On April 11, 2018, the Browns announced that Couch would be calling their 2018 preseason games alongside Jay Crawford.

==Personal life==
Couch&#x27;s son Chase graduated from high school in the spring of 2024. In January 2023, Chase received a verbal scholarship offer to play football at Kentucky.

Currently Couch and an older brother Greg are part owners of Meridian Wealth Management, a nationwide company based in Lexington.

<doc id="1142222" wikidata="Q241723" url="?curid=1142222" title="LGV Nord">
<text>The  (), typically shortened to LGV Nord, is a French -long high-speed rail line, opened in 1993, that connects Paris to the Belgian border and the Channel Tunnel via Lille.

With a maximum speed of , the line appreciably shortened rail journeys between Paris and Lille. Its extensions to the north (Belgium, the Channel Tunnel) and the south (via the LGV Interconnexion Est) have reduced journey times to Great Britain and Benelux and for inter-regional trips between the Nord (Pas de Calais) region and the southeast and southwest of France. Its route is twinned with the A1 for , which is why it was given its official nickname, the &quot;A1 Highway&quot;. As it is mostly built in flat areas, the maximum incline is 25 metres per kilometre (2.5‰).

Of all French high-speed lines, the LGV Nord sees the widest variety of high-speed rolling stock: the Alstom-made TGV POS, TGV Réseau, TGV Atlantique, TGV Duplex, Eurostar e300, Thalys PBA and PBKA and the Siemens Velaro-derived Eurostar e320, as well as rolling stock on local trains. Traffic is controlled by the Lille rail traffic centre.

==Route==
The LGV Nord begins at Arnouville-lès-Gonesse, from the Gare du Nord on the Paris–Lille railway line. At Vémars, the LGV Interconnexion Est joins it via a triangular junction, leading to Charles de Gaulle Airport and Marne-la-Vallée-Chessy; this enables direct trains from London and Amsterdam to Disneyland Paris, as well as the southern destinations (Lyon, Avignon and Marseille)

After passing east of the forest of Ermenonville over the viaduc de Verberie, it joins the A1 around Chevrières and accompanies it to the Lille suburbs.

At Ablaincourt-Pressoir (Somme), a new station, Gare TGV Haute-Picardie, is served only by inter-regional TGVs. At Croisilles, Pas-de-Calais, a junction leads to the Agny link towards Arras. The LGV crosses the A1 autoroute at Seclin (Nord).
At Fretin, a triangular junction links the LGV to the Lille-Brussels HSL 1 high-speed line eastwards, crossing the border at Wannehain and joining the conventional network at Lembeek, south of Brussels. After the Fretin junction, the LGV has a connection to the conventional network at Lezennes, near Lille. This junction is used for TGVs terminating at Lille, which use Lille-Flandres. TGVs that continue beyond Lille, as well as some Eurostar services, stop at Lille-Europe instead. Non-stop Eurostars pass through a tunnel under the city of Lille at .

The line passes south of Armentières and north of Hazebrouck. At Cassel, a link provides a connection with Dunkirk. The LGV continues west, crossing the A26 autoroute at Zouafques and ends at Calais-Fréthun, at the Eurotunnel terminal. This enables TGV service to Calais and Eurostars through the Channel Tunnel to London. The TGVs continue to Calais-Ville or reverse in either Calais stations and go on to Boulogne-sur-Mer and Étaples-Le Touquet and Rang-du-Fliers-Verton.
The route was much criticised, particularly by those in the Picardy region. The LGV crosses the region without a stop; Amiens in particular would have liked to have been on the line. The government judged a route via Amiens to be impracticable, as the Lille route demanded a straight line between Paris and Lille in order to give a reasonable Paris-Lille-London journey time. The LGV Picardie project would address this issue by serving Amiens, and would reduce the Paris–London journey time to less than 2 hours.

==Stations==

The LGV Nord serves the following stations:
* Gare du Nord (Paris)
* Gare TGV Haute-Picardie1
* Gare d&#x27;Arras²
* Gare de Lille-Europe
* Gare de Calais-Fréthun

1 Haute-Picardie station has been nicknamed &quot;Gare des Betteraves&quot; or &quot;Beetroot Station,&quot; since it is located in the middle of nowhere and is only accessible by good road connections. Amiens wanted a station closer to the town centre, stopping at Gare d&#x27;Amiens.
² Arras station is reached via a branch of the LGV Nord that splits off near the village of Croisilles.

==History==
* 
* 
* 
* 14 November 1994: First Eurostar service from Waterloo international To Paris Nord. The first service from The UK to France by Eurostar was made on the 14 November Connecting the now disused London Waterloo international via HS1 and the Channel Tunnel, Across LGV Nord to Paris (Gare du Nord). The full day service through to Paris Nord and Brussels south began later (28 May 1995.)

The line was designed to facilitate European connections. The foreseen opening of the Channel Tunnel made it a project of the utmost urgency, leading to an acceleration of work. It opened in 1993, a year before the tunnel, from Arnouville to Fréthun; the Belgian section followed in 1997.

===Future services===
At present, only Deutsche Bahn has applied for use of the line and in 2009 regulations were relaxed to allow its trains to use the Channel Tunnel. Other proposals are yet to be formalised.

====Deutsche Bahn====
In 2009, Eurotunnel (the owners of the Channel Tunnel) announced that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations, in order to permit other operators, such as Deutsche Bahn, to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock via LGV Nord. Under the deregulation of European railway service, high-speed lines were opened up to open access on 1 January 2010; the Inter-Governmental Commission on the Channel Tunnel (IGC) announced that it was considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting. LCR suggested that high-speed rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics. As of March 2010 Eurotunnel, High Speed 1, DB and other interested train operators formed a working group to discuss changes to the safety rules, including allowing DB&#x27;s trains through the tunnel on a Frankfurt to London service.

Deutsche Bahn hope to run an ICE 3 train through the Channel Tunnel on 19 October 2010, in preparation for possible future operations. The current Velaro ICE3 sets do not meet the fire safety requirements necessary for the carriage of passengers through the Channel Tunnel, but the Siemens Velaro D sets on order include the necessary additional fire-proofing. DB are considering a Frankfurt to London service which could start in 2020 taking about 4 to 5 hours with stops at Cologne and Brussels. The ICE 4 trains that are planned to be used on the route are yet to be given their permit to travel at speed through northern France and Belgium, increasing the time it will take for this service to come in fruition, but DB now allegedly plan to start a dual service. This would entail the use of two ICE 4 trains tethered together, travelling as far as Brussels Midi, before splitting, where one train will carry on to Amsterdam via Rotterdam and the other to Frankfurt via Cologne.

====Veolia====
In September 2008, Air France-KLM indicated a desire to take advantage of the change in the law and apply to run rail services.
However, in October 2009, Air France withdrew its interest. This led to Veolia looking for new partners, with the announcement that it would begin working on new proposals in cooperation with Trenitalia to run services from Paris to Strasbourg, London and Brussels.

====Renfe====

Spanish railway operator RENFE has also shown an interest in running AVE services from Spain to London via Paris, Lyon, Barcelona and Madrid via its AVE network which is connected to France via the Barcelona to Figueras and Perpignan to Figueras lines.
