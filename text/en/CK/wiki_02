<text>The Korg Poly-800 is an 8-voice analog synthesizer released by Korg in 1983. Its initial list price of $795 made it the first fully programmable polyphonic synthesizer that sold for less than $1,000. It was designed for portability, featuring battery power and a lightweight design that allowed the user to play with it strapped around their neck. It utilized digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs), and was a paraphonic synth with a single filter shared between its eight voices. 

== Sounds and features ==
Each DCO offers sawtooth and square waveforms, which are mixed together with a white noise generator before being sent to a voltage-controlled filter (VCF). The Poly-800 features 2 polyphony modes: Whole mode offers 8-voice polyphony with one DCO per voice, while Double mode places the DCOs in pairs for a richer sound, albeit at the expense of reducing polyphony to four voices. The VCF is shared across all voices, which means the Poly-800 is technically a paraphonic synth, instead of a polyphonic synth. The filter can be set to either single or multiple trigger modes; in single mode, the envelope is triggered by the first key press and won&#x27;t re-trigger until all keys are released. Multi mode allows each key press to trigger the filter envelope independently.

Each DCO features a digital envelope generator (DEG) to control its own volume. These DEGs have six stages: Attack, Decay, Break Point, Slope, Sustain, Release (ADBSSR). This offers advanced modulation possibilities such as two-stage decay or a secondary attack phase. The DEGs have a slight &#x27;stepped&#x27; effect on slow attacks, which can add nuance to sounds such as flutes.

The low-frequency oscillator (LFO) features a triangle wave that can be controlled with a joystick and features an optional delay for fading modulation in after playing a note. The joystick can be shifted upwards to modulate the DCO (creating vibrato effects), downwards to modulate the VCF, and side to side for altering the pitch bend. The Poly-800 features a 49-key non-velocity-sensitive keyboard and a built-in 256-step polyphonic step sequencer. 

Although it includes MIDI capabilities, it lacks MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx) functionality, with the exception of the expander version, the EX800, or through modification of the Poly-800 with an EX-firmware-ROM. Patch backup is performed via cassette tape. Early models of the Poly-800 required batteries to retain settings, with sounds and sequences being lost if the instrument was left without batteries, resulting in the synth powering up in a random state. To safeguard data, sounds and sequences could be saved and loaded via cassette, or as WAV or MP3 files.

The Poly-800 could operate on batteries and included guitar strap pegs for mobility, allowing performers to wear it similarly to a guitar. A variant with reversed-colored keys emulated the look of a Vox Continental organ.

==Variants==
In 1984, Korg introduced the EX-800, a keyboardless, rack-mountable version of the Poly-800, which included limited MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx) capability. The EX-800 could also be paired with a Poly-800 through MIDI to increase polyphony.

In 1986, Korg introduced the Poly-800 II, an updated version that swapped the original&#x27;s chorus effect for a digital delay with adjustable modulation, as well as a new colour scheme. The Poly-800 II also incorporated MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx) functionality, a programmable equalizer with high/low settings, program backups via MIDI in conjunction with the existing cassette interface, and expanded the sequencer&#x27;s memory capacity to 1000 events.

In 2020, Full Bucket Music released a free software emulation of the Poly-800, called Fury-800.

== Reception ==
At the time of its release, critics were not impressed with the Poly-800&#x27;s single VCF, its very basic settings, including parameters with as few as four steps that would typically be adjusted smoothly with knobs, and its somewhat restricted sound abilities. However, these aspects did not significantly detract from its popularity among users; the synthesizer became renowned for its distinctive joystick, optional reverse-color keyboard and strap pegs, allowing it to be played as a keytar.

The Poly-800 was the subject of numerous DIY enhancements and circuit-bending modifications. These include adding filter cutoff and resonance knobs, along with a switch to alternate the filter response between 4-pole and 2-pole, which was facilitated by the synthesizer&#x27;s filter chip including a 2-pole output that was not utilized by default.

<text>The Albany Convention was an independent governing body led by local civil and military officials centred on Albany, New York, during Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion.

When news of the Glorious Revolution reached the Province of New York in 1689, Jacob Leisler led a rebellion in which he appointed himself ruler of the Province of New York. Albany was the only centre which resisted Leisler&#x27;s claims to leadership. Under the leadership of Peter Schuyler and Robert Livingston the Albany Convention was formed which remained loyal to William and Mary. Leisler&#x27;s year-long attempt to subdue the Albany Convention led to a number of military engagements.

<text>Insolia is a component in the design of the high-heeled shoe designed by New Hampshire podiatrist Dr. Howard Dananberg. It reduces the pain associated with wearing high-heeled shoes by adjusting weight distribution back toward the heel through altering the geometry of the insole, rather than with padding.

==Concept==

With ordinary high-heeled shoes, the body weight is concentrated to the toes; this can make the wearer uncomfortable. The Insolia design shifts some of this weight back to the heel in an attempt to reduce high heel foot pain. The weight shift is accomplished by altering the geometry of the insole.

==Technology==
The original commercial implementation was an insole board that combined the structural elements of a high heel insole board with the patented Insolia contours. In early 2005, HBN Shoe developed the current implementation: an insole supplement that modifies a traditional high heel to give it the Insolia weight shifting geometry. This implementation is protected in the EU by one issued patent and other patents are pending in the US, the EU, and elsewhere. Insolia now also markets an after-market version that can be easily installed in shoes by consumers via its website.

<doc id="1117060" wikidata="Q601086" url="?curid=1117060" title="Atomic commit">
<text>In the field of computer science, an atomic [[Commit (data management)|commit]] is an operation that applies a set of distinct changes as a single operation. If the changes are applied, then the atomic commit is said to have succeeded. If there is a failure before the atomic commit can be completed, then all of the changes completed in the atomic commit are reversed. This ensures that the system is always left in a consistent state. The other key property of isolation comes from their nature as atomic operations. Isolation ensures that only one atomic commit is processed at a time. The most common uses of atomic commits are in database systems and version control systems.

The problem with atomic commits is that they require coordination between multiple systems. As computer networks are unreliable services, this means no algorithm can coordinate with all systems as proven in the Two Generals Problem. As databases become more and more distributed, this coordination will increase the difficulty of making truly atomic commits.

==Usage==
Atomic commits are essential for multi-step updates to data. This can be clearly shown in a simple example of a money transfer between two checking accounts.

This example is complicated by a transaction to check the balance of account Y during a transaction for transferring 100 dollars from account X to Y. To start, first 100 dollars is removed from account X. Second, 100 dollars is added to account Y. If the entire operation is not completed as one atomic commit, then several problems could occur. If the system fails in the middle of the operation, after removing the money from X and before adding into Y, then 100 dollars has just disappeared. Another issue is if the balance of Y is checked before the 100 dollars is added, the wrong balance for Y will be reported.

With atomic commits neither of these cases can happen, in the first case of the system failure, the atomic commit would be rolled back and the money returned to X. In the second case, the request of the balance of Y cannot occur until the atomic commit is fully completed.

==Database systems==
Atomic commits in database systems fulfil two of the key properties of ACID, atomicity and consistency. Consistency is only achieved if each change in the atomic commit is consistent.

As shown in the example atomic commits are critical to multistep operations in databases. Due to modern hardware design of the physical disk on which the database resides true atomic commits cannot exist. The smallest area that can be written to on disk is known as a sector. A single database entry may span several different sectors. Only one sector can be written at a time. This writing limit is why true atomic commits are not possible. After the database entries in memory have been modified they are queued up to be written to disk. This means the same problems identified in the example have reoccurred. Any algorithmic solution to this problem will still encounter the Two Generals’ Problem. The two-phase commit protocol and three-phase commit protocol attempt to solve this and some of the other problems associated with atomic commits.

The two-phase commit protocol requires a coordinator to maintain all the information needed to recover the original state of the database if something goes wrong. As the name indicates there are two phases, voting and commit.

During the voting phase each node writes the changes in the atomic commit to its own disk. The nodes then report their status to the coordinator. If any node does not report to the coordinator or their status message is lost the coordinator assumes the node&#x27;s write failed. Once all of the nodes have reported to the coordinator the second phase begins.

During the commit phase the coordinator sends a commit message to each of the nodes to record in their individual logs. Until this message is added to a node&#x27;s log, any changes made will be recorded as incomplete. If any of the nodes reported a failure the coordinator will instead send a rollback message. This will remove any changes the nodes have written to disk.

The three-phase commit protocol seeks to remove the main problem with the two phase commit protocol, which occurs if a coordinator and another node fail at the same time during the commit phase neither can tell what action should occur. To solve this problem a third phase is added to the protocol. The prepare to commit phase occurs after the voting phase and before the commit phase.

In the voting phase, similar to the two-phase commit, the coordinator requests that each node is ready to commit. If any node fails the coordinator will timeout while waiting for the failed node. If this happens the coordinator sends an abort message to every node. The same action will be undertaken if any of the nodes return a failure message.

Upon receiving success messages from each node in the voting phase the prepare to commit phase begins. During this phase the coordinator sends a prepare message to each node. Each node must acknowledge the prepare message and reply. If any reply is missed or any node return that they are not prepared then the coordinator sends an abort message. Any node that does not receive a prepare message before the timeout expires aborts the commit.

After all nodes have replied to the prepare message then the commit phase begins. In this phase the coordinator sends a
commit message to each node. When each node receives this message it performs the actual commit. If the commit message does not reach a node due to the message being lost or the coordinator fails they will perform the commit if the timeout expires. If the coordinator fails upon recovery it will send a commit message to each node.

==Revision control==
Atomic commits are a common feature of version control software, and crucial for maintaining a consistent state in the repository. Most version control software will not apply any part of a commit that fails. Notable exceptions are CVS, VSS and IBM Rational ClearCase (when in UCM mode).

For instance, if version control software encounters a merge conflict that can not be automatically resolved, then no part of the changeset is merged. Instead, the developer is given an opportunity to either revert their changes or manually resolve the conflict.

This prevents the entire project from entering a broken state due to a partially applied change set, where one file from a commit is successfully committed, but another file with dependent changes fails.

Atomic commits may also refer to the ability to simultaneously make changes across multiple projects using version control software in a single operation, using a version control software development strategy known as a monorepo.

==Atomic commit convention==

When using a revision control systems a common convention is to use small commits. These are sometimes referred to as atomic commits as they (ideally) only affect a single aspect of the system. These atomic commits allow for greater understandability, less effort to roll back changes, easier bug identification.

The greater understandability comes from the small size and focused nature of the commit. It is much easier to understand what is changed and reasoning behind the changes if one is only looking for one kind of change. This becomes especially important when making format changes to the source code. If format and functional changes are combined it becomes very difficult to identify useful changes. Imagine if the spacing in a file is changed from using tabs to three spaces every tab in the file will show as having been changed. This becomes critical if some functional changes are also made as a reviewer may simply not see the functional changes.

If only atomic commits are made then commits that introduce errors become much simpler to identify. One need not look through every commit to see if it was the cause of the error, only the commits dealing with that functionality need to be examined. If the error is to be rolled back, atomic commits again make the job much simpler. Instead of having to revert to the offending revision and remove the changes manually before integrating any later changes; the developer can simply revert any changes in the identified commit. This also reduces the risk of a developer accidentally removing unrelated changes that happened to be in the same commit.

Atomic commits also allow bug fixes to be easily reviewed if only a single bug fix is committed at a time. Instead of having to check multiple potentially unrelated files the reviewer must only check files and changes that directly impact the bug being fixed. This also means that bug fixes can be easily packaged for testing as only the changes that fix the bug are in the commit.

<doc id="1117064" wikidata="Q758845" url="?curid=1117064" title="Audio Adrenaline">
<text>Audio Adrenaline was an American Christian rock band that formed in 1986 at Kentucky Christian University in Grayson, Kentucky. The band gained recognition during the 1990s and received two Grammy Awards and multiple Dove Awards. Audio Adrenaline were regular performers at the annual Creation Festival, Spirit West Coast festival, Agape Music Festival, and Alive Festival. In 2007, the group disbanded due to lead singer Mark Stuart&#x27;s spasmodic dysphonia. 

After a hiatus, the band reformed in 2012 with only bassist Will McGinniss returning from the original line-up. The new Audio Adrenaline was fronted by Kevin Max, formerly of DC Talk, as the new lead vocalist. This new line-up released &quot;Kings &amp; Queens&quot; on March 12, 2013. In June 2014, Max stepped down as lead singer of the band. He was replaced by Josh Engler, a former member of the band Abandon until February 2015 when Adam Agee of Stellar Kart was offered and accepted the role.

In 2015, McGinniss departed from the band, leaving no original members left in the lineup. The first single of the new Audio Adrenaline, &quot;Love Was Stronger&quot;, was released in 2015 and was included on &quot;Sound of the Saints&quot;, their tenth and final studio album.

== History ==

===1986–1990: Formation as A-180 ===

The band was formed as A-180 in 1986 by Mark Stuart (lead vocals), Barry Blair (guitars), Will McGinniss (bass), David Stuart (keyboards), and Phil Vaughan (drums), who all attended Kentucky Christian University. The band went on hiatus the following year when Mark traveled to Haiti for a semester. Upon Mark&#x27;s return to Kentucky, the band reformed with Ron Gibson on drums. They became a popular local band, booked by the school nearly every weekend and traveling as far west as Texas, north to Chicago, and south to Florida. The band did over 100 shows during this time and recorded two independent releases under the name A-180. The first was &quot;You Turn&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Reaper&#x27;s Train&quot; in 1990. Reaper&#x27;s Train featured the original version of the song &quot;DC-10&quot;, which would later be included on the first Audio Adrenaline release.

The band&#x27;s big break would come upon meeting Bob Herdman. Herdman approached A-180 with two songs he had written, one of them called &quot;My God&quot;, and asked A-180 to record it. The song was described in a CCM Magazine article as &quot;a curious marriage of heavy metal and rap&quot;. After the song was recorded at Landmark Recording Studios, in Ohio, A-180 asked Herdman to join them as their songwriter. As a result, Herdman also started to learn to play keyboards and guitar. The demo tape of &quot;My God&quot; was sent to radio stations and quickly scaled the charts. Following this, the song caught the attention of Toby McKeehan (from dc Talk), who brought it to the executives at ForeFront Records. The label decided to offer a record deal to A-180 but had them change their name to Audio Adrenaline a name that Herdman had come up with previously.

=== 1991–1993: Record deal with ForeFront and first albums ===

After signing their deal with Forefront, the band started writing and recording demo songs similar to &quot;My God&quot; for the first album. The band has described this period as one of adaptation and experimentation since ForeFront wanted a hip-hop act. As a result, Dave Stuart and Ron Gibson left the band. Singer Mark Stuart said in an interview &quot;We had no idea what we were doing. Forefront signed us to do this rap/metal stuff, and we only had one song&quot; while original guitarist Barry Blair said &quot;We thought &#x27;If they liked My God, we&#x27;ll send them more songs like that.&quot; Blair added that it was a &quot;big, long process of getting to where we are now, of creating music we like, not music we think is what they [ForeFront] would like.&quot;

The band&#x27;s first Forefront album was the self-titled &quot;Audio Adrenaline&quot;, released in 1992. Filled with drum machine beats, rap and hip-hop it eventually went out of print. It included &quot;DC-10&quot;, the only track from the original A-180 recordings (live drums) and was well received selling 75,000 copies. However, the band was not happy with the result. Blair was quoted as saying:

The follow-up album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Censor Me&quot;, came the next year and featured what is considered the biggest hit of the band, &quot;Big House&quot;. The album sold 250,000 copies and launched the band into stardom. The album also includes the song &quot;We&#x27;re a Band&quot;, which remained one of their live staples. Next the band released &quot;Live Bootleg&quot;.

Although &quot;Don&#x27;t Censor Me&quot; leaned more towards rock, the band still was not happy. Stuart said of the songs &quot;there are really only a few songs I love to play live. I like to do &#x27;Big House,&#x27; &#x27;We&#x27;re a Band&#x27; and &#x27;Scum Sweetheart.&#x27;&quot; On the other hand, most of the band members disliked &quot;Jesus and the California Kid&quot; which Stuart referred to as &quot;pure agony&quot;. Still, the album earned them their first Dove Award for Long Form Music Video of the Year for &quot;Big House&quot;, as well as a Billboard Music Award Nomination.

=== 1994–1999: Maturity and success ===

As a result of the success of &quot;Don&#x27;t Censor Me&quot;, Audio Adrenaline went on tour opening for DC Talk on the &quot;Free at Last&quot; Tour and Newsboys&#x27; &quot;Going Public&quot; Tour. However, on interviews the band expressed their interest to grow beyond the shadow of their musical counterparts.

In 1996, their third studio album, &quot;Bloom&quot;, was released. The album featured the band returning to their original rock roots, as opposed to their experiments with rap music. Many reviewers praised the band&#x27;s decision to change and referred to the album as showcasing the maturity in the band members.

&quot;Bloom&quot; was a huge hit becoming (in 1999) the only album of the band to be certified gold by RIAA. It also marked guitarist Blair&#x27;s final album, who decided to become a music producer. In a 2015 interview with Breathecast, Blair talked about his reasons to leave citing his love of &quot;the creative part of writing, recording, being in the studio, putting songs together&quot; as the main factor. In the interview, he refers to the &quot;Bloom&quot; album as something he was &quot;exceptionally proud of&quot;, and how he knew he was creating something that had &quot;meaning and will touch people&quot;. Blair also added how his interest started to move away from the touring aspect until he &quot;decided to make the jump to see if I can sink or swim as a producer&quot;.

With Blair gone, Audio Adrenaline needed a new guitarist. They found a temporary fill-in with Brian McSweeney (from Seven Day Jesus), but he decided to stay with his full-time act. They then turned the guitars over to Tyler Burkum, who joined the band at only 17 years of age, just in time to record some guitars on the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Some Kind of Zombie&quot;. The album, released in 1997, included a song from Barry Blair and was the first to feature Ben Cissell as the band&#x27;s full-time drummer, though Cissell had played percussion on their previous album.

In 1999, the band released &quot;Underdog&quot;, its fifth studio album. Songwriter Bob Herdman called the album &quot;more fun&quot; than the previous one, while bassist Will McGinniss said how they wanted to &quot;explore more artistically&quot;, while merging &quot;ideas from the last three records&quot;. The album includes a remake of the band&#x27;s own &quot;DC-10&quot;, which was originally featured in their first album, but this time using a swing style. The album was well received by critics, while peaking at #76 on Billboard. After the release, the band also opened for dc Talk on the Jesus Freak World Tour.

=== 2000–2007: Last albums with original members and retirement ===

After a short break, Audio Adrenaline released their first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, in March 2001. Included in the album are three of their most popular songs, &quot;Big House&quot;, &quot;Hands and Feet&quot;, and the live staple &quot;We&#x27;re A Band&quot;, as well as a song with The O.C. Supertones, &quot;Blitz&quot;, from the album &quot;Some Kind of Zombie&quot;. It was at this time that Herdman left the band to become president of a new record label, Flicker Records, which he co-founded along with Stuart and McGinniss.

In November 2001, the band released a new studio album, &quot;Lift&quot; which several critics have classified as the band&#x27;s best. &quot;Lift&quot; also marked the first time that guitarist Burkum shared lead vocals with Stuart. The band then followed with their ninth album, &quot;Worldwide&quot;, released in 2003. &quot;Worldwide&quot; went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album in 2004, the first of two Grammys for the band. In 2004, the band, along with Herdman, founded a project in Haiti called the Hands and Feet Project, in which the band built an orphanage for children.

The band&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Until My Heart Caves In&quot;, was released on August 30, 2005. The album featured most of the lead vocals by Burkum, with only a few sung by Stuart. &quot;Until My Heart Caves In&quot; received another Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album in 2006. &quot;Clap Your Hands&quot; was also played on ESPN with football game highlights.

On January 18, 2006, Audio Adrenaline announced that they were retiring from active music ministry and cited Stuart&#x27;s &quot;ongoing vocal challenges&quot; stemming from vocal cord damage as the primary factor. On July 27, 2006, the band played at the popular Christian music Creation Festival, where they had performed every year since the group formed, for the last time with their original lineup. On August 1, 2006, they released their final compilation album, &quot;&quot;, a farewell album containing two new tracks as well as a selection of the band&#x27;s greatest hits to date.

For their final national tour in early 2007, Audio Adrenaline opened for MercyMe on their &quot;Coming Up to Breathe Tour&quot;. The band performed their last live concert on April 28, 2007, at the Waikiki Shell in Honolulu, Hawaii. Their final project, &quot;Live From Hawaii: The Farewell Concert&quot;, was released on August 28, 2007, as a live CD–DVD combo and earned two nominations at the 39th GMA Dove Awards, winning Long Form Music Video of the Year.

=== 2008–2011: Other projects ===

After the band&#x27;s retirement, their members dedicated their time to other projects. Mark Stuart and Will McGinniss started a project called Know Hope Collective, which features a changing group of musicians singing worship songs and presenting testimonies. They both have also been working extensively with The Hands and Feet Project in Haiti. Tyler Burkum has been playing for several bands and as a session musician. He also started his own band called The Leagues. Ben Cissell ran a skate club/youth ministry venue called Rocketttown, and then started pursuing film work. Finally, Bob Herdman has been working as a Project Manager for several companies in the Nashville area.

The group played a reunion performance at Easterfest &#x27;09 in Queens Park, Toowoomba, Australia.

=== 2012–2017: Reformation and new singers ===

In 2012, former members Stuart and McGinniss, along with the band&#x27;s new manager Wes Campbell, decided to re-launch the band with a new line-up. According to them, one of their options was to ask Kevin Max, formerly of DC Talk, to be the new lead vocalist. Max, who had worked with Audio Adrenaline previously, said it was &quot;a no-brainer&quot; for him when they approached him.

In addition to Max as the new lead vocalist, the band also added Dave Ghazarian of Superchick on the guitar, Jared Byers of Bleach on the drums, Jason Walker on the keyboard, and McGinniss on bass. Former singer Stuart remained as producer and songwriter. On March 3, 2013, Audio Adrenaline released &quot;Kings and Queens&quot;. The album peaked at No. 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and No. 4 on the Christian Albums chart. Aside of its chart performance, &quot;Kings &amp; Queens&quot; received praise from critics who referred to it as &quot;possibly the greatest comeback project in Christian music today&quot; and a &quot;fresh album that will keep both old and new fans alike&quot;.

In 2013, Dave Ghazarian and Jason Walker left the band, and were replaced by Dwayne Larring formerly of Sonicflood. In June 2014, Kevin Max also stepped down as lead vocalist. In an interview with Jesus Freak Hideout, Max said the decision was &quot;amicable&quot; and cited a difference of opinion in terms of the band&#x27;s musical future as the reason for his departure. According to Max, the band&#x27;s management wanted to move the band towards a more &quot;worship music mode&quot;, even becoming the house band for the Acquire the Fire events, whereas he was more interested in a more &quot;alternative or indie pop rock&quot; style.

Max was temporarily replaced by Josh Engler from Abandon who transitioned in taking on vocal duties. In February 2015, drummer Jared Byers left the band to pursue other interests, but was followed by Dwayne Larring, Engler and founder Will McGinniss. McGinniss wrote a statement in which he called the last years &quot;an incredible blast and honor&quot;, but cited his desire to work more fully with the Hands &amp; Feet Project as his reason to leave the band. His departure left the band with no original members remaining.

On February 10, 2015, Adam Agee, lead singer of Christian rock band Stellar Kart announced that he would assume the role of lead singer for the band along with guitarist Brandon Bagby to replace Larring, bassist Dave Stovall to replace McGinniss, and drummer Jack Campbell to replace Byers. They also released &quot;Love Was Stronger&quot; on February 10, 2015, off the album, &quot;Sound of the Saints&quot;.

Following their 2017 tour, the band has not released any updates. In 2019, Mark Stuart released &quot;Losing My Voice to Find It&quot;, reflecting on his time in Audio Adrenaline, losing his ability to sing, and the time after. In 2023, Agee joined the Newsboys as a full-time member.

Timeline

== Other projects ==

On September 1, 2003, the band released its first book &quot;Dirty Faith: Becoming the Hands and Feet of Jesus&quot;, with Think Books. Co-written with Mark Matlock, the book discusses reaching out to the needy and features an organization called Mission Year.

In 2003, Mark Stuart was involved in &quot;!Hero the Rock opera&quot;, playing &quot;Petrov&quot;. &quot;!Hero&quot; was a modern adaption of the story of Christ. Also involved in this production were Michael Tait as HERO, CCM pop vocalist Rebecca St. James as Maggie, Skillet&#x27;s John Cooper as Kai, the chief Rabbi, and rapper T-Bone as Jairus.

On September 5, 2006, the band released &quot;Hands &amp; Feet: Inspiring Stories and Firsthand Accounts of God Changing Lives&quot;, with Regal Books. It takes the reader on a journey to Haiti with the band as they build houses for the children there. The reader also meets Drex and Jo Stuart, the parents of frontman Mark Stuart. The book gives an explanation of life in one of the poorest nations on earth. It also tells of the band&#x27;s building of The Hands and Feet Project (an orphanage for poor, hungry children).

in 2007, Stuart and Will McGinniss launched &quot;Audio Unplugged&quot; (also known as &quot;Audio Talks&quot;), a post-retirement speaking venture that offers &quot;a night of encouragement, testimonies, Audio A classics and worship.&quot;

The Union has 86 national and regional member societies with about 60,000 scientists in several countries and individual members in 57 countries. Every four years, the IUSS holds the World Congress of Soil Science.

As of January 2023, the secretariat was taken over by the Council for Agricultural Research and Economics of Italy. Previously, the secretariat was managed by Sigbert Huber, an officer of the Environment Agency Austria (Umweltbundesamt), located in Vienna.

== Mission ==
The purpose of the IUSS is to promote all branches of soil science and its applications, to promote contacts among scientists and other persons engaged in the study and the application of soil science; to stimulate scientific research and to further the application of such research.

The IUSS is a founding partner of the International Year of Planet Earth and supports all of its activities. The IUSS has contributed to the International Year of Planet Earth&#x27;s brochure &quot;Soil – earth&#x27;s living skin&quot;, which has been translated into several languages.

The IUSS publishes monthly the &quot;IUSS Alert&quot; and twice a year the &quot;IUSS Bulletin&quot;. December 5 is celebrated as the &quot;World Soil Day&quot;.

==Divisions==
The IUSS has Divisions and Commissions in the following areas:

===Division 1 – Soils in space and time===
*C1.1 Soil morphology and micromorphology
*C1.2 Soil geography
*C1.3 Soil genesis
*C1.4 Soil classification
*C1.5 Pedometrics
*C1.6 Paleopedology

===Division 2 – Soil properties and processes===
*C2.1 Soil physics
*C2.2 Soil chemistry
*C2.3 Soil biology
*C2.4 Soil mineralogy
*C2.5 Soil chemical, physical and biological interfacial reactions

===Division 3 – Soil use and management===
*C3.1 Soil evaluation and land use planning
*C3.2 Soil and water conservation
*C3.3 Soil fertility and plant nutrition
*C3.4 Soil engineering and technology
*C3.5 Soil degradation control, remediation, and reclamation

===Division 4 – The role of soil in sustaining society and the environment===
*C4.1 Soil and the environment
*C4.2 Soil, food security, and human health
*C4.3 Soil and land use change
*C4.4 Soil education and public awareness
*C4.5 History, philosophy, and sociology of soil science

This structure and the Commissions have grown from the original six Commissions established in 1924.

In addition, the IUSS holds many Working Groups. Every Working Group is associated to a Commission.

== President ==
Until 2014, the IUSS President was designated by the national soil science society that was responsible for the next World Congress of Soil Science. This was normally a four-year period. The change in office was immediately after closing the World Congress. However, many tasks of scientific leadership were done by a Secretary-General. The last IUSS President according to this regulation was Jae Yang, who acted from the closure of the World Congress 2010 till the closure of the World Congress 2014.

Since 2014, the IUSS President is elected by the IUSS Council for a two-year period. Since 2017, the change in office is January 1. The election is more than two years in advance. The IUSS President is the scientific leader, and the Secretary (instead of the former Secretary-General) is the organizing leader. The first IUSS President according to the new regulation was Rainer Horn, who acted from the closure (June 13) of the World Congress 2014 till December 31, 2016.

<doc id="1117072" wikidata="Q1154195" url="?curid=1117072" title="Ken Matsudaira">
<text>is a Japanese actor and musician from Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan. His real name is .

== Career ==
In 1974, he joined Shintaro Katsu&#x27;s production company and made his debut with the television series Zatoichi as a guest. For a quarter of a century, he starred in the series &quot;The Unfettered Shogun&quot; as Tokugawa Yoshimune, the title character. He also played a similar role in Kamen Rider OOO Wonderful.

Other noteworthy roles include Hōjō Yoshitoki in the 1979 NHK series &quot;Kusa Moeru&quot;, Irobe Matashiro in the 1999 NHK series &quot;Genroku Ryoran&quot; (involving the chushingura, that is, the story of the Forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot;), Shibata Katsuie in the 2002 NHK series &quot;Toshiie to Matsu&quot;, Ōtomo Sōrin in the 2004 NHK special &quot;Ōtomo Sōrin—Kokoro no Ōkoku wo Motomete&quot;, and Ōishi Kuranosuke in the 2004 TV Asahi series &quot;Chushingura&quot;. He also played Asano Takumi no Kami, an important (although brief) role, in an earlier chushingura, making a career of that story. In 2005, he is appearing as Benkei in &quot;Yoshitsune&quot;, the yearlong NHK Taiga drama. TV Asahi tapped Matsudaira to star as Tōyama no Kin-san in the latest (2007) version of their program of the same name. He appeared in &quot;Tokugawa Fūun-roku&quot;, the annual &quot;jidaigeki&quot; spectacular which was shown on TV Tokyo on January 2, 2008.

=== &quot;Matsuken Samba&quot; ===

Matsudaira is also famous as a singer. His most popular song &quot;Matsuken Samba II&quot; (マツケンサンバII) was released in 2004 and became popular with his fanbase. The song gained national attention because his appearance in the likeness of a person in Edo period with glittery kimono and a hip-swiveling dance became the topic of some television programs, including parodying him on an idol group SMAP&#x27;s variety show, &quot;SMAP×SMAP&quot;. The new attention of the media made Matsudaira visible to a younger fanbase. The song became a certified hit, staying on the Oricon Top 100 chart for over a year. A version called featuring Shu Watanabe (Eiji Hino/Kamen Rider OOO) and Ryosuke Miura (Ankh/Shingo Izumi) was released on August 3, 2011, as an ending theme for the movie &quot;Kamen Rider OOO Wonderful: The Shogun and the 21 Core Medals&quot;.

<doc id="1117075" wikidata="Q13219786" url="?curid=1117075" title="Homebush railway station">
<text>Homebush railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Suburban line in Homebush in the Municipality of Strathfield local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was designed and built by the New South Wales Government Railways and opened on 26 September 1855. In addition to being located on the Main Suburban line, the station is also located on the Main South and Main Western railway lines. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The station is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West and T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line services.

==History==
The Main Western line to Parramatta, via Granville station was originally completed in 1855. The line opened on 26 September 1855 and was double track from Sydney Central to Newtown station and then single track to Parramatta (but duplicated in 1856). The line was built as a direct connection to Parramatta and, subsequently, for the purpose of connecting Sydney with the major rural railways that were constructed across the Blue Mountains to Bathurst and across the Southern Highlands to Goulburn via Liverpool. There were few stops along the line between Sydney and Parramatta and it was not the original intention of the line to serve suburban development. Changes to the line were more often related to the line&#x27;s long distance purpose than to the communities along it.

The Homebush to Waratah railway line was opened in 1886 from Homebush to Hornsby, and subsequently further extended, eventually connecting to Waratah in 1889. This line (now the Main North line) initially had connections to both Homebush and Strathfield, but after 1892 the main line connected to Strathfield, and today only freight trains use the single track north from Homebush. 
Traffic to the west and south (and later north) of the state brought the need to amplify the line, first in 1891 when it was quadrupled and later in 1927 when it was sextupled (to Homebush) and electrified. With both of these major changes the earlier stations were usually entirely demolished and replaced with a new station. The 1927 work completed this process with the complete replacement of Strathfield and much of Newtown Stations. During this time suburban development also extended west along the line and these new stations were thus specifically designed as full-scale suburban passenger stations rather than rural &quot;halts&quot;. The Engineer for Existing Lines, George Cowdery (appointed 1863), was a particularly strong influence on the architecture of this line, building particularly elegant stations in the late 1880s ahead of the 1891 quadruplication, in addition to replacing the original stone arch viaduct at Lewisham with iron truss bridges. Sextuplication in 1927 brought less change to most local stations (which were on the southern side), the new tracks being express ones on the northern side.

Homebush station opened on 26 September 1855 when the Main Suburban line opened. In 1858, Homebush was the location of an accident involving NSW Railway&#x27;s Locomotive No. 1, built by Robert Stephenson and Company, when the passenger train it was hauling left the rails and toppled down an embankment, killing two people.

In 1862 a new station building was erected on the southern side and in the 1870s stockyards were erected adjacent to the station (the stockyards serviced the Glebe Island NSW Government abattoirs). The stockyards were closed and replaced by Flemington stockyards in 1883.

In 1891, with quadruplication, Homebush station was completely rebuilt resulting in the present station layout being established with a centre island platform opening in late 1891. The station comprised large platform buildings, an overhead pedestrian footbridge with a booking office and an existing 1880s Station Master&#x27;s Residence on the north side of the station. The station was expanded to six platforms when the line between Redfern and Homebush was sextupled in the 1920s.

The existing three-storey brick signal box was built in 1892 and remained in use until 1928 when its function was replaced by a new &quot;power&quot; box. The 1928 signal box remained in use until 1982 when it was replaced by a simple brick and concrete building. The 1892 signal box is now the only remaining box at the station of the five built since the station opened.

For many years Homebush was the terminating point for local suburban services on the Western line. A carriage shed was built at Homebush in 1890 located to the east of Homebush Road which connected to one of a number of sidings built at the station during this period. The carriage shed was later used as a store then training and education facilities until it was demolished in 2001.

In 1891 a locomotive depot and locomotive watering facilities were also constructed near the carriage shed. By the late 1920s the Depot was largely redundant and was ultimately demolished .

Numerous smaller buildings were also constructed at Homebush such as a telephone exchange, storage sheds, amenities buildings and a track ganger&#x27;s shed. All have been demolished.

The station also featured a Garden Nursery, a single storey building built in 1923 along the eastern frontage of The Crescent which was established so that other stations could be provided with a range of shrubs and flower plants to improve their landscaped appearance. Railway station gardens were created statewide from c.1890 onwards. Competitions and prizes sprang up and two nurseries (Homebush and Hamilton, near Newcastle) were opened to provide plants, in addition to those sourced from staff home gardens. Changing practices both in nursery supplies and the station gardens promotions saw the nursery close in 1974 and its staff of gardeners disbanded.

Due to increased goods train traffic, two lines were built on the north side of the station in 1924 converting the side platform into an island. The footbridge was also extended over the new tracks and a two-storey office built abutting the footbridge on its western side. These changes resulted in the demolition of the 1880 station master&#x27;s Residence.

===1990s to date===
In 1992 the steel footbridge was replaced by the present pre-cast concrete bridge having part replica steel lattice balustrades imitating the original wrought iron lattice girder design.

On 9 October 1994, a large fire destroyed the original heritage-listed buildings on platforms 3 and 4, they were later rebuilt as a similar awning structure. During the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the station was closed to avoid confusion with Olympic Park station, in the similarly named suburb of “Homebush Bay” but some distance away. Homebush Bay is no longer a suburb, with the majority of the area becoming the new suburb of Sydney Olympic Park in 2009 due to continuing confusion at Homebush station during major events.

Under the Rail Clearways Program, an additional platform (Platform 7) was built to the south, with tracks rearranged to create a turnback at platform 6. This turnback platform enabled all stations trains to be terminated clear of the running lines and create extra capacity between Homebush and Lidcombe station.

On 20 October 2013, a new timetable was introduced which saw Homebush become the terminus for local T2 Inner West &amp; South line services to and from the city. Most trains continuing beyond Homebush did not stop at the station. As a result, the only way to travel west from Homebush was to travel one stop east to Strathfield to connect with trains continuing further west. Only a few weekday services connected with Flemington.

An accessibility upgrade, including lift access to the station, was announced in 2015.

In 2017, some local T2 Inner West &amp; Leppington weekday trains were extended to Parramatta, finally allowing a connection to Flemington station.

===Signalling===
Rail traffic in the Homebush area has been controlled from the adjacent Strathfield signal box since 1983. From 1893 to 1928, a large mechanical signal box controlled traffic through Homebush. This building, situated to the south west of the station, opposite Homebush Public School, still stands. From 1928 to 1983, a pistol grip power box situated immediately to the west of platforms 1 and 2 was in use. It was damaged by fire and demolished, some time after its closure.

==Platforms and services==
Homebush station is the western terminus of services on the &quot;inner west&quot; stopping pattern of the T2 Inner West &amp; Leppington line, which originate from the City Circle, terminate at platform 6 and then return to the City Circle. Through-services proceed west from here towards Parramatta or Leppington, and east towards Central and the City Circle.

Platform 1 does not actually exist on the station&#x27;s numbering system, however, behind the existing Platform 2 is the North Strathfield Junction goods line, which previously had a platform when the goods line was double track. The platform is now fenced off from the goods line.

==Transport links==
Transit Systems operates one bus route via Homebush station, under contract to Transport for NSW:
*408 Rookwood Cemetery to Westfield Burwood via Flemington and Strathfield

Homebush station is served by two NightRide routes:
*N60 Fairfield station to Town Hall station

As at 26 October 2010, Homebush Railway Station has state significance as the site of three different railway stations that represent three significant historical phases in the development of the NSW railways. The site is significant as one of only four original intermediate stations on the first railway line in NSW between Sydney and Parramatta; the subsequent rebuilding of the station in the 1860s was associated with servicing the nearby Government Abattoirs at Homebush; and the existing station arrangement dating from the 1891 quadruplication of the line represents the expansion of the railways in the late 19th century to accommodate increasing rail services.

Homebush Railway Station is significant for its rare collection of railway structures dating from 1891 that form a unique and cohesive group. Designed under the direction of Commissioner Edward Eddy, the platform buildings demonstrate the first use of island platforms in NSW and are one of only four extant examples of 1891 &quot;Standard Eddy&quot; platform buildings. The 1891 overhead booking office is also a rare structure being one of only three similar structures representing the earliest use of above-platform buildings. The station buildings including the signal box, brick store rooms and footbridge collectively demonstrate a former era of travel, communication and trade. The group remains highly intact.

Homebush railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Homebush Railway Station Group has historical significance at the state level representing three significant historical phases in the development of the NSW railways. Established during the first phase of NSW railway construction in the 1850s the site is significant as one of only four original intermediate stations on the first railway line in NSW between Sydney and Parramatta. The subsequent (second) rebuilding of the station in the 1860s was associated with servicing the nearby Government Abattoirs at Homebush. The existing (third) station arrangement with its extant platforms, station buildings and signal box dates from the 1891 quadruplication of the line represents the expansion of the railways in the late 19th century to accommodate increasing rail services. The existing 1890s platform buildings are historically significant as they are able to demonstrate the first use of island platforms in NSW. In addition the signal box, footbridge and brick store rooms collectively demonstrate a former era of travel, communication and trade.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

The signal box and remaining contemporary railway buildings at Homebush railway station are closely identified with Commissioner Edward Eddy under whose direction the Homebush Railway station and signal box were designed, the station buildings being the first of the new standard type of station buildings.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

As a group the form, fabric and detailing of the Homebush station buildings characterise the type of construction and architectural style employed in late 19th century railway station buildings in the Sydney region. The 1890s &quot;Standard Eddy&quot; platform buildings all the characteristic features of this type of station building, namely cantilevered awnings with wide fascia and most importantly the purpose-designed location on island platforms. The 1890s overhead booking office is aesthetically significant as it has characteristic features of this type of station building namely the use of brick for construction, the small size of the building and the location of the building on the footbridge. The 1890s signal box is an in-operational signal box, with no signalling equipment and deteriorated interiors but it retains a number of features which typify this type of signal box, including inverted corrugated galvanised iron awnings above the operating level windows and landing and the full building width second floor landing which has a small timber compartment for a toilet at its rear.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The place has the potential to contribute to the local community&#x27;s sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community&#x27;s history.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Homebush Railway Station has low archaeological research potential. Any evidence pertaining to the former station master&#x27;s residence, the 1890s carriage shed, locomotive depot, locomotive watering facilities, and the 1923 nursery has been removed or disturbed by subsequent developments on site. The 1920s telephone exchange building has also been demolished and the site on which it existed has been levelled and planted with vegetation.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Homebush Railway Station is significant for its rare collection of railway structures dating from 1891 that form a unique and cohesive group. Homebush Railway Station is one of the four known stations including Croydon, Katoomba and Summer Hill which have extant &quot;Standard Eddy&quot; platform buildings. The 1891 overhead booking office is also a rare structure being one of only three known examples of similar pre1910 overhead booking offices in the state, the others being at Newtown and Redfern.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The platform buildings at Homebush Station are in a largely intact condition externally and they are good representations of the &quot;Standard Eddy&quot; building.

The Homebush signal box is still able externally to demonstrate the essential design qualities of a late 19th-century elevated signal box of the NSW Government Railways. The design was widely used throughout the system from 1883 until 1911, and some twenty boxes of either full timber or mostly brick load-bearing wall construction were built.

<text>Deepwater Black is a 1992 novel, first in the Deepwater trilogy, by the New Zealand science fiction writer Ken Catran, with a cast of young characters who are supposedly stranded in space while a virus ravages Earth. The book series itself is quite different from the television series later developed. The approach of the novels focused on the characters as younger children, around 13–14, rather than the television approach, in which the characters were much older.

== Plot ==
The main plot involves a virus that breaks out and leaves the humans residing on Earth doomed. In a desperate attempt before the end, all humanity&#x27;s resources are dedicated to a crash program to produce a deep space ark, capable of seeding humanity on a new world. The ship is crewed by six clones, teenage versions of people who achieved great works during the ark project, equipped with the memories of their donors. Before reaching their destination, however, the crew is awoken prematurely to face a threat to the ship, before their memories are complete. They must come to terms with the workings of the ship, the dangers faced by their ship, the realization that they are clones, and their ultimate destiny to save their race.

== TV series ==

The trilogy was adapted as the Sci Fi Channel&#x27;s first original scripted television series in 1997 under the name &quot;Mission Genesis&quot;. The series was a co-production between YTV Network and USA Networks, and was distributed by Sunbow Entertainment. In Canada and the United Kingdom, the series retained the original title, &quot;Deepwater Black&quot;. Only one season of 13 episodes was made, and involved a relatively small cast and heavy use of CGI. Soon after production ended, lead actress Nicole de Boer joined the cast of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and lead actor Gordon Michael Woolvett joined the cast of &quot;Andromeda&quot;.

The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Music for the series was composed and performed by Fred Mollin.

<doc id="1117087" wikidata="Q7605795" url="?curid=1117087" title="Steele Hall">
<text>Raymond Steele Hall (30 November 1928 – 10 June 2024) was an Australian politician who served as the 36th Premier of South Australia from 1968 to 1970. He also served in the federal Parliament as a senator for South Australia from 1974 to 1977 and federal member for the Division of Boothby from 1981 to 1996.

Hall was a state parliamentarian from 1959 to 1974 and served as Liberal and Country League leader from 1966 to 1972 and Premier from 1968 to 1970. He introduced electoral reform, removing the Playmander which favoured the Liberal and Country League, which contributed to his party&#x27;s loss at the 1970 South Australian state election. In 1972 he founded the Liberal Movement, and resigned from the Liberal and Country League when the Liberal Movement split from the Liberal and Country League in 1973. He continued as a state parliamentarian until he resigned his seat in 1974 to be the Liberal Movement&#x27;s lead Senate candidate at the 1974 Australian federal election.

Hall won a Senate seat for the Liberal Movement at both the 1974 and 1975 elections. After the Liberal Movement disbanded in 1976 he rejoined the Liberal Party, as it was now called in South Australia, and he resigned from the senate in 1977 to contest the seat of Hawker at the 1977 election, but was unsuccessful. In 1981 he won the seat of Boothby at the 1981 by-election, and remained the Liberal member for Boothby until his retirement in 1996.

==Early life==
Hall was born on 30 November 1928 in Balaklava, South Australia, the son of Florence (née Fisher) and Sidney Hall. He attended primary school in Owen and subsequently graduated from Balaklava High School. After leaving school he worked on the family property in Owen, an sheep and wheat farm.

==Political career==

===State politics===

Hall was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Liberal and Country League member for Gouger, based on Balaklava, at the 1959 election. Quickly gaining a reputation for his independence and strength of his views, Hall rose through the Liberal and Country League parliamentary ranks to assume party leadership following Premier Thomas Playford&#x27;s retirement in July 1966. Playford, who had earlier served as Premier for 26 years, endorsed Hall as his successor. Although Hall was considerably more progressive than Playford, the two men shared a background as small farmers, rather than members of the rural elite or the Adelaide Establishment. Playford realised that the LCL needed a new image and new leader to broaden its appeal.

Hall served as Leader of the Opposition for two years before leading the Liberal and Country League into the 1968 election. Considered young and handsome, he was also the first Australian state premier to sport sideburns. Indeed, the 1968 election, fought between Hall and his Labor opponent Don Dunstan, was described by the Democratic Labor Party as the battle of &quot;the matinee idols&quot;. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labor and the Liberal and Country League winning 19 seats each. Liberal and Country League-leaning independent Tom Stott announced his support for the Liberal and Country League. Dunstan and Labor were defeated in the legislature on 17 April, and Hall was sworn in as Premier later that day.

Hall immediately set out to deal with the issue of electoral reform. Deliberately inequitable electoral boundaries, commonly known as the Playmander, had greatly advantaged the Liberal and Country League over the past 40 years. Since 1932, the House of Assembly had 39 members—13 from the Adelaide area and 26 from country areas. However, by the 1960s, even though Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the state&#x27;s population, a vote in Adelaide was effectively worth only half a country vote. Hall was highly embarrassed that the Liberal and Country League had been in a position to win government despite winning 43.8% of the first preference vote compared to Labor&#x27;s 52%. He was also concerned by the level of publicity and growing public protest about the issue. This made him all the more committed to the principle of a fairer electoral system.

Hall sponsored an electoral reform Bill which expanded the House of Assembly to 47 seats, including 28 in the Adelaide area. It fell short of &quot;one vote one value,&quot; as Dunstan and Labor had demanded, since rural areas were still overrepresented. As mentioned above, Adelaide now contained two-thirds of the state&#x27;s population. Nevertheless, it was a much fairer system than its predecessor. Hall undertook this knowing that it would considerably strengthen Labor&#x27;s hand. Even at the height of the Liberal and Country League&#x27;s popularity under Playford, Labor had dominated Adelaide, with the Liberal and Country League only able to win a few seats in the &quot;eastern crescent&quot; and around Holdfast Bay. With Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature, conventional wisdom held that Hall pushed for electoral reform knowing that he was effectively handing the premiership to Dunstan at the next election.

In addition to electoral reform, Hall also introduced improvements in social welfare, Aboriginal affairs and abortion regulation. Hall also began the distribution of fluoridated water in South Australia in 1968.

Hall served as his own Treasurer for two months in 1970. Hall and Stott soon fell out over the location of a dam. Stott wanted the dam built at Chowilla in his electorate while Hall thought it more use to locate it elsewhere. Constituent anger forced Stott to vote against the Hall government, forcing an election in June 1970. As expected, Labor regained power, taking 27 seats to the Liberal and Country League&#x27;s 20. As a measure of how distorted the Playmander had been, Labor won easily despite picking up a swing of only 0.1 percent.

Hall remained Leader of the Opposition for two years before resigning from the Liberal and Country League on 15 March 1972, claiming that the party had &#x27;lost its idealism [and] forgotten...its purpose for existence&#x27;. He founded the Liberal Movement, a progressive liberal party that initially included about 200 former Liberal and Country League members. Hall and his fellow Liberal Movement members helped the Dunstan Government introduce adult suffrage and proportional representation for Legislative Council of South Australia elections.

After much of his base was transferred to the Yorke Peninsula-based seat of Goyder before the 1973 state election, Hall ran as the Liberal Movement candidate there and won.

===Federal politics===
Hall won a federal Senate seat for the Liberal Movement at the double dissolution 1974 election, after resigning his state seat, which sparked a by-election in his former seat of Goyder. At the Joint Sitting of Parliament, Hall supported the Labor government&#x27;s three electoral reform Bills, citing his experience as South Australian Premier. During the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, though opposed to the Whitlam government, Hall joined Labor (and independent Cleaver Bunton) in voting against the deferral of supply bills.

Hall was re-elected at the 1975 election. He became a member of the Liberal Party in June 1976 after the Liberal Movement reintegrated into the Liberal and Country League which was renamed to match with its interstate counterparts. He resigned from the Senate on 16 November 1977 to unsuccessfully contest the seat of Hawker in the House of Representatives. Premier Dunstan appointed Janine Haines of the Australian Democrats to replace him.

After four years out of politics, Hall won the 1981 Boothby by-election as the Liberal Party&#x27;s candidate.

In August 1988, after the then opposition leader John Howard expressed his wish to control Asian immigration in Australia,
Steele Hall (along with Ian Macphee and Philip Ruddock) dissented by crossing the floor of parliament and voting with the Labor government on a motion against the use of race as a criterion for selecting immigrants.

Steele Hall addressed the Parliament, saying:
:&quot;The question has quickly descended from a discussion about the future migrant intake to one about the level of internal racial tolerance. The simple fact is that public opinion is easily led on racial issues. It is now time to unite the community on the race issue before it flares into an ugly reproach for us all.&quot;

Hall held Boothby until his retirement at the 1996 election. He had been instrumental in blocking Liberal Senate leader Robert Hill to succeed him in the Liberal preselection contest for Boothby. The preselection went instead to Andrew Southcott, who succeeded Hall in the seat in 1996.

Unusually for a former state premier, Hall spent most of his time as a federal Liberal MP on the backbench. His long-standing antagonism to Malcolm Fraser kept him out of cabinet during the last term of the Fraser government. In Opposition, Liberal leader Andrew Peacock appointed him to the frontbench as Shadow Special Minister of State in 1983.

However, he returned to the backbench in 1984, where he remained for the remainder of his parliamentary career including when fellow South Australian Alexander Downer became leader in 1994. Hall had defeated Downer for Liberal preselection for the 1981 Boothby by-election.

==Personal life and death==
Hall married schoolteacher Anne Fletcher in 1956, with whom he had one son and three daughters. They were divorced in 1978, and later that year he married his research assistant Joan Bullock. The couple had one son and one daughter together. Joan was elected to the South Australian parliament in 1993.

Hall died on 10 June 2024, at the age of 95.

<text>The International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) is an international non-governmental organization devoted to international cooperation in the field of geology. As of 2023, it represents more than 1 million geoscientists around the world.

==About==
The IUGS was founded in 1961 to ensure continued collaboration between the International Geological Congresses, which have taken place every four years since 1875. It is a Scientific Union member of the International Science Council (ISC), formerly the International Council for Science (ICSU), which it recognizes as the co-ordinating body for the international organization of science. Currently geologists from 121 countries (and regions) are represented in the IUGS. A broad range of scientific topics are covered by its commission, task groups, joint programmes and affiliated organizations. IUGS promotes and encourages the study of geological problems, especially those of worldwide significance, and supports and facilitates international and inter-disciplinary co-operation in the earth sciences. The Union&#x27;s Secretariat is currently located at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences in Beijing, China.

==Activities==
IUGS is a joint partner with UNESCO for the International Geoscience Programme (IGCP) and also participates in the Global Geoparks Network (GGN). The Geological Society of London oversees the production and distribution of IUGS Publications. The Geological Society of India produces and distributes the Union&#x27;s quarterly journal, entitled &quot;Episodes&quot;, as well as providing editorial support. Interested parties can download the latest issues of &quot;Episodes&quot; free of charge. Other activities include: Resourcing Future Generations (RFG), Young Reporters, Deep-Time Digital Earth (DDE).

===Commissions===
IUGS runs nine international commissions, covering the following topics: 
* Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI)
* Commission for Geoscience Education, Training, and Technology Transfer (COGE)
* Commission on Geoscience for Environmental Management (GEM)
* International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)
* International Commission on the History of Geological Sciences (INHIGEO) 
* Commission on Tectonics and Structural Geology (TECTASK)
* Commission on Global Geochemical Baselines (CGGB)
* Commission on Geoethics (CG)
* International Commission on Geoheritage (ICG)

===International Geological Congress===

The International Union of Geological Sciences is the main scientific sponsor of the International Geological Congress (IGC), which takes place every four years. The first congress was in France in 1878 where a few geoscientists gathered to share new finds and .tTm was to create a framework and a platform for geoscientists to meet at regular intervals. The event has been growing bigger with each congress.

Brisbane hosted the 34th congress in August 2012 and Cape Town the 35th in 2016. Delhi was to host the 36th in March 2020 as a collaborative effort by Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Because of Covid, the congress was postponed twice and developed online in 2021. The 37th was held in August 2024 in Busan. Canada won the bid to host the 38th IGC in Calgary in 2028.

===Lists of IUGS geological heritage sites===
To celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of its establishment, in 2022, IUGS published a list of 100 sites around the world that it holds to be significant in the development of the earth sciences. 

In 2024, IUGS published a second list of another 100 geological heritage sites.

==Awards==
The IUGS Scientific Awards of Excellence:
* IUGS – Émile Argand Award
* IUGS – James M. Harrison Award
* IUGS – Award for Geoscience Information
* IUGS – Award for Structural Geology
* Vladimir V. Tikhomirov History of Geology Medal by the IUGS Commission on the History of Geology (INHIGEO).

<text>Lieutenant General Lloyd Ralston Fredendall (December 28, 1883 – October 4, 1963) was a general officer of the United States Army who served during World War II. He is best known for his leadership failure during the Battle of Kasserine Pass, leading to one of America&#x27;s worst defeats of World War II, for which he was relieved of his command.

He was in command of the Central Task Force landings during Operation Torch in North Africa, and led II Corps during the early stages of the Tunisian Campaign.

In February 1943, while in command of the II Corps, his forces were defeated by German forces commanded by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim in the Battle of Kasserine Pass. After this debacle, Fredendall was relieved of command of II Corps by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in North Africa, and replaced by Major General George S. Patton.

In spite of being relieved of command, Fredendall was promoted to lieutenant general in June 1943, assumed command of Second Army and was greeted in the United States as a hero.

==Early life and military career==
Lloyd Ralston Fredendall was born on December 28, 1883, at Fort D. A. Russell near Cheyenne, Wyoming. His father, Ira Livingston Fredendall (December 7, 1846 – February 6, 1935), was on active duty in the United States Army when Fredendall was born. Ira became sheriff of Laramie County before receiving a commission in the Quartermaster Corps during the Spanish–American War. The elder Fredendall retired as a major in 1914, returned to active duty during World War I to supervise construction at several bases in the western United States, and retired again as a lieutenant colonel.

As a result of his father&#x27;s connections in the service and with local and state politicians, Fredendall secured an appointment from Wyoming Senator Francis E. Warren to enter the class of 1905 at the United States Military Academy (USMA). Described by a classmate as &quot;a very soldierly little fellow, but extremely goaty in mathematics,&quot; Fredendall performed poorly in math as well as in general deportment, and was dismissed after just one semester.

His mother persuaded Senator Warren to re-appoint Fredendall the next year, but he dropped out again. Although the senator was willing to nominate him for a third attempt, the academy declined to readmit him. Instead, Fredendall attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1903 to 1904 as a member of the class of 1907. He took the officer&#x27;s qualifying exam in 1906, and scored first out of 70 applicants. On February 13, 1907, he received his commission in the United States Army as a second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch.

After service in the Philippines and other overseas and stateside assignments, Fredendall shipped out to the Western Front with the 28th Infantry Regiment in August 1917, four months after the American entry into World War I. He held a succession of instructor assignments in the army&#x27;s schools in France, and commanded one of its training centers. He built a record as an excellent teacher, trainer, and administrator, and ended the war as a temporary lieutenant colonel.

==Between the wars==
The Armistice of November 11, 1918, saw Fredendall assigned, like many other officers, to a variety of staff and training duties. He was both student and instructor at the U.S. Army Infantry School; was a 1923 distinguished graduate (placing 31 out of 151) of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School; and in 1925, he graduated from the U.S. Army War College. He also completed tours of duty in Washington at the Statistics Branch, the Inspector General&#x27;s Department (September 1934 to March 1936) and as executive officer (XO), Office of the Chief of Infantry. These postings led to important contacts that later furthered his military career.

In December 1939, during World War II (although the United States was still neutral at this stage), Fredendall was promoted to the one-star rank of brigadier general, serving with the 5th Infantry Division. In October 1940, he was promoted to the two-star rank of major general, and given command of the 4th Infantry Division until July 1941.

==World War II==

Fredendall&#x27;s rise to military command in World War II was facilitated by General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff; and Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, the commander of Army Ground Forces, a friend and colleague. McNair had included Fredendall on a list of the top three generals he believed capable of commanding all U.S. Army forces being sent to Britain. Marshall, in turn, had recommended the swaggering Fredendall to Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower for a major command in the Allied invasion of North Africa, codenamed Operation Torch.

General Marshall was especially fond of the youthful-looking, cocky Fredendall, describing him as &quot;one of the best&quot; and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, &quot;I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.&quot; Fredendall himself was convinced that neither Eisenhower nor his deputy, Major General Mark W. Clark, wanted him in Africa since he was above both in pre-war rank. However, with such glowing testimonials from senior commanders, Eisenhower chose Fredendall to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch. Eisenhower cabled Marshall on November 12, 1942, four days after the invasion, &quot;I bless the day you urged Fredendall upon me and cheerfully acknowledge that my earlier doubts of him were completely unfounded.&quot; Eisenhower, in notes dictated to Harry C. Butcher on December 12, 1942, said, &quot;…Patton I think comes closest to meeting every requirement made on a commander. Just after him I would, at present, rate Fredendall, although I do not believe the latter has the imagination in foreseeing and preparing for possible jobs of the future that Patton possesses.&quot; Eisenhower later came to regret both this assessment and his selection of Fredendall for the command.

Fredendall was described by General Lucian Truscott as:

===Tunisia, Oran, and Kasserine Pass===
After the Torch landings, Fredendall became the &quot;de facto&quot; military governor in Oran. Orders from his headquarters in the Grand Hotel of Oran were headed with &quot;II Corps – In the Field,&quot; which prompted derision from his troops, who were living in spartan conditions.

Fredendall was assigned to command the U.S. II Corps in its advance into Tunisia against German forces. (He thus became the second-oldest of the 34 generals to serve as a U.S. Army corps commander in World War II, after Innis P. Swift, commander of the I Corps in the Pacific.) II Corps served under the British First Army, whose commander, Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson, considered Fredendall incompetent well before the loss at Kasserine. Fredendall was given to speaking and issuing orders using his own slang, such as calling infantry units &quot;walking boys&quot; and artillery &quot;popguns.&quot; Instead of using the standard military map grid-based location designators, he made up confusing codes such as &quot;the place that begins with C.&quot; This practice was unheard-of for a general and distinguished graduate of the Command and General Staff School, who had been taught to always use standardized language and procedures to ensure clarity when transmitting orders under the stress of combat. Fredendall&#x27;s informality often led to confusion among his subordinates, and precious time was lost attempting to discern his meaning.

During the advance into Tunisia, Fredendall used an engineer company of the 19th Engineer Regiment to build a large, dug-in corps headquarters bunker behind the front in a place called Speedy Valley (nine miles southeast of Tébessa). Blasted and drilled out of solid rock, the bunker (actually two U-shaped complexes running into the hillside) took three weeks to construct. An anti-aircraft battalion was emplaced to protect the headquarters. Fredendall also ordered a bulletproof Cadillac similar to Eisenhower&#x27;s, and regularly phoned Oran to find out why it was not being delivered faster. Then-Brigadier General Omar Bradley called the headquarters &quot;an embarrassment to every American soldier,&quot; and General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in North Africa, after viewing the elaborate structure, reminded his senior commanders that even generals must assume personal risk in combat. Fredendall rarely visited the front lines, and had a habit of disregarding advice from commanders who had been farther forward and had actually reconnoitered the terrain. He split up units and scattered them widely, and at critical defense points had positioned U.S. forces (against advice) too far apart for mutual support or effective employment of artillery, the strongest American arm.
During the Battle of Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower sent Major General Ernest N. Harmon to report on the fighting, to assist Fredendall and the other Allied commanders, and to determine whether Fredendall or his 1st Armored Division commander, Major General Orlando Ward, should be replaced. Harmon noted that Fredendall and his superior, Anderson, rarely saw each other, and failed to properly coordinate and integrate forces under their command. Fredendall was barely on speaking terms with Ward, whom he had deliberately left out of operational meetings after Ward had repeatedly protested the separation of his command into weaker &#x27;penny packet&#x27; forces distributed across various sectors of the front.

Allied forces were bereft of air support during critical attacks, and were frequently positioned by the senior command in positions where they could not support each other. Subordinates later recalled their utter confusion at being handed conflicting orders, not knowing which general to obey—Anderson or Fredendall. While interviewing field commanders, Harmon heard much criticism over what many Allied officers viewed as a cowardly, confused, and out-of-touch command. Noting that Fredendall seemed out of touch (and at one point, intoxicated), he requested and received permission to go to the front and intervene where necessary to shore up Allied defenses.

On March 5, 1943, after the American rout at Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower visited II Corps headquarters and conferred with Brigadier General Bradley. Eisenhower asked &quot;What do you think of the command here?&quot; Bradley&#x27;s response was &quot;It&#x27;s pretty bad. I&#x27;ve talked to all the division commanders. To a man they&#x27;ve lost confidence in Fredendall as the corps commander.&quot; British General Sir Harold Alexander, the 18th Army Group commander, informed Eisenhower that he would welcome a replacement for Fredendall. Eisenhower offered the II Corps command to Harmon, who declined on the grounds that it would be unethical to appear to personally benefit from his negative assessment of Fredendall.

Eisenhower then decided on Major General George S. Patton as Fredendall&#x27;s replacement. On March 5, 1943, Eisenhower personally flew to Tebessa to inform Fredendall of his decision to replace him, which he couched in terms of a routine reassignment. Eisenhower arranged the replacement so that Fredendall&#x27;s reputation was not formally brought into disrepute, an action some believe he soon came to regret. On March 6, 1943, Patton replaced Fredendall. When Patton arrived at II Corps headquarters, Fredendall was at breakfast. Patton had disliked Fredendall in 1941 when they were both division commanders at Fort Benning, Georgia. After a brief conference, Patton formally relieved him, saying II Corps &quot;was primarily a tank show and I know more about tanks.&quot; Patton noted in his diary that Fredendall was &quot;Very nice, conducted himself well – very well.&quot; In a letter to his wife Beatrice that day, Patton even wrote that &quot;Fredendall is a great sport, and I feel sure, is a victim largely due to circumstances beyond his control.&quot; However, only a week later, after an initial inspection of his new command, Patton had completely changed his mind: &quot;I cannot see what Fredendall did to justify his existence.&quot; Fredendall was the first of seven American corps commanders in World War II to be &quot;relieved of command&quot;, most for medical reasons.

In his after-action report for the Kasserine battles, the 2nd Armored Division commander, Major General Ernest N. Harmon, called Fredendall both a moral and physical coward and later said he was &quot;a son of a bitch&quot;.

===Reassignment and stateside duty===
At Eisenhower&#x27;s recommendation, Fredendall returned to the United States. Eisenhower&#x27;s aide made a report on Fredendall to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in which he communicated, without elaboration, Eisenhower&#x27;s view that Fredendall should be reassigned to a training command. As a result, Fredendall spent the rest of the war in command of the Second Army which was responsible for training in the eastern United States. Because he had not been formally reprimanded by Eisenhower, he was eligible for appointment to lieutenant general and three-star assignment, which he duly received, along with a hero&#x27;s welcome on his return to the United States. His promotion became effective in June 1943.

While commanding the Central Defense Command and the U.S. Second Army at Memphis, Tennessee, Fredendall supervised training and field maneuvers, gave away brides, and at first even granted interviews to members of the press. However, after a sarcastic comment on his generalship by a &quot;Time&quot; magazine reporter, Fredendall changed his mind, and largely blocked further press coverage of his command. The widespread custom of theater commanders to transfer senior commanders who had failed in battlefield assignments to stateside training commands did not in any way improve the reputation or morale of the latter, who were now saddled with the difficult job of convincing a disgraced commander to take the lead in advocating radical improvements in existing army training programs—programs which, like Fredendall himself, had contributed to the embarrassing U.S. Army reverses in North Africa.

Author Charles B. MacDonald described Fredendall as a &quot;man of bombast and bravado in speech and manner [who] failed to live up to the image he tried to create.&quot; Historian Carlo D&#x27;Este has described Fredendall as &quot;one of the most inept senior officers to hold a high command during World War II.&quot; 

Fredendall served through the end of the war in 1945, and retired on March 31, 1946.

==Death==
Fredendall died in San Diego, California, on October 4, 1963. He is interred at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery Officers Sections, Site 52-A, along with his wife Crystal Daphne Chant (July 23, 1890 – April 30, 1972).

==In popular culture==
In &quot;The New Normal&quot;, an episode of the television series &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;, New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan negatively reviews the performance of a precinct commander by drawing a parallel between the captain&#x27;s poor leadership of his precinct and Fredendall&#x27;s conduct at Kasserine Pass.

Fredendall was portrayed by William Boyett in &quot;&quot;.

<text>&quot;Oregon, My Oregon&quot; is the regional anthem of the U.S. state of Oregon. Written for a song contest in 1920, the 16-line, 2-verse song became the state&#x27;s official state song in 1927.

The lyrics, widely considered to convey racist sentiments, were updated by an act of the Oregon Legislature in 2021.

==History==
In 1920, the Society of Oregon Composers held a competition to select a state song for Oregon. The winning entry, &quot;Oregon, My Oregon,&quot; was a collaboration between John Andrew Buchanan, who wrote the lyrics, and Henry Bernard Murtagh, who composed the music. Buchanan was an amateur lyricist who was an Astoria city judge, while Murtagh was a professional musician with a Broadway credit, but who was best known as a professionally trained theatre organist on the West Coast during the silent movie era.

Following the song&#x27;s selection, the Society promoted the song by conducting performances at public gathering spaces around the state and at schools and universities (the state Superintendent of Public Instruction had endorsed the song).

On February 12, 1927, the song was officially adopted as the state song by a joint resolution of the Oregon State Legislature.

In 2009, legislator Gene Whisnant proposed choosing a new official state song. In 2017, a bill proposed in the Oregon Legislative Assembly sought to update the song&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;to reflect cultural, historical, economic and societal evolution&quot; of the state.

==Description==
Buchanan&#x27;s lyrics contain two main themes: honoring the early settlers and pioneers of Oregon, and praise for the natural beauty of the state. Murtagh composed the song as a march in F major. Unlike two other similarly named state songs—&quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; and &quot;Michigan, My Michigan&quot;—&quot;Oregon, My Oregon&quot; is not set to the tune of &quot;O Tannenbaum.&quot;

On June 6, 2021, the Oregon Legislature approved changes to the lyrics of Oregon&#x27;s state song. Amy Donna Shapiro, an Oregonian, replaced &quot;Land of the Empire Builders, Land of the Golden West; Conquered and held by free men, Fairest and the Best&quot; in the first verse with &quot;Land of Majestic Mountains, Land of the Great Northwest; Forests and rolling rivers, Grandest and the best&quot;, and &quot;Blest by the blood of martyrs&quot; in the second verse with &quot;Blessed by the love of freedom&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Onondaga&quot; was an ironclad monitor built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War. Commissioned in 1864, the ship spent her entire active career with the James River Flotilla covering the water approaches to the Confederate States capital of Richmond, Virginia, although her only notable engagement was the Battle of Trent&#x27;s Reach. After the war, she was purchased by France where she served as a coastal defense ship in the French Navy ().

&quot;Onondaga&quot; saw little active service with the French, spending most of the next four decades in reserve, although she was mobilized during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. The monitor became a guard ship in 1898, but she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap in 1904; the ship was demolished in 1905.

==Description==
&quot;Onondaga&quot; had an overall length of and a beam of . She was overweight and her draft of was almost a foot deeper than intended. The ship had a depth of hold of , a tonnage of 1,250 tons burthen and displaced . Her crew consisted of 130 officers and enlisted men. &quot;Onondaga&quot; was powered by a pair of two-cylinder horizontal back-acting steam engines, built by the Morgan Iron Works, each driving one propeller using steam generated by four vertical water-tube boilers. The engines had a combined rating of that gave the ship a speed of . She carried of coal which gave her a range of . The propellers were protected from underwater obstacles by iron rings.

The monitor&#x27;s main battery consisted of a pair of smoothbore, muzzle-loading, Dahlgren guns and another pair of 150-pounder () Parrott rifles. One of each type was mounted in the two twin-gun turrets. Her pilothouse was built on the roof of the forward turret. Steam power to rotate each turret was provided by a two-cylinder donkey engine. The nine-caliber Dahlgren guns weighed . They could fire a shell up to a range of at an elevation of +5°. The Parrott rifles were 17 calibers long and weighed . Their projectiles had a range of at the same elevation.

As designed the exposed area of the hull was protected by wrought-iron plates, but John Ericsson, designer of the , suggested that the side armor be reinforced with additional wood inside the armor belt in April 1863. As most of the armor had already been mounted by this time, the shipyard simply added of wood to the exterior of the armor and sheathed it with a armor plate. The weight of the wood was partially responsible for increasing &quot;Onondaga&quot;″s draft by almost a foot more than was designed. The armor of the turrets and the pilot house atop the forward turret consisted of layers of armor plates totaling in thickness. A soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turrets to prevent shells and fragments from jamming them as had happened during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. &quot;Onondaga&quot;″s deck was protected by two layers of one-inch plates and the base of the funnel was armored as well.

==Construction and career==

The Navy solicited bids for a twin-turret ironclad for harbor and coastal service on 20 February 1862 and accepted George W. Quintard&#x27;s design that generally followed the specifications, albeit built in iron rather than wood and using Ericsson&#x27;s turrets rather than those designed by Cowper Coles. The Navy ordered &quot;Onondaga&quot; from Quintard on 25 May at a cost of $625,000; he was the manager of the Morgan Iron Works and built the engines while sub-contracting the rest of the ship to the Continental Iron Works, also in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

&quot;Onondaga&quot;, the first U.S. Navy ship to bear the name, was launched on 29 July 1863 and was sponsored by Sally Sedgwick, daughter of former U.S. Representative Charles B. Sedgwick. She was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 24 March 1864 with Captain Melancthon Smith in command. Construction was delayed by shortages of material, labor and the closing of the shipyard during the New York City draft riots in July 1863. The ship cost $759,673.08, a budget overrun of almost 22 percent.

Escorted by the gunboat , the ship departed New York City on 21 April and arrived at Hampton Roads in Union-occupied Virginia two days later. Assigned to the James River Flotilla, she supported General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s drive on Richmond, Virginia. Together with the other ships of the flotilla, &quot;Onondaga&quot; patrolled the river and occasionally engaged Confederate artillery batteries on the river.
=== Battle of Trent&#x27;s Reach ===
Early in January 1865, most of the Union ironclads were withdrawn from the James River as Rear Admiral David D. Porter assembled most of his ships for the forthcoming attack on Fort Fisher, North Carolina. &quot;Onondaga&quot; was the only ironclad left to guard Union forces along the James against the Confederate James River Squadron.

When the Confederate squadron steamed down river to attack the weakened Union forces, &quot;Onondaga&quot; dropped downstream to a position where she could maneuver more easily. She and her supporting gunboats awaited them only to see the attack aborted when elements of the Confederate fleet—the casemate ironclads &quot;Virginia II&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot;, the gunboat &quot;Drewry&quot;, and the torpedo boat &quot;Scorpion&quot;—all ran aground as the tide ebbed trying to pass Union obstructions at Trent&#x27;s Reach, after the casemate ironclad &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; and the gunboat &quot;Hampton&quot; had passed through the obstruction at 01:30. The latter two ships continued downriver and anchored below the Dutch Gap Canal to await the rest of the squadron.

The squadron commander, Flag Officer John K. Mitchell, recalled them several hours later and ordered them to anchor further upstream under the guns of Battery Dantzler. As the Confederate ships were refloated at 10:45, &quot;Onondaga&quot; approached the Union obstructions and opened fire at an estimated range of . Her Dahlgren guns hit &quot;Virginia II&quot; twice with solid shot; the first shot penetrated her armor and badly damaged the wooden backing and its supporting beams. The second shot killed one crewman and killed two others as it penetrated the armor and its backing. &quot;Richmond&quot; was only hit by a glancing shot that damaged the armored shutter that protected the ship&#x27;s stern gun port before the Confederate ships were able to withdraw upriver.

The decision to move &quot;Onondaga&quot; downstream resulted in her commanding officer, Commander William Parker, being court-martialled for &quot;neglect of duty in not offering battle to the Confederate ironclads&quot; during this engagement. Secretary Welles set aside the guilty verdict on a technicality.
&quot;Onondaga&quot; continued to support Union troops for the rest of the war and steamed north after its end on 9 April. The ship was decommissioned at New York City on 8 June and was laid up at League Island, Pennsylvania. By an Act of Congress approved on 7 March 1867, the monitor was sold to back to her builder who resold her to France for 4,330,599 francs.

=== French service===

&quot;Onondaga&quot; retained her name in French service and was towed from New York City to Halifax beginning on 2 September 1867. She was towed across the Atlantic to Brest by the transport departing on 15 June 1868, escorted by the aviso . The ship began an extensive refit after her arrival on 2 July that include the replacement of her original armament with four Modèle 1864 or Modèle 1864-66 rifled breech-loading guns. Other alterations included reworking her hull sides with teak backing the armor, a larger rudder and, probably, removal of the rings around the propellers. The French measured her freeboard at although it is uncertain if this was before or after these modifications. &quot;Onondaga&quot; began her sea trials in May 1869 and was subsequently placed in reserve.

The ship was mobilized on 17 July 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, but saw no combat and returned to reserve afterwards. Her armament was augmented in 1878 by six Hotchkiss 5-barreled revolving cannon, two towed Harvey torpedoes and a torpedo launch. In April 1898 she became the guard ship of the Naval Reserve () at Saint-Malo and her light guns were replaced by a dozen Hotchkiss guns, half-a-dozen each of and calibers. &quot;Onondaga&quot; was stricken on 2 December 1904 and was subsequently sold for 127,550 francs. The ship was scrapped in Brest in 1905.

<doc id="1117114" wikidata="Q756317" url="?curid=1117114" title="Point of Entry">
<text>Point of Entry is the seventh studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 27 February 1981 by Columbia Records. Following the commercial success of their previous album &quot;British Steel&quot; (1980), Priest pursued a more radio-friendly direction on &quot;Point of Entry&quot;. Following the conclusion of the British Steel Tour, the band began work on their next project. By this time, the band possessed sufficient funds to fly all their equipment to the state-of-the-art Ibiza Studios in Spain. This gave &quot;Point of Entry&quot; a louder, stronger, more &quot;live&quot; sound than previous Judas Priest albums.

==Promotion==
Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Heading Out to the Highway&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot; and &quot;Hot Rockin, all of which had accompanying music videos. The song &quot;Heading Out to the Highway&quot; has been a staple in live shows since its release, &quot;Desert Plains&quot; was regularly played throughout the 1980s and in 2002 and &quot;Hot Rockin was returned to the setlist for the 2005 Reunited Tour, where Priest also played &quot;Solar Angels&quot; on rare occasions. On the World Wide Blitz Tour of 1981 supporting &quot;Point of Entry&quot;, &quot;Solar Angels&quot; had been the opening song of every show, while &quot;Troubleshooter&quot; was also performed on parts of the supporting tour. On the contrary, five songs from the album – &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, &quot;Turning Circles&quot;, &quot;You Say Yes&quot;, &quot;All the Way&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot; – have never been performed live.

==Cover art==
The European distribution of the album features &quot;an intriguing and colourful sort of futuristic metal wing over a horizon shot&quot; designed by Roslav Szaybo, who had done all of the band&#x27;s CBS albums to date. The cover featured on the Canada, USA, Australasia, Brazil, Hong Kong and Japan markets, however, was designed by Columbia Record&#x27;s John Berg, and instead depicts continuous stationery paper to simulate the line in the middle of the road with white cardboard boxes on the back. &quot;The sleeve was awful,&quot; guitarist Glen Tipton said of the covers, &quot;and we&#x27;ve got to blame management for that because they didn&#x27;t shop around enough to get one that was suitable. The American cover was different, but that turned out to be even worse!&#x27;&quot; The latter version was once again used for the 2001 remaster of the album.

The American artwork also saw the introduction of the extruded &#x27;3D&#x27; Judas Priest logo, which would be used up to &quot;Turbo&quot;.

==Reissues==
The album was remastered in 2001, with two bonus tracks added, a live version of &quot;Desert Plains&quot; and &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, a track from the &quot;Ram It Down&quot; sessions.

In the booklet of the Remastered CD, the band states:

==Critical reception==
In 2005, &quot;Point of Entry&quot; was ranked number 352 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In the 2007 book &quot;Metal: The Definitive Guide&quot;, author Garry Sharpe-Young wrote that the album consists of &quot;radio-friendly fillers.&quot; Moreover, Sharpe-Young called the original British artwork &quot;bland&quot; and subsequent American alternative artwork &quot;an even worse compromise.&quot;

Opinions about the album from within the band were mixed. Bassist Ian Hill explained, &quot;It came across… people think it&#x27;s just a commercial album. And it&#x27;s not, there are some good songs in there. And I think it&#x27;s overlooked.&quot;. In a Louder article, it is noted that &quot;Halford admits to being &quot;dismayed&quot; by the reaction it received.&quot; In the same Louder article, K.K. Downing takes on a more mixed perspective, &quot;People don&#x27;t understand how pressurised we were by the label, either to do covers or make hits&quot;, he says. &quot;With that album, we gave them what they wanted.&quot; He cites the album as the worst he made with the band, &quot;But then again there are some great songs on that one. That&#x27;s so, so hard to answer.&quot;

<text>Alex Henteloff (born May 23, 1942) is an American actor.

Born in Los Angeles, Henteloff has appeared mostly on television in guest-starring roles, and usually made such an impression that he was invited back to appear in multiple episodes of the same series. He is perhaps best known as the aggressive attorney Arnold Drake Ripner in six episodes of the television series &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, and he guest-starred in a seventh episode in the character role of an expert forger. &quot;Barney Miller&quot; writer Reinhold Weege hired Henteloff for Weege&#x27;s subsequent series &quot;Night Court&quot; (four episodes). 

Henteloff appeared as Doug Porterfield in 14 episodes of &quot;The Betty White Show&quot; (1977-78). His many TV appearances include &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Streets of San Francisco&quot; (three episodes), &quot;Baretta&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Pistols &#x27;n&#x27; Petticoats&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot; (two episodes)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Soap&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; (four episodes), &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot; and &quot;The Young Rebels&quot; (in which he co-starred in its 15-episode run, in 1970). Henteloff appeared in the first season of Barnaby Jones (five episodes).

He was a regular on the 1973 situation comedy &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; playing Myron Russo. He also appeared in some feature film roles including &quot;Slither&quot; (1973), &quot;Hardly Working&quot; (1980), &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), and &quot;Payback&quot; (1999).

<doc id="1117126" wikidata="Q1428616" url="?curid=1117126" title="John Painter (supercentenarian)">
<text>John George Painter (20 September 1888 – 1 March 2001) was an American supercentenarian who was posthumously recognized as the world&#x27;s oldest man and oldest American veteran. He was also the first verified man who lived in three centuries (19th to the 21st centuries); Margaret Ann Neve was the first such person.

==Biography==
Painter was born on 20 September 1888, on a farm in Jackson County, Tennessee. As a child, he attended school and worked on the farm. Longevity ran in Painter&#x27;s family; his father lived to 99, and his siblings lived to ages between 87 and 105.

In 1917, at age 29, he enlisted in the United States Army. As a part of Battery D in the 115th Artillery Battalion, he hauled ammunition and artillery supplies, including field guns, transporting all the supplies on horses or mules. Painter saw action at the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Eighty days after the armistice was declared on November 11, 1918, Painter received the highest French honor, the Légion d&#x27;honneur award. He also received the Croix de Guerre and was one of only six Tennessee World War I veterans to be awarded the Tennessee Distinguished Award. Painter had to leave his son, Sean Humphrey Painter, when he went to war. He was discharged from service on April 12, 1919, after serving in the army for two years.

After his discharge, Painter pursued a career as a blacksmith and married his childhood sweetheart, Gillie Watson. The couple adopted two daughters. On 19 November 1999, Painter was recognized as the world&#x27;s oldest veteran at age 111. On 20 September 2000, Tennessee Representative Bart Gordon read a proclamation in honor of John&#x27;s 112th birthday.

Governor Don Sundquist also declared on his birthday &quot;John Painter Day&quot; in Tennessee

On March 1, 2001, John Painter died aged at his home in Hermitage Springs, Tennessee of a heart attack.

<doc id="1117127" wikidata="Q2465604" url="?curid=1117127" title="Parley P. Pratt">
<text>Parley Parker Pratt Sr. (April 12, 1807 – May 13, 1857) was an early leader of the Latter Day Saint movement whose writings became a significant early nineteenth-century exposition of the Latter Day Saint faith. Named in 1835 as one of the first members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Pratt was part of the Quorum&#x27;s successful mission to Great Britain from 1839 to 1841. Pratt has been called &quot;the Apostle Paul of Mormonism&quot; for his promotion of distinctive Mormon doctrines.

Pratt explored and surveyed Parley&#x27;s Canyon in Salt Lake City, Utah (named in his honor), and subsequently built and maintained the first road for public transportation in the canyon.

Pratt practiced plural marriage. He was murdered in 1857 by the estranged husband of his twelfth wife. Pratt fathered thirty children. His living descendants in 2011 were estimated to number 30,000 to 50,000. He is the great-great-grandfather of Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican candidate for President of the United States, and Jon Huntsman Jr., diplomat and former Governor of Utah, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Russia from 2017 to 2019.

==Early life and education==
Pratt was born in Burlington, New York, to Jared Pratt (1769–1839) and his wife, Charity Dickinson (1776–1849), a descendant of Anne Hutchinson. He married Thankful Halsey in Canaan, New York, on September 9, 1827.

The young couple migrated west, where they settled near Cleveland, Ohio, where Pratt purchased land and constructed a home. In Ohio, Pratt became a member of the Reformed Baptist Society, also called &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;, influenced by the preaching of Sidney Rigdon. Pratt soon left his property to take up the ministry as a profession.

==Latter Day Saint service==

While traveling to visit family in western New York, Pratt read a copy of the Book of Mormon owned by a Baptist deacon. Convinced of its authenticity, he traveled to Palmyra, and spoke to Hyrum Smith. Pratt was baptized in Seneca Lake by Oliver Cowdery on or about September 1, 1830, formally joining the church. He was also ordained to the office of elder. Continuing on to his family&#x27;s home, he introduced his younger brother, Orson Pratt, to Mormonism and baptized him on September 19, 1830.

Arriving in Fayette, New York, in October 1830, Pratt met Joseph Smith and was asked to join a missionary group assigned to preach to the Native American tribes on the Missouri frontier. During the trip west, he and his companions stopped to visit Sidney Rigdon. They were instrumental in converting Rigdon and approximately 130 members of his congregation within three weeks. Pratt became close friends with the Smiths, particularly Joseph, with whom he would later experience persecution and imprisonment, including incarceration at Liberty Jail.

In early 1833, Pratt served as a missionary in Illinois. He went to Jackson County, Missouri, where through the summer he headed the School of the Elders, a gathering of about 60 men who studied religious and secular subjects, similar to the School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio. In the fall of 1833, he served as president of the Mormon branch number 8 in Jackson County and as a leader in the Mormon militia. He was among those Latter Day Saints driven into Clay County, Missouri, by mob violence. In February 1834, Pratt and Lyman Wight headed back to Kirtland to report on the events in Missouri to Joseph Smith. From Kirtland, Pratt traveled with Smith in Pennsylvania and western New York, preaching and trying to recruit people to serve in Zion&#x27;s Camp. After traveling together for three weeks, during some of this time with Pratt serving as Smith&#x27;s scribe, Smith returned to Kirtland from Geneseo, New York, for a court case. Pratt continued his missionary efforts along with Henry Brown. Pratt and Brown went to eastern New York to give his family members money to move to Kirtland. They went to Richland, New York, where Pratt convinced Wilford Woodruff, who had been baptized three months before, to join Zion&#x27;s Camp.

Pratt returned to Missouri later in 1834 as a member of Zion&#x27;s Camp. After Zion&#x27;s Camp broke up, Pratt rejoined his wife, Thankful, who had remained in Clay County while he had been traveling. While working as a day laborer, Pratt served on the Missouri High Council. Thankful had run up large debts in Pratt&#x27;s absence, and when he returned with her to Ohio, some felt he was trying to flee his creditors and criticized him for it. Pratt settled in New Portage, Ohio (now part of Barberton), where he was the leader of a group of Latter-day Saints there.

===More missionary service===
In 1835, after his call as an apostle, Pratt served with other apostles in a mission to New York, New England, and eastern Canada. Pratt preached in Upper Canada, in and around Toronto, in 1836. In 1837 and 1838, he preached in New York City.

Pratt later served as a missionary in the southern United States and in England, the Pacific islands, and South America. He moved to Chile to begin missionary work in Valparaíso. In 1852, Pratt and his family left Chile after the death of their child, Omner, without having had much success among the country&#x27;s Catholic residents.

In addition to having converted his brother Orson and preacher Sidney Rigdon, Parley Pratt introduced the Mormon faith to several future church leaders, including Frederick G. Williams, John Taylor and his wife, Leonora, Isaac Morley, and Joseph Fielding, along with his sisters, Mary and Mercy.

===Apostle===
In 1835, Pratt entered the leadership of the early Latter Day Saint movement when he was selected as one of the original Quorum of Twelve Apostles. While on a mission to the British Isles in 1839, Pratt edited the newly created periodical, &quot;Millennial Star&quot;. While presiding over the church&#x27;s branches and interests in New England and the mid-Atlantic states, Pratt published a periodical entitled &quot;The Prophet&quot; from his headquarters in New York City.

===Missouri War===
After serving as a missionary in New York City, Pratt returned to church headquarters in Missouri in 1838. He was arrested in November 1838, along with Joseph Smith, and was held in prison in Richmond and then Columbia until escaping on July 4, 1839. His writings during this and other imprisonments with Smith comprise many first accounts and stories preserved about Smith.

==Writer==

Pratt was a noted religious writer and poet. Many of Pratt&#x27;s writings are the only credible or lasting accounts from important American and Mormon events, such as the Hauns Mill Massacre and the events and conditions of imprisonment with Smith at Liberty Jail.

Pratt&#x27;s first printed work was &quot;&#x27;The Mormons&#x27; So Called&quot;, a 5500-word account of the persecution of Mormons in Jackson County in 1833.

Pratt wrote an autobiography, published after his death but likely his most widely read work in the 21st century. He published a book of poetry in 1835, the first collection of poems by a Latter-day Saint. Some of his poems have become staple Latter Day Saint hymns, some of which are included in the current hymnal of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Pratt wrote many of these hymns in 1839 while sailing to England to serve as a missionary. He was involved in compiling a hymnal with 40 hymns of his own work while editor of the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;.

In 1835, Pratt published a pamphlet about his missionary efforts in Mentor, Ohio. This work, entitled &quot;A Short Account of a Shameful Outrage&quot;, was the first pamphlet ever published by a Mormon.

One of Pratt&#x27;s most influential works was a book entitled &quot;A Voice of Warning&quot; (1837), first published in New York City. Givens and Grow say the book was &quot;a work that served the church as its most powerful proselytizing tool—after the Book of Mormon—for more than a century.&quot; Pratt made substantial revisions between the first and second editions after Joseph Smith voiced some reservations about it. The second edition of &quot;A Voice of Warning&quot; was published in 1839.

In 1837, Pratt, along with John Goodson, published the second edition of the Book of Mormon. It included Pratt&#x27;s testimony, along with that of the three and eight witnesses to the golden plates.

Near the end of 1837, Pratt published &quot;Mormonism Unveiled: Zion&#x27;s Watchman Unmasked&quot;, which is the earliest surviving response by a Mormon to an anti-Mormon writer.

Pratt also wrote one of the earliest Mormon works of fiction. His &quot;A Dialogue between Joseph Smith and the Devil&quot;, was published on January 1, 1844, in the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. It was a religious treatise in fictional form.

Pratt&#x27;s most well-known theological work was &quot;A Key to Science of Theology,&quot; which was published in 1855. Other works by Pratt included &quot;Late Persecutions&quot;, &quot;Millennium and Other Poems&quot;, at least ten tracts published while he served as editor of the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;, and &quot;Proclamation to the People of the Coasts and Islands of the Pacific&quot;, written by Pratt in the summer of 1851 in San Francisco, California, and published by W. C. Wandell in Sydney, Australia.

Pratt&#x27;s Visions and Poetry also serve as the text for many songs now found in the Latter Day Saint Hymnal. Pratt&#x27;s writings also corroborate many events and revelations which are found in a book of Latter Day Saint scripture known as the Doctrine and Covenants.

In total, Pratt is known to have written 31 published works, not including his posthumous autobiography.

==Journey to Utah==
After the death of Joseph Smith, Pratt and his family were among the Latter Day Saints who emigrated to what would become Utah Territory. They continued as members of LDS Church, under the direction of Brigham Young. Pratt helped establish the refugee settlements and fields at both Garden Grove and Mt. Pisgah, Iowa. He personally led a pioneer company along the Mormon Trail to the Salt Lake Valley.

==Life in Utah==
In 1849, Pratt was appointed one of the justices of the anticipated state of Deseret. He later served in the legislature of the provisional state of Deseret beginning in 1849. During this same time, as one of the seven members of the Quorum of the Twelve in Utah, he was among those who oversaw the division of Salt Lake City into wards and the organization of other wards in Utah.

Sometime in the mid-1850s, working with George D. Watt, Pratt helped develop the Deseret alphabet. In 1854, Pratt went to San Francisco, California, to preside over the LDS Church&#x27;s Pacific Mission.

After the organization of Utah Territory, Pratt served intermittently in the territorial legislature. In 1852, he was elected to the Territorial Council in a special election. He was re-elected in 1853, but only attended the 1853-54 session and did not return for the second year of his term. For the 1855-56 session, although not a member of the Council, he did serve as its chaplain. In 1856, he was again elected to a seat on the Council, but resigned before the session to leave on a mission.

==Death and legacy==

In 1856, Pratt went on a mission to the eastern United States. At that time, troubles were brewing in Pratt&#x27;s life. Hector McLean was the estranged husband of one of Pratt&#x27;s plural wives, Eleanor McLean. Pratt had met Eleanor in San Francisco, where he presided over a church mission. In San Francisco, Eleanor had joined the LDS Church and had also had her oldest sons baptized. Hector rejected Mormonism and opposed his wife&#x27;s membership in the church. Though they did not divorce, the dispute led to the collapse of their marriage.

Fearing that Eleanor would abscond to Utah Territory with their children, Hector sent his sons and daughter to New Orleans, Louisiana, to live with their maternal grandparents. Eleanor followed the children to New Orleans, where she lived with them for three months at her parents&#x27; house. Eventually, she and the children left for Utah Territory, via Texas; they arrived in Salt Lake City on September 11, 1855. She worked in Pratt&#x27;s home as a schoolteacher. On November 14, 1855, she and Pratt underwent a celestial marriage sealing ceremony in the Endowment House. She was the twelfth woman to be sealed to Pratt. For religious and cultural reasons, Eleanor considered herself unmarried at the time of her sealing to Pratt, but she had not legally divorced from Hector.

While Pratt was serving a mission in the eastern states, Eleanor went to New Orleans to get her children. Eleanor then took the children from her parents and headed to Texas. This was at the same time that Pratt was serving as a missionary in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Because Eleanor took the children, Hector blamed Pratt.

Hector pressed criminal charges, accusing Pratt of assisting in the kidnapping of his children. Pratt managed to evade him and the legal charges, but was finally arrested in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) in May 1857. Pratt and Eleanor McLean were charged with theft of the clothing of McLean&#x27;s children. (The laws of that time did not recognize the kidnapping of children by a parent as a crime.) Tried before Judge John B. Ogden, Pratt was acquitted because of a lack of evidence and Ogden&#x27;s own feelings after interviewing Eleanor. Ogden sympathized with Eleanor and Pratt, because he was so disgusted by Hector&#x27;s drinking and wife-beating. Shortly after being secretly released, on May 13, 1857, Pratt was shot and stabbed by Hector on a farm northeast of Van Buren, Arkansas. He died two and a half hours later from loss of blood.

As Pratt was bleeding to death, a farmer asked what he had done to provoke the attack. Pratt said, &quot;He accused me of taking his wife and children. I did not do it. They were oppressed, and I did for them what I would do for the oppressed any where.&quot; Pratt was buried near Alma, Arkansas, despite his desire to be buried in Utah Territory.

Some writers have viewed Pratt&#x27;s death as the act of a jealous husband, deeply angered by a man who had &quot;run off&quot; with his wife. A 2008 &quot;Provo Daily Herald&quot; newspaper article characterized McLean as a man who had &quot;hunted down&quot; Pratt in retribution for &quot;ruining his marriage&quot;. A 2008 &quot;Deseret News&quot; article described McLean as a man who had &quot;pursued Pratt across Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas, angry that his estranged wife, Eleanor, had become Pratt&#x27;s 12th wife.&quot;

Many Mormons viewed Pratt&#x27;s death as a martyrdom; his dying words were said to be, &quot;I am dying a martyr to the faith.&quot; A 2007 article in the &quot;Deseret Morning News&quot; said that &quot;Pratt was killed near Van Buren, Ark., in May 1857, by a small Arkansas band antagonistic toward his teachings&quot;. The historian Will Bagley reports that McLean and two friends tracked Pratt after he was released by Van Buren&#x27;s magistrate. Brigham Young compared Pratt&#x27;s death to those of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Other Mormons blamed the death on the state of Arkansas, or its people.

Due to Pratt&#x27;s personal popularity and his position in the Quorum of the Twelve, his murder was a significant blow to the Latter-day Saint community in the Rocky Mountains. Pratt&#x27;s violent death may also have played a part in events leading up to the Mountain Meadows massacre a few months later. After the massacre, some Mormons circulated rumors that one or more members of the party had murdered Pratt, poisoned creek water that subsequently sickened Paiute children, and allowed their cattle to graze on private property.

Pratt was one of the better known Mormons among other Americans; for instance, in his 1864-published visit to the Mormons, Fitz-Hugh Ludlow, in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; made a joke about &quot;Mrs. Deacon Pratt&quot; and referred to &quot;Parley&#x27;s Cañon (named after the celebrated Elder, Parley Pratt).&quot;

In 2008, Pratt&#x27;s family received permission from an Arkansas judge to rebury his remains in the Salt Lake City Cemetery, but no human remains were found at what was believed his gravesite. No further search efforts for Pratt&#x27;s burial site have been planned.

== Family ==
Pratt practiced plural marriage and had 12 wives, 30 children, and 266 grandchildren. In 2011, Pratt&#x27;s living descendants were estimated to number 30,000 to 50,000. His first wife, Thankful Halsey Pratt, died following childbirth in March 1837. (Thankful was a widow ten years older than Pratt when she married him.) Pratt did, however, marry women averaging ten years younger than himself, the greatest age difference occurring with his marriage to his Ann Agatha Walker who was 18 to his 40 years.

On May 14, 1837, Pratt married his second wife, Mary Ann Frost Stearns (1808–1891), a widow with a daughter. The marriage was performed by Frederick G. Williams. Mary Ann was a native of Bethel, Maine (part of Massachusetts until 1820) whose first relative to join the church was Patty Bartlett Sessions, later a prominent midwife in Utah. Mary Ann was baptized by David W. Patten. She had come to Kirtland as a widow in 1836. Joseph Smith later condemned Latter-Day Saints for &quot;marrying in five or six weeks, or even in two or three months, after the death of their companion.&quot; Pratt may have married Mary Ann so quickly to get back his infant son, although he remained in the care of Mary Ann Young for nearly a year after Pratt remarried. Mary Ann and Pratt at times demonstrated a deep companionship in their marriage, most fully shown by her joining her husband in prison in Missouri. After Pratt began practicing polygamy, they became estranged. Pratt suggested his falling out with Mary Ann was &quot;stung by falsehoods which are circulated in the Church&quot;.

Some sources state that in 1843, Mary Ann Pratt married Joseph Smith, the church&#x27;s founder. This marriage, however, does not appear on most lists of Smith&#x27;s marriages. That same year, Smith married at least 17 other women—including Mary Ann&#x27;s sister, Olive Grey Frost. Olive would marry Smith&#x27;s successor, Brigham Young, after Smith&#x27;s death in 1844.

Pratt made several attempts to get Mary Ann to join him in traveling west in 1846 and 1847, but after spending the winter of 1846–47 in an abandoned Nauvoo, she chose to return to Maine. Pratt provided her with clothes and money upon her return to Maine. She received some of the proceeds from the sale of Pratt&#x27;s home to a Roman Catholic priest; the Nauvoo home is still used as a residence for Catholic priests. In 1852, Mary Ann traveled to Utah Territory, but she and Pratt did not see eye to eye on how to raise their children. Mary Ann received a divorce decree issued by Brigham Young in 1853. Mary Ann then settled in what is now Pleasant Grove, Utah. She worked as a midwife, remained in the LDS Church, and became a leading advocate for Mormon women against the attacks of those opposed to polygamy.

In the fall of 1853, Pratt had seven living wives. These wives were:

Agatha ran a millinery business in Salt Lake City.

Other wives of Pratt:
*Martha Monks (1825–?). Married Pratt April 28, 1847. One child died shortly after birth. After this Martha abandoned Pratt in early 1849 and moved to California.
*Keziah Downes (1812–1876). Married Pratt on December 27, 1853. They did not have any children. She lived in the same house as five of Pratt&#x27;s other wives and helped them in raising their children.
*Eleanor Jane McComb (1817–1874). Married Pratt on November 14, 1855.

Pratt&#x27;s constant missions left him little time with his family. After he started practicing plural marriage, the longest period of time he had with his family were the 18 months following his return from a mission to Chile.

According to Terryl L. Givens and Matthew J. Grow, Pratt&#x27;s &quot;highest happiness was to be surrounded by a teeming domestic world of multiple wives and offspring.&quot; They noted that he also had an &quot;antisocial bent&quot;.

One of Pratt&#x27;s grandsons, William King Driggs, was the father of the King Sisters.

Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts governor (2003–07) and the 2012 Republican nominee for the U.S. presidency, is one of Pratt&#x27;s great-great-grandsons.

One of Pratt&#x27;s great-great-great-grandsons is Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor and Ambassador to China, and an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

Outside of politics, he was the great-great grandfather of animator Don Bluth, as well as his brother Toby Bluth.

== Memorials ==

<text>Thomas Sutherland (May 3, 1931 – July 22, 2016), Dean of Agriculture at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad members near his Beirut home on June 9, 1985. He was released on November 18, 1991, at the same time as Terry Waite, having been held hostage for 2,353 days, nearly six and a half years.

== Early life ==

Born in Falkirk, Scotland on May 3, 1931, Sutherland was signed as a 17-year-old by Rangers F.C. Sutherland obtained a BSc in Agriculture from the University of Glasgow, and moved to the United States in the 1950s. He received a master&#x27;s degree and PhD in animal breeding from Iowa State University, then taught animal science at Colorado State University for 26 years. 

== Abduction ==

In 1983, Sutherland moved to Beirut to take up a three-year term as dean of the faculty of agriculture and food science at the American University in Beirut. Despite the assassination of University President Malcolm H. Kerr and the kidnapping of Professor Frank Reiger in 1984, and repeated warnings from the State Department imploring him to leave Lebanon, Sutherland chose to remain at the University. Two weeks after David P. Jacobsen was abducted, Sutherland was also kidnapped while using the limousine of University President Calvin Plimpton. Upon his release in 1991, Sutherland claimed that the kidnappers mistook him for Plimpton.

==Aftermath==
He was the second-longest held captive after Terry Anderson. His memories of the experience were published in a book co-authored by his wife Jean, &quot;At Your Own Risk&quot; (). He claims to have attempted suicide a number of times and to have spent a substantial amount of time in solitary confinement.

In June 2001, the Sutherland family won a $323 million verdict in a lawsuit against the frozen assets of the government of Iran, because of evidence that Iran had directed terrorists to kidnap Americans in Lebanon. In accordance with Section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, , Sutherland and his family received $35,041,877.36 (including interest) and the lien for the rest of the original settlement is now held by the US Government.

Sutherland died on July 22, 2016, in Fort Collins, Colorado, aged 85.

<doc id="1117140" wikidata="Q7101685" url="?curid=1117140" title="Orewa Speech">
<text>The Orewa Speech was a speech delivered by the leader of the New Zealand National Party, Don Brash, to the Orewa Rotary Club on 27 January 2004. It addressed civil rights and race relations in New Zealand, particularly the status of Māori people. Brash approached the subject by advocating &#x27;one rule for all&#x27; and ending equitable measures and affirmative action for Māori, which he described as &quot;special privileges&quot;.

== Content ==
Brash covered many aspects of the status of Māori in New Zealand society in his speech. He criticized policies he believed to be separatist, such as required levels of iwi representation on district health boards and the allocation of Māori electorate seats in Parliament – something he labelled an &quot;anachronism&quot;. The speech made particular reference to the Labour Party&#x27;s stance on the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which Brash disagreed with. He also questioned the use of Māori spiritual traditions in official events and the open-ended nature of the Treaty of Waitangi settlement process.

==Reaction==
The speech was criticised by some people. Asked if he saw it as playing the race card, Brash said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t see the speech in that context at all.&quot; The speech itself was framed in terms of equality and pragmatism, arguing for dispensing with affirmative action programmes and poorly understood references in legislation to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, and ending the alleged &quot;Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry&quot;. His speech was criticised by lecturer and political writer Jon Johansson: &quot;Whether intended or not, the Orewa speech reinforced the ignorant and racist stereotype that Māori were &#x27;savages&#x27; before the &#x27;gift&#x27; of European civilisation was visited upon them.&quot;

The speech resulted in a surge in support for the National Party. From 28% in the polls a month before the speech, the National Party jumped to 45% two weeks after it: ten points ahead of Labour.

Polls showed that many Māori were comfortable with Brash&#x27;s speech, and the National Party threw its support behind it, but Georgina te Heuheu was removed as National&#x27;s Māori Affairs spokeswoman after criticising it. It was instrumental in establishing a public profile for Don Brash, who had only recently become the party&#x27;s leader.

Subsequent to the speech, Brash&#x27;s catch-cry &quot;need not race&quot; was taken up by the other side of the political divide, the governing Labour-Progressive coalition. An audit of government programmes was put in place to determine whether there were race-based programmes where need-based programmes would suffice.

Some former New Zealand Prime Ministers have criticized the speech. Jim Bolger said in an interview published in 2017 it was in the same &quot;frame&quot; as Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign, and that &quot;some people follow absurdities&quot;. Former Labour Prime Minister Helen Clark said of Brash&#x27;s motives that &quot;he would’ve done a lot of opinion polling on that, and knew it would strike a chord&quot;.

==Legacy==
Brash returned to Orewa on 25 January 2005, hoping to capitalise on the previous year&#x27;s success, and gave a speech on social welfare and on welfare dependency. This speech was dubbed &quot;Orewa 2&quot;.

<doc id="1117141" wikidata="Q576540" url="?curid=1117141" title="Orewa">
<text>Orewa () is a settlement in the northern Auckland Region of New Zealand. It is a suburb of the Hibiscus Coast, just north of the base of the Whangaparāoa Peninsula and north of central Auckland. The Northern Motorway, part of State Highway 1, passes just inland of Orewa and extends through the twin Johnston Hill tunnels to near Puhoi.

Tāmaki Māori settled in the Orewa area since at least the 13th century, utilising the resources of the Ōrewa River and Whangaparāoa Bay, where an important shark fishery was located. After the Kawerau warrior Maki unified many of the Tāmaki Māori people of the northern and western Auckland Region, his younger son Maraeariki settled along the Ōrewa River. Kawerau hapū, including Ngāti Kahu, lived in the Orewa area until the mid-19th century.

Orewa was a part of the Mahurangi Block, forest sold to the Crown in 1841. Kauri loggers and itinerant kauri gum diggers were among the first Europeans to come to Orewa, with the first permanent residents arriving in the 1840s and 1850s. Orewa House was constructed in 1856, becoming the de Jersey Grut family home for three generations, later run as a boarding house and accommodation by Alice and Edward Eaves. During the 1920s, Orewa became a popular destination for campers and holidayers.

Orewa rapidly developed suburban housing in the 1950s and 1960s, in part due to the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge, with the town centre and Hillary Square developing from 1953. Further major developments at Orewa occurred in the 1980s and 2000s, and Orewa became the administrative centre for the Rodney District from 1989 to 2010. The town gained national press in 2004 when National Party leader Don Brash gave the Orewa Speech, in which he discussed race relations between Māori and Pākehā.

==Geography==

Orewa is a coastal town on the Hibiscus Coast, located on the northern shores of the Ōrewa River. Ōrewa Beach lines the eastern margin of the settlement, which is one of the major beaches surrounding Whangaparāoa Bay. The highest point in Orewa is an hill in the Nukumea Scenic Reserve, from which the Nukumea Stream flows.

The beach settlement of Hatfields Beach is located to the north across the Nukumea Stream, South of Orewa heading towards the Whangaparāoa Peninsula is the suburb of Red Beach, and the Highgate and Millwater developments of Silverdale are located to the southwest.

Prior to human settlement, Orewa was primarily a kauri-dominated forest. By the 1840s, the Orewa beach was primarily sandhills, and likely had areas of peat swamp. Alice Eaves Scenic Reserve is an area of Orewa that includes remnant kauri forest, including one estimated to be over 300 years old.

==Etymology==
The name Orewa was originally used to describe the Ōrewa River and estuary, and was later applied to the beach during European times. The etymology of is unknown, but the most likely origin is that it is a shortening of (&quot;The Waters of Rewa&quot;), referring to an early Kawerau rangatira called Rewa. References to the Ōrewa River in English date from at least the 1840s,

===Māori history===

The Hibiscus Coast area has been settled since at least the 13th century, with many of the first Māori occupants identifying as Ngā Oho. The wider area between the Ōrewa River and Mahurangi River was traditionally known as Mahurangi, named after a pā located at the mouth of the Waiwera River. The Ōrewa River estuary features some of the most densely found archaeological sites in the area, and was an important sheltered harbour, which offered marine resources such as shellfish and flounder, and connections to inland walking routes. Portages, where waka could be hauled overland between waterways, connected the Hibiscus Coast area to the Kaipara Harbour in the west. The Aotoetoe portage travelled north between the Kaukapakapa River and the Ōrewa River.

Likely in the 17th century, the warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region. Maki conquered and unified many of the Tāmaki Māori tribes as Te Kawerau ā Maki, including those of the North Shore and Hibiscus Coast. After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū, including the wider Hibiscus Coast hapū of Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Poataniwha and Ngāti Kahu.

Maki&#x27;s younger son Maraeariki primarily settled at the head of the Ōrewa River. An island in the Ōrewa River adjacent to his kāinga, Te Motu-o-Marae-Ariki, was named in remembrance of him. His hapū Ngāti Maraeariki grew to occupy lands between Whangaparāoa and Ōmaha, while continuing to focus settlement at Orewa. By the mid-1700s, Marutūāhu tribes from the Hauraki Gulf, especially Ngāti Pāoa, sought to control the Whangaparāoa Bay shark fishery, and waged war against Ngāti Kahu, a hapū formed from Maki&#x27;s granddaughter Kahu, who were primarily based on the Whangaparāoa Peninsula. During this period, Kawerau-descended hapū held exclusive land rights to the Hibiscus Coast area, while fishing rights were shared between Ngāti Kahu and Marutūāhu tribes.

Orewa is home to two known defensive pā sites: Nukuhau Pā at Alice Eaves Scenic Reserve above the Nukumea Stream, which was held by Kawerau-descendant hapū. The second is Orewa South Bridge Pa, at the southern mouth of the Orewa estuary. Traditional names recorded for the area include Nukumea, the stream to the north of Orewa, Wahakataka, the northern tributary of the Ōrewa River at Arran Hills and Te Rua Taniwha, at the western end of the Orewa estuary. Te Rua Taniwha is associated with Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara ancestor Pokopoko-whiti-te-ra, who was famed for having slain a taniwha here.

In September 1821 during the Musket Wars, a Ngāpuhi taua (war party) ventured south to avenge past losses against Ngāti Kahu in the 1790s. The Kawerau-descendant tribes were heavily defeated, and survivors fled to the Waikato, gradually returning in the 1830s. On return, Ngāti Kahu formed intertribal marriages with Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara, seasonally migrating between Orewa, Te Haruhi Bay and Ōkura. Naval officer Byron Drury recorded a settlement at the mouth of the Ōrewa River in 1853 called Poaheke, where the residents had been influenced by Wesleyan missionaries. Ngāti Kahu settlement at Whangaparāoa continued until the 1870s.

===Early colonial era and holidaymakers===
Early kauri timber merchants were drawn to the Weiti River catchment to the south of Orewa by the late 1830s, The Ōrewa River catchment was used during the 1840s and 1850s to a lesser extent. Due to the former kauri forest, the Orewa area was a location that drew kauri gum diggers, who harvested the area until the early 20th century.

Following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, the Crown made the first purchases of the Mahurangi and Omaha blocks on 13 April 1841, which included Orewa. While some iwi and hapū with customary interests had been engaged, such as Ngāti Paoa and Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, others, including Te Kawerau ā Maki, Ngāti Manuhiri and Ngāti Rango, were not involved with transactions. This led to Ngāti Manuhiri being alienated from land on the Hibiscus Coast.

The earliest permanent European resident in Orewa is likely sawyer and boatbuilder John Ryan, who bought land in 1854 but had lived in the area since the 1840s. In the early 1850s, the Brunton family purchased land adjacent to the Orewa waterfall, establishing a home and jetty. The Brunton family constructed a bridge in 1880, and their house was home to the Orewa Falls post office.

In 1856, Captain Isaac Rhodes Cooper built Orewa House with the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot. This became the family residence of Channel Islands migrants, the de Jersey Gruts, in 1868, after the family struggled to establish a farm at Birkenhead. Orewa House was the de Jersey Grut home for three generations, becoming a commercial guest house in 1906. By the late 1880s, the clay road to Auckland was diverted to Wainui, leading the de Grut family to cut a road to Waiwera themselves.

In the latter 19th century as kauri gum deposits became rarer, land at Orewa was developed into orchards, where apples, pears, grapes and citrus fruit were grown for the Auckland market. Gradually the orchards were replaced by dairy farms in the 1920s, when fruit growing became economic.

In 1918, Francis Hitchins purchased the de Grut farm, selling Orewa House to Alice and Edward Eaves in 1919. Hitchins attempted to subdivide the farm, but land sales were disappointing, so onsold the farm to Dr. E. B. Gunson in the mid-1920s. Orewa became a popular destination for campers and holidayers in the 1920s, which led to the height of popularity of Orewa House. By the 1930s, coastal steamers were no longer the major form of transportation due to improved roading infrastructure, and in the 1940s Orewa Hall was constructed, where films were shown to the community.

===Suburban development===

Orewa was subdivided for suburban housing in the 1950s. The Orewa town centre was developed in 1953, which included a shopping precinct and Hillary Square. The square is named after Sir Edmund Hillary, whose family owned a holiday bach at Orewa, where he stayed in summers in the 1930s. This period saw the establishment of the Orewa Surf Life Saving Club in 1950, and the Orewa Bowling Club in 1952. In 1957, the Orewa Skating Rink was constructed. The rink developed into an entertainment precinct for the Hibiscus Coast in the 1960s, including a minigolf range and concert space. The rink was demolished in 1983.

Orewa experienced a building and population boom in the 1960s, due to the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge, rapidly urbanising between 1964 and 1975. In 1966, Alice Eaves Scenic Reserve was established on the former lands adjacent to Orewa House, after the Eaves family donated the land to the Waitemata County Council after Alice Eaves&#x27; death, and in the same year the Orewa Picture Theatre was constructed adjacent to Hillary Square.

In 1968, Alan Horobin opened Orewa Marineland, a home for rescue animals including chimpanzees, llamas, seals, dolphins and &quot;Sid the Sea elephant&quot;. Marineland closed in 1978. The Orewa Combined Business Association formed in 1970. The Orewa Community Centre was constructed in 1972. Development of the northern shores of the Ōrewa River began in 1983 with further developed in 1995.

A concrete statue by Marinus van Kooten of Sir Edmund Hillary was unveiled in Hillary Square in 1983. The statue degraded over time, and was replaced with a bronze statue by Chen Wei Ming in 1991. In 1990, the Centrestage Theatre was developed in Orewa by the United Players.

By the late 1990s, the Auckland Northern Motorway was extended to Orewa. This created a major link for the area back to the city. In 2004, a 12-storey apartment complex called the Nautilus was completed at Orewa. The only high rise building on the Hibiscus Coast, it is home to over 300 people, and in 2009 faced issues for being a leaky building.

Orewa made political headlines on 27 January 2004, when New Zealand National Party leader Don Brash, then the leader of the opposition in Parliament, gave what became known as the Orewa Speech in front of the local Rotary club on a theme of race relations in New Zealand and, in particular, the special status of Māori. He advocated &#x27;one rule for all&#x27;.

In 2008, Kensington Park, the former site of the Orewa Caravan Park, was developed into a new housing area.

From 1877 until 1974, Orewa was administered by the Waitemata County, a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. In 1974 the county was dissolved, becoming part of Rodney County, them from 1989 to 2010 Rodney District. Orewa was the administrative centre for the Rodney District. The Rodney District was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010, under a single unitary authority system.

Within the Auckland Council, Orewa is a part of the Hibiscus Coast subdivision of the Hibiscus and Bays local government area, governed by the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board. It is a part of the Albany ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

<text>The Wollemi Creek, a partly perennial stream of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, is located in the Central Tablelands and Blue Mountains regions of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==
The Wollemi Creek rises below Kekeelbon Mountains on the southern slopes of Mount Mounundilla, within the Wollemi Range, in remote country within the Wollemi National Park, north northwest of the locality of Putty. The river flows generally south southeast and south southwest, generally adjacent to the Putty Road, joined by seven minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Colo River in the upper reaches of the Colo Gorge, about south southeast of Glen Davis. The river descends over its course.

The upper Wollemi Creek has two main sources, one originating at about altitude east of Mount Monundilla, and the other due south of that mountain. Both flow through rough deep gorges at about in permanent dry weather flows, and fast flowing flood, until their confluence at about , due west of Putty, from where the creek flows eventually into the Colo.

The primary inhabitants of the upper creek are yabbies, eels, and possums. Some ancient massive gums populate the lower gorges and very few signs of non–native infestations are apparent, one notable exception being mistletoe which infests the upper branches of the oldest trees.

<text>Moore Park is a suburb in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney located from the CBD, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is part of local government area of the City of Sydney.

Moore Park is also a large area of parkland that is part of Centennial Parklands, a collective of three parks being Moore Park, Centennial Park and Queen&#x27;s Park. Centennial Parklands is administered by the Centennial Park &amp; Moore Park Trust, a NSW government agency. The only exception is the land on which the Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football Stadium are sited; these stadiums are managed by the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust.

==History==

Originally known as the Sydney Common it covered some 153 hectares to the South East of the town and was designated as one of Australia&#x27;s earliest parks in 1866, the following year it was named after Charles Moore, the Mayor of Sydney City Council. In 1867 several of the sandhills were levelled and three years later nearly half of the park was covered with grass. The straight lines of Randwick Road, which passes through the park, was fenced in and replaced the old curved road. In 1837 a new water supply was built to replace the polluted &#x27;Tank Stream&#x27; which had to that time been the colonists main supply of water. The new line connected the Busby Bore with water from the Lachlan Swamp in what is now known as Moore Park. 

Moore Park, was also the site of Sydney&#x27;s first Zoo. The Moore Park Zoological Gardens opened in 1884, and was run by less than a dozen people. Built in the area known as Billygoat Swamp, it was subject to flooding and creating problems for both keepers and the animals. As Sydney grew, so did the demand for a larger zoo. It was eventually closed down and the animals were moved to the Taronga Zoo, when it opened in 1916. Sydney Girls&#x27; High School and later Sydney Boys High School also occupied this site.

The Moore Park Toll House appears to have been built in 1849 and still exits on the corner of Anzac Parade and Cleveland Street. It is the only two story toll house in New South Wales.

== Heritage listings ==
Moore Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Driver Avenue: Sydney Cricket Ground Members&#x27; Stand and Lady Members&#x27; Stand

==Commercial area==

Moore Park is the former location of the Royal Agricultural Society&#x27;s Sydney Showground, which hosted the annual Sydney Royal Easter Show until 1998. It moved to Homebush Bay (the site of the 2000 Olympics). The old showgrounds have since been redeveloped as Fox Studios, now Disney Studios Australia, a commercial venture designed at supporting Australia&#x27;s film industry. The Entertainment Quarter is a retail, dining and entertainment precinct beside the studios. It contains cinemas, live venues, restaurants, cafes, pubs, and retailers of fashion and homewares. The Farmer&#x27;s Market operates every Wednesday and Saturday in the old showground showing.

The south-western corner of the suburb boasts the Supa Centre Moore Park on South Dowling Street. It specialises in showrooms for home furnishings and home renovations. This was the site of the former Dowling Street depot for trams.

==Transport==
The Eastern Distributor and Anzac Parade are major arterial roads on the western border of the suburb. Transdev John Holland operate frequent bus services to Moore Park from the Sydney CBD. Special services for sporting events from Central railway station have been replaced by services on the CBD and South East Light Rail from December 2019.

On 13 December 2012, the NSW Government announced a commitment to build a $1.6 billion light rail from Circular Quay down George Street to Central station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade. South of Moore Park the line splits into two branches – one continuing down Anzac Parade to the nine ways at Kingsford, and the other heading to Randwick via Alison Road. Construction commenced in 2015 and services commenced on the Randwick branch to Moore Park in December 2019.

==Sports stadiums and facilities==

Moore Park is the location of two of Sydney&#x27;s largest sporting venues, the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and Sydney Football Stadium (SFS). The Sydney Roosters Rugby league team in the National Rugby League, The Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League, Sydney FC A-League football team, NSW Waratahs rugby union team have their administration offices at Moore Park and Sydney Football Stadium is their home ground. The Moore Park Magpies are a local junior rugby league team.

The Hordern Pavilion is a multipurpose entertainment venue, while next door the Royal Hall of Industries (fondly remembered as the old Showbag Pavilion during the Royal Easter Show days) has hosted a range of exhibitions, social and commercial events and shows. Moore Park also houses Kippax Lake, an artificial lake named after William Kippax, an alderman of the 1860s and grandfather of the cricketer Alan Kippax, the ES Marks Athletics Field, the Moore Park Golf Course, the Parklands Sports Centre and a number of sports fields.

In October 2018, the Swans and the Government of New South Wales announced an intention to upgrade the Pavilion and Hall of Industries. The Hall was to be equipped with indoor sporting and rehabilitation facilities and an international-standard netball court, providing permanent indoor training facilities for the Swans and professional netball club the New South Wales Swifts. The Hordern Pavilion would retain its live music scene and undergo a significant restoration to improve facilities for patrons and performers. The two precincts would also be joined closer together with barriers between them removed and cafes and other community facilities installed for use by the general public. The Swans train on the Tramway Oval (previously known as Lakeside Oval), located adjacent to the Sydney Cricket Ground, during the non-football season. The oval completed an extensive redevelopment in April 2019 and has identical dimensions to Docklands Stadium in Melbourne. In April 2020 the Swans pulled out of the agreement with the Government and Swifts, citing the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement was renegotiated in August 2021, and completed in late 2022.

==Schools==
Moore Park, served by the Department of Education, is the location of Sydney Boys High School, Sydney Girls High School (both of which are selective high schools).

== Population ==
At the 2021 census, the population of Moore Park was 18.

The showed that Moore Park had a population of 28.

<doc id="1117157" wikidata="Q1138446" url="?curid=1117157" title="Centennial Park, New South Wales">
<text>Centennial Park is a suburb split between the local government area of the City of Sydney and the City of Randwick, located east from the Sydney central business district, in the eastern suburbs of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Centennial Park is home to a number of wild animals including birds, rabbits, and foxes. It is also home to a number of equestrian schools and other domestic animal endeavours such as the Centennial Park Rabbit Retreat, a boarding facility for rabbits in the Centennial Park and Paddington area.

== Geography ==
The western fringe of the suburb is used for residential purposes and is within the City of Sydney. It features quality houses on large blocks as well as large multi-unit buildings. The bulk of the suburb consists of the Centennial Parklands (from which the suburb takes its name) and is within the City of Randwick. The parklands extend further partly into the suburb of Queens Park, adjacent to (but separate from) the park of the same name in that suburb.

== History ==
Centennial Park started out as a reserve to protect the central ponds and swamps which formed early Sydney&#x27;s water supply. When it was superseded by the Nepean water supply system in the 1880s it was decided to create a large park, which opened as Centennial Park in 1888. Part of the funding was to come from selling off residential lots adjacent to the park, but this did not occur until 1904 when of land along the western border was subdivided. To ensure high standards of residential development, strict requirements were imposed. No wooden buildings or terrace homes were allowed; brick or stone were mandated, with tile or slate roofs. Between 1905 and 1925, a wide range of substantial, quality homes were built, featuring a mixture of Federation, Arts and Crafts, Victorian and Old English styles. The streets created were Martin Road, Robertson Road, Lang Road and Cook Road. Sections of the park were to be cleared in the 1970s for a sports complex but the project was called off after the NSW Builders Labourers Federation placed a green ban in response to a request from park users.

==Notable houses==

* Patrick White house (also known as Highbury), was the home of writer Patrick White for many years, until his death. It is heritage-listed.

<doc id="1117158" wikidata="Q7509097" url="?curid=1117158" title="Sidney Gulick">
<text>Sidney Lewis Gulick (April 10, 1860 – December 20, 1945) was an educator, author, and missionary who spent much of his life working to improve Japan–United States relations.

Gulick promoted Japan&#x27;s colonialism in Korea and China, and downplayed claims that Japan was aggressively invading China.

==Biography==
Gulick was born April 10, 1860, in Ebon Atoll, Marshall Islands. His father was missionary Luther Halsey Gulick Sr. (1828–1891), and mother was Louisa Mitchell (Lewis) Gulick (1830–1893). He was the brother of Luther Halsey Gulick, Jr. and grandson of the missionary couple Peter Johnson Gulick and Fanny Hinckley Thomas Gulick. He graduated from Oakland High School in 1879.
He received an A.B. degree from Dartmouth College with his brother Edward Leeds Gulick in 1883, an A.M. degree in 1886 and a D.D. degree in 1903. He also held D.D. degrees from Yale and Oberlin College.

He was ordained a Congregational minister in 1886, and then was a supply minister at the Willoughby Avenue Mission, Brooklyn. He married Cara May Fisher (1860?–1941) on November 7, 1887.

In 1888, Gulick traveled to Japan, where he worked for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions through the following twenty-five years. He became fluent in Japanese, and gave sermons and wrote books in it. He taught English, science, and religion at several schools and universities in Japan. In his last seven years there, he served as Professor of Theology at Doshisha University in Kyoto and as lecturer at the Kyoto Imperial University.

After returning to the United States in 1913, Gulick was dismayed to find growing discrimination and resentment against Japanese Americans. He campaigned against California&#x27;s anti-Asian legislation and urged equality of treatment for all nations. He promoted world peace, and was a vigorous proponent of the entry of the United States into the World Court.

Gulick actively defended Japan&#x27;s colonialism in Korea. After Japan violently suppressed the 1919 March 1st Movement Korean peaceful protests, it began a campaign to cover up and spread disinformation about its violent response. Gulick expressed some dismay at the disinformation campaign, but nonetheless participated in it. He placed partial blame on the Koreans themselves for the violent suppression of the protests, and promoted the message that Japan was on a noble civilizing mission in Korea. On the other hand, he advocated for the deescalation of violence and reform efforts to demilitarize Japan&#x27;s policies.

After passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, which virtually halted immigration to the U.S. from countries seen as &quot;undesirable&quot;, Gulick served a key role in founding the Committee on World Friendship Among Children. In 1927, its first project was to organize the sending of American dolls to Japan for Hinamatsuri, an annual doll festival. This project had a significant response from the American public, and altogether, 12,739 of these &quot;American Blue-eyed Dolls&quot; were sent to Japanese schools, each with an accompanying letter professing friendship. The Japanese later sent 58 dolls back to the United States – one for each state, plus more for states with larger populations. These Japanese friendship dolls were around three feet high, and were dressed in traditional Japanese clothing. They came with a trunk full of their belongings including equipment for the tea ceremony. After these dolls toured the United States, they went back to their state. During World War II, many of the dolls, especially the ones in Japan, were seen as the enemy and were burned or stabbed. Many people saved dolls by hiding them until the war was over.

Gulick wrote many books about Japanese-American relations.

He died in Boise, Idaho, on December 20, 1945. According to his grandson, Sidney Gulick III, &quot;his ashes were entombed in three places: alongside his father&#x27;s in Springfield, Massachusetts; in Boise, Idaho; and in Kobe.&quot; He had three sons, Luther Halsey Gulick (1892–1993) who developed theories of government policy, Leeds Gulick (1894–1975), and Sidney Lewis Gulick Jr. (1902–1988), and two daughters, Mrs. Leverett Davis and Mrs. John Barrow. His grandson mathematics professor Denny Gulick (Sidney Lewis Gulick III) has tried to revive the doll exchange project.

<doc id="1117164" wikidata="Q612298" url="?curid=1117164" title="Nobody Knows (2004 film)">
<text>is a 2004 Japanese drama film based on the 1988 Sugamo child abandonment case. The film is written, produced, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda, and it stars Yuya Yagira, Ayu Kitaura, and Hiei Kimura.

&quot;Nobody Knows&quot; tells the story of four children: Akira, Kyōko, Shigeru, and Yuki, who are aged between five and twelve years old. They are half-siblings, with each of them having different fathers. Because the three youngest children are in the apartment illegally without the landlord&#x27;s knowledge or permission, they cannot go outside or be seen in the apartment, and they do not attend school. Their mother leaves them alone for weeks, and finally does not return. Forced over time to survive on their own, they can only rely on each other to face the multiple challenges in front of them.

&quot;Nobody Knows&quot; was first shown at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May 2004. It was subsequently released in Japanese cinemas on 7 August 2004. The film received widespread critical acclaim, and it grossed over US$11 million worldwide. It won several awards, most notably Best Actor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival as well as Best Film and Best Director awards at the 47th Blue Ribbon Awards. At the time Yuya Yagira became the youngest Best Actor winner in the history of the Cannes Film Festival. It was Japan&#x27;s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Plot==
A young mother and her four children move into a small apartment in Tokyo. Only the eldest, Akira, is known to the landlord; he and his mother Keiko smuggle the youngest boy and girl, Shigeru and Yuki, into the apartment inside suitcases. The elder sister, Kyōko, comes separately by train. Each of the children has different fathers. Their mother does not allow them to go to school or be seen by others, and only Akira is allowed to go outside.

After a few months, Keiko tells Akira that she has a new boyfriend, and that after she gets married, the children can lead normal lives, but Akira seems doubtful. Without warning, Keiko leaves home and is away for months, leaving only a small amount of money for the children. Akira is forced to take charge of paying the rent and other expenses and caring for his younger siblings. When they run out of money, Akira goes to see several men who may be Yuki&#x27;s biological father and asks them for money. 

At length, Keiko returns, bringing all the children gifts, but soon leaves again. Though she promises she will be back in time for Christmas, she breaks this promise, and the season changes to the New Year and then to spring without her returning, forcing Akira and Kyōko into the roles of surrogate parents. Akira soon finds evidence that she has already married and left them forever, though he does not tell his siblings. Again running out of money, they are unable to pay their rent any longer and subsist on inexpensive food from the convenience store. On Yuki&#x27;s birthday, she asks to go outside to wait for their mother at the train station. The siblings enjoy a day out together, and though their mother does not return, Akira promises Yuki that one day he will take her on the Tokyo Monorail to see the airplanes take off at Haneda Airport.

Akira befriends two boys his own age at a game arcade who start frequenting the family&#x27;s apartment, playing games and roughhousing, and he begins to neglect his siblings. The apartment is falling into disrepair with no one cleaning or keeping up with other chores. When Akira and the two boys go to the convenience store one day, they dare him to shoplift. Akira refuses, and the two boys leave him. Several months later, when the two have entered junior high school, Akira comes by their school and invites them over to play, but they refuse, and Akira overhears them saying that his house smells like garbage. In an apologetic gesture, Akira takes his siblings to a nearby park to play and buys them candy and toys at the convenience store. They start a garden on the veranda of the apartment, planting seeds from wildflowers inside instant noodle cups.

Eventually the electricity, gas, and water in the apartment are all turned off. The children start using the public park&#x27;s toilet to wash themselves and the tap there for their water. On one of these visits, Shigeru starts a conversation with Saki, a high school student who is cutting class, which blossoms into a friendship between her and the siblings, and she begins to visit them and help Akira and Kyoko care for the family. However, when she tries to help Akira out of financial difficulties by offering him money obtained through enjo kōsai, Akira rejects it and runs away.

With summer approaching, the children have little money and are growing weary. Akira goes out one day to watch a junior high school&#x27;s baseball match. The team&#x27;s coach spots him and, short a player, asks him to sub in. Akira joins the game and enjoys playing baseball. While he is away, Yuki falls from a stool while trying to reach for something and dies. Akira goes to find Saki again, finally accepting her offer of financial support, and they buy as many boxes as they can find of Yuki&#x27;s favorite chocolate candies, which they place with Yuki&#x27;s dead body in a suitcase. With Saki&#x27;s help, Akira takes the suitcase to a field near Haneda Airport&#x27;s runway. They sit and watch planes come in, and then he and Saki dig a grave and bury the suitcase. They then return to the apartment, and the film ends with Akira, Kyōko, Shigeru, and Saki still together, walking home. Saki now has her hair in pigtails, almost like the longer pigtails Yuki used to wear.

===Development===
According to the director Hirokazu Kore-eda, though &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; was inspired by the true story of the Sugamo child abandonment case, it is not a factual recounting, and only the settings and the ending of the story are based on the true story.

Hirokazu Kore-eda had drafted and revised several screenplays for over 15 years. He also spent a very long time getting to know his subjects, and wanted the young cast members to interact, grow, and express their personalities freely, with as little adult dictation as possible. He did not use the usual structuring and cueing methods, but instead uses a discreet camera to show how children really live when no one is looking. Also, when the director discovered the actress Momoko Shimizu who played Yuki liked Apollo Choco more than Strawberry Pocky as was in the script, he changed his script to suit that and made her smile brighter. He chose not to make it a &quot;feel-good&quot; movie even though similar Japanese dramas often are. He avoided sentiment, aiming for a more stoic picture. This is because he wanted the audience to &quot;take away something&quot; from the film.

===Pre-production===
The director Hirokazu Kore-eda held extensive auditions to cast the four children, and the actors were all nonprofessionals. Also, during the casting, a little girl came in with noisy sandals. The director liked it so much that he brought it over to Yuki&#x27;s character when searching for her mother. He also did not give the children detailed explanations of their roles, because he wanted them to be natural.

===Filming===
The filming took over a year, lasting from autumn 2002 to summer 2003. The reel was filmed chronologically and 70% of the story was set in a cramped Tokyo apartment (with every room built specifically for the film). The apartment was specially rented for a year for the filming of this film, and the filming assistants lived in the apartment when it was not used for filming. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda said that during the long filming period, he tried to build a relationship of trust between himself and the children, and also amongst the children themselves. During the children&#x27;s filming breaks, the children were asked to write in their own journal entries about what they were thinking, ranging from the film to their own everyday concerns.

===Post-production===
&quot;Nobody Knows&quot; held its first public screening at the &quot;Le Theatre&quot; in Ginza, Tokyo on June 30, 2004 after the film debuted at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

===Music===
The soundtrack for the movie was written by the Japanese guitar duo Gontiti.

The ending song, &quot;Hōseki&quot;, was sung by Takako Tate, who also appears in the film.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

&quot;Nobody Knows&quot; has received widespread acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average ratings of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Tragic and haunting, a beautifully heart-wrenching portrait of child abandonment.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 88 out of 100, with all 31 critics giving positive reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;The Japan Times&quot; gave the film a rating of four out of five. The reviewer Mark Schilling describes the film&#x27;s young actors as &quot;superb&quot;, and said that the film &quot;faithfully reflects the fabric of the children&#x27;s lives over the course of a year&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; says that the film is &quot;too naturalistic, and too disturbing, to be a movie for children, but it nonetheless engages the audience&#x27;s wondering, childlike imagination as well as its worrying adult conscience&quot;. It further adds that &quot;It is also strangely thrilling, not only because of the quiet assurance of Mr. Kore-eda&#x27;s direction, but also because of his alert, humane sense of sympathy&quot;.

In a 2013 review of a later film by Kore-eda, Andrew Schenker of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; referred to &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; as the director&#x27;s best film.

In 2024, &quot;Looper&quot; ranked it number 46 on its list of the &quot;50 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time.&quot;

===Accolades===
Yūya Yagira won the award for Best Actor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. He was the first Japanese actor to win this category at the Cannes. The film had also won the &quot;Best One&quot; award for Japanese film at the 78th Kinema Junpo Ten Best awards. At the same award ceremony, You won the best supporting actress and Yūya Yagira won the best new actor award.

At the 47th Blue Ribbon Awards, &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; won the best film award. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda also won the &quot;Best Director&quot; award.

<doc id="1117168" wikidata="Q386874" url="?curid=1117168" title="Grose Valley">
<text>The Grose Valley is a rugged valley in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales, Australia. It has been formed by the Grose River, the headwaters of which are in the Mount Victoria area. The valley is located between the Great Western Highway and Bells Line of Road, the two major routes across the Blue Mountains. The majority of the valley falls within the Blue Mountains National Park.

==Grose wilderness features==

The Grose Wilderness contains some of the most dramatic gorge and canyon landscapes of the entire Sydney basin sandstone region. The Grose also constitutes one of the most accessible wilderness areas for bushwalking or public observation from its escarpment margins.

===Geology===
The geology of the area consists of Triassic sandstones and underlying Permian sedimentary rocks. A number of basalt-capped peaks dominate the area, notably Mount Banks and Mount Hay. The Grose River and its tributaries have eroded an extensive labyrinth of gorges and canyons through the Hawkesbury (upper) and Narrabeen (lower) group sandstones, exposing cliffs of commonly over and up to in height (Banks Wall). The Burramoko Head sandstone in the upper and middle Grose gorges possesses weathering tendencies of breakage along vertical joints and has consequently yielded some of the sheerest cliff faces in the Blue Mountains. The wilderness contains 80% of the Grose River catchment. The river flows to the Nepean-Hawkesbury through an undisturbed environment for all but its final . Consequently, the Grose has substantial wild river values, as do its major tributaries such as Wentworth Creek and Carmarthen Brook.
===Flora===
The bulk of the vegetation in the wilderness is dry open forest and woodland, dominated by &quot;Eucalyptus sieberi&quot; and &quot;E. piperita&quot; above altitude with &quot;Eucalyptus oblonga&quot;, &quot;E. globoidea&quot;, &quot;E. agglomerata&quot; and &quot;Angophora costata&quot; becoming dominant at lower altitudes. Plateau areas have thinner or waterlogged soils and generally support heath or low open woodland communities. Within the sheltered and well watered canyon environments closed forests commonly occur, with typical species being coachwood, sassafras and possumwood. On the isolated basalt caps the fertile soils support taller eucalypt forests of &quot;E. viminalis&quot;, &quot;E. blaxlandii&quot; and &quot;E. fastigata&quot;. A small area of alluvial sediments deposited in the upper Grose Valley during the Quaternary supports a tall moist open forest dominated by &quot;E. deanei&quot;, &quot;E. oreades&quot;, &quot;E. notabilis&quot; and &quot;E. cypelocarpa&quot;. The Blue Gum Forest is included in this forest type.

===Fauna===
The river is known habitat for platypus and certain hanging swamps provide habitat for the endangered and endemic Blue Mountains water skink (&quot;Eulamprus leuraensis&quot;). The rocky sandstone complexes of the plateau provide habitat for some specialised and rare native animal species (e.g. the broad-headed snake, &quot;Hoplocephalus bungaroides&quot;). Woodland communities are habitat for mammals such as the red-necked swamp wallaby, brush-tailed rock wallaby and eastern pygmy possum.

==History==

===Aboriginal history===
Aboriginal artefacts have been found close to the Blue Gum Forest.

===European history===

The Grose River has cut a deep gorge through the area as it makes its way east towards the Hawkesbury River. Sheer sandstone cliffs standing hundreds of metres above the river make for spectacular scenery and can be viewed extensively from the Blackheath area, where there are a number of accessible lookouts, the best known being Govetts Leap. The valley can also be viewed from lookouts near Bells Line of Road and points outside Mount Victoria. It is named after Francis Grose.

Charles Darwin described the Grose Valley as &quot;stupendous… magnificent&quot; when he visited in 1836. In 1859 some of the first photographs in Australia were taken in the valley. At various times there were proposals for rail lines and dams but these have not proceeded. In 1931, the valley was the subject of one of Australia&#x27;s first forest conservation battles.

Within the valley, the Blue Gum Forest is one place that stands out from the rest of the valley. It consists predominantly of towering Blue Gum trees (&quot;Eucalyptus deanei&quot;, also known as Deane&#x27;s Gums, or Broad-leafed gums), with a thin understorey because the tall trees inhibit the growth of ground cover by blocking most of the sunlight.
Protected by the Blue Mountains National Park, the forest can be accessed only on foot, with several trails from different parts of the Grose Valley and adjacent canyons meeting in the forest.
==Bushwalking trails==

There are a number of walks through the valley, with various entry, exit points and valley arms offering a range of permutations to explore. A moderate-grade day walk covering approximately in five hours starts at Perrys Lookdown and descends sharply to the valley floor. Crossing through a corner of the Blue Gum Forest, the track goes south through the Acacia Flat camp ground, following the Govetts Creek. Passing several abandoned campgrounds, the path forks at Junction Rock; the route to Govetts Leap was closed in October 2003, following a landslide, reopened in December 2007, and closed again since 2020. 

In the other direction, along Govetts Creek, the route then starts a continuous climb towards the Grand Canyon, where it forks again; a closed track goes to Neates Glen, while the other is a steep climb to Evans Lookout. The general direction of travel is towards the southeast and this direction is recommended as the final climb at Evans Lookout is in the shade in the afternoon. Creeks in the valley are seasonal, the water is unsafe to drink. The walk is much more strenuous in summer due to the higher daily temperatures and the added risk of bushfires.

The valley has been affected by bushfires at various times, notably in 1982, 2006, and 2020. In particular the Blue Gum Forest was damaged by back burning. Owing to the harsh bushfires in 2006 and 2020, the Blue Gum forest and other walking tracks in the valley were closed to bushwalkers to allow the regrowth of vegetation. Since 2020, Govetts Leap descent and Rodriguez Pass are semi-permanently closed due to landslides. The remaining access points to the valley include the Horse Track, Pierces Pass, Lockleys Pylon, Perrys Lookdown, and Victoria Falls.

==Conservation==
The Grose Valley arguably became the cradle of the modern conservation movement in NSW when Blue Gum Forest was saved from threatened destruction in 1931-32. A group from the Sydney Bush Walkers club, led by Alan Rigby, were camped in the forest when they chanced upon a Bilpin farmer, Clarrie Hungerford. Hungerford had a lease of the forest and told the bushwalkers he planned to clear the blue gums to plant walnuts. The bushwalkers went away and started a campaign to stop him. Eventually, they raised £130 which they paid Hungerford in exchange for his relinquishing the lease. It was a substantial amount at the height of the great depression. 80 pounds came in the form of an interest-free loan from James Cleary, then head of the NSW railways and subsequently chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Cleary was also a bushwalker.

One of the key activists in the campaign was Myles Dunphy, who at the time was developing his plans for the Blue Mountains National Park.

During the 1800s there were various proposals to dam the Grose Valley, and one such dam would have been at the forest. The area was also the subject of a number of proposed coal and shale mining ventures, and in the 1850s it was planned that the main western railway line would be routed up the Grose River and through the forest.

In 1875 Blue Gum Forest was the scene of an artists’ camp established by Eccleston Du Faur, of the Academy of Art. Several magnificent photographs by Joseph Philip Bischoff and drawings and paintings by William Piguenit resulted. Another outcome was that the whole Grose Valley and surrounds was reserved from alienation because it was ‘a national spectacle’. At the time there was no national park in Australia, and indeed Australia was not even a nation—but the reservation in essence was the country’s first national park.

<text>Albino Blacksheep (ABS) is an animation website based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It publishes member submitted digital media made with Adobe Flash. The website also features image galleries, audio files, and text files, and flash games along with a mobile section that provided ring tones, screensavers, and wallpaper for mobile phones.

==History==
Albino Blacksheep was proposed in 1995 by Steven Lerner, to promote his band of the same name, which was started in 1996. Very little information on the band Albino Blacksheep exists. In 2000, Steven took a web design course and redesigned the website. This new incarnation contained rants, graphical images, and a video stream from Lerner&#x27;s video camera.

Albino Blacksheep is also famous for being a major portal for Flash animation and animutation (a Flash animation style created by Neil Cicierega in 2001). The popular Web game &quot;Musical Lantern&quot; can be found on this site. The website also helped the band Tally Hall achieve some notability after posting their music video &quot;Banana Man&quot;.

<text>Ainu music is the musical tradition of the Ainu people of northern Japan. Ainu people have no indigenous system of writing, and so have traditionally inherited the folklore and the laws of their culture orally, often through music.

The oral Ainu culture includes various genres, including &quot;upopo&quot;
, lighthearted ballads on daily affairs and rituals often accompanied by traditional Ainu instrumentation, and &quot;yukar&quot; (mimicry), a form of rhythmic epic poetry often supported by light percussion.

The contents of these ballads were historically an important source of understanding daily life as well as various traditions and habits of the Ainu people, and remain today an important part of the Ainu cultural identity and inheritance, as seen in efforts by performers such as Oki, the most famous contemporary performer of Ainu music.

The most useful English-language overview of Ainu music (with recordings and transcriptions) is by Chiba Nobuhiko.

==Traditional Ainu music genres==
Ainu music carries spiritual resonance in almost all of its forms, and it has played an important role in both the cultural history and the cultural renaissance of the Ainu people. Almost every type of Ainu song is sacred, and even the musical instruments are said to be imbued with souls. Traditional Ainu music can be divided into two major groups – everyday songs and epic songs. Everyday songs in Ainu tradition were sung in many situations and on an impromptu basis. They were often accompanied by the two most prevalent Ainu musical instruments: the &quot;tonkori&quot;, a plucked zither, and the &quot;mukkuri&quot;, a jaw harp played by women.

=== Upopo ===
These everyday songs are short, fairly simple, and center on an activity like a game or work. The act of singing is itself used as a game in some instances, such as Rekuhkara (Ainu throat-singing) competitions between women. Work songs are rhythmic, with lyrics and melodies based on the work with which they are sung. However, even such everyday songs have sacred rather than mundane meanings. &quot;Chants like the &quot;kar upopo&quot; (sake-making song) and the &quot;iyuta upopo&quot; (the pounding song)…are not labor songs; rather, they are magic-oriented, for they are sung to ward off evil spirits&quot;. Short, everyday songs are also a way of praying. 
These prayer songs are (or were) performed regularly before meals, after a fishing trip, to ask for luck in hunting, and in many other contexts. Unfortunately, material about everyday songs is very difficult to obtain. Many have never been recorded.

=== Yukar ===

Ainu epic songs, &quot;yukar&quot;, are performed as long monologues. The singer performs the song entirely from memory, and, traditionally, in a &quot;non-formal&quot; setting such as a friend&#x27;s house or before the hearth at a gathering. While somewhat casual, these epics are still more formal than the short prayer songs mentioned earlier. Both men and women recite Ainu epics, though the vocal qualities of women are considered preferable to those of men. The epic songs are fairly rhythmic melodic chants. The voice of the singer usually fluctuates within words, and phrases and sentences are distinguished by the melody. Singers strive for their audience to understand every word. The epic is unaccompanied by musical instruments, though at times both the singer and the listener might tap &quot;repni&quot;, or simple blocks of wood, against the hearth or the floor to help keep time and punctuate the epic. Certain paintings also show these epics being performed lying down, with the singer beating time on his or her abdomen with the hands, but this practice has faded into obscurity.

Epics themselves take several different forms. Following Philippi&#x27;s model and dividing them in two different ways, they can be distinguished by both subject and style. Philippi divides epic subjects into two groups: mythic narratives and heroic narratives. Mythic narratives are those epics featuring origin stories and stories of deities, while heroic narratives are those narratives featuring the cultural heroes of the Ainu. Mythic narratives can be told either from the point of view of a human observer or from the point of view of the divine participant. One of the most distinctive aspects of Ainu epics is this first person god point of view. Heroic narratives feature one of several major culture heroes, or recurring protagonists of mythical origins, such as &quot;Kotan-Kor-Kamui&quot;, or the Owl God. Though these culture heroes are often presented as gods, they are more human than they seem. They are analogous to the Navajo and Apache Coyote; while he is a god, he is representative of human interests and foibles. Stylistically, epics can be divided into two more categories. Some epics are novelistic and feature a set chain of events involving gods and humans, while others, which Philippi refers to as parodies, feature abnormal situations – unexplained phenomena and dreams, presented without a clear chronological narrative. These &quot;parody&quot; epics are very rare.

Epics, as well as a few of the more everyday songs, are regularly featured in Ainu ceremonies. For example, the most famous of Ainu cultural events, the &quot;bear-sending ceremony,&quot; is accompanied by a whole host of songs, not the least of which is the &quot;Song of a Bear,&quot; a mythic epic. This epic relates the story of the bear god, who, in saving his young son, is killed by human hunters. The song both presents the situation from the god&#x27;s point of view – he is confused when he is killed, and doesn&#x27;t recognize his own dead body for what it is – and prescribes the methods for the bear-sending ceremony. The premise for the bear-sending is that the bear god is trapped in his mortal body, and by killing the bear in a ritualized, respectful manner, humans are doing the god a favor and sending him home. The song describes the &quot;inau&quot;, or carved sticks that are used as holy objects by the Ainu, as well as the prayers and ceremonies that are used to send the bear home. In this way, the ceremony and the epic are somewhat inseparable. The activities of the ceremony are outlined by the epic, and the epic accompanies the ceremony to reinforce it. Though the epic can be performed outside of the ceremony, it cannot exist without the ceremony as context, and the ceremony cannot be performed without the epic. These epics, as well as the everyday songs, represent the cultural heritage of the Ainu and allow us to understand customs and their mythic significance, but they also act as indicators of the relative well-being of the Ainu culture.

=== Rekuhkara ===

Rekukhara, also known as &quot;rekutkar&quot; (composed from the Ainu words for throat, rekut, and produce kar), was a vocal game popular amongst Sakhalin Ainu, and used throat singing techniques comparable to katajjaq, the Inuit singing style. A game was typically played by two to ten people at a time, always in pairs.

At the start of each game, players take opposite places and form with their hands a closed tube between each other&#x27;s mouths. One of the players starts by making a certain rhythmical motive which then resonates in the other player&#x27;s mouth. This player must then uphold this motive until the other player decides to change motive. Whoever can uphold these rules without losing breath or laughing wins.

According to an interview with the daughter of the last practitioner of this style (who died in 1973), the rekukhara was often done during the iomante ritual, the slaughter of a brown bear, as the produced sounds from this game would symbolically refer to the cries of the bear.

=== Yaisama ===
Yaisama is a form of singing game used as an expression of certain emotions (such as expressing love) or as means of self introduction in a group. As lyrics and melody are improvised on the spot, this genre can be compared to contemporary freestyle rap.

=== Lullabies ===
The name of these Ainu lullabies differ by location: the terms &quot;Iyon&#x27;nokka&quot; or &quot;Iyonruika&quot; were commonly used in the Hidaka region, while Ihunke was the term used by Asahikawa and Tokachi Ainu.

One of the characteristics of these lullabies, is the mother&#x27;s production of meaningless sounds such as &quot;Ohho Lulu Rurururu&quot; on the rhythm of lulling baby&#x27;s cradle, typically done by rolling the tip of the tongue.

== Instruments ==
The two most prevalent Ainu musical instruments are the tonkori and the mukkuri. Through the effort of Ainu cultural organizations as well as prominent musicians, both have enjoyed a certain revival. Evidence shows the existence of several other instruments attributed to the Ainu, but these are no longer in active use.

As a result of the geographical dispersion of the Ainu people over various neighboring islands, some of these native instruments strongly differ in usage and construction.

=== Mukkuri ===
The Mukkuri is an idiophone made out of bamboo, similar in construction to the Jew&#x27;s harp. Sound is produced by manipulating a string connected to the bamboo reed, and while the instrument is unpitched, tone manipulation can be accomplished by altering the size of one&#x27;s mouth, which serves as a resonance box during playing.

Historically this instrument did not retain a large importance in Ainu communities and was commonly seen as a children&#x27;s toy rather than a tool for supporting songs or rituals. The mukkuri&#x27;s inexpensive production however has made it a popular tourist souvenir in Hokkaido.

=== Tonkori ===

The tonkori, an onomatopoeic description of the sound the instrument produces, is a plucked string instrument and generally has five strings made out of gut. Unfretted and played open, the tonkori is limited in tones by the number of strings. 
The tonkori is played by both men and women and commonly serves as musical accompaniment to yukar or dances and rituals, although solo-performances have been noted as well.

=== Kakko ===
The kakko was a percussion instrument similar to the tambourine, used for accompanying yukar or shamanistic rituals. It was made by stretching animal skin over a cylindrical ring commonly made out of willow or larch, and its drumbeater was done by wrapping dogskin over a branch.

=== Cirektekuttar ===
The cirektekuttar (referred to in Sakhalin as &quot;henyudo&quot;, &quot;ionka&quot; or &quot;pehkutu&quot;), was a cylindrical wind instrument made out of the root of a reed indigenous to northern Japan, and is thought to have been similar in style and usage as the didgeridoo developed by Indigenous Australians.

=== Pararayki ===

After cultural exchange with the Russians, Ainu living on the Kurille islands built this instrument in the image of the Russian balalaika, pronounced in Ainu as pararayki.

=== Ainu fiddle ===

Missionary-anthropologist John Batchelor describes the existence of several Ainu-created fiddles no longer in use.

==Identity and marginalization==
Ainu music has been important throughout the years in both reflecting and establishing the Ainu cultural identity. Ainu music, historically, has represented the state of Ainu society. The folkloric epics of the Ainu often refer directly to the state of the Ainu as a group. For example, when the Ainu were first conquered, in the period of decline after the 16th century, the culture heroes featured in the heroic types of epics were said to have &quot;departed in indignation,&quot;. In addition to this kind of direct representation of Ainu cultural identity, the variable increase and decline of Ainu music is also indicative of Ainu culture. In the peak Ainu period, the most complex and fantastic epics were created, stretching out to tens of thousands of verses and building on new and complex ideas. In the most desperate period for the Ainu, however, in late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the population declined to only 15,000 or so, Ainu music was very scarce; even the famous bear-sending ceremony was described as a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; experience in 1948.

=== Decline ===
The pressure on Ainu music throughout their history as a people under the rule of a dominant majority has come largely from the Japanese government. The Japanese government deliberately banned Ainu language, music, and dance (including the bear ceremony) in 1799 in an attempt to homogenize the Ainu with the larger Japanese population. In addition to this, through pressure and in governmental institutions such as schools, &quot;on every possible occasion the Bakufu persuaded the natives to follow the Japanese way,&quot;. This attitude, that the Ainu should do as much as possible to become Japanese, existed in the government well into the 20th century. A railway tourism manual published in 1941 reflects not only this attitude, but also the idea that the Ainu were happy to have their culture suppressed in this way. &quot;They have a special aversion to distinctive treatment, and have Japanized themselves in every respect. They have abandoned their native customs and manners, forgotten the Ainu tongue and effected a complete change in their daily life.&quot; It continues, &quot;They requested of the Government a census whereby they might become recognized Japanese subjects. This the Government instituted and the Ainu were accepted as common people. Consequently, they are now so Japanesque that their characteristics as an Ainu race will vanish before long,&quot;. While these excerpts are indicative of the attitude of the government that the Ainu should conform to the rest of Japanese society, the pamphlet&#x27;s very existence counters the idea that they fit in. The pamphlet goes on to detail the very differences that make the Ainu worth writing a tourism pamphlet on, describing their customs and ceremonies and even pointing out their racial differences.
This kind of contradiction is actually characteristic of the way the Japanese government has treated the Ainu, especially in the early 20th century. Besides publications such as the aforementioned pamphlet, the government also created cultural shows featuring Ainu song and dance that acted as tourist attractions (this occurred, of course, after the ban on Ainu music had been lifted). Ainu singers and dancers could often only find an avenue for their talents, and in some cases, find any job at all, in these cultural shows. The shows featured sacred, ceremonial songs, especially those of the famous bear-sending. The songs would be repeated three or four times a day, for dozens of tourists. Kayano Shigeru, who some have called &quot;Ainu personified&quot;, a prominent Ainu public figure, recalls the shows he participated in with shame. &quot;It is beyond words for me to explain to others how miserable it made us feel to sing and dance – albeit for money – in front of curious tourists from throughout Japan when we weren&#x27;t even happy or excited.&quot; The government was, in effect, encouraging certain aspects of Ainu culture while concurrently suppressing it as a whole. Ceremonial songs and dances became both a viable means of making a living and a shameful badge of dishonor.

=== Revival ===
In recent years, Ainu music has begun to take part in an intense Ainu cultural revival. The Ainu began reclaiming their identity as a cultural group in the 1960s and 1970s, meeting with one another, creating organized groups, and even developing an Ainu flag. While most of this reclamation occurred by way of peaceful meetings and beneficial organizations such as Kayano Shigeru&#x27;s work for a national Ainu museum, some groups, like Ainu Liberation, used terrorist tactics such as the bombing of 23 October 1972, to attract attention to their cause. As a whole, however, the movement for Ainu cultural identity has been exacted through cultural media such as art, storytelling, and music, and political tactics like voting blocs and nonviolent protests. In the 1970s and 1980s, festival and ceremonial revivals began to occur, acting as a catalyst for cultural unity. When Ainu ceremonies were performed regularly for the first time in years, it allowed Ainu to come together, to identify and get to know one another through the avenue of culture, and to bond through that avenue as well. In addition to the creation of community in this way, and because Ainu song is so firmly rooted in history, Ainu were able to reclaim their folkloric history through these ceremonies.

The revival of Ainu culture, and especially music, has meant more than just the development of a cohesive group of Ainu people, however. It has, not surprisingly, also resulted in the rise of an Ainu-music pop star on the Japanese stage. Oki Kano, the most prominent player of Ainu-inspired pop music in Japan, plays songs that are based on Ainu ceremonial songs. They use indigenous Ainu instruments, Ainu language, and Ainu subject matter, but also include Western influences such as guitar and bass, and sound similar to British ska music. Oki Kano is fairly well known in Japan, and represents the idea of Ainu music to many Japanese people, even though his music is very Westernized.

<text>Franz Eckert (5 April 1852 – 6 August 1916) was a German composer and musician who composed the harmony for Japan&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; and the national anthem of the Korean Empire, &quot;Aegukga&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Eckert was a native of Neurode, Prussian Silesia (now Nowa Ruda, Poland), and the son of a court official. He studied in the conservatories of Breslau (Wrocław) and the Royal Conservatory in Dresden, and specialized in military music at Neiße. He received an appointment to become bandmaster to the Kaiserliche Marine at Wilhelmshaven, where he caught the attention of the Japanese government in 1879.

==Career==
Eckert was invited to the Empire of Japan as a foreign advisor at the behest of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Eckert served as director of the Navy Band from 1879 to 1880. At the time, the need for an anthem was especially pressing in the Navy, as Japanese officers were embarrassed by their inability to sing their own anthem at flag ceremonies at sea. The existing anthem had been created by John William Fenton in 1869. In 1880, the Imperial Household Agency adopted a modified melody attributed to Hiromori Hayashi. Although the melody is based on a traditional mode of Japanese court music, it is composed in a mixed style derived from Western hymns. Some elements of the Fenton arrangement are retained. Eckert rearranged the existing anthem per the Gregorian mode for Western instrumentation, making suitable modifications for playability at sea, including a four-part vocal arrangement. The new national anthem was first performed in the imperial palace on Emperor Meiji&#x27;s birthday, 3 November 1880.

Between 1883 and 1886 he worked in the Ministry of Education for the Music Examination Board in the area of wind and string music. However, his most important task was the publication of the books of songs for use in Japanese elementary schools. In March 1888, Eckert joined the Department of Classical Music of the Imperial Household Ministry, established the military band of the Imperial Guards, and founded the military band of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. He was active in composing ceremonial music for both the Court and for the military, while introducing a variety of Western musical instruments and musical theories on melody and harmony.

In 1897, he was invited to compose a special song, which he titled &quot;Kanashimi no kiwami&quot;, for the funeral of Empress Dowager Eishō (widow of Emperor Kōmei).

Eckert returned to Germany in 1899 due to ill health, and obtained a posting at the Berlin Philharmonic, but was soon appointed music director to Kaiser Wilhelm II. However, his stay in Germany was short, and soon after his health had improved, he accepted an invitation extended by the Korean Empire to build a court orchestra and to train musicians in European musical instruments and techniques.

Eckert arrived in Seoul on 19 February 1901. His duties in Korea were similar to those he had previously executed in Japan. He soon had a small court orchestra of two dozen musicians established, which he subsequently built up to 70 members. The orchestra performed regularly at the court, but played every Thursday in Pagoda Park for the general public and for the Seoul-based expatriate community, during which performances, Eckert took the opportunity to publicize his own compositions, as well as those of Richard Wagner. Eckert was soon called upon to supply the harmony for the national anthem of Korea, the &quot;Daehan jeguk Aegukga&quot; which premiered on 9 September 1902. On 20 December 1902, Eckert got 3rd Class of Order of the Taeguk. From 5 April 1902, Eckert was instructor of military band of 1st Siwi Regiment. The new anthem had elements from the works of Wagner, and was played before Emperor Gojong, who was himself a Prussian enthusiast. However, only a few years later, in 1910, Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan, and the anthem was banned in favor of Eckert&#x27;s earlier creation, the &quot;Kimigayo&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Eckert remained in Korea, but in much reduced circumstances due to loss of his royal patrons. His situation was complicated by renewed ill health, and the outbreak of World War I and, in 1916, he resigned as conductor of his orchestra in favor of his first flautist, whom he had trained as his successor. Eckert died in Seoul from stomach cancer at age 65. His grave is located at Yanghwajin, Hapjeong-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul. He was survived by his son Heinz Eckert.

<doc id="1117197" wikidata="Q257309" url="?curid=1117197" title="ISO 15022">
<text>ISO 15022 is an ISO standard for securities messaging used in transactions between financial institutions. Participants in the financial industry need a common representation of the financial transactions they perform and this standard defines general message schema, which in turn are used by organizations to define messages in a complete and unambiguous way. This results in efficiency, lower costs, and the avoidance of errors. Prior to standardization in this area, there were overlapping standards, or ad hoc approaches where there was a functional gap and no standard.

== Transition from ISO 7775 to ISO 15022 ==
ISO 15022 replaces the previous securities messaging standard ISO 7775. It provides two syntaxes: one compatible with the preceding standards, and one fairly compatible with EDIFACT. ISO 20022 is the successor to ISO 15022.

SWIFT is the registration authority for ISO 15022. In SWIFT financial messages, the standard is applied to variety of message types.

ISO 15022 was developed in 1992, in London, to provide the securities industry with a better tool to create message standards. The previous standard ISO 7775 contained the actual message standards themselves (like the SWIFT message types MT 520 or MT 534), which did not make it easy to make changes to these standards (because each time one needs to pass a number of time-consuming standard cycles). To avoid this, ISO 15022 does not contain the actual messages, but contains a set of rules and guidelines to build messages. If these rules and guidelines are adhered to (checked by the registration authority) the resulting message (format) is automatically an ISO 15022-compliant standard. Examples are the MT103, MT202 Cov, MT540, MT542, MT548, etc.

==Parts==
ISO 15022 is split into two parts:

*ISO 15022-1:1999 &quot;Securities -- Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) -- Part 1: Data field and message design rules and guidelines&quot; 
*ISO 15022-2:1999 &quot;Securities -- Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) -- Part 2: Maintenance of the Data Field Dictionary and Catalogue of Messages&quot;

<doc id="1117203" wikidata="Q323586" url="?curid=1117203" title="James McLamore">
<text>James Whitman McLamore (May 30, 1926 – August 8, 1996) was an American entrepreneur, the founder and first CEO of the Burger King fast food franchise, along with David Edgerton. He also created the Whopper sandwich. After selling Burger King to the Pillsbury Company in 1967, he remained CEO for five years. After retiring, he was on the board of several large corporations, was chairman of the University of Miami, chaired the United Way and was a member and chairman of the Orange Bowl Committee.

McLamore invested in the Miami Dolphins for several years and reinvested in the educational institutions that impacted him at Northfield Mount Hermon and Cornell University. He was also a gardener, and chairman at Fairchild Tropical Gardens.

==Early life and education==
McLamore was born in 1926, in New York City. After the stock market crash of 1929, Jim&#x27;s father moved the family to the country to live with Jim&#x27;s grandmother. Jim lost his mother soon after and his family struggled during that time. McLamore went to Northfield Mount Hermon School before attending Cornell University at the School of Hotel Management. He arrived at Cornell with only $11 in his pocket, but he graduated in 1947. During his time at Cornell, he served in the United States Navy and was a member of the New York Alpha chapter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Upon graduating from Cornell, Jim married Nancy Nichol of Miami, Florida.

==Careers==
His first job in the restaurant business was at a YMCA cafeteria in Wilmington, Delaware, before branching out to start his 24/7 fast service restaurant, the Colonial Inn in 1949. He started a third concept called McLamore&#x27;s Brickell Bridge Restaurant at 550 Brickell Avenue in Miami, Florida, in 1951.

Dave Edgerton, the first franchisee of Insta Burger King from Jacksonville, Florida, opened his first unit in Miami, on March 1, 1954. Edgerton had been eager for McLamore to join him in the business, but McLamore had to sell his other two restaurants first. Then, on June 1, he and Edgerton joined forces and formed Burger King of Miami, Inc. Together, they opened numerous Burger King stores and introduced the Whopper in 1957. Concurrently, Edgerton, exasperated by the unreliable Insta machines, developed the flame broiler, a key innovation that distinguished Burger King from its competitors.

In 1961, McLamore negotiated the national rights to Burger King dropping the Insta title and began growth across the country. McLamore and Edgerton created two supporting businesses in 1962, Distron and Davmor Industries. Distron became the food distribution center for all the stores. Davmor Industries was the manufacturing plant that produced and supplied all kitchen equipment, signage, tables, chairs, booths, for each new store.

Burger King was expanding, but as McDonald&#x27;s went public in 1965, organic growth became difficult in keeping up. The pair sold the 274 store business to Pillsbury in 1967 in an attempt to grow under the brand. McLamore served as Burger King&#x27;s CEO until 1972, when he stepped down as Pillsbury was taking the business in a different direction. He remained chairman of the company until 1976.

===Miami Dolphins===
After his early retirement, McLamore, with four other businessmen, invested in the Miami Dolphins in the early 1970s from Joe Robbie that led to their resurgence under Don Shula. In 1980, he was elected as Chairman of the University of Miami and worked with Tad Foote to fund raise the third largest campaign to date, resulting in $517.5 million raised for the university. He pursued his passion in gardening, both at home and with Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. After Hurricane Andrew destroyed much of Miami, he helped raise $5 million to rebuild the gardens.

In 1988, Grand Metropolitan bought Pillsbury in a hostile takeover. In the early 1990s, McLamore was asked by Jim Adamson, then CEO of Burger King, to come back to support the company with his advice and consulting, particularly with the Franchise community. He returned and gave speeches at the National Franchisee Association conference&#x27;s in San Francisco and Orlando.

During his re-engagement with Burger King, Jim authored his autobiography, titled &quot;The Burger King: Jim McLamore and The Building of an Empire,&quot; initially published posthumously by McGraw Hill in 1998. This work underwent subsequent editing and republishing in 2020 under the title &quot;The Burger King: A Whopper of a Story on Life and Leadership&quot; by the McLamore Family.

==Death==
McLamore died of lung cancer in Coral Gables, Florida, on August 8, 1996, at the age of 70.

==Appointments and leadership positions==

<text>Raymond Murray Schafer (18 July 1933 – 14 August 2021) was a Canadian composer, writer, music educator, and environmentalist perhaps best known for his World Soundscape Project, concern for acoustic ecology, and his book &quot;The Tuning of the World&quot; (1977). He was the first recipient of the Jules Léger Prize in 1978.

==Biography==
Born in Sarnia, Ontario, he studied at the Royal Schools of Music in London, the Royal Conservatory of Music (in Toronto), and the University of Toronto. At the last institution he was a pupil of Richard Johnston.

His music education theories are followed around the world. He started soundscape studies at Simon Fraser University in the 1960s.

In addition to popularizing the concept of soundscape (Schafer attributes the invention of the term to city planner Michael Southworth), he also coined the term &quot;schizophonia&quot; in 1969, the splitting of a sound from its source or the condition caused by this split: &quot;We have split the sound from the maker of the sound. Sounds have been torn from their natural sockets and given an amplified and independent existence. Vocal sound, for instance, is no longer tied to a hole in the head but is free to issue from anywhere in the landscape.&quot; Steven Feld, borrowing a term from Gregory Bateson, calls the recombination and recontextualization of sounds split from their sources &quot;schismogenesis&quot;.

In 1987 Schafer was awarded the first Glenn Gould Prize in recognition of his contributions. He also won two JUNO Awards for Classical Composition of the Year: in 2004 for his &quot;String Quartet No. 8&quot;, and in 2011 for his &quot;Duo for Violin and Piano&quot;.

In 2003 Schafer was the artistic director of Coimbra Vibra!, an event that celebrated music and the acoustic environment, gathering 1200 musicians and over 10000 spectators in the city of Coimbra (Portugal).
In 2005 Schafer was keynote speaker at the 12th International Congress on Sound and Vibration. His presentation was titled &quot;I have never seen a sound.&quot; In 2005 Schafer was awarded the Walter Carsen Prize, by the Canada Council for the Arts, one of the top honours for lifetime achievement by a Canadian artist. In 2009, Schafer received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts. In 2013, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions as an internationally renowned composer of contemporary music, and for his groundbreaking work in acoustic ecology&quot;.

Schafer was a practitioner of graphic notation. He died at his home near Peterborough, Ontario, of complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on 14 August 2021.

Starting in 2010 a World Listening Day organised by the World Listening Project has taken place annually on 18 July, with the date chosen in honour of Schafer&#x27;s birthday.

<text>Capital Hill (postcode: 2600) is the location of Parliament House, Canberra, at the south apex of the land axis of the Parliamentary Triangle.

The site was selected as the location of the &quot;Capitol&quot; in Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s Canberra design in 1912, which he envisaged to be &quot;either a general administration structure for popular receptions and ceremony or for housing archives and commemorating Australian Achievements&quot;. The proposed building is commemorated in the name of the &quot;Capitol Theatre&quot;, Manuka. However, Griffin&#x27;s name for the hill was subsequently changed to Capital Hill.

The Parliament buildings were to be located a little further down the hill towards Lake Burley Griffin at Camp Hill, between Capital Hill and the Provisional Parliament House. Griffin opposed the plan to build a Provisional Parliament House on the lower slopes of Camp Hill, because he considered that it would make it difficult to build the permanent Parliament House on Camp Hill, as the provisional building would have to be demolished.

In fact, in the 1958 and 1964 Holford plans for the Parliamentary Triangle, the site for the New Parliament House was moved to the lake shore, partly for this reason. Holford also reportedly said that a lakeside site would discourage politicians from seeing themselves as superior to ordinary people.

However, in 1974 Parliament voted to move the Parliament to its permanent location on Capital Hill, which it saw as befitting the eminence of the institution. Construction of the new parliament buildings commenced in 1981 and the new building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1988, when the Parliament relocated from the old building.

Capital Hill was previously named Kurrajong Hill and is around 2.5 km2, surrounded by a circular road (Capital Circle). Until the construction of the current Parliament House, the hill was covered with scrubby native bushland. The construction of the current parliament building required removing much of the top half of the hill, and after construction, much of the earth was replaced on top of the building. The surrounding hill is landscaped with native plants, while the soil on top of Parliament House is planted with lawn. However, on the western side of the Hill, a small area of the original native bushland has been preserved.

The streets that go out from Capital Hill are named after Australian capitals, and some of their direction roughly corresponds to the direction of that capital city, Melbourne Avenue, Adelaide Avenue, Perth Avenue, Hobart Avenue and Darwin Avenue with Brisbane Avenue, Sydney Avenue not even being close. The streets which surround the hill in concentric circles are named after increasing spheres of influence with the inner-most circle called Parliament drive and then spanning out to Capital Circle, State Circle, National Circuit, Dominion Circuit and Empire Circuit.
When Griffin drew up his plans in 1912, there was still some optimism that New Zealand might join the Federation of Australia. Griffin&#x27;s plans included eight avenues radiating out from Capital Hill named after the capitals of the six states, the capital of the Northern Territory and the capital of New Zealand.

Before the name Wellington Avenue was gazetted, it was realised that New Zealand was not going to become part of a Confederation of Australasia and the name was replaced by Canberra Avenue. Griffin planned that the state capital city avenues were terminated with a park named after the generic botanical name for a native plant from that particular site; for example, Telopea Park is named after the waratah, the floral emblem of New South Wales, and is at the end of Sydney Avenue, named after the capital of New South Wales.

The name of the precinct of Manuka is a remnant of Griffin&#x27;s naming scheme. Another remnant of Griffin&#x27;s nomenclature was the &quot;Wellington Hotel&quot;, formerly on the corner of Canberra Avenue and National Circuit, which was demolished and replaced by the hotel known as of 2007 as &quot;Rydges Capital Hill Canberra&quot;.

==Geology==

The geology of Capital Hill has been studied in great detail. Canberra Formation, calcareous Shale is found in the south west and north east. This overlies middle Silurian Camp Hill Sandstone. The sandstone unconformably overlies the early Silurian Black Mountain Sandstone and State Circle Shale. State Circle Shale is Late Llandovery in a more finely divided time scale and has been dated to 445.7 million years old. The State Circle Shale is composed of laminated shales and siltstone. Black Mountain Sandstone is composed of a white quartz sandstone. The Deakin Fault cuts the south west of state circle. Mount Painter acid volcanoes are to the south west of this fault.

<doc id="1117225" wikidata="Q2251989" url="?curid=1117225" title="Dance of the Hours">
<text>Dance of the Hours (Italian: &quot;&quot;) is a short ballet and is the act 3 finale of the opera &quot;La Gioconda&quot; composed by Amilcare Ponchielli. It depicts the hours of the day through solo and ensemble dances. The opera was first performed in 1876 and was revised in 1880. Later performed on its own, the &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; was at one time one of the best known and most frequently performed ballets. It became even more widely known after its inclusion in the 1940 Walt Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot; where it is depicted as a comic ballet featuring ostriches, hippopotamuses, elephants and alligators.

==Description==
The ballet, accompanied by an orchestra, appears at the end of the third act of the opera, in which the character Alvise, who heads the Inquisition, receives his guests in a large and elegant ballroom adjoining the death chamber. The music and choreography represent the hours of dawn, day (morning), twilight and night. Costume changes and lighting effects reinforce the progression. The dance is intended to symbolize the eternal struggle between the forces of light and darkness. It is about 10 minutes long.

==Structure==
The piece begins with an introduction in G major, with vocal assistance in the form of a recitative which is omitted in the symphonic version. Then follows in sequence: the dance of the hours of dawn, the hours of day, the hours of the night and the morning.

The episode devoted to dawn (in E major) merges with the extensive introduction to the episode dedicated to daytime hours, anticipating the rhythmic structure of four notes, which characterizes the episode. The transition point between the two episodes, where it marks the birth of the day, coincides with the intervention in fortissimo of the chorus (&quot;&quot;), which follows a slow chromatic passage, typical of Ponchielli&#x27;s style.

After a brief episode in C minor devoted to the night, based on figuration in staccato, a connected and expressive melody in E minor, played by cellos, introduces the morning. A new pathetic melody in A minor extends to a broad phrase with initial tone in E minor.

A brief diminuendo precedes the &quot;attacca&quot; of the final coda in A major, a vigorous can-can in the manner of Romualdo Marenco&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1881), introduced by an abrupt change of tempo to &quot;allegro vivacissimo&quot;.

==Derivative works==

*The tune is remembered by the character Leopold Bloom in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922).
*&quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; is one of the most frequently parodied pieces of classical music. An extract was first used by the Walt Disney Animation Studios in one of their earliest cartoon series (&quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;). The ballet was used in full in the Walt Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), albeit with ballet-dancing hippos (complete with tutus), ostriches, alligators and elephants including Madame Upanova, Hyacinth Hippo, Elephanchine, and Ben Ali Gator.
*It was the source of the tune for the song &quot;Like I Do&quot;, which was a hit in 1962 for Nancy Sinatra in Italy and Japan, Maureen Evans in the UK and Ireland, and Teresa Brewer in 1963 (as &quot;She&#x27;ll Never Love You (Like I Do)&quot;) in the USA.
* An excerpt of &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; plays at the very end of the &quot;Friends&quot; episode “The One Where Ross Finds Out”. 
*&quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; can be heard during the Slamacow&#x27;s &quot;Minecraft&quot; animation &quot;Silly Endertainment&quot;.
*Segments of the piece formed the basis for the Andrews Sisters song &quot;Idle Chatter&quot; (1952) written by Al Sherman.
*The melody of &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; was used by Allan Sherman in his biggest hit &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)&quot; (1963), and its sequel &quot;Return to Camp Granada&quot; (1965). This ballad also mentions James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which references the same melody.
*Choreographer Christopher Wheeldon created a new rendition of &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; for his ballet company, Morphoses. The work was featured in the company&#x27;s New York debut, in 2006 at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York.

<text>The Matiri River is a river located in the northwest of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The river is in the Tasman Region.

It runs south for 30 kilometres from its headwaters west of Mount Owen in Kahurangi National Park to its confluence with the Buller River just below the town of Murchison. Halfway along its length, it passes through Lake Matiri. Downstream from Lake Matiri the banks of the river has mixed livestock farming and some small scale forestry. Downstream from Lake Matiri, the Matiri River East Branch and the Matiri River West Branch flow into the Matiri River.

==Recreation==
The river is used for whitewater recreation. It has a tight grade III rapid in a narrow cleft of a gorge a short distance upstream of the road end. There are also two bouldery drops that can only be run in high flows when it may reach grade IV. The river is considered to be best run when the Buller River is too high and dangerous.

A tramping track that starts at the road end runs along the western side of the river.

==Hydroelectricity==
New Zealand Energy Limited have proposed the Matiri Project hydroelectric power scheme on the river.

<text>An origination fee or establishment fee is a payment charged for establishing a loan account with a bank, broker, or other financial service provider.

While origination fees can be a set amount, a tiered amount, or a percentage. Percentages typically range from 1.0% to 5.0% of the loan amount, varying based on whether the loan is in the prime or subprime market. For example, an origination fee of 5% on a $10,000 loan is $500.
In the United States, Discount points are used to buy down the interest rates, temporarily or permanently. Origination fees and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement. Regulation Z was enacted to protect borrowers from abusive lending practices. Under this regulation, origination fees for mortgages cannot be deducted from taxes.

<doc id="1117235" wikidata="Q1476003" url="?curid=1117235" title="My Sweet Lord">
<text>&quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; is a song by the English musician George Harrison, released in November 1970 on his triple album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. It was also released as a single, Harrison&#x27;s first as a solo artist, and topped charts worldwide; it was the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the UK. In America and Britain, the song was the first number-one single by an ex-Beatle. Harrison originally gave the song to his fellow Apple Records artist Billy Preston to record; this version, which Harrison co-produced, appeared on Preston&#x27;s &quot;Encouraging Words&quot; album in September 1970.

Harrison wrote &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; in praise of the Hindu god Krishna, while intending the lyrics as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his blending of the Hebrew word &quot;hallelujah&quot; with chants of &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; and Vedic prayer. The recording features producer Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound treatment and heralded the arrival of Harrison&#x27;s slide guitar technique, which one biographer described as &quot;musically as distinctive a signature as the mark of Zorro&quot;. Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Gary Brooker, Bobby Whitlock and members of the group Badfinger are among the other musicians on the recording.

Later in the 1970s, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was at the centre of a heavily publicised copyright infringement suit due to its alleged similarity to the Ronnie Mack song &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, a 1963 hit for the New York girl group the Chiffons. In 1976, Harrison was found to have subconsciously plagiarised the song, a verdict that had repercussions throughout the music industry. Rather than the Chiffons song, he said he used the out-of-copyright Christian hymn &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot; as his inspiration for the melody.

Harrison performed &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, and it remains the most popular composition from his post-Beatles career. He reworked it as &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000)&quot; for inclusion as a bonus track on the 30th-anniversary reissue of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. Many artists have covered the song, most notably Edwin Starr, Johnny Mathis and Nina Simone. &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was ranked 454th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2004 and 460th in the 2010 update and number 270 on a similar list published by the &quot;NME&quot; in 2014. It reached number one in Britain again when re-released in January 2002, two months after Harrison&#x27;s death.

==Background and inspiration==
George Harrison began writing &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; in December 1969, when he, Billy Preston and Eric Clapton were in Copenhagen, Denmark, as guest artists on Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s European tour. By this time, Harrison had already written the gospel-influenced &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot; and, with Preston, the African-American spiritual &quot;Sing One for the Lord&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple/EncouragingWords&quot;&gt;Andy Davis, Billy Preston &quot;Encouraging Words&quot; CD, liner notes (Apple Records, 2010; produced by George Harrison &amp; Billy Preston).&lt;/ref&gt; He had also produced two religious-themed hit singles on the Beatles&#x27; Apple record label: Preston&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot; and Radha Krishna Temple (London)&#x27;s &quot;Hare Krishna Mantra&quot;. The latter was a musical adaptation of the 5,000-year-old Vaishnava Hindu mantra, performed by members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), colloquially known as &quot;the Hare Krishna movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple/RKT&quot;&gt;Andy Davis, &quot;The Radha Krsna Temple&quot; CD, liner notes (Apple Records, 2010; produced by George Harrison; reissue produced by Andy Davis &amp; Mike Heatley).&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison wanted to fuse the messages of the Christian and Gaudiya Vaishnava faiths into what musical biographer Simon Leng terms &quot;gospel incantation with a Vedic chant&quot;.

The Copenhagen stopover marked the end of the Delaney &amp; Bonnie tour, with a three-night residency at the Falkoner Theatre on 10–12 December. According to Harrison&#x27;s 1976 court testimony, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was conceived while the band members were attending a backstage press conference and he had ducked out to an upstairs room at the theatre. Harrison recalled vamping chords on guitar and alternating between sung phrases of &quot;hallelujah&quot; and &quot;Hare Krishna&quot;. He later took the idea to the others, and the chorus vocals were developed further.

Band leader Delaney Bramlett&#x27;s later version of events is that the idea originated from Harrison asking him how to go about writing a genuine gospel song, and that Bramlett demonstrated by scat singing the words &quot;Oh my Lord&quot; while wife Bonnie and singer Rita Coolidge added gospel &quot;hallelujah&quot;s in reply. Music journalist John Harris has questioned the accuracy of Bramlett&#x27;s account, however, comparing it to a fisherman&#x27;s &quot;It was this big&quot;–type bragging story. Preston recalled that &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; came about through Harrison asking him about writing gospel songs during the tour. Preston said he played some chords on a backstage piano and the Bramletts began singing &quot;Oh my Lord&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. According to Preston: &quot;George took it from there and wrote the verses. It was very impromptu. We never thought it would be a hit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;Lois Wilson, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, &quot;Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution (The Beatles&#x27; Final Years – Jan 1, 1968 to Sept 27, 1970)&quot;, Emap (London, 2003), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using as his inspiration the Edwin Hawkins Singers&#x27; rendition of an eighteenth-century Christian hymn, &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;, Harrison continued working on the theme. He completed the song, with help from Preston, once they had returned to London.

==Composition==
The lyrics of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; reflect Harrison&#x27;s often-stated desire for a direct relationship with God, expressed in simple words that all believers could affirm, regardless of their religion. He later attributed the song&#x27;s message to Swami Vivekananda, particularly the latter&#x27;s teaching: &quot;If there&#x27;s a God, we must see him. And if there is a soul, we must perceive it.&quot; Author Ian Inglis observes a degree of &quot;understandable&quot; impatience in the first verse&#x27;s line &quot;Really want to see you, Lord, but it takes so long, my Lord&quot;. By the end of the song&#x27;s second verse, Harrison declares a wish to &quot;know&quot; God also and attempts to reconcile the impatience.
Following this verse, in response to the main vocal&#x27;s repetition of the song title, Harrison devised a choral line singing the Hebrew word of praise, &quot;hallelujah&quot;, common in the Christian and Jewish religions. Later in the song, after an instrumental break, these voices return, now chanting the first twelve words of the Hare Krishna mantra, known more reverentially as the Maha mantra:
These Sanskrit words are the main mantra of the Hare Krishna faith, with which Harrison identified, although he did not belong to any spiritual organisation. In his 1980 autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, Harrison says that he intended repeating and alternating &quot;hallelujah&quot; and &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; to show that the two terms meant &quot;quite the same thing&quot;, as well as to have listeners chanting the mantra &quot;before they knew what was going on!&quot;

Following the Sanskrit lines, &quot;hallelujah&quot; is sung twice more before the mantra repeats, along with an ancient Vedic prayer. According to Hindu tradition, this prayer is dedicated to a devotee&#x27;s spiritual teacher, or guru, and equates the teacher to the divine Trimurti – Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (or Maheshvara) – and to the Godhead, Brahman.
Religious academic Joshua Greene, one of the Radha Krishna Temple devotees in 1970, translates the lines as follows: &quot;I offer homage to my guru, who is as great as the creator Brahma, the maintainer Vishnu, the destroyer Shiva, and who is the very energy of God.&quot; The prayer is the third verse of the Guru Stotram, a fourteen-verse hymn in praise of Hindu spiritual teachers.

Several commentators cite the mantra and the simplicity of Harrison&#x27;s lyrics as central to the song&#x27;s universality. In Inglis&#x27;s view, &quot;[The] lyrics are not directed at a specific manifestation of a single faith&#x27;s deity, but rather to the concept of one god whose essential nature is unaffected by particular interpretations and who pervades everything, is present everywhere, is all-knowing and all-powerful, and transcends time and space ... All of us – Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jew, Buddhist – can address our gods in the same way, using the same phrase [&#x27;my sweet Lord&#x27;].&quot;

==Billy Preston&#x27;s version==
With the Beatles still together officially in December 1969, Harrison had no plans to make a solo album of his own and reportedly intended to offer &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; to Edwin Hawkins. Instead, following the Delaney &amp; Bonnie tour, he decided to record it with Billy Preston, for whom Harrison was co-producing a second Apple album, &quot;Encouraging Words&quot;. Recording took place at Olympic Studios in London, in January 1970, with Preston as principal musician, supported by the guitarist, bass player and drummer from the Temptations&#x27; backing band. The Edwin Hawkins Singers happened to be on tour in the UK as well, so Harrison invited them to participate.

Preston&#x27;s version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; differs from Harrison&#x27;s later reading in that the &quot;hallelujah&quot; refrain appears from the start of the song and, rather than the full mantra section, the words &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; are sung only twice throughout the whole track. With the Vedic prayer also absent, Leng views this original recording as a possible &quot;definitive &#x27;roots&#x27; take of the song, citing its &quot;pure gospel groove&quot; and Hawkins&#x27; participation. In his review of &quot;Encouraging Words&quot;, Bruce Eder of AllMusic describes &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (another Harrison composition originally given to Preston to record) as &quot;stunning gospel numbers ... that make the Harrison versions seem pallid&quot;.

Preston&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was a minor hit in Europe when issued as a single there in September 1970, but otherwise, &quot;Encouraging Words&quot; made little impression commercially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eder/AM&quot;&gt;Bruce Eder, &quot;Billy Preston &quot;Encouraging Words&quot;&quot;, AllMusic (retrieved 13 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The album and single releases were delayed for at least two months in the United States. There, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; climbed to number 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 by the end of February 1971, helped by the enormous success of Harrison&#x27;s version. Preston&#x27;s single also peaked at number 23 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Best Selling Soul Singles chart. In March 1971, he recorded a live version with King Curtis that was released in 2006 on the expanded edition of Curtis&#x27;s album &quot;Live at Fillmore West&quot;.

==Recording==
===Basic track===
Five months after the Olympic session, with the Beatles having broken up in April 1970, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was one of 30 or more tracks that Harrison recorded for his &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; triple album. He was initially reluctant to record the song, for fear of committing himself to such an overt religious message. In &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, he states: &quot;I was sticking my neck out on the chopping block because now I would have to live up to something, but at the same time I thought &#x27;Nobody&#x27;s &quot;saying&quot; it; I wish somebody else was doing it.
Principal recording took place at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London, with Phil Spector co-producing the sessions. Phil McDonald was the recording engineer for the basic track. It was taped on 28 May, the first day of formal recording for &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, after &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;. Having assembled a large cast of backing musicians for the sessions, Harrison initially recorded five takes of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; with just acoustic guitars and harmonium before changing to a full band arrangement.

The line-up of musicians on the song has been hard to ascertain due to the lack of available studio documentation and conflicting recollections over the ensuing decades. The musicians were requested by Harrison and booked by former Beatles roadie Mal Evans, acting in a role that Beatles scholar Kenneth Womack likens to a stage manager for the project. According to Womack and his co-author Jason Kruppa, Evans&#x27; diaries from the period provide the first reliable record of the participants at the &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; sessions, since Evans paid the musicians and had to justify this expenditure to Apple.

Harrison said that the musicians included &quot;about five&quot; acoustic guitarists, Ringo Starr and Jim Gordon on drums, two piano players and a bassist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/ClassicRock&quot;&gt;John Harris, &quot;How George Harrison Made the Greatest Beatles Solo Album of Them All&quot;, &quot;Classic Rock&quot;/loudersound.com, 27 November 2016 (retrieved 1 November 2020).&lt;/ref&gt; Evans&#x27; diary entry for 28 May lists the players on &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; as Harrison, Eric Clapton and Badfinger guitarists Pete Ham and Joey Molland, all on acoustic guitars; Gary Brooker on piano; Bobby Whitlock on harmonium; Klaus Voormann on bass; Starr on drums; and Alan White on tambourine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kruppa/MSL personnel&quot;&gt;Kruppa, event occurs at 19:37–20:05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison recalled working hard with the other acoustic guitarists &quot;to get them all to play exactly the same rhythm so it just sounded perfectly in sync&quot;. To achieve the resonant guitar sound on this and other &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; tracks, Molland said that he and his bandmates were partitioned off inside a plywood structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simons/AcousticGuitar&quot;&gt;David Simons, &quot;The Unsung Beatle: George Harrison&#x27;s behind-the-scenes contributions to the world&#x27;s greatest band&quot;, &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot;, February 2003, p. 60 (archived version retrieved 6 May 2021).&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald put what he terms a &quot;half soundproof box&quot; around Harrison, to help capture his acoustic guitar.

===Overdubs===

Take 16 of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was selected for overdubs. From late July onwards, Harrison and Peter Frampton added further acoustic guitars to the song and to other tracks from the album. The chorus vocals were all sung by Harrison and credited to &quot;the George O&#x27;Hara-Smith Singers&quot;. These contributions, together with Harrison&#x27;s slide guitar parts and Barham&#x27;s orchestral arrangement, were overdubbed during the next two months, partly at Trident Studios in central London with engineer Ken Scott.

Harrison experimented with several harmony ideas in his guitar parts, having first applied himself to mastering slide during the 1969 Delaney &amp; Bonnie tour. Scott had to extend the original track, repeating a portion of the final section, to allow for the closing prayer and fadeout. The session for Barham&#x27;s string arrangement took place on 18 September, involving 22 orchestral musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kruppa/MSL strings&quot;&gt;Kruppa, event occurs at 31:15–31:30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrangement===
Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes the completed recording as a &quot;painstakingly crafted tableau&quot; of sound, beginning with a bank of &quot;chiming&quot; acoustic guitars and the &quot;flourish&quot; of zither strings that introduces Harrison&#x27;s slide-guitar motif. At close to the two-minute mark, after the tension-building bridge, a subtle two-semitone shift in key (from E major to the rarely used key of F major, via a C dominant seventh chord) signals the song&#x27;s release from its extended introduction. This higher register is then complemented by Harrison&#x27;s &quot;increasingly impassioned&quot; vocal, according to Inglis, and the subsequent &quot;timely reappearance&quot; of his twin slide guitars, before the backing vocals switch to the Sanskrit mantra and prayer. Leng comments on the Indian music aspects of the arrangement, in the &quot;swarmandal-like&quot; zithers, representing the sympathetic strings of a sitar, and the slide guitars&#x27; evocation of sarangi, dilruba and other string instruments. In an interview for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2011 documentary &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot;, Spector recalls that he liked the results so much, he insisted that &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; be the lead single from the album.

This rock version of the song was markedly different from the &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;-inspired gospel arrangement in musical and structural terms, aligning Harrison&#x27;s composition with pop music conventions, but also drawing out the similarities of its melody line with that of the Chiffons&#x27; 1963 hit &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;. Beatles historian Bruce Spizer writes that this was due to Harrison being &quot;so focused on the feel of his record&quot;, while &quot;Record Collector&quot; editor Peter Doggett wrote in 2001 that, despite Harrison&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; having come from &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;, &quot;in the hands of producer and arranger Phil Spector, it came out as a carbon copy of the Chiffons&#x27; [song]&quot;. Chip Madinger and Mark Easter rue that Spector, as &quot;master of all that was &#x27;girl-group&#x27; during the early &#x27;60s&quot;, failed to recognise the similarities.

==Release==
Before arriving in New York on 28 October to carry out mastering on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Harrison had announced that no single would be issued – so as not to &quot;detract from the impact&quot; of the album. Apple&#x27;s US executive, Allan Steckler, surprised him by insisting that not only should Harrison abandon thoughts of paring down his new material into a single LP, but there were three sure-fire hit singles: &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot;. Spector said that he had to &quot;fight&quot; Harrison and the latter&#x27;s manager, Allen Klein, to ensure that &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was issued as the single. Film director Howard Worth recalls a preliminary finance meeting for the &quot;Raga&quot; documentary (for which Harrison would provide emergency funding through Apple Films) that began with the ex-Beatle asking him to listen to a selection of songs and pick his favourite, which was &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;. The song was selected even though Preston&#x27;s version was already scheduled for release as a single in America the following month.

Harrison was opposed to the release, but relented to Apple&#x27;s wishes. &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was issued as the album&#x27;s lead single around the world, but not in Britain; the release date was 23 November 1970 in the United States. The mix of the song differed from that found on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; by featuring less echo and a slightly altered backing-vocal track. Both sides of the North American picture sleeve consisted of a Barry Feinstein photo of Harrison taken through a window at his recently purchased Friar Park home, with some of the estate&#x27;s trees reflected in the glass. Released as a double A-side with &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;, with Apple catalogue number 2995 in America, both sides of the disc featured a full Apple label.

Public demand via constant airplay in Britain led to a belated UK release, on 15 January 1971. There, as Apple R 5884, the single was backed by &quot;What Is Life&quot;, a song that Apple soon released elsewhere internationally as the follow-up to &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;.

==Impact and commercial performance==

Harrison&#x27;s version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was an international number 1 hit by the end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971. It was the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single&#x27;s commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song &quot;rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan&#x27;s &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27; had arrived in the mid-sixties&quot;. Elton John recalled first hearing &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; in a taxi and named it as the last of the era&#x27;s great singles: &quot;I thought, &#x27;Oh my God,&#x27; and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it&#x27;s great, and you think, &#x27;Oh, what is this, what is this, what is this?&#x27; The only other record I ever felt that way about [afterwards] was &#x27;Brown Sugar&#x27; ...&quot;

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2002, Mikal Gilmore said &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was &quot;as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced&quot;. The release coincided with a period when religion and spirituality had become a craze among Western youth, as songs by Radha Krishna Temple and adaptations of the Christian hymns &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; were all worldwide hits, even as church attendance continued to decline. Harrison&#x27;s song popularised the Hare Krishna mantra internationally, further to the impact of the Radha Krishna Temple&#x27;s 1969 recording. In response to the heavy radio play, letters poured into the London temple from around the world, thanking Harrison for his religious message in &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;. According to music historian Andrew Grant Jackson, the single&#x27;s impact surpassed that of any other song in the era&#x27;s spiritual revival, and Harrison&#x27;s Indian-influenced slide playing, soon heard also in recordings by Lennon, Starr and Badfinger, was one of the most distinctive sounds of the early 1970s.

The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 14 December 1970 for sales of over 1 million copies. It reached number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 26 December, remaining on top for four weeks, three of which coincided with &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;″s seven-week run atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart. While &quot;Billboard&quot; recognised both sides of the single in the US, only &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; was listed when the record topped Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; 100 chart.

In Britain, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; entered the charts at number 7, before hitting number 1 on 30 January and staying there for five weeks. It was the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the UK and performed similarly well around the world, particularly in France and Germany, where it held the top spot for nine and ten weeks, respectively. In his 2001 appraisal of Harrison&#x27;s Apple recordings, for &quot;Record Collector&quot;, Doggett described Harrison as &quot;arguably the most successful rock star on the planet&quot; over this period, adding: My Sweet Lord&#x27; and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; topped charts all over the world, easily outstripping other solo Beatles projects later in the year, such as &quot;Ram&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot;.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Doggett/RecColl p 37&quot;&gt;Doggett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The single&#x27;s worldwide sales amounted to 5 million copies by 1978, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. By 2010, according to Inglis, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; had sold over 10 million copies. The song returned to the number 1 position again in the UK when reissued in January 2002, two months after Harrison&#x27;s death from cancer at the age of 58.

==Contemporary critical reception==
Reviewing the single for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jon Landau called the track &quot;sensational&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s reviewer described the record as &quot;a powerhouse two-sided winner&quot;, saying that &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; had the &quot;potent feel and flavor of another &#x27;Oh Happy Day, with powerful lyrics and an &quot;infectious rhythm&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;a haunting inspirational hare krishna chant-song to a tune reminiscent of the Chiffons&#x27; &#x27;He&#x27;s So Fine.&#x27;&quot; Ben Gerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that the substituting of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; refrain for the trivial &quot;Doo-lang, doo-lang, doo-lang&quot;s of &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; was &quot;a sign of the times&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerson/RS&quot;&gt;Ben Gerson, &quot;George Harrison &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;&quot; , &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, 21 January 1971, p. 46 (retrieved 30 March 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and recognised Harrison as &quot;perhaps the premier studio musician among rock band guitarists&quot;. In his December 1970 album review for &quot;NME&quot;, Alan Smith bemoaned the apparent lack of a UK single release for &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;. Smith said the song &quot;seems to owe something&quot; to &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith/NME&quot;&gt;Alan Smith, &quot;George Harrison: &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (Apple)&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 30 March 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerson called it an &quot;obvious re-write&quot;.

Led by the single, the album encouraged widespread recognition of Harrison as a solo artist and revised views of the nature of the Beatles&#x27; creative leadership. Among these writers, Don Heckman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; predicted that &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; / &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; would soon top the US charts and credited Harrison with having &quot;generated some of the major changes in the style and substance of the Beatles&quot; through his championing of Indian music and Eastern religion.

In a January 1971 review for &quot;NME&quot;, Derek Johnson expressed surprise at Apple&#x27;s delay in releasing the single in the UK, and stated: &quot;In my opinion, this record – finally and irrevocably – establishes George as a talent equivalent to either Lennon or McCartney.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore/NMEOrig&quot;&gt;Hunt, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; David Hughes of &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; said he had run out of superlatives to describe the two sides. He deemed &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; &quot;the most instant and the most commercial&quot; track on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, adding that the single release was long overdue and a solution for those put off by the high price of the triple LP. Hughes also wrote: &quot;A great rhythm is set up and then comes that superb steel guitar with which he&#x27;s so fallen in love... [The track] does sound like the old Chiffons&#x27; song &#x27;He&#x27;s So Fine&#x27;, but that&#x27;s not a knock, just a cocky observation.&quot;

At the end of 1971, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; topped the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reader&#x27;s polls for both &quot;Single of the Year&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Single of the Year&quot;. It was also voted &quot;Single of the Year&quot; in a poll conducted by Radio Luxembourg. In the US publication &quot;Record World&quot;, the song was voted best single and Harrison was named as &quot;Top Male Vocalist of 1971&quot;. In June 1972, Harrison won two Ivor Novello songwriter&#x27;s awards for &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;.

==Copyright infringement suit==
===Initial action===
On 10 February 1971, Bright Tunes Music Corporation filed suit against Harrison and associated organisations (including Harrisongs, Apple Records and BMI), alleging copyright infringement of the late Ronnie Mack&#x27;s song &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;. In &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, Harrison admits to having thought &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I realise?&quot; when others started pointing out the similarity between the two songs. By June that year, country singer Jody Miller had released a cover of &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; incorporating Harrison&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; slide-guitar riffs, thereby &quot;really putting the screws in&quot; from Harrison&#x27;s point of view. At this time, Bright Tunes were themselves the subject of litigation, as Mack&#x27;s mother had sued the company over non-payment of royalties. Allen Klein entered into negotiations with Bright Tunes, offering to buy its entire catalogue, but no settlement could be reached before the company was forced into receivership.

Musicologist Dominic Pedler writes that both songs have a three-syllable title refrain followed by a 5-3-2 descent of the major scale in the tonic key (E major for &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and G major for &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;); respective tempos are similar: 121 and 145 beats per minute. In the respective B sections (&quot;I really want to see you&quot; and &quot;I dunno how I&#x27;m gonna do it&quot;), there is a similar ascent through 5-6-8, but the Chiffons distinctively retain the G tonic for four bars and, on the repeat of the motif, uniquely go to an A-note 9th embellishment over the first syllable of &quot;gonna&quot;. Harrison, on the other hand, introduces the more complex harmony of a relative minor (C#m), as well as the fundamental and distinctly original slide-guitar motif.

While the case was on hold, Harrison and his former bandmates Lennon and Starr chose to sever ties with Klein at the end of March 1973 – an acrimonious split that led to further lawsuits for the three ex-Beatles. Bright Tunes and Harrison later resumed their negotiations. His final offer of 40 percent of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; US composer&#x27;s and publisher&#x27;s royalties, along with a stipulation that he retain copyright for his song, was viewed as a &quot;good one&quot; by Bright&#x27;s legal representation, yet the offer was rejected. It later came to light that Klein had renewed his efforts to purchase the ailing company, now solely for himself, and to that end was supplying Bright Tunes with insider details regarding &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; sales figures and copyright value.

According to journalist Bob Woffinden, writing in 1981, the case would most likely have been settled privately, as so many had been in the past, had Mack still been alive and had &quot;personal ownership of the copyright&quot; been a factor. In the build-up to the case going to court, the Chiffons recorded a version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; in 1975, with the aim of drawing attention to the lawsuit. Author Alan Clayson has described the plagiarism suit as &quot;the most notorious civil action of the decade&quot;, saying that the &quot;extremity&quot; of the proceedings were provoked by a combination of the commercial success of Harrison&#x27;s single and the intervention of &quot;litigation-loving Mr Klein&quot;.

===Court hearing and ruling===
&quot;Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music&quot; went to the United States district court on 23 February 1976, to hear evidence on the allegation of plagiarism. Harrison attended the proceedings in New York, with a guitar, and each side called musical experts to support its argument. Harrison&#x27;s counsel contended that he had drawn inspiration from &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot; and that Mack&#x27;s composition was also derived from that hymn. The judge presiding was Richard Owen, a classical musician and composer of operas in his spare time.

After reconvening in September 1976, the court found that Harrison had subconsciously copied &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, since he admitted to having been aware of the Chiffons&#x27; recording. Owen said in his conclusion to the proceedings:
Did Harrison deliberately use the music of &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;? I do not believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, it is clear that &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; is the very same song as &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; with different words, and Harrison had access to &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.

===Damages and litigation===
With liability established, the court recommended an amount for the damages to be paid by Harrison and Apple to Bright Tunes, which Owen totalled at $1,599,987. This figure amounted to three-quarters of the royalty revenue raised in North America from &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, as well as a significant proportion of that from the &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; album. Some observers have considered this unreasonable and unduly harsh, since it underplayed the unique elements of Harrison&#x27;s recording – the universal spiritual message of its lyrics, the signature guitar hook, and its production – and ignored the acclaim his album received in its own right. The award factored in the royalty revenue raised from &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; inclusion on the recent &quot;Best of George Harrison&quot; compilation, though at a more moderate percentage than for the 1970 album. In the UK, the corresponding damages suit, brought by Peter Maurice Music, was swiftly settled out of court in July 1977.

During the drawn-out damages portion of the US suit, events played into Harrison&#x27;s hands when Klein&#x27;s ABKCO Industries purchased the copyright to &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, and with it all litigation claims, after which Klein proceeded to negotiate sale of the song to Harrison. On 19 February 1981, the court decided that, due to Klein&#x27;s duplicity in the case, Harrison would only have to pay ABKCO $587,000 instead of the $1.6 million award and would also receive the rights to &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; – $587,000 being the amount Klein had paid Bright Tunes for the song in 1978. The court ruled that Klein&#x27;s actions had been in breach of the fiduciary duty owed to Harrison, a duty that continued &quot;even after the principal–agent relationship ended&quot;.

The litigation continued through to the early 1990s as the finer points of the settlement were finally decided. In his 1993 essay on &quot;Bright Tunes v. Harrisongs&quot;, Joseph Self describes it as &quot;without question, one of the longest running legal battles ever to be litigated in [the United States]&quot;. Music journalist David Cavanagh termed it &quot;the most absurd legal black comedy in the annals of rock&quot;. Matters were concluded in March 1998. Harrison retained the rights for both songs in the UK and North America, and Klein was awarded the rights elsewhere in the world.

===Reaction===
The ruling set new legal precedents and was a personal blow for Harrison, who said he was too &quot;paranoid&quot; to write anything new for some time afterwards. Early reaction in the music industry saw Little Richard claim for breach of copyright in a track recorded by the Beatles in 1964 for the &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; album, as well as Ringo Starr credit songwriter Clifford T. Ward as the inspiration for his &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Rotogravure&quot; song &quot;Lady Gaye&quot;.
Shortly before the ruling was handed down in September 1976, Harrison wrote and recorded a song inspired by the court case – the upbeat &quot;This Song&quot;. It includes the lines &quot;This tune has nothing &#x27;Bright&#x27; about it&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t infringe on anyone&#x27;s copyright&quot;. The 1960s soul hits &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, as well as his own composition &quot;You&quot;, are all name-checked in the lyrics, as if to demonstrate the point that, as he later put it, &quot;99 per cent of the popular music that can be heard is reminiscent of something or other.&quot; In &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, Harrison says of the episode: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel guilty or bad about it, in fact [&#x27;My Sweet Lord&#x27;] saved many a heroin addict&#x27;s life. I know the &quot;motive&quot; behind writing the song in the first place and its effect far exceeded the legal hassle.&quot;

According to Woffinden, the ruling came as no surprise in the US. &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; had been a major hit there, unlike in the UK, and American commentators had been quick to scrutinise &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; for its similarities. Woffinden nevertheless wrote that &quot;within the context of rock music, it was an unjust decision&quot; and that Owen &quot;clearly understood nothing of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, or gospel, or popular music&quot; in terms of shared influences. Woffinden commented that, as of 1981, no comparable action over copyright infringement had been launched despite the continuation of this tradition; he cited the appropriation of aspects of Harrison&#x27;s 1966 song &quot;Taxman&quot; in the Jam&#x27;s recent number 1 hit &quot;Start!&quot; as an example of the industry&#x27;s preference for avoiding the courtroom.

When asked to comment on the decision in a 1976 interview, Starr said: &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George&#x27;s version is much heavier than the Chiffons – he might have done it with the original in the back of his mind, but he&#x27;s just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court.&quot; In his 1980 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, John Lennon expressed doubt about the notion of &quot;subconscious&quot; plagiarism, saying of Harrison: &quot;He must have known, you know. He&#x27;s smarter than that ... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he just let it go and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off.&quot; McCartney conceded that the Beatles &quot;stole a lot of stuff&quot; from other artists. In a 2008 interview, he said Harrison taking from &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; was justified because Harrison had avoided the &quot;boy–girl thing&quot; and offered an important spiritual message.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavanagh/Uncut&quot;&gt;David Cavanagh, &quot;George Harrison: The Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot;, August 2008, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrospective reviews and legacy==
AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger says of the song&#x27;s international popularity: My Sweet Lord&#x27; has a quasi-religious feel, but nevertheless has enough conventional pop appeal to reach mainstream listeners who may or may not care to dig into the spiritual lyrical message.&quot; Some Christian fundamentalist anti-rock activists have objected that chanting &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; in &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was anti-Christian or Satanic, while some born-again Christians adopted the song as an anthem. Simon Leng describes the slide guitar motif as &quot;among the best-known guitar passages in popular music&quot;. Ian Inglis highlights the combination of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;evident lack of artifice&quot; and Spector&#x27;s &quot;excellent production&quot;, such that &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; can be heard &quot;as a prayer, a love song, an anthem, a contemporary gospel track, or a piece of perfect pop&quot;.

According to music historians David Luhrssen and Michael Larson, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; &quot;became an early battleground over music as intellectual property&quot; and the ruling against Harrison &quot;opened a floodgate of suits over allegedly similar melodies and chord progressions&quot;. In a 2016 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article on landmark music copyright cases, the suit is credited with establishing &quot;a precedent of harsher copyright standards&quot; as well as &quot;introducing the phrase &#x27;subconscious plagiarism&#x27; into the popular lexicon&quot;. Writing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 2013, author and neurologist Oliver Sacks cited the case when stating his preference for the word cryptomnesia over plagiarism, which he said was &quot;suggestive of crime and deceit&quot;. Sacks added that Owen had displayed &quot;psychological insight and sympathy&quot; in deeming Harrison&#x27;s infringement to have been &quot;subconsciously accomplished&quot;.

Due to the plagiarism suit, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; became stigmatised. While acknowledging the similarity with &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, music critic David Fricke describes Harrison&#x27;s composition as &quot;the honest child of black American sacred song&quot;. Jayson Greene of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writes that the court ruling of subconscious plagiarism &quot;could be a good euphemism for &#x27;pop songwriting generally, and the episode was &quot;doubly ironic considering Harrison&#x27;s intrinsic generosity as an artist&quot;. In a 2001 review, Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; serves as the entrance to Spector&#x27;s &quot;cathedral of sound&quot; on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, adding that although Harrison lost the lawsuit, the song&#x27;s &quot;towering majesty... remains undiminished&quot;. Mikal Gilmore calls it an &quot;irresistible devotional&quot;. In 2009, pop culture critic Roy Trakin commented that if music fans were in doubt as to Harrison&#x27;s enduring influence, they should &quot;listen to Wilco&#x27;s latest album for a song called &#x27;You Never Know&#x27;, which is even closer to &#x27;My Sweet Lord&#x27; than that one was to &#x27;He&#x27;s So Fine&#x27;, with its slide guitar lines practically an homage to the original.&quot; David Simons of &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot; magazine says that, further to his contributions to the Beatles&#x27; recordings, Harrison &quot;elevated the sound and scope of recorded acoustic guitar&quot; with his debut single.

In their written tributes to Harrison shortly after his death, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards each named &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; among their personal favourites of all his songs, along with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. In 2010, AOL Radio listeners voted it the best song from Harrison&#x27;s solo years. According to a chart published by PPL in August 2018, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Apple Records&#x27; founding, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; had received the most airplay in the 21st century of any song released by the record label, ahead of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot;.

&quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was ranked 454th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2004 and 460th on the magazine&#x27;s revised list in 2010. It has also appeared in the following critics&#x27; best-song lists and books, among others: &quot;The 7,500 Most Important Songs of 1944–2000&quot; by author Bruce Pollock (2005), Dave Thompson&#x27;s &quot;1000 Songs That Rock Your World&quot; (2011; ranked at number 247), &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Classic Rock Songs&quot; (2013; number 56), the &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Songs of the 1970s&quot; (2012; number 65), and the same magazine&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; (2014; number 270).

==Re-releases and alternative versions==
Since its initial release on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; has appeared on the 1976 compilation &quot;The Best of George Harrison&quot; and 2009&#x27;s career-spanning &quot;Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison&quot;. The original UK single (with &quot;What Is Life&quot; as the B-side) was reissued on Christmas Eve 1976 in Britain – a &quot;provocative&quot; move by EMI, given the publicity the lawsuit had attracted that year for the song. The song appears in the 2017 Marvel Studios film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;, and it is included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

To promote the 50th anniversary reissue of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; in December 2021, the Harrison estate released a music video for the 2020 mix of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blistein/RollingStone&quot;&gt;Jon Blistein, &quot;Ringo Starr Chucks Popcorn at Fred Armisen in Video for George Harrison&#x27;s &#x27;My Sweet Lord, rollingstone.com, 15 December 2021 (retrieved 18 December 2021).&lt;/ref&gt; Executive produced by Dhani Harrison and David Zonshine, it was written and directed by Lance Bangs, and stars Mark Hamill, Vanessa Bayer and Fred Armisen as secret agents investigating a mysterious phenomenon around Los Angeles. Much of the video follows Armisen&#x27;s perspective, from a room filled with books to a large cinema showing a fictional film of George Harrison&#x27;s home footage, titled &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. The video features cameos from many celebrities – including Patton Oswalt, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Ringo Starr, Jeff Lynne, Joe Walsh, Dhani and Olivia Harrison – and ends with Armisen and Bayer&#x27;s characters solving the mystery by hearing the song for the first time on their car radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSL video/YouTube&quot;&gt;&quot;George Harrison – My Sweet Lord (Official Music Video)&quot;, George Harrison/YouTube, 15 December 2021 (retrieved 18 December 2021).&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975 – &quot;The Pirate Song&quot;===
On 26 December 1975, Harrison made a guest appearance on his friend Eric Idle&#x27;s BBC2 comedy show &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;, sending up his serious public image, and seemingly about to perform &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;.

As a running gag in the show, Harrison interrupts the proceedings, hoping for an acting role as &quot;Pirate Bob&quot;, dressed in a pirate costume with a parrot on his shoulder. He gets turned down each time by Idle and &quot;RWT&quot; regular Neil Innes, who simply want him to play the part of &quot;George Harrison&quot;. At the end, dressed in more normal attire and backed by the house band, Harrison appears on stage strumming the introduction to &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; on acoustic guitar. Instead of continuing with the song, Harrison takes his chance to play Pirate Bob by abruptly segueing into a sea shanty. Idle, in his role as a &quot;greasy&quot; compère, reacts with horror and attempts to have Harrison removed from the studio.

This performance is known as &quot;The Pirate Song&quot;, co-written by Harrison and Idle, and the recording is only available unofficially on bootleg compilations such as &quot;Pirate Songs&quot;. Commenting on the parallels with Harrison&#x27;s real-life reluctance to play the pop star, Simon Leng writes, &quot;there was great resonance within these gags.&quot;

===2001 – &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000)&quot;===
In January 2001, Harrison included a new version of the song as a bonus track on the remastered &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; album. Titled &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000)&quot;, it features Harrison sharing vocals with Sam Brown, the daughter of his friend Joe Brown, backed by mostly new instrumentation, including acoustic guitar by his son Dhani and tambourine by Ray Cooper. The track opens with a &quot;snippet&quot; of sitar, in Leng&#x27;s description, to &quot;emphasize its spiritual roots&quot;. Harrison said that his motivation for remaking the song was partly to &quot;play a better slide guitar solo&quot;. As further reasons, he cited the &quot;spiritual response&quot; that the song had long received, together with his interest in reworking the tune to avoid the contentious musical notes. Of the extended slide-guitar break on &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000)&quot;, Leng writes: &quot;[Harrison] had never made so clear a musical statement that his signature bottleneck sound was as much his tool for self-expression as his vocal cords.&quot; Elliot Huntley opines that Harrison&#x27;s vocal was more &quot;gospel inflected&quot; and perhaps even more sincere than on the original recording, &quot;given his deteriorating health&quot; during the final year of his life.

This version also appeared on the January 2002 posthumous release of the &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; charity CD single, comprising the original &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, Harrison&#x27;s reworking, and the acoustic run-through of &quot;Let It Down&quot; (with recent overdubs, another 2001 bonus track). Proceeds went to Harrison&#x27;s Material World Charitable Foundation for dispersal to selected charities, apart from in the United States, where proceeds went to the Self Realization Fellowship. For some months after the single release, a portion of &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000)&quot; looped on Harrison&#x27;s official website over screen images of lotus petals scattering and re-forming. It also appears on the 2014 &quot;Apple Years 1968–75&quot; reissue of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marchese/SecondDisc&quot;&gt;Joe Marchese, &quot;Give Me Love: George Harrison&#x27;s &#x27;Apple Years&#x27; Are Collected on New Box Set&quot;, &quot;The Second Disc&quot;, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 26 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 – Demo version===
In November 2011, a demo of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, with Harrison backed by just Voormann and Starr, was included on the deluxe edition CD accompanying the British DVD release of Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; documentary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early Takes/AM&quot;&gt;Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;George Harrison: &quot;Early Takes, Vol. 1&quot;&quot;, AllMusic (retrieved 15 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The trio recorded the song at EMI Studios on 26 May 1970, on the first of two days dedicated to taping demos of compositions under consideration for &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.

Giles Martin, who helped organise Harrison&#x27;s recordings archive at Friar Park for the film project, described the track as an early &quot;live take&quot;. The demo was released internationally in May 2012 on the &quot;Early Takes: Volume 1&quot; compilation. In his album review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Frick deemed this version of the song an &quot;acoustic hosanna&quot;.

==Harrison live versions==
Harrison performed &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; at every one of his relatively few solo concerts, starting with the two Concert for Bangladesh shows at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden on 1 August 1971. The recording released on the subsequent live album was taken from the evening show and begins with Harrison&#x27;s spoken &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; over his opening acoustic-guitar chords. Among the 24 backing musicians was a &quot;Soul Choir&quot; featuring singers Claudia Lennear, Dolores Hall and Joe Greene, but it was Harrison who sang the end-of-song Guru Stotram prayer in his role as lead vocalist, unlike on the studio recording (where it was sung by the backing chorus). The slide guitar parts were played by Eric Clapton and Jesse Ed Davis.

During his 1974 North American tour, Harrison&#x27;s only one there as a solo artist, he performed &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; as the encore at each show. In contrast with the subtle shift from &quot;hallelujah&quot;s to Sanskrit chants on his 1970 original, Harrison used the song to engage his audience in kirtan, the practice of &quot;chanting the holy names of the Lord&quot; in Indian religions – from &quot;Om Christ!&quot; and Krishna, to Buddha and Allah – with varying degrees of success. Backed by a band that again included Billy Preston, Harrison turned &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; into an extended gospel-funk piece, closer in its arrangement to Preston&#x27;s &quot;Encouraging Words&quot; version and lasting up to ten minutes.

Harrison&#x27;s second and final solo tour took place in Japan in December 1991, with Clapton&#x27;s band. A live version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; recorded at the Tokyo Dome, on 14 December, was released the following year on the &quot;Live in Japan&quot; album.

==Cover versions and tributes==
&quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; attracted many cover versions in the early 1970s and was the most performed song of 1971. Its coinciding with a trend for spirituality in rock music ensured it was frequently performed on religious-themed television shows. The song was also popular among supper club performers following recordings by artists such as Johnny Mathis.

The song was accepted as an authentic work in the gospel tradition; in music journalist Chris Ingham&#x27;s description, it became a &quot;genuine gospel classic&quot;. Many of the Christian cover artists have omitted the mantra lyrics on religious grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breihan/Stereogum&quot;&gt;Tom Breihan, &quot;The Number Ones: George Harrison&#x27;s &#x27;My Sweet Lord, &quot;Stereogum&quot;, 18 January 2019 (retrieved 21 October 2020).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Nina Simone released an 18-minute gospel reworking of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, performed live at Fort Dix before a group of African-American soldiers. It served as an anti-Vietnam War statement and the centrepiece of her album &quot;Emergency Ward!&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis/FT&quot;&gt;Jon Dennis, &quot;Life of a Song: My Sweet Lord – the song that earned George Harrison a lawsuit&quot;, ft.com, 31 July 2018 (retrieved 23 October 2020).&lt;/ref&gt; which also included an 11-minute version of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;. Simone interspersed the song with the David Nelson poem &quot;Today Is a Killer&quot;, giving the performance an apocalyptic ending.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson/AM&quot;&gt;Mark Richardson, &quot;Nina Simone &quot;Emergency Ward!&quot;&quot;, AllMusic (retrieved 16 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was the most covered song written and released by any of the former Beatles since the band&#x27;s break-up. Edwin Starr and Byron Lee and the Dragonaires were among the other artists who recorded it.

In April 2002, Elton John, Sting, James Taylor, Ravi Shankar, Anoushka Shankar and others performed &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; to close the Harrison-tribute opening portion of the Rock for the Rainforest benefit concert, held at Carnegie Hall in New York City. At the Concert for George on 29 November 2002, it was performed by Billy Preston.

On July 28, 2023, Damian “Jr. Gong” Marley released a single of his cover of “My Sweet Lord”. Marley said that he chose to cover “My Sweet Lord” because he “heard the song and liked it.” Afterwards, Marley learned that his father, Bob Marley, and George Harrison had met in 1975.

<text>Richard Green (September 1, 1936 – July 1, 1983) was an American professional boxing referee. He officiated several major bouts, such as Muhammad Ali vs. Larry Holmes in 1980. He was the referee for the lightweight world title fight between defending champion Ray Mancini and challenger Duk Koo Kim, which caused Kim&#x27;s death four days after the fight ended. Green died by suicide eight months later.

== Background ==
Green was a native of Louisiana and a Golden Gloves boxer in the 1960s.

== Career as referee ==
Green presided over several notable fights. One of these was Muhammad Ali&#x27;s loss to Larry Holmes in 1980.

Green officiated two high-profile fights in 1982. Early in the year, he refereed Wilfred Benítez&#x27;s fight against Roberto Durán for Benitez&#x27;s super welterweight title. Later, he was the referee in Ray Mancini&#x27;s first-round knockout of Arturo Frias, a win that gave Mancini the WBA lightweight championship.

On November 13, 1982, Green was assigned to work Mancini&#x27;s second defense of that title, a match against Korean contender Duk-Koo Kim that was televised across the nation by CBS. The fight ended when Green stopped it after Kim was knocked down early in the fourteenth round, but Kim had taken a severe beating from Mancini throughout the fight and collapsed in the ring shortly thereafter. Four days after the fight, Kim died of massive brain injuries.

The Kim-Mancini bout proved to be a watershed in boxing, triggering a series of major changes to the sport. Championship bouts were reduced from 15 to 12 rounds, the standing eight count was introduced, and fighters had to undergo more stringent medical tests before a match.

Green&#x27;s last fight was a USBA Heavyweight Championship fight on May 20, 1983, that saw Greg Page defeat Renaldo Snipes in a 12-round decision. Six weeks later, Green was found dead in his North Las Vegas home. The coroner ruled the death a suicide via self-inflicted gunshot.

<doc id="1117237" wikidata="Q4180469" url="?curid=1117237" title="Diarylethene">
<text>Diarylethene is the general name of a class of chemical compounds that have aromatic functional groups bonded to each end of a carbon–carbon double bond. The simplest example is stilbene, which has two geometric isomers, E and Z.

Under the influence of light, these compounds can generally perform two kinds of reversible isomerizations:
*E to Z isomerizations, most common for stilbenes (and azobenzenes). This process goes through an excited state energy minimum where the aromatic rings lie at 90° to each other. This conformation drops to the ground state and generally relaxes to trans and cis forms in a 1:1 ratio, thus the quantum yield for E-Z isomerization is very rarely greater than 0.5.
*6π electrocyclizations of the Z form, leading to an additional bond between the two aryl functionalities and a disruption of the aromatic character of these groups. The quantum yield of this reaction is generally less than 0.1, and in most diarylethenes the close-ring form is thermally unstable, reverting to the cis-form in a matter of seconds or minutes under ambient conditions.

Thermal isomerization is also possible. In E-Z isomerization, the thermal equilibrium lies well towards the trans-form because of its lower energy (~15 kJ mol−1 in stilbene). The activation energy for thermal E-Z isomerization is 150–190 kJ mol−1 for stilbene, meaning that temperatures above 200°C are required to isomerize stilbene at a reasonable rate, but most derivatives have lower energy barriers (e.g. 65 kJ mol−1 for 4-aminostilbene). The activation energy of the electrocyclization is 73 kJ mol−1 for stilbene.

Both processes are often applied in molecular switches and for photochromism (reversible state changes from exposure to light).

After the 6π electrocyclization of the Z form to the &quot;close-ring&quot; form, most unsubstituted diarylethenes are prone to oxidation, leading to a re-aromatization of the π-system. The most common example is (E)-stilbene, which upon irradiation undergoes an E to Z isomerization, which can be followed by a 6π electrocyclization. Reaction of the product of this reaction with molecular oxygen affords phenanthrene, and it has been suggested by some studies that dehydrogenation may even occur spontaneously. The dihydrophenanthrene intermediate has never been isolated, but it has been detected spectroscopically in pump-probe experiments by virtue of its long wavelength optical absorption band. Although both the E-Z isomerization and the 6π electrocyclization are reversible processes, this oxidation renders the entire sequence irreversible.

==Stabilization of the closed-ring form to oxidation==

One solution to the problem of oxidation is to replace the hydrogens ortho to the carbon-carbon double bond by groups that can not be removed during the oxidation. Following the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, the photochemical 6π cyclization takes place in a conrotatory fashion, leading to products with an anti configuration of the methyl substituents. As both methyl groups are attached to a stereogenic center, two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) are formed, normally as a racemic mixture. This approach also has the advantage that the thermal (disrotatory) ring closure can not take place because of steric hindrance between the substitution groups.

==Dithienylethenes==

Ortho-substitution of the aromatic units results in a stabilization against oxidation, but the closed-ring form still has a low thermodynamic stability in most cases (e.g. 2,3-dimesityl-2-butene has a half-life of 90 seconds at 20°C). This problem can be addressed by lowering the aromaticity of the system. The most commonly used example are the dithienylethenes, i.e. alkenes with a thiophene ring on either side. 

Dithienylethene derivatives have shown different types of photochemical side reactions, e.g., oxidation or elimination reactions of the ring-closed isomer and formation of an annulated ring isomer as a byproduct of the photochromic reaction. In order to overcome the first, the 2-position of the thiophenes is substituted with a methyl group, preventing oxidation of the ring closed form. Also often the two free α-positions on the double bond are connected in a 5 or 6-membered ring in order to lock the double bond into the cis-form. This makes the dithienylethene undergo only open-closed ring isomerization, unconfused by E-Z isomerization. More recently, based on recent findings showing that by-product formation most likely occurs exclusively from the lowest singlet excited state, a superior fatigue resistance of dithienylethenes upon visible-light excitation has been achieved by attaching small triplet-sensitizing moieties to the diarylethene core via a -conjugated linkage.

The dithienylethenes are also of interest for the fact that their isomerization requires very little change of shape. This means that their isomerization in a solid matrix can take place much more quickly than with most other photochromic molecules. In the case of some analogs, photochromic behavior can even be carried out in single crystals without disrupting the crystal structure.

==Applications==
Typically, the open-ring isomers are colorless compounds, whereas the closed-ring isomers have colors dependent on their chemical structure, due to the extended conjugation along the molecular backbone. Therefore, many diarylethenes have photochromic behavior both in solution and in solid state. Moreover, these two isomers differ from one another not only in their absorption spectra but also in various physical and chemical properties, such as their refractive index, dielectric constant, and oxidation-reduction potential. These properties can be readily controlled by reversible isomerization between the open- and closed-ring states using photoirradiation, and thus they have been suggested for use in optical data storage and 3D optical data storage in particular. The closed form has a conjugated path from one end of the molecule to the other, whereas the open form has not. This allows for the electronic communication between functional groups attached to the far ends of the diarylethene to be switched on and off using UV and visible light.

<text>Jeffrey St. Clair (born 1959 in Indianapolis, Indiana) is an investigative journalist, writer, and editor. He has been a co editor of &quot;CounterPunch&quot; since 1999.

==Biography==
St Clair was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and attended American University in Washington, D.C., majoring in English and history. In the late 1970s he protested construction of the Marble Hill Nuclear Power Plant.
He has worked as an environmental organizer and writer for Friends of the Earth, Clean Water Action, and the Hoosier Environmental Council.

In 1990, he moved to Oregon to edit the environmental magazine &quot;Forest Watch&quot;. In 1994, he joined journalists Alexander Cockburn and Ken Silverstein on &quot;CounterPunch&quot; and has contributed as an author since. He co-edited &quot;CounterPunch&quot; from 1999 to 2012 with Cockburn until the latter&#x27;s death in 2012. St. Clair has served as an editor since 2012, joined by managing editor Joshua Frank in 2012.

St. Clair is a former contributing editor to the monthly magazine &quot;In These Times&quot;. He has also written for &quot;The Progressive&quot;.

In 1998, he published his first book, with Cockburn, &quot;Whiteout: the CIA, Drugs and the Press&quot;, a history of the CIA&#x27;s alleged ties to drug gangs from World War II to the Mujahideen and Nicaraguan Contras. This was followed by &quot;A Field Guide to Environmental Bad Guys&quot; (with James Ridgeway), and with Cockburn, &quot;Five Days that Shook the World: Seattle and Beyond&quot;, and &quot;Al Gore: a User&#x27;s Manual&quot;.

St. Clair co-authored a weekly syndicated column with Alexander Cockburn called &quot;Nature and Politics.&quot; The 65 articles were published 2003 in &quot;Been Brown So Long It Looked Like Green to Me: the Politics of Nature&quot;. It has been called a virtual handbook for radical environmentalists.

&quot;Grand Theft Pentagon&quot;, and &quot;Born Under a Bad Sky: Notes from the Dark Side of the Earth&quot;. His book, &quot;Bernie and the Sandernistas: Field Notes from a Failed Revolution&quot;, was published in late-2016.

As of 2009 St. Clair was married, had college aged children and lived in Oregon City, Oregon.

==Reception==
St. Clair has been mentioned as being in the &quot;finest journalistic traditions&quot; of the US going back to Oregon journalist John Reed and I.F. Stone.

<text>Pamela Corkery (born 1956) is a New Zealand journalist, broadcaster, and former politician who served one term (1996–1999) as a member of Parliament for the left-wing Alliance party.

==Private life==
Corkery (née Mc Nutt) was born in the South Island, and grew up in Dunedin. She has been married three times, and has two children.

==Member of Parliament==

A well-known journalist and talk-back host in New Zealand, she first entered politics standing as an independent candidate for the Auckland mayoralty in 1995.

She then became a high-profile parliamentary candidate for the Alliance party, and was elected to Parliament as a list MP in the 1996 election. She left Parliament in 1999 after one term. In her 1999 book &quot;Pam&#x27;s Political Confessions&quot;, she wrote, &quot;Politicians are, by and large, far more self-deluding, devious, bloated, insecure, egocentric wankers than I had feared.&quot; (p. 9).

==Professional career==
After leaving Parliament, she returned to her work as a journalist, and talk-back host at Radio Pacific.

Corkery presented the live interview show &quot;The Last Word&quot; on TV One from March 2003 until the show was cancelled in September 2003. She appeared in a 2008 episode of the TV travelogue &quot;Intrepid Journeys&quot;, being shot at point-blank range with a 9 mm pistol, while wearing a ballistic vest in Colombia. She has fronted two documentaries for the TV3 show &quot;Inside New Zealand&quot;, looking at the nation&#x27;s gangs. For &quot;The Gangs&quot;, which aired in 2008, she spent 18 months with the gangs, including filming an operating methamphetamine lab. The second documentary &quot;The Truth about Asian Crime&quot; aired in 2009; police cancelled interviews planned for the programme, saying they believed Corkery had a conflict of interest.

With business partner Rebekah Hay, she announced in 2010 that she would be opening Pammy&#x27;s, &quot;the world&#x27;s first legal bordello [...] exclusively for female clients&quot;. The Auckland bordello ran an ad in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; offering NZ$240 an hour for male prostitutes. Her application for a resource consent was withdrawn in April 2011.

==Internet Party==
In May 2014, Corkery was hired as the press secretary to Laila Harré, the leader of the newly established Internet Party. During the 2014 general election campaign, Corkery labelled a journalist a &quot;puffed-up little shit&quot; at the campaign launch for the Internet Party on 25 August 2014. The comments were made in reaction to requests by journalists for interviews with party founder Kim Dotcom about comments he had made suggesting he had hacked a German credit rating system.

Following the 2014 election, despite no formal announcement of her resignation from the role as press secretary, Corkery has not engaged with the Internet Party publicly, and returned to occasional editorial pieces with the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; and other media services.

<text>The Liverpool Sessions is the debut EP release of singer-songwriter Tracy Bonham, released in 1995. &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; noted its &quot;stylistic stretches—a torch ballad, psychedelia, a kid&#x27;s song, hardcore&quot;, featuring &quot;the rough-hewn pop gem &#x27;Dandelion&#x27;, the thrashy, new-wavish &#x27;18 Heads Roll By&#x27;, and the punkish rant &#x27;I&#x27;m Not a Waif&#x27;.&quot; In a &quot;Hits Magazine&quot; interview, Bonham herself called it &quot;a good record [... but] a rush job and a little immature.&quot;

<text>Hans Brunhart (; born 28 March 1945) is a politician and journalist from Liechtenstein who served as Prime Minister of Liechtenstein from 1978 to 1993. He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister of Liechtenstein from 1974 to 1978, under the government of Walter Kieber.

==Prime Minister of Liechtenstein==
Brunhart was Deputy Prime Minister of Liechtenstein under the government of Walter Kieber from 27 March 1974 to 26 April 1978. He was Prime Minister of Liechtenstein, serving from 26 April 1978 to 26 May 1993. The 1978 Liechtenstein general election resulted in a win for the Patriotic Union, and Brunhart was appointed as Prime Minister.
Brunhart&#x27;s tenure was marked by significant changes in Liechtenstein&#x27;s foreign policy. In 1978, Liechtenstein joined the Council of Europe, and Brunhart, along with Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein, held the presidency of the Committee of Ministers in 1987. In addition, Liechtenstein became a full member of the United Nations in 1990 following Security Council Resolution 663. Under his government, Liechtenstein became a member of the European Free Trade Association in its own right in 1991.

During his tenure, women received voting rights for the first time, following a referendum on the topic (among men only) in 1984.

=== 1992 crisis ===

On 6 December 1992 a referendum was to be held in Switzerland on a federal resolution on the accession to the European Economic Area (EEA). In correspondence with the customs union between the two countries, a similar referendum was to be held in Liechtenstein at a similar time.

When planning on the date for the Liechtenstein referendum regarding accession to the EEA, prince Hans-Adam II called for it to be held in advance of the corresponding one in Switzerland, against the wishes of the Brunhart and the Landtag of Liechtenstein. On 28 October 1992, he threatened to dismiss the Landtag and Brunhart&#x27;s government over the dispute and appoint an acting prime minister in his place.

In response approximately 2000 people demonstrated in front of the government house in Vaduz. The same day, the government and Hans-Adam II negotiated and came to an agreement that scheduled the referendum after the corresponding one in Switzerland, though notably it affirmed that Liechtenstein would commit to agreements with the EEA despite the result in Switzerland. Liechtenstein subsequently joined the EEA in May the same year.

=== Resignation ===
The February 1993 Liechtenstein general election resulted in a win for the Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party. As a result, Brunhart resigned on 26 May 1993 and was succeeded by Markus Büchel.

==Later life==

From 1996 to 2012, Brunhart was chairman of the board directors of the VP Bank. He has been an honorary member of the Patriotic Union since 1996 and is occasionally still consulted in politics, most recently by Daniel Risch in 2022.

From 2004 to 2006 he was president of the Liechtenstein-Switzerland society and since 2004 president of the board of trustees in Haus Gutenberg foundation in Balzers. In 1995, Brunhart founded the annual magazine &quot;Balzner Neujahrsblätter&quot; and has remained an editor since.

== Personal life ==
Brunhart married Bernadette Biedermann (born 5 August 1945) on 18 November 1972 and they have three children together. 

His brother, Arthur Brunhart, served as President of the Landtag of Liechtenstein from 2009 to 2013.

== Honours ==

<text>Richard James Gerard (born 20 October 1936) is a former New Zealand politician. He was a National Party Member of Parliament from 1984 to 1997.

==Early life==
Gerard was born on 20 October 1936 in Canterbury. His father was the National MP Geoff Gerard. Gerard received his education at Christ&#x27;s College and then became a sheep farmer in Cheviot. He held several roles with Federated Farmers.

==Political career==
Gerard served on the Oxford County Council for some time. He was the National Party chair of the Rangiora electorate for eight years.

===Member of Parliament===



He was first elected to Parliament in the 1984 election, replacing the retiring Derek Quigley in the Rangiora electorate. He remained MP for Rangiora until the 1996 election, when the electorate was abolished. Gerard was unsuccessful in his campaign for the new Waimakariri electorate, losing to former Labour Party leader Mike Moore. He remained in Parliament as a list MP.

In 1990, Gerard was elected Chairman of Committees. Until 1992, the Chairman of Committees was known as the Deputy Speaker only when presiding over the House. On 10 November 1992, the position of Deputy Speaker was made official under the Standing Orders, and the role of Chairman of Committees was discontinued, with Gerard becoming the first Deputy Speaker. He held that role until 13 December 1996.

In April 1997, he resigned from Parliament to become New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to Canada in Ottawa. This was the first resignation by a list MP since New Zealand adopted the mixed-member proportional electoral system. Gerard was replaced by the next candidate on National&#x27;s party list, Annabel Young.

In 1990, Gerard received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1999 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

===Waimakariri District===
Gerard was elected Mayor of Waimakariri in 2001. He was re-elected in 2004, but lost the mayoralty in 2007 to Ron Keating. In October 2010, he was elected councillor for Waimakariri and was again returned to that role in 2013. At the 2016 and 2019 local elections, Gerard did not contest a councillor position; instead, he contested and was elected to the Rangiora community board.

<text>Charles Marsh (July 10, 1765January 11, 1849) was an American politician from Vermont. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives.

==Biography==
Marsh was born in Lebanon in the Connecticut Colony, to Joseph Marsh and Dorothy Mason. He settled with his parents in Vermont before the Revolutionary War. After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1786, he studied law and was admitted to the bar. He began the practice of law in Woodstock, Vermont, where he continued to practice law for about fifty years. He became the senior member of the profession in Vermont, and among those who studied in his office in preparation to become attorneys was Nicholas Baylies, who served as a Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. He was appointed by George Washington to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont, and served from 1797 until 1801.

Marsh was elected as a Federalist candidate to the Fourteenth United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1815, until March 3, 1817. He founded the American Colonization Society while in Washington.

He was prominent in the Dartmouth College controversy and was a trustee of Dartmouth College from 1809 until 1849. Marsh became a member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in 1809.

Marsh received the degree of LL.D. from Dartmouth College in 1828. He was a liberal benefactor of various missionary and Bible societies, president of the Vermont Bible Society, vice president of the American Bible Society, and vice president of the American Education Society.

==Family life==
Marsh married Anna Collins in 1789. They had two children, Charles Marsh and Anna Marsh. Marsh married Susan Perkins on June 3, 1798. They had five children together; Lyndon Arnold Marsh, George Perkins Marsh, Joseph Marsh, Sarah Marsh, and Charles Marsh.

Marsh&#x27;s father, Joseph Marsh, was a Vermont officer in the American Revolution, a member of the Vermont House of Representatives, and the first Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. His son George Perkins Marsh (1801–1882) was an environmentalist, a member of the United States Congress, and a diplomat. His nephew James Marsh (1794–1842) was a noted Congregational clergyman and writer.

==Death==
Marsh died on January 11, 1849, in Woodstock, Vermont.

His early 19th-century house, now much altered with Victorian features, is the centerpiece of Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park and is a National Historic Landmark (primarily for its association with his son George Perkins Marsh), and his c. 1797 law office building (now a private residence and moved from its original location) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>GTS/BKN are Australian regional television stations serving the Spencer Gulf of South Australia and the Broken Hill area of New South Wales.

The stations are owned and operated by Southern Cross Austereo and based in Port Pirie with satellite offices in Broken Hill, Port Augusta, Whyalla and Port Lincoln, and playout facilities based in Hobart.

The station&#x27;s name originates from the Port Pirie and Broken Hill stations&#x27; callsigns, GTS Port Pirie and BKN Broken Hill.

==History==
GTS signed on for the first time on 1 March 1968. BKN followed soon afterward, on 16 August. In 1974, the stations (and their repeaters) merged to form Spencer Gulf Telecasters and broadcast under the name &quot;GTS/BKN Television&quot;, and later, &quot;Central GTS/BKN&quot;. The company was bought by Southern Cross Broadcasting (SCB) in 2001, though it retained the Central name and branding until the end of 2005.

Due to their areas&#x27; sparse populations, after aggregation they remained among the few stations in Australia that continued to cherry-pick programming from all three networks, though from 2001 onward, it began favouring Seven through its affiliation with Southern Cross Television.

In 2003, Spencer Gulf Telecasters won the right to broadcast a second station in the same area, and in January 2004, started broadcasting SGS/SCN as a Ten affiliate. Since 31 October 2010, GTS/BKN has also operated a third station relaying Nine Network programming from Sydney and Adelaide, under the callsigns GDS in Port Pirie and BDN in Broken Hill.

In January 2006, Central GTS/BKN was renamed &quot;Southern Cross GTS/BKN&quot;, changing its logo to the corporate star branding used by TNT Tasmania and TND Darwin.

In July 2018, Southern Cross GTS/BKN was renamed &quot;Seven GTS/BKN&quot;, reverting to the Seven Network branding, as currently used by Southern Cross stations in Tasmania and Darwin.

===Digital channels===

On 31 October 2010, GTS/BKN launched GDS/BDN, a Channel Nine affiliate rebroadcasting TCN Sydney. On 11 January 2011, GTS/BKN launched Ten&#x27;s SD multichannel Eleven. Starting from 7 November 2011, GTS/BKN slowly rolled out 9Gem, 9Go!, 7two, 7mate and One as digital channels across the GTS/BKN areas.

On 7 December 2013, GDS/BDN switched to a feed of NWS Adelaide. On 30 September 2018, GDS/BDN launched 9Life.

Southern Cross Austereo launched 7HD, 9HD, and 10 HD in the Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill areas in March 2020, via the stations GTS/BKN, GDS/BDN, and SGS/SCN, while also making 7mate, 9Gem, and 10 Bold all SD channels to accommodate the aforementioned HD channels. The following are the changes that occurred on 19 March 2020: 7HD launched on LCN 60, 7mate moved from LCN 60 to LCN 63 and became a SD channel, and the main Seven channel was made available on both LCNs 6 and 61. 10 HD was launched on LCN 50. 10 Peach was moved from LCN 55 to LCN 53, 10 Bold was moved from LCN 50 to LCN 52 and became an SD channel, while the main 10 channel was made available on both LCNs 5 and 51. Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s Nine channel adjustments occurred in late March 2020; the following is a list of GDS/BDN channel changes that occurred in March 2020: 9HD was made available on LCN 80, the main Nine channel was made available on both LCNs 8 and 81, 9Go! was moved to LCN 83 from LCN 88, and 9Gem was moved to LCN 82 from LCN 80 and became a SD channel.

==Programming==
The main GTS/BKN service carries programming from the Seven Network, including the Adelaide edition of Seven News&#x27; nightly 6pm bulletin.

GDS/BDN broadcasts programs from the Nine Network, including the state bulletin from NWS from Adelaide.

===Local programming===
GTS/BKN produced a wide range of local programming throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Panel Probe&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Cue&quot;, sports coverage, local documentaries and a nightly epilogue. The station also produced its own local commercials.

===News===
For over 50 years, GTS / BKN ran a regional news service for its viewing area, initially as a 10-minute mid-evening bulletin before gradually expanding to a full half-hour program each weeknight.

The bulletin aired under numerous titles such as &quot;GTS / BKN News&quot;, &quot;Central News&quot; and &quot;Southern Cross News&quot;, before relaunching as &quot;Nightly News&quot; in January 2019.

The news service retained reporters and video journalists based at bureaus in Port Pirie, Broken Hill, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Whyalla, although in later years, presentation for the bulletin was moved from the Port Pirie studios to Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s Canberra headquarters, and latterly, the company&#x27;s Hobart studio.

Presenters and reporters included Rosanna Mangiarelli, Will McDonald, Virginia Langeberg, Tim Hatfield, Fraser Goldsworthy, Julie Snook, and at the time of the bulletin&#x27;s axing, Madeline Kerr and John Hunt, with weather presenter Alex Sykes.

In 2019, &quot;Nightly News&quot; was moved from GTS / BKN to sister station 7two, airing at 7pm on weeknights following the Adelaide-based edition of &quot;Seven News&quot; on the main channel.

On 13 April 2023, Southern Cross Austereo announced it was ceasing production of GTS / BKN&#x27;s local news service, effective immediately, marking the end of local television programming for the Spencer Gulf and Broken Hill areas. According to other media outlets, some staff working on the program had not been informed that the final bulletin had been broadcast until after it aired.

GTS / BKN&#x27;s &quot;Nightly News&quot; was the last regional TV news service to be produced in South Australia, following the end of WIN News&#x27; bulletins for the Mount Gambier and Riverland areas in February 2013.

<text>The Burdens of Being Upright is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Tracy Bonham, released on March 19, 1996, by Island Records.

==Content==
&quot;The Burdens of Being Upright&quot; was recorded in the summer of 1995 at Fort Apache Studios in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Referencing this album, in 2015 Bonham said, The album cover (a reference to German photographer August Sander&#x27;s work &quot;The Bricklayer&quot;) was photographed by George DuBose, who was the in-house photographer at the hip hop label Cold Chillin&#x27; Records.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;The Burdens of Being Upright&quot; debuted at number 136 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart dated April 27, 1996, and later reached its peak position of number 54 on the chart on June 15, 1996. It remained on the chart for 25 weeks. On November 12, 1996, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying the shipment of 500,000 copies of the album.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that the album &quot;tells a coherent, largely autobiographical story about a girl getting even with the obnoxious people who piss her off and underestimate her... With music ranging from laid-back Liz Phair-style storytelling to hard-edge alternative arena rock, she blasts ex-boyfriends (&#x27;Navy Bean&#x27;, &#x27;The One&#x27;), ridicules rock stars (&#x27;Kisses&#x27;) and makes a pre-emptive strike at critics who might be tempted to label her (&#x27;One Hit Wonder&#x27;).&quot;

<doc id="1117266" wikidata="Q7737587" url="?curid=1117266" title="The Grave (1996 film)">
<text>The Grave is a 1996 thriller starring Craig Sheffer, Gabrielle Anwar and Josh Charles, the first project written by twin brothers Jonas Pate and Josh Pate, and directed by Jonas Pate. It notably features supporting performances by character actors Donal Logue, Max Perlich, Anthony Michael Hall, and Eric Roberts, along with an early appearance by Giovanni Ribisi.

==Plot==

An unseen figure in a jail cell with a raspy voice tells a story to another undetermined occupant in the cell.

Two years previous, brothers King and Tyn are serving a 20 year sentence in a Southern prison for joyriding in a stolen car. The brothers are told by a fellow inmate, Wex, about a local legend of a large undetermined fortune hidden in the grave of Masterson, a legendary local millionaire. King barters with one of the crooked officers in the prison, J.C. Cole, to allow them to escape in exchange for a share of the fortune. While not a clean getaway, the brothers successfully break out of the jail.

While on the run, during an attempt to steal civilian clothes from a laundry line, Tyn is shot by the homeowner. The brothers are able to get help from a stranger who allows them to take his truck, so he can report it stolen and collect the insurance. However, fearing recapture if they go to a proper hospital, they reluctantly visit an estranged friend, mortician Travis Purcell, who was responsible for sending them to jail, to tend to the wound. King alludes to being able to repay Travis for the favor, and leaves Tyn in his care. King then visits his ex-girlfriend Jordan, who is not happy to see him but goes to bed with him and lets him stay the night. J.C. spies on the couple during their night together. King promises to cut Jordan in on his payday, but she doubts anything will come of his claim.

Travis determines that Tyn&#x27;s wound is mortal, and threatens to not take him to a hospital unless he yields everything he knows about the grave. Tyn gives up his information, but dies anyway. With his slow-witted accomplices Cletus and Boo, the three go to dig up the grave themselves. They open the grave, and find only Masterson&#x27;s decayed corpse, with a pair of rings on its fingers. Travis takes one figuring it must have some worth. Boo hears someone coming near the grave, and knocks him unconscious with a shovel; it turns out to be King, coming to himself dig up the grave. In the panic of assaulting their friend, Travis ostensibly takes King&#x27;s pulse and determines he is dead, and puts him in Masterson&#x27;s grave. Boo is sent to go to town and lose King&#x27;s truck, but J.C. ambushes Boo and strangles him to unconsciousness. The next morning, J.C. weights down Boo&#x27;s legs, and throws him in a creek, which wakes him. J.C. gives him the choice of drowning, telling him who told him about the grave, or using a knife to sever his limbs. After initially trying the third option, Boo reveals Travis and Cletus&#x27; involvement, but drowns anyway.

Travis and Cletus go to an antique shop run by Jordan, asking her to interpret markings on Masterson&#x27;s ring. She tells them that urban legend was that Masterson as an elderly man had married a very young woman, Ophelia, hoping for an heir, but found she was infertile, and that they bought a child to raise instead, who was never heard from after both their deaths. She also reveals that the ring is worthless without its companion ring, inspiring the men to return to the grave to dig it out. When they unearth Masterson&#x27;s coffin again, King is miraculously still alive, albeit woozy. They retrieve the second ring and save him, but he quickly determines it was Travis who left him for dead. When they revisit Jordan, she is able to identify a Latin message viewable only when the rings are interlocked, but only offers it after King promises her a share of the fortune. It is deduced that whatever fortune Masterson hid is in Ophelia&#x27;s grave.

The men lift the stone cover from Ophelia&#x27;s grave, and find a ladder to an underground tunnel. The follow it to an iron door, and upon opening it, find a vault that contains both the dismembered remains of Ophelia, indicating Masterson killed her, and large amounts of cash and jewelry, the fortune she married him for. In their celebratory mania, someone locks the vault door, trapping them inside. Jordan emerges from Ophelia&#x27;s grave as the party responsible for locking them in. She is confronted by J.C., who reveals his intention to kill her. He shoots her and she falls to the ground, and as he steps to her to make sure she is dead, discovers he only shot her in the throat, and she in turn takes a hidden shotgun and kills him.

Returning to the cell, the storyteller is revealed to be Jordan, now using an artificial larynx to speak, explaining her altered voice, and the other person in the room is a priest. She reveals that since J.C. was a cop, she was doomed to be sentenced to death for killing him. When the priest asks what happened to Masterson&#x27;s changeling, she offers no conclusive answer but hints that it was her. Jordan is escorted to the electric chair and executed at dawn.

Some time later, the priest visits the cemetery, and opens Ophelia&#x27;s grave.

==Release==
&quot;The Grave&quot; did not receive a theatrical release, but instead was given a world premiere on HBO, and was later released on VHS by Republic Pictures. In 2021, it received its first-ever Blu-Ray release from Vinegar Syndrome, featuring commentary by director Jonas Pate and an interview with Keith David.

<text>Byron Schammer (born 21 June 1985) is an Australian rules footballer currently playing with the Claremont Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). He previously played with the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League.

==Early life==

Schammer rose to prominence in 2002 by winning the prestigious Larke Medal for the best player at the AFL Under 18 Championships. He also captained Australia in an under 17s International Rules Test against Ireland.

==AFL career==

He was taken by Fremantle later that year with the club&#x27;s first selection (no. 13 overall) in the National Draft. Playing 17 games in his debut season, including the club&#x27;s historic first final against Essendon, he quickly announced himself to be a player of the future, and earned a nomination for the Rising Star award. He backed it up with a strong 2004 season that saw him poll 12 Brownlow Medal votes, despite suffering a shoulder injury mid-year. Having moved into a defensive role in 2006, he played in 24 of Fremantle&#x27;s 25 games in 2006, before he was missed the first half of the 2007 season due to suffering a burst appendix and a subsequent bowel blockage during his recovery period.

He only missed one game in 2008 and in 2009, during the most consistent season of his career, he signed a two-year contract extension. However Schammer struggled to maintain his place in the Fremantle side in 2010 and 2011, playing only three games in 2010 and two in 2011, despite playing well for Claremont in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). In August 2011, the week after playing his first AFL game for the season, Schammer announced his retirement from the AFL. He will continue to play in the WAFL and will focus on his work as a stockbroker.

<doc id="1117270" wikidata="Q1315675" url="?curid=1117270" title="White Book of Rhydderch">
<text>The White Book of Rhydderch (Welsh: &quot;Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch&quot;, National Library of Wales, Peniarth MS 4-5) is one of the most notable and celebrated surviving manuscripts in Welsh. Mostly written in southwest Wales in the middle of the 14th century (c. 1350) it is the earliest collection of Welsh prose texts, though it also contains some examples of early Welsh poetry. It is now part of the collection of the National Library of Wales, having been preserved in the library at Hengwrt, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd, of the 17th century antiquary Robert Vaughan, who inherited it from the calligrapher John Jones and passed it to his descendants. The collection later passed to the newly established National Library of Wales as the Peniarth or Hengwrt-Peniarth Manuscripts.

What was one manuscript was divided into two in the medieval period and has been bound as two separate volumes, known as Peniarth MS 4 and Peniarth MS 5. Peniarth MS 4 contains the most important material: medieval Welsh tales now collectively known as the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. Peniarth MS 5 (the first part of the original manuscript) contains Christian religious texts in Welsh, mostly translated from Latin and French, including Lives of various saints and a tale of Charlemagne.

The White Book was copied in the mid 14th century, most probably for Rhydderch ab Ieuan Llwyd (c. 1325–1400) from Parcrhydderch in the parish of Llangeitho in Ceredigion. Rhydderch, who came from a family with a long tradition of literary patronage, held posts under the English Crown but was also an authority on native Welsh law. The hands of five scribes have been identified in the manuscripts, very likely working in Strata Florida Abbey, not far from Rhydderch&#x27;s home, and certainly in South Wales based on the dialect used by the scribes. The remainder of the name refers to the book being bound in white.

The contents of the manuscript are very similar to the Red Book of Hergest, and may have been its exemplar; but it is more likely that the two descend from a lost common ancestor. The White Book is no longer complete, but it was copied in 1573 by Richard Langford, before some of the text was lost. Langford&#x27;s copy is itself now lost, but two copies descending from it do survive: Peniarth 111 (made by John Jones of Gellillyfdy in 1607), whose spelling is very close to the White Book&#x27;s, and London, British Library, Add. MS 31055 (made by Thomas Wiliems in 1596, from a lost intermediary copy made in 1596 by Roger Maurice).

<text>Clissold Park is an open space in Stoke Newington, in the London Borough of Hackney. It is bounded by Greenway Close (to the north), Church Street (south), Green Lanes (west) and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Walk (east); the south-east corner abuts St Mary&#x27;s Old Church, now an arts venue. The park is 22.57 hectares (55.8 acres) in extent. The main building within its boundaries is the Grade II listed Clissold House, run as a cafe and events venue.

The park&#x27;s facilities include children&#x27;s playgrounds, sports fields, a bowling green, a skatepark bowl, tennis courts, and a paddling pool. Other attractions include an aviary with assorted captive species, an enclosure of deer and goats, a butterfly dome, and two small lakes hosting wild ducks, geese, swans and other water birds. The park also comprises a short section of the New River, and the Capital Ring has some of its paths running through the park.

Clissold Park received a Green Flag award in July 2008, and was substantially restored soon afterwards.

==History==

Clissold House (formerly Paradise House) was built, in the latter half of the 18th century, for Jonathan Hoare, a City of London merchant, Quaker, philanthropist and anti-slavery campaigner. (His brother, Samuel, half-brother of Sir Joseph Hoare Bt, was one of the founders of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade.) The park was created to be his idyll, and the stretch of water which wends its way around the house was part of the New River, an artificial waterway that supplied the capital with clean water from Hertfordshire.

Hoare, in financial difficulties, mortgaged the estate, and then lost it by foreclosure to a Robert Pryor. It was sold by Pryor&#x27;s executors to Thomas Gudgeon, a merchant, who owned it around the beginning of the 19th century. Gudgeon sold it in 1811 to William Crawshay I.

Subsequently, the estate passed, through a Crawshay family connection, to Augustus Clissold. When he died in 1882 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners bought the property, intending to profit from development. However, John Runtz and Joseph Beck persuaded the Metropolitan Board of Works to purchase it in 1887, to open it as a public park. The two lakes were named Beckmere and Runtzmere in their honour.

== Restoration ==

Clissold House is a Grade II listed building; it houses a cafe and serves as an event location. In 2007, Clissold Park was voted the &quot;Heart of Hackney&quot;, in a poll organised by the council. On 30 March 2007 the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) announced the award of a development grant to put forward a bid for a full £4.5 million Park Restoration Grant to restore the park and house to its original 18th-century design. The subsequent bid was successful, and in addition to funds from the HLF and the council, the project also received funding from the Big Lottery Fund. Work commenced in January 2010, and over the next two years an estimated £8.9 million was spent upgrading the house and its surrounding parkland.
Plans included:
* Restoring Clissold House
* Restoring a section of the New River
* Extensive maintenance to the two small lakes
* Renovating the animal enclosures
* Creating a new play and wheels park area.

Clissold House was added to the English Heritage &#x27;Heritage at Risk Register&#x27; in 1991 but removed in 2012 following the completion of the restoration programme.

==Access==
Arsenal, Finsbury Park and Manor House on the Piccadilly line are all within a mile of the park, as well as Stoke Newington Overground station. Buses 141, 341 and 393 stop on Green Lanes adjacent to the park.

==In popular culture==

<doc id="1117273" wikidata="Q5302821" url="?curid=1117273" title="Down Here">
<text>Down Here is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Tracy Bonham, released on April 18, 2000, through Island Records. The album was recorded between March 1998 and December 1999 by Bonham and producers Mitchell Froom, Tchad Blake, Mark Endert and Don Gilmore. The album was supposed to be released in October 1998 under the title &quot;Trail of a Dust Devil&quot;, but was delayed until the spring of 2000, as Island was going through a major restructuring.

&quot;Down Here&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. However, the album struggled to find an audience in a musical climate dominated by nu metal, and it experienced virtually no radio airplay. The album and its only single, &quot;Behind Every Good Woman&quot; failed to appear on any sales charts worldwide. &quot;Down Here&quot; was Bonham&#x27;s final album for Island.
== Background and recording ==

In 1996, Tracy Bonham released her gold-selling debut album &quot;The Burdens of Being Upright&quot;. Following several tours in support of the album, Bonham began recording a follow-up to the album in March 1998, at the Magic Shop in New York City with producers Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake. Bonham said that she chose to work with them &quot;for their credibility and for the way they make records &#x27;sound.&#x27; &quot; The recording sessions with Froom and Blake, which were completed by May 1998, were worked on with the assistance of bassist Sebastian Steinberg and drummers Pete Thomas and Steve Slingeneyer. After recording concluded, Bonham embarked on a warm-up tour for the album—then known as &quot;Trail of a Dust Devil&quot;—and in anticipation of its planned October 1998 release. 

Bonham&#x27;s record label, Island Records, was anxious about her working with Froom and Blake as both of them &quot;were not known as hitmakers&quot;. Although the label did not interfere with its recording (due to Froom&#x27;s refusal to allow any of its personnel into the studio), they were able to pressure Bonham into writing more commercial songs for the album. As she was writing potential hit singles, Island&#x27;s parent company PolyGram was merged into Universal Music Group, resulting in the label&#x27;s consolidation into the Island Def Jam Music Group. The merger led to the album being delayed into 1999. Frustrated, Bonham relocated from Boston to New York City, where she wrote &quot;Behind Every Good Woman&quot;. She would record the song, along with &quot;Freed&quot;, in early 1999 with producer Mark Endert, who engineered Fiona Apple&#x27;s debut album &quot;Tidal&quot; (1996), in order to &quot;get new life into what I was doing&quot;. Island responded enthusiastically to &quot;Behind Every Good Woman&quot;; according to Bonham, &quot;When I played them [the song], they were high-fiving each other and saying, &#x27;This is it, this is the anthem. Thank you for giving us this one—now we finally have the record we need&quot;. 

Amidst further corporate shakeups which saw most of the people she worked with at the label leave, Island Records&#x27; new management requested that Bonham write a &quot;second single&quot;—in between an already selected &quot;first&quot; and &quot;third&quot;—for the album. In December 1999, she recorded &quot;Fake It&quot; with producer Don Gilmore at Scream Studios in Los Angeles, after which the album was delayed—for a final time—to the spring of 2000. Bonham was ultimately able to keep nine of the songs she recorded with Froom and Blake on the final album, whilst cutting its track list down from fifteen to twelve songs by removing &quot;love ballads&quot; that she said were written about Slingeneyer, her fiancé at the time. Prior to its release, Bonham would also change the album&#x27;s title to &quot;Down Here&quot;, although some promotional copies bear its original title. Bonham said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to sound too bitter. The first title was my concept of the music business, like a dust devil sweeping through a deserted land. When I thought about that, I decided I didn&#x27;t want to go there.&quot;

==Reception==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: &quot;Though it occasionally sounds a little out of time -- it&#x27;s a record that would have made more sense in 1997 than in 2000 -- &quot;Down Here&quot; is a record that reveals much of its strengths only with repeated listens, and that&#x27;s part of the problem. Apart from the hardcore fans that have stuck with her for five years, not many people will give it a chance. If they do, they&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s a smart, assured, and distinctive second effort that is a quantum leap past her debut.&quot; &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; wrote that the &quot;trouble is perhaps, that for all Bonham&#x27;s musical craftiness (and her violin-playing which saws through a few tracks) and attitude, she&#x27;s not that memorable, especially melodically.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; thought that the album &quot;collects music that is even richer and more distinctive&quot; than the debut.

<text>Imidazole (ImH) is an organic compound with the formula . It is a white or colourless solid that is soluble in water, producing a mildly alkaline solution. It can be classified as a heterocycle, specifically as a diazole.

Many natural products, especially alkaloids, contain the imidazole ring. These imidazoles share the 1,3-C3N2 ring but feature varied substituents. This ring system is present in important biological building blocks, such as histidine and the related hormone histamine. Many drugs contain an imidazole ring, such as certain antifungal drugs, the nitroimidazole series of antibiotics, and the sedative midazolam.

When fused to a pyrimidine ring, it forms a purine, which is the most widely occurring nitrogen-containing heterocycle in nature.

The name &quot;imidazole&quot; was coined in 1887 by the German chemist Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch (1857–1935).

==Structure and properties==
Imidazole is a planar 5-membered ring, that exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms because hydrogen can be bound to one or another nitrogen atom. Imidazole is a highly polar compound, as evidenced by its electric dipole moment of 3.67 D, and is highly soluble in water. The compound is classified as aromatic due to the presence of a planar ring containing 6 π-electrons (a pair of electrons from the protonated nitrogen atom and one from each of the remaining four atoms of the ring). Some resonance structures of imidazole are shown below:


===Amphoterism===
Imidazole is amphoteric, which is to say that it can function both as an acid and as a base. As an acid, the p&quot;K&quot;a of imidazole is 14.5, making it less acidic than carboxylic acids, phenols, and imides, but slightly more acidic than alcohols. The acidic proton is the one bound to nitrogen. Deprotonation gives the imidazolide anion, which is symmetrical. As a base, the p&quot;K&quot;a of the conjugate acid (cited as p&quot;K&quot;BH+ to avoid confusion between the two) is approximately 7, making imidazole approximately sixty times more basic than pyridine. The basic site is the nitrogen with the lone pair (and not bound to hydrogen). Protonation gives the imidazolium cation, which is symmetrical.

==Preparation==
Imidazole was first reported in 1858 by the German chemist Heinrich Debus, although various imidazole derivatives had been discovered as early as the 1840s. It was shown that glyoxal, formaldehyde, and ammonia condense to form imidazole (glyoxaline, as it was originally named). This synthesis, while producing relatively low yields, is still used for generating &quot;C&quot;-substituted imidazoles.
In one microwave modification, the reactants are benzil, benzaldehyde and ammonia in glacial acetic acid, forming 2,4,5-triphenylimidazole (&quot;lophine&quot;).

Imidazole can be synthesized by numerous methods besides the Debus method. Many of these syntheses can also be applied to different substituted imidazoles and imidazole derivatives by varying the functional groups on the reactants. These methods are commonly categorized by which and how many bonds form to make the imidazole rings. For example, the Debus method forms the (1,2), (3,4), and (1,5) bonds in imidazole, using each reactant as a fragment of the ring, and thus this method would be a three-bond-forming synthesis. A small sampling of these methods is presented below.

===Formation of one bond===
The (1,5) or (3,4) bond can be formed by the reaction of an imidate and an α-aminoaldehyde or α-aminoacetal. The example below applies to imidazole when R1 = R2 = hydrogen.

===Formation of two bonds===
The (1,2) and (2,3) bonds can be formed by treating a 1,2-diaminoalkane, at high temperatures, with an alcohol, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. A dehydrogenating catalyst, such as platinum on alumina, is required.
The (1,2) and (3,4) bonds can also be formed from &quot;N&quot;-substituted α-aminoketones and formamide with heat. The product will be a 1,4-disubstituted imidazole, but here since R1 = R2 = hydrogen, imidazole itself is the product. The yield of this reaction is moderate, but it seems to be the most effective method of making the 1,4 substitution.

===Formation of four bonds===
This is a general method that is able to give good yields for substituted imidazoles. In essence, it is an adaptation of the Debus method called the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis. The starting materials are substituted glyoxal, aldehyde, amine, and ammonia or an ammonium salt.

===Formation from other heterocycles===
Imidazole can be synthesized by the photolysis of 1-vinyltetrazole. This reaction will give substantial yields only if the 1-vinyltetrazole is made efficiently from an organotin compound, such as 2-tributylstannyltetrazole. The reaction, shown below, produces imidazole when R1 = R2 = R3 = hydrogen.
Imidazole can also be formed in a vapor-phase reaction. The reaction occurs with formamide, ethylenediamine, and hydrogen over platinum on alumina, and it must take place between 340 and 480 °C. This forms a very pure imidazole product.

The Van Leusen reaction can also be employed to form imidazoles starting from TosMIC and an aldimine. The Van Leusen Imidazole Synthesis allows the preparation of imidazoles from aldimines by reaction with tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC). The reaction has later been expanded to a two-step synthesis in which the aldimine is generated in situ: the Van Leusen Three-Component Reaction (vL-3CR).

==Biological significance and applications==
Imidazole is incorporated into many important biological compounds. The most pervasive is the amino acid histidine, which has an imidazole side-chain. Histidine is present in many proteins and enzymes, e.g. by binding metal cofactors, as seen in hemoglobin.

Imidazole-based histidine compounds play an important role in intracellular buffering. Histidine can be decarboxylated to histamine. Histamine can cause urticaria (hives) when it is produced during allergic reaction.

===Pharmaceutical derivatives===
Imidazole substituents are found in many pharmaceuticals such as anticancer drug mercaptopurine. The imidazole group is present in many fungicides and antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antihypertensive medications. Imidazole is part of the theophylline molecule, found in tea leaves and coffee beans, that stimulates the central nervous system.

A number of substituted imidazoles, including clotrimazole, are selective inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase. Other biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the downregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with translation initiation.

The substituted imidazole derivatives are valuable in treatment of many systemic fungal infections. Imidazoles belong to the class of azole antifungals, which includes ketoconazole, miconazole, and clotrimazole.

For comparison, another group of azoles is the triazoles, which includes fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. The difference between the imidazoles and the triazoles involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the triazoles bind to the heme group. The triazoles have been shown to have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles.

Some imidazole derivatives show effects on insects, for example sulconazole nitrate exhibits a strong anti-feeding effect on the keratin-digesting Australian carpet beetle larvae &quot;Anthrenocerus australis&quot;, as does econazole nitrate with the common clothes moth &quot;Tineola bisselliella&quot;.

==Industrial applications==
Imidazole itself has few direct applications. It is instead a precursor to a variety of agrichemicals, including enilconazole, climbazole, clotrimazole, prochloraz, and bifonazole.
==Depolymerizing PET via Imidazolysis==
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used plastic found in clothing, food packaging, beverage bottles, and thermoplastic resins. The massive accumulation of PET waste, mostly from single-use beverage bottles and food packaging, creates serious environmental problems. As a type of polyester, PET can be broken down through a process called depolymerization which involves breaking its molecular chains using chemical methods.

A method of depolymerization called &quot;imidazolysis,&quot; uses imidazole and similar compounds to break down PET. When PET reacts with an excess of imidazole, it produces 1,1′-terephthaloylbisimidazole (TBI). TBI can be further processed into smaller products, including amides, benzimidazoles, and esters, or even reused to create new polymers. TBI is a flexible intermediate compound, meaning it can be stored and later transformed into specific products as needed. This may allow manufacturers to delay deciding on the final products until after the depolymerization process, providing flexibility to meet different industrial demands.

Imidazolysis can also be used to break down other polyesters and polyurethanes, making it a versatile approach for recycling plastics.

==Coordination chemistry==

Imidazole and its derivatives have high affinity for metal cations. One of the applications of imidazole is in the purification of His-tagged proteins in immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Imidazole is used to elute tagged proteins bound to nickel ions attached to the surface of beads in the chromatography column. An excess of imidazole is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel coordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins.

==Use in biological research==
Imidazole is a suitable buffer for pH 6.2 to 7.8. Pure imidazole has essentially no absorbance at protein relevant wavelengths (280 nm), however lower purities of imidazole can give notable absorbance at 280 nm. Imidazole can interfere with the Lowry protein assay.

Imidazole is often used in protein purification, where recombinant proteins with polyhistidine tags are immobilized onto nickel resins and eluted with a high imidazole concentration.

==Salts of imidazole==

Salts of imidazole where the imidazole ring is the cation are known as imidazolium salts (for example, imidazolium chloride or nitrate). These salts are formed from the protonation or substitution at nitrogen of imidazole. These salts have been used as ionic liquids and precursors to stable carbenes. Salts where a deprotonated imidazole is an anion are also well known; these salts are known as imidazolates (for example, sodium imidazolate, NaC3H3N2).

<doc id="1117290" wikidata="Q898579" url="?curid=1117290" title="Ionic liquid">
<text>An ionic liquid (IL) is a salt in the liquid state at ambient conditions. In some contexts, the term has been restricted to salts whose melting point is below a specific temperature, such as . While ordinary liquids such as water and gasoline are predominantly made of electrically neutral molecules, ionic liquids are largely made of ions. These substances are variously called liquid electrolytes, ionic melts, ionic fluids, fused salts, liquid salts, or ionic glasses.

Ionic liquids have many potential applications. They are powerful solvents and can be used as electrolytes. Salts that are liquid at near-ambient temperature are important for electric battery applications, and have been considered as sealants due to their very low vapor pressure.

Any salt that melts without decomposing or vaporizing usually yields an ionic liquid. Sodium chloride (NaCl), for example, melts at into a liquid that consists largely of sodium cations () and chloride anions (). Conversely, when an ionic liquid is cooled, it often forms an ionic solid—which may be either crystalline or glassy.

The ionic bond is usually stronger than the Van der Waals forces between the molecules of ordinary liquids. Because of these strong interactions, salts tend to have high lattice energies, manifested in high melting points. Some salts, especially those with organic cations, have low lattice energies and thus are liquid at or below room temperature. Examples include compounds based on the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM) cation and include: EMIM:Cl, EMIMAc (acetate anion), EMIM dicyanamide, ()()·, that melts at ; and 1-butyl-3,5-dimethylpyridinium bromide which becomes a glass below .

Low-temperature ionic liquids can be compared to ionic solutions, liquids that contain both ions and neutral molecules, and in particular to the so-called deep eutectic solvents, mixtures of ionic and non-ionic solid substances which have much lower melting points than the pure compounds. Certain mixtures of nitrate salts can have melting points below 100 °C.

==History==
The term &quot;ionic liquid&quot; in the general sense was used as early as 1943.

The discovery date of the &quot;first&quot; ionic liquid is disputed, along with the identity of its discoverer. Ethanolammonium nitrate (m.p. 52–55 °C) was reported in 1888 by S. Gabriel and J. Weiner. In 1911 Ray and Rakshit, during preparation of the nitrite salts of ethylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine observed that the reaction between ethylamine hydrochloride and silver nitrate yielded an unstable ethylammonium nitrite ()· , a heavy yellow liquid which on immersion in a mixture of salt and ice could not be solidified and was probably the first report of room-temperature ionic liquid. Later in 1914, Paul Walden reported one of the first stable room-temperature ionic liquids ethylammonium nitrate ()· (m.p. 12 °C). In the 1970s and 1980s, ionic liquids based on alkyl-substituted imidazolium and pyridinium cations, with halide or tetrahalogenoaluminate anions, were developed as potential electrolytes in batteries.

For the imidazolium halogenoaluminate salts, their physical properties—such as viscosity, melting point, and acidity—could be adjusted by changing the alkyl substituents and the imidazolium/pyridinium and halide/halogenoaluminate ratios. Two major drawbacks for some applications were moisture sensitivity and acidity or basicity. In 1992, Wilkes and Zawarotko obtained ionic liquids with &#x27;neutral&#x27; weakly coordinating anions such as hexafluorophosphate () and tetrafluoroborate (), allowing a much wider range of applications.

==Characteristics==
ILs are typically colorless viscous liquids. They are often moderate to poor conductors of electricity, and rarely self-ionize. They do, however, have a very large electrochemical window, enabling electrochemical refinement of otherwise intractable ores.

They exhibit low vapor pressure, which can be as low as 10−10 Pa. Many have low combustibility and are thermally stable.

The solubility properties of ILs are diverse. Saturated aliphatic compounds are generally only sparingly soluble in ionic liquids, whereas alkenes show somewhat greater solubility, and aldehydes often completely miscible. Solubility differences can be exploited in biphasic catalysis, such as hydrogenation and hydrocarbonylation processes, allowing for relatively easy separation of products and/or unreacted substrate(s). Gas solubility follows the same trend, with carbon dioxide gas showing good solubility in many ionic liquids. Carbon monoxide is less soluble in ionic liquids than in many popular organic solvents, and hydrogen is only slightly soluble (similar to the solubility in water) and may vary relatively little between the more common ionic liquids.
Many classes of chemical reactions, The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids have been investigated for many applications.

Some ionic liquids can be distilled under vacuum conditions at temperatures near 300 °C. The vapor is not made up of separated ions, but consists of ion pairs.

ILs have a wide liquid range. Some ILs do not freeze down to very low temperatures (even −150 °C), The glass transition temperature was detected below −100 °C in the case of N-methyl-N-alkylpyrrolidinium cations fluorosulfonyl-trifluoromethanesulfonylimide (FTFSI). Low-temperature ionic liquids (below 130 K) have been proposed as the fluid base for an extremely large diameter spinning liquid-mirror telescope to be based on the Moon.

Water is a common impurity in ionic liquids, as it can be absorbed from the atmosphere and influences the transport properties of RTILs, even at relatively low concentrations.

==Varieties==

Classically, ILs consist of salts of unsymmetrical, flexible organic cations with symmetrical weakly coordinating anions. Both cationic and anionic components have been widely varied.

===Cations===
Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are dominated by salts derived from 1-methylimidazole, i.e., 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium. Examples include 1-ethyl-3-methyl- (EMIM), 1-butyl-3-methyl- (BMIM), 1-octyl-3 methyl (OMIM), 1-decyl-3-methyl-(DMIM), 1-dodecyl-3-methyl- (dodecylMIM). Other imidazolium cations are 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium (BMMIM or DBMIM) and 1,3-di(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-2-methylimidazolium (DAMI). Other N-heterocyclic cations are derived from pyridine: 4-methyl-N-butyl-pyridinium (MBPy) and N-octylpyridinium (C8Py). Conventional quaternary ammonium cations also form ILs, e.g. tetraethylammonium (TEA) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA).

===Anions===
Typical anions in ionic liquids include the following: tetrafluoroborate (BF4), hexafluorophosphate (PF6), bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide (NTf2), trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTf), dicyanamide (N(CN)2), hydrogensulfate (), and ethyl sulfate (EtOSO3). Magnetic ionic liquids can be synthesized by incorporating paramagnetic anions, illustrated by 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate.

====Specialized ILs====
Protic ionic liquids are formed via a proton transfer from an acid to a base. In contrast to other ionic liquids, which generally are formed through a sequence of synthesis steps, protic ionic liquids can be created more easily by simply mixing the acid and base.

Phosphonium cations (R4P+) are less common but offer some advantageous properties. Some examples of phosphonium cations are trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium (P6,6,6,14) and tributyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium (P4,4,4,14).

===Poly(ionic liquid)s===
Polymerized ionic liquids, poly(ionic liquid)s or polymeric ionic liquids, all abbreviated as PIL is the polymeric form of ionic liquids. They have half of the ionicity of ionic liquids since one ion is fixed as the polymer moiety to form a polymeric chain. PILs have a similar range of applications, comparable with those of ionic liquids but the polymer architecture provides a better chance for controlling the ionic conductivity. They have extended the applications of ionic liquids for designing smart materials or solid electrolytes.

==Commercial applications==
Many applications have been considered, but few have been commercialized. ILs are used in the production of gasoline by catalyzing alkylation.
An IL based on tetraalkylphosphonium iodide is a solvent for tributyltin iodide, which functions as a catalyst to rearrange the monoepoxide of butadiene. This process was commercialized as a route to 2,5-dihydrofuran, but later discontinued.

==Potential applications==

===Catalysis===
ILs improve the catalytic performance of palladium nanoparticles. Furthermore, ionic liquids can be used as pre-catalysts for chemical transformations. In this regard dialkylimidazoliums such as [EMIM]Ac have been used in the combination with a base to generate N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). These imidazolium based NHCs are known to catalyse a number transformations such as the benzoin condensation and the OTHO reaction.

===Pharmaceuticals===
Recognizing that approximately 50% of commercial pharmaceuticals are salts, ionic liquid forms of a number of pharmaceuticals have been investigated. Combining a pharmaceutically active cation with a pharmaceutically active anion leads to a Dual Active ionic liquid in which the actions of two drugs are combined.

ILs can extract specific compounds from plants for pharmaceutical, nutritional and cosmetic applications, such as the antimalarial drug artemisinin from the plant &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;.

===Biopolymer processing===
The dissolution of cellulose by ILs has attracted interest. A patent application from 1930 showed that 1-alkylpyridinium chlorides dissolve cellulose. Following in the footsteps of the lyocell process, which uses hydrated N-methylmorpholine N-oxide as a solvent for pulp and paper. The &quot;valorization&quot; of cellulose, i.e. its conversion to more valuable chemicals, has been achieved by the use of ionic liquids. Representative products are glucose esters, sorbitol, and alkylgycosides. IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride dissolves freeze-dried banana pulp and with an additional 15% dimethyl sulfoxide, lends itself to carbon-13 NMR analysis. In this way the entire complex of starch, sucrose, glucose, and fructose can be monitored as a function of banana ripening.

Beyond cellulose, ILs have also shown potential in the dissolution, extraction, purification, processing and modification of other biopolymers such as chitin/chitosan, starch, alginate, collagen, gelatin, keratin, and fibroin. For example, ILs allow for the preparation of biopolymer materials in different forms (e.g. sponges, films, microparticles, nanoparticles, and aerogels) and better biopolymer chemical reactions, leading to biopolymer-based drug/gene-delivery carriers. Moreover, ILs enable the synthesis of chemically modified starches with high efficiency and degrees of substitution (DS) and the development of various starch-based materials such as thermoplastic starch, composite films, solid polymer electrolytes, nanoparticles and drug carriers.

===Nuclear fuel reprocessing===
The IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride has been investigated for the recovery of uranium and other metals from spent nuclear fuel and other sources.

===Solar thermal energy===
ILs are potential heat transfer and storage media in solar thermal energy systems. Concentrating solar thermal facilities such as parabolic troughs and solar power towers focus the sun&#x27;s energy onto a receiver, which can generate temperatures of around . This heat can then generate electricity in a steam or other cycle. For buffering during cloudy periods or to enable generation overnight, energy can be stored by heating an intermediate fluid. Although nitrate salts have been the medium of choice since the early 1980s, they freeze at and thus require heating to prevent solidification. Ionic liquids such as [C4mim][] have more favorable liquid-phase temperature ranges (-75 to 459 °C) and could therefore be excellent liquid thermal storage media and heat transfer fluids.

===Waste recycling===
ILs can aid the recycling of synthetic goods, plastics, and metals. They offer the specificity required to separate similar compounds from each other, such as separating polymers in plastic waste streams. This has been achieved using lower temperature extraction processes than current approaches and could help avoid incinerating plastics or dumping them in landfill.

===Batteries===
ILs can replace water as the electrolyte in metal-air batteries. ILs are attractive because of their low vapor pressure. Furthermore, ILs have an electrochemical window of up to six volts (versus 1.23 for water) supporting more energy-dense metals. Energy densities from 900 to 1600 watt-hours per kilogram appear possible.

===Dispersing agent===
ILs can act as dispersing agents in paints to enhance finish, appearance, and drying properties. ILs are used for dispersing nanomaterials at IOLITEC.

===Carbon capture===

ILs and amines have been investigated for capturing carbon dioxide and purifying natural gas.

===Tribology===
Some ionic liquids have been shown to reduce friction and wear in basic tribological testing, and their polar nature makes them candidate lubricants for tribotronic applications. While the comparatively high cost of ionic liquids currently prevents their use as neat lubricants, adding ionic liquids in concentrations as low as 0.5 wt% may significantly alter the lubricating performance of conventional base oils. Thus, the current focus of research is on using ionic liquids as additives to lubricating oils, often with the motivation to replace widely used, ecologically harmful lubricant additives. However, the claimed ecological advantage of ionic liquids has been questioned repeatedly and is yet to be demonstrated from a life-cycle perspective.

==Safety==
Ionic liquids&#x27; low volatility effectively eliminates a major pathway for environmental release and contamination.

Ionic liquids&#x27; aquatic toxicity is as severe as or more so than many current solvents.

Ultrasound can degrade solutions of imidazolium-based ionic liquids with hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid to relatively innocuous compounds.

Despite low vapor pressure many ionic liquids are combustible.

<text>The is a supermini/subcompact car sold by Toyota since 1999, replacing the Starlet and Tercel.

Up to 2019, Toyota had used the Yaris nameplate on export versions of various Japanese-market models, with some markets receiving the same vehicles under the Toyota Echo name through 2005. Starting in 2020, the Yaris nameplate began to be used in Japan, which replaced the Vitz nameplate.

The Yaris nameplate has also been applied to other vehicles. From 1999 to 2005, the nameplate had been used for the Yaris Verso mini MPV sold in Europe, where it was known in Japan as the FunCargo. Since 2020, the nameplate has also been used for the subcompact crossover SUV offering called Yaris Cross. In North America, most Yaris sedan models sold from 2015 to 2020 and Yaris hatchbacks sold from 2019 until 2020 were restyled versions of the Mazda2, produced and developed by Mazda.

In 2020, Toyota introduced the GR Yaris, which is a three-door performance-oriented variant of the XP210 series Yaris using the Gazoo Racing branding. It is built as a homologation model for the FIA World Rally Championship.

The name &quot;Yaris&quot; is derived from &quot;Charis&quot;, the singular form of Charites, the Greek goddesses of charm and beauty. , the Yaris has sold 8.71 million units worldwide.


== Timeline ==
== First generation (XP10/XP20; 1999) ==
The first-generation models were marketed between 1999 and 2005 under the &quot;Yaris&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; names depending on the market. Hatchback, sedan and coupe body variants were offered. The hatchback version was developed with the European market as the main target, designed by Toyota’s ED2 facility in France. Exterior panels common between the hatchback and sedan versions are limited to the front doors.

* Hatchback: versions derive from the Japanese market Toyota Vitz (XP10).
* Sedan and coupe: versions derive from the Japanese market Toyota Platz (XP10).

== Second generation (XP90; 2005) ==
The second-generation models were marketed between 2005 and 2013 under the &quot;Yaris&quot; name worldwide. Hatchback and sedan body styles were offered. The hatchback version was discontinued in late 2013 for Asian markets.

* Hatchback: versions derive from the Japanese market Toyota Vitz (XP90).
* Sedan: versions derive from the Japanese market Toyota Belta (XP90).

== Third generation (XP130, 2011; XP150, 2013) ==
The third-generation models have been marketed since 2011 under the &quot;Yaris&quot; name worldwide. Originally available only as a hatchback, a sedan body style arrived in 2013, but it has not been offered in all countries; notably, the United States and Canada have received only restyled Mazda2 sedans, which have also been sold side-by-side with Toyota-produced sedans in Latin American and Caribbean markets.

* Hatchback: European, Australasian, South African and most North American versions derive from the Japanese market Toyota Vitz (XP130), introduced in early 2011. Most Asian versions from 2013, some Latin American and Caribbean models from 2014 and mostly from early 2018, and South African models from early 2018 derive from the Asian market Toyota Yaris (XP150).
* Sedan: Most Asian versions, Latin American and Caribbean models derive from the Asian market Toyota Vios (XP150), introduced in 2013. Some Asian versions from 2017 and most Latin American and Caribbean models from early 2018 derive from the Toyota Yaris (XP150).

=== United States and Canada ===
Starting with 2012 models introduced in late 2011, only the XP130 Yaris Liftback was sold in the United States, and the XP150 sedan model was not offered. Toyota simultaneously dropped the Yaris sedan in Canada due to lackluster sales of the XP90 sedan.

Production of all United States and Canadian XP130 Yaris models shifted from Japan to Toyota Motor Manufacturing France starting in May 2013.

The 2019 model year XP130 Yaris Liftback was never introduced in the United States; Toyota continued sales of the 2018 model into January 2019 when it was discontinued. Sales of the Canadian 2019 model continued into 2020 when it was replaced by the Mazda2-based Yaris.

=== Latin America, the Caribbean and Mexico ===
The XP150 series Vios was introduced in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2013 as the Yaris Sedan. In early 2018, a version of the Thai-market Yaris ATIV replaced the XP150 model in these markets, being marketed under the Yaris Sedan name. In Mexico, it was sold alongside the more expensive Mazda2-based Yaris R until 2020.

== Fourth generation (XP210, 2020; AC100, 2022) ==
The fourth-generation Yaris, available initially only as a hatchback, was unveiled simultaneously on 16 October 2019 in Japan and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Built on the GA-B platform, its development was led by chief engineer Yasunori Suezawa and chief hybrid engineer Takashi Uehara. It went on sale in Japan on 10 February 2020, while the petrol 4WD variant went on sale in April 2020.

A performance-oriented version developed by Toyota Gazoo Racing, called the GR Yaris, was first unveiled at the 2020 Tokyo Auto Salon and production began in September 2020.

The XP210 Yaris Hybrid-based Mazda2 Hybrid went on sale in Europe in 2022.

The North American market did not receive the fourth-generation Yaris. Additionally, the nameplate (which had been used for a restyled Mazda2) was eliminated in 2020.

The sedan version was introduced in August 2022, debuting in Thailand as the Yaris Ativ to replace the previous XP150 model. Designated AC100, the model was developed by Daihatsu using the company&#x27;s DNGA-B platform.

== Mazda2-based models (DA/DB/DD; 2015) ==
In 2014, Mazda began production of the Mazda2 in Salamanca, Guanajuato, for various North and South American markets. At the 2015 New York International Auto Show in April of that year, it was announced that this plant would produce a version of the Mazda2 for Toyota with minor styling changes, with the vehicle to be sold in Mexico as the Yaris, in the United States as the Scion iA, and in Canada as the Yaris sedan. In July 2015, Toyota confirmed that the car would be sold in Mexico as the Yaris R.

After the phase-out of the Scion marque in the United States, the car was renamed as the Toyota Yaris iA from August 2016 for the 2017 model year. For the 2019 model year, it was renamed again as the Yaris sedan in the United States, receiving a minor facelift with an updated grille insert and trim changes. Unlike the previous models, which offered only exterior colors and a choice between 6-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmissions as factory options, both the United States and Canadian 2019 and 2020 Yaris sedans were offered in L, LE and XLE trim levels with a wider variety of interior and exterior options.

A Mazda-built Yaris hatchback—a rebadged Mazda2 with a front fascia similar to that of the Yaris sedan—made its debut at the 2019 New York International Auto Show in April of that year and replaced the XP130 Yaris Liftback in the United States and Canada for the 2020 model year. Its official images were revealed on 1 April 2019. The United States and Canadian Yaris hatchback was offered in LE and XLE trim levels. In the United States, sales of the hatchback began in October 2019.

Both Mazda2-based Yaris models were discontinued in the U.S. in June 2020 due to new regulations and slow sales. In July, Toyota confirmed that sales were also ending in Canada. The vehicles were also discontinued in Mexico in August, leaving only the Thai-imported XP150 series Yaris and Yaris Sedán as its indirect replacements.

== Yaris Verso (1999) ==


The Yaris Verso is a mini MPV that shares the same NBC platform as the XP10 series Yaris/Vitz/Platz/Echo, which was produced between 1999 and 2005. It was succeeded by the Ractis/Verso-S.

== Yaris Cross ==
The Yaris Cross nameplate is used by two subcompact crossover SUVs. The first model was produced since 2020 for Japan, Europe and Australasia. Designated XP210, the model shares the same TNGA-B platform as the XP210 series Yaris. The second model was produced since 2023 for emerging markets such as Southeast Asia. Designated AC200, the model was developed by Daihatsu and shares the same DNGA-B platform as the AC100 series Vios/Yaris.

== Concept models ==
* Yaris Cabrio Concept (2000)
* Yaris Five Axis (2008)
* Yaris HSD Concept (2011)
* Yaris Hybrid-R (2013)
* Yaris Legian (2015)

<text>The Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) is an institution devoted to research on the public opinion of international politics. It is jointly run by the Center on Policy Attitudes and the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland at the School of Public Affairs, University of Maryland, College Park.

PIPA has investigated topics such as the public perceptions of United States international politics and of international organisations (NATO, the United Nations, and the International Monetary Fund). It maintains the &quot;Americans and the World&quot; website, described as a &quot;source of comprehensive information on US public opinion on international issues&quot;.

In January 2006, PIPA launched WorldPublicOpinion.org, a comprehensive website devoted to public opinion on international policy and affairs, stating that while &quot;Others report what the world does, we report what the world thinks.&quot;

Sponsors include the Rockefeller Foundation, Tides Foundation and the Ford Foundation.

<doc id="1117295" wikidata="Q1518802" url="?curid=1117295" title="Toyota Platz">
<text>The is a subcompact car that was manufactured in Japan by Toyota from 1999 until 2005, when it was replaced by the Belta. Designated by Toyota as the &quot;XP10&quot; series, the Platz was also sold in export markets as either the Toyota Yaris or Toyota Echo. The &quot;Yaris&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; names were also given to the export version of the related Japanese market Vitz hatchback, from which the Platz derives. In Japan, it was available at the &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; and the &quot;Netz Toyota Store&quot; dealerships.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Platz&quot; is German for &quot;space&quot; (as defined by &quot;the interior room is spacious&quot;). Only straight-four engines were fitted to the Platz, which was sold in Japan as a four-door sedan only. A coupé version was also available in North America where the car was badged &quot;Echo&quot;.

== History ==
The Platz was introduced in 1999 as a sedan sold internationally, with a coupé version exclusive to North America following for the 2000 model year. The Platz is closely related to the Vitz hatchback with which it shares front doors, a common interior and mechanical componentry. The running gear is also shared to a lesser degree with the ist and bB, sold in the United States as the Scion xA and xB respectively, and the JDM-only WiLL Vi. The same platform is the base for the JDM-only Probox and Succeed wagons.

In the United States, the Echo sold almost 50,000 units in its first year, with just half that many in 2003. The Echo was an element of Toyota Project Genesis, a failed effort to bring younger buyers to the marque in the United States. The Echo sold in high volumes in Canada, where Toyota also offered the three- and five-door hatchback versions of the Vitz badged as the Echo beginning with the 2004 model year to replace the Echo coupé (which was dropped after 2003). The coupé remained on sale in the United States until the 2005 model year along with the sedan, while the hatchback variants were never sold there. It was the predecessor to the current North American Yaris, sharing many identical features, such as the odd (and somewhat controversial) center placement of the speedometer and gauges, as opposed to in front of the steering wheel. Power options on the Echo are a rare find; most models are equipped with manual windows and locks, air conditioning, and a six-speaker audio system with a CD and/or a cassette player.

== Xiali 2000/Vela ==

In China, the Platz was marketed as the Xiali 2000 from December 2000 to March 2004. The car was then lightly facelifted and renamed as the Xiali Vela, which sold from March 2004 to 2012. It came with the 1.3-litre 8A-FE, 1.5-litre 5A-FE or a 1.6-litre Chinese-made engine known as the CA4GB2. A five-speed manual gearbox was standard on all models. From 2002 to 2003, a limited edition model was sold the Xiali Yaku and available with a 4-speed automatic gearbox.

== Safety ==
The 2010 edition of Monash University&#x27;s &quot;Used Car Safety Ratings&quot; (UCSR), found that the XP10 provides a &quot;poor&quot; (two out of five stars) level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.

<doc id="1117301" wikidata="Q223862" url="?curid=1117301" title="Haram">
<text>Haram (; ) is an Arabic term meaning &#x27;forbidden&#x27;. This may refer to either something sacred to which access is not allowed to the people who are not in a state of purity or who are not initiated into the sacred knowledge; or, in direct contrast, to an evil and thus &quot;sinful action that is forbidden to be done&quot;. The term also denotes something &quot;set aside&quot;, thus being the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew concept () and the concept of (cf. sacred) in Roman law and religion. In Islamic jurisprudence, &quot;haram&quot; is used to refer to any act that is forbidden by Allah and is one of the five Islamic commandments ( ) that define the morality of human action.

Acts that are haram are typically prohibited in the religious texts of the Quran and the category of haram is the highest status of prohibition. Something that is considered haram remains prohibited no matter how good the intention is or how honorable the purpose is. Sins, good, and meritorious acts are placed on the (weighing scales) on the Day of Judgement and are weighed according to the sincerity of the doer. Views of different or legal schools of thought can vary significantly regarding what is or is not haram based on the scholarly interpretation of the core religious texts (Quran and hadith).

==Overview==
Actions that are haram result in harm one way or another and are therefore considered a sin if carried out by a Muslim.

By bringing up the word &quot;benefit&quot; as an opposite to &quot;sin&quot;, verse 2:219 of the Quran clarifies that &quot;haram&quot; is that which is harmful, in opposition to that which brings benefit; therefore, sin is that which hurts others or oneself.

An Islamic principle related to haram is that if something is prohibited or forbidden, then anything that leads to it is also considered a haram act. A similar principle is that the sin of haram is not limited to the person who engages in the prohibited activity, but the sin also extends to others who support the person in the activity, whether it be material or moral support.

The five categories of or the hierarchy of acts from permitted to non-permitted are:

# – Compulsory, &quot;duty&quot;
# – Recommended, &quot;desirable&quot;
# – Neutral, &quot;permissible&quot;
# – Disliked, &quot;discouraged&quot;
# – Sinful, &quot;prohibited&quot;

The two types of haram are:

* – Prohibited because of its essence and harm it causes to an individual
** Adultery, murder, theft
* – Prohibited because of external reasons that are not fundamentally harmful but are associated to something that is prohibited
** Ill-gotten wealth obtained through sin. Examples include money earned through cheating, stealing, corruption, murder, and interest, or any means that involve harm to another human being. Also, a deal or sale during Friday&#x27;s prayers (). It is prohibited in Islam for a Muslim to profit from such haram actions. Any believer who benefits from or lives off wealth obtained through haram is a sinner.
** Prayer in a house, taken illegally.

The religious term &quot;haram&quot;, based on the Quran, is applied to:
* Actions, such as cursing, fornication, murder, and disrespecting one&#x27;s parents
* Policies, such as (usury, interest)
* Certain food and drinks, such as pork and alcohol.
* Some halal objects, foods, or actions that are normally halal (permissible) but under some conditions become haram. For example, halal food and drinks during the day in Ramadan or a cow or another halal animal that is not slaughtered in the Islamic way and in the name of Allah (God).
* Certain inaction, such as abandoning the without a valid reason.

== Culture ==
Linguistically, the root of the term &quot;haram&quot; (compare Ancient Hebrew , meaning &#x27;devoted to God&#x27;, &#x27;forbidden for profane use&#x27;) is used to form a wide range of other terms that have legal implications, such as (a harem) and (a state of purity). In addition, the same word (&quot;haram&quot;) is used in the Quran to denote the sacred nature of the Ka&#x27;ba and the areas of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. This category of sacred, holy, and inviolable also includes spouses and university campuses. As such, the legal use of the root is based on an idea of boundaries between the profane and the sacred, as opposed to prohibitions, as is normally assumed.

Colloquially, the word &quot;haram&quot; takes on different meanings and operates more closely as a dichotomy with &quot;halal&quot;, which denotes the permissible. In Arabic-speaking countries, saying &quot;haram&quot; can mean &#x27;what a shame&#x27; or &#x27;what a pity&#x27; (this meaning has been adopted by Modern Hebrew slang as well and is alike to the Italian use of ). The term can be used formally as a method for chastising strangers who behave inappropriately, or between friends as a form of teasing. The word is also used to instruct children in how to behave by telling them that harming other children or animals is haram, among other things.

The binary concepts of halal and haram are used in a number of cultural phrases, most notably (boy) and (girl) . These phrases are often used to refer to appropriate spouses in marriage, and stand in contrast to or , which are used as insults. In this case, the term &quot;haram&quot; is used to mean ill-mannered or indecent, instead of strictly meaning &#x27;unlawful&#x27;.

Halal and haram are also used in regards to money (). means ill-gotten money, and brings destruction on those who make their living through such means.

These cultural interpretations of what is haram influence and are influenced by the legal definitions used at a local level. This means that popular conceptions of haram are partly based on formal Islamic jurisprudence and partly on regional culture, and the popular conceptions, in turn, change how the legal system defines and punishes haram actions.

==Forbidden categories of actions==

===Food and intoxicants===

In the Quran and reports by early Muslims, forbidden meat includes pork, carnivores (lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, cats, etc.), non-ruminants (donkeys and horses), animals that were slaughtered in the name of a god other than Allah, animals that died due to illness, injury, stunning, poisoning, or slaughtering not in the name of Allah. Herbivores or cud-chewing animals like cattle, deer, sheep, goats, and antelope are some examples of animals that are halal and only if they are treated like sentient beings and slaughtered painlessly while reciting the words and Allahu Akbar. If the animal is treated poorly, or tortured while being slaughtered, the meat is haram.

===Marriage and family rules ===

Islam is very strict in prohibiting , whether it be adultery or sexual intercourse between two unmarried individuals.

In terms of marriage proposals, it is considered haram for a Muslim man to propose to a divorced or widowed woman during her (the waiting period during which she is not allowed to marry again). The man is able to express his desire for marriage, but cannot execute an actual proposal. It is also forbidden for a Muslim man to propose to a woman who is married to another man.

Relating to the topic of marriage, there is a common consensus that it is unholy and against the word of God to have romantic relations with someone of the same gender. This idea is not explicitly stated in the Quran, but is heavily frowned upon by the Islamic community.

In Islamic law, it is considered haram for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man.

====Inheritance====
It is considered haram for a father to deprive his children of inheritance. It is also haram for a father to deprive the women or the children of a wife who is not favorable to him an inheritance. Additionally, it is haram for one relative to deprive another relative of his inheritance through tricks.

===Business ethics===
, any excessive addition over and above the principal, such as usury and interest, is prohibited in Islam in all forms. Interest goes against the Islamic pillar of , which allows wealth to flow from the rich to the poor. is prohibited because it keeps wealth in the hands of the wealthy and keeps it away from the poor. It is also believed that makes a person selfish and greedy.

All business and trade practices that do not result in a free and fair exchange of goods and services are considered haram, such as bribery, stealing, and gambling. Therefore, all forms of deceit and dishonesty in business are prohibited in Islam.

Many Islamic jurists and religious bodies, including Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta of Saudi Arabia, have considered MLM trade to be haram, the reasons behind which are as follows: in this process, followings are related – exchange without labor and labor without exchange, contract on another contract or condition on another condition, similarity with (interest), similarity with gambling, widespread uncertainty of profits and losses, not everyone benefiting equally, financial fraud and torture, lying and exaggeration, etc.

===Clothing and adornment===

In Islam, both gold adornments and silk cloths are prohibited for men to wear but are permissible for women as long as they are not used to sexually attract men (other than their husbands). The prohibition of these adornments is part of a broader Islamic principle of avoiding luxurious lifestyles.

It is considered haram for both men and women to wear clothing that fails to cover the body properly (which stated in clothing guidance, the term ) and clothes that are transparent. Additionally, Islam prohibits excess beautifying that involves the altering of one&#x27;s physical appearance. In Sunni sects, extreme physical alterations such as tattoos, teeth filing, and cosmetic surgery are all considered haram.

Some Islamic sects also prohibit the use of gold and silver utensils and pure silk spreads in the household in order to avoid luxurious lifestyles in the home. Statues are also prohibited in homes, and some Muslims are prohibited from participating in making statues because they think it negates .

===Shirk===

Worshipping anyone or anything other than God, known as , is the most major sin for a Muslim.

<doc id="1117304" wikidata="Q1140440" url="?curid=1117304" title="Tasman Glacier">
<text>Tasman Glacier (officially Haupapa / Tasman Glacier) is the largest glacier in New Zealand, and one of several large glaciers which flow south and east towards the Mackenzie Basin from the Southern Alps in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island.

==Geography==
At in length, Tasman Glacier is still New Zealand&#x27;s longest glacier, despite shrinking considerably from the 1990s onwards. It is as much as wide and thick, and lies entirely within the borders of Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park. The glacier covers an area of and starts at a height of above sea level. Snowfall during the winter and spring seasons may accumulate up to . After the summer melt, may remain in the high altitude glacier head.
The Tasman flows south west from Hochstetter Dome and Mount Elie De Beaumont alongside the southern slopes of The Minarets and south along the eastern flank of New Zealand&#x27;s two highest mountains, Mount Tasman and its higher southern neighbour Aoraki / Mount Cook.

Although its upper reaches are snow-covered, rocks carried by the glacier are exposed by ablation along its course, and the lower glacier is entirely rock-covered. The rock cover helps insulate the ice from the sunlight and slows down the melting process. Tributaries in the lower parts are the Rudolf Glacier, Forrest Ross Glacier, named after Forrestina Ross), Kaufmann Glacier, Haast Glacier, Hochstetter Glacier, and Ball Glacier.

The glacial terminal lake is met by the meltwater of the Murchison Glacier, which approaches from the northeast and flows alongside the Tasman Glacier outside the moraine wall. The waters of Tasman Lake flow into the Tasman River and flow south joining the Hooker River draining the proglacial lakes on the Hooker and Mueller Glaciers. The Tasman River exhibits a braided characteristic, and flows south into Lake Pukaki. They eventually flow into the Waitaki River and to the Pacific Ocean north of Oamaru.

==Recent retreat==

The glacier remained at a constant in length for all of its recorded history in the 20th century before starting its current period of rapid melting in the 1990s. Between 2000 and 2008 alone, the glacier terminus receded 3.7 km. Since the 1990s the terminus has retreated about a year on average. The glacier is now in a period of faster retreat where the rate of retreat is calculated to be between each year. It is estimated that the Tasman Glacier will eventually disappear and the terminal Tasman Lake will reach a maximum size in 10 to 19 years time. In 1973 Tasman Glacier had no terminal lake and by 2008 Tasman Lake was long, wide, and deep.

A large calving event was possibly triggered, or at least contributed to, by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2011. On this day 30 to 40 million metric tons (33 to 44 million short tons) of ice dropped from the terminal face of the Tasman Glacier and fell into the Tasman Lake. Boats were hit with tsunami waves of up to as the ice fell into the Tasman Lake under the glacier. Similar events in the past have been attributed to buoyancy effects, a result of high basal water pressures and increased lake level following heavy rainfall events.

==Access and tourism==

Tasman Glacier has a long history of tourism, with heli skiing tours offered on the upper glacier since the early 1970s. The tributary Ball Glacier was also popular for skiing, with national championships being held there in the 1930s. It has since diminished too far to be safely accessed. Similarly, Tasman Glacier&#x27;s significant ice loss over the past decades has impacted tourism, with an increasing number of crevasses being exposed and not filled in by snow any more, requiring guided tours to avoid these areas, and restricting the heli skiing season to July, August and September.

The proglacial Tasman Lake is a popular destination for boat tours among the icebergs often floating in the lake. Boats are not allowed closer than to the tall terminal face of Tasman Glacier for safety reasons.

The Ball Shelter Track, part of the Ball Hut Route, leads along the western side of the glacier, separated from Tasman Lake by a tall moraine wall until about 6 kilometres in, where it climbs high enough for the view to open up. At that point, the rock-covered lower Tasman Glacier in the valley between the moraine walls is wide.

<text>Mount Cook Village, officially Aoraki / Mount Cook, is located within New Zealand&#x27;s Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park at the end of , only south of the summit of the country&#x27;s highest mountain, also called Aoraki / Mount Cook, in the Southern Alps.

Being situated inside a national park, it is not possible to own property in Mount Cook Village; however, because of the year-round operation of the hotel and motels, the village has a small permanent population of around 250.

All buildings and facilities operate on concessions and leases from the government. The village has no grocery stores apart from a small in-hotel convenience store. The nearest supermarket is away in Twizel, the closest town. There is a self-service petrol pump behind the hotel complex; however, the fuel price reflects the remote location.

Mount Cook Village operates a small school with a roll as low as a dozen children, the only school in New Zealand inside a national park.

==History==
The first building at the location of Mount Cook Village was the second Hermitage hotel, built in 1913 and opened in 1914; however, that building burned to the ground in 1957 and was replaced in 1958 by what later became the current hotel.

The 1960s and 1970s saw significant extensions to the hotel and Mount Cook Village, including water mains, sewerage treatment, local streets, and the sealing of State Highway 80, which greatly improved access. A local fire brigade was established in 1976.

The official name of the settlement was amended to a dual name, Aoraki / Mount Cook, by the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.

==Demographics==
Mount Cook Village is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement, and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the Mackenzie Lakes statistical area.
Before the 2023 census, Mount Cook Village had a larger boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Mount Cook Village had a population of 213 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 12 people (6.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3 people (1.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 27 households, comprising 99 males and 114 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.87 males per female. The median age was 29.5 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 24 people (11.3%) aged under 15 years, 87 (40.8%) aged 15 to 29, 93 (43.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 6 (2.8%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 53.5% European/Pākehā, 2.8% Māori, 8.5% Pasifika, 25.4% Asian, and 14.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 52.1% had no religion, 28.2% were Christian, 1.4% were Hindu, 1.4% were Muslim, 9.9% were Buddhist and 1.4% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 45 (23.8%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 12 (6.3%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $35,200, compared with $31,800 nationally. 12 people (6.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 177 (93.7%) people were employed full-time, and 9 (4.8%) were part-time.

==Tourism==
Mount Cook Village caters to a steady flow of around 250,000 visitors per year with a wide range of facilities and accommodation.

An international style hotel, &quot;The Hermitage&quot;, the name of which dates back to the original hotel built in 1884, is the only prominent larger building in the village and a popular location, especially for international tourists. The Hermitage is sometimes used as an alternative name for the settlement. The hotel also owns and operates chalets and a lodge and motel with options ranging from backpacker accommodation through to family units.

There are two more motels in the village, and a total of four restaurants or pubs, two of which are inside the main hotel complex. The buildings and motel units are connected via paved footpaths.
The small White Horse Hill camping ground is located about outside the village, connected via a walking track.

Commercial operations run guided walks, 4WD safaris, boating on the Tasman glacier lake, horse treks, fishing, and scenic flights including landing on the glaciers. These are based at the hotel, departing and returning to the hotel&#x27;s main entrance.

A number of nearby walks and climbs ranging from 10 minute bush walks to multi-day tramping tracks and routes can be explored from Mount Cook Village.

There are three short walking tracks through forest areas within the village and on its outskirts, as well as the starting points of longer walking tracks ranging from the popular and easy Hooker Valley Track to more strenuous walks such as the steep track to Sealy Tarns.

The village is home to the park&#x27;s visitor centre, and the starting point for climbers, hunters and trampers visiting the many huts.

The YHA backpacker hostel is due to close permanently in December 2021 due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

==Climate==
Mount Cook Village has an oceanic climate (Cfb). Summers are mild with cool nights while winters are chilly with nightly lows below freezing. Precipitation is extremely heavy year round.



== Education ==
Aoraki Mount Cook School is a full primary school serving years 1 to 8, with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1960.

<doc id="1117314" wikidata="Q1052736" url="?curid=1117314" title="Cel">
<text>A cel, short for &quot;celluloid&quot;, is a transparent sheet on which objects are drawn or painted for traditional, hand-drawn animation. Actual celluloid (consisting of cellulose nitrate and camphor) was used during the first half of the 20th century. Since it was flammable and dimensionally unstable, celluloid was largely replaced by cellulose acetate. With the advent of computer-assisted animation production (also known as digital ink and paint), the use of cels has been all but obsolete in major productions. Walt Disney Animation Studios stopped using cels in 1990, when Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) replaced this element in their animation process. In the next decade and a half, other animation studios phased cels out as well in favor of digital ink and paint.

== Technique ==

Generally, the characters are drawn and painted on cels and laid over a static background painting or drawing. This reduces the number of times an image has to be redrawn and enables studios to split up the production process to different specialised teams. Using this assembly line way to animate has made it possible to produce films much more cost-effectively. The invention of the is generally attributed to Earl Hurd, who patented the process in 1914.

The outline of the images are drawn on the front of the cel while colors are painted on the back to eliminate brushstrokes. Traditionally, the outlines were hand-inked, but since the 1960s they are almost exclusively xerographed on. Another important breakthrough in cel animation was the development of the Animation Photo Transfer Process, first seen in &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, released in 1985.

Typically, an animated feature would require over 100,000 hand-painted cels.

== Collector&#x27;s items ==
Production cels were sometimes sold after the animation process was completed. More popular shows and movies commanded higher prices for the cels, with some selling for thousands of dollars.

Some cels are not used for actual production work, but may be a &quot;special&quot; or &quot;limited edition&quot; version of the artwork, sometimes even printed (&quot;lithographed&quot;) instead of hand-painted. These normally do not fetch as high a price as original &quot;under-the-camera&quot; cels, which are true collector&#x27;s items. Some unique cels have fetched record prices at art auctions. For example, a large &quot;pan&quot; cel depicting numerous characters from the finale of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; sold for $50,600 at Sotheby&#x27;s in 1989, including its original background.

Disney Stores sold production cels from &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (their last film to use cels) at prices from $2,500 to $3,500, without the original backgrounds. Lithographed &quot;sericels&quot; from the same film were $250, with edition sizes of 2,500–5,000 pieces.

<text>In mathematics, the Lyapunov time is the characteristic timescale on which a dynamical system is chaotic. It is named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov. It is defined as the inverse of a system&#x27;s largest Lyapunov exponent.

==Use==
The Lyapunov time mirrors the limits of the predictability of the system. By convention, it is defined as the time for the distance between nearby trajectories of the system to increase by a factor of &quot;e&quot;. However, measures in terms of 2-foldings and 10-foldings are sometimes found, since they correspond to the loss of one bit of information or one digit of precision respectively.

While it is used in many applications of dynamical systems theory, it has been particularly used in celestial mechanics where it is important for the problem of the stability of the Solar System. However, empirical estimation of the Lyapunov time is often associated with computational or inherent uncertainties.

==Examples==
Typical values are:

<doc id="1117321" wikidata="Q7015508" url="?curid=1117321" title="New Zealand Motor Corporation">
<text>The New Zealand Motor Corporation was the New Zealand representative, importer, distributor and retailer of a number of the best-known British automobiles. It carried out the same functions for a wide range of manufacturers of industrial machinery and equipment. It inherited and operated four independent plants assembling CKD kits of British Leyland and from the late 1970s, Honda models. It was succeeded piecemeal by Honda New Zealand in the 1980s.

==Formation==
New Zealand Motor Corporation (NZMC) was formed and listed on the New Zealand Exchange in 1970. It was the long-delayed pooling of their ownership and resources by British Leyland&#x27;s two principal New Zealand representatives, motor assemblers, distributors and retailers: Dominion Motors (Nuffield) and the Austin Distributors Federation.

Together they had 3,000 staff, 40 retail branches and four car assembly plants Newmarket (Morris), Panmure (Morris), Petone (Austin) and Nelson (Rover-Triumph). At that time British Leyland brands had a good market share in New Zealand but sales dropped reflecting British Leyland&#x27;s sagging fortunes. New Zealand&#x27;s principal export customer, the United Kingdom, joined the Common Market in 1973 and took up different sources for its agricultural produce. The mid-1970s witnessed a firm switch to Japanese brands. Not until the end of the 1970s did Hondas begin to replace the British Marina and Princess on NZMC&#x27;s assembly lines. Economic difficulties in the early-1980s brought about a major restructuring of the New Zealand economy. A new government set about removing protection from many industries including local vehicle assembly. All NZMC assembly plants except the near-new former Rover-Triumph now Honda plant in Nelson had closed by 1988. Nelson closed in 1998.

===Products===

Cars and commercial vehicles, bus chassis and bodies, tractors, industrial and earthmoving equipment, diesel engines, cranes, shipping containers. While primarily producing vehicles for the New Zealand market, some were exported to Australia.

===Brands===
:Austin, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Leyland, Morris, Rolls-Royce, Rover, Triumph
:Aveling-Barford, Case, Cummins, Davis, ERF, Liebherr, Mitsubishi, WABCO, White

===Franchised dealers===
There were 65 franchised dealers in 1980.

==Honda==
Honda began acquiring the Honda assets from NZMC in the mid-1980s, first acquiring a 25% stake in 1985. Honda New Zealand Ltd was formed in 1988 and assembly of Honda passenger vehicles continued at the Nelson plant until August 1998, when tariffs on imported cars were abolished.

<doc id="1117322" wikidata="Q29907" url="?curid=1117322" title="Lotus corniculatus">
<text>Lotus corniculatus is a flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae. Common names include common bird&#x27;s-foot trefoil, eggs and bacon, birdsfoot deervetch, and just bird&#x27;s-foot trefoil (a name also often applied to other &quot;Lotus&quot; spp.). It has a wide distribution and is a favored forage for livestock.

==Description==
It is a perennial herbaceous plant. The height of the plant is variable, from , occasionally more where supported by other plants; the stems can reach up to long.

The name &#x27;bird&#x27;s foot&#x27; refers to the appearance of the seed pods on their stalk. Five leaflets are present, but with the central three held conspicuously above the others, hence the use of the name &#x27;trefoil&#x27;.

The flowers bloom from June to September and develop into small pea-like pods or legumes.

The plant had many common English names in Britain, which are now mostly out of use. These names were often connected with the yellow and orange colour of the flowers, e.g. &#x27;butter and eggs&#x27;. One name that is still used is eggs and bacon (or bacon and eggs).

It is similar in appearance to some clovers.
==Subtaxa==
The following subspecies are accepted:
*&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot; subsp. &quot;afghanicus&quot; 
*&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot; subsp. &quot;corniculatus&quot;
*&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot; subsp. &quot;delortii&quot; 
*&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot; subsp. &quot;fruticosus&quot; 
*&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot; subsp. &quot;preslii&quot; 

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot; has a broad distribution worldwide. It is native to temperate Eurasia and North Africa. It is common everywhere in Britain and Ireland.

Habitats include old fields, grassy places, and roadsides. It is typically sprawling at the height of the surrounding grassland. It can survive fairly close grazing, trampling, and mowing. It is most often found in sandy soils.

== Ecology ==
The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees. In the Chicago Region, mostly non-native bees have been observed visiting the flowers, including &quot;Andrena wilkella&quot;, &quot;Anthidium oblongatum&quot;, &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; and &quot;Megachile rotundata&quot;. The native bees &quot;Bombus impatiens&quot; and &quot;Megachile relativa&quot; have also been observed visiting birdsfoot trefoil flowers, though the latter only rarely.

The plant is an important nectar source for many insects and is also used as a larval food plant by many species of Lepidoptera such as six-spot burnet and the silver-studded blue. It is a host plant for the wood white butterfly, &quot;Leptidea sinapis&quot;.

=== As an invasive species ===
Birdsfoot trefoil is an invasive species in many parts of North America and Australia. It has been commonly planted along roadsides for erosion control or pastures for forage and then spreads into natural areas. Once it has established in an area, it can outcompete native species. The use of prescribed fire is not an effective management tool against &quot;L. corniculatus&quot; and herbicide is recommended instead to control it.

==Potential health concerns==
The species contains cyanogenic glycosides, which release small amounts of hydrogen cyanide when macerated. This is not normally poisonous to humans, though, as the dose is very low, and the metabolization of cyanide is relatively quick. Condensed tannins are also present.

==Uses==
It is used in agriculture as a forage plant, grown for pasture, hay, and silage. It is a high quality forage that does not cause bloat in ruminants. Taller-growing cultivars have been developed for this. It may be used as an alternative to alfalfa in poor soils.

A double-flowered variety is grown as an ornamental plant. It is regularly included as a component of wildflower mixes in Europe. It can also prevent soil erosion and provide a good habitat for wildlife.

In the traditional medicine of the Sannio regio of Italy, the diluted infusions were used for anxiety, insomnia, and exhaustion.

<text>Les Borges Blanques () is the capital of the comarca of Les Garrigues, in the province of Lleida, Catalonia, Spain. According to the 2014 census, the municipality has a population of 6,088 inhabitants.

==Geography==
It lies in the southern sector of the central Catalan depression, near the zone watered by the Urgell canal. The high plateaus are covered by olive groves. The economy is agricultural, and Les Borges Blanques is a major producer of olives, in particular a variety known as arbequina which produces a highly prized oil. The cooperative movement has strong roots in the area. There is little or no tourist infrastructure. The municipality is split into two parts, separated by Juneda municipality, the bigger eastern part having almost all the population.

The traditional symbol of this city is an ox, which appears on a widely used but unofficial coat of arms.

<doc id="1117328" wikidata="Q232254" url="?curid=1117328" title="Pickaxe">
<text>A pickaxe, pick-axe, or pick is a generally T-shaped hand tool used for prying. Its head is typically metal, attached perpendicularly to a longer handle, traditionally made of wood, occasionally metal, and increasingly fiberglass.

A standard pickaxe, similar to a &quot;pick mattock&quot;, has a pointed end on one side of its head and a broad flat &quot;axe&quot; blade opposite. A gradual curve characteristically spans the length of the head. The next most common configuration features two spikes, one slightly longer than the other.

The pointed end is used both for breaking and prying, the axe for hoeing, skimming, and chopping through roots. 

Developed as agricultural tools in prehistoric times, picks have evolved into other tools such as the plough and the mattock. They also have been used in general construction and mining, and adapted to warfare.

==Etymology==
The Oxford Dictionary of English states that both &quot;pick&quot; and &quot;pickaxe&quot; have the same meaning, that being a tool with a long handle at right angles to a curved iron or steel bar with a point at one end and a chisel or point at the other, used for breaking up hard ground or rock.

The term &quot;pickaxe&quot; is a folk etymology alteration of Middle English via Anglo-Norman , Old French , and directly from Medieval Latin , related to Latin . Though modern picks usually feature a head with both a pointed end and an adze-like flattened blade on the other end, current spelling is influenced by &quot;axe&quot;, and &quot;pickaxe&quot;, &quot;pick-axe&quot;, or sometimes just &quot;pick&quot; cover any and all versions of the tool.

==History==
In prehistoric times a large shed deer antler from a suitable species (e.g. red deer) was often cut down to its shaft and its lowest tine and used as a one-pointed pick, and with it sometimes a large animal&#x27;s shoulder blade as a crude shovel.
During war in medieval times, the pickaxe was used as a weapon.

==As a weapon==
The historic pickaxe was readily adapted to a weapon for hand-to-hand combat in ancient times. Over the centuries aspects of it were incorporated in various battle axes.

A pickaxe handle (sometimes called a &quot;pickhandle&quot; or &quot;pick helve&quot;) is sometimes used on its own as a club for bludgeoning. In &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; by John Steinbeck, pick handles were used against migrant farmers, and Georgia governor Lester Maddox famously threatened to use a similar, more slender axe handle to bar blacks from entering a whites-only restaurant in the heated days of the American civil rights movement of the 1960s. A pick handle is officially used as a baton in the British Army.

Pickaxes are commonly carried by Pioneer Sergeants in the British Army.

A normal pickaxe handle is made of ash or hickory wood and is about and weighs about . British Army pickaxe handles must, by regulation, be exactly long, for use in measuring in the field. New variant designs are:
* With a plastic casing on the thick end.
* Made of carbon fibre

They are sometimes made with a steel casing on the thick end.

<text>SAS &quot;Amatola&quot; (F145) is the first of four frigates for the South African Navy by the European South African Corvette Consortium.

&quot;Amatola&quot;, in keeping with a naming convention depicting acts of valour, was named after the Amatola mountain range in the Eastern Cape area where British forces fought the Xhosa nation in late 1852. Mrs Zanele Mbeki (wife of then President Thabo Mbeki), named the vessel at the Blohm &amp; Voss Thyssen Rheinstahl, Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft (HDW) and Thales shipyards in Germany just after noon on 7 June 2002.

==Construction==
The vessels of the class were manufactured by the European South African Corvette Consortium (ESACC), consisting of the German Frigate Consortium (Blohm+Voss, Thyssen Rheinstahl and Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft), African Defence Systems (part of the French Thales defence group) and a number of South African companies.

The ships were built to the MEKO modular design concept, and are designated by the manufacturer as the MEKO A-200SAN class. Some controversy exists as to the class type of the vessel, with both the manufacturer and the South African Navy referring to her as a &quot;corvette&quot;, but other similar vessels in other navies being referred to as frigates. Some have claimed that the use of the word &quot;corvette&quot; was a political decision made by the South African government to ease criticism of the procurement of the vessels.

SAS &quot;Amatola&quot; was built at the Blohm + Voss shipyards in Hamburg, Germany, and she arrived in South Africa on 4 June 2003. She was next fitted out with her various weapons and electronic systems, and weapons integration trials were begun in October 2004. This was followed by the warship&#x27;s commissioning on 16 February 2006.

On 7 April 2006 &quot;Amatola&quot; arrived from Kiel after accompanying the submarine to Simon&#x27;s Town on her maiden voyage.

==Status==
According to a presentation made to the Joint Standing Committee on Defence by Rear Admiral B.K. Mhlana, Deputy Chief of the Navy in May 2023, &quot;Amatola&quot; had been scheduled for a refit since 2018 but no work had been done to date. Her mid-life update, originally scheduled for 2024, had been postponed to 2027. The admiral described the ship as effectively non-operational until a refit could be completed.

In 2024 it had been planned to embark the ship on a long voyage, including participaton in the Russian Navy&#x27;s &quot;Navy Day&quot; in St. Petersburg. However, the deployment had to be cancelled due to “current defects to the vessel”.

==Notable Deployments==

During 2007, this vessel became the first South African frigate in decades to take part in the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Basic Operational Sea Training&quot; (BOST) programme, however without any embarked Super Lynx 300 helicopters, since these had not been delivered by the Westland company at the time.

<text>The Death Ship (German title: &quot;Das Totenschiff&quot;) is a novel by the pseudonymous author known as B. Traven. Originally published in German in 1926, and in English in 1934, it was Traven&#x27;s first major success and is still the author&#x27;s second best known work after &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. Owing to its scathing criticism of bureaucratic authority, nationalism, and abusive labor practices, it is often described as an anarchist novel.

==Plot summary==

Set just after World War I, &quot;The Death Ship&quot; describes the predicament of merchant seamen who lack documentation of citizenship, making them effectively stateless and therefore unable to find legal residence or employment in any nation. The narrator is Gerard Gales, a US sailor who claims to be from New Orleans, and who is stranded in Antwerp without passport or working papers. Unable to prove his identity or his eligibility for employment, Gales is repeatedly arrested and deported from one country to the next, by government officials who do not want to be bothered with either assisting or prosecuting him. When he finally manages to find work, it is on the &quot;Yorikke&quot; (possibly a reference to the Shakespeare play &quot;Hamlet&quot;), the dangerous and decrepit ship of the title, where undocumented workers from around the world are treated as expendable slaves.

The term &quot;death ship&quot; refers to any boat so decrepit that it is worth more to its owners overinsured and sunk than it would be worth afloat. The title of the book is translated directly from the German &quot;Das Totenschiff&quot;; in English, they are called &quot;coffin ships&quot;.

== Publication history ==

Traven first wrote &quot;Das Totenschiff&quot; in English in 1923 or 1924. Editor Ernst Preczang of the German publisher requested its translation into German, having appreciated Traven&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Published in 1926, &quot;Das Totenschiff&quot; was Traven&#x27;s first book and his renown was cemented in its success. There were 12 German editions and eight language translations before its first English publication in 1934.

Just before the German version went to press, the publisher wrote to Traven asking for publicity information and photographs. The author replied:

My personal history would not be disappointing to readers, but it is my own affair which I want to keep to myself. I am in fact in no way more important than is the typesetter for my books, the man who works the mill; ... no more important than the man who binds my books and the woman who wraps them and the scrubwoman who cleans up the office.

==Adaptations==
In 1959 it was adapted into a film of the same name (also known as &quot;Ship of the Dead&quot;) directed by Georg Tressler.

The Finnish alternative theater group KOM staged an adaptation of the novel in 1982.

<text>The Council of Three (, ) was a collegial body created by the Polish Government in Exile in 1954 with prerogatives of the President of Poland. It consisted of three members of the government chosen by the Council of National Unity (&quot;Rada Jedności Narodowej&quot;), a rump parliament in exile.

It was created in 1954, after President August Zaleski declined to leave his office after his seven-year term ended. According to the Polish April 1935 constitution, the legal basis for the existence of the government in exile, the president was allowed to choose his successor &quot;during a war, in case his office falls vacant before the peace treaty is signed&quot;. The post-war &quot;Akt Zjednoczenia Narodowego&quot; (&quot;National Unity Act&quot;) was an agreement among all the major political parties that assumed that presidents were to choose their successors every seven years, but that was rejected by Zaleski.

Initially, the &quot;Rada Trzech&quot; was a self-proclaimed committee of opposition to Zaleski, but on 21 July 1956, the &quot;Rada Jedności Narodowej&quot; granted it the powers of the Polish head of state. It was dissolved in July 1972, following Zaleski&#x27;s death on 7 April that year. The &quot;Rada Trzech&quot; ceded its powers to Zaleski&#x27;s successor, Stanisław Ostrowski.

==Members==
The members of the Rada Trzech were:
* General Władysław Anders (until 1970)
* Edward Raczyński (until 1972)
* Tomasz Arciszewski (until 1955)

Tomasz Arciszewski died in 1955. His place was taken by:
* General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski (1956-1966)
* General Roman Odzierzyński (1966-1968)
* Stanisław Mglej (1968-1969)
* Alfred Urbański (1969-1972)

Władysław Anders died in 1970. His place was taken by:
* General Stanisław Kopański (1970-1972)

<doc id="1117340" wikidata="Q1769761" url="?curid=1117340" title="Penn, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Penn is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, about north-west of Beaconsfield and east of High Wycombe. The parish&#x27;s cover Penn village and the hamlets of Penn Street, Knotty Green, Forty Green and Winchmore Hill. The population was estimated at 4,168 in 2019.

==History==
The name is Brittonic in origin, comparable with the modern Welsh typonym &quot;pen&quot;, and may mean &quot;hill top&quot; or &quot;end&quot;. Penn stands on a strong promontory of the Chiltern Hills. From the tower of Holy Trinity Parish Church, it is claimed to be possible to see into several other counties.

==Penn family==
Segraves Manor, the principal seat in Penn, belonged to the Penn family. Sybil Penn, wife of David, was dry nurse and foster mother to King Edward VI and Lady of the Bed Chamber to his sister, Queen Elizabeth I. 

The Penn estate directly benefited from the Slave Compensation Act of 1837. The family owned two plantations in Jamaica and a total of 210 individuals split between the Clarendon and the Oak plantations. The estate was awarded a total of 4095 pounds, the equivalent of half a million pound today.

The Penn family of Penn were not known to be related to William Penn (after whose father, Admiral Sir William Penn, Pennsylvania is named), whose family came from Wiltshire. In 1735 the manor of Penn passed from the unmarried Roger Penn to his sole heir and sister, who was married to the 3rd Baronet Scarsdale, an ancestor of the Lords Curzon. Penbury Grove House was built in 1902 by the American engineer Horace Field Parshall as a replica of Pennsbury Manor, William Penn&#x27;s house in Pennsylvania, Parshall wrongly thinking that these Penns shared a connection with Pennsylvania.

==Myth==
Penn is reputedly haunted by the ghost of an 18th-century farm labourer, who appears laughing, on a phantom horse.

==Commons and sports==
Penn Street, Knotty Green and Forty Green are hamlets in the parish, each within a mile of the main village.

Penn Street and Knotty Green have village commons, where the Penn Street and Knotty Green cricket clubs play. The local public houses, The Squirrel in Penn Street and The Red Lion in Knotty Green, face their respective commons. Forty Green also has a pub – The Royal Standard of England. Penn has a non-League football club, Penn &amp; Tylers Green F.C., which plays at Elm Road.

==Penn today==
The area is part of the Chiltern Hills and popular with people who commute to London due to its proximity to road junction 3 of the M40 motorway at Loudwater, mainline rail at Beaconsfield and London Underground at Amersham, both linked with the city.

Penn remains home to Earl Howe of the Penn-Curzon-Howe dynasty, which gained more wealth through the Inclosure Acts, which gave legal property rights to land previously in communal use. In 1855, ownership of Common Wood and Penn Wood passed to the 1st Earl Howe, forcing many local people and their livestock off the land. This caused general unrest within the community. For centuries, villagers had sustained themselves by grazing their animals on the common and gathering what they could from the land. When the woods became private property, many were plunged further into poverty. Years of unlawful protest followed, when poaching was rife and fences were pulled down as local people tried to retrieve what they deemed legitimately theirs.

Penn Street churchyard contains items from Gopsall, Lord Howe&#x27;s other country house in Leicestershire. The lychgate and Countess Howe memorial were moved from Congerstone in 1919, when the family sold the Gopsall Estate.

==In popular culture==

The Cottage Bookshop in Penn was one location in &quot;A Tale of Two Hamlets&quot;, an episode of the ITV television programme, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. It was also used to film an episode called &quot;Bookshop Chuckles&quot; in the children&#x27;s television show, &quot;ChuckleVision&quot;, and the three-acre set for &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; was constructed there.

==Notable people==
*The novelist Elizabeth Taylor died in Penn in 1975. 
*Medical pioneers Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson (1873–1943), her partner Dr Flora Murray and the children&#x27;s writer Alison Uttley, author of the Little Grey Rabbit stories, are buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity.

<text>Philip James Hammond (born 1 January 1962) is a British physician, broadcaster, comedian and commentator on health issues in the United Kingdom. He is best known for his humorous commentary on the National Health Service. He first came into the public spotlight writing a column for &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, where he wrote with a strong pro-patient rights line and as &quot;Private Eye&quot;″s medical correspondent &quot;MD&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hammond lived in Australia until the age of seven when his Australian father, Barrie Rees Hammond, Ph.D., a Cambridge-educated physical chemist, killed himself at the age of 38. His English mother moved the family back to England. Hammond was educated at Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School until its closure in 1975, then at its successor St John&#x27;s Comprehensive, before obtaining a place at Marlborough College as his father had taught there.

Hammond qualified as a doctor in 1987, having studied at Girton College, Cambridge and St Thomas&#x27; Hospital Medical School, London.

==Medical career==
Hammond has worked as a lecturer in Medical Communication at the Universities of Birmingham and Bristol. He previously worked as a GP before retraining as an associate specialist in chronic fatigue syndrome.

==Broadcasting and performances==

He starred in his own show &quot;59 Minutes to save the NHS&quot; at the Edinburgh Fringe and was one of two doctor-cum-comics who captained teams on a Channel Five medical quiz, &quot;Tibs and Fibs&quot;, hosted by Tony Slattery.

As well as appearing on Channel 4&#x27;s longest running programme, &quot;Countdown&quot;, Hammond has starred in the BBC Two TV series &quot;Trust Me, I&#x27;m a Doctor&quot; and in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Struck Off and Die&quot; and &quot;28 Minutes to Save the NHS&quot;. He has appeared on the BBC TV news quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, as well as the original and longer-running &quot;The News Quiz&quot; on BBC Radio 4 and &quot;The Now Show&quot; on the same station. He also writes the &quot;Medicine Balls&quot; column in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;M.D.&quot; (use of pseudonyms is routine for &quot;Private Eye&#x27;s&quot; regular columnists).

He presents the &quot;Music Group&quot; on BBC Radio 4 and was a regular contributor to Gabby Logan&#x27;s Sunday morning show on BBC Radio Five Live. He also has a Saturday mid-morning show on BBC Radio Bristol between 9am and 12noon.

Hammond toured the UK between 2011 and 13 with &quot;Dr Phil&#x27;s Rude Health Show&quot;, which was released on DVD in two parts: &quot;Dr Phil&#x27;s Rude Health Show&quot; and &quot;Confessions of a Doctor&quot;. They were broadcast of BBC Radio 4 Extra in August 2011. He returned to the Edinburgh Fringe for the eighth time in 2011.

In September 2013 he began touring the UK with a new show, &quot;Games to Play with Your Doctor&quot;.

Hammond did two shows at the 2016 Edinburgh Fringe: &quot;Life and Death (But Mainly Death)&quot; and &quot;Dr Phil&#x27;s NHS Revolution&quot;. He toured them together as &quot;Dr Phil&#x27;s Health Revolution&quot; in 2017.

===Non-medical broadcasting===
Hammond co-presented &quot;The Heaven and Earth Show&quot; on BBC One with Juliet Morris in 2000. He presented two series for BBC Radio 4 of &quot;Pillories of the State&quot; in 1999/2000 and presents the &quot;Music Group&quot;, also on Radio 4 (sixth series 2011). Hammond has also frequently appeared as a guest in the Dictionary Corner on &quot;Countdown&quot;.

Hammond was a presenter for BBC Radio Bristol from 2007, broadcasting on Saturday mornings until, on 21 August 2018, he was sacked from the show, after announcing his intention to stand for election as an MP for the National Health Action Party, in the constituency of Jacob Rees-Mogg.

==Writing==

Hammond was one of those who broke the story about the Bristol heart scandal in 1992 and was later called to give evidence at the subsequent enquiry.

In 2009, Hammond broke allegations about pathology misdiagnosis in Bristol, the subject of an independent inquiry chaired by Jane Mishcon. He also campaigned for an inquiry into the sacking of Cornwall Council chief executive John Watkinson. His &quot;Private Eye&quot; columns are available on his website.

In July 2011, Hammond co-authored a &quot;Private Eye&quot; special investigation with Andrew Bousfield called &quot;Shoot the Messenger&quot;, exposing the shocking treatment of NHS whistleblowers and how large sums of public money are used to silence them and cover up their concerns. It triggered an early day motion in Parliament by Peter Bottomley, MP. Hammond and Bousfield also launched a website dedicated to NHS staff, patients and relatives who have highlighted concerns about safety in the NHS. They were involved in referring Barbara Hakin to the General Medical Council.

Hammond co-authored &quot;Trust Me, I&#x27;m a Doctor&quot; (Metro Books) with Michael Mosley, the executive producer of the BBC2 series of the same name. There are two editions (1999 and 2002), both out of print. Hammond is the sole author of &quot;Medicine Balls – Consultations with the World&#x27;s Greatest TV Doctor&quot; (2007, 2008) and &quot;Trust Me, I&#x27;m (Still) a Doctor&quot; (2008, 2009) and &quot;Sex, Sleep or Scrabble? - Seriously Funny Answers to Life&#x27;s Quirkiest Questions&quot; (2009, 2010) and &quot;What Doctors Really Think...16 Years of Wit, Wisdom, and Lies&quot; (2014). His most recent book is &quot;Staying Alive: How to Get the Best From the NHS&quot;

With David Spicer, Hammond wrote a four-part BBC Radio 4 satire called &quot;Polyoaks&quot;, about GPs struggling with the then-government&#x27;s NHS reforms. First broadcast in June 2011, it starred Nigel Planer, Tony Gardner, Celia Imrie, David Westhead, Carla Mendonça, David Holt, Phil Cornwell and Kate O&#x27;Sullivan, with a second series of four transmitted in 2012. Spicer and Hammond&#x27;s third series of four episodes of &quot;Polyoaks&quot; ran on BBC Radio 4 from 6 June 2014. Accessed: 13 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth series, consisting of six episodes, was broadcast in 2016. A fifth series was commissioned for broadcast in 2017.

In 1999, he was reported to the General Medical Council by William Hague&#x27;s press secretary over an article he wrote about Hague&#x27;s slow recovery from a cold. He writes for the &quot;Mendip Times&quot;, celebrating life on the Mendips and in surrounding areas.

In 2021, he published &quot;Dr Hammond&#x27;s Covid Casebook&quot;, a collection of 30 of his fortnightly columns in &quot;Private Eye&quot; which formed a detailed analysis of the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in England.

==Politics==
While a junior doctor, Hammond contested the 1992 general election under the title &quot;Struck Off and Die Doctors Alliance&quot;. He ran in the Bristol West constituency against William Waldegrave, the then Secretary of State for Health, capturing 87 votes.

In August 2018 he announced his intention to stand for election as an MP for the National Health Action Party, in the North East Somerset constituency of Jacob Rees-Mogg. As a result, the BBC sacked him from his Bristol radio show.

==Other roles==
Hammond is vice-president of the Patients Association and a patron of Meningitis UK, the Doctors Support Network, the Herpes Viruses Association, Patients First and Kissing It Better. He is an advisor for the Association of Young People with ME and a champion for the Point of Care Foundation. He is also a patron of My Death, My Decision, an organisation which seeks a more compassionate approach to dying in the UK, including giving people the legal right to a medically assisted death if that is their persistent wish.

<text>Angeghtun () or Ingilene (; ) was a district of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia centered on the city and fortress of Anggh (, ), which gave its name to the district. Anggh is often identified with the modern city of Eğil in Turkey, and may have also been the site of Carcathiocerta, capital of the Kingdom of Sophene, and the settlement Ingalawa mentioned in Hittite records. Angeghtun bordered Andzit (Anzitene), possibly at the Taurus Mountains, to its west and Great Tsopk (Sophanene) to its east, possibly at the Western Tigris.

While the district of Angeghtun was likely ruled by a branch of the Orontid dynasty that ruled the Kingdom of Sophene, Armenian sources describe the fortress of Anggh as a royal fortress of the kings of Armenia where the royal treasures were kept. The Grand Chamberlain of Armenia ( or ) was in charge of administering the fortress and the wealth within it. According to Cyril Toumanoff, Anggh was likely the central fortress of one of the four s of the Kingdom of Armenia, who were high-ranking nobles in charge of defending the kingdom&#x27;s border regions.

<text>The Magic Finger is a 1966 children&#x27;s story by British author Roald Dahl. First published in the United States by Harper &amp; Row with illustrations by William Pène du Bois, Allen &amp; Unwin published the first U.K. edition in 1968. Later editions have been illustrated by Pat Marriott, Tony Ross, and Quentin Blake.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Magic Finger&quot; is narrated by an unnamed eight-year-old girl who is growing up on a remote rural farm in the English countryside, next door to the Gregg family who have a passion for hunting animals and birds. The titular &quot;Magic Finger&quot; is an ability the girl has that activates inadvertently whenever she gets angry: the finger itself shoots out a beam of electrical energy that apparently seeks out whoever has angered the girl, with unpredictable consequences. For example, when the girl&#x27;s teacher, Mrs. Winter, shames her for misspelling the word &quot;cat&quot;, the magic finger gives Mrs. Winter whiskers and a bushy tail, and the girl cryptically states that Mrs. Winter was never quite the same again.

One day, the girl sees Mr. Gregg and his two sons, Philip and William, returning home from a hunt with a deer that they have just killed, and they make fun of her and tell her to mind her own business when she shouts at them. In a rage, the girl puts the Magic Finger itself on the entire family; when they wake up the following morning they have shrunk to bird-size and developed &quot;ducks&#x27; wings&quot; in place of their arms and hands. While trying out their new wings, the Greggs fly out of their house, which is promptly occupied by four human-sized ducks with human arms and human hands, and they are all soon forced to build a nest in an old tree for the night.

The following morning, the Greggs all find that, in a major reversal of their habits, three out of four of the ducks are holding the Greggs&#x27; hunting guns in their hands. Desperately, Mr. and Mrs. Gregg both persuade the ducks not to shoot them, but the mother duck (the only duck who never holds a gun) taunts them about their own fondness for shooting, especially since the previous day, they somehow shot all six of the duck&#x27;s children. Mr. Gregg tells the duck mother to give up shooting and he destroys all three guns with a big hammer, swearing never to hurt another duck, deer, &quot;or anything else again&quot;. The four ducks then head back toward the lake where they live, before letting the Greggs leave their tree. Then, the Greggs all find themselves returned to normal by magic.

The eight-year-old girl comes by the Greggs&#x27; farm to see that the Gregg family (now changing their surname to Egg) have fully changed their ways and are now feeding and caring for the birds. As Philip and William tell the girl their entire story, the sound of gunfire in the distance attracts the girl&#x27;s attention, and she feels the Magic Finger charging up again.

==Adaptations==
===Audio===
An unabridged recording of the book read by Roald Dahl himself was released as part of a compilation set by Harper Children Audio. A 1980&#x27;s version released by WM Collins features Anne Clements as narrator. The 2013 edition of the audiobook featured narration by Kate Winslet and was released on digital audio by Penguin Audio.

===Animation===
The story was adapted into an original video animation (OVA) by Abbey Broadcast Communications in 1990, which was released straight-to-video through Abbey Home Entertainment. It was a faithful adaption of the original story, which was told through Clements&#x27; audiobook recordings against animations in the style of Quentin Blake&#x27;s illustrations. Re-releases from 1997 onwards redubbed Clements&#x27; narration with that of actress Caroline Quentin. For its 2005 DVD release, the original narration was reinstated.

<text>ISO 4 (Information and documentation — Rules for the abbreviation of title words and titles of publications) is an international standard which defines a uniform system for the abbreviation of serial publication titles, i.e., titles of publications such as scientific journals that are published in regular installments.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has appointed the ISSN International Centre as the registration authority for ISO 4. It maintains the &quot;List of Title Word Abbreviations&quot; (&quot;LTWA&quot;), which contains standard abbreviations for words commonly found in serial titles. , the standard&#x27;s most recent update came in 1997, when its third edition was released.

A major use of ISO 4 is to abbreviate the names of scientific journals using the LTWA. For instance, under ISO 4 standards, the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot; is cited as &quot;J. Biol. Chem.&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of Polymer Science Part A&quot; should be cited as &quot;J. Polym. Sci. A&quot; (capitalization is not specified by the standard). The standard notes that &quot;Full stops shall only be used to indicate an abbreviation. Full stops may be omitted from abbreviated words in applications that require limited use of punctuation&quot; (section 4.6).

It was initially published in 1972 (ISO 4:1972), with a second edition published in 1984 (ISO 4:1984), and the third edition in 1997 (ISO 4:1997).

<text>The Twits is a 1980 children&#x27;s novel by British author Roald Dahl. It was first published by Jonathan Cape. The story features The Twits (Mr. and Mrs. Twit), a spiteful, lazy, unkempt couple who continuously play nasty practical jokes on each other to amuse themselves and exercise their devious wickedness on their pet monkeys.

Dahl&#x27;s disgust at beards was the inspiration for Mr. Twit. As Dahl stated, he penned &quot;The Twits&quot; in an effort to &quot;do something against beards&quot;. Dahl&#x27;s biographer, fellow children&#x27;s author Michael Rosen, recalls the first time the pair met, Dahl leant across to Rosen&#x27;s son Joe and said of his father&#x27;s beard: &quot;It&#x27;s probably got this morning&#x27;s breakfast in it. And last night&#x27;s dinner. And old bits of rubbish, any old stuff that he&#x27;s come across. You might even find a bicycle wheel in it&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;The Twits&quot; was listed at number 81 in &quot;The Big Read&quot;, a BBC survey of the British public of the top 200 novels of all time. In 2012, the titular Twits appeared on a Royal Mail commemorative postage stamp. In 2023, the novel was ranked by BBC at no. 87 in their poll of &quot;The 100 greatest children&#x27;s books of all time&quot;. &quot;The Twits&quot; was adapted for the stage in 2007 and an animated film adaptation, directed by Phil Johnston, is scheduled for release in 2025 on Netflix.

Penguin Books has released the book in audiobook form twice, in 2001 read by Simon Callow and in 2023 read by Richard Ayoade.

==Overview==
The idea of &quot;The Twits&quot; was triggered by Dahl&#x27;s desire to &#x27;do something against beards&#x27;. The first sentence of the story is &#x27;What a lot of hairy-faced men there are around nowadays&#x27;.

==Plot==
A hideous, vindictive, spiteful married couple known as the Twits live together in a brick house without windows. They continuously play nasty practical jokes on each other out of hatred for each other. They also keep a former family of pet monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps. The Twits, who are retired circus trainers, are trying to create the first upside-down monkey circus. They will always demand the monkeys stand on their heads for hours on end.

Mr. Twit uses glue called &quot;Hugtight&quot; in hopes of catching birds for Mrs. Twit to make into a bird pie. The monkeys try to warn the birds before they land on the tree, but the English-speaking birds do not understand the monkeys&#x27; African language. Once a week, the Roly-Poly bird flies to visit the monkeys, to secretly save the birds by acting as an interpreter of languages. On a Tuesday night, a group of four boys see the ladder next to this tree and they decided to walk up into it, not thinking or knowing that glue was on it. The following morning, Mr. Twit sees that the boys have scared the birds away. Out of rage, Mr. Twit charges at the boys, but they escape. Mr. Twit tries several times to catch the birds and, tired of not getting anywhere, Mr. and Mrs. Twit decide to go buy guns to kill the birds.

The Muggle-Wumps come up with an idea to use Mr. Twit&#x27;s glue to attach the Twits&#x27; furniture to their ceiling, while the birds come up with an idea to smear glue on the Twits&#x27; heads. Shocked, the Twits rush into their home and see the resulting mess. Mrs. Twit freaks out, thinking they are upside down, so Mr. Twit suggests that they stand on their heads so that they are &quot;the right way up&quot;. The Roly-Poly bird then offers to fly the Muggle-Wumps all the way back to Africa, and the Muggle-Wumps escape.

Hours later, both Mr. and Mrs. Twit are putting all their weight down on the heads and catch the &quot;Dreaded Shrinks&quot; with their bodies compressing &quot;downwards&quot;. The Twits&#x27; head shrinks into their neck, their necks shrink into their bodies, their bodies shrink into their legs, and their legs shrink into their feet. Their feet shrink into nothing but two pairs of shoes and old clothes. A week later, Mr. and Mrs. Twit are then nowhere to be seen, and their absence is promptly celebrated by everyone.

===Mr. Twit===
Mr. Twit is a wicked person, having hair that covers his entire face, with the exception of his forehead, eyes, and nose. Mr. Twit&#x27;s hair (which he falsely believes makes him appear &quot;wise and grand&quot; but is widely agreed by everyone else makes him look like a twit), is unkempt. Because he never washes it, Mr. Twit&#x27;s beard holds scraps of food stuck there while he ate, including tinned sardines, Stilton cheese, and corn flakes. Occasionally, Mr. Twit licks these scraps out and eats them when he is hungry.

As part of a plan to make Mrs. Twit feel that she is shrinking, he slowly extended her chair and cane until she was convinced that she was getting shorter.

Instead of wiping his mouth with a cloth, Mr. Twit simply wipes it on his sleeve. Mr. Twit is a drinker with a fondness for beer as he even drinks alcohol at breakfast. Mr. Twit is known to be very quiet when he is plotting. Mr. Twit and his wife mistreat their monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps, as they have kept Muggle-Wump and his family locked up in a cage in the garden. The dreaded shrinks eventually demolish Mr. Twit into nothing. All that was left of the Twits was two bundles of old clothes, two pairs of shoes and a walking stick.

===Mrs. Twit===
Mrs. Twit is the hideously ugly and menacing wife of Mr. Twit. She is said to have quite a nice face once, but her ugly thoughts began to show on her face until she was so ugly, you could not bear to look at her.

Mrs. Twit takes advantage of her glass eye to play practical jokes in revenge against her husband, and demonstrates multiple acts of cruelty and viciousness throughout the story: the main reason behind her use of a walking cane was as a weapon against innocent children and animals, she participates in the torment of the couple&#x27;s pet monkeys the Muggle-Wumps, and she once served Mr. Twit a lunch of worms disguised as spaghetti.

While Mrs. Twit frequently demonstrates acts of stupidity, she has also exhibited intelligence as she managed to maneuver her way out of being carried off into the sky by balloons by chewing through several of the strings and landing safely on the ground. Aside from this, Mrs. Twit is portrayed as being hideous, cruel and unhygienic.

==The Tricks==

A series of pranks advance the plot of the story. Brief descriptions appear below:

===The Glass Eye===
Mrs. Twit removes her glass eye and drops it in her husband&#x27;s beer mug while he isn&#x27;t looking. It isn&#x27;t until he empties the mug that he sees the eye sitting in there, startling him something awful. Mrs. Twit laughs, gloating that this proves she is always watching him.

===The Frog===
In revenge for the glass eye trick, Mr. Twit places a frog in Mrs. Twit&#x27;s bed, and frightens Mrs. Twit by claiming the item in her bed is a &#x27;Giant Skillywiggler&#x27;, with &#x27;teeth like screwdrivers&#x27; with which it would bite off her toes. Mrs. Twit then faints, at which point Mr. Twit splashes a jugful of cold water onto her face. Mrs. Twit soon recovers, as the frog hops onto her face to get near the water.

Mr. Twit then claims the &quot;Giant Skillywiggler&quot; will soon bite off her nose. Mrs. Twit then flees.

===The Wormy Spaghetti===
Seeking revenge for the Frog Trick, Mrs. Twit places worms from the garden in cooked spaghetti, which Mr. Twit eats, being reassured by Mrs. Twit that it is merely a new kind called &#x27;Squiggly Spaghetti&#x27; she has recently bought. When he has eaten it, Mrs. Twit joyfully reveals the truth, to Mr. Twit&#x27;s horror and disgust.

===The Shrinks===
In revenge for the Wormy Spaghetti, Mr. Twit glues pieces of wood no thicker than a penny onto Mrs. Twit&#x27;s cane each night, as well as onto the legs of her chair, making Mrs. Twit believe that she is slowly shrinking.

Mr. Twit then frightens her by claiming that she has contracted an illness called the &#x27;shrinks&#x27;, by which she will be caused to disappear. Mr. Twit then claims that to cure the shrinks, Mrs. Twit will have to be &#x27;stretched&#x27;. Mr. Twit then ties Mrs. Twit up in the garden to 60 gas balloons intending to leave her there for a while to teach her a lesson.

However, once Mrs. Twit makes the mistake of saying that if the strings break, it&#x27;s goodbye for her, Mr. Twit pretends to tie some more strings to her ankles, before cutting through the strings and sending her skywards. Mrs. Twit eventually returns by biting through several of the balloon strings so she sinks slowly down, eventually collapsing on Mr. Twit in the garden and beating him senseless with her long walking stick immediately afterwards.

===The Sticky Tree===
There is a &#x27;Big Dead Tree&#x27; in the Twits&#x27; garden, which Mr. Twit uses to trap birds by spreading HUGTIGHT Sticky Glue on the branches. Captive birds are then made into a pie by Mrs. Twit. During the story four schoolboys are caught instead of birds, but escape by unfastening their trousers and falling to the ground outside the Twits&#x27; garden after Mr. Twit said that he will make boy pie instead of bird pie. It is this use of glue that gives the captive monkey Muggle-Wump and his family the idea of using it against the Twits.

===Rescuing the Animals===
Using their friend the Roly-Poly Bird as an interpreter of languages, Muggle-Wump and his wife and children convey the warning that any bird landing on the Big Dead Tree will be cooked into Mrs. Twit&#x27;s Bird Pie. When Mr. Twit, in retaliation, spreads glue on the monkeys&#x27; cage (which serves as a substitute perch), the monkeys alter the warning. The birds end up landing on the Twits&#x27; roof.

This enrages Mr. Twit, who doesn&#x27;t want to keep waiting for his pie, so the Twits decide to go to the shop and buy a gun each. During their absence on this errand, Muggle-Wump plots a final trick: to turn the Twits&#x27; house upside down. With the help of the birds, Muggle-Wump removes the carpet from the floor, as well as all of the tables, chairs, and other objects in the house, and uses Mr. Twit&#x27;s glue to stick the objects upside down to the ceiling, leaving the floor absolutely bare.

By doing this, the Twits will believe that they have been turned upside down, as they will be standing on what looks like the ceiling of their house and will stand on their heads to be the right way up. To keep their heads glued to the ground, two birds will put a small amount of glue on the Twits&#x27; heads right before they enter the house so that when they stand on their heads, they will be stuck.

Just as the preparations for this trick are finished, the Twits return home. Everything goes as planned, the Twits believed they&#x27;ve been turned upside down and so stand on their heads to counter it, only to be stuck to the bare floor. However, heads are not made to be stood upon. With so much weight on it from above, the Twits literally get &#x27;the shrinks&#x27;, as was mentioned earlier in the book, but this time it&#x27;s not a trick; it&#x27;s the real thing. After a week or so, the Twits disappear, and everyone who knew of them shouts &#x27;hooray!&#x27;. Meanwhile, the Muggle-Wumps and the Roly-Poly bird escape to their native African land.

==2023 censorship controversy==

Despite Roald Dahl having instructed his publishers not to &quot;so much as change a single comma in one of my books&quot;, in February 2023 Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Books, announced that it would be re-writing portions of many of Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novels, changing the language to, in the publisher&#x27;s words, &quot;ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today&quot;. The decision was met with sharp criticism from groups and public figures including authors Salman Rushdie and Christopher Paolini, British prime minister Rishi Sunak, Queen Camilla, Kemi Badenoch, PEN America, and Brian Cox. Dahl&#x27;s publishers in the United States, France, and the Netherlands declined to incorporate the changes.

In &quot;The Twits&quot;, more than a dozen changes were made, including changing &quot;ladies and gentlemen&quot; to &quot;folks&quot; and removing words like &quot;batty&quot;, &quot;nutty&quot;, &quot;screwy&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot;, and &quot;hag&quot;.

==Film adaptation==

In February 2003, a feature film adaptation of the book entered development at Vanguard Animation with its founder John H. Williams set to produce. As part of a multi-picture deal with Walt Disney Pictures, Vanguard was set to produce a CG animated/live-action film, with John Cleese and Kirk DeMicco writing the screenplay.

In November 2004, Mark Mylod signed up to direct the feature, while Cleese was attached to star in the film. In October 2006, after the executive/regime changes at Disney, the project moved to Working Title and Universal. By January 2012, the official site of Vanguard Animation stated that Conrad Vernon, the director of &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot; (2009), would direct the film.

By April 2022, an animated television series for Netflix was turned into a feature film. An animated film, directed by Phil Johnston, is scheduled for release in 2025.

==Theatrical adaptations==
In April 1999, a theatrical musical adaptation by Justin Pearson (general manager and the artistic director of the UK&#x27;s National Symphony Orchestra) and actress Anne Collis, directed by Michael Dineen was presented at The Questors Theatre in Ealing, West London. 

A second production of &quot;The Twits&quot; adapted by Enda Walsh and directed by John Tiffany was performed at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre in 2015, running from 7 April to 31 May. The cast included Jason Watkins as Mr. Twit, Monica Dolan as Mrs. Twit, Glyn Pritchard as the Monkey Father and Cait Davis as the Monkey Mother.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown, a theatrical reading of &quot;The Twits&quot; was performed at London&#x27;s Unicorn Theatre directed by Ned Bennett and performed by Zubin Varla and Martina Laird. The performance was recorded and originally streamed in three parts over YouTube.

==Relations to other Roald Dahl books==
* A monkey named Muggle-Wump also appears in &quot;The Enormous Crocodile&quot;. A monkey bearing resemblance to Quentin Blake&#x27;s illustration of the same character also appears in &quot;The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me&quot;.
* A Roly-Poly Bird likewise makes an appearance in &quot;The Enormous Crocodile&quot; and is also to be found in &quot;Dirty Beasts&quot;.
* Certain things within the book, such as Mr. Twit&#x27;s beard, &#x27;Wormy Spaghetti&#x27; and bird pie, appear within &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Revolting Recipes&quot;.
* An extremely strong glue is also mentioned in &quot;Matilda&quot;.
* The birds&#x27; descriptions of Muggle-Wump&#x27;s sanity (&quot;dotty&quot;, &quot;balmy&quot;, &quot;batty&quot;, &quot;nutty&quot;, &quot;screwy&quot;, &quot;wacky&quot;) are the same as those used by the parents to describe Willy Wonka&#x27;s sanity in Chapter 18, &quot;Down the Chocolate River&quot;, of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

==Continuation novel==
In 2024, it was announced that Greg James and Chris Smith would co-write a continuation novel titled The Twits Next Door illustrated by Emily Jones.

<doc id="1117363" wikidata="Q7163130" url="?curid=1117363" title="Penn, West Midlands">
<text>Penn is an area divided between the City of Wolverhampton and South Staffordshire district. The population of the Wolverhampton Ward taken at the 2011 census was 12,718. Originally, it was a village in the historic county of Staffordshire. 

The area to the east of Penn Road (A449) and around St Bartholomew&#x27;s church is referred to as Upper Penn, historically also as Penn Over. The village within South Staffordshire, and around St Anne&#x27;s church is Lower Penn or Penn Under. These historic usages tend to confirm that the name has long been considered to refer to the ridge to the east, which is ascended via Church Hill, Wakeley Hill or Mount Road.
It is not clear exactly which areas fall within Penn. In 19th century censuses, Merry Hill, Bradmore were understood to form part of Penn, although these areas are generally understood to be separate today. However, the two historic settlements of Upper and Lower Penn form the core of the area.

== History ==
&quot;Penn&quot; is probably derived from the Welsh language, signifying a hill or promontory, and is believed to refer to the hill on which St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church stands. The pre-Anglo-Saxon name may indicate relatively late survival of Celtic-speaking settlement.
There was a settlement and possibly a church in Anglo-Saxon times: Domesday Book records Lower Penn as having belonged to Countess Godiva of Mercia and Upper Penn to her son, Earl Algar. In 1912, the base of an Anglo-Saxon preaching cross was discovered close to St Bartholomew&#x27;s church. In fact, the name Penn suggests (but does not prove) that there was a pre-Anglo-Saxon settlement, with possible survival of Celtic language and culture locally into the Anglo-Saxon period.

The Norman conquest of England brought a major shift in land ownership. The Penn area, along with a wide tract of Mercia, was assigned by William the Conqueror to Ansculf de Picquigny, who built a motte and bailey fortress at Dudley. By 1087, the time of Domesday Book, the Penn area belonged to Ansculf&#x27;s son, William Fitz-Ansculf. He had installed in Upper Penn a tenant called Robert, who also held lands from him in Bushbury, Ettingshall, Moseley and Oxley. The settlement had eight villagers and two smallholders. In Lower Penn, which had only 6 villagers with one freeman, he had another tenant, called Gilbert. Clearly both places were still mere hamlets.

Penn has had a church since at least around 1200 when St. John the Baptist&#x27;s Church was first established by Sir Hugh de Bushbury, apparently a descendant of the tenant Robert. The provision of a sizeable church suggests that Upper Penn, at least, had expanded considerably by this time, in line with a general growth of population and prosperity that began in the late 12th century. Hugh gave all the tithes from Upper Penn to the support of the church, making the holder of the living a Rector. The first incumbent was John of Wolverhampton. Around 1228, the founder&#x27;s son, also Sir Hugh de Bushbury, married his cousin. As this match fell within the bounds of consanguinity he was forced to bribe the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield with the living of Penn. This did not stop the Bushbury family trying to reassert their control in later generations, although the bishops ultimately managed to retain their authority over appointments. The dedication of the church was later changed to St Bartholomew, but it is unclear when the name was changed: it is not attested before the 19th century. Some of the original fabric survives, but the present, mainly brick, building is largely the result of major restorations and enlargements in 1765, 1799 and 1845.

By the mid-12th century, Lower Penn was in the hands of the Buffery or Buffor family, who held it until the mid-15th century. It was sometimes called Penn Buffor.

Penn&#x27;s growth in the Middle Ages was probably driven by its position on a major route, connecting not just the local towns of Wolverhampton, Stourbridge and Kidderminster, but the county towns of Stafford and Worcester, and forming part of the main north–south route of Western England. Traffic struggled up and along the ridge, past the hamlet of Ryecroft to Upper Penn. The present route of the A449/Penn Road evolved only in the modern period, with an 18th-century toll road providing a more convenient thoroughfare and bypassing Upper Penn village.

A guidebook of 1851 says:
Penn is a large parish, comprising 3890 acres, and the two townships and villages of Upper and Lower Penn, the former of which has 716 and the latter 226 inhabitants. The Duke of Sutherland is lord of the manor, and owner of a large portion of the soil. The rest belongs to the following resident freeholders, JW Sparrow, Esq, of Penn Hall; the Rev William Dalton, of Lloyd House; Robert Thacker, Esq, of Muchall Hall; Sidney Cartwright, Esq, of the Leasowes, and a few smaller owners.

A large part of Penn has been absorbed progressively into Wolverhampton, which became a County Borough in 1930 and a Metropolitan borough in 1974, thus detaching much of Penn from the administrative county of Staffordshire. This gradual expansion of the boundaries of Wolverhampton was accompanied by a rapid development of suburban housing, particularly from the Edwardian period, with many residents depending on the Sunbeam car works for employment. Despite the depression of the 1930s, a further surge in housebuilding occurred, with much post-war infill. As a result, the area to the north and west of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s church is almost entirely occupied by Wolverhampton&#x27;s suburban housing.

==Ecclesiastical divisions==
Nowadays, the Parish of Penn contains part of suburban Wolverhampton and part of rural South Staffordshire, where the village of Lower Penn is situated about one mile (1.6 km) to the west, within South Staffordshire and containing the parish&#x27;s other church, St Anne&#x27;s. However a large part of Penn in suburban Wolverhampton now falls within other parishes, in particular the Parish of Penn Fields, served by the churches of St Philip, St Joseph and St Aidan.

==Penn ward within Wolverhampton==
Penn (population 12,392) is a formal ward of Wolverhampton, West Midlands. Penn ward borders the wards of Merry Hill, Graiseley and Blakenhall as well as South Staffordshire. It forms part of the Wolverhampton West constituency.

There are three focal points where shops and other facilities are located, all situated on the A449 Penn Road, which runs south-west from Wolverhampton City Centre: Upper Penn (which is closest to Wolverhampton and contains a hospital), Penn itself, and Springhill (which is adjacent to the city&#x27;s boundary with Staffordshire).

Penn is a generally advantaged area with many upmarket houses that are mostly situated in the south of the area on land bordering the extensive South Staffordshire countryside.

There are four primary schools within Penn: Springdale, St Bartholomew&#x27;s C of E, Warstones and Woodfield, all of which include nursery schools. There is also a community special school called Penn Hall School in Vicarage Road. There are no secondary schools in the ward, although a secondary school existed in Manor Road (Penn Secondary Modern School) which was later used by Colton Hills Secondary School for the first two years of senior school prior to expansion of the main Colton Hills site. Shortly after closure, the school buildings were demolished to make way for the present Penn Manor Medical Centre with housing built on the remaining site.

Penn Library is situated in Upper Penn. Planned for closure under council cutbacks, it was ultimately retained. In addition to St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church (Anglican), there is St Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Penn United Reformed Church and Springdale Methodist Church. A further smaller Anglican church is St. Aidans located in Mount Road. A church in Wynchcombe Avenue was demolished and replaced by housing in the 1980s.

There are currently five public houses in Penn, these are The Mount Tavern, The Roebuck, Rose &amp; Crown and The Holly Bush on Penn Road while the Barley Mow is in Pennwood Lane next to Penn Golf Course (technically in South Staffordshire). The Stags Head in Sedgley Road has been closed for several years and recently was the subject of a planning application for conversion to a six bedroom house. As of April 2022, this is awaiting a council decision. Still standing but no longer a pub is the former Fox &amp; Goose next to Tesco Express. This was converted to a restaurant several years ago but is currently closed.

== Penn Common ==
Penn Common is a substantial area of countryside which juts into the urban area between Penn, Wolverhampton and Sedgley (part of Dudley). An important amenity for local people, it is occupied by a golf course and farmland. It is overlooked from the east by St Bartholomew&#x27;s church, descends to a hamlet centred on the old Lloyd&#x27;s brewery, and rises again to the village of Gospel End. Most of its area falls within South Staffordshire.

==Transport==
Most of Penn is served by National Express West Midlands 15/ 15A (Wolverhampton - Kingswinford - Merry Hill Shopping Centre) and 16 (Wolverhampton - Wombourne - Stourbridge) and Diamond Bus 64 (Wolverhampton - Penn, Wakeley Hill). Warstones Road is served by the 4 (which starts from Pendeford) and operates via the City Centre, Bradmore and Merridale.

Service 16 is based on a former Midland Red bus route. Local service 2 connects the Warstones housing estate with the City Centre and Bushbury. The wide junctions at Mount Road and Springhill Lane date back to trolleybus services, these being the turning points for the service. Older residents still refer to the area located at the Springhill Lane shops as &quot;the terminus&quot;.

Until closing in 1968, Penn Common was served by a regular bus service from Wolverhampton to Sedgley, having started as a Midland Red service whose main custom was Baggeridge Colliery. For several years after closure additional short workings to Gospel End continued. In 1986, the 564 service was split with West Midlands Travel retaining the route along Mount Road and the Penn Common section being operated under Staffordshire County Council tender by Midland Red West until 1992. The tender was subsequently operated by a number of operators including Stevensons and Arriva Midlands. Over time the number of journeys across Penn Common dwindled until the service was withdrawn in 2017. In August 2020, the Green Bus ran a commercial shopping service (582) to Kidderminster but this attracted little custom.

<text>George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine (known as George&#x27;s Marvelous Medicine in the US) is a children&#x27;s novel written by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake. First published by Jonathan Cape in 1981, it features George Kranky, an eight-year-old boy who concocts his own miracle elixir to replace his tyrannical grandmother&#x27;s regular prescription medicine.

Being a medical expert was one of what Dahl called his &quot;dreams of glory&quot;: he had enormous respect for doctors and particularly those who pioneered new treatments. He dedicated the book to &quot;doctors everywhere&quot;. In 2003, it was listed at number 134 on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Read&quot; poll.

==Plot==
While eight-year-old George Kranky&#x27;s parents are out grocery shopping, his elderly maternal grandmother bosses him around and bullies him. She intimidates him by saying that she likes to eat insects and he wonders briefly if she&#x27;s a witch. As a punishment for her regular abuse, he decides to make a magic medicine to replace her old prescription one. He collects a variety of ingredients from around the family farm including deodorant and shampoo from the bathroom, floor polish from the laundry room, horseradish sauce and gin from the kitchen, animal medicines, engine oil and anti-freeze from the garage, and brown paint to mimic the colour of the original medicine.

After cooking the ingredients in the kitchen, George gives it as medicine to his grandmother, who grows as tall as the house, bursting through the roof. When she doesn&#x27;t believe it was him who made her do so, he proves it to her by feeding the medicine to one of his father&#x27;s chickens, which grows ten times its original size. As they return home, Mr. and Mrs. Kranky can&#x27;t believe their eyes when they see the giant chicken and grandmother. Mr. Kranky grows very excited at the thought of rearing giant animals. He has George feed the medicine to the rest of the farm&#x27;s animals, causing them to become giants as well. However, his grandmother begins complaining about being ignored and stuck in the house, so Mr. Kranky hires a crane to remove her from it. Her extreme height has her sleeping in the barn for the next few nights.

The following morning, Mr. Kranky is still excited about George&#x27;s medicine and announces that he and George shall make gallons of it to sell to farmers around the world, which would make his family rich. George attempts to recreate it but is unable to remember all the ingredients. The second version makes a chicken&#x27;s legs grow extremely long, and the third elongates another one&#x27;s neck to bizarre proportions. The fourth has the opposite effect of the first and makes animals shrink. George&#x27;s grandmother, now even more angry because she has to sleep in the barn, storms over and starts complaining loudly that she&#x27;s once again sick of being ignored. She sees the cup of medicine in George&#x27;s hand and erroneously mistakes it for tea. Much to his and Mrs. Kranky&#x27;s horror, and Mr. Kranky&#x27;s delight, she drinks the entire cup and shrinks so much that she vanishes completely. Mrs. Kranky is initially shocked, confused, and distraught about her mother&#x27;s sudden and strange disappearance, but soon accepts that she was becoming a nuisance anyway. In the last page, George is left to think about the implications of his actions, feeling as though they had granted him access to the edge of a magic world.

In the cookbook &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Completely Revolting Recipes&quot;, collaborated on by Felicity Dahl and chefs Josie Fison and Lori-Ann Newman, George&#x27;s medicine was adapted into &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine Chicken Soup&quot;, the ingredients of which included chicken, onions, mushrooms, leeks, and tarragon.

==Influence==
Dahl was influenced by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, with the &quot;Drink Me&quot; episode inspiring a scene in &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot; where the tyrannical grandmother drinks a potion concocted by George and is blown up to the size of a farmhouse.

==Safety concerns==
Though it was a popular book for reading to children in primary school, great care was taken by teachers to warn children to not try and recreate the medicine at home due to the hazardous nature of some of its ingredients. There is a disclaimer warning before the story stating &quot;Warning to Readers: Do not try to make George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine yourselves at home. It could be dangerous.&quot; In 2020, a team of British researchers performed a toxicological investigation into the potion and all 34 of its ingredients. They reported in the &quot;BMJ&quot; that if ingested, it would cause vomiting, kidney injury, convulsions, and other severe health problems, including &quot;the most likely clinical outcome&quot;, death. &quot;The overall outcome for Grandma would be fatal catastrophic physiological collapse,&quot; they wrote.

==2023 censorship controversy==

Despite Roald Dahl having enjoined his publishers not to &quot;so much as change a single comma in one of my books&quot;, in February 2023 Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Books, announced it would be re-writing portions of many of Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novels, changing the language to, in the publisher&#x27;s words, &quot;ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today.&quot; The decision was met with sharp criticism from groups and public figures including authors Salman Rushdie and Christopher Paolini, British prime minister Rishi Sunak, Queen Camilla, Kemi Badenoch, PEN America, and Brian Cox. Dahl&#x27;s publishers in the United States, France, and the Netherlands announced they had declined to incorporate the changes.

In &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot;, more than fifty changes were made, including removing references to the deadly power of the marvellous medicine, removing the acknowledgement that a footstool is used by a woman because she is short, changing references to &quot;pale brown teeth&quot; to &quot;rotting teeth&quot; and obscuring references to things traditionally associated with housewives (such as using a sink or dressing table)

==Television version==

<doc id="1117371" wikidata="Q2192112" url="?curid=1117371" title="The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me">
<text>The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me is a 1985 children&#x27;s book written by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake. The plot follows a young boy named Bobby who meets a giraffe, a pelican, and a monkey, who work as window cleaners.

Although the story is narrated in first-person by Bobby, the word &quot;Me&quot; in the title refers to the monkey, who concludes every verse of his signature song with the phrase &quot;the giraffe and the pelly and me&quot;.

==Plot==

The story is told from the point of view of Bobby, a young boy who has always dreamed of owning a sweet-shop. His ambition is strengthened by the fact that there is an abandoned three-storey building named The Grubber, an old English word for a sweet-shop, near where he lives. One day, he finds that the old building has been renovated and has become the head office for The Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company. Bobby then meets its members: a Giraffe with an extendable neck; a Pelican, or &quot;Pelly&quot; as he is called by the others, who has a flexible upper beak; and a singing and dancing Monkey, all of whom he quickly befriends. Having only recently arrived in England, all the animals are finding it hard to acquire the right food to feed themselves. This includes fish for the Pelican, especially his favorite salmon; walnuts for the Monkey; and pink and purple tinkle-tinkle tree flowers for the Giraffe (this is all she can eat, as she happens to be a &quot;Gereneous Giraffe&quot;). Bobby and the animals all band together when they receive a letter from the Duke of Hampshire asking them to clean the 676 windows of Hampshire House.
Things go smoothly when they get there until, while cleaning the bedroom windows of Henrietta the Duchess, the Giraffe and the Monkey spot a burglar attempting to steal the Duchess&#x27;s jewels. The Pelican then flies in and catches the burglar, holding him prisoner in his beak despite the burglar&#x27;s attempt to shoot his way out with his gun (this makes a hole in the Pelican&#x27;s beak, but the Duke assures him that the chauffeur can patch it up). Soon the police arrive to arrest the burglar, whom the Chief of Police identifies as the &quot;Cobra&quot;, one of the world&#x27;s most dangerous cat burglars.
As a reward for retrieving the Duchess&#x27;s jewels, the Duke invites The Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company to live on his estate as his personal helpers. Since he is the owner of the only tinkle-tinkle tree plantation in England, as well as thousands of walnut trees and an enormous salmon river (the River Hamp), all three starving animals have found the answer to their dilemma. Bobby&#x27;s dreams also come true because the Giraffe, Pelican, and Monkey will no longer need the Grubber building; with a little help from the Duke, the Grubber is revived into the most fantastic sweet shop for miles around (among the sweets it sells are Liplickers and Plushnuggets from Norway, one of the “lands of the midnight sun”), and the story ends with Bobby running the shop and The Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company continuing their business (and the Pelican&#x27;s beak having been fixed). Bobby gives each of his new friends special gifts: to the Giraffe, a bag of Glumptious Globgobblers, to the Monkey, a bag of Devil’s Drenchers, to the Pelican, a bag of Pishlets, and to the Duke, a bag of Scarlet Scorchdroppers. The Monkey, before leaving with the others, sings a little song to Bobby (thus the ending).

==Stage adaptation==
The book was adapted and staged at the Little Angel Theatre, London in December 2015. Andrew Pulver of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the play as &quot;a perfect Christmas treat for children.&quot; 

==Relations to other Roald Dahl books==
* When Bobby reopens The Grubber he chooses to sell sweets made by the Willy Wonka company, which features in Dahl&#x27;s earlier novels &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot;. In &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, a person who sucks rainbow drops can spit in only six different colors; there are seven in &quot;The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me&quot;. Sometimes the rainbow is said to have seven colors: orange, red, yellow, green, blue, indigo (dark blue), and violet (or purple). More often, they are said to be red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. However, one version of the cover of the book features a person spitting in pink instead of orange.
* The Monkey, in both appearance and diet, bears a strong resemblance to Muggle-Wump, a monkey from two of Dahl&#x27;s earlier books: &quot;The Enormous Crocodile&quot; and &quot;The Twits&quot;.
* Among the sweets that Bobby sells in The Grubber are Fizzwinkles, from China. They are referenced in one of Dahl&#x27;s earlier novels, &quot;The BFG&quot;, except there they are spelled &quot;Fizzwinkel&quot;.

<text>The Bznunis () are an ancient authority, a nakharars () family in Armenia.

== Genealogy==

According to ancestral story, which tells us Movses Khorenatsi, the dynasty of Bznunis originates from Baz forefather. Baz was Manavaz Haykazuni&#x27;s grandson. He inherited the north-western part of Lake Van. The sea was named after his name Bznunyac and the province Bznuniq. According to other historical evidence, in the northern part of Armenia-Lori, Baz founded the Bazakert province with Bazaberd castle about which there had been numerous references at medieval Armenian historians.

== History==

The tribe of Bznunis at prior period chaired the position of a royal Leader then a military chief of stuff position. The tribal emblem of the Bznunis was the Hawk, which later had become the tribe&#x27;s blazon. At the time of Trdat III the Great they were entrusted the Dzora border mountain pass. The Bznuni nakharars were military commanders and boundary governors. The Bznunis are mentioned in Royal and Military letters. At the times of Khosrov Kotak, the tribe householder Databen Bznuni disobeying the centripetal authorities rebelled against the king. In Arest battle Vache Mamikonyan breaks some of the rebels and the rest escape. Afterwards, Databen Bznuni was brought to the king in chains, and according to the time punishment means he was condemned to death as a traitor, by stoning. However, manorial elite of Bznunis still existed and that loyal house of patriarchal orders still retained the former disobedient and the sovereign lifestyle, so Vache Mamikonyan was given a command to destroy the entire household council which was the part of conspiracy, subsequently the Bznuni possessions were confiscated and joined to the royal estates. Later on, as an occupied province, it had been given to Aghbianos bishop with conferring order, for the church was limited to the pagan architectural lands and with the acquisitions of confiscated domains. Despite the elimination of the elite tribe, the dynasty of Bznunis was able to maintain their existence in feudal order. In manuscripts from the 6th and 7th centuries Bznuni bishops had been mentioned, we can meet a customer and recipient Bznuni archimandrites, which is indicative of the protection and maintenance of their manorial and aristocratic degrees. Permanently the description of the tribal property location names had been vivid, for example in the 13th century.

Khlat is mentioned as «a city of Bznuni Khlat» and speaking about the destruction of the tribe is definitely understood the elimination of the tribal council of elders and household authorities, because the numerous members of the tribe were connected with relative and other acting ties and were coalesced around all places in the state from centuries. Therefore, the Bznuni nakharars family assignees were rarely mentioned. In the manuscript, records of the 16th and 17th centuries (there) are mentioned as a customer, recipient or a master. Nerses Archimandrite Bznuni (born in 1839 Karin ), Simon Bznuni bishop of St. Thaddeus Monastery, late 19th-century religious leaders Nerses and Hovhannes archimandrites of Balu province, a participant of Sardarapat battle in 1918 from May 21 to 29, ARF Haroutyun Bznuni, 20th-century Persian-Armenian poet Levon Bznuni and others also come from the Bznuni tribe. Till nowadays there are members of the tribe.

<text>4ZZZ (pronounced &quot;Four Triple Zed&quot; or simply &quot;Triple Zed&quot;) is an independent community radio station operating in Brisbane, Australia at the frequency 102.1 FM. As a community radio station, 4ZZZ is a member of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA). The station broadcasts to much of South East Queensland, parts of northern New South Wales and web streams from its website.

==History==
In the 1970s, activists in Queensland were pivotal in establishing Australian community radio amidst a conservative political climate. Australia&#x27;s first community station, 4ZZZ, launched on December 8, 1975, in Brisbane, aimed to provide a radical alternative to mainstream news, promote community engagement and activism, and support Australian music. The station was the first FM community broadcaster in Brisbane transmitting in stereo. This model inspired other stations across the state. Today, there are 70 community radio stations in Queensland, including Indigenous services. Despite the significant contributions of women, trans, and non-binary individuals, their roles have often been overlooked.

The station&#x27;s first studios were constructed by announcing staff and volunteers, using second-hand building materials and furniture. The first transmitter was hand built by the station engineer Ross Dannecker with help from Dave Aberdeen. Founders included activist, Jim Beatson, journalist Marian Wilkinson, Arts Administrator, John Stanwell and academic Alan Knight. Announcer John Woods launched the station with The Who&#x27;s &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; at Midday 8 December 1975 (a month after The Dismissal). Along with 2JJJ and 3RRR, 4ZZZ has been a major promoter of independent and alternative music providing exposure for many Australian and international artists. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s the station also produced many groundbreaking and award-winning features and documentaries.

On 30 November 1978, the transmitter moved from the University of Queensland student union building to Mount Coot-tha when the station was granted a full licence. At this time, the frequency changed from 105.7 MHz to 102.1 Mhz.

4ZZZ pushed the boundaries by broadcasting illegal obscenities. In 1981 an organisation called &quot;The Society to Outlaw Pornography&quot; reported them to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. 4ZZZ successfully defended themselves, leading to changes which make it legal to swear on Australian TV and radio under certain circumstances.

On 14 December 1988, as part of a conservative backlash to the ousting of Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, 4ZZZ was taken off air and forcibly evicted from its University of Queensland premises by the then UQ Union ALSF and Young Nationals student union executive, led by Victoria Brazil. While university students rallied to support the station, 4ZZZ moved to alternative premises on Coronation Drive in the suburb of Toowong. In 1994 the station was able to obtain a loan to buy the former headquarters of the Communist Party of Australia. 4ZZZ still broadcasts from these premises on Barry Parade in Fortitude Valley.

==Station philosophy and funding==
The motto for the station is agitate, educate, organise. (The saying dates from New York in the early 1880s.) They aim to &quot;Provide a voice for marginalised communities&quot; -

4ZZZ aims to challenge the mainstream media by providing access for the community to radio, by supporting local bands, artists and events, by providing training for station volunteers, and by disseminating alternative news and current affairs.

All fundraising is run by the station. The main sources of income are subscriptions, sponsorship, promotions and 4ZZZ events. 4ZZZ collaborates with local businesses, gig promoters, etc. to provide incentives such as discounts for subscribers.

The station&#x27;s volunteers have won many awards including Community Broadcasting Association of Australia awards and national media awards.

In 2015 4ZZZ won the Tony Staley Award for excellence in community broadcasting for its efforts to include more people with a disability via the Ability Radio Project and appointed the first Station Advocate for People with a Disability in 2017.

==Programming==
As a community radio station, 4ZZZ broadcasts a wide variety of music, information and news. Presenters do not have to follow a playlist. Announcers personally choose the on-air musical content, or station subscribers request tracks. Unlike other radio stations, there is no music or program director. There are coordinators for those departments, however the ultimate decision rests with the program makers who must abide by the station policy.

The station has set minimum quotas for music content since the 1980&#x27;s with the original floor quotas set for female &amp; Non-binary, Australian and New Zealand, Brisbane and South-East Queensland Artists. 4ZZZ also sets a target for New music (defined as any new song published in the last 4 months)

The quotas and targets have changed over the course of the station&#x27;s history, with New Zealand quotas being dropped, and Quotas for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander produced content added. The below table is an abridged history of those changes

All 4ZZZ announcers are current financial subscribers to the station as well as dedicated volunteers who have completed the station&#x27;s In House Announcer Training.

The programming strategy has evolved in the station over time, but the current approach breaks shows into 4 distinct groups, General music shows, Specialist Music Shows that focus on a single or set of genres, News and Current Affairs programming, and Sociocultural Shows which focus on a subculture of the audience.

A full list of shows is available on their website, below are a few examples of each programming category

===1996 market day riots===
Cybernana Market day was held on 19 October 1996 in Musgrave Park, West End. During the night, a large police presence was seen patrolling the area outside the fence around the Park. There were several arrests for alleged drug possession and other minor street offences. At around 8:20 p.m. a severe storm hit without warning and organisers were forced to close the event. Within 10 minutes more than half of the crowd had left and police began to appear in larger numbers.

It is estimated that more than 100 police were mobilised, including mounted police and police from the Public Safety Response Team equipped with riot gear. The arrival of such large numbers of police at less than 10 minutes notice indicated that police were on stand-by for the event. Crowds sheltering in tents were physically forced from the park, people attending the event were beaten with batons and arrested.

Complaints were made to the Criminal Justice Commission but no police were ever reprimanded.

<doc id="1117383" wikidata="Q2358233" url="?curid=1117383" title="Esio Trot">
<text>Esio Trot is a 1990 children&#x27;s novel by British author Roald Dahl. The title is an anadrome of &quot;tortoise&quot;. It was the last of Dahl&#x27;s books to be published in his lifetime; he died just two months later.

Unlike other Dahl works (which often feature tyrannical adults and heroic/magical children), &quot;Esio Trot&quot; is the story of an aging lonely man (Mr. Hoppy), trying to make a connection with a person that he has loved from afar (his widowed neighbour, Mrs. Silver).

In 1994, Monty Python star Michael Palin narrated the English language audiobook recording of the book. In 2015 it was adapted by Richard Curtis into a BBC television film, &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Esio Trot&quot;, featuring Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench as the couple, with James Corden narrating. Geoffrey Palmer later narrated a second English-language recording.

==Plot==
Mr. Hoppy, a shy bachelor, harbours romantic feelings for his neighbour, the widowed Mrs. Silver. One morning, Silver expresses her wish to make Alfie, her pet tortoise, grow larger. Hoppy gives Silver a &quot;spell&quot; written on a piece of paper and tells her to whisper it in the tortoise&#x27;s ear. In reality, Hoppy has bought tortoises of varying sizes from pet shops; he builds a special tool to snatch the tortoise from Mrs. Silver&#x27;s balcony.

Mr. Hoppy continues to switch Mrs. Silver&#x27;s current pet with larger ones, but she still does not realize that her pet is growing in size, until Mrs. Silver notices that Alfie can no longer fit through the door to his house. Mr. Hoppy summons his courage and asks Mrs. Silver if he can come down and see the effect for himself. Mrs. Silver gladly grants his request. She thanks her friend for the spell, but the tortoise can no longer fit in the house. Hoppy tells her how to &quot;reverse&quot; the spell and they marry.

==2023 censorship controversy==

Despite Roald Dahl having enjoined his publishers not to &quot;so much as change a single comma in one of my books&quot;, in February 2023 Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Books, announced it would be re-writing portions of many of Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novels, changing the language to, in the publisher&#x27;s words, &quot;ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today.&quot; The decision was met with sharp criticism from groups and public figures including authors Salman Rushdie and Christopher Paolini, British prime minister Rishi Sunak, Queen Camilla, Kemi Badenoch, PEN America, and Brian Cox. Dahl&#x27;s publishers in the United States, France, and the Netherlands announced they had declined to incorporate the changes.

In &quot;Esio Trot&quot;, more than a dozen changes were made, including removing reference to Mrs Silver being &quot;attractive&quot;, changing &quot;I&#x27;ll be your slave for life&quot; to &quot;You&#x27;ll be my hero for life&quot; (and similar), and removing reference to a woman changing her surname upon marriage.

==Film adaptation==

The book was turned into a BBC One television film of the same name. It features Dustin Hoffman, as Mr Hoppy and Judi Dench as Mrs Silver, with James Corden as the narrator. It was screened on 1 January 2015 and received praise, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; calling it &quot;a thing of wonder&quot;.

<doc id="1117384" wikidata="Q1629107" url="?curid=1117384" title="Filing cabinet">
<text>A filing cabinet (or sometimes file cabinet in American English) is an item of office furniture for storing paper documents in file folders. In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which articles are stored. The two most common forms of filing cabinets are vertical files and lateral files. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically ) of the cabinet. A lateral file cabinet has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also shelf files which go on shelves. In the United States, file cabinets are usually built to accommodate 8.5 × 11 paper, and in other countries, filing cabinets are often designed to hold other sizes of paper, such as A4 paper.

==Construction==
Office filing cabinets are typically made of sheet metal or wood. The drawers usually use a drawer slide to facilitate opening the drawer which includes an &quot;outstop&quot; to prevent the drawer from being pulled completely out of the cabinet. To open a drawer on most metal filing cabinets, a small sliding mechanism known as a &quot;thumblatch&quot; must be pressed to release and open the drawer. Each drawer has a handle to grip and pull the drawer with. On the front face of each drawer, there is usually a label holder to allow the user to identify the contents of the drawer.

Many file cabinets incorporate a keyed lock to prevent unauthorized access to the documents being stored. There are two types of locks. A &quot;cam lock&quot; is activated with a key that rotates the lock. A &quot;plunger lock&quot; is opened with a key but can be closed by merely depressing the body of the lock. The plunger lock allows a user to quickly close and lock several cabinets in a short amount of time.

Some file cabinets have a metal plate or wire structure at the back of each drawer which is known as a follower block. The follower block can be adjusted forward to reduce the length of the drawer so that the file folders contained within remain upright and at the front of the drawer for easier access.

==Horizontal file==
Henry Brown, an American inventor, patented a &quot;receptacle for storing and preserving papers&quot; on November 2, 1886. This was a fire and accident safe container made of forged metal, which could be sealed with a lock. It was special in that it kept the papers separated.

==Vertical file==

The invention of the vertical file remains an unsolved mystery. The Vertical Filing Cabinet section in the Early Office Museum website begins with a discussion of the erroneous conclusions by highly credentialed “secondary sources&quot;, concerning the origin of vertical filing. The secondary sources claimed that a gold medal was presented at the World’s Fair of 1893 for a vertical file. The Early Office Museum found no evidence to substantiate those claims. Nevertheless, the information presented in the Early Office Museum’s discussion of vertical filing cabinets suggests that the commercial introduction of vertical filing may have occurred in 1900 when a company named the Library Bureau (founded in 1876, later a division of Remington Rand) published a catalog that included a vertical filing cabinet. A US patent was filed in 1902 by the Library Bureau that credited David E. Hunter as the inventor.

Research by Ester Ellen-Poe validated The Early Office Museum&#x27;s findings, and suggests that the most credible claim to the invention of vertical filing, as we know it today, appears to have been by the Library Bureau. The Library Bureau’s 1903 pamphlet titled &quot;Library Bureau Systems of Vertical Filing with Interchangeable Unit Cabinets&quot;, begins with: &quot;Vertical filing, as originated [emphasis added] and perfected by the Library Bureau, is the most complete, accurate and practical method ever invented [emphasis added] for taking care of correspondence, catalogs, reports, invoices, orders, duplicate bills, and loose sheets, or papers of any kind for any business—large, small or peculiar.&quot;).

In addition to the Library Bureau, early manufacturers of vertical filing cabinets included Globe-Wernicke, Yawman and Erbe Manufacturing Company, and the Art Metal Construction Company.

Prior to the introduction of commercial vertical filing cabinets businesses kept papers in envelopes in turn stored in arrays of pigeonholes often lining a wall. Finding and opening envelopes and unfolding papers was troublesome and inefficient. However, the concept of vertical filing was clearly practiced as early as 1895 when a U.S. patent (533053) was issued to W.A. Cooke, Jr. for A Receptacle for Letters or Other Papers.

After World War II, the Home-O-Nize Company was established in Muscatine, Iowa to provide returning veterans with jobs. Founded to produce steel kitchen cabinets, the company soon encountered the reality of the limited availability of steel. So the company began to make products for others. Finally a small amount of steel was secured and the company started manufacturing steel index card boxes. Soon after, larger cabinets began to be produced including filing cabinets. By designing to minimize the amount of steel, the product was an extremely cost-effective design and had huge commercial success. Home-O-Nize never did make kitchen cabinets and in 1961, the company name was changed to HON. Today, The HON Company, a division of HNI Corporation is the predominant North American manufacturer and marketer of filing cabinets.

The demand for filing cabinets was greatly expanded as a result of the commercial distribution of Xerography machines starting in 1950. This event enabled office workers to &quot;have their own copy&quot; of printed materials. Another influence is the expansion of government regulations that require businesses to create and keep forms and other documents. Some prognosticators have suggested the future of the filing cabinet is in doubt as electronic filing systems proliferate and become lower in cost. Nevertheless, most businesses are still purchasing computer systems with printing capabilities. Unless this trend is reversed, filing of paper is still a viable practice.

In the US, these come in two sizes: for letter-size paper and legal-size paper. Most modern commercially oriented vertical filing cabinets in the US are manufactured in two-, three-, four-, and five-drawer versions in depths of . The drawers are typically supported on a three-member suspension system that allows the drawer to be fully extended for complete access.

The four-drawer vertical file, letter width, is the version purchased by most businesses. The two-drawer file is sold mostly for use alongside a desk. The five-drawer file is mostly purchased by Federal, State, and Local governments (in a version), as it typically provides the lowest cost per filing inch. Three drawer files, the least popular version, have the advantage of being at &quot;countertop&quot; height so end users can easily retrieve files and use the top of the cabinet as a work area to examine file contents.

The drawers of most vertical filing cabinets are engineered to accept hanging file folders, as these have come to dominate the way most users store information. Some files still have a &quot;follower block&quot; in each drawer. This is a device that adjusts the apparent depth of the drawer interior so that files are kept upright in the drawer. These are the legacy of a time when most filing was done with manila folders rather than hanging files.

For home offices or lighter use applications, vertical files are manufactured in versions. These typically have two-member suspensions and the drawers do not fully extend.

==Lateral file==
Lateral files are typically deep and manufactured in widths and 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer versions. The , two-drawer version is popular for use inside cubicle workstations, as it is engineered to fit under or alongside the cubicle work surfaces. Logic for the use of 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer files is similar to that of vertical files. Unlike vertical files, most lateral files allow for side-to-side or front-to-back filing.

For letter-size files arranged front-to-back, the files are the most effective, as the maximum amount of filing per cabinet is enabled. A file, with letter-width filing front-to-back has no more capacity than a corresponding file, as the additional space would be wasted.

Some users prefer side-to-side filing, as they can search index tabs from a seated position. All-width lateral files can accommodate this configuration, though the capacity of the file is somewhat diminished.

An advantage for lateral files is that access and view of all files can be easier than with a vertical file because the drawers do not extend as far.

In most instances, the top &quot;5th drawer&quot; of a five-drawer lateral file is a flipper door with pull-out shelf, as most people would not be able to access the top of a drawer at this height.

==Shelf file==
A shelf file is a cabinet designed to accommodate folders with tabs on the side rather than on the top. The cabinet has no drawers, only shelves. Some shelf files come with doors that recede into the cabinet. These cabinets are typically or deep, for letter or legal size folders respectively. Like lateral files, they are made in , , , and widths but are usually only installed in 5-high and 6-high applications.

Side tabbed files often use color codes that represent an alpha-numeric filing system. This methodology is a way to ensure files which are frequently retrieved and returned are easy to find and do not get lost. Finding a file is easy as to color-coded tabs easily lead the human eye to the appropriate location in the filing system. Similarly, a misfiled folder is obvious as an out-of-sequence color code is obvious to the user.

Businesses such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, police, and government agencies use shelf files and end-tabbed folders to manage large filing systems.

Variations on traditional shelf files, designed to offer increased capacity for a given floor area, include Rotary Storage systems.

== Specifications ==
Within the United States, the primary standard for vertical filing cabinets is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer&#x27;s Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. BIFMA used to maintain a separate Standard X5.2 for lateral filing cabinets, but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel filing cabinets, A-A-3186
and A-A-3187
respectively. The GSA standards define two grades of filing cabinets, medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for filing cabinets and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject may be found in the article on classified information in the United States.

In the United Kingdom the dimensions and certain aspects of rigidity, construction, and safety are covered by BS 4438:1969 and BS EN 14073-2:2004. The safety standards revolve particularly against stability with drawers fully open. Interlocking mechanisms to prevent opening two drawers at once are not mandatory, but the employer&#x27;s responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act makes them advisable. In other EU states the EN 14073-2:2004 harmonised standard will be endorsed by the relevant standards agency, such as DIN in Germany.

In Australia filing cabinets should be to AS 5079 a modified version of &quot;ANSI BIFMA X5.2-1997&quot;.

==Filing outside the US==
Non-US firms offer filing cabinets that permit A4 paper to be used in addition to letter-size. Double file cabinets have drawers which can each accommodate two racks for folders side by side.

Many European companies engineer filing systems that accommodate hanging folders only; there are no drawer bottoms. In the US, most file drawers still have bottoms in the drawers so materials of any sort can be stored.

UK filing cabinets are slightly different from US in the width of the rails which support the suspension files, the US ones being narrower; the UK sizes are known as A4, foolscap and A3.

==Decline==
As some offices have tended towards paperless operation - i.e. storing more and more information on computers, rather than on paper - filing cabinets, and indeed other office furniture for long-term archival storage, have been less in demand.

== Benefits of a filing cabinet ==
Filing cabinets are important in modern offices because offices have to deal with large volumes of paperwork and files on a daily basis.

* File cabinets are the most reliable way to store important paper documents.
* File cabinets save time and energy during work by offering files and papers stored in a designated place.
* The file cabinet is a useful tool for any office as paper used clutter desks and other places.
* Filing cabinets reduce the chance to loss of company information and papers.

<text>Edwin Grenville Seibels (September 12, 1866 – December 21, 1954) was the inventor in 1898 of the vertical filing system that has been in extensive use for over a century. Although he applied for a patent for his system, it was denied on the ground that it was only an idea, not a device.

He was born in Columbia, South Carolina, grew up in Mount Willing, the family cotton plantation in Edgefield County, now Saluda County and went to work in the family&#x27;s Columbia-based insurance business, E. W. Seibels and Son (now the Seibels Bruce Group) in 1882 at age 16 while attending South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) from which he graduated in 1885. While a student there he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa and the Clariosophic Society. In 1909 he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives. His knowledge of cotton family helped him to become successful in exporting and insuring cotton.

<doc id="1117386" wikidata="Q1148336" url="?curid=1117386" title="International Standard Recording Code">
<text>The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is an international standard code for uniquely identifying sound recordings and music video recordings. The code was developed by the recording industry in conjunction with the ISO technical committee 46, subcommittee 9 (TC 46/SC 9), which codified the standard as ISO 3901 in 1986, and updated it in 2001.

An ISRC identifies a particular &quot;recording&quot;, not the work (composition and lyrical content) itself. Therefore, different recordings, edits, and remixes of the same work should each have their own ISRC. Works are identified by ISWC. Recordings remastered or revised in other ways are usually assigned a new ISRC.

== History ==

ISO 3901 was completed in 1986. In 1988, the IFPI recommended that its member companies adopt ISRCs for music videos. In 1989, the ISO designated the IFPI as the registration authority for ISRCs. The IFPI, in turn, delegated part of the administration of ISRCs to several dozen national agencies, which allocate ISRCs to both record companies and individuals. The national agencies began assigning ISRCs for music videos in August 1989.

The Japanese recording industry began encoding ISRCs on audio CDs in November 1989. The IFPI and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) then developed detailed recommendations for this practice, and for ISRC assignment in general. The IFPI adopted the recommendations in March 1991 and they went into effect for IFPI members on 1 January 1992.

== Format ==
ISRC codes are always 12 characters long, in the form &quot;CC-XXX-YY-NNNNN&quot;. The hyphens are not part of the ISRC code itself, but codes are often presented that way in print to make them easier to read. The four parts are as follows:

* &quot;CC&quot; is the appropriate two-character country code for the ISRC issuer. The code is assigned according to the ISO 3166-1-Alpha-2 standard. (High demand for ISRCs within the United States has caused the supply of available registrant codes to become exhausted; after December 6, 2010, new registrants in the US use country code &quot;QM, QZ, or QT&quot;. The codes &quot;CP&quot; and &quot;DG&quot; are reserved for further overflow, and &quot;ZZ&quot; is reserved for codes assigned by the International ISRC Agency. Further additions continue to be made.)
* &quot;XXX&quot; is a three character alphanumeric registrant code of the ISRC issuer. This code by itself does NOT uniquely identify the ISRC issuer as the same 3-digit registrant code may be used in various countries for different issuers. To uniquely identify an issuer, the country code and registrant code must be used together.
* &quot;YY&quot; represent the last two digits of the reference year – the year that the ISRC was assigned to the recording. This is not necessarily the date the recording was made.
* &quot;NNNNN&quot; is a 5-digit number that identifies the particular sound or video recording, unique within the scope of the reference year.

Example:

A recording of the song &quot;Monkeys Spinning Monkeys&quot; by American composer Kevin MacLeod has been allocated the ISRC code USUAN1400011:

* US for United States
* UAN for Incompetech
* 14 for 2014
* 00011 as the unique id identifying this particular recording

== Embedding ISRC in files ==
ISRC may be embedded in most file formats as metadata. Example formats include MP3, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, and WAV for audio and MP4, M4V, or MKV for video.
* The standard for the ID3v2.2 tag that was designed for use in MP3 files, was published in March 2019 and defined a way to embed ISRCs in a &#x27;TSRC&#x27; frame.
* In August 2020, Barry Grint and the European Broadcasting Union published a specification for embedding ISRCs in Broadcast Wave Format, a WAV-with-metadata format.
* Audio CDs defined by the Red Book may also embed ISRC as part of the CD-Text information.

Metadata formats are not generally interchangeable as format converters may fail to translate the data. As a result, it is recommended to perform the embedding separately for each format.

==Obtaining ISRCs==
The provision of ISRCs is overseen by appointed national ISRC agencies. These national ISRC agencies issue codes directly to the public and may also utilize authorized ISRC Managers to issue ISRCs. In the United States, the appointed agency is RIAA. ISRC codes can be obtained in large blocks directly from RIAA for an administrative fee ($95 at time of this publication), in quantities as little as 1 from ISRC.com ($2-$5), or in conjunction with other music-related services from other authorized ISRC managers. In territories where there is no national ISRC agency, users can obtain ISRC codes directly from IFPI or from ISRC.com, Quansic and Sound Credit.

<doc id="1117388" wikidata="Q2657780" url="?curid=1117388" title="Amatuni">
<text>The House of Amatuni () is an ancient Armenian noble family, known from the 4th century in the canton of Artaz, between lakes Van and Urmia, with its center at Shavarshan (latter-day Maku), and subsequently also at Aragatsotn, west of Lake Sevan, with the residence at Oshakan.

== Medieval dynasty ==
The Amatuni who was of Caspio-Median or Matianian-Mannaean origin, is given a specious Jewish ancestry from descendants of Samson by the early Armenian tradition (&quot;Moses of Chorene 2.57&quot;). Their forefather&#x27;s name &quot;Manue&quot; suggests a possible connection with the royal Assyrian house of Adiabene. They were variously attributed a descent from Astyages of Media and a Hebrew descent. Also, Armenian princely family of Amatuni believed to be descendants of the kings (chieftains) of the Matienian tribes 

In addition, in Antiquity besides its original land of Artaz, the Principality of Amatuniq also included in addition the district of the Djur-shrod (Chuash-rot) with the center in the town of Myarakan, located along the river Araxes, southeast of Artaz.
Apparently, starting from 336 A.D. the Amatuni princes were in charge of the tax service of the Armenian kingdom, when the Arshakids bestowed on them the fortress and possession of Oshakan in the heart of their Ayrarat royal domain, not far from the capital of the kingdom Dvin(&quot;Moses of Chorene 2.57&quot;). Historians described the battle that took place in 336 near Oshakan, between Armenians and Persians, in which Armenians won. For his valor in the liberation wars, in 336, the Armenian king Khosrov III presented Oshakan to Vahan Amatuni. During the wars, the Amatuni sent their Suzerain (overlord), the king of Armenia, 500 horses and cavalry soldiers, which shows the political weight and military potential of this grand princely family. . 
At the initiative of the princes Amatuni, Mesrop Mashtots, the creator of the Armenian alphabet, was buried here. As Nakharars the Amatuni owned Oshakan until 773, after which these lands came under the control of the Bagratids.

After the Sassanids of Iran abolished the Arsacid monarchy in Armenia in 428, Vahan (II) Amatuni was appointed by the Great King as assistant governor to the Iranian marzpan. However, Sassanid propagation of Zoroastrianism among the Christian Armenians caused the reversal of the Amatuni&#x27;s loyalty and, in 451, Vahan revolted, only to be banished to Gorgan. In 451, the famous Battle of Avarayr between Armenians and Persians took place in Artaz, south of Maku.

The transfer of regional power from the Sassanids to Muslim Arab rule provoked a large-scale aristocratic insurrection of 774-75.

In the 9th century, when kingdom of Great Armenia was restored, Amatuni still remained in the possession of Artaz, but under the Artsruni of Vaspurakan, until 909, when the Vaspurakan kingdom of the Artsrunis separated from the kingdom of Great Armenia, but Artaz remained loyal to the united Armenian kingdom of the Bagratids and remained part of it. 
Also, the principality of Amatuni (Artaz) has always had its own separate church diocese, the diocese of Amatuniq. The Vachutean genealogy was reconstructed by Marie Brosset and can be found in his &quot;Rapports sur un voyage archéologique dans la Géorgie et dans l&#x27;Arménie&quot; (St. Petersburg 1849-1851) III: 99-100.

The Artazian branch of Amatuni family was ruling castle of Maku (Shavarshan) stil in XVth century and successfully defend it during Timurleng invasion, when he besieged castle of Maku, as was stated in his book by Castilian diplomat don Ruy González de Clavijo, when he was traveling to the imperial court of emir Timurleng in Samarkand.

A branch of the family still controlled a fiefdom of Artaz in Maku down to the 1500s when Ottomans and Kurdish tribes toppled Armenian rule in the region. while the branch which ruled Hamamshen was overthrown in the 15th century after the Ottomans invaded the empire of Trebizond and exiled its last prince Baron David II to Ispir.

== Later family ==

After the Middle Ages the Amatuni family disappeared. In the 17th century, one of the representatives of the Amatuni clan, a certain Azarbek I Amatuni, son of Prince George Amatuni, was a melik of the city of Nakhichevan-on-Arax. Melik Azarbek I had sons George, Petros (Peter) and Vahan, who faithfully served with their father the Iranian shah. The children and grandchildren of one of the sons, Peter Azarbekyan Amatuni, moved to the city of Tiflis, where on January 1, 1784, King Irakli II confirmed Sarkis (Sergey) Petrovich Azaryan-Amatuni with his sons Stepan, Karapet, Gregory and his nephew Yakov Ivanovich Amatuni, they were in charge of the dignity of their ancestors, &quot;who were at the time of the Armenian kings, the resplendent princes.&quot; At the same time, the coat of arms was approved by the charter of the Georgian king Heraclius II of January 1, 1784.
Another branch of the Amatuni clan, descendants of Allahverdi khan Amatuni, were meliks in Karadagh (Arasbaran) until 1918; and also, they were on the board of directors of oil companies of Baku until 1917. After the Russian annexation of Georgia, the family was confirmed in the dignity of Knyaz on March 25, 1826.

<text>Ayrarat () was the central province of the ancient kingdom of Armenia, located in the plain of the upper Aras River. Most of the historical capitals of Armenia were located in this province, including Armavir, Yervandashat, Artashat, Vagharshapat, Dvin, Bagaran, Shirakavan, Kars and Ani (the current capital of Armenia, Yerevan, is also located on the territory of historical Ayrarat). 

== Name ==
The name is clearly connected with Uruatri/Urartu and the biblical Ararat, and perhaps also with the Alarodians mentioned by Herodotus. It is not used by any of the classical Greek and Roman authors who write about Armenia, which suggests that it was a purely local name used to refer to the central lands of Armenia. Robert H. Hewsen does not rule out the possibility that Armenians applied the name to the great plain surrounding Mount Masis after converting to Christianity in the early fourth century and identifying the biblical Ararat with Masis. If this is the case, then Ayrarat may be identical with the (&quot;Araxes plain&quot;) mentioned by Strabo.

The ultimate etymology of the names Urartu, Ayrarat, and Ararat is not known for certain. In the Armenian tradition, Ayrarat and the Ararat plain are associated with the legendary Armenian king Ara the Handsome.

The province is also referred to in Armenian sources as the (&quot;central province of Armenia&quot;) or as the (&quot;head province of Armenia&quot;). During the Arsacid period, Ayrarat referred to, in its narrowest sense, the royal domain consisting of the Ararat plain and its adjacent districts. The author of the seventh-century geography &quot;Ashkharhatsʻoytsʻ&quot; used the term Ayrarat to refer to a much larger territory. The name Ayrarat gradually fell out of use after the fall of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia and the conquest of Armenia by the Seljuks in the eleventh century.

== Districts ==

The seventh-century &quot;Ashkharhatsʻoytsʻ&quot; attributed to Anania Shirakatsi depicts Ayrarat as a very large province with 22 districts, but this is probably based on the new administrative divisions created after the Byzantine-Persian partition of Armenia in 591.

<doc id="1117392" wikidata="Q2553232" url="?curid=1117392" title="Exit status">
<text>In computing, the exit status (also exit code or exit value) of a terminated process is an integer number that is made available to its parent process (or caller). In DOS, this may be referred to as an errorlevel.

When computer programs are executed, the operating system creates an abstract entity called a process in which the book-keeping for that program is maintained. In multitasking operating systems such as Unix or Linux, new processes can be created by active processes. The process that spawns another is called a &quot;parent process&quot;, while those created are &quot;child processes&quot;. Child processes run concurrently with the parent process. The technique of spawning child processes is used to delegate some work to a child process when there is no reason to stop the execution of the parent. When the child finishes executing, it exits by calling the &quot;exit&quot; system call. This system call facilitates passing the exit status code back to the parent, which can retrieve this value using the &quot;wait&quot; system call.

==Semantics==
The parent and the child can have an understanding about the meaning of the exit statuses. For example, it is common programming practice for a child process to return (exit with) zero to the parent signifying success. Apart from this return value from the child, other information like how the process exited, either normally or by a signal may also be available to the parent process.

The specific set of codes returned is unique to the program that sets it. Typically it indicates success or failure. The value of the code returned by the function or program may indicate a specific cause of failure. On many systems, the higher the value, the more severe the cause of the error. Alternatively, each bit may indicate a different condition, with these being evaluated by the &quot;or&quot; operator together to give the final value; for example, fsck does this.

Sometimes, if the codes are designed with this purpose in mind, they can be used directly as a branch index upon return to the initiating program to avoid additional tests.

===AmigaOS===
In AmigaOS, MorphOS and AROS, four levels are defined:
* OK 0
* WARN 5
* ERROR 10
* FAILURE 20

===Shell and scripts===
Shell scripts typically execute commands and capture their exit statuses.

For the shell&#x27;s purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. A nonzero exit status indicates failure. This seemingly counter-intuitive scheme is used so there is one well-defined way to indicate success and a variety of ways to indicate various failure modes. When a command is terminated by a signal whose number is N, a shell sets the variable $? to a value greater than 128. Most shells use 128+N, while ksh93 uses 256+N.

If a command is not found, the shell should return a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable, the return status should be 126. Note that this is not the case for all shells.

If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.

===C language===
The C programming language allows programs exiting or returning from the main function to signal success or failure by returning an integer, or returning the macros codice_1 and codice_2. On Unix-like systems these are equal to 0 and 1 respectively. A C program may also use the codice_3 function specifying the integer status or exit macro as the first parameter.

The return value from codice_4 is passed to the codice_5 function, which for values zero, codice_1 or codice_2 may translate it to &quot;an implementation defined form&quot; of &quot;successful termination&quot; or &quot;unsuccessful termination&quot;.

Apart from zero and the macros codice_1 and codice_2, the C standard does not define the meaning of return codes. Rules for the use of return codes vary on different platforms (see the platform-specific sections).

===DOS===
In DOS terminology, an errorlevel is an integer exit code returned by an executable program or subroutine. Errorlevels typically range from 0 to 255. In DOS there are only 256 error codes available, but DR DOS 6.0 and higher support 16-bit error codes at least in CONFIG.SYS. With 4DOS and DR-DOS COMMAND.COM, exit codes (in batchjobs) can be set by EXIT &quot;n&quot; and (in CONFIG.SYS) through ERROR=&quot;n&quot;.

Exit statuses are often captured by batch programs through IF ERRORLEVEL commands. Multiuser DOS supports a reserved environment variable %ERRORLVL% which gets automatically updated on return from applications. COMMAND.COM under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher supports a similar pseudo-environment variable %ERRORLVL% as well as %ERRORLEVEL%. In CONFIG.SYS, DR DOS 6.0 and higher supports ONERROR to test the load status and return code of device drivers and the exit code of programs.

===Java===
In Java, any method can call codice_10, unless a security manager does not permit it. This will terminate the currently running Java Virtual Machine. &quot;The argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status code indicates abnormal termination.&quot;

===OpenVMS===
In OpenVMS, success is indicated by odd values and failure by even values. The value is a 32-bit integer with sub-fields: control bits, facility number, message number and severity. Severity values are divided between success (Success, Informational) and failure (Warning, Error, Fatal).

===Plan 9===
In Plan 9&#x27;s C, exit status is indicated by a string passed to the &quot;exits&quot; function, and function main is type void.

===POSIX===
In Unix and other POSIX-compatible systems, the parent process can retrieve the exit status of a child process using the codice_11 family of system calls defined in wait.h. Of these, the codice_12 call retrieves the full exit status, but the older codice_13 and codice_14 calls retrieve only the least significant 8 bits of the exit status.

The codice_13 and codice_14 interfaces set a &quot;status&quot; value of type codice_17 packed as a bitfield with various types of child termination information. If the child terminated by exiting (as determined by the codice_18 macro; the usual alternative being that it died from an uncaught signal), SUS specifies that the low-order 8 bits of the exit status can be retrieved from the status value using the codice_19 macro.

In the codice_12 system call (added with SUSv1), the child exit status and other information are no longer in a bitfield but in the structure of type codice_21.

POSIX-compatible systems typically use a convention of zero for success and nonzero for error. Some conventions have developed as to the relative meanings of various error codes; for example GNU recommend that codes with the high bit set be reserved for serious errors.

BSD-derived OS&#x27;s have defined an extensive set of preferred interpretations: Meanings for 15 status codes 64 through 78 are defined in sysexits.h. These historically derive from sendmail and other message transfer agents, but they have since found use in many other programs. It has been deprecated and its use is discouraged.

The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide has some information on the meaning of non-0 exit status codes.

===Windows===
Microsoft Windows uses 32-bit unsigned integers as exit codes, although the command interpreter treats them as signed.

Exit codes are directly referenced, for example, by the command line interpreter CMD.exe in the codice_22 terminology inherited from DOS. The .NET Framework processes and the Windows PowerShell refer to it as the codice_23 property of the codice_24 object.

<doc id="1117402" wikidata="Q2669531" url="?curid=1117402" title="The Vicar of Nibbleswicke">
<text>The Vicar of Nibbleswicke is a children&#x27;s story written by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake. It was first published in 1991, after Dahl&#x27;s death the previous year, by Century. 

The protagonist is a dyslexic vicar, the Reverend Lee, who has a unique and amusing form of dyslexia which means that he pronounces words backwards, not realising that it is affecting his sermons. Waterstones called it &quot;a comic tale in the best Dahl tradition of craziness&quot;. 

Prior to the book, Dahl had been assisting with the British Dyslexia Association&#x27;s Awareness Campaign. &quot;The Vicar of Nibbleswicke&quot; was written to benefit the Dyslexia Institute in London (now Dyslexia Action), with Dahl and Blake donating their rights.

==Summary==

The Reverend Robert Lee, the new vicar of Nibbleswicke, had, with the help of teachers at the Dyslexia Institute in London, overcome his childhood issues with reading and had become a success in his school and seminary. However, now in his first parish, his nerves cause him to suffer from a rare and acutely embarrassing condition: Back-to-Front Dyslexia, a fictional type of dyslexia that causes the subject to say the most important word (often being the verb) in a sentence backwards, creating comedic situations. For example, instead of saying &quot;knits&quot;, he will say &quot;stink&quot;; &quot;God&quot; would be &quot;dog&quot; etc. It affects only his speech, and he doesn&#x27;t realize he&#x27;s doing it, but the parishioners of Nibbleswicke are shocked and confused by his seemingly inappropriate comments, especially the church&#x27;s most generous benefactor, Miss Arabella Prewt, who does not take kindly to being called &#x27;Miss Twerp&#x27;. However, thanks to the local doctor, a cure is found (walking backwards everywhere for the rest of his life), and the mild-mannered vicar can resume normal service.

The book contains a reference to Dahl&#x27;s previous novel &quot;Esio Trot&quot;, noting that its title is &quot;tortoise&quot; backwards—the doctor who diagnoses the Reverend’s new dyslexia claims that it is very common among tortoises who call themselves esio trots.

<text>The goliath frog (Conraua goliath), otherwise known commonly as the giant slippery frog and the goliath bullfrog, is a species of frog in the family Conrauidae. The goliath frog is the largest living frog. Specimens can reach up to about in snout–vent length and in weight. This species has a relatively small habitat range in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. Its numbers are dwindling due to habitat destruction, collection for food, and the pet trade.

== Description ==
The male and female are very similar. In a sample of 15 individuals, weights ranged between , and snout–vent lengths were between . In total length, including outstretched legs, the largest specimens can slightly exceed . The heaviest verified specimen, caught in the Muni River system in 1960, weighed and had a snout–vent length of . The longest verified specimen, caught in the same river system in 1966, weighed and had a snout–vent length of . There are unverified claims of considerably larger specimens, but they are dubious. Their eyes can be nearly in diameter. The conspicuous tympanum has a diameter around and is separated from the eye by about in adults. Goliath frog eggs and tadpoles are about the same size as other frogs despite their very large adult form.

A lateral fold extends from the eye to the posterior portion of the tympanum. Their toes are fully webbed, with large interdigital membranes extending down to the toe tips. The second toe is the longest. The skin on the dorsum and on top of the limbs is granular. Dorsal coloration is green sienna, while the abdomen and ventral part of the limbs are yellow/orange. They have acute hearing, but no vocal sac, and also lack nuptial pads.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The goliath frog is mainly found near waterfalls in Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon. Their habitat is divided into two main seasons: the dry season which occurs from November to April and the rainy season which occurs from May to October.

Due to its large size, the goliath frog has an extremely selective distribution. This species is primarily located in a dense equatorial forest fringe which is somewhat parallel to the coast and surrounded by rivers. The goliath frog has been located in Sanaga Basin (mainly appearing near the Nachtigal cascades and in the Sakbayeme rapids), Kienke Basin, Ntem Basin (mainly being located near the rapids of the Mensolo and Nsana), and Mbía Basin (where it was found to be very abundant in the rapids and cascades). These distribution patterns emphasize its limited environment which tends to have a clear preference for water territories.

==Conservation==

The primary threat to the goliath frog is hunting, as it is considered a food source in its native range. The IUCN has highlighted the need for conservation measures, in cooperation with local communities, to ensure hunting occurs at sustainable levels. To a lesser extent, they are also threatened by habitat loss and degradation. They have been extensively exported to zoos and the pet trade, but have proven shy and nervous in captivity. Although captives may live longer than their wild counterparts, the species has not been bred in captivity. Due to their classification as an endangered species, the Equatorial Guinean government has declared that no more than 300 goliath frogs may be exported per year for the pet trade, but few now seem to be exported from this country.

== Diet ==
It was determined in a study that the goliath frog consumes a wide variety of food, suggesting that the frog is omnivorous with a carnivorous preference. Their prey are terrestrial, aquatic, and semi-aquatic, indicating that they hunt both on land and in water. Food preferences were different among the different weight groups of frogs, possibly correlating to different stages of development. Frogs weighing less than consumed annelids, arachnids, myriapods, insects, crustaceans, gastropods, and reptiles. Frogs weighing more than consumed arachnids, myriapods, insects, crustaceans, and gastropods with a significantly higher occurrence of myriapods. Annelids and reptiles were present only in the diet of lower weight frogs, emphasizing a more diversified diet for younger goliath frogs. Fully developed frogs are also believed to prey on fish, small mammals, and smaller frogs.

== Reproduction==
Like most amphibians, water is vital for their reproduction. Because the goliath frog lacks a vocal sac, it does not produce mating calls, a behavior generally present in frogs and toads. The egg masses consist of several hundred to a few thousand eggs, approximately each, and often attached to aquatic vegetation. Goliath frogs have been observed to create three main nest types, all semi-circular in shape and located in or near a river. The first type of nest is constructed by clearing a section in an existing river pool. The second is constructed by expand an already existing pool, damming it off from the river. The third is constructed by digging a new pool roughly wide and deep, sometimes moving quite large stones in the process. This may partially explain the goliath frog&#x27;s large size, as larger frogs may be more successful at moving heavy objects when constructing their nests. Adults have also been shown to guard the nests at night. Although not confirmed, there are indications that the nest is constructed by the male, while the female guards the nest with the eggs. Larval development takes between 85 and 95 days.

== Life cycle == 

=== Longevity ===
The goliath frog can live up to 15 years in the wild and up to 21 years in captivity. Due to its large size, Goliath frogs are only known to be preyed on by humans although other predators are possible.

===Developmental Stages=== 

While the reproductive behavior for this species is mostly not well-known, studies by Lamotte, Perret, and Zahl have allowed an overall chronological table of larval development to be created. Typically after 24 hours, the cover of the egg mass becomes yellow and the eggs become dark gray-brown. These egg masses were found attached to the bottom of plants. 

First Month: no organs were differentiated and only the ocular region showed significant pigmentation and transparent external gills. The lengths were and while the body/tail appeared to be slightly pigmented, the abdomen was always nearly white. 

Second Month: The activity of the tadpoles increased greatly for they are now beginning to feed on leaves. Furthermore, they have developed a denser pigmentation, and the spiraculum and anal tube are now beginning to become visible. Additionally, the mouth and the eyes are beginning to function. Sizes range . As the month continues, pigmentation is becoming more intense via the presence of nearly black spots, two rows of teeth are developing on both the upper and lower lip, feeding increases greatly, and their size becomes .

Third Month: The posterior legs are now beginning to form and the length of the tadpoles are around 40mm. As the month progresses, the posterior legs become larger and joints/fingers are becoming more distinguishable. The total length of the tadpoles is now 45 mm. Finally, at the end of the month, anterior legs have fully appeared, posterior legs are grown with long and powerful fingers accompanying this growth, the mouth has become an arched slot line, tail regression has begun, and these tadpoles begin to put their head out of the water in order to breathe. 

Fourth Month: All of the specimens in the experiment reached the final stage of metamorphosis. The tail has been either completely or nearly reabsorbed, the shape and color of adults is obtained with slightly lighter and greener pigmentation, the total length is . The large size characteristic of these frogs is not obtained yet. The entire process of larval development takes approximately 85–95 days to complete. 

==Parental care==
=== Nesting patterns ===
The goliath frog creates nests as sites for their offspring as a form of parental care. There are three main types of nests: type 1 mainly contains rock pools that were cleared from detritus and leaf litter, type 2 contains existing washouts at riverbanks, and type 3 were depressions dug by the frogs into the gravel riverbanks. Each nest type contains advantages and disadvantages. Nest type 1 was the easiest to create since only cleaning of the substrate was required to create the nest. Consequently, these types of nests were the least reliable since they were usually positioned in the river bed which makes them extremely vulnerable to being washed out by the rising water levels and to having predators enter the nest. Both nest types 2 and 3 were less likely to be washed out, however, they have an increased risk for being dried-up during the dry season. Consequently, while each nest promotes clear advantages, nests are typically constructed depending on the environment cues (whether it is the dry season or the rainy season). All nest types can be used several times, and can consist of three distinct cohorts of tadpoles. The construction of these nests can also explain how the goliath frog became the largest frog. Digging out these nests which exceed 1 m in diameter is an extremely arduous task. Other species which perform this task are also quite large in size. This includes: male African Bullfrogs, Gladiator Frogs, and the Bornean Giant River Frog. 

Typically, the goliath frog attaches its eggs either underwater, in small groups to rocks, or in gravel or larger pieces of wood. The construction of the nests may help reduce predation for it would be more difficult for the fish and shrimp (species which typically eat the eggs) to find the eggs and it may prevent the eggs from being washed away by the rapid current. However, in contrast, the changing water levels may also cause an increase in predation, cause more of the eggs to spill out, and increase tadpole mortality as well since the tadpoles and eggs may remain trapped within the nests. Additionally, these nests allow the Goliath frogs to become less dependent on existing structures for egg deposition which can allow these frogs to prolong their breeding season and also increase the amount of suitable breeding sites (they are determined to be suitable by the absence of predators or water presence since water is required for the offspring to survive). The process of constructing a nest for the offspring is used as a method of promoting a male’s reproductive benefits to the females. It also serves as the main parental investment since once the female deposits the eggs after fertilization, there is no more parental investment. 

== Threats ==
===Parasites=== 
The goliath frog is endangered due to deforestation, overhunting, and parasites. One particular parasite is one species of microfilarial nematode which belongs to genus &quot;Icoseilla&quot;. This parasite is often found within the blood and lymphatic system and its spread throughout the lymphatic system can cause lethargy and mortality when the infection is serious. This parasite was more prevalent during the dry season which is primarily due to the water speed decreasing thereby allowing more potential breeding sites created. Since there are more breeding sites (it is important to note that their primary habitat is near rivers and waterfalls, but in the dry season, they tend to create breeding sites in areas that contain less water), there would be more opportunity for the mosquitos to infect the frogs thereby increasing the contagion rate. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship detected between host size and parasite abundance: the greater the size of the host, the more intense the infection would be. Within this species, male goliath frogs were found to be more significantly infected when compared to the females which can be due to the weight difference between the two. Additionally, as within most species, as age increases, the severity of the infection will also increase. 

===Helminth parasites===
There are also parasites that mainly target the gastro-intestinal tract of this frog. These parasites are called helminth parasites which are worm-like parasites divided into three main groups: flukes which are leaf-shaped flatworms, tapeworms which are elongated flatworms that inhabit extraintestinal tissues, and roundworms which inhabit intestinal and extraintestinal sites. The Goliath frog, however, was mainly infected by Nematodes (90.5%) which is a specific type of roundworm. The helminth species discovered within the Goliath frog was extremely similar to those discovered in amphibian hosts in other African countries emphasizing that its location/habitat is the main cause of the prevalence of this predator. However, the Goliath frog was also infected by the nymph of &quot;Sebekia sp&quot; which could be primarily due to these frogs sharing the same habitat of crocodiles (definitive host) and fishes (intermediate host). Frogs that originate in Loum and Yabassi which are places within Cameroon had the largest variety of helminth species whereas frogs from Nkondjock had the smallest variety. This could be explained by the difference in agricultural activities, deforestation, and poaching. Liver weight was examined to reveal that there is a higher accumulation of toxic products at Loum due to the significant increase in agriculture practice. Consequently, land use effects and their impact on water habitats plays a significant role in the pattern of parasitism and land use by goliath frogs. Additionally, the direct life cycles of the helminths may play an important role in species diversity. Parasites which have direct life cycles spend a majority of their adult life within one host which allows their offspring to be spread from one host to another. These types of parasites also often lack an intermediate stage which means that they must be able to survive in the outside environment as well and be able to establish themselves within a new host. This ability to adapt to new environments contributes greatly to the complexity of helminth communities of goliath frogs.

===Chytridiomycosis=== 

Chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease affecting amphibians, caused by the chytrid fungi &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot; and &quot;Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans.&quot; It has the capability to cause random deaths due to its high mortality rate. These fungi invade the surface layers of the skin, causing damage to the outer keratin layer. As the tadpole continues to grow, more keratin becomes present on the skin thereby allowing the fungus to spread to many parts of the body resulting in the death of the tadpole. Amphibian skin is vital because it is physiologically active meaning it plays important roles in regulating respiration, water, and electrolytes. While the method of how this fungus kills frogs is not known, it can be hypothesized that its invasion through the skin is related since it can cause an electrolyte depletion, osmotic imbalance, and make it more difficult for the frog to breathe. When infected with this fungus, a frog may have discolored skin, peeling on the outside layers of its skin, be sluggish, and have its legs spread slightly away from itself. This fungus is also transmittable since it can be directly transferred through contact between frogs and tadpoles or through exposure to infected water. Thus, it is highly spreadable and with its high mortality rate among frogs, it is extremely deadly.

== Physiology ==
The goliath frog contains extensive skin folds to promote respiratory gas exchange at high altitudes. Additionally, the lungs within these frogs are reduced to about one-third of the volume of other frogs and they also contain a smaller heart. This is primarily due to their difference in predation methods. Goliath frogs are typically sit-and-wait predators. This means that they tend to capture/trap their prey either by luring them or using elements of surprise by acting extremely stealthy. As a result, they have a reduced metabolic rate and a unique method of breathing. When attempting to breathe, each buccal movement (a method in which the mouth expands and contracts in order to promote the movement of air into the lungs) pumps air at a rapid rate and the process of getting the oxygen removed from the air is slightly more efficient in this species of frog. These adaptations are very useful for the production of territorial and reproductive calls created by these frogs. Typically, the call of the goliath frog which is produced by the frog opening its mouth is admitted at a high frequency of 4.4 kHz. Furthermore, the goliath frog does not contain a vocal sac which causes the process for making noises/calls for reproduction to be different than most frogs.
==Interactions with humans==

In addition to the impacts of climate change, agriculture, and deforestation, goliath frogs are also threatened by the local practice of hunting them for food. While hunting the frogs, locals will use lanterns to get their attention, then immobilize them using mesh nets. In Nkombia, they may also be captured with nets during the day while they are resting on rocks. However, this method of capture is not very effective, as they are able to jump high, thus easily escaping. Humans are the main predators of this species and the main cause of their endangerment. In order to save the species, hunting and environmental destruction should be limited.
