<text>Alexander &quot;Sawney&quot; Bean (sometimes also given as Sandy Bane, etc.) is a legendary figure, said to have been the head of a 45-member clan in Scotland in the 16th century that murdered and cannibalised over 1,000 people in 25 years. According to the legend, Bean and his clan members were eventually caught by a search party sent by King James VI, and were executed for their heinous crimes.

The story appeared in &quot;The Newgate Calendar&quot;, a sensationalised crime catalogue loosely connected with Newgate Prison in London. It has since passed into folklore and become a part of the Edinburgh tourism circuit.

==Legend==
According to &quot;The Newgate Calendar&quot;, a popular London publication of the 18th and 19th centuries, Alexander Bean was born in East Lothian during the 16th century. His father was a ditch-digger and hedge-trimmer; Bean tried to take up the family trade but quickly realised that he was not fit for the work.

He left home with an allegedly vicious woman named &#x27;Black&#x27; Agnes Douglas, who apparently shared his inclinations and was accused of being a witch. After some robbing and the cannibalisation of one of their victims, the couple ended up at a coastal cave in Bennane Head between Girvan and Ballantrae. The cave was deep and the entrance was blocked by water during high tide, enabling the couple to live there undiscovered for some 25 years.

The pair produced six daughters, eight sons, 14 granddaughters, and 18 grandsons. The grandchildren were said to be products of incest between their children.

Lacking the inclination for regular work, the Bean clan thrived by laying careful ambushes at night to rob and murder individuals or small groups. They brought the bodies back to their cave, where the corpses were dismembered and eaten. They would pickle the leftovers and discarded body parts in barrels; these leftovers would sometimes wash up on nearby beaches. This strategy helped conceal their crimes by leading villagers to believe that animals were responsible for the attacks on travellers.

The body parts and disappearances did not go unnoticed, but the clan stayed in their cave by day and took their victims at night. Thus, the villagers remained for a time unaware of the murderers living nearby.

Once local people began to take notice of the disappearances, searches were launched to find the culprits. One such took note of the cave, but the searchers did not believe any human could live in it. Frustrated and desperate for justice, the townspeople hanged several innocents, but the disappearances continued. Suspicion often fell on local innkeepers, since, in many cases, they were the last known to have seen the missing people alive.

One night, the Bean clan ambushed a married couple riding from a fayre on one horse. The man, trained in combat and armed with sword and pistol, was able to hold the clan off. The unfortunate wife was unhorsed, fell to the ground and was captured, meeting a hideous fate. The husband was rescued when a large group of fayre-goers appeared on the trail and the Beans fled. He was taken to the local magistrate, who was then informed of the events.

With the Beans&#x27; existence revealed, it was not long before the king (perhaps James VI of Scotland, in accounts linked to the 16th century, though this detail does not fit well with the story being linked to the 15th century) heard of the atrocities and led a posse of 400 men and several bloodhounds. The bloodhounds soon led them to the previously overlooked cave. Upon entering it by torchlight, the searchers found the Bean clan surrounded by human remains: body parts hanging from the walls, barrels filled with limbs, and piles of stolen heirlooms and jewellery.

There are two versions of the events following the Bean clan&#x27;s discovery. The more common is that the clan was captured alive, having given up without a fight. They were taken in chains to the Tolbooth Jail in Edinburgh, then transferred to either Leith or Glasgow, where they were summarily executed, being regarded as subhuman and unfit for trial. Sawney and the other men had their genitalia cut off and thrown into the fires, their hands and feet were severed, and they were allowed to bleed to death. Sawney shouted his dying words: &quot;It isn&#x27;t over, it will never be over&quot;. After watching the men die, Agnes, the other women and the children were tied to stakes and burned alive. These punishments recall—in essence if not in detail—the medieval hanging, drawing and quartering decreed for men convicted of treason; women convicted of the same would be burned. The second version is that the search party detonated gunpowder at the entrance of their cave, leaving the Bean clan to suffocate.

The town of Girvan, located near the macabre scene of murder and debauchery, has another legend about the Bean clan. It says that one of Bean&#x27;s daughters eventually left the clan and settled in Girvan where she planted a tree that became known as &quot;The Hairy Tree&quot;. After her family&#x27;s capture and exposure, her identity was revealed and angry locals hanged her from a bough of the Hairy Tree.

== Sources and veracity ==
There is debate over the validity of the Sawney Bean tale. Some assert that Sawney Bean was a real person, while others consider him a mythical figure. Dorothy L. Sayers offered a gruesome account of the tale in her fiction anthology &quot;Great Short Stories of Detection, Mystery and Horror&quot; (Gollancz, 1928). The book was a best-seller in Britain, and was reprinted seven times in the next five years. In a 2005 article, Sean Thomas notes that historical documents, such as newspapers and diaries during the era in which Sawney Bean was supposedly active, make no mention of ongoing disappearances of hundreds of people. Additionally, he notes inconsistencies in the stories, but speculates that kernels of truth might have inspired the legend. There are contradicting beliefs as to when the alleged atrocities occurred. Thomas explains that while many believe Sawney Bean&#x27;s campaign took place during the 16th century, others place it centuries earlier. Thomas also believes it likely that the legend was embellished and altered over time to make it more relevant to readers, and more salacious.

The Sawney Bean legend closely resembles the story of Christie Cleek, which is attested from the early 15th century. Christie Cleek is a mythical Scottish cannibal said to have lived during a famine in the mid-14th century.

The legend of Sawney Bean first appeared in British chapbooks (a type of printed street literature). Many today argue that the story served as political propaganda to denigrate the Scots after the Jacobite rebellions. Thomas disagrees, arguing: &quot;If the Sawney Bean story is to be read as deliberately anti-Scottish, how do we explain the equal emphasis on English criminals in the same publications? Wouldn&#x27;t such an approach rather blunt the point?&quot; (See also &quot;Sawney&quot; for this theory.)

A broadside from circa 1750 mentions &quot;the Scottish traditional story of Sandy Bane&quot; as it relates to a report of a murderer who had been eating live cats.

Another cannibal story from Scotland, even more redolent of the Sawney Bean tale than the Christie Cleek story, can be found in the 1696 work of Nathaniel Crouch, a compiler and popular-history writer who published under the pseudonym &quot;Richard Burton&quot;. He tells the following tale, which allegedly happened in 1459, the year before the death of James II of Scotland:

Hector Boece notes that the infant daughter of a Scottish brigand, who was executed with his family for cannibalism, though raised by foster parents, developed the cannibal appetite at 12, and was put to death for it. This was summarized by George M. Gould and Walter Pyle in &quot;Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine&quot;.

They are mostly evergreen though one species (&quot;E. glutinosa&quot;) is usually deciduous.

The leaves are opposite, and either simple or pinnate with 3-13 leaflets. The flowers are produced in late summer or autumn, are showy and sweetly scented, 3–6 cm diameter, with four creamy-white petals, and numerous stamens and styles. The fruit is a woody capsule 1-1.5 cm long containing several seeds, and maturing in 12–15 months.

== Etymology ==
The generic name &quot;Eucryphia&quot; is composed of two parts, namely &quot;eu-&quot; and &quot;-cryphia&quot;. The Greek ευ-κρυφαιος means well-covered and refers to the foliage, which is clustered towards the apex of branches.

==Species==
=== Extant species ===
*&quot;Eucryphia cordifolia&quot; – Valdivian temperate rain forests of southern Chile and Argentina. A tree growing up to 40 m tall; leaves simple, crenate to serrated, evergreen, 3–7 cm long. Its wood is used for construction, furniture and lumber, and its nectar for honey.
*&quot;Eucryphia glutinosa&quot; – Valdivian temperate rain forests of southern Chile. A large shrub to 7 m tall; leaves pinnate, with 3-5 leaflets, serrated, deciduous or semi-evergreen, 3–6 cm long.
*&quot;Eucryphia jinksii&quot; – subtropical New South Wales &amp; Queensland mountain rainforests endemic, Australia. A tree to 25 m tall; leaves simple or with 3 leaflets, entire, evergreen, 5–10 cm long (discovered 1994).
*&quot;Eucryphia lucida&quot; – Tasmania Australia. A tree to 20–30 m tall; leaves simple, entire, evergreen, 3–7 cm long. Common name is Tasmanian leatherwood and it is a major commercial source of monofloral honey.
*&quot;Eucryphia milliganii&quot; (syn. &quot;E. lucida&quot; var. &quot;milliganii&quot;). – Tasmania Australia. A tree to 6 m tall or more often a shrub; leaves simple, entire, evergreen, 1.5–3 cm long.
*&quot;Eucryphia moorei&quot; – New South Wales, Victoria temperate rainforests, Australia. Also known as pinkwood, eastern leatherwood or plumwood, is a tree to 30 m tall; leaves pinnate, with 7-15 leaflets, entire, evergreen, 6–12 cm long.
*&quot;Eucryphia wilkiei&quot; – Queensland wet tropics mountain top cloud forests endemic, Australia, is a large shrub. Discovered in Jan. 1970 by Jack (John H.) Wilkie.

=== Extinct species ===
*&quot;Eucryphia falcata&quot; (Late Palaeocene, Lake Bungarby)
*&quot;Eucryphia microstoma&quot; (Early Eocene, Regatta Point)
*&quot;Eucryphia aberensis&quot; (Middle to Late Eocene, Loch Aber).

=== Natural hybrids ===
There are two known natural hybrids, although additional, artificial hybrids have been created. However, these are not naturally occurring.
*&quot;Eucryphia × hybrida&quot; J.Bausch - natural hybrid of &quot;E. lucida&quot; and &quot;E. milliganii&quot; native to Tasmania
*&quot;Eucryphia × nymansensis&quot; J.Bausch - natural hybrid of &quot;E. cordifolia &quot; and &quot;E. glutinosa&quot; native to Chile

== Artificial hybrids and cultivars ==
(those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit)
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;intermedia&quot; (&quot;E. glutinosa&quot; × &quot;E. lucida&quot;)
**&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;intermedia&quot; &#x27;Rostrevor&#x27;
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;hillieri&quot; (&quot;E. moorei&quot; × &quot;E. lucida&quot;): Developed from a self-sown seedling at the nursery of Hillier &amp; Sons, Chandlers Ford in Hampshire around 1953.
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;nymansensis&quot; (&quot;E. cordifolia&quot; × &quot;E. glutinosa&quot;)
**&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;nymansensis&quot; &#x27;Nymansay&#x27; originated from Lt. Col. Leonard C.R. Messel&#x27;s garden at Nymans, Sussex (1913)
**&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;nymansensis&quot; &#x27;Nymans Silver&#x27; is a sport discovered at Nymans, Sussex in 2005. It is a variegated form with serrated oval leaves that are outlined in creamy white. It was discovered growing on a &quot;E.&quot; × &quot;nymansensis&quot; within the garden. It is considered to be faster growing and more columnar in nature. The name &#x27;Nymans Silver&#x27; was proposed by Philip Holmes, Deputy Head Gardener at Nymans.&#x27; 
*&quot;E.&quot; &#x27;Penwith&#x27; (&quot;E. cordifolia&quot; × &quot;E. lucida&quot;)
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;hybrida&quot; (&quot;E. glutinosa&quot; × &quot;E. lucida&quot;)

==Uses==
The species and their hybrids are attractive small trees for gardens, typically with a slender conic crown when young, though widening with age. They are valued for their conspicuous scented flowers, produced in late summer and autumn when few or no other trees are in flower. Cultivation is restricted to areas with mild winters, cool summers and good rainfall; away from their native areas, this restricts them to the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe, the Pacific Northwest of North America, and New Zealand.

===Honey===
The nectar of two of the species provides an important sources of honey. &quot;Eucryphia lucida&quot; from Tasmania is the main source of a very distinctively flavoured honey known as Leatherwood (the common name for the species). Some of this honey may come from the other Tasmanian species, &quot;E. milliganii&quot;. In Chile, Ulmo honey (again after the local species name) comes from &quot;E. cordifolia&quot;. Leatherwood honey and Ulmo honey are very similar in flavour, even though the two species have probably been separated for more than 45 million years.

<doc id="1145818" wikidata="Q985059" url="?curid=1145818" title="Hi Infidelity">
<text>Hi Infidelity is the ninth studio album by American rock band REO Speedwagon, released on November 21, 1980, by Epic Records. The album became a big hit in the United States, peaking at number one on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, spending 15 weeks at number one (only 27 albums, and only 7 rock acts, have spent at least 15 weeks at number 1). It went on to become the biggest-selling album of 1981, eventually being certified 10 times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. 

Of the four singles released, &quot;Take It on the Run&quot; went to number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the band got their first of two number one hits with &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot;.

== Background ==
The album title is a play on the term &quot;in high fidelity,&quot; which used to appear on album covers. The album art is an illustration of this pun where an act of sexual infidelity is apparently occurring while the man is putting a record LP to play on the hi-fi stereo.

== Songs ==
Six songs from the album charted on the Billboard charts, including &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; which was the band&#x27;s first Number 1 hit, and &quot;Take It on the Run&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the charts. The song &quot;Tough Guys&quot; uses an audio clip from the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short film &quot;Hearts Are Thumps&quot; (1937).

&quot;Tough Guys&quot; was one of two songs from the album that charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart despite not being released as singles. Music critic Robert Christgau called &quot;Tough Guys&quot; his favorite song from the album but suggested that the line &quot;They think they&#x27;re full of fire/She thinks they&#x27;re full of shit&quot; would prevent the song from reaching the pop Top 40.

&quot;Record World&quot; described &quot;I Wish You Were There&quot; as having a &quot;novel gospel touch.&quot;

== Reissues ==
On October 25, 2004, the band recorded the songs of this album live from beginning to end for an XM Radio &quot;Then Again Live&quot; special.

On July 19, 2011, Sony Music re-released &quot;Hi Infidelity&quot; with bonus demo tracks for the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Demo tracks were recorded Live at Crystal Studios, Hollywood, June through August 1980.

<text>In computer science, online codes are an example of rateless erasure codes. These codes can encode a message into a number of symbols such that knowledge of any fraction of them allows one to recover the original message (with high probability). &quot;Rateless&quot; codes produce an arbitrarily large number of symbols which can be broadcast until the receivers have enough symbols.

The online encoding algorithm consists of several phases. First the message is split into &quot;n&quot; fixed size message blocks. Then the &quot;outer encoding&quot; is an erasure code which produces auxiliary blocks that are appended to the message blocks to form a composite message.

From this the inner encoding generates check blocks. Upon receiving a certain number of check blocks some fraction of the composite message can be recovered. Once enough has been recovered the outer decoding can be used to recover the original message.

==Detailed discussion==
Online codes are parameterised by the block size and two scalars, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;ε&quot;. The authors suggest &quot;q&quot;=3 and ε=0.01. These parameters set the balance between the complexity and performance of the encoding. A message of &quot;n&quot; blocks can be recovered, with high probability, from (1+3ε)&quot;n&quot; check blocks. The probability of failure is (ε/2)q+1.

===Outer encoding===
Any erasure code may be used as the outer encoding, but the author of online codes suggest the following.

For each message block, pseudo-randomly choose &quot;q&quot; auxiliary blocks 
(from a total of 0.55&quot;q&quot;ε&quot;n&quot; auxiliary blocks) to attach it to. Each auxiliary block is then the XOR of all the message blocks which have been attached to it.

===Inner encoding===
The inner encoding takes the composite message and generates a stream of check blocks. A check block is the XOR of all the blocks from the composite message that it is attached to.

The &quot;degree&quot; of a check block is the number of blocks that it is attached to. The degree is determined by sampling a random distribution, &quot;p&quot;, which is defined as:

:formula_1

:formula_2

:formula_3 for formula_4

Once the degree of the check block is known, the blocks from the composite message which it is attached to are chosen uniformly.

===Decoding===
Obviously the decoder of the inner stage must hold check blocks which it cannot currently . A check block can only be decoded when all but one of the blocks which it is attached to are known. The graph to the left shows the progress of an inner decoder. The x-axis plots the number of check blocks received and the dashed line shows the number of check blocks which cannot currently be used. This climbs almost linearly at first as many check blocks with degree &gt; 1 are received but unusable. At a certain point, some of the check blocks are suddenly usable, resolving more blocks which then causes more check blocks to be usable. Very quickly the whole file can be decoded.

As the graph also shows the inner decoder falls just shy of decoding everything for a little while after having received &quot;n&quot; check blocks. The outer encoding ensures that a few elusive blocks from the inner decoder are not an issue, as the file can be recovered without them.

<text>Horton is a village in East Dorset, England, situated on the boundary between the chalk downland of Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Heaths, and ten miles north of Poole. The village has a population of 515 (2001).

==Overview==
The name &quot;Horton&quot; is a common one in England. It derives from Old English &quot;horu&quot; &#x27;dirt&#x27; and &quot;tūn&quot; &#x27;settlement, farm, estate&#x27;, presumably meaning &#x27;farm on muddy soil&#x27;. The earliest reference to the one in Dorset is in a charter of 946 ACE, albeit surviving only in a fourteenth-century copy, which mentions &#x27;oþ hore tuninge gemære&#x27; (&#x27;to the boundary of the people of Horton&#x27;).

The village has two unusual buildings: the Horton Tower, a five storey gothic red brick observatory designed by Humphrey Sturt whose principal purpose now is that of a disguised mobile phone mast for operator Vodafone, and the 18th century Georgian church of St Wolfrida, built on the site of the tenth century Horton Priory. Wolfrida was the mother of Saint Edith of Wilton.

Horton is claimed as the location where James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, was captured after the failed Monmouth Rebellion. Monmouth hid in a ditch under an ash tree disguised as a shepherd but was betrayed by a local woman who, according to legend, later killed herself in remorse.

The village once had a manor house but this was superseded by Crichel House, a nearby stately home, and the manor house decayed and was pulled down. The stables, now converted into the rectory, and a large ornamental lake, remain.

Horton church is the burial place of Sir George Hastings.

<text>Bruce Peebles &amp; Co. Ltd. was an Edinburgh industrial electrical engineering company.

==Early history==
The company was founded as D. Bruce Peebles &amp; Co. by Scottish engineer David Bruce Peebles (1826–1899) in Edinburgh in 1866. The company initially specialised in gas engineering but later expanded to include electrical engineering as well. It continued to trade after Peebles&#x27; death and, in 1902, the name was changed to Bruce Peebles &amp; Co. Ltd. The company held the British manufacturing rights for the Cascade converter and a licence to manufacture three-phase electrical equipment designed by Ganz of Budapest.

==Canadian Electric Traction Company==
In 1903, Peebles expanded into Canada. Along with other investors, it formed the Canadian Electric Traction Company and supplied the three-phase equipment, car motors and generators for the South Western Traction Company of London, Ontario. The main line ran 28-miles between London and Port Stanley, a resort town on Lake Erie. It was the only three-phase traction line in Canada, and was closed in 1918.

==New factory==
In 1904 the company opened a new factory at a site in East Pilton, Edinburgh, employing 3,000 at its peak in the 1950s. The works had its own internal railway system, which was electrified and used electric shunting locomotives built by Peebles themselves. This was the first electric line in Edinburgh (main line electrification did not reach Edinburgh until the early 1990s). In 1905 the company was exhibiting at the Third International Electric Tramway and Railway Exhibition. It also manufactured at least one (from an order of ten) electric locomotives for the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway.

==War work==
During both World Wars, the works produced shells, submarine and aircraft parts, tank and electrical equipment such as mobile search lights and minesweeping units.

==Woodhead Line electrification==
It was the main sub contractor for the electrification of the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield from 1947–1954, a major engineering achievement. Throughout this period it specialised in large scale transformers for power stations, including the world&#x27;s largest 400 kV &#x27;quadrature booster&#x27; for the UK national grid. It also produced heavy electric motors for various uses, including railway locomotives.

==Ownership changes==
The company became part of the Reyrolle Parsons Group in 1969, part of Northern Engineering Industries in 1977 and part of Rolls-Royce plc in 1989.

Many young electrical engineers were taken on by this company, with a special course in electrical engineering being run at the nearby Telford College. They gained skills in highly specialised work, and Peebles&#x27; products were exported all over the world. The late Ron Brown, MP for Leith, was employed by the company, as was the late Sir Duncan McDonald who was the chief transformer designer.

==The business divided==
In 1998 the business was split, with the Peebles Electrical Machine Division (Motors &amp; Generators) being acquired by Pope (Australia) and the Transformer Division going to the Austrian company VA Tech.

===Transformer division===
In April 1999 a substantial fire destroyed the main transformer works in East Pilton. The company decided that a replacement factory should be relocated to Leith Docks to better facilitate transfer of the largest transformers onto ships for export. The Pilton site was sold for residential redevelopment. VA Tech closed the Leith factory during 2005 and continued service work only. The entire VA Tech company became part of Siemens that year.

===Motors &amp; Generators division===
The motors &amp; generators business relocated to Wood Road in the nearby Rosyth dockyard. Parsons Peebles Motor &amp; Generators was acquired by Clyde Blowers Capital in January 2013. The company is still located in the Royal dockyard Rosyth and continues to manufacture and service specialised motors and generators.

<text>Torghatten is a granite dome on the island of Torget in Brønnøy Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. It is known for its characteristic hole, or natural tunnel, through its center. It is possible to walk up to the tunnel on a well-prepared path, and through it on a natural path.

On 6 May 1988, Widerøe Flight 710 from Namsos Airport to Brønnøysund Airport crashed into the side of the mountain, and all 36 passengers and crew died.

==Tunnel==

According to legend, the hole was made by the troll &quot;Hestmannen&quot; while he was chasing the beautiful woman &quot;Lekamøya&quot;. As the troll realized he would not overtake her, he released an arrow to kill her, but the troll-king of Sømna threw his hat into the arrow&#x27;s path to save her. The hat turned into the mountain with a hole in the middle.

The tunnel is long, wide, and high. It was formed during the Scandinavian ice age. Ice and water eroded the looser rocks, while the harder ones in the mountain top have resisted erosion.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism and radicalism in [[Paraguay]]. It is limited to liberal and radical parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn&#x27;t necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Introduction==
Organized liberalism existed in Paraguay since 1870 and is still one of the dominant political forces, though it has not been in government for long time. The Authentic Radical Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal Radical Auténtico&quot;, member LI) is a left of center liberal party.

==The timeline==
===From Great Club of the People to Authentic Radical Liberal Party===
*1870: In resistance to the dictator Francisco Solano López liberals form the Great Club of the People (&quot;Gran Club del Pueblo&quot;)
*1877: The party is banned.
*1887: The party is revived as the Democratic Club (&quot;Club Democrático&quot;), later that year renamed into the Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal&quot;), led by Cecilio Báez. The party is in power from 1904 until 1936 and from 1939 until 1940.
*1942: The party is banned, but factions remained active in the illegality.
*1961: The factions reunited, but a conservative faction formed the &quot;Renewal Movement of the Liberal Party&quot; (since 1967 &quot;Liberal Party&quot;).
*1967: The party is renamed Radical Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal Radical&quot;).
*1977: The majority of the party led by Domingo Laino formed the Unified Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal Unificado&quot;) together with dissidents of the &quot;Liberal Party&quot;. The &quot;Radical Liberal Party&quot; continues as a puppet party of the regime.
*1978: The party is reorganized into the Authentic Radical Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal Radical Auténtico&quot;).
*1990: The party absorbed the &quot;Liberal Party&quot; and the &quot;Radical Liberal Party&quot;.

<doc id="1145848" wikidata="Q1033906" url="?curid=1145848" title="Pairing function">
<text>In mathematics, a pairing function is a process to uniquely encode two natural numbers into a single natural number.

Any pairing function can be used in set theory to prove that integers and rational numbers have the same cardinality as natural numbers.

==Definition==
A pairing function is a bijection
:formula_1

===Generalization===
More generally, a pairing function on a set formula_2 is a function that maps each pair of elements from formula_2 into an element of formula_2, such that any two pairs of elements of formula_2 are associated with different elements of formula_2, or a bijection from formula_7 to formula_2.

Instead of abstracting from the domain, the arity of the pairing function can also be generalized: there exists an n-ary generalized Cantor pairing function on formula_9.

== Hopcroft and Ullman pairing function ==
Hopcroft and Ullman (1979) define the following pairing function: formula_10, where formula_11. This is the same as the Cantor pairing function below, shifted to exclude 0 (i.e., formula_12, formula_13, and formula_14).

== Cantor pairing function ==
The Cantor pairing function is a primitive recursive pairing function
:formula_15
defined by 
:formula_16
where formula_17.

It can also be expressed as formula_18.

It is also strictly monotonic w.r.t. each argument, that is, for all formula_19, if formula_20, then formula_21; similarly, if formula_22, then formula_23.

The statement that this is the only quadratic pairing function is known as the Fueter–Pólya theorem. Whether this is the only polynomial pairing function is still an open question. When we apply the pairing function to and we often denote the resulting number as .

This definition can be inductively generalized to the 
:formula_24
for formula_25 as
:formula_26
with the base case defined above for a pair: formula_27

=== Inverting the Cantor pairing function ===
Let formula_28 be an arbitrary natural number. We will show that there exist unique values formula_29 such that

:formula_30

and hence that the function is invertible. It is helpful to define some intermediate values in the calculation: 
:formula_31
:formula_32
:formula_33

where is the triangle number of . If we solve the quadratic equation 
:formula_34

for as a function of , we get 
:formula_35

which is a strictly increasing and continuous function when is non-negative real. Since 
:formula_36

we get that 
:formula_37

and thus 
:formula_38
where is the floor function.
So to calculate and from , we do:
:formula_39
:formula_40
:formula_41
:formula_42

Since the Cantor pairing function is invertible, it must be one-to-one and onto.

=== Examples ===

To calculate :
:,
:,
so .

To find and such that :
:,
:,
:,
so ;
:,
so ;
so ;
so ; thus .

=== Derivation ===
The graphical shape of Cantor&#x27;s pairing function, a diagonal progression, is a standard trick in working with infinite sequences and countability. The algebraic rules of this diagonal-shaped function can verify its validity for a range of polynomials, of which a quadratic will turn out to be the simplest, using the method of induction. Indeed, this same technique can also be followed to try and derive any number of other functions for any variety of schemes for enumerating the plane.

A pairing function can usually be defined inductively – that is, given the th pair, what is the th pair? The way Cantor&#x27;s function progresses diagonally across the plane can be expressed as
:formula_43.

The function must also define what to do when it hits the boundaries of the 1st quadrant – Cantor&#x27;s pairing function resets back to the x-axis to resume its diagonal progression one step further out, or algebraically:
:formula_44.

Also we need to define the starting point, what will be the initial step in our induction method: .

Assume that there is a quadratic 2-dimensional polynomial that can fit these conditions (if there were not, one could just repeat by trying a higher-degree polynomial). The general form is then
:formula_45.

Plug in our initial and boundary conditions to get and:
:formula_46,

so we can match our terms to get
:

So every parameter can be written in terms of except for , and we have a final equation, our diagonal step, that will relate them:
:formula_47

Expand and match terms again to get fixed values for and , and thus all parameters:
:
:.

Therefore
:formula_48

is the Cantor pairing function, and we also demonstrated through the derivation that this satisfies all the conditions of induction.

== Other pairing functions ==
The function formula_49 is a pairing function.

In 1990, Regan proposed the first known pairing function that is computable in linear time and with constant space (as the previously known examples can only be computed in linear time if multiplication can be too, which is doubtful). In fact, both this pairing function and its inverse can be computed with finite-state transducers that run in real time. In the same paper, the author proposed two more monotone pairing functions that can be computed online in linear time and with logarithmic space; the first can also be computed offline with zero space.

In 2001, Pigeon proposed a pairing function based on bit-interleaving, defined recursively as:

:formula_50

where formula_51 and formula_52 are the least significant bits of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; respectively.

In 2006, Szudzik proposed a &quot;more elegant&quot; pairing function defined by the expression:
:formula_53
Which can be unpaired using the expression:
:formula_54
(Qualitatively, it assigns consecutive numbers to pairs along the edges of squares.) This pairing function orders SK combinator calculus expressions by depth.
This method is the mere application to formula_55 of the idea, found in most textbooks on Set Theory,
used to establish formula_56 for any infinite cardinal formula_57 in ZFC.
Define on formula_58 the binary relation
:formula_59
formula_60 is then shown to be a well-ordering such that every element has formula_61 predecessors, which implies that formula_56.
It follows that formula_63 is isomorphic to formula_64 and the pairing function above is nothing more than the enumeration of integer couples in increasing order.

<text>Inter gravissimas (English: &quot;Among the most serious...&quot;) was a papal bull issued by Pope Gregory XIII on 24 February 1582. The document, written in Latin, reformed the Julian calendar. The reform came to be regarded as a new calendar in its own right and came to be called the Gregorian calendar, which is used in most countries today.

==Description==
The intention expressed by the text of this bull was &quot;to restore&quot; the calendar so that seasonal events critical for the calculation of Easter dates would be back in their &quot;proper places&quot; and would be prevented from being moved away again. The idea of reform as such is not otherwise mentioned. The bull identifies &quot;three necessary&quot; things for the correct determination of Easter dates: correct placement of the northern vernal equinox; correct identification of the &quot;14th day of the moon&quot; (effectively full moon) that happens on or next after the vernal equinox, and the first Sunday that follows that full moon. The first two items were the ones that received attention; the third, about choosing the next following Sunday, was not identified as causing any problem, and was not further mentioned.

By &quot;restore&quot;, Gregory meant two things. First, he adjusted the calendar so that the vernal equinox was near March 21, where it had been during the Council of Nicaea (20 May– 25 August 325). This required removing ten days of drift. Second, he made the tabular 14th day of the moon correspond with the real full moon, removing &quot;four days and more&quot; of drift. This would restore the dates of Easter to near where they were at the time of the Council of Nicaea, although that council had not specified where in the calendar the vernal equinox should fall and had not adopted any particular type of lunar tables. The practices of the Roman Catholic Church that had become traditional by 1582 for calculating the Easter and lunar calendars became settled when Dionysius Exiguus translated the rules of the Church of Alexandria from Greek into Latin in 525. (Northumbria adopted them at Whitby in 664, the Welsh around 768, and France around 775. Before this, France and Rome had used Victorius&#x27;s less exact 457 translation of the Coptic calendar; Britain and Rome before Victorius had used Augustalis&#x27;s 84-year cycle.)

Gregory also made changes to the calendar rules, intending to ensure that, in the future, the equinox and the 14th day of the Paschal moon, and consequently Easter Sunday, would not move away again from what the bull called their proper places.

The changes (relative to the Julian calendar) were as follows:

# Reduction of the number of leap years – centennial years, such as 1700, 1800, and 1900 ceased to be leap years, but years that can be divided by 400, such as 1600 and 2000 continued to be;
# Turning back extra days – 4 October 1582, was to be followed by 15 October 1582, and these 10 missing days were not to be counted in calculating end days of loans, taxes etc.;
# Easter was to be computed with reference not only to the new 21 March, but also by the use of new Paschal tables.

The name of the bull consists of the first two words of the bull, which starts: &quot;Inter gravissimas pastoralis officii nostri curas…&quot; (&quot;Among the most serious duties of our pastoral office…&quot;).

The bull refers to &quot;the explanation of our calendar&quot; and to a canon related to the dominical letter. To accompany the bull there were six chapters of explanatory rules (&#x27;canons&#x27;), and some of these (canons 1, 2, 4) refer to a book entitled &quot;Liber novæ rationis restituendi calendarii Romani&quot; for a fuller explanation of the tables than that contained in the canons (or the bull). Because the bull and canons refer to each other, they must have been written at roughly the same time, printed at the same time (1 March), and distributed to the several countries together.

These canons enabled the computation of Easter dates in the reformed (&#x27;restored&#x27;) Gregorian calendar, and gave two calendar-listings saints&#x27; days, one for the &#x27;year of correction&#x27; (1582) and another for the entire new Gregorian year. The bull, canons, and calendars were reprinted as part of the principal book explaining and defending the Gregorian calendar, Christoph Clavius, &quot;Romani calendarii a Gregorio XIII. P. M. restituti explicatio&quot; (1603), which is tome V in his collected works &quot;Opera Mathematica&quot; (1612).

==Date==
The version of &quot;Inter gravissimas&quot; included by Christoph Clavius in his work explaining the Gregorian calendar contained these dating clauses: &quot;Anno Incarnationis Dominicae M. D. LXXXI. Sexto Calend. Martij, Pontificatus nostri Anno Decimo. ... Anno à Natiuitate Domini nostri Iesu Christi Millesimo Quingentesimo Octuagesimo secundo Indictione decima,&quot;. These clauses include four years:
*&quot;Anno Incarnationis Dominicae M. D. LXXXI.&quot; (In the year of the Incarnation of the Lord 1581) is the year beginning . is the traditional date of the conception, annunciation, and incarnation of Jesus.
*&quot;Sexto Calend. Martij&quot; (On the sixth [day] before the Kalends [1st] of March.) The Romans counted inclusively; modern usage would say the fifth day before 1 March, or 24 February.
*&quot;Pontificatus nostri Anno Decimo&quot; (In the tenth year of our pontificate) is the year beginning . Gregory XIII was elected pope on (in terms of the Julian calendar).
*&quot;Anno à Natiuitate Domini nostri Iesu Christi Millesimo Quingentesimo Octuagesimo secundo&quot; (In the year from the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ 1582) is the year beginning using the modern beginning of the year. It marks the beginning of year 1582 if that year began on , the traditional date of the birth or nativity of Jesus.
*&quot;Indictione decima&quot; (Indiction 10) is the year beginning , which agrees with modern reckoning.
All of these years agree that the bull was dated 24 February 1582, using the modern beginning of the year.

==Adoption==
Gregory&#x27;s reform was enacted in the most solemn of forms available to the Church, but the bull had no authority beyond the Catholic Church and the Papal States. The changes which Gregory was proposing included changes to the civil calendar over which Gregory had no authority (except in the Papal States). The text of the bull recognized this by giving what amounted to orders to the clergy and those &quot;presiding over churches&quot;: but in contrast, where the text addresses the civil authorities (&quot;kings, princes and republics&quot;), it &quot;asks&quot;, &quot;exhorts&quot; and &quot;recommends&quot; the new calendar changes. The changes required adoption by the civil authorities in each country to have legal effect.

The bull &quot;Inter gravissimas&quot; was immediately adopted by the major Catholic powers of Europe, but the Protestant countries refused to adopt it until the 18th century, and Eastern European countries adopted it only during or after World War I (the last European country to adopt it was Greece, in 1923). 

Most Eastern Orthodox Churches and Oriental Orthodox Churches have not adopted it at all and continue to reckon their ecclesiastical years by the Julian calendar, even though their home countries use the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes.

<text>WAEC (860 kHz) is an AM radio station in Atlanta, Georgia, The station is owned by Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., through licensee Beasley Media Group, LLC,

Originally a 1,000-watt daytime-only station, in the mid-1980s WAEC increased power to 5,000 watts, then was licensed for a 24-hour signal with 500 watts during nighttime hours and 2,500 watts during critical hours. The station uses a non-directional antenna during daytime and critical hours, and a directional antenna system at night. The broadcast towers are located near the Flat Shoals Road exit of Interstate 20 in Atlanta.

==History==

===WERD===

WERD was the first radio station owned and operated by African Americans. The station was established in Atlanta, Georgia in 1948. Though WDIA in Memphis was on the air a year earlier carrying black-oriented programming, the station was not owned by African Americans.

Jesse B. Blayton Sr., an accountant, bank president, and Atlanta University professor, purchased WERD in 1949 for $50,000. He changed the station format to &quot;black appeal&quot; and hired his son Jesse Jr. as station manager. &quot;Jockey&quot; Jack Gibson was hired soon after, and by 1951 was the most popular DJ in Atlanta. The station was housed in the Masonic building on Auburn Avenue, then one of the wealthiest black neighborhoods in the United States. Located in that same building was the headquarters of the new Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by Martin Luther King Jr. It has been said that Dr. King had his offices right under the radio station. A WERD staffer would let the microphone out the window to the first floor, and Dr. King would bring the microphone in his window and make a speech.

Blayton sold the station in 1968, and in 1969, its call sign was changed to WXAP.

===WAEC===
The station briefly changed to country music in the late 1970s under new owner, Mike Sears, before becoming WAEC on December 3, 1978. The first station to play contemporary Christian music in Atlanta, its new call letters stood for &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Electric Church&quot;.

Don Stone was hired as general manager a year later and changed the slogan to &quot;Love 86&quot;. Stone built the station to be one of the most successful Christian stations in the country, and created several publications for the station including the Atlanta Christian Business Directory and the &quot;Love 86 Express&quot; newspaper. Stone stayed at the station until 1994, when he departed to focus on publishing the Atlanta Christian Business Directory and The Love 86 Express, now &quot;Atlanta Christian Magazine&quot;.

Sears sold the station to Tampa-based Forus Communications in 1982, who sold the station 20 years later to Beasley Broadcasting.

On November 15, 2023, WAEC changed formats from christian talk to Spanish-language salsa music, branded as &quot;Playa 860&quot;.

In June 2024, WAEC went silent after the land their broadcast tower is located on near I-20 and Flat Shoals Road was sold to a developer.

<doc id="1145863" wikidata="Q1759746" url="?curid=1145863" title="Thermoforming">
<text>Thermoforming is a manufacturing process where a plastic sheet is heated to a pliable forming temperature, formed to a specific shape in a mold, and trimmed to create a usable product. The sheet, or &quot;film&quot; when referring to thinner gauges and certain material types, is heated in an oven to a high-enough temperature that permits it to be stretched into or onto a mold and cooled to a finished shape. Its simplified version is vacuum forming.

In its simplest form, a small tabletop or lab size machine can be used to heat small cut sections of plastic sheet and stretch it over a mold using vacuum. This method is often used for sample and prototype parts. In complex and high-volume applications, very large production machines are utilized to heat and form the plastic sheet and trim the formed parts from the sheet in a continuous high-speed process and can produce many thousands of finished parts per hour depending on the machine and mold size and the size of the parts being formed.

Thermoforming differs from injection molding, blow molding, rotational molding and other forms of processing plastics. Thin-gauge thermoforming is primarily the manufacture of disposable cups, containers, lids, trays, blisters, clamshells, and other products for the food, medical, and general retail industries. Thick-gauge thermoforming includes parts as diverse as vehicle door and dash panels, refrigerator liners, utility vehicle beds and plastic pallets.

Most thermoforming companies recycle their scrap and waste plastic, either by compressing in a baling machine or by feeding into a granulator (grinder) and producing ground flake, for sale to reprocessing companies or re-use in their own facility. Frequently, scrap and waste plastic from the thermoforming process is converted back into extruded sheet for forming again.

==Procedure==

In the most common method of high-volume, continuous thermoforming of thin-gauge products, plastic sheet is fed from a roll or from an extruder into a set of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and transport it through an oven for heating to forming temperature. The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (Plug-assists are typically used in addition to vacuum in the case of taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas. The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web or indexes into a separate trim press where the formed parts are trimmed. The sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling.

==Developments==
Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheets into an inline trim station for more precise trim registration has been improved due to the common use of electric servo motors for chain indexing versus air cylinders, gear racks, and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the machine platens where form and trim tooling are mounted, rather than air cylinders which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling. Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat.

A new technology, ToolVu, has been developed to provide real-time feedback on thermoformer machines. This stand-alone system connects directly to the thermoformer and utilizes multiple sensors to record production-run data in real time including air pressure, temperature, tool strain gauge and other specifications. The system sends out multiple warnings and alerts whenever pre-set production parameters are compromised during a run. This reduces machine down time, lowers startup time and decreases startup scrap.

An integral part of the thermoforming process is the tooling, which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically, thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited to the quality of the tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.

==Thin-gauge and heavy-gauge (thick) thermoforming==
There are two general thermoforming process categories. Sheet thickness less than 1.5 mm (0.060 inches) is usually delivered to the thermoforming machine from rolls or from a sheet extruder. Thin-gauge roll-fed or inline extruded thermoforming applications are dominated by rigid or semi-rigid disposable packaging. Sheet thicknesses greater than 3 mm (0.120 inches) are usually delivered to the forming machine by hand or an auto-feed method already cut to final dimensions. Heavy, or thick-gauge, cut sheet thermoforming applications are primarily used as permanent structural components. There is a small but growing medium-gauge market that forms sheet 1.5 mm to 3 mm in thickness.

Heavy-gauge forming utilizes the same basic process as continuous thin-gauge sheet forming, typically draping the heated plastic sheet over a mold. Many heavy-gauge forming applications use vacuum only in the form process, although some use two halves of mating form tooling and include air pressure to help form. Aircraft windscreens and machine gun turret windows spurred the advance of heavy-gauge forming technology during World War II. Heavy-gauge parts are used as cosmetic surfaces on permanent structures such as kiosks, automobiles, trucks, medical equipment, material handling equipment, refrigerators, spas, and shower enclosures, and electrical and electronic equipment. Unlike most thin-gauge thermoformed parts, heavy-gauge parts are often hand-worked after forming for trimming to final shape or for additional drilling, cutting, or finishing, depending on the product. Heavy-gauge products typically are of a &quot;permanent&quot; end use nature, while thin-gauge parts are more often designed to be disposable or recyclable and are primarily used to package or contain a food item or product. Heavy-gauge thermoforming is typically used for production quantities of 250 to 3000 annually, with lower tooling costs and faster product development than competing plastic technologies like injection molding.

Olimunllum CF/PEEK is obtained by thick gauge thermoforming of thin layers of previously impregnated fibers to form fully consolidated sheets. The main difference from custom-made composite plates lies in the standardized orientation of the reinforcing fibers, the standardized weight content of the polymer and standardized sheet thicknesses. This allows easy design and post-processing using identical or similar tools as commonly used when working with metallic light-weight materials like aluminium, titanium and steel.

==Industry==
The more than US$10 billion North American market has traditionally been thin gauge and heavy gauge. In 2003 there were about 150 thin-gauge thermoformers in North America. Sixty percent formed proprietary products. Thirty percent were custom formers and 10 percent were OEMs with in-house forming capability. There were nearly a dozen thin-gauge formers having annual sales of at least $100 million. The largest had annual sales in excess of $1,000 million. There were about 250 heavy-gauge formers in North America. Nearly all were custom formers. Only two or three heavy-gauge formers had annual sales of more than $100 million. The largest had annual sales of about $140 million. Beaverton, Michigan, is known as the Plastic Thermoforming capital of the world fueled by the proximity of Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Michigan.

<doc id="1145865" wikidata="Q175996" url="?curid=1145865" title="Vacuum forming">
<text>Vacuum forming is a simplified version of thermoforming, where a sheet of plastic in various forms of High Impact Polystyrene Sheet (HIPS) for low impact products, or ABS for bathroom shower trays, and HDPE for exterior vehicle parts, plus various other types of vacuum formable materials) is heated to a forming temperature, stretched onto a single-surface mould, and forced against the mould by a vacuum. This process can be used to form plastic into permanent objects such as turnpike signs and protective covers. Normally draft angles are present in the design of the mould (a recommended minimum of 3°) to ease removal of the formed plastic part from the mould.

Relatively deep parts can be formed if the formable sheet is mechanically or pneumatically stretched prior to bringing it into contact with the mold surface and applying the vacuum.

Suitable materials for use in vacuum forming are conventionally thermoplastics. The most common and easiest to use thermoplastic is high impact polystyrene sheeting (HIPS). This is molded around a wood, structural foam or cast or machined aluminium mold, and can form to almost any shape. This high impact material is hygienic and capable of retaining heat and its shape when warm water is applied and is commonly used to package taste and odor sensitive products. Vacuum forming is also appropriate for transparent materials such as acrylic, which are widely used in applications for aerospace such as passenger cabin window canopies for military fixed wing aircraft and compartments for rotary wing aircraft. Vacuum forming is often used in low-level technology classes for an easy way to mold.

Modern vacuum-forming equipment is based on a series of US patents awarded in 1950, 1964, and 1974.

==Typical applications==

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) utilize heavy gauge vacuum formed components for production quantities in the range of 250–3000 units per year. Vacuum-formed components can be used in place of complex fabricated sheet metal, fiberglass, or plastic injection molding. Typical industry examples besides product packaging include: fascias for outdoor kiosks and automated teller machines, enclosures for medical imaging and diagnostic equipment, engine covers in a truck cab or for construction equipment, and railcar interior trim and seat components. Vacuum formers are also often used by hobbyists, for applications such as masks and remote control cars.

== Common problems ==
There are some problems encountered in the vacuum forming process. Absorbed moisture can expand, forming bubbles within the plastic&#x27;s inner layers. This significantly weakens the plastic. However, this can be solved by drying the plastic for an extended period at high but sub-melting temperature. Webs can form around the mold, which is due to overheating the plastic and so must be carefully monitored. Webbing can also occur when a mold is too large or parts of the mold are too close together. Finally, objects that are formed often stick to the mold, which is remedied by using a draft angle of three degrees or more in the mold.

==Types of molds==
There are numerous patterns one can make with vacuum forming. The most inventive way to use vacuum forming is to take any small item, replicate it many times and then vacuum form the new pattern to create a more cohesive form. The vacuum forming helps tie the individual pieces together and make one mold out of many pieces that can easily be replicated. From there plaster, concrete, etc. can be cast into the plastic form.

Wood patterns are a common material to vacuum form as it is relatively inexpensive and allows the customer to make changes to the design easily. The number of samples that one is able to get from any pattern depends on the size of the part and the thickness of the material. Once the specifications of the part have been met, the pattern is then used to create a ceramic composite mold, or cast aluminum mold for regular production. Potentially, there are ways to create holes in plaster with a vacuum form if the replicated forms made from the vacuum form are deep enough and gaps are left between them for the plastic to form into. Then, once the plastic is used to cast a plaster mold, the deep plastic areas will leave holes if the mold is not completely filled.

Cast aluminium molds are cast at a foundry and typically have temperature control lines running through them. This helps to set the heat of the plastic being formed as well as speed up the fabrication process. Aluminium molds can be male or female in nature, and can also be used in pressure forming applications. The main drawback with this type of mold is the cost.
Machined aluminium molds are like cast aluminium, but are cut out of a solid block of aluminium using a CNC machine and a CAD program. Typically, machined aluminium is used for shallow draw parts out of thin gauge material. Applications may include packaging and trays. Cost is a significant factor with this type of tooling.

Composite molds are a lower cost alternative to cast or machined aluminium molds. Composite molds are typically made from filled resins that start as a liquid and harden with time. Depending on the application, composite molds can last a very long time and produce high quality parts.

==Finishing methods==

Once a vacuum forming has been created out of a sheet of plastic, a finishing operation will be needed in most cases to turn it into a usable product. Common vacuum forming finishing methods include:

* Guillotining: The product is cut out of the sheet by pressing a blade through the product into a die underneath. This is a clean way of removing vacuum formed parts from the material sheet. It doesn&#x27;t require a special cutting tool to be made for an individual product and is therefore suitable for low volumes of parts where straight lines are no problem. Cutting only straight lines and being a fairly slow approach compared to other finishing methods, guillotining can be expensive for projects with larger, more complex quantities.
* Drilling: If simple round holes are the required finish, manually drilling them is a good solution for small quantities. Drilling guides can be used to ensure holes can be drilled quickly in the right place. As this is a labour-intensive method, it is only suitable for small production quantities.
* Roller cutting: Process whereby the vacuum formed product is placed on a custom made cutter and pushed through a roller cutter machine. An efficient way of cutting vacuum formed items from the original sheet of vacuum forming material. The cutter can also cut any necessary holes, such as cable or access holes, at the same time. Roller cutting is suitable for fairly large items, where precision alignment is not required. As the vacuum formings and the cutter are rolled sideways through the roller cutter machine, some misalignment can occur. Roller cutting can&#x27;t be used for making holes or features in the sides of vacuum formings, as the cutter tool always cuts vertically from the bottom.
* Press cutting: This is a very precise method of cutting which uses a press and a custom precision made cutting tool. This method is very suitable for items where the roller cutter process wouldn&#x27;t achieve the precision required. It is often used for punching very small finished items out of a plastic sheet, rather than punching features into a product. Press cutting can&#x27;t be used to make features in the sides of vacuum formings.
* Cutting with a CNC machine: Machining is a very precise method of creating holes &amp; features. The real advantage is that it can be used to create features in the sides of vacuum forming, e.g. guide rails for a tray that needs to slide onto shelving. It can also cut sidewalls of a different depth than the pockets—something which cannot be done with roller or press cutting.&lt;

<doc id="1145880" wikidata="Q7653398" url="?curid=1145880" title="Swampscott dory">
<text>The Swampscott dory is a traditional fishing boat, used during the middle of the 19th century by fishing villages along the North Shore coast of Massachusetts centered on Swampscott. It is designed to be launched off the beach. The rounded hull provides more buoyancy for launching through surf than the slab sided banks dory. The flat bottom allows the boat to sit upright on the beach. The lack of a keel keeps the boat from being grabbed by a wave and allows the boat to pass cleanly through the surf. The boat still heels easily which allows large fish to be rolled into the boat vs having to lift the fish completely up over the gunnel. The Swampscott Dory, a fishing boat still in use throughout the world today, was invented in 1840 by Theophilius Brackett to row and to pull lobster pots. These dories compare favorably with the New Bedford whaleboat and the Gloucester seine boat.

The Swampscott dory is a melding of the earlier Wherry design and the river bateau, which later led to new construction techniques used in the mass production of the Banks dory. Swampscott dories are built with rounded sides and slightly less overhang stern than a banks dory. Swampscott dories are generally from 14 to 18 ft in length, the longer boat being crewed by two oarsmen.

Eventually the Swampscott dory developed into a recreational sailboat as well, known as the &quot;clipper dory&quot;, and then the &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beachcomber dory&quot;. These inexpensive sailboats were raced along the coast of Massachusetts during the early part of the 20th century. The sail rig was typically a Leg of Mutton and small jib on an unstayed mast.

According to Gardner, Swampscott dorys are the &quot;aristocrats of the dory clan and not to be confused with their clumsier, more crudely built cousins, the heavy, slab-sided working dories of the Grand Banks fishermen.&quot; He feels that the Swampscott dory rows and handles more easily, and are every bit as good seaboats.

Lowell&#x27;s Boat Shop, one of the original builders of dories, markets a similar boat as a surf dory.

<text>Judy Shalom Nir-Mozes (; born 14 August 1958) is an Israeli socialite, investor and talk show host.

==Early life==
Judy (Judith) Mozes was born in Ramat Gan to Paula and Noah Mozes, owners of the &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot; newspaper, their third child after Gilad Mozes, who was killed in a car accident in 1959, and Arnon Mozes, the current newspaper publisher. Her youngest sister is Tammy Mozes, who currently owns several Israeli companies.

She attended Ohel Shem and &quot;Hadash&quot; high schools. In the Israel Defense Forces she served as an official hostess for different public personalities at Sde Dov Airport in Tel Aviv.

==Career==
In 1994, after her mother Paula Mozes died, control of the newspaper was transferred to Judy&#x27;s brother Arnon Mozes. Together, Judy and Arnon gained control of the newspaper from their youngest sister Tammy, their cousins, and the editor-in-chief editor of the newspaper, Dov Yudkovsky after years of struggle. A few years later Tammy sold her share of the newspaper to Arnon and several other companies.

In addition to her family ascription and her family business, Judy has written for years in the weekend edition of &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, &quot;7 days,&quot; and hosted a TV show on Channel 2, &quot;Jude Luck.&quot; Today she has a weekly show on &quot;Reshet Bet&quot; of Kol Yisrael on Fridays at 11 p.m., where she talks about current events in the fields of politics, the economy and entertainment.

In April 2005, Nir-Mozes gave Prince Charles a gold talisman from Yitzhak Kaduri as a wedding present on the eve of his marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles. She said she had given a similar talisman to Bill Clinton during his presidency.

Judy is also a permanent panel member on the current events program &quot;Talking About It From Home&quot;. The show is hosted by Emmanuel Rosen live from the studio and the panel members, Judy among them, from home.

In February 2010 she joined an investment partnership with millionaire Zaki Rakib that will focus on investments in communications, media, health, and lifestyle. In March 2012 she joined Rakib and George Soros in investing a reported $500 million in a 4G mobile venture in Brazil&#x27;s Sao Paulo state.

==Controversies==
On June 22, 2011, she was the first to confirm in a tweet the rumor that journalist Yair Lapid would leave his career in journalism and enter politics. As the wife of the serving Vice Prime Minister, her assertion attracted media attention. Channel 2, which then employed both Mozes and Lapid, denied it, as did Lapid himself. Ultimately, Lapid announced he would run for the Knesset on January 8, 2012.

During Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012, her husband&#x27;s social media accounts were attacked by hackers. She tweeted in response in Hebrew that &quot;“The murderers have taken over Silvan’s Facebook, Twitter and email.&quot; During the conflict, she tweeted “I hope that today they decide to destroy Gaza if they don’t stop shooting. Let them suffer as well” and “It’s not fair that we’re sleeping here in silence and a million people down south live under fire! We need to bomb Gaza.” In the aftermath, she resigned as the chairperson of UNICEF Israel after activists launched a Facebook campaign against her and what they labeled as her &quot;racist comments.&quot;

On June 21, 2015, she provoked an angry international response when she tweeted “Do u know what Obama Coffee is? Black and weak.” She deleted the post shortly afterwards, adding another one in which she stated &quot;I apologize, that was a stupid joke somebody told me.&quot; In a subsequent tweet she personally apologized to President Obama, followed, a minute later, by another tweet in which she wrote &quot;Sorry if I caused any offence to anyone. I hope I will stay married when my husband will land and hear what I did&quot; (her husband, who was abroad at the time, was responsible for Israel&#x27;s strategic dialogue with the United States). The next day, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded that &quot;on Twitter you are limited to 140 characters, but it still has the capacity to be quite revealing.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1982 she married journalist Amiram Nir, with whom she had two children, Nimrod and Nadav. In 1985 her father was killed in a car accident in front of the Yedioth Ahronoth headquarters and ownership of the newspaper was transferred to her mother, Paula. In 1988 Amiram Nir died in a plane crash in Mexico. Five years later, in 1993, she remarried, to MK Silvan Shalom from the Likud party, who served in various ministerial positions in Israel, with whom she has three children. The couple separated in 2017 and divorced in 2021.

<text>Mobile telephony is the provision of wireless telephone services to mobile phones, distinguishing it from fixed-location telephony provided via landline phones. Traditionally, telephony specifically refers to voice communication, though the distinction has become less clear with the integration of additional features such as text messaging and data services.

Modern mobile phones connect to a terrestrial cellular network of base stations (commonly referred to as cell sites), using radio waves to facilitate communication. Satellite phones use wireless links to orbiting satellites, providing an alternative in areas lacking local terrestrial communication infrastructure, such as landline and cellular networks. Cellular networks, satellite networks, and landline systems are all linked to the public switched telephone network (PSTN), enabling calls to be made to and from nearly any telephone worldwide.

As of 2010, global estimates indicated approximately five billion mobile cellular subscriptions, highlighting the significant role of mobile telephony in global communication systems.

== History ==
According to internal memos, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph discussed developing a wireless phone in 1915, but were afraid that deployment of the technology could undermine its monopoly on wired service in the U.S.
Public mobile phone systems were first introduced in the years after the Second World War and made use of technology developed before and during the conflict. The first system opened in St. Louis, Missouri, United States in 1946 whilst other countries followed in the succeeding decades. The UK introduced its &#x27;System 1&#x27; manual radiotelephone service as the South Lancashire Radiophone Service in 1958. Calls were made via an operator using handsets identical to ordinary phone handsets. The phone itself was a large box located in the boot (trunk) of the vehicle containing valves and other early electronic components. Although an uprated manual service (&#x27;System 3&#x27;) was extended to cover most of the UK, automation did not arrive until 1981 with &#x27;System 4&#x27;. Although this non-cellular service, based on German B-Netz technology, was expanded rapidly throughout the UK between 1982 and 1985 and continued in operation for several years before finally closing in Scotland, it was overtaken by the introduction in January 1985 of two cellular systems - the British Telecom/Securicor &#x27;Cellnet&#x27; service and the Racal/Millicom/Barclays &#x27;Vodafone&#x27; (from voice + data + phone) service. These cellular systems were based on US Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) technology, the modified technology being named Total Access Communication System (TACS).

In 1947, Bell Labs was the first to propose a cellular radio telephone network. The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection. In 1956, the MTA system was launched in Sweden. The early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges: allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped. Both problems were solved by Bell Labs employee Amos Joel who, in 1970 applied for a patent for a mobile communications system. However, a business consulting firm calculated the entire U.S. market for mobile telephones at 100,000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200,000 units based on the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers. As a consequence, Bell Labs concluded that the invention was &quot;of little or no consequence,&quot; leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention. The invention earned Joel induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008.

The development of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) technology, information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications. The first call on a handheld mobile phone was made on April 3, 1973, by Martin Cooper, then of Motorola to his opposite number in Bell Labs who were also racing to be first. Bell Labs went on to install the first trial cellular network in Chicago in 1978. This trial system was licensed by the FCC to ATT for commercial use in 1982 and, as part of the divestiture arrangements for the breakup of ATT, the AMPS technology was distributed to local telcos. The first commercial system opened in Chicago in October 1983. A system designed by Motorola also operated in the Washington D.C./Baltimore area from summer 1982 and became a full public service later the following year. Japan&#x27;s first commercial radiotelephony service was launched by NTT in 1979.

The first fully automatic first generation cellular system was the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system, simultaneously launched in 1981 in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. NMT was the first mobile phone network featuring international roaming. The Swedish electrical engineer Östen Mäkitalo started to work on this vision in 1966, and is considered as the father of the NMT system and some also consider him the father of the cellular phone.

There was a rapid growth of wireless telecommunications towards the end of the 20th century, primarily due to the introduction of digital signal processing in wireless communications, driven by the development of low-cost, very large-scale integration (VLSI) RF CMOS (radio-frequency complementary MOS) technology. The advent of cellular technology encouraged European countries to co-operate in the development of a pan-European cellular technology to rival those of the US and Japan. This resulted in the GSM system, the initials originally from the &quot;Groupe Spécial Mobile&quot; that was charged with the specification and development tasks but latterly as the &#x27;Global System for Mobile Communications&#x27;. The GSM standard eventually spread outside Europe and is now the most widely used cellular technology in the world and the de facto standard. The industry association, the GSMA, now represents 219 countries and nearly 800 mobile network operators. There are now estimated to be over 5 billion phone subscriptions according to the &quot;List of countries by number of mobile phones in use&quot; (although some users have multiple subscriptions, or inactive subscriptions), which also makes the mobile phone the most widely spread technology and the most common electronic device in the world.

The first mobile phone to enable internet connectivity and wireless email, the Nokia Communicator, was released in 1996, creating a new category of multi-use devices called smartphones. In 1999 the first mobile internet service was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan under the i-Mode service. By 2007 over 798 million people around the world accessed the internet or equivalent mobile internet services such as WAP and i-Mode at least occasionally using a mobile phone rather than a personal computer.

== Cellular systems ==
Mobile phones receive and send radio signals with any number of cell site base stations fitted with microwave antennas. These sites are usually mounted on a tower, pole or building, located throughout populated areas, then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system. The phones have a low-power transceiver that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites, normally not more than 8 to 13 km (approximately 5 to 8 miles) away. In areas of low coverage, a cellular repeater may be used, which uses a long-distance high-gain dish antenna or yagi antenna to communicate with a cell tower far outside of normal range, and a repeater to rebroadcast on a small short-range local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly.

When the mobile phone or data device is turned on, it registers with the mobile telephone exchange, or switch, with its unique identifiers, and can then be alerted by the mobile switch when there is an incoming telephone call. The handset constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations, and is able to switch seamlessly between sites. As the user moves around the network, the &quot;handoffs&quot; are performed to allow the device to switch sites without interrupting the call.

Cell sites have relatively low-power (often only one or two watts) radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch. The switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same wireless service provider or to the public telephone network, which includes the networks of other wireless carriers. Many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments, particularly in scenic areas.

The dialogue between the handset and the cell site is a stream of digital data that includes digitised audio (except for the first generation analog networks). The technology that achieves this depends on the system which the mobile phone operator has adopted. The technologies are grouped by generation. The first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, are all analog and include AMPS and NMT. Second-generation systems, started in 1991 in Finland, are all digital and include GSM, CDMA and TDMA.

The GSM standard is a European initiative expressed at the CEPT (&quot;Conférence Européenne des Postes et Telecommunications&quot;, European Postal and Telecommunications conference). The Franco-German R&amp;D cooperation demonstrated the technical feasibility, and in 1987 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between 13 European countries who agreed to launch a commercial service by 1991. The first version of the GSM (=2G) standard had 6,000 pages. The IEEE/RSE awarded to Thomas Haug and Philippe Dupuis the 2018 James Clerk Maxwell medal for their contributions to the first digital mobile telephone standard. In 2018, the GSM was used by over 5 billion people in over 220 countries. The GSM (2G) has evolved into 3G, 4G and 5G. The standardisation body for GSM started at the CEPT Working Group GSM (Group Special Mobile) in 1982 under the umbrella of CEPT. In 1988, ETSI was established and all CEPT standardization activities were transferred to ETSI. Working Group GSM became Technical Committee GSM. In 1991, it became Technical Committee SMG (Special Mobile Group) when ETSI tasked the committee with UMTS (3G).

The nature of cellular technology renders many phones vulnerable to &#x27;cloning&#x27;: anytime a cell phone moves out of coverage (for example, in a road tunnel), when the signal is re-established, the phone sends out a &#x27;re-connect&#x27; signal to the nearest cell-tower, identifying itself and signalling that it is again ready to transmit. With the proper equipment, it is possible to intercept the re-connect signal and encode the data it contains into a &#x27;blank&#x27; phone—in all respects, the &#x27;blank&#x27; is then an exact duplicate of the real phone and any calls made on the &#x27;clone&#x27; will be charged to the original account. This problem was widespread with the first generation analogue technology, however the modern digital standards such as GSM greatly improve security and make cloning hard to achieve.

In an effort to limit the potential harm from having a transmitter close to the user&#x27;s body, the first fixed/mobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as &quot;car phones&quot; and &quot;bag phones&quot;) were limited to a maximum 3 watts Effective Radiated Power. Modern &quot;handheld&quot; cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user&#x27;s skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.

== Usage ==

=== By civilians ===

An increasing number of countries, particularly in Europe, now have more mobile phones than people. According to the figures from Eurostat, the European Union&#x27;s in-house statistical office, Luxembourg had the highest mobile phone penetration rate at 158 mobile subscriptions per 100 people, closely followed by Lithuania and Italy. In Hong Kong the penetration rate reached 139.8% of the population in July 2007. Over 50 countries have mobile phone subscription penetration rates higher than that of the population and the Western European average penetration rate was 110% in 2007 (source Informa 2007).

There are over five hundred million active mobile phone accounts in China, as of 2007, but the total penetration rate there still stands below 50%. The total number of mobile phone subscribers in the world was estimated at 2.14 billion in 2005. The subscriber count reached 2.7 billion by end of 2006 according to Information, and 3.3 billion by November, 2007, thus reaching an equivalent of over half the planet&#x27;s population. Around 80% of the world&#x27;s population has access to mobile phone coverage, as of 2006. This figure is expected to increase to 90% by 2010.

In some developing countries with little &quot;landline&quot; telephone infrastructure, mobile phone use has quadrupled in the last decade. The rise of mobile phone technology in developing countries is often cited as an example of the leapfrog effect. Many remote regions in the third world went from having no telecommunications infrastructure to having satellite based communications systems. At present, Africa has the largest growth rate of cellular subscribers in the world, its markets expanding nearly twice as fast as Asian markets.
The availability of prepaid or &#x27;pay-as-you-go&#x27; services, where the subscriber is not committed to a long-term contract, has helped fuel this growth in Africa as well as in other continents.

On a numerical basis, India is the largest growth market, adding about 6 million mobile phones every month. It currently has a mobile subscriber base of 937.06 million mobile phones.

=== Traffic ===

Since the world is operating quickly to 3G and 4G networks, mobile traffic through video is heading high. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the global traffic will reach an annual rate of 190 exabytes/year. This is the result of people shifting to smartphones.
It is predicted by 2018, mobile traffic will reach by 10 billion connections with 94% traffic comes from smartphones, laptops and tablets. Also 69% of mobile traffic will be from videos since we have high definition screens available in smart phones and 176.9 wearable devices to be at use. Apparently, 4G will be dominating the traffic by 51% of total mobile data by 2018.

=== By government agencies ===

==== Law enforcement ====

Law enforcement have used mobile phone evidence in a number of different ways. Evidence about the physical location of an individual at a given time can be obtained by triangulating the individual&#x27;s cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual&#x27;s cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over terrorism and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the British House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area. NIST have published guidelines and procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on mobile phones can be found under the NIST Publication SP800-101.

In the UK in 2000 it was claimed that recordings of mobile phone conversations made on the day of the Omagh bombing were crucial to the police investigation. In particular, calls made on two mobile phones which were tracked from south of the Irish border to Omagh and back on the day of the bombing, were considered of vital importance.

Further example of criminal investigations using mobile phones is the initial location and ultimate identification of the terrorists of the 2004 Madrid train bombings. In the attacks, mobile phones had been used to detonate the bombs. However, one of the bombs failed to detonate, and the SIM card in the corresponding mobile phone gave the first serious lead about the terrorists to investigators. By tracking the whereabouts of the SIM card and correlating other mobile phones that had been registered in those areas, police were able to locate the terrorists.

==== Disaster response ====

The Finnish government decided in 2005 that the fastest way to warn citizens of disasters was the mobile phone network. In Japan, mobile phone companies provide immediate notification of earthquakes and other natural disasters to their customers free of charge. In the event of an emergency, disaster response crews can locate trapped or injured people using the signals from their mobile phones. An interactive menu accessible through the phone&#x27;s web browser notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress. In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond cellular coverage, as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for free text messages when an AMBER Alert goes out for a missing person in their area.

However, most mobile phone networks operate close to capacity during normal times, and spikes in call volumes caused by widespread emergencies often overload the system just when it is needed the most. Examples reported in the media where this has occurred include the September 11, 2001 attacks, the 2003 Northeast blackouts, the 2005 London Tube bombings, Hurricane Katrina, the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, and the 2007 Minnesota bridge collapse.

Under FCC regulations, all mobile telephones must be capable of dialing emergency telephone numbers, regardless of the presence of a SIM card or the payment status of the account.

== Impact on society ==

=== Human health ===

Since the introduction of mobile phones, concerns (both scientific and public) have been raised about the potential health impacts from regular use. But by 2008, American mobile phones transmitted and received more text messages than phone calls. Numerous studies have reported no significant relationship between mobile phone use and health, but the effect of mobile phone usage on health continues to be an area of public concern.

For example, at the request of some of their customers, Verizon created usage controls that meter service and can switch phones off, so that children could get some sleep. There have also been attempts to limit use by persons operating moving trains or automobiles, coaches when writing to potential players on their teams, and movie theater audiences. By one measure, nearly 40% of automobile drivers aged 16 to 30 years old text while driving, and by another, 40% of teenagers said they could text blindfolded.

18 studies have been conducted on the link between cell phones and brain cancer; A review of these studies found that cell phone use of 10 years or more &quot;give a consistent pattern of an increased risk for acoustic neuroma and glioma&quot;. The tumors are found mostly on the side of the head that the mobile phone is in contact with. In July 2008, Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, warned about the radiation from mobile phones. He stated that there was no definitive proof of the link between mobile phones and brain tumors but there was enough studies that mobile phone usage should be reduced as a precaution. To reduce the amount of radiation being absorbed hands free devices can be used or texting could supplement calls. Calls could also be shortened or limit mobile phone usage in rural areas. Radiation is found to be higher in areas that are located away from mobile phone towers.

According to Reuters, The British Association of Dermatologists is warning of a rash occurring on people&#x27;s ears or cheeks caused by an allergic reaction from the nickel surface commonly found on mobile devices’ exteriors. There is also a theory it could even occur on the fingers if someone spends a lot of time text messaging on metal menu buttons. In 2008, Lionel Bercovitch of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and his colleagues tested 22 popular handsets from eight different manufacturers and found nickel on 10 of the devices.

=== Human behaviour ===

==== Culture and customs ====
Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the mobile phone has gone from being an expensive item used by the business elite to a pervasive, personal communications tool for the general population. In most countries, mobile phones outnumber land-line phones, with fixed landlines numbering 1.3 billion but mobile subscriptions 3.3 billion at the end of 2007.

In many markets from Japan and South Korea, to Europe, to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, most children age 8-9 have mobile phones and the new accounts are now opened for customers aged 6 and 7. Where mostly parents tend to give hand-me-down used phones to their youngest children, in Japan already new cameraphones are on the market whose target age group is under 10 years of age, introduced by KDDI in February 2007. The USA also lags on this measure, as in the US so far, about half of all children have mobile phones. In many young adults&#x27; households it has supplanted the land-line phone. Mobile phone usage is banned in some countries, such as North Korea and restricted in some other countries such as Burma.

Given the high levels of societal mobile phone service penetration, it is a key means for people to communicate with each other. The SMS feature spawned the &quot;texting&quot; sub-culture amongst younger users. In December 1993, the first person-to-person SMS text message was transmitted in Finland. Currently, texting is the most widely used data service; 1.8 billion users generated $80 billion of revenue in 2006 (source ITU). Many phones offer Instant Messenger services for simple, easy texting. Mobile phones have Internet service (e.g. NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode), offering text messaging via e-mail in Japan, South Korea, China, and India. Most mobile internet access is much different from computer access, featuring alerts, weather data, e-mail, search engines, instant messages, and game and music downloading; most mobile internet access is hurried and short.

Because mobile phones are often used publicly, social norms have been shown to play a major role in the usage of mobile phones. Furthermore, the mobile phone can be a fashion totem custom-decorated to reflect the owner&#x27;s personality and may be a part of their self-identity. This aspect of the mobile telephony business is, in itself, an industry, e.g. ringtone sales amounted to $3.5 billion in 2005.
Mobile phone use on aircraft is starting to be allowed with several airlines already offering the ability to use phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics. The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.

==== Etiquette ====

Mobile phone use can be an important matter of social discourtesy: phones ringing during funerals or weddings; in toilets, cinemas and theatres. Some book shops, libraries, bathrooms, cinemas, doctors&#x27; offices and places of worship prohibit their use, so that other patrons will not be disturbed by conversations. Some facilities install signal-jamming equipment to prevent their use, although in many countries, including the US, such equipment is illegal.

Many US cities with subway transit systems underground are studying or have implemented mobile phone reception in their tunnels for their riders, and trains, particularly those involving long-distance services, often offer a &quot;quiet carriage&quot; where phone use is prohibited, much like the designated non-smoking carriage of the past. Most schools in the United States and Europe and Canada have prohibited mobile phones in the classroom, or in school in an effort to limit class disruptions.

A working group made up of Finnish telephone companies, public transport operators and communications authorities has launched a campaign to remind mobile phone users of courtesy, especially when using mass transit—what to talk about on the phone, and how to. In particular, the campaign wants to impact loud mobile phone usage as well as calls regarding sensitive matters.

==== Use by drivers ====

The use of mobile phones by people who are driving has become increasingly common, for example as part of their job, as in the case of delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents.

Studies have found vastly different relative risks (RR). Two separate studies using case-crossover analysis each calculated RR at 4, while an epidemiological cohort study found RR, when adjusted for crash-risk exposure, of 1.11 for men and 1.21 for women.

A simulation study from the University of Utah Professor David Strayer compared drivers with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% to those conversing on a cell phone, and after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, the study concluded that cell phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers. Meta-analysis by The Canadian Automobile Association and The University of Illinois found that response time while using both hands-free and hand-held phones was approximately 0.5 standard deviations higher than normal driving (i.e., an average driver, while talking on a cell phone, has response times of a driver in roughly the 40th percentile).

Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than driving while using a hand-held phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies. epidemiological studies, simulation studies, and meta-analysis. Even with this information, California initiated new Wireless Communications Device Law (effective January 1, 2009) makes it an infraction to write, send, or read text-based communication on an electronic wireless communications device, such as a cell phone, while driving a motor vehicle. Two additional laws dealing with the use of wireless telephones while driving went into effect July 1, 2008. The first law prohibits all drivers from using a handheld wireless telephone while operating a motor vehicle. The law allows a driver to use a wireless telephone to make emergency calls to a law enforcement agency, a medical provider, the fire department, or other emergency services agency. The base fine for the FIRST offense is $20 and $50 for subsequent convictions. With penalty assessments, the fine can be more than triple the base fine amount. According to California Vehicle Code [VC] §23123, Motorists 18 and over may use a “hands-free device&quot;. The second law effective July 1, 2008, prohibits drivers under the age of 18 from using a wireless telephone or hands-free device while operating a motor vehicle (VC §23124). The consistency of increased crash risk between hands-free and hand-held phone use is at odds with legislation in over 30 countries that prohibit hand-held phone use but allow hands-free. Scientific literature is mixed on the dangers of talking on a phone versus those of talking with a passenger, with the Accident Research Unit at the University of Nottingham finding that the number of utterances was usually higher for mobile calls when compared to blindfolded and non-blindfolded passengers, but the University of Illinois meta-analysis concluding that passenger conversations were just as costly to driving performance as cell phone ones.

==== Use on aircraft ====

As of 2007, several airlines are experimenting with base station and antenna systems installed on the airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft&#x27;s base station. Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during takeoff and landing. Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration in the autumn of 2007. Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.

On March 20, 2008, an Emirates flight was the first time voice calls have been allowed in-flight on commercial airline flights. The breakthrough came after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the United Arab Emirates-based General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) granted full approval for the AeroMobile system to be used on Emirates. Passengers were able to make and receive voice calls as well as use text messaging. The system automatically came into operation as the Airbus A340-300 reached cruise altitude. Passengers wanting to use the service received a text message welcoming them to the AeroMobile system when they first switched their phones on. The approval by EASA has established that GSM phones are safe to use on airplanes, as the AeroMobile system does not require the modification of aircraft components deemed &quot;sensitive,&quot; nor does it require the use of modified phones.

In any case, there are inconsistencies between practices allowed by different airlines and even on the same airline in different countries. For example, Delta Air Lines may allow the use of mobile phones immediately after landing on a domestic flight within the US, whereas they may state &quot;not until the doors are open&quot; on an international flight arriving in the Netherlands. In April 2007 the US Federal Communications Commission officially prohibited passengers&#x27; use of cell phones during a flight.

In a similar vein, signs are put up in many countries, such as Canada, the UK and the U.S., at petrol stations prohibiting the use of mobile phones, due to possible safety issues. However, it is unlikely that mobile phone use can cause any problems, and in fact &quot;petrol station employees have themselves spread the rumour about alleged incidents.&quot;

=== Environmental impacts ===
Like all high structures, cellular antenna masts pose a hazard to low flying aircraft. Towers over a certain height or towers that are close to airports or heliports are normally required to have warning lights. There have been reports that warning lights on cellular masts, TV-towers and other high structures can attract and confuse birds. US authorities estimate that millions of birds are killed near communication towers in the country each year.

Some cellular antenna towers have been camouflaged to make them less obvious on the horizon, and make them look more like a tree.

An example of the way mobile phones and mobile networks have sometimes been perceived as a threat is the widely reported and later discredited claim that mobile phone masts are associated with the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) which has reduced bee hive numbers by up to 75% in many areas, especially near cities in the US. The Independent newspaper cited a scientific study claiming it provided evidence for the theory that mobile phone masts &quot;are&quot; a major cause in the collapse of bee populations, with controlled experiments demonstrating a rapid and catastrophic effect on individual hives near masts.
Mobile phones were in fact not covered in the study, and the original researchers have since emphatically disavowed any connection between their research, mobile phones, and CCD, specifically indicating that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created &quot;a horror story&quot;.
While the initial claim of damage to bees was widely reported, the corrections to the story were almost non-existent in the media.

There are more than 500 million used mobile phones in the US sitting on shelves or in landfills, and it is estimated that over 125 million will be discarded this year alone. The problem is growing at a rate of more than two million phones per week, putting tons of toxic waste into landfills daily. Several companies offer to buy back and recycle mobile phones from users. In the United States many unwanted but working mobile phones are donated to women&#x27;s shelters to allow emergency communication.

== Tariff models ==

=== Payment methods ===

There are two principal ways to pay for mobile telephony: the &#x27;pay-as-you-go&#x27; model where conversation time is purchased and added to a phone unit via an Internet account or in shops or ATMs, or the contract model where bills are paid by regular intervals after the service has been consumed. It is increasingly common for a consumer to purchase a basic package and then bolt-on services and functionality to create a subscription customised to the users needs.

Pay as you go (also known as &quot;pre-pay&quot; or &quot;prepaid&quot;) accounts were invented simultaneously in Portugal and Italy and today form more than half of all mobile phone subscriptions. USA, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, Israel and Finland are among the rare countries left where most phones are still contract-based.

=== Incoming call charges ===

In the early days of mobile telephony, the operators (carriers) charged for all air time consumed by the mobile phone user, which included both outbound and inbound telephone calls. As mobile phone adoption rates increased, competition between operators meant that some decided not to charge for incoming calls in some markets (also called &quot;calling party pays&quot;).

The European market adopted a calling party pays model throughout the GSM environment and soon various other GSM markets also started to emulate this model.

In Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, and the United States, it is common for the party receiving the call to be charged per minute, although a few carriers are beginning to offer unlimited received phone calls. This is called the &quot;Receiving Party Pays&quot; model. In China, it was reported that both of its two operators were to adopt the caller-pays approach as early as January 2007.

One disadvantage of the receiving party pays systems is that phone owners keep their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, which results in the total voice usage rates (and profits) in Calling Party Pays countries outperforming those in Receiving Party Pays countries. To avoid the problem of users keeping their phone turned off, most Receiving Party Pays countries have either switched to Calling Party Pays, or their carriers offer additional incentives such as a large number of monthly minutes at a sufficiently discounted rate to compensate for the inconvenience.

When a user roams in another country, international roaming tariffs apply to all calls received, regardless of the model adopted in the home country.

<doc id="1145895" wikidata="Q7561416" url="?curid=1145895" title="Songs for a Dying Planet">
<text>Songs for a Dying Planet is the tenth solo studio album by the American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Walsh. It was released in mid 1992, on the label Epic. Keen to re-establish himself after his ill-received 1991 album, &quot;Ordinary Average Guy&quot;, Walsh enlisted his former producer Bill Szymczyk. At the end of the track &quot;Certain Situations,&quot; one can hear a Morse code message that says &quot;Register and vote for me.&quot;

The album was received negatively by the majority of music critics and it was also a commercial disappointment, missing the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic, which called an end to Walsh&#x27;s solo career for 20 years before he released another solo album in 2012 called &quot;Analog Man.&quot; The song &quot;Vote for Me&quot; however was a minor success, peaking at number 10 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing for AllMusic, critic Vincent Jeffries wrote that the album &quot;fulfills [those] expectations to a degree, but the songwriter&#x27;s weakened comedic instincts and extreme sincerity make Songs for a Dying Planet a difficult recommendation.&quot;

<text>The Steel Pier is a 1,000-foot-long () amusement park built on a pier of the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey, across from the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City (formerly the Trump Taj Mahal). Built in 1897 and opened in 1898, it was one of the most popular venues in the United States for the first seven decades of the twentieth century, featuring concerts, exhibits, and an amusement park. It billed itself as the Showplace of the Nation and at its peak measured .

The pier is owned by the Catanoso Family and operates under the Steel Pier Associates, LLC name. The Catanosos had previously leased the pier to operate the amusement park before they purchased it. The Steel Pier continues to operate as an amusement pier and is one of the most successful family-oriented attractions in the city. The pier has twenty-four rides, a helicopter station, an arcade, food stands, and more. The pier had also been connected to the former Trump Taj Mahal through an overhead walking bridge.

==History==
The pier was built by the Steel Pier Company and opened on June 18, 1898. It was built on iron pilings, using a concrete understructure with steel girders. In 1904, a storm washed away part of Steel Pier, and many engineers stated that it could not be rebuilt. Atlantic City&#x27;s future mayor, Edward L. Bader, and his company accepted the challenge to rebuild it. His success with that job led to more work for him in Atlantic City.

In 1924, a fire caused significant damage to the pier. Frank Gravatt purchased the pier the following year and renovated it. He was called the &quot;salt water Barnum&quot; by the local newspaper. The restored pier hosted dance bands, three movie theaters, exhibits, operas, children&#x27;s shows, a water circus, stunts, and other attractions. Gravatt signed John Philip Sousa for a series of annual concerts. The General Motors Exhibit opened in 1926 and continued through 1933, when it was replaced by Ford. (General Motors returned in 1947 and continued until 1968.) From 1935 through 1938, the Steel Pier was where Miss America was crowned. It was described as &quot;An Amusement City at Sea&quot; and &quot;A Vacation in Itself.&quot; It also was once called the &quot;Showplace of the Nation&quot; and included such acts as the High Diving horse; Rex the Wonder Dog, the Human Cannonball, a water-skiing canine in the 1930s; the diving bell; and musicians, including Frank Sinatra and Al Jolson, among others. Diana Ross and The Supremes played week-long engagements during the summer in 1965, 1966, and 1967, to sold-out business in the Steel Pier&#x27;s Music Hall Theater and the Marine Ballroom. &quot;Rain or Shine ... There&#x27;s Always a Good Show on Steel Pier&quot; was another phrase used to describe the venue&#x27;s varied entertainment.

In 1945, the pier was purchased by George Hamid, who operated the competing Million Dollar Pier. He brought popular and rock and roll music to the pier, starting with Bill Haley and the Comets in 1955. Parts of the pier were damaged or lost during the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. The Beatles were booked in 1964, but overwhelming demand for tickets forced them to move to Boardwalk Hall. The pier used to be much longer, but a December 1969 fire six months before the opening of the 1970 season shortened its size by about a third.

By the end of the 1960s, the pier was feeling the effects of declining tourism in Atlantic City. The pier was sold to a group of local businessmen in 1973. After gambling was legalized, a developer proposed turning the pier into a hotel-casino. However, the necessary governmental approvals could not be obtained, and the pier was sold to Resorts International in 1978, which mainly used the pier for storage. The original wooden pier with steel underpinnings was destroyed in a 1982 fire; the current concrete structure dates from 1993. Trump Entertainment acquired ownership of the pier when it acquired the Trump Taj Mahal in the late 1980s. The Trump Steel Pier opened in 1992, but had been reduced to about and featured mainly amusement rides. The Steel Pier continues to operate as an amusement park to this day. When Trump acquired the steel pier, he connected it to his main casino and built a hub for tram car rides.

In June 2008, the Steel Pier celebrated its 110th anniversary, having originally opened on Saturday, June 18, 1898. All rides were free that day from midnight on June 18 to midnight on June 19.

In February 2012, it was announced that a diving horse act would return to the Steel Pier as part of the recently approved Tourism Master Plan, but the plan was soon scrapped after public outcry.

In 2017, a newer and bigger giant Ferris wheel was added to the pier. LEDs were also added to the new ferris wheel, and the ferris wheel shines from 4:30 to midnight every day.

Tickets for the Steel Pier cost $2.00 each. A book of 50 tickets with coupons is $65.00, amounting to a $35 discount. A book of 80 tickets with coupons is available as well for $85.00, amounting to $75 in savings.

<text>The 1998 [[National League Championship Series]] (NLCS), to determine the champion of the National League in Major League Baseball’s 1998 postseason, was played from October 7 to 14 between the East Division champion and top-seeded Atlanta Braves and the West Division champion and third-seeded San Diego Padres.

The Braves entered the playoffs for the seventh straight season with a franchise-record 106 regular season wins, an offense that hit 215 home runs, and a pitching staff made up of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Denny Neagle, and Kevin Millwood. The lowest win total for any of these five pitchers was Neagle at 16-11, with the other four winning 17, 17, 18, and 20 respectively. However, they also carried the baggage of their embarrassing NLCS loss to the Florida Marlins the previous season. In the NLDS, the Braves swept Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs.

After a 76–86 season in 1997, San Diego stormed out and took control of their division, finishing with a 98–64 record, their best in team history. The offense was led by the 50 home run club&#x27;s newest member, Greg Vaughn, and by Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn. The San Diego rotation was anchored by 18-game winner Kevin Brown, who helped Florida defeat Atlanta in the 1997 NLCS, along with All-Star Andy Ashby and the series MVP Sterling Hitchcock. Closer Trevor Hoffman saved an astounding 53 games in the regular season. The Padres defeated the favored Houston Astros in four games in the NLDS.

It was the seventh-consecutive NLCS appearance for the Braves and they would be heavily favored against the Padres, though their edge in the season series between the two teams was modest, having won 5 of 9.

The Padres won the series but would go on to the lose in a sweep to the New York Yankees in the World Series in four games.

This was the last NLCS trip for the Padres until 2022.

===Atlanta Braves vs. San Diego Padres===
==Game summaries==

===Game 1===
Wednesday, October 7, 1998, at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia
This game had a two-hour rain delay, starting the game at 10:16 p.m. EDT, instead of the planned 8:15 p.m. EDT.

With John Smoltz on the mound, the Braves struck first when Andruw Jones hit a home run to lead off the third inning off Andy Ashby. The Padres tied the game in the fifth when Tony Gwynn, appearing in his first NLCS since 1984, hit an RBI single with two on. Ruben Rivera doubled to lead off the eighth, then an error by first baseman Andrés Galarraga on Jim Leyritz&#x27;s ground ball off of Dennis Martinez helped San Diego take a 2–1 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, closer Trevor Hoffman came into the game early to end a Braves&#x27; scoring threat. However, in the ninth, the Braves got the tying run off him when Ryan Klesko, walked, moved to third on a single and scored on a sacrifice fly by Jones. In the tenth, Ken Caminiti belted a home run off reliever Kerry Ligtenberg to give San Diego their winning margin. The Braves put two men on via walks in the bottom of the inning, but Galarraga flew out to end the game.

===Game 2===
Thursday, October 8, 1998, at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia
After the tightly-contested Game 1, Kevin Brown, who was developing a reputation as a &quot;Brave killer&quot; pitched a three-hit shutout with 11 strikeouts. Tom Glavine matched Brown until the sixth, when San Diego hit three straight two-out singles, the last of which by Quilvio Veras brought in a run. San Diego added two insurance runs in the ninth off of Odalis Perez. Back-to-back leadoff singles and an error by catcher Javy Lopez put runners on first and third. Steve Finley&#x27;s RBI single scored a run. Then one out later with the bases loaded, Wally Joyner&#x27;s RBI single scored another before Brown pitched a perfect ninth and put the Braves down two games to none.

===Game 3===
Saturday, October 10, 1998, at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California
The Braves offense was held quiet again as San Diego won Game 3 and took a commanding 3–0 series lead. This was the only game won by the home team. Atlanta sent Greg Maddux to the hill and the Braves struck first in the third when Tony Graffanino drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on Maddux&#x27;s sacrifice bunt and scored on Walt Weiss&#x27;s single, but in the fifth, Sterling Hitchcock singled with one out, then one out later, scored on Steve Finley&#x27;s double to tie the game. After an intentional walk, Ken Caminiti&#x27;s RBI single put the Padres up 2–1. The Braves loaded the bases in the sixth with one out, but Donne Wall struck out Michael Tucker and Greg Colbrunn to end the threat. The Braves also loaded the bases in the eighth with one out, but again failed to score. In the bottom of the inning, Wally Joyner walked with two outs off of Rudy Seanez, then scored on Carlos Hernández&#x27;s double. Hernandez advanced to third on an error and scored on passed ball that padded the Padres&#x27; lead to 4–1. Trevor Hoffman struck out the side in the ninth and San Diego took Game 3 by a score of 4–1. Starter Sterling Hitchcock got the win with five innings pitched and one run allowed. Atlanta now appeared to be in an insurmountable hole—no team had ever come back from a three games to none deficit in baseball history. This was the last home postseason victory for the Padres until Game 2 of the 2020 National League Wild Card Series.

===Game 4===
Sunday, October 11, 1998, at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California
San Diego was looking for a sweep and took the first step by taking a 2–0 lead in the third. Quilvio Veras walked with one out off of Denny Neagle, then scored on Tony Gwynn&#x27;s double. After a single, Gwynn scored on Jim Leyritz&#x27;s single. The Braves cut the lead to 2–1 when Keith Lockhart hit a leadoff triple and scored on Chipper Jones&#x27;s single, then tied it in sixth on when Jones doubled with two outs and after a walk, scored on a Ryan Klesko RBI single, but San Diego retook the lead in the bottom of the inning when Jim Leyritz, two years removed from his crucial home run against the Braves in the 1996 World Series, hit a shot off Neagle. The Braves would refuse to go quietly, exploding for six runs in the seventh inning. Javy López led off with a home run, followed by an Andruw Jones single that ended the night for Padres starter Joey Hamilton. Jones moved to second on Randy Myers&#x27;s wild pitch, then to third on a groundout before scoring on Ozzie Guillén&#x27;s single to put the Braves up 4–3. A single and walk loaded the bases Dan Miceli relieved Myers and Andrés Galarraga launched a prodigious grand slam that left Atlanta ahead 8–3. The Braves, who used six pitchers in the win, avoided the sweep. They also became the first team since the 1970 Cincinnati Reds to win a post-season game after being down 3 games to none in the series, and the first to do it in a League Championship Series. It had been done three previous times in a World Series (1910, 1937, and 1970), and all of those teams had subsequently lost Game 5.

===Game 5===
Monday, October 12, 1998, at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California
After Atlanta&#x27;s offensive outburst in Game 4 to stay alive, the Padres hoped to close out the Braves in front of their home fans in Game 5. They sent Andy Ashby to the hill against Atlanta starter John Smoltz. Ken Caminiti got things started with a two-run homer off Smoltz to give San Diego a first inning lead. Three consecutive one-out singles in the fourth cut the lead to 2–1. Andruw Jones, who was caught stealing home in the fourth, stole second base in the fifth after singling with two outs, allowing himself to score on a Michael Tucker single to tie the game 2–2. However, John Vander Wal, who had five home runs all year, hit a two-run home run off Smoltz in the bottom of the inning after a two-out single that put San Diego back on top 4–2. After a single by Ozzie Guillén to start the seventh, manager Bruce Bochy brought starter Kevin Brown into the game. Brown retired the first three Braves he faced. The Padres threatened in the bottom of the seventh, but John Rocker came in for Smoltz and retired Tony Gwynn. Still holding a 4–2 lead, Brown was set to pitch the eighth for San Diego. He allowed the first two batters to reach but got Andruw Jones to pop out, bringing the Padres five outs away from a championship. Then Michael Tucker got a hold of a Brown fastball and launched a flyball to deep right center field that left the park and put Atlanta ahead 5–4. Bochy got Brown out of the game, replacing him with Donne Wall, who walked Rocker, then one out later, Tony Graffanino doubled, scoring another run, then crossed home himself when Chris Gomez committed a throwing error on the relay. Behind 7–4 and stunned, the Padres attempted to rally in the ninth. Greg Myers belted a pinch-hit two-run homer with no one out off of Kerry Ligtenberg to make it 7–6, prompting Bobby Cox to bring in Greg Maddux in relief. Maddux retired the side, with nemesis Tony Gwynn grounding out to finish the game, and earned his first ever career save. The save would be the only save in Maddux&#x27;s career. This wild game cut San Diego&#x27;s series lead to one game, and with the series returning to Atlanta with Tom Glavine set to pitch, many believed that the Braves had a serious chance of coming back. This Braves win marked the first time in baseball history that a team had come back from a three games to none (in a best of seven series) deficit to reach a Game 6.

===Game 6===
Wednesday, October 14, 1998, at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia
After Kevin Brown&#x27;s disastrous outing in Game 5, he was unable to come back for Game 6, forcing the Padres to instead start Sterling Hitchcock. The Braves had become the first team to force a Game 6 after dropping the first three games, and now had only to do what had been done many times before—win the final two at home. They had the right pitchers to accomplish this, giving themselves the best shot any team could have, but Hitchcock pitched five scoreless innings with eight strikeouts. Glavine looked good as well, matching Hitchcock zero for zero through that point, but ran into trouble in the sixth (the same inning that had doomed him in Game 6 exactly a year to the day prior against the Florida Marlins). After back-to-back one-out singles put runners on first and third, Jim Leyritz had an RBI groundout that scored the first run before Wally Joyner added a single that made it 2–0. A single and walk loaded the bases before Sterling Hitchcock reached on a costly error by left fielder Danny Bautista that scored two more runs. Glavine left the game and John Rocker promptly gave up an RBI single to Quilvio Veras. The unearned runs made it 5–0 and the San Diego bullpen would pitch a hitless final four innings. The Braves only managed two hits the entire game. Hitchcock, who won two games, was named the series MVP. It was their first pennant since 1984. To date, this is the Padres&#x27; most recent pennant.

<text>A mouthguard is a protective device for the mouth that covers the teeth and gums to prevent and reduce injury to the teeth, arches, lips and gums. An effective mouthguard is like a crash helmet for teeth and jaws. It also prevents the jaws coming together fully, thereby reducing the risk of jaw joint injuries and concussion. A mouthguard is most often used to prevent injury in contact sports, as a treatment for bruxism or TMD, or as part of certain dental procedures, such as tooth bleaching or sleep apnea treatment. Depending on the application, it may also be called a mouth protector, mouth piece, gumshield, gumguard, nightguard, occlusal splint, bite splint, or bite plane. The dentists who specialise in sports dentistry fabricate mouthguards.

==Types==

===Stock or ready made===
Manufactured in a pre-formed shape in various sizes but with nearly no adjustment to fit the user&#x27;s mouth. The only adjustment possible is minor trimming with a knife or scissors.

===Mouth adapted or &quot;boil and bite&quot;===
A thermoplastic material manufactured in a pre-formed shape in various sizes that can be adapted to fit more closely to an individual&#x27;s teeth and gums by heating and molding such as boiling then placing in the mouth. Some are now available that incorporate special fins within the fitting zones which increase retention and give an improved fit over traditional boil-and-bite mouth types. Guards are usually made of Ethylene-vinyl acetate, commonly known as EVA. Some of the newer technologies offer an alternative, stronger thermo-polymer that allows for lower molding temperatures, below 140F to prevent burning by scalding hot water. This is the most popular mouthguard used by amateur and semi-professional sportsmen, providing adequate protection but relatively low comfort in comparison to the custom-made guard.

===Custom-made===
An impression of the user&#x27;s teeth is used to create a best-fit mouth protector. The impression may be obtained by using a specially designed impression kit that uses dental putty, or from a dentist who will take an impression in dental alginate material. In the EU, the guard must be sold with a CE mark and the guard must have passed an EC Type-Examination test, performed by an accredited European Notified Body. 

*Vacuum form
**Custom-made mouth guards using this type of machine produce single layer mouth guards
**Fit not as good as pressure laminated but offers more protection than boil and bite
*Pressure laminated
**Custom-made mouth guards using this type of machine produce multi-layer mouth guards
**Offers superior fit, comfort and more protection
*Impressionless
**Made from a medical-grade thermo polymer, the guards are activated with hot (not boiling) water and create a custom comfort fit, completely unique to the shape of the mouth.
**1.6 mm thin, Remoldable, Works with braces, Stays secure in mouth during the entire game or practice
**Allows athletes to talk, breathe and drink naturally

===Dentistry===
Occlusal splints (also called bite splints, bite planes, or night guards) are removable dental appliances carefully molded to fit the upper or lower arches of teeth.

They are used to protect tooth and restoration surfaces, manage mandibular (jaw) dysfunction TMD, and stabilize the jaw joints during occlusion or create space prior to restoration procedures. People prone to nocturnal bruxism, or nighttime clenching, as well as morsicatio buccarum may routinely wear occlusal splints at night. However, a meta-analysis of occlusal splints used for this purpose concluded &quot;There is not enough evidence to state that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism. An indication of its use is questionable concerning sleep outcomes, but there may be some benefit with regard to tooth wear.&quot;

Occlusal splints are typically made of a heat-cured acrylic resin. Soft acrylic or light cured composite, or vinyl splints may be made more quickly and cheaply, but are not as durable, and are more commonly made for short-term use. Soft splints are also used for children because normal growth changes the fit of hard splints.

They cover all the teeth of the upper or lower arch, but partial coverage is sometimes used. Occlusal splints are usually used on either the upper or the lower teeth, termed maxillary splints or mandibular splints respectively, but sometimes both types are used at the same time. Maxillary splints are more common, although various situations favor mandibular splints.

Stabilizing or Michigan-type occlusal splints are generally flat against the opposing teeth, and help jaw muscle relaxation, while repositioning occlusal splints are used to reposition the jaw to improve occlusion.

==Usage==
*Dental trauma
**Mouthguards are used in sports where deliberate or accidental impacts to the face and jaw may cause harm. Such impacts may occur in many sports including baseball, boxing, mixed martial arts, puroresu, rugby, wrestling, football (soccer), gridiron football, Gaelic football, Australian football, lacrosse, basketball, figure skating, ice hockey, underwater hockey, field hockey, water polo, skiing, and snowboarding. Mouthguards may also prevent or reduce harm levels of concussion in the event of an injury to the jaw. In many sports, the rules of the sport make their use compulsory, or local health laws demand them. Schools also often have rules requiring their use. Studies in various high risk populations for dental injuries have repeatedly found low compliance with the prescribed regular use of mouthguard during activities. Moreover, even with regular use, effectiveness in prevention on dental trauma is not complete, and injuries can still occur even when mouthguards are used as users are not always aware of the best makes or size, resulting in a poor fit.
*Oral medicine
**Mouthguards may be used as splints to reduce strain over the temporomandibular joint in temporomandibular joint disorder
**To prevent tooth attrition in bruxism
**To deliver topical medication (e.g., corticosteroids) for chronic gingival diseases such as mucous membrane pemphigoid.
**As a therapeutic device in the treatment of morsicatio buccarum.
*Dental aesthetics
**During tooth bleaching
**As a night protector of thin porcelain bridges
*Orthodontics
**Transparent or clear aligner, which is basically an acrylic thermoplastic splints, used to correct a series of different malocclusions. Not all malocclusions can be corrected with transparent aligners, only mild and moderate malocclusions. They can be used alone or in combination with brackets. There are many brands.
**Two types of mouthguards, the mandibular advancement device (MAD) and the tongue stabilizing device (TSD), are used for treating sleep apnea and snoring

==History==
The exact origins of the mouthguard are unclear. Most evidence indicates that the concept of a mouthguard was initiated in the sport of boxing. Originally, boxers fashioned rudimentary mouthguards out of cotton, tape, sponge, or small pieces of wood. Boxers clenched the material between their teeth. These boxers had a hard time focusing on the fight and clenching their teeth at the same time. Since these devices proved impractical, Woolf Krause, a British dentist, began to fashion mouthpieces for boxers in 1892. Krause placed strips of a natural rubber resin, gutta-percha, over the maxillary incisors of boxers before they entered the ring. 
Phillip Krause, Woolf Krause’s son, is often credited with the first reusable mouthpiece. Phillip Krause’s invention was highlighted in a 1921 championship fight between Jack Britton and Ted &quot;Kid&quot; Lewis. Lewis was a school friend of Krause and the first professional to utilize the new technology, then called a ‘gum shield.’ During the fight, Britton’s manager successfully argued that the mouthpiece was an illegal advantage. Philip Krause was an amateur boxer himself and undoubtedly used his device before 1921.

There have been other claims to the invention of the mouthguard as well. In the early 1900s, Jacob Marks created a custom-fitted mouthguard in London. An American dentist, Thomas A. Carlos, also developed a mouth guard at approximately the same time as Krause. Carlos claimed that he made his first mouthpiece in 1916 and later suggested his invention to the United States Olympian Dinnie O’Keefe in 1919. Another dentist from Chicago, E. Allen Franke, also claimed to have made many mouth guards for boxers by 1919. 
The mouthguard’s relevance was again brought to the center of attention in a 1927 boxing match between Jack Sharkey and Mike McTigue. McTigue was winning for most of the fight, but a chipped tooth cut his lip, and he was forced to forfeit the match. From that point on, mouthguards were ruled acceptable and soon became commonplace for all boxers. In 1930, descriptions of mouthguards first appeared in dental literature. Dr. Clearance Mayer, a dentist and boxing inspector for the New York State Athletic Commission, described how custom mouthguards could be manufactured from impressions using wax and rubber. Steel springs were even recommended to reinforce soft materials.

In 1947, a Los Angeles dentist, Rodney O. Lilyquist, made a breakthrough by using transparent acrylic resin to form what he termed an &quot;acrylic splint&quot;. Molded to fit unobtrusively over the upper or lower teeth, the acrylic mouthguard was a distinct improvement over the thick mouthguard worn by boxers. It meant that the athlete could talk in a normal manner while the mouthguard was in place. In the January 1948 issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association, the procedure for making and fitting the acrylic mouthguard was described in detail by Dr. Lilyquist. He immediately received nationwide recognition as the father of the modern mouthguard for athletes. The first athlete to wear the acrylic mouthguard was a member of the UCLA basketball team, Dick Perry, who modeled the device at a convention of the Southern California Dental Association. Another early wearer was Frankie Albert, quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers.

In the 1940s and 1950s, dental injuries were responsible for 24-50% of all injuries in American football. In 1952, Life magazine did a report on Notre Dame football players without incisors. The article drew a lot of public attention and led to the inclusion of mouthguards in other contact sports. In the 1950s, the American Dental Association (ADA) began researching mouthguards and soon promoted their benefits to the public. In 1960, the ADA recommended the use of latex mouthguards in all contact sports. By 1962, all high school football players in the United States were required to wear mouthguards. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) followed suit in 1973 and made mouthguards mandatory in college football. Since the introduction of the mouthguard, the number of dental injuries has decreased dramatically.

Mouthguards have become a standard in many sports. In addition to football, the NCAA currently requires mouthguards in ice hockey, field hockey, and lacrosse. The ADA shows that mouthguards are extremely effective in preventing facial injury in contact and non-contact sports. The ADA recommends mouthguards be used in 29 sports: acrobatics, basketball, bicycling, boxing, equestrian, football, gymnastics, handball, ice hockey, inline skating, lacrosse, martial arts, racquetball, rugby football, shot putting, skateboarding, skiing, skydiving, soccer, softball, squash, surfing, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting and wrestling. Mouthguard use during Gaelic football games and training is mandatory at all levels.

Whitening is often desirable when teeth become yellowed over time for a number of reasons, and can be achieved by changing the intrinsic or extrinsic colour of the tooth enamel. The chemical degradation of the chromogens within or on the tooth is termed as bleaching.

Hydrogen peroxide () is the active ingredient most commonly used in whitening products and is delivered as either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is analogous to carbamide peroxide as it is released when the stable complex is in contact with water. When it diffuses into the tooth, hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidising agent that breaks down to produce unstable free radicals. In the spaces between the inorganic salts in tooth enamel, these unstable free radicals attach to organic pigment molecules resulting in small, less heavily pigmented components. Reflecting less light, these smaller molecules create a &quot;whitening effect&quot;. Peroxyacids are an alternative to hydrogen peroxide and also contribute to the breakdown of pigment molecules. There are different products available on the market to remove stains. For whitening treatment to be successful, dental professionals (dental hygienist or dentist) should correctly diagnose the type, intensity and location of the tooth discolouration. Time exposure and the concentration of the bleaching compound determines the tooth whitening endpoint.

==Natural shade==
The perception of tooth colour is multi-factorial. Reflection and absorption of light by the tooth can be influenced by a number of factors including specular transmission of light through the tooth; specular reflection at the surface; diffuse light reflection at the surface; absorption and scattering of light within the dental tissues; enamel mineral content; enamel thickness; dentine colour, the human observer, the fatigue of the eye, the type of incident light, and the presence of extrinsic and intrinsic stains. Additionally, the perceived brightness of the tooth can change depending on the brightness and colour of the background.

The combination of intrinsic colour and the presence of extrinsic stains on the tooth surface influence the colour and thus the overall appearance of teeth. The scattering of light and absorption within enamel and dentine determine the intrinsic colour of teeth and because the enamel is relatively translucent, the dentinal properties can play a major role in determining the overall tooth colour. On the other hand, extrinsic stain and colour is the result of coloured regions that have formed within the acquired pellicle on the enamel surface and can be influenced by lifestyle behaviours or habits. For example, dietary intake of tannin-rich foods, poor tooth brushing technique, tobacco products, and exposure to iron salts and chlorhexidine can darken the colour of a tooth.

With increasing age, teeth tend to grow darker in shade. This can be attributed to secondary dentin formation and thinning of enamel due to tooth wear which contributes to a significant decrease in lightness and increase in yellowness. Tooth shade is not influenced by gender or race.

==Staining and discolouration==
Tooth discolouration and staining is primarily due to two sources of stain: intrinsic and extrinsic (see Figure 2). In essence, tooth whitening primarily targets those intrinsic stains in which cannot be removed through mechanics such as a debridement (clean) or prophylaxis, in the dental office. Below explains in-depth the differences between the two sources of which contribute to such discolouration of the tooth&#x27;s surface. 

===Extrinsic staining===
Extrinsic staining, is largely due to environmental factors including smoking, pigments in beverages and foods, antibiotics, and metals such as iron or copper. Coloured compounds from these sources are adsorbed into acquired dental pellicle or directly onto the surface of the tooth causing a stain to appear.
* Dental plaque: Dental plaque is a clear biofilm of bacteria that naturally forms in the mouth, particularly along the gumline, and it occurs due to the normal development and defences of the immune system. Although usually virtually invisible on the tooth surface, plaque may become stained by chromogenic bacteria such as &quot;Actinomyces&quot; species. Prolonged dental plaque accumulation on the tooth surface can lead to enamel demineralisation and formation of white spot lesions which appear as an opaque milk-coloured lesion. The acidic by-products of fermentable carbohydrates derived from high-sugar foods contribute to greater proportions of bacteria, such as &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; in dental plaque. Higher consumption of fermentable carbohydrates will promote demineralisation and increase the risk of developing white spot lesions.
* Calculus: neglected plaque will eventually calcify, and lead to the formation of a hard deposit on the teeth, especially around the gumline. The organic matrix of dental plaque and calcified tissues undergo a series of chemical and morphological changes that lead to calcification of the dental plaque and therefore leading to the formation of calculus. The color of calculus varies, and may be grey, yellow, black, or brown. The colour of calculus depends on how long it has been present in the oral cavity for; it typically starts off yellow and over time the calculus will begin to stain a darker colour and become more tenacious and difficult to remove.
* Tobacco: tar in the smoke from tobacco products (and also smokeless tobacco products) tends to form a yellow-brown-black stain around the necks of the teeth above the gumline. The nicotine and tar in tobacco, combined with oxygen, turns yellow and over time will absorb into the pores of enamel and stain the teeth yellow. The dark brown to black stains along the gum line of the teeth are the result of the porous nature of calculus immediately picking up the stains from nicotine and tar.
* Betel chewing. Betel chewing produces blood-red saliva that stains the teeth red-brown to nearly black. The extract gel of betel leaf contain tannin, a chromogenic agent that causes discolouration of the tooth enamel.
* Tannin is also present in coffee, tea, and red wine and produces a chromogenic agent that can discolor teeth. Large consumptions of tannin-containing beverages stain the dental enamel brown due to the chromogenic nature.
* Certain foods, including curries and tomato-based sauces, can cause teeth staining.
* Certain topical medications: Chlorhexidine (antiseptic mouthwash) binds to tannins, meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee, tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining (i.e. removable staining) of teeth. Chlorhexidine mouthwash has a natural liking for sulphate and acidic groups commonly found in areas where plaque accumulates such as along the gumline, on the dorsum of the tongue and cavities. Chlorhexidine is retained in these areas and stain yellow-brown. The stains are not permanent and can be removed with proper brushing.
* Metallic compounds. Exposure to such metallic compounds may be in the form of medication or occupational exposure. Examples include iron (black stain), iodine (black), copper (green), nickel (green), and cadmium (yellow-brown). Sources of exposure to metal include placing metal into the oral cavity, metal-containing dust inhalation, or oral administration of drugs. Metals can enter the bony structure of the tooth, causing permanent discolouration, or can bind to the pellicle causing surface stain.

====Removal of extrinsic staining====
Extrinsic staining may be removed through various treatment methods:
* Prophylaxis: dental prophylaxis includes the removal of extrinsic staining using a slow-speed rotary handpiece and a rubber cup with abrasive paste, mostly containing fluoride. The abrasive nature of the prophy paste, as it is known, acts to remove extrinsic staining using the action of the slow-speed handpiece and the paste against the tooth. Adversely, the action of the rubber cup together with the abrasive nature of the paste, removes around one micron of enamel from the tooth surface every time a prophylaxis is performed. This method of stain removal may only take place in the dental office.
* Micro-abrasion: allows a dental professional to make use of an instrument which emits a powder, water and compressed air to remove biofilm, and extrinsic staining. This stain removal method can only be undertaken in a dental office, not at home.
* Toothpaste: there are many available on the market that implement both peroxide as well as abrasive particles, such as silica gel, to help remove extrinsic stains, while the peroxide acts on intrinsic staining. This method of stain removal may take place at home as well as in a dental office.

===Intrinsic staining===
Intrinsic staining primarily occurs during the tooth development either before birth or at early childhood. Intrinsic stains are those that cannot be removed through mechanical measures such as debridement or a prophylactic stain removal. As the age of the person increases, the teeth can also appear yellower over time. Below are examples of intrinsic sources of stains:
* Tooth wear and aging: Tooth wear is a progressive loss of enamel and dentine due to tooth erosion, abrasion and attrition. As enamel wears down, dentine becomes more apparent and chromogenic agents are penetrated in the tooth more easily. The natural production of secondary dentine also gradually darkens teeth with age.
* Dental cavities (tooth decay): The evidence regarding carious tooth discolouration is inconclusive, however the most reliable evidence suggests that carious lesion allows for exogenous agents to enter dentine and hence increased absorption of chromogenic agents causing discolouration to the tooth.
* Restorative materials: The materials used during root canal treatments, such as eugenol and phenolic compounds, contain pigment that stain dentine. Restorations using amalgam also penetrate dentine tubules with tin over time therefore causing dark stains to the tooth. 
* Dental trauma which may cause staining either as a result of pulp necrosis or internal resorption. Alternatively the tooth may become darker without pulp necrosis.
* Enamel hypoplasia: Enamel hypoplasia causes enamel to be thin and weak. It produces a yellow-brown discolouration and can also cause the enamel&#x27;s smooth surface to be rough and pitted which causes the tooth to be susceptible to extrinsic staining, tooth sensitivity, malocclusion, and dental cavities. The evidence regarding enamel hypoplasia is inconclusive, however the most likely cause is infection or trauma caused to the primary dentition. Disturbances to the developing tooth germ during neonatal and early childhood stages such as maternal vitamin D deficiency, infection, and medication intake can cause enamel hypoplasia.
* Pulpal hyperemia: Pulpal hyperemia refers to inflammation of a traumatised tooth which can be caused by a stimuli such as trauma, thermal shock, or dental cavities. Pulpal hyperemia is reversible and produces a red hue seen initially after trauma which has the ability to disappear if the tooth becomes revascularized.
* Fluorosis: Dental fluorosis causes enamel to become opaque, chalky white, and porous. The enamel can break down and cause the exposed subsurface enamel to become mottled and produce extrinsic dark brown-black stains. Dental fluorosis occurs due to excessive ingestion of fluoride or overexposure to fluoride during the development of enamel which usually occurs between the ages of one and four. Fluoridated drinking water, fluoride supplements, topical fluoride (fluoride toothpastes), and formula prescribed for children can increase the risk of dental fluorosis. Fluoride is considered an important factor in the management and prevention of dental cavities, the safe level for daily fluoride intake is 0.05 to 0.07 mg/kg/day.
* Dentinogenesis imperfecta: Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a hereditary dentine defect, associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, which causes the tooth to become discoloured usually blue or brown in colour and translucent giving teeth an opalescent sheen. The condition is autosomal dominant which means that the condition runs in the family.
* Amelogenesis imperfecta: The appearance of amelogenesis imperfecta depends on the type of amelogenesis, there are 14 different subtypes and can vary from the appearance of hypoplasia to hypomineralisation which can produce different appearances of enamel from white mottling to yellow brown appearances.
* Tetracycline and minocycline. Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and its derivative minocycline is common in the treatment of acne. The drug is able to chelate calcium ions and is incorporated into teeth, cartilage, and bone. Ingestion during the years of tooth development causes yellow-green discoloration of dentine visible through the enamel which is fluorescent under ultraviolet light. Later, the tetracycline is oxidized and the staining becomes more brown and no longer fluoresces under UV light.
* Porphyria: A rare metabolic disorder in which the body fails to adequately metabolise porphyrins, which leads to accumulation or excretion of porphyrins into teeth. The excretion of porphyrins produces purple-red pigments in teeth.
* Hemolytic disease of the newborn: This disease occurs when a newborn&#x27;s red blood cells are being attacked by antibodies from the mother caused by an incompatibility between the mother and baby&#x27;s blood. This condition can produce green staining of teeth due to jaundice, which is an inability to excrete bilirubin properly.
* Root resorption: Root resorption is clinically asymptomatic; however, it can produce a pink appearance at the amelocemental junction.
* Alkaptonuria: Metabolic disorder which promotes the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the body and may cause brown colour pigmentation in the teeth, gums, and buccal mucosa.

==Methods==
Prior to proceeding to tooth whitening alternatives, it is advised that the patient comes into the dental office to have a comprehensive oral examination that consists of a full medical, dental, and social history. This will allow the clinician to see if there is any treatment that needs to be done such as restorations to remove cavities, and to assess whether or not the patient will be a good candidate to have the whitening done. The clinician would then debride (clean) the tooth surface with an ultrasonic scaler, hand instruments, and potentially a prophy paste to remove extrinsic stains as mentioned above. This will allow a clean surface for maximum benefits of whichever tooth whitening method the patient chooses. Below will discuss the various types of tooth whitening methods including both internal application of bleaching and external application through the use of bleaching agents.

===In-office===

Before the treatment, the clinician should examine the patient: taking a health and dental history (including allergies and sensitivities), observe hard and soft tissues, placement and conditions of restorations, and sometimes x-rays to determine the nature and depth of possible irregularities. If this is not completed prior to the whitening agents being applied to the tooth surface, excessive sensitivity and other complications may occur.

The whitening shade guides are used to measure tooth colour. These shades determine the effectiveness of the whitening procedure, which may vary from two to seven shades. These shades may be reached after a single in office appointment, or may take longer, depending on the individual. The effects of bleaching can last for several months, but may vary depending on the lifestyle of the patient. Consuming tooth staining foods or drinks that have a strong colour may compromise effectiveness of the treatment. These include food and drinks containing tannins such as; coffee, tea, red wines, and curry.

In-office bleaching procedures generally use a light-cured protective layer that is carefully painted on the gums and papilla (the tips of the gums between the teeth) to reduce the risk of chemical burns to the soft tissues. The bleaching agent is either carbamide peroxide, which breaks down in the mouth to form hydrogen peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide itself. The bleaching gel typically contains between 10% and 44% carbamide peroxide, which is roughly equivalent to a 3% to 16% hydrogen peroxide concentration. The legal percentage of hydrogen peroxide allowed to be given is 0.1–6%. Bleaching agents are only allowed to be given by dental practitioners, dental therapists, and dental hygienists.

Bleaching is least effective when the original tooth color is grayish and may require custom bleaching trays. Bleaching is most effective with yellow discolored teeth. If heavy staining or tetracycline damage is present on a patient&#x27;s teeth, and whitening is ineffective (tetracycline staining may require prolonged bleaching, as it takes longer for the bleach to reach the dentine layer), there are other methods of masking the stain. Bonding, which also masks tooth stains, is when a thin coating of composite material is applied to the front of a person&#x27;s teeth and then cured with a blue light. A veneer can also mask tooth discoloration.

In-chair whitening is faster and more effective in comparison to the take-home bleaching options. Some clinicians also make custom bleaching trays, which can take up to a week to create. After the whitening treatment is completed, the patient is able to use these trays for maintenance of their bleaching with at-home kits or for use with desensitising products.

====Light-accelerated bleaching====
Power or light-accelerated bleaching uses light energy which is intended to accelerate the process of bleaching in a dental office. Different types of energy can be used in this procedure, with the most common being halogen, LED, or plasma arc. Use of light during bleaching increases the risk of tooth sensitivity and may not be any more effective than bleaching without light when high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used. A 2015 study showed that the use of a light activator does not improve bleaching, has no measurable effect, and rather is likely to increase the temperature of the associated tissues, resulting in damage.

The ideal source of energy should be high energy to excite the peroxide molecules without overheating the pulp of the tooth. Lights are typically within the blue light spectrum as this has been found to contain the most effective wavelengths for initiating the hydrogen peroxide reaction. A power bleaching treatment typically involves isolation of soft tissue with a resin-based, light-curable barrier, application of a professional dental-grade hydrogen peroxide whitening gel (25–38% hydrogen peroxide), and exposure to the light source for 6–15 minutes. Recent technical advances have minimized heat and UV emissions, allowing for a shorter patient preparation procedure.

For any whitening treatments, it is recommended that a comprehensive examination of the patient is done including the use of radiographs to aid in the diagnosis of the current condition of the mouth, including any allergies that may be present. The patient will need to have a healthy mouth and free of periodontal disease or cavities and to have had a debridement/clean done to remove any tartar or plaque build up.

It is recommended to avoid smoking, drinking red wine, eating or drinking any deeply coloured foods after this as the teeth may stain considerably straight after treatment.

==== Internal bleaching ====
Internal bleaching is a process which occurs after a tooth has been endodontically treated. This means that the tooth will have had the nerve of the tooth extirpated or removed through a root canal treatment at the dentist or by a specialist endodontist. Internal bleaching is often sought after in teeth which have been endodontically treated as tooth discolouration becomes a problem due to the lack of nerve supply to that tooth. It is common to have this internal bleaching done on an anterior tooth (a front tooth that you can see when smiling and talking). A way around this is by sealing off the bleaching agent inside the tooth itself and replacing it every few weeks until the desired shade has been achieved. The amount of time between appointments varies from patient to patient and with operator preference until the desired shade has been achieved. Even though this is a great option, the disadvantage of this treatment is a risk of internal root resorption of the tooth that is being internally bleached. This may not occur in every patient or every tooth, and its occurrence is difficult to determine prior to completing the treatment.

===At home===
At home tooth whitening products are available from dentists or &#x27;over the counter&#x27; (OTC). At home whitening methods include over-the-counter strips and gels, whitening rinses, whitening toothpastes, and tray-based tooth whiteners. OTC products can be used for milder cases of tooth staining. Home-based bleaching (following manufacturer&#x27;s instructions) results in less tooth sensitivity than in-office bleaching.

====Strips and gels====

The plastic whitening strips contain a thin layer of peroxide gel and are shaped to fit the buccal/labial surfaces of teeth. Many different types of whitening strips are available on the market, after being introduced in the late 1980s. Specific whitening strip products have their own set of instructions however the strips are typically applied twice daily for 30 minutes for 14 days. In several days, tooth colour can lighten by 1 or 2 shades. The tooth whitening endpoint does depend on the frequency of use and ingredients of the product.

Whitening gels are applied onto the tooth surface with a small brush. The gels contain peroxide and are recommended to be applied twice a day for 14 days. The tooth whitening endpoint like that of the whitening strips.

====Rinses====

Whitening rinses work by reaction of the oxygen sources such as hydrogen peroxide within the rinse and the chromogens on or within the tooth. It is recommended to use twice a day, rinsing for one minute. To see an improvement in shade colour, it can take up to three months.

====Toothpastes====

Whitening toothpastes differ from regular toothpastes in that they contain higher amounts of abrasives and detergents to be more effective at removing tougher stains. Some whitening toothpastes contain low concentrations of carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide which help lighten tooth colour however they do not contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite). With continuity of use over time, tooth colour can lighten by one or two shades.

====Tray-based====

Tray-based tooth whitening is achieved by wearing a fitted tray containing carbamide peroxide bleaching gel overnight or for two to four hours a day. If manufacturer&#x27;s instructions are followed, tooth whitening can occur within three days and lighten teeth by one or two shades. This type of tooth whitening is available over-the-counter and professionally from an oral health professional.

====Baking soda====

Baking soda is a safe, low abrasive, and effective stain removal and tooth whitening toothpaste. Tooth whitening toothpaste that have excessive abrasivity are harmful to dental tissue, therefore baking soda is a desirable alternative. To date, clinical studies on baking soda report that there have been no reported adverse effects. It also contains acid-buffering components that makes baking soda biologically antibacterial at high concentrations and capable of preventing growth of &quot;Streptococcus mutans.&quot; Baking soda might be useful for cavities-prone patients, as well as those who wish to have whiter teeth.

==Indications==
Tooth whitening may be undertaken for a variety of reasons, but whitening may also be recommended to some individuals by dental professionals.
* Intrinsic tooth staining
* Aesthetics
* Dental fluorosis
* Endodontic treatment (internal bleaching)
* Tetracycline staining

==Contraindications==
Some groups are advised to carry out tooth whitening with caution as they may be at higher risk of adverse effects.
* Patients with unrealistic expectations
* Allergy to peroxide
* Pre-existing sensitive teeth
* Cracks or exposed dentine
* Enamel development defects
* Acid erosion
* Receding gums (gingival recession) and yellow roots
* Sensitive gums
* Defective dental restorations
* Tooth decay. White-spot decalcification may be highlighted and become more noticeable directly following a whitening process, but with further applications the other parts of the teeth usually become more white and the spots less noticeable.
* Active periapical pathology
* Untreated periodontal disease
* Pregnant or lactating women
* Children under the age of 16. This is because the pulp chamber, or nerve of the tooth, is enlarged until this age. Tooth whitening under this condition could irritate the pulp or cause it to become sensitive. Younger people are also more susceptible to abusing bleaching.
* Persons with visible white fillings or crowns. Tooth whitening does not change the color of fillings and other restorative materials. It does not affect porcelain, other ceramics, or dental gold. However, it can slightly affect restorations made with composite materials, cements and dental amalgams. Tooth whitening will not restore color of fillings, porcelain, and other ceramics when they become stained by foods, drinks, and smoking, as these products are only effective on natural tooth structure. As such, a shade mismatch may be created as the natural tooth surfaces increase in whiteness and the restorations stay the same shade. Whitening agents do not work where bonding has been used and neither is it effective on tooth-colored filling materials. Other options to deal with such cases are the porcelain veneers or dental bonding.
* Individuals with poor oral hygiene

==Risks==
Some of the common side effects involved in teeth whitening are increased sensitivity of the teeth, gum irritation, and extrinsic teeth discolouration.

===Hypersensitivity===
The use of bleach with extremely low pH levels in the tooth whitening procedure may lead to hypersensitive teeth, as it causes the dentinal tubules to open. Exposure to cold, hot, or sweet stimuli may further exacerbate the intensity of the hypersensitive response. Amongst those who receive in-office whitening treatment, between 67 and 78% of the individuals experience sensitivity after the procedure where hydrogen peroxide and heat is utilized. Although it varies from person to person, sensitivity after whitening treatment can last up to 4–39 days.

Potassium nitrate and sodium fluoride in toothpastes are used to ease discomfort following bleaching, however, there is no evidence to suggest that this is a permanent method to eradicate the issue of hypersensitivity.

===Irritation of mucous membranes===
Hydrogen peroxide is an irritant and cytotoxic. Hydrogen peroxide with concentrations of 10% or higher can cause tissue damage, be corrosive to mucous membranes and cause burning sensation to the skin. Chemical burns can commonly occur whilst bleaching, irritation and discolouration of the mucous membranes may occur if a high concentration of oxidising agent comes in to contact with unprotected tissue. Poorly fitting bleaching trays are amongst the most common reasons for chemical burns. The temporary burning induced by whitening treatments can be reduced by using custom-made plastic trays or nightguards provided by the dental professional. This prevents the leakage of solution onto the surrounding mucosa.

===Uneven results===
Uneven results are quite common after bleaching. Consuming less foods and drinks that cause surface staining of teeth can contribute to attaining a good result from tooth whitening.

===Return to original pre-treatment shade===
Nearly half the initial change in colour provided by an intensive in-office treatment (i.e., one hour treatment in a dentist&#x27;s chair) may be lost in seven days. Rebound is experienced when a large proportion of the tooth whitening has come from tooth dehydration (also a significant factor in causing sensitivity). As the tooth rehydrates, tooth colour &quot;rebounds&quot;, back toward where it started.

===Over-bleaching===
Over-bleaching, more often known as the &quot;bleached effect&quot;, occurs among treatments that promise a large change over a short period of time e.g., hours. Over-bleaching can emit a translucent and brittle appearance.

===Damage to enamel===
Teeth enamel can have an adverse negative effect by whitening treatment. Evidence from studies show that carbamide peroxide present in whitening gels can damage the enamel surface. Although this effect is not as damaging as phosphoric acid etch, the increased irregularity of the teeth surface makes the teeth more susceptible to extrinsic staining, thus having an increased detrimental effect on the aesthetics. The increased porosity and changes in surface roughness may have an impact on the formation of supra- and subgingival plaque, thus increasing the adhesion of bacterial species such as &quot;Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus,&quot; significant contributors to dental cavities. Dental restorations are susceptible to unacceptable colour change even when using the home-based systems.

===Weakened dentine===
Intracoronal bleaching is a tooth whitening method that uses 30% more hydrogen peroxide. Such tooth whitening methods can weaken the mechanical properties of dentine and could potentially lead to severe tooth sensitivity.

===Effects on existing restorations===
Dental restorations are susceptible to unacceptable colour change even when using the home-based systems.

Ceramic crowns – aggressive bleaching can chemically react with ceramic crowns and reduce their stability.

Dental amalgam – exposure to carbamide peroxide solutions increase mercury release for one to two days. The release of amalgam components is said to be due to active oxidation. This increase in amalgam mercury release is proportional to the concentration of carbamide peroxide.

Resin composite – bond strength between enamel and resin based fillings become weakened. Many studies have found that 10-16% carbamide peroxide tooth bleaching gels (containing approximately 3.6–5.76% hydrogen peroxide) leads to an increase in the surface roughness and porosity of composite resins. However, the saliva may exert a protective effect. In addition, changes in the reflectance of the composite have been analysed following whitening with high concentration (30-35%) hydrogen peroxide. This suggests that tooth whitening negatively impacts composite resin restorations.

Glass ionomer and other cements – studies suggest that solubility of these materials may increase.

===Bleachorexia===
Bleachorexia is the term that is used to describe an individual that develops an unhealthy obsession with teeth whitening. This condition is similar to body dysmorphic disorder. The characteristics of bleachorexia are the continuous use of whitening products even though the teeth cannot possibly become whiter, despite the provision of repeated treatment. A person with bleachorexia will continually seek out for different whitening products, hence, it is recommended that a target shade is agreed upon before starting the treatment procedure to help with this problem.

=== Home teeth whitening risks ===
The use of personalised home whitening trays is a patient administered therapy that is prescribed and dispensed by a dentist. Patients need to actively participate in their treatment and follow the guidelines given by the dentist accurately. Erratic or inaccurate use of the bleaching trays could cause harm to the patient such as blistering or sensitivity of the teeth and the surrounding soft tissue. Inconsistent use of the bleaching trays can lead to the slowing and irregularity of the whitening process. Some patients with a substantial gag reflex may not be able to tolerate the trays and would need to consider other methods of teeth whitening.

===Specific ingredient-based side effects===
====Hydrogen Peroxide-based Bleaching Agents====
Hydrogen peroxide-based bleaching agents are always associated with Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The free radicals diffuse through the enamel and dentin and break down the color molecules, resulting in the perception of a whiter tooth color. The downside is that these radicals have certain local harmful effects, such as enamel erosion, changes in the microhardness of the teeth, gum irritation, post-bleaching hypersensitivity, and burning sensations. The following side effects are also known:
* Even during treatment, there is often very painful sensitivity to the bleaching agent. Freshly treated teeth can be sensitive to sweets, acids, and temperature, which can be quite painful. However, these symptoms are usually temporary and subside within a few days after treatment.
* The long-term effects of higher concentration bleaching agents (&gt;6% H₂O₂ or equivalent) on the pulp, dentin, enamel, and oral soft tissues are not yet clarified. These bleaching agents are potentially harmful and should be used with caution only in dental practice.
* Bleaching can deplete minerals from the teeth, leading to demineralization and the temporary breakdown of the protein pellicle (the protective layer of the tooth). This can result in more or less pronounced white spots, which usually normalize within days after treatment. Remineralization can be supported by special gels.
* Bleaching can weaken the tooth structure. Internal bleaching can lead to tooth brittleness and root resorption.

====Peroxycarboxylic Acids-Based Bleaching Agents====
Bleaching agents based on peroxycarboxylic acids (PAP) can be chosen as an effective vehicle for tooth whitening. PAP has proven to be almost harmless to enamel with a safe and reliable bleaching effect. In the clinical application of PAP for tooth whitening, oxidation reactions also occur, and color molecules are bleached through chemical-physical processes. However, the reaction occurs without the formation of free radicals. This is the major and decisive difference, as free radicals are the main cause of tooth sensitivity and gum irritation in tooth whitening with hydrogen peroxide-based bleaching agents.

===Other risks===
Evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide might act as a tumour promoter. Although cervical root resorption is more evidently observed in thermocatalytic bleaching methods, intracoronal internal bleaching may also lead to tooth root resorption. Moreover, severe damage to intracoronal dentine and tooth crown fracture can occur due to this bleaching method.

However, the International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to prove that hydrogen peroxide is a carcinogen to humans. Recently, the genotoxic potential of hydrogen peroxide was evaluated. The results indicated that the oral health products that contain or release hydrogen peroxide up to 3.6% will not increase the cancerous risk of an individual, hence, it is safe to use in moderation.

==Maintenance==
Despite achieving the results of treatment, stains can return within an initial couple of months of treatment. Various methods may be employed to prolong the treatment results, such as:
* Brush or flush out mouth with water after eating and drinking
* Floss to remove plaque and biofilms between the teeth
* Take special care during the first 2 days – the first 24–48 hours after the whitening procedure is seen as the most crucial period in which you must protect for your teeth the most. Hence, it is vital that non-staining drinks or foods are eaten during this time as enamel is prone to adhere to stains.
* Drink fluids that may cause staining through a straw
* Depending on the method used to whiten the teeth, re-treatment every six months or after a year may be required. If an individual is a smoker or they consume beverages with the capacity to stain, regular re-treatments would be required.

==History==
Teeth whitening remedies have been present since ancient times. Despite seeming absurd, some methods were somewhat effective in their results.

Ancient Roman dentists believed in using urine with goat milk to make their teeth look whiter. Pearly white teeth symbolized beauty and marked wealth. In the Auyrveda medicine system, oil pulling was used as an oral therapy. For this process today, swish coconut or olive oil in your mouth for up to 20 minutes each day. In the late 17th century, many people reached out to barbers, who used a file to file down the teeth before applying an acid that would, in fact, whiten the teeth. Although the procedure was successful, the teeth would become completely eroded and more prone to becoming decayed. Guy de Chauliac suggested the following to whiten the teeth: &quot;Clean the teeth gently with a mixture of honey and burnt salt to which some vinegar has been added.&quot; In 1877, oxalic acid was proposed for whitening, followed by calcium hypochlorite.

In the late 1920s, mouthwash containing pyrozone (ether peroxide) was found to reduce cavities while providing a whiter appearance to the teeth. By 1940s and 1950s, ether and hydrogen peroxide gels were used to whiten vital teeth, whereas non-vital teeth were whitened using pyrozone and sodium perborate.

In the late 1960s, Dr William Klusmeier, an Orthodontist from Fort Smith, Arkansas, introduced the custom tray bleaching. However, it was not until 1989 that Haywood and Heymann published an article in support of this method. Carbamide peroxide with a shelf life of one to two years, as opposed to hydrogen peroxide with a shelf life one to two months, was seen as a more stable agent for whitening teeth.

==Society and culture==
Teeth whitening has become the most promoted and mentioned methodology in cosmetic dentistry. In excess of 100 million Americans brighten their teeth using different methods; spending $15 billion in 2010. The US Food and Drug Administration only endorses gels that are under 6% hydrogen peroxide or 16% or less of carbamide peroxide. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety of the EU consider gels containing higher fixations can be dangerous.

As per European Council guidelines, only a certified dental professional can lawfully give tooth whitening products utilizing 0.1–6% hydrogen peroxide, provided the patient is 18 years of age or older. In 2010, the UK General Dental Council became concerned of the &quot;risk to patient safety from poor quality tooth whitening being carried out by untrained or poorly trained staff.&quot; A public attitudes survey, conducted by the GDC, showed that 83% of people support &quot;policies of regulating tooth whitening to protect patient safety and prosecuting illegal practice.&quot; A group of dental professionals and associations called The Tooth Whitening Information Group (TWIG) was founded to advance protected and beneficial tooth whitening information and assistance to the general population. Reports can be made to the TWIG through their website with respect to any individual giving unlawful tooth whitening services, or if an individual has personally undergone treatment done by a non-dental professional.

In Brazil, all whitening items are classed as cosmetics (Degree II). There are worries that this will increase abuse of whitening products and thus there have been calls for reanalysis.

According to research, tooth whitening can produce positive changes in young participants&#x27; Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) in aesthetic areas such as smiling, laughing, and showing teeth without embarrassment. However, its main side-effect, tooth sensitivity, negatively affects quality of life.

<doc id="1145914" wikidata="Q1422780" url="?curid=1145914" title="Nexum">
<text>Nexum was a debt bondage contract in the early Roman Republic. A debtor pledged his person as collateral if he defaulted on his loan. Details as to the contract are obscure and some modern scholars dispute its existence. It was allegedly abolished either in 326 or 313 BC.

== Contract ==

Nexum was a form of &quot;mancipatio&quot;, a symbolic transfer of rights that involved a set of scales, copper weights and a formulaic oath. It remains unclear whether debtors entered into a &quot;nexum&quot; contract initially with their loan or if they voluntarily did so after they could not pay off an existing debt. Nor is it clear how &quot;nexum&quot; absolved a debt: a &quot;nexus&quot; may have been required to labour until repayment of debt, labour in lieu of interest on debt, or labour in lieu of payment itself. In the last case, the debt would have been &quot;worked off&quot;. It is also possible that a debtor may have had their debts repaid by a third party in exchange for becoming a bondsman of that third party.

In any case, such contracts were voluntary – in contrast to standard debt bondage in which a person was enslaved for failure to pay debts – and it is likely that a person reduced to bondage probably remained there permanently. Additionally, it is possible that there were many variations of the &quot;nexum&quot; contract, and that the details of &quot;nexum&quot; contracts were worked out on a case-by-case basis.

The purpose of the contract is also unclear. If it was not a means to repay debt through labour in lieu of payment, it may have been a signal to ensure prompt repayment in allowing a creditor to &quot;proceed with personal execution on the debtor&quot; if the borrower did not repay promptly. Some scholars doubt &quot;nexum&quot;&#x27;s specific existence.

Despite constraining a free person&#x27;s liberty (&quot;libertas&quot;), &quot;nexum&quot; was probably preferred to slavery or death for debtors: non-repayment of debts under the Twelve Tables resulted either in the total loss of citizenship rights through enslavement and sale across the Tiber or in the physical cutting up of the debtor&#x27;s body. Though &quot;nexi&quot; were often beaten and abused by their creditors, they maintained (if sometimes only in theory) their Roman citizenship and rights. Creditors might profit more from a &quot;nexum&quot; contract, as they received a motivated contractual worker instead of a slave. An indebted &quot;paterfamilias&quot;, or legal head of the Roman household, might offer his son for &quot;nexum&quot;, instead of himself.

== History ==

Debt bondage was common both in Rome and other archaic societies as a consequence of poverty coupled with the limited and variable carrying capacity of the land. The traditional accounts of the early Republic, with their depiction of the patriciate&#x27;s domination over Roman public land (), imply that inequality in land ownership forced peasants into exploitative servitude to work land for the patriciate. Livy&#x27;s narrative of the Gallic sack of Rome implies that many farmers became destitute due to disruption by the enemy army and, in the aftermath, he recounts agitation to free the plebs from bondage.

According to the Augustan-era historian Livy, &quot;nexum&quot; was abolished because of the excessive cruelty and lust of a single usurer, Lucius Papirius. He reports that in 326 BC, a young boy named Gaius Publilius was a guarantor to his father&#x27;s debt, becoming the &quot;nexus&quot; of Papirius. In another version, Dionysius of Halicarnassus records that Publilius borrowed the money for his father&#x27;s funeral. The boy was noted for his youth and beauty, and Papirius desired him sexually. He tried to seduce Publilius; when rejected, Papirius grew impatient and reminded the boy of his position as bondsman and had him stripped and lashed. The wounded boy ran into the street, and an outcry among the people led the consuls to pass the &quot;lex Poetelia Papiria&quot;, which forbade holding debtors in bondage for their debt, and required instead that the debtor&#x27;s property be used as collateral. All people confined under the &quot;nexum&quot; contract were released, and &quot;nexum&quot; as a form of legal contract was forbidden thereafter.

Marcus Terentius Varro alternatively dates the abolishment of &quot;nexum&quot; to 313 BC, during the dictatorship of Gaius Poetelius Libo Visolus, who would have been the homonymous son of the Poetelius, who was consul in 326 BC.

Modern views of &quot;nexum&quot;″s abolition also relate to the structural economic forces of Roman conquest: the success of Roman arms by the time of the Second Samnite war would have produced large amount of free land on which Roman colonists were settled with a corresponding influx of slaves to substitute for indigenous bond labour, making &quot;nexum&quot; &quot;a relic of a bygone age&quot;.

Cicero considered the abolishment of the &quot;nexum&quot; primarily a political maneuver to temporarily appease the plebeian masses, who by Cicero&#x27;s time (some three hundred years after any alleged &quot;lex Poetelia Papiria&quot;) were believed to have carried out three full-scale secessions:
When the plebeians have been so weakened by the expenditures brought on by a public calamity that they give way under their burden, some relief or remedy has been sought for the difficulties of this class, for the sake of the safety of the whole body of citizens.
Although the &quot;lex Poetelia&quot; ostensibly abolished imprisonment for debts, debt bondage continued in Rome for long after. Courts could still grant creditors the right to take insolvent debtors as bond slaves after a judgement so ordering.

== Etymology ==
Varro derives the word &quot;nexum&quot; from &quot;nec suum&quot;, &quot;not one&#x27;s own&quot; and although that etymology is incorrect in light of modern scientific linguistics, it illuminates how the Roman understood the term.

Lewis and Short, an 1879 Latin dictionary, derives the word instead from the verb meaning &quot;I bind&quot;.

<text>Michael Andrew Sembello (born April 17, 1954) is an American singer, guitarist, keyboardist, songwriter, composer and producer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Sembello was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his 1983 song &quot;Maniac&quot;, which he sang and co-wrote. The song reached number one in the United States and featured in the &quot;Flashdance&quot; film soundtrack.

==Early life==
Sembello was born and raised in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, a western suburb of Philadelphia.

==Career==
Sembello began his career in music as a session musician, working as a guitarist. By age 17, he was working professionally with Stevie Wonder on electric and acoustic guitar as a studio player on Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot;. He continued the same year, chosen as one of the core artists who worked on &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;, an ambitious double album that took two years to create. He was credited as lead and rhythm guitarist on most of the tracks—including the intricate jazz rock lead guitar part of the instrumental &quot;Contusion&quot;—and shares songwriting credit with Wonder on the song &quot;Saturn&quot;, according to the album&#x27;s liner notes.

Sembello wrote the song &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, a sizable hit for Diana Ross in 1981 (No. 2 on the soul singles chart and peaking at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100) and the song &quot;Carousel&quot;, which Michael Jackson recorded for his 1982 album &quot;Thriller&quot;, but it was replaced on the track list by &quot;Human Nature&quot;.

The song was included as a bonus track on &quot;Thriller 25&quot;, the 25th-anniversary edition reissue of the album; the full version was released on iTunes in 2013 as part of The Ultimate Fan Extras Collection.

Sembello released his first solo album &quot;Bossa Nova Hotel&quot; in 1983. The song &quot;Maniac&quot; from that album, which he co-wrote with his keyboardist Dennis Matkosky, was selected for inclusion in the film &quot;Flashdance&quot;. &quot;Maniac&quot; was the second-best-charting song from the soundtrack (after the title track) and the ninth-biggest single of 1983. That soundtrack won a Grammy Award in 1984 for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special. Sembello and Matkosky have claimed that the song was supposed to be about a vicious pet murderer after having seen a slasher flick, possibly &quot;Maniac&quot; or &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. In 2020, Sembello, along with Matkosky, appeared in &quot;Maniac Men&quot;, an interview included on the 4K UHD Blu-ray reissue of &quot;Maniac&quot;.

Sembello produced guitarist Jennifer Batten&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Above Below and Beyond&quot; in 1992. In 1994, he produced Argentine singer Valeria Lynch&#x27;s album &quot;Caravana de Sueños&quot; (1994), and co-wrote the title song with lyricist César Isella and composer Armando Tejada Gómez.

Sembello&#x27;s songs are featured in the films &quot;Cocoon&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;The Monster Squad&quot; and &quot;Summer Lovers&quot;. His song &quot;Gravity&quot; from &quot;Cocoon&quot; was accompanied by a music video directed by the film&#x27;s director Ron Howard and included an appearance by Howard in a scripted fictional foreword to the video.

In 2008, Sembello worked with saxophonist Michael Lington on his album &quot;Heat&quot;, nominated as Jazztrax Album of the Year for 2008. Michael and his brother Danny Sembello penned three songs with Lington for the project.

May 2009, Sembello assembled Bruce Gaitsch (bass, guitar) and Janey Clewer (keyboards, vocals) to form the trio The Bossa Nova Hotel, named after his 1983 Warner Bros. Records debut. They recorded the album &quot;Moon Island&quot;, released on EMI Japan. The album consists of American pop songs given arrangements with a strong Brazilian influence.

Shortly after The Bossa Nova Hotel&#x27;s rendition of the jazz standard &quot;Manhã de Carnaval&quot; enjoyed success as the theme to the Japanese television series, &quot;LIFE!&quot;, the trio regrouped in 2016 to record a cover of Sting&#x27;s &quot;Fragile&quot;.

Sembello has recorded his vocals in six languages.

==Personal life==
Sembello is the brother of the late songwriters Danny (1963–2015) and John Sembello (1945–2013).

<doc id="1145923" wikidata="Q837731" url="?curid=1145923" title="1992–93 FA Premier League">
<text>The 1992–93 FA Premier League was the inaugural season of the Premier League, the top division of English football. The season began on 15 August 1992 and ended on 11 May 1993. The league was made up of the 22 clubs that broke away from the Football League at the end of the 1991–92 season. The new league was backed up by a five-year, £304 million deal with Sky to televise Premier League matches. In concept, the Premier League was identical to the old First Division of the Football League, which was now reduced to three divisions.

==Overview==

===Background===

In May 1992, the breakaway league signed a broadcasting rights contract with Sky and the BBC valued at £304 million, the largest such agreement in the history of British sport. The league&#x27;s executive committee was unable, however, to secure title sponsorship for the new competition after eight clubs blocked a proposed £13 million deal with brewers Bass. Nonetheless, clubs began to utilise their dramatically increased wealth to fund a series of high-profile transfers.

Although the idea of a super league had been mentioned by football&#x27;s governing bodies and evaluated by the media since the mid-1980s, plans for a new Premier League of 22 clubs were first unveiled by the Football Association in October 1990, and included in the Football Association&#x27;s &quot;Blueprint for the Future of Football&quot;, published in June 1991. The majority of First Division clubs, particularly long-established top clubs including Arsenal and Manchester United, were in favour of a breakaway from the Football League, although Football League president Bill Fox criticised the planned Premier League as an attempt by the Football Association to &quot;hijack&quot; the First Division. 

Shortly before the season began, newly promoted Blackburn Rovers signed Southampton&#x27;s 21-year-old England international striker Alan Shearer for a new British record fee variously reported as £3.3 million, £3.4 million, or £3.6 million. Several other players moved for fees of £2 million or more, including Arsenal&#x27;s David Rocastle, who joined Leeds United, Dean Saunders, who moved from Liverpool to Aston Villa, and Teddy Sheringham, who left Nottingham Forest for Tottenham Hotspur.

The structure of the new league was identical to that of the previous season&#x27;s Football League First Division, comprising 22 teams, with each playing the other 21 twice for a total of 42 matches. Ipswich Town and Middlesbrough had been promoted from the old Second Division as champions and runners-up respectively, and Blackburn Rovers took the third promotion place after winning the 1991–92 Second Division play-off.

===Season summary===
The first Premier League title went to Manchester United, the club&#x27;s first title in 26 years. Their title was achieved with a 10-point lead over runners-up Aston Villa, after overcoming a slow start to the season which had seen them slip to mid table, with the signing of French striker Eric Cantona in late November proving to be the catalyst for their improved form which saw them lose just two league games after his arrival.

Norwich City led the table for most of the first half of the season, but their challenge faded in the final weeks of the campaign, and were out of contention with three games remaining, after they lost 3–1 to Ipswich Town. Norwich did however finish in third place, achieving European qualification in Mike Walker&#x27;s debut season as manager; with a goal difference of −4, this is the highest Premier League finish by a team with a negative goal difference. Blackburn, in the top division for the first time in almost 30 years, finished in fourth place. They briefly led the league early in the season, but suffered a shortage of goals after Alan Shearer, who had scored 16 times before the turn of the year, suffered a torn cruciate ligament and missed the second half of the season. The title race was largely between the clubs who finished in the top four after early challenges from the likes of Arsenal, Coventry City, and Queens Park Rangers were not sustained.

Nottingham Forest&#x27;s league form had suffered through the sale of key players including Des Walker and Teddy Sheringham, and they were bottom of the Premier League for the majority of the season. Their relegation was confirmed in early May when they lost to Sheffield United, and manager Brian Clough announced his retirement after 18 years as manager, which had yielded one league title, two European Cups and four League Cups. Next to go were newly promoted Middlesbrough, who fell from mid-table at Christmas to go down in second from bottom place. Last to go down were Crystal Palace, who failed to win their final game of the season which would have instead consigned Oldham Athletic to the final relegation place - Oldham&#x27;s survival was secured with a thrilling 4–3 win over Southampton.

Title holders Leeds United finished 17th, which was the lowest finish from a defending league champion since Ipswich Town finished 17th in 1962–63 after having won the title in 1961–62, and the lowest any top tier champions have so far finished in the Premier League. Leeds failed to win an away game in the league. The lowest a defending champion has finished since then has been 12th (Leicester City in 2016–17, having won the title in 2015–16). Liverpool, who had been the English league’s dominant force of the previous two decades with an honours list including 11 league titles between 1973 and 1990, finished a disappointing sixth, and had been in the bottom half of the table as late as March.

In total 1,222 goals were scored, which until the 2023-24 Premier League, stood as a Premier League record, mainly due to significantly larger number of games from 1995–96 season onward. The top scorer in the new Premier League was Teddy Sheringham, who found the net for Nottingham Forest in their opening game of the season before being sold to Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a further 21 goals for the North London side in the league. PFA Player of the Year was Paul McGrath of Aston Villa. FWA Player of the Year was Chris Waddle, who helped Sheffield Wednesday achieve runners-up spot in both of the cups after ending his three-year spell in France. PFA Young Player of the Year was Ryan Giggs, who won the award for the second year running, and also picked up a league title medal with Manchester United.

On 26 January, Wimbledon hosted Everton at Selhurst Park in front of a crowd of just over 3,000. More than 30 years on, this remains the lowest attendance recorded at a Premier League match. Despite their frequently low attendances, Wimbledon managed to climb clear of the relegation battle during the second half of the season to finish 12th.

==Teams==
Twenty-two teams competed in the league – the top nineteen teams from the First Division and the three teams promoted from the Second Division. The promoted teams were Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough and Blackburn Rovers, returning to the top flight after an absence of six, three and twenty-six years respectively. They replaced Luton Town, Notts County and West Ham United, who were relegated to the First Division, ending Luton Town&#x27;s ten-year spell in the top flight, whilst both Notts County and West Ham United were relegated after only one year in the top flight.

Manchester United&#x27;s Paul Ince came second and Blackburn&#x27;s Alan Shearer third. The Young Player of the Year award was given to Ryan Giggs, the 19-year-old Manchester United left winger who had also won the award in the previous season. Giggs, who finished ahead of Tottenham&#x27;s Nick Barmby and Nottingham Forest&#x27;s Roy Keane, became the first player to win the award more than once.

The Football Writers&#x27; Association (the FWA) chose Chris Waddle as its Footballer of the Year. Waddle, who made his return to English football with Sheffield Wednesday after three years in France with Olympique Marseille, became the first Wednesday player to win the award in its 45-year history. McGrath and Giggs finished in second and joint third place respectively in the writers&#x27; poll.

The PFA also selected eleven players to form its Team of the Year. The team included four Manchester United players (Giggs, Ince, Peter Schmeichel and Gary Pallister) and two from Leeds United (Tony Dorigo and Gary Speed). The other members of the team were McGrath, Keane, Shearer, David Bardsley (Queens Park Rangers) and Ian Wright (Arsenal). The Manager of the Year award, chosen by a panel representing football&#x27;s governing body, the media, and fans, was given to Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. The newly formed League Managers Association also presented its own Manager of the Year award for the first time, specifically designed to recognise &quot;the manager who made best use of the resources available to him&quot;. This award went to Dave Bassett of Sheffield United.

<doc id="1145930" wikidata="Q507937" url="?curid=1145930" title="Lucas–Carmichael number">
<text>In mathematics, a Lucas–Carmichael number is a positive composite integer &quot;n&quot; such that
# If &quot;p&quot; is a prime factor of &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; + 1 is a factor of &quot;n&quot; + 1;
# &quot;n&quot; is odd and square-free.
The first condition resembles Korselt&#x27;s criterion for Carmichael numbers, where -1 is replaced with +1. The second condition eliminates from consideration some trivial cases like cubes of prime numbers, such as 8 or 27, which otherwise would be Lucas–Carmichael numbers (since &quot;n&quot;3 + 1 = (&quot;n&quot; + 1)(&quot;n&quot;2 − &quot;n&quot; + 1) is always divisible by &quot;n&quot; + 1).

They are named after Édouard Lucas and Robert Carmichael.

== Properties ==
The smallest Lucas–Carmichael number is 399 = 3 × 7 × 19. It is easy to verify that 3+1, 7+1, and 19+1 are all factors of 399+1 = 400.

The smallest Lucas–Carmichael number with 4 factors is 8855 = 5 × 7 × 11 × 23.

The smallest Lucas–Carmichael number with 5 factors is 588455 = 5 × 7 × 17 × 23 × 43.

It is not known whether any Lucas–Carmichael number is also a Carmichael number.

Thomas Wright proved in 2016 that there are infinitely many Lucas–Carmichael numbers. If we let formula_1 denote the number of Lucas–Carmichael numbers up to formula_2, Wright showed that there exists a positive constant formula_3 such that

formula_4.

<doc id="1145944" wikidata="Q3844075" url="?curid=1145944" title="Jimi Mbaye">
<text>Mamadou &quot;Jimi&quot; Mbaye (2 October 1957 – 12 February 2025) was a Senegalese guitarist best known for his work with Youssou N&#x27;dour. Mbaye developed a unique Senegalese guitar style in which he made his Fender Stratocaster sound like local instruments such as the kora or xalam.

==Background==
Born in Dakar, French Senegal on 2 October 1957, into a family of guewels (griots), Mamadou Mbaye was the grandson of Oumy Seck and Djiby Salif Seck, descendants of Matakou and Massata Seck.

His father, who was very pious, was opposed to his children playing music. When he was ten years old, Mbaye built his first guitar out of fishing line and gasoline cans. At twenty he had scraped up enough money to buy a secondhand Fender Stratocaster. Mbaye was just as determined to get a guitar as he was to make it in the competitive Dakar music scene. Early on he met Youssou N&#x27;Dour and together they became rising stars on Senegal&#x27;s club scene, playing mbalax music. They created the &quot;Super Étoile&quot; band together in 1981 and were musically inseparable ever afterwards.

Jimi Mbaye died on 12 February 2025, at the age of 67.

==Style==
Mbaye was different from other guitarists because of his unique style. Youssou N&#x27;dour said &quot;No one, no one plays guitar like Jimi Mbaye. His playing style is unique&quot;. Mbaye succeeded in transposing the African traditional sounds of khalam (Ngoni) and kora onto his electric Fender Stratocaster. Carlos Santana and Mbaye met during a tour in Los Angeles where Carlos acknowledged that: &quot;Jimi is a very special and incredible guitarist&quot;.

==Albums==
Mbaye released three solo albums, &quot;Dakar Heart&quot;, &quot;Yaye Digalma&quot; and &quot;Khare Dounya&quot;. The last was recorded in Jimi&#x27;s new studio Studio Dogo, in which he produced other artists.

==Later works==
Mbaye recorded six top-selling major-label albums with N&#x27;Dour before taking a leave of absence to record his own solo album, released in 1997, &quot;Dakar Heart&quot;. Recorded at N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s Studio Xippi, &quot;Dakar Heart&quot; features N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s band &quot;Super Étoile&quot;. Mbaye was back at N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s side and very much an integral part of Youssou&#x27;s &quot;Super Étoile&quot; band. In fact, Youssou often traveled abroad with only Mbaye as acoustic guitar accompanist, as he did in June, 1998 for performances in Paris as guests of Brazilian performer Gilberto Gil at the Olympia Theatre.

A member of Youssou N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s Super Étoile Band from 1979 onwards, Mbaye was one of Senegal&#x27;s most influential guitarists. Often compared to Jimi Hendrix and Robert Johnson, Mbaye forged a unique blend of traditional Senegalese roots music and American pop and R&amp;B. Recording a solo album, Dakar Heart, with help from Super Étoile Band musicians in 1997, Mbaye showcased his inventive, kora-derived guitar playing and singing in Wolof, English, and French. Billboard called him &quot;a prodigious world talent&quot;, while Rhythm referred to him as &quot;one of Senegal&#x27;s most exciting musicians&quot;. Music played an ongoing role in Mbaye&#x27;s life. As a youngster, he performed on a self-invented instrument made from discarded garbage cans and nylon fishing line in the streets of Dakar. By the age of 20, he had graduated to a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Mbaye continued to be the backbone of N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s band. In addition to co-writing the 1994 single &quot;Mame Bamba&quot;, he made valuable contributions to six N&#x27;Dour recordings. Mbaye and N&#x27;Dour increasingly performed as a duo. In 1998, they opened the show for Brazilian guitarist Gilberto Gil at the Olympic Theater in Paris.

Mbaye was one of Africa&#x27;s greatest guitarists. He played in Youssou N&#x27;dour&#x27;s Super Étoile from 1979 onwards. He made a solo album, Dakar Heart, on which he sings as well as plays guitar. The album is available from Shanachie Records, catalog #64094. In Europe, it&#x27;s distributed by BMG France.
Dakar Heart skillfully blends Senegalese mbalax with American pop &amp; R&amp;B for a powerful new sound.

==Collaborations==
The third album called &quot;Khare Dounya&quot; was released in 2012. &quot;Khare Dounya&quot; means &quot;Fight for Life&quot;. He recorded this album with his band &quot;Group Dogo&quot;. It&#x27;s an album where Mbaye shows really his musicality. He started to tour with his band around Senegal and the West African region.

Since he had his studio Mbaye often collaborated with many artists from Africa and the rest of the world. We remember the album Daxaar with the late jazz drummer Steve Reid recorded in Mbaye&#x27;s studio Dogo in Dakar.

He was friendly with many musicians. During gigs he would rehearse with other artists to create new songs they could record later to advance their own careers.

He often produced albums for musicians in Senegal. And sometimes he performed with them.

Mbaye quit Super Étoile de Dakar to work on his own solo career and started to tour with his &quot;Group Dogo&quot; all around the world. Mbaye rejoined Super Étoile in 2017. He played in Bercy 2017 together with Habib Faye.

<text>Cloudsplitter is a 1998 historical novel by Russell Banks relating the story of abolitionist John Brown.

The novel is narrated as a retrospective by John Brown&#x27;s son, Owen Brown, from his in the San Gabriel Mountains of California. His reminiscences are triggered by the reception of an invitation from a Miss Mayo, assistant to Oswald Garrison Villard, then researching his book &quot;John Brown: A Biography Fifty Years After&quot; (Boston, 1910).

The title of the book comes from a translation of the Iroquois word Tahawus, the name of the mountain—English name Mount Marcy—just beyond the Brown family estate. It is the highest mountain in New York State.

Until his death on January 7, 2023, Banks had lived for years in Keene, New York, near John Brown&#x27;s Farm in North Elba, New York.

==Plot==
In 1899 Owen Brown, who has spent roughly the past 30 years living in isolation, receives a visit from Miss Mayo, a young woman assisting in the research on a book on his father, John Brown. While Owen initially chases her off he changes his mind and decides to write her a series of letters about his experiences fighting for the abolition of slavery with his father.

Brown recounts his early life growing up under his father&#x27;s guidance, a time which is marked by hardship and loss. Owen loses his mother at an early age. Despite the fact that his father is extremely devout he chooses atheism, much to his father&#x27;s displeasure. At a young age, while defying his father&#x27;s demand that the children reflect on Sunday, Brown falls from the roof of the family home and breaks his arm, wounding himself and developing a permanent disability as a result. When he is a teenager his father loses everything he owns, condemning the family to a life of instability and poverty. A few years later when the youngest child among them, Kitty, is about a year old, she dies from severe burns caused by water spilled by Ruth, Owen&#x27;s teenage sister. When he is 24, shortly before the family moves to North Elba, Owen solicits a prostitute the same evening as his baby sister, Ellen, dies. His father is beside himself and Owen believes that both the death and his father&#x27;s grief are caused by his sin. He repents and becomes fully devoted to his father and his causes.

The family moves to North Elba where John Brown has been given the opportunity to purchase prime farming land for a low price in exchange for helping to acclimate the families of Timbuctoo, mostly free black city folk, to a life of farming. To his shame Owen once again craves a life independent of his father and struggles to feel at home around black people feeling through his acquaintanceship with them a deep guilt over the legacy of slavery. Pressured to stay he begins to help his father with surveying work and additionally developing their homestead as a way station on the Underground Railroad accompanied by two black residents of Timbuctoo: Lyman Epps and Eldon Fleete. While most of the Brown&#x27;s white neighbours are passively anti-slavery their minds change after Brown helps to free Samuel and Susan Cannon, a young couple who allegedly murdered their white owner. Epps and Fleete are eventually arrested on suspicion of having aided the Cannons and John Brown along with Owen and his two elder brothers forcibly rescue them from prison. In the ensuing battle Fleete is shot and killed while two white men, a bounty hunter and a jailer, are injured by the Browns. John Brown later learns the Cannons never made it to Canada. Dejected by this news and Fleete&#x27;s death he decides to take Owen on a business trip to England.

The English trip is disastrous as John Brown is forced to sell his wool at a low price thanks to an unfortunate error. Now that he is further financially ruined Owen urges his father to forget about business to focus on his true life&#x27;s work: ending slavery. Returning home Owen and his father learn that a new law, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 has been passed. The act has the effect of radicalizing John Brown even further. In Springfield, Massachusetts, his former home and the base of his failed business, he preaches at a black church urging parishioners to choose to form a militia to defend themselves and vowing to join them. A small group of around 30 or so take a pledge with the Browns to use violence to protect themselves and the community from slave catchers. However, before the plan can be put to action, John Brown orders Owen to return to North Elba.

Returning to the farm Owen finds himself deeply uncomfortable around both Lyman and Susan Epps. After Susan has a stillbirth, Lyman and she stop working for the Browns and return to Timbuctoo. Owen finds himself obsessing over Susan and stalks the Epps cabin. He first believes he is in love with Susan though later he begins to believe he is actually in love with Lyman. After John Brown returns to the farm Owen and Lyman resume their friendship. After Owen fails to confess his love to Lyman, Lyman dies in a hunting accident that Owen believes he could have prevented, blaming himself for Lyman&#x27;s death.

Shortly after Owen is tasked with his father with retrieving his brother Fred from Springfield and returning to North Elba. While he is there Fred reveals he has violent sexual thoughts regarding women. When Owen dismisses Fred&#x27;s concerns Fred castrates himself. Owen then decides to defy his father and takes Fred to Kansas where his two older brothers, John Jr. and Jason, have settled for cheap land and to defend the abolitionist cause.

In Kansas Owen is dispirited to realize that while the pro-slavery forces are little more than a ragtag mob the abolitionist forces constantly seek to defer to them to avoid violence. Owen is eventually joined by his father and several of his brothers. Together they seek to violently defend their abolitionist neighbours and are surprised when they are repeatedly undercut by the politicians who only seek to appease. Owen finally urges his father towards violence and he, along with his brothers, murder 5 pro-slavery settlers in what is to be known as the Pottawatomie massacre. While Owen&#x27;s older brothers are disturbed by the murders and decide to leave their father, John Brown forms a small militia of men who conduct small raids and is joined by a revolving group of white men who hold anti-slavery sentiments but who for the most part are disturbed by the killing. A few years later in Osawatomie while outnumbered by pro-slavery forces Brown nevertheless manages to capture the entire militia.

John Brown eventually becomes convinced he needs to raid Harpers Ferry where a large store of munitions is held believing that once word of his capture of the place becomes known he will be joined by white men who wish to abolish slavery and large contingents of slaves will be inspired to rebel and join him. Before the raid he has a private meeting with his friend and ally Frederick Douglass who does not endorse his plan and fears it will fail as he does not believe white men will risk their lives to free black people. John Brown goes forward with his plan anyway believing that Douglass will join him. He urges Owen to destroy his papers and then wait to meet up with any fleeing slaves. Owen does not burn his papers and instead watches as the raid fails as no one comes to join Brown and his militia and they are instead overwhelmed by a pro-slavery mob.

Brown reveals that he felt free after his father&#x27;s capture but further reveals to Miss Mayo that he intends to commit suicide after finally finishing his account of his life with his father.

==Major themes==

Banks raises a number of thematic questions during the lengthy portrayal of his subject matter. Notable among them are:
*How emotional attachment and hermetic exile provide for an unreliable narration.
*The moral consequences of radicalism: violent vs. non-violent protest.
*The fine line between sanity and religious fanaticism: &quot;the Lord speaks to me.&quot;
*How strong familial attachment is itself a form of slavery.
*Loss of innocence.
*Your actions affect those around you (John Brown with his family and friends).

The narrative style employed by Banks is introspective and apologetic where each character&#x27;s moral compass is seen as through the microscope of Owen Brown&#x27;s telling; detailed and larger than life. Bank&#x27;s prose uses language that registers on the psyche: evoking the conviction that redemption can be gained by an Augustinian confession. And yet the reader is goaded into sympathy with these characters by their sheer persistence in the face of seemingly insurmountable daily travails - evoking the innocence of a new-born country.

==Literary license==

Banks takes great license with some of the historical figures in his narrative and very clearly states in his preface that his book is a work of fiction and not to be substituted for a work of biography or history. 

Notable departures between historical fact and the fictionalized events in the books include:

*Owen Brown being alive in 1909 (50 years later) when the real Owen Brown died in 1889.
* Owen accompanying his father on his trip to England.
* Kitty is an invention.
* The timeline of the Browns move to North Elba.
* Owen&#x27;s interest in Lyman&#x27;s wife and in the pregnant young woman who kills herself jumping into the ocean during the trip to England.
* The time Lyman Epps and his wife spent with the Browns. Much of Lyman Epps Sr.&#x27;s life was heavily fictionalized, including his age, the name of his wife, and the time and cause of his death.
* In the novel, &quot;Dutch&quot; Henry Sherman, a stated target in the Pottawatomie spree, is killed. In reality he happened to be absent on the morning of the killings and thus survived. His brother William, however, was present and consequently murdered.

==Reception==
The novel was reviewed positively in a number of places: 

* &quot;Russell Banks has created in &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot; an immediate landmark in American fiction&quot;
* &quot;Masterly ... a furious, sprawling drama that commands attention like thunder heard from just over the horizon.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; (quoted in:)
* &quot;... a novel of near-biblical proportions about the abolitionist freedom fighter John Brown, is shaped like an explosive with an exceedingly long and winding fuse.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; Tom Cox selected &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot; as one of his &quot;overlooked classics of American literature&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
*PEN/Faulkner finalist
*Pulitzer Prize finalist

==Adaptations==
In 2002, it was reported that Martin Scorsese was to produce a film adaptation of &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot;, to be directed by Raoul Peck, for the film production company HBO.

<text>In computational complexity theory, NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space) is the complexity class containing decision problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine using a logarithmic amount of memory space.

NL is a generalization of [[L (complexity)|L]], the class for logspace problems on a deterministic Turing machine. Since any deterministic Turing machine is also a nondeterministic Turing machine, we have that L is contained in NL.

NL can be formally defined in terms of the computational resource nondeterministic space (or NSPACE) as NL = NSPACE(log &quot;n&quot;).

Important results in complexity theory allow us to relate this complexity class with other classes, telling us about the relative power of the resources involved. Results in the field of algorithms, on the other hand, tell us which problems can be solved with this resource. Like much of complexity theory, many important questions about NL are still open (see Unsolved problems in computer science).

Occasionally NL is referred to as RL due to its probabilistic definition below; however, this name is more frequently used to refer to randomized logarithmic space, which is not known to equal NL.

==NL-complete problems==
Several problems are known to be NL-complete under log-space reductions, including ST-connectivity and 2-satisfiability. ST-connectivity asks, for nodes &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; in a directed graph, whether &quot;T&quot; is reachable from &quot;S&quot;. 2-satisfiability asks, given a propositional formula of which each clause is the disjunction of two literals, if there is a variable assignment that makes the formula true. An example instance, where formula_1 indicates &quot;not&quot;, might be:

:formula_2

==Containments==
It is known that is contained in , since there is a polynomial-time algorithm for 2-satisfiability, but it is not known whether or whether . It is known that , where is the class of languages whose complements are in . This result (the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem) was independently discovered by Neil Immerman and Róbert Szelepcsényi in 1987; they received the 1995 Gödel Prize for this work.

In circuit complexity, can be placed within the hierarchy. In Papadimitriou 1994, Theorem 16.1, we have:

:formula_3.

More precisely, is contained in . It is known that is equal to , the class of problems solvable by randomized algorithms in logarithmic space and unbounded time, with no error. It is not, however, known or believed to be equal to or , the polynomial-time restrictions of and , which some authors refer to as and .

We can relate to deterministic space using Savitch&#x27;s theorem, which tells us that any nondeterministic algorithm can be simulated by a deterministic machine in at most quadratically more space. From Savitch&#x27;s theorem, we have directly that:

:formula_4

This was the strongest deterministic-space inclusion known in 1994 (Papadimitriou 1994 Problem 16.4.10, &quot;Symmetric space&quot;). Since larger space classes are not affected by quadratic increases, the nondeterministic and deterministic classes are known to be equal, so that for example we have .

==Alternative definitions==
===Probabilistic definition===
Suppose &quot;C&quot; is the complexity class of decision problems solvable in logarithmithic space with probabilistic Turing machines that never accept incorrectly but are allowed to reject incorrectly less than 1/3 of the time; this is called &quot;one-sided error&quot;. The constant 1/3 is arbitrary; any &quot;x&quot; with 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; 1/2 would suffice.

It turns out that &quot;C&quot; = NL. Notice that &quot;C&quot;, unlike its deterministic counterpart L, is not limited to polynomial time, because although it has a polynomial number of configurations it can use randomness to escape an infinite loop. If we do limit it to polynomial time, we get the class RL, which is contained in but not known or believed to equal NL.

There is a simple algorithm that establishes that &quot;C&quot; = NL. Clearly &quot;C&quot; is contained in NL, since:
* If the string is not in the language, both reject along all computation paths.
* If the string is in the language, an NL algorithm accepts along at least one computation path and a &quot;C&quot; algorithm accepts along at least two-thirds of its computation paths.
To show that NL is contained in &quot;C&quot;, we simply take an NL algorithm and choose a random computation path of length &quot;n&quot;, and execute this 2&quot;n&quot; times. Because no computation path exceeds length &quot;n&quot;, and because there are 2&quot;n&quot; computation paths in all, we have a good chance of hitting the accepting one (bounded below by a constant).

The only problem is that we don&#x27;t have room in log space for a binary counter that goes up to 2&quot;n&quot;. To get around this we replace it with a &quot;randomized&quot; counter, which simply flips &quot;n&quot; coins and stops and rejects if they all land on heads. Since this event has probability 2−&quot;n&quot;, we expect to take 2&quot;n&quot; steps on average before stopping. It only needs to keep a running total of the number of heads in a row it sees, which it can count in log space.

Because of the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, according to which NL is closed under complements, the one-sided error in these probabilistic computations can be replaced by zero-sided error. That is, these problems can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines that use logarithmic space and never make errors. The corresponding complexity class that also requires the machine to use only polynomial time is called ZPLP.

Thus, when we only look at space, it seems that randomization and nondeterminism are equally powerful.

===Certificate definition===
NL can equivalently be characterised by certificates, analogous to classes such as NP. Consider a deterministic logarithmic-space bounded Turing machine that has an additional read-only read-once input tape. A language is in NL if and only if such a Turing machine accepts any word in the language for an appropriate choice of certificate in its additional input tape, and rejects any word not in the language regardless of the certificate.

Cem Say and Abuzer Yakaryılmaz have proven that the deterministic logarithmic-space Turing machine in the statement above can be replaced by a bounded-error probabilistic constant-space Turing machine that is allowed to use only a constant number of random bits.

==Descriptive complexity==
There is a simple logical characterization of NL: it contains precisely those languages expressible in first-order logic with an added transitive closure operator.

== Closure properties ==
The class NL is closed under the operations complementation, union, and therefore intersection, concatenation, and Kleene star.

<doc id="1145960" wikidata="Q541434" url="?curid=1145960" title="Vehicle registration plates of Italy">
<text>The Italian vehicle registration plates ( or, simply, ) are the compulsory alphanumeric plates used to display the &quot;registration mark&quot; of motor vehicles registered in Italy. They have existed in the country since 1897.

By law, Italian plates can only be made by the Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato, assigned by the territorial offices of the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and permanently attached to a single vehicle from its first registration to its disposal. 

The current alphanumeric serial code was introduced on 28 February 1994 and consists of seven black characters on a rectangular, or squared, white background with a defined format (2 letters, 3 numbers, and then 2 letters) which is issued nationwide, regardless of the local registration office. Starting from 7 February 1999, this format was slightly redesigned adding a blue strip on the left containing the EU flag above the country code codice_1 in order to comply with the common EU format, removing the previous space between the last number and the third letter, and adding a further blue strip on the right for optional stickers of the first registration year and of the provincial code.

*The plates with format between EE 000AA and EE 999ZZ have not been released to avoid confusion with Escursionisti Esteri plates.

===Squared plates===
== History ==

=== 1897–1901 ===
In 1897 with the Royal Decree of 16 December 1897, n. 540 the very first Italian plates were provided for velocipedes and issued by the municipality of residence.

By analogy, in 1898, the municipality of Milan promulgated the &quot;Regulation for the circulation of motor vehicles (article 17)&quot; according to which a plate showing owner&#x27;s name and the municipal license number, had to be displayed on the left side of any motor vehicle.

=== 1901–1905 ===

With the Royal Decree of 28 August 1901, n. 416 the first &quot;Regulation for the circulation of cars on ordinary roads (article 91)&quot; was promulgated. This new law included the obligation to equip all vehicles with a specific fixed license plate, that had to be created by the owner and had to be made of metal showing, in full and clearly visible characters, the name of the province followed by a license number issued by the local prefecture.

Schematic representation
=== 1905–1927 ===

Plates in this period were black-on-white. The registration number was a numeric code (in red), different for each province, and a progressive number on a single line, unique for that province (in black). E.g. – 2993, where 63 is the code for Turin.

The standard shape was rectangular, whereas motorcycles had square plates. A front plate was optional.

As in the previous version, the number was assigned by the local prefecture and the plate had to be made by the owner.

Schematic representation
=== 1927–1976 ===

In 1927, during the Fascist regime, the Kingdom of Italy changed the number plates from a white background with black (and red) digits, to a black metallic background with white digits and introduced a new two-letter provincial code for all provinces (except for Rome that, since then, has been allowed to keep the full name on registration plates, and the unofficial code RM in documents for practical purposes).
From 1927 to 1932, the progressive numeric code was placed before the provincial code, on a single line, for both front and rear plates.

From 1932 to 1951, the front plate remained unchanged, but the rear plate became a 320 x 200 mm square, with a slightly altered Garamond font, and the provincial code was moved to the top left corner. From 1928 to 1944 the Fasces emblem was placed next to the provincial code. After the fall of the Fascist regime, from 1944 to 1948, the registration plates were printed by the &quot;National Association of the Amputees and War Invalids&quot;, the symbol of which replaced the Fasces emblem. 
In 1948 the Constitution of the Italian Republic was approved, so the Italian Republic emblem appeared for the first time on registration plates on both rear and front sides, but the format and font continued to be the same.

From 1951 to 1976, the rear square plate was reduced to 275 × 200 mm, while a single line rear registration plate (similar to the ones used by other European countries) was not still available. The front plate was reduced to 262 × 57 mm and it was also changed in order to get more linear characters and a smaller Italian Republic emblem.
Starting from 1963, the material of the plates switched from metal to plastic.
The scheme was the same introduced in 1927, which was a two-letter provincial code and a progressive numeric code, that was unique for that province and up to 6 characters long. On the rear plate, the Italian Republic emblem (a garland surrounding a five-pointed star with the letters &quot;RI&quot; in the middle of the star) was placed between the provincial code and the first two digits.

The code for the first 999,999 vehicles of any province was just a progressive number, not filled with initial zeroes; therefore, in the rear plate the last four digits were placed in the second row and the first ones in the first row, only if they were present.
From 1,000,000 onwards, it was A00000–A99999, then B00000–B99999, and so on. Possible letters were, in this order, A B D E F G H K L M N P R S T U V Z X Y W. After that, it was 00000A–99999A, 00000D–99999D, and so on. Possible letters were, in this order, A D E F G H L M N P R S T V W X Y Z. Then, the letter was moved to the second position, and then to the third (same range as in the second position).

=== 1976–1985 ===
The front plate was kept intact as in the 1927-1976 period. The rear plate, instead, began to be manufactured in two pieces. 
One, sized 10,7 × 33 cm, had black background with white digits, contained the progressive number and, in a very small font, the repetition of provincial code above and the Republic emblem. 
The other had black background with orange letters and contained the official provincial code and had two variants. One was 10,7 × 33 cm large, the other one was 10,7 × 20 cm large. Only one of the latter two was used depending on the type of plate holder that the plate was destined for: for a rectangular plate holder, the small provincial code piece was installed left of the progressive code, put together with rivets in specifically designed holes in the progressive code
For cars that were designed with the previous number plate holder (Square), or too small for a rectangular plate, the long provincial code piece was installed above the progressive code.
This change resolved the plate positioning problem on cars of foreign production, eventually the rectangular European system was preferred over the squared plate holder of Italian designed cars.

Schematic representations
=== 1985–1994 ===
In 1985, plates began to use black digits on white reflective background. Rear plates remained identical as in the 1976-1985 period. Front plates became larger (32.5 × 10.7 cm) but remained slightly smaller than rear plates.
The progressive code was moved after the provincial code, as it was already for rear plates.

The reflective background had an official code that appears on the background in small letters, PGS B1 or PGS A1.

(PGS means &quot;Provveditorato Generale dello Stato&quot; and A or B is the city where the reflective was made and 1-2 means white or yellow reflective)

This new system made so that provinces with less than 6 digits had to have a 0 in place of the missing digits (LC 004239).

The highest combination reached with the 1927 system was MI 01D000 for the province of Milan in 28/02/1994, the same day plates using the new system started to be issued.

In 1994, the provinces that were instituted in 1992 (Lecco, Verbania, Vibo-Valentia, Lodi) were allowed to choose to issue either the old 1927 system plates (PP NNNNNN) or the 1994 standard (LL NNN LL), up to 12.000 plates until 1999.

=== 1994–present ===

From 28 February 1994, an entirely new numeration system was introduced which omitted any explicit reference to the place of origin. A simple alpha-numeric serial code takes the form AA 999 AA. Here ‘A’ can be any letter of the Latin alphabet except I, O, Q, U and is treated as a base-22 digit; 9 can be any decimal digit. e.g. AK 514 RH, AX 848 LK, BA 924 NS, etc. The three-digit number changes first, then the letters from right to left. So, first plate is AA 000 AA, followed by AA 001 AA...AA 999 AA, then AA 000 AB to AA 999 AZ, then AA 000 BA to AA 999 ZZ, then AB 000 AA to AZ 999 ZZ, then BA 000 AA to ZZ 999 ZZ.

Rear plates are no more in two pieces. Instead, a square plate can be chosen instead of the ordinary long one for vehicles with a squared plate holder. If the rear plate is square, the numbering scheme starts from ZA 000 AA, and is followed by ZA 001 AA...ZA 999 AA, then ZA 000 AB to ZA 999 AZ, then ZA 000 BA to ZA 999 ZZ, then ZB 000 AA to ZZ 999 ZZ.

 In 1999, the plates were redesigned, starting from the serial number BB 000HH. The digits are thicker. The last decimal digit is now very close to the third letter. The standard European blue band has been added on the left side, with the European flag motif (12 yellow stars) and the country code I. Another blue band was added, on the right side, bearing a yellow circle with the year of registration (optional).

The two-letter provincial code is optionally present on the right band in capital letters. For the capital city of Rome, the word Roma replaces the two-digit provincial code. 
Provincial codes are in capital letters except for three cases, where the second letter is expressed in small caps for the provincial codes of the autonomous provinces of Bolzano (Bz) and Trento (Tn) and the autonomous region Aosta Valley (Ao), that are surmounted by the local coat of arms.

The reintroduction of the provincial code (although no longer as a compulsory element of the plate) was implemented because the 1994 suppression of the two-letter provincial codes proved extremely unpopular. Unlike before, the provincial code is not part of the registration number, which is the same for the whole nation. Despite an initial period of popularity, the right band remains empty in most cases.

Since 2003, the PGS B1 or PGS A1 code has been replaced by the code MEF B1 or MEF A1.

===Motorcycle plates===

====1994 standard====

Motorcycles from 1999 have plates with two letters and five digits, starting from AA 00000. For these vehicles, the province codes are not used to avoid confusion (i.e. the plate after AF 99999 is AH 00000, because AG is the old provincial code for Agrigento). Plate size is .

Like cars, motorcycles have blue two lateral bands, on the left is the EU band with the circle of 12 stars and Italy&#x27;s international code (I) . On the right, the blue band has a yellow circle with the year of matriculation (00=2000) and underneath, the optional provincial code sticker (Roma= Rome).

From 1994 to 1999, motorcycles did not have the blue bands, and the first digit was on the right of the first two letters.

Due to the large quantity of old provincial system plates, the 1994 system motorcycles plates started to be distributed from 1996.
1994–1999 motorcycle standard
==== Former provincial code system (1927–1994) ====

From 1927 until 1994, motorcycles used to have, like cars, the Provincial Code instead of the two letters on two lines, followed by a maximum of 6 digits

From 1927 to 1932, Motorcycles used to have white digits on a black background and the provincial code was after the digits on the second line, in 1932 (to 1985) the motorcycle plates changed to a white background with blue digits, the provincial code was moved before the digits and like cars, Motorcycles used the Garamond font until 1951.

In 1951, motorcycles, unlike cars, had a font transition that was completed in 1963, when plates started to be made of plastic but keeping the old format.

From 1985 to 1994, motorcycles changed to a white reflective background and black digits and returned to be made of metal

===Moped plates===
Registration plates of small mopeds were introduced in 1994; before that date Italian mopeds had no plate at all. They were trapezoid-shaped and had a registration system based on a five letter-and-digit combination (treated as a 31-base numeric system), with the first two placed on top and the following three below (such as 47 A23 or K3 561 or 8X 4RF, whereby whole sets of series were assigned locally). In 2006 new moped plates were introduced; new plates have a rectangular shape measuring 12 by 14 cm. The registration shows six characters: the first is always &quot;X&quot; (&quot;Y&quot; for Local Police plates), the other five follows the same scheme as the old system; however the digit 1 and 0 and the letters A, E, I, O, Q and U are not used. Since 2012 old moped plates are no longer valid and have to be replaced by new ones.

The reason for the change was that with the old moped system, the plate could be transferred to another moped and was bound to the owner rather than the vehicle, whereas the new plates are bound to the vehicle.

===Trailer plates===

Car and truck trailers had two plates: the trailer&#x27;s own one was quite small and bore the word &quot;RIMORCHIO&quot; (trailer) and a two letters-five digit code, the other had the same size of vehicles&#x27; rear plates and bore the same registration of the prime mover with black decal-characters on a retroflective yellow base. From February 2013 new trailer plates were introduced: they use the same pattern of standard vehicle plates, the numeric scheme is XL 000 LL where &quot;L&quot; is a generic letter, &quot;0&quot; is a digit and &quot;X&quot; is the reserved letter. Mover repetition plates are no longer needed on trailers registered with new plates, however they are still compulsory for old trailers with small plates and small unregistered &quot;appendix trailers&quot;.

From 1932 to 1959 trailer plates were the same as car plates (white digits on a black background), only with the word &quot;RIMORCHIO&quot; under the numbers, written in italic.

After 1959 to 1985, the trailer plates were like the front vehicles number plates (black background with white digits), with the digits before the provincial code, with the word &quot;RIMORCHIO&quot; above the digits followed by the provincial code.

From 1985 until 1994 the trailer plates were enlarged, had black digits on a white reflective background with the provincial code before the digits and the word &quot;RIMORCHIO&quot; assumed red coloration. Until 1993 they had to be displayed on the right of the trailer.

===Police plates===
Local police forces have the word &quot;POLIZIA LOCALE&quot; (local police) in blue. They have the same pattern as trailer and civilian plates, the scheme is YL 000 LL where &quot;L&quot; is a letter, &quot;0&quot; is a digit and the &quot;Y&quot; is the reserved letter (for motorcycles YL 00000, mopeds Y00 000). Unlike civilian plates they do not show up the code. National police plates have &quot;POLIZIA&quot; in red followed by letter, then numbers (formerly numbers only until 1983). Customs police plates start with prefix &quot;GF&quot; in red. The serial letters and three serial numbers are in black.

===Diplomatic plates===

From 1932 to 1951, the diplomatic plates are square 32.0 x 22.0 cm, white digits on a black background using the Garamond font with the &quot;CD&quot; prefix instead of the province followed by a max of 5 digits, the first two digits was the country&#x27;s code.

From 1951 to 1976, the diplomatic plates are square 27.5 x 20.0 cm, white digits on black background, changed to a more linear font, but the system was identical from the previous period.

ex: CD 22843

From 1976 to 1985 the diplomatic plates are on a single line, black background with white digits, with the letters &quot;CD&quot; vertically aligned, followed by 5 digits, the first two represented the country, the other three a progressive number.

In 1985 to 1995 the diplomatic plates have white reflective background with black digits, with blue letters and change to a CD 000 AA system, with the letters representing the country. 
The Italian Republic emblem appears on top of the first two letters of the plate and on the top right the international white oval with a black letter representing Italy&#x27;s international code (I)
Diplomatic plates have blue letters since 1985 and have 4 numbers to avoid confusion with the new civilian plates issued since 1994. These have the &quot;CC&quot; (Corpo Consolare), &quot;CD&quot; (Corpo Diplomatico) and four numbers, while &quot;UN&quot; (Nazioni Unite (Permanent)), &quot;UNP&quot; (Nazioni Unite (Specialists)), and &quot;UNT&quot; (Nazioni Unite (Transit)) plates have three. Scheme is CC 0000 AA or UNP 000 AA. The &quot;AA&quot; is a country code (blue) while &quot;0&quot; is a digit. Front and rear plates are identical and both measure 34 by 11 cm.

There are no diplomatic motorcycle plates used.

===Military plates===
Military plates have the prefixes EI (Esercito Italiano, Army), AM (Aeronautica Militare, Air Force) and MM (Marina Militare, Navy), all of them red, the trailers have the indication &quot;RIMORCHIO&quot;. There is a code same as mentioned before, but it is small and it is black. The scheme is EI LL 000. While &quot;EI&quot; is the prefix, &quot;LL&quot; is a letter and &quot;0&quot; is a digit to prevent confusion with civilian plates issued from 1994. Between the letter and number there is a green dot. In 1980 Army plates adopted the 11 by 34 cm size for both front and rear plates, but more recent plates use the 1994-99 civilian plate standard for rear plates. Starting from 2004, historical military vehicles that no longer possess the original plate use instead the scheme EI VS 000, &quot;VS&quot; (Veicolo Storico) is colored green. Until 1995 army plates used an EI 000 AA system and before 1985 used an EI 000000 system with the same dimension of civilian plates (smaller front plate) where certain number ranges were reserved for types of vehicles EX: EI 900000 to EI 999999 were reserved to trailers and EI 400000 to 450000 were reserved for recon vehicles.
However, the pre-1979 numbers only system is still used for armored vehicles and tanks.

=== Red Cross plates ===

Have the prefix &quot;CRI&quot; (Croce Rossa Italiana) in red, the style is CRI 000LL (pre-2007 was CRI L000L, motorcycles CRI 00000), while &quot;L&quot; is a letter, and &quot;0&quot; is a number on a white reflective background. Between &quot;CRI&quot; and the other characters there is the Red Cross sign. They use the same style of pre-1999 plates; the final code of two-line plates always starts with the letter &quot;Z&quot;.

Trailer plates have the word &quot;RIMORCHIO&quot; above the digits using a CRI 0000 system.

Before 1985 Red Cross plates had a dot after every number and had the same format of civilian plates (smaller front plate)

Until 1985 Red Cross plates were numbers only, after late Seventies ambulances had to have the L000L format, while service cars continued to have numbers only until 2002 where all new Red Cross vehicles had to have the L000L system.

===Firefighters===
Before 1938, firefighters vehicles used civilian plates

Since 1938 have the prefix &quot;VF&quot; (Vigili del Fuoco) in red . They have the same style and dimension of Port Authority plates, but they do not have text in the bottom section. Firefighters of autonomous regions use special Firefighters plates issued locally. Their schemes were VF 0L0 AA (formerly VF L00 AA), where &quot;AA&quot; at the end can be TN or BZ. Trailers have small red &quot;R&quot; between prefix and numbers.

===Port Authority plates===
Have the prefix &quot;CP&quot; (Capitaneria di Porto) in red. They have the text &quot;GUARDIA COSTIERA&quot; at the bottom. Those plates are considerably shorter than a standard one (circa 35 by 52mm), front and rear plates have the same size and square rear plates are not available.

Schematic representation
===SMOM plates===

Uses prefix &quot;SMOM&quot; (Sovrano militare ordine di Malta) in red, followed by two numbers (previously red). They have the text &quot;SMOM&quot; at the bottom. These plates used only by Sovereign Military Order of Malta members (only plate that was circulating on along with its diplomatic plate (code XA), being SMOM is a subject of international law.), and these plates were issued by Ministry of Defence.

Schematic representation
===Temporary plates===
These plates are used for vehicles temporarily circulating in Italy, but have to be exported, &quot;EE&quot; stands for &quot;Escursionisti Esteri&quot; (Foreign Hikers or temporary plates).

They have the same style of Diplomatic plates, but they start with &quot;EE&quot; (black) instead of &quot;CD&quot;. The upper part of the plate has a small space for accommodating expiry date stickers.

From 1932 to 1951, they are square 32.0 x 22.0 cm, white digits on a black background with Garamond font, using an EE 00000 system.

From 1951 to 1976, they are square 27.5 x 20.0 cm, white digits on a black background with different font style and have the EE prefix instead of the province followed by a max of 5 digits ex: EE 10245

From 1976 to 1985, they are on a single line, white digits on a black background and the letters EE are vertically aligned, followed by a max of 5 digits.

From 1985, they are on a single line, black digits on white reflective background with the EE 000 AA system.

Motorcycles had the &quot;EE&quot; on the first line then 4 digits on the second line, white background with blue digits from 1932 to 1985 and have the sticker space above the republic emblem. From 1985 motorcycles have the prefix followed by a letter and a progressive number.

===Road machinery plates===

The style of these plates is LL LNNN. They are square, red on yellow background. They were introduced in 1992, until 1994 they used a LL LLNNN System, where the first two letters were the provincial code. Due to the low road machinery plates assigned, provinces had been distributing the old system plates over the course of many years before the new ones appeared.

===Civil Defence plates===
These plates only exist in autonomous regions, they have the prefix &quot;PC&quot; (Protezione Civile) in red and an alphanumeric serial chosen by local authorities (PC ZS0LL in Bolzano (where ZS stands for Zivilschutz in German), PC L00TN in Trento).
Cars of the national Civil Defence department have special plates bearing the &quot;DPC&quot; (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile) code followed by an alphanumeric serial (DPC L 0000) in Rome, while operative vehicles usually use civil plates. Emergency plates have the text at the top:&quot;DIPARTIMENTO PROTEZIONE CIVILE RICOVERO DI EMERGENZA&quot;, then a provincial designator and four numbers.

===Carabinieri plates===

These plates have the prefix &quot;CC&quot; (Corpo di Carabinieri) in red from 2000 when the Carabinieri became an independent corp. The style is CC LL 000 where &quot;CC&quot; is a prefix, &quot;L&quot; is a letter, and &quot;0&quot; is a digit. Motorcycles use a CC A0000 system.

Until 2000 &quot;CC&quot; plates did not exist and used the Army (EI) plates and the first CC plates (which were re-adapted EI plates) had a CC separate piece put over the first part to cover up the &quot;EI&quot; code

===Trolleybus plates===
These plates&#x27; format is the two-letter provincial code, followed by the operator&#x27;s logo and number (normally 3 digits). They use white digits on a blue background, and their size is 320 x 115 mm. Until the 1950s they were circulated along with normal car plates.

===Test Plates===
Testing plates have a square (16.5 by 16.5 cm) size and follows the format XX p X/XXXX (where &quot;X&quot; could be a letter or a digit ) arranged in two lines since 2003. They are the only kind of Italian plates whose code could be chosen by the owner.

These plates have a &quot;P&quot; instead of the republic emblem that means Prova (Test)

These plates are usually used from car dealers to test the cars on the public road, for cars that do not have an insurance or do not have a regular number plate available. They can be transferred on other cars

From 1951 to 1976, testing plates used to be square, black background with white digits, in middle the word &quot;PROVA&quot; was written in red, followed by the provincial code, the official emblem and a progressive number.

From 1976 to 1985, these plates used to have black background with white digits on a single line, with the provincial code followed by a progressive number and the word &quot;PROVA&quot; vertically aligned by 90° degrees.

Until 1994, Test plates used to have the provincial code instead of the first two digits, followed by a random combination of letters and numbers. From 1994 to 2003, the plates used to be on a single line with two letters followed by the random digits.

== Province codes ==

===Province codes 1927 to present day===
These abbreviations for the names of provinces are extensively used in contexts other than vehicle registration. For example, &quot;Trino (VC)&quot;, to indicate a place called Trino in the province of Vercelli, could appear on letterheaded paper or in a postal address or in a guide book and very often on business cards and trade signs. The abbreviations even count as valid words in crosswords and in &quot;Scarabeo&quot;, the Italian version of the board game Scrabble. Sometimes, the code RM is used instead of Roma for the province of Rome, in postal addresses or documents.

===Province codes 1905 to 1927===
=== Defunct province codes (post-1927) ===
== Diplomatic codes ==
&#x27; codes are not currently used. Q and V cannot be used in consular corps plates, as such they are Bold Italic&quot;&quot;&#x27;.

<doc id="1145963" wikidata="Q930904" url="?curid=1145963" title="Huff (TV series)">
<text>Huff (stylized as &quot; HUFF!&quot;) is an American drama television series that aired on Showtime from November 7, 2004, to June 25, 2006. It won three Primetime Emmy Awards from ten nominations, as well as being nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

The storyline is centered around psychiatrist Craig Huffstodt. He is a good therapist and middle-aged family man in the middle of a mid-life crisis. His own family&#x27;s private lives are chaotic, including a mentally incurable brother Teddy, who fascinates Craig&#x27;s adolescent son, Byrd.

==Cast and characters==
Besides Azaria, the cast included Paget Brewster, Blythe Danner (who won the Emmy Award in 2005 and 2006 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Izzy), Oliver Platt, Anton Yelchin, Andy Comeau, Kimberly Brooks, Liza Lapira, and Faith Prince.

Those making recurring guest appearances on the show during its first season included Lara Flynn Boyle, Robert Forster, Swoosie Kurtz, Annie Potts, and Faith Prince. In its second season, &quot;Huff&quot; also managed to attract high-profile recurring guest stars, including Sharon Stone and Anjelica Huston.

===Main===
* Hank Azaria as Dr. Craig &quot;Huff&quot; Huffstodt: a Los Angeles psychiatrist whose life is sent reeling when a tragedy occurs in his office. An eternal caretaker who thinks he can save people, Huff learns very brutally that he can&#x27;t save everyone. He deals with the functionally insane all day, and when he comes home, he&#x27;s faced with the daily insanities of family life.
* Paget Brewster as Beth Huffstodt: Huff&#x27;s loving yet capricious wife. She helps Huff avoid meltdowns while providing welcome, wifely support and amenities.
* Oliver Platt as Russell Tupper: Huff&#x27;s lawyer, longtime friend, and former running buddy from their single days. Although a source of questionable ethics and morality, he still gets it done with a sense of humor and comes through for Huff.
* Blythe Danner as Isabelle &quot;Izzy&quot; Huffstodt: Huff&#x27;s mother, who has lived in the apartment above the garage since the breakup of her marriage. Izzy is tough and manipulative but also funny and irreverent.
* Anton Yelchin as Byrd Huffstodt: Huff and Beth&#x27;s 14-year-old son. He is a loving child who is concerned with his father&#x27;s well-being and about what&#x27;s going on in the family. He&#x27;s a very bright teenager.
* Andy Comeau as Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Huffstodt: Huff&#x27;s younger brother. Literally and figuratively locked away in a private mental institution, Teddy&#x27;s mental illness brings clarity of thought to Huff during his visits.
* Kimberly Brooks as Paula Dellahouse: Huff&#x27;s office manager who protects him as much as she provokes him. She has been with Huff for a long time and knows him and his family very well.
* Liza Lapira as Maggie Del Rosario: Russell&#x27;s utterly devoted yet pull-no-punches assistant. She cares for him, covers for him and curses him, but it&#x27;s all in a day&#x27;s work for her as she knows she&#x27;s probably the only woman Russell has ever allowed himself to truly depend on.
* Faith Prince as Kelly Knippers: a television sales rep whom Russell meets and woos while shopping for a flat screen. A wild night of partying and debauchery results in a pregnancy that changes both their lives.

The series was created by Bob Lowry and features Hank Azaria as Dr. Craig &quot;Huff&quot; Huffstodt, a psychiatrist whose life changes abruptly when a 15-year-old client commits suicide in his office. The series follows Huff, his family, and his friend Russell Tupper, played by Oliver Platt, as they navigate life.

The first season was broadcast on Showtime between November 7, 2004, and January 30, 2005. The second season premiered on April 2, 2006, and ended on June 25, 2006. Two days before the finale, Showtime announced that the show would not be picked up for a third season, and several plotlines, including the resolution of pending criminal charges against Russell Tupper and the possibility of reconciliation between Huff and Beth, were left unresolved.

The two-hour pilot episode was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Later, production for &quot;Huff&quot; was moved to Delfino Stages in Los Angeles, California.

<text>CIMOSA, standing for &quot;Computer Integrated Manufacturing Open System Architecture&quot;, is an enterprise modeling framework, which aims to support the enterprise integration of machines, computers and people. The framework is based on the system life cycle concept, and offers a modelling language, methodology and supporting technology to support these goals.

It was developed in the 1990s by the AMICE Consortium, in an EU project. A non-profit organization CIMOSA Association was later established to keep ownership of the CIMOSA specification, to promote it and to support its further evolution.

The original aim of CIMOSA (1992) was &quot;to elaborate an open system architecture for CIM and to define a set of concepts and rules to facilitate the building of future CIM systems&quot;. One of the main ideas of CIMOSA is the categorization of manufacturing operations in:
* Generic functions: generic parts of every enterprise, independent of organisation structure or business area.
* Specific (partial and particular) functions: specific for individual enterprises.

The development of CIMOSA has ultimately resulted in two key items: 
* &quot;Modeling Framework&quot;: This framework supports &quot;all phases of the CIM system life-cycle from requirements definition, through design specification, implementation description and execution of the daily enterprise operation&quot;.
* &quot;Integrating Infrastructure&quot;: This infrastructure provides &quot;specific information technology services for the execution of the Particular Implementation Model&quot;, which has proven to be vendor independent and portable.
The framework furthermore offers an &quot;event-driven, process-based modeling approach with the goal to cover essential enterprise aspects in one integrated model. The main aspects are the functional, behavioral, resource, information and organizational aspect&quot;.

CIMOSA can be applied in process simulation and analysis. Standardized CIMOSA models &quot;can also be used on line in the manufacturing enterprise for scheduling, dispatching, monitoring and providing process information&quot;. One of the standards based on CIMOSA is the Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM).

==Building blocks==
The main focus of CIMOSA has been to construct:
* a framework for enterprise modelling, a reference architecture
* an enterprise modelling language
* an integrating infrastructure for model enactment supported by
* a common terminology

A close liaison with European and international standardization organisations was established to stimulate the standardization process for enterprise integration.

CIMOSA aims at integrating enterprise operations by means of efficient information exchange within the enterprise. CIMOSA models enterprises using four perspectives: 
* the &quot;function view&quot; describes the functional structure required to satisfy the objectives of an enterprise and related control structures;
* the &quot;information view&quot; describes the information required by each function;
* the &quot;resource view&quot; describes the resources and their relations to functional and control structures; and
* the &quot;organization view&quot; describes the responsibilities assigned to individuals for functional and control structures.

==AMICE Consortium==
&quot;AMICE Consortium&quot; was a European organization of major companies concerned with computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM). It was initiated in 1985 and dissolved in 1995, and eventually included users, vendors, consulting companies, and academia. Among the participating companies were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Siemens, Fiat, and Daimler-Benz.

The AMICE Consortium was initiated as European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT) project to bring together stakeholders in the development of CIM for the development of new standards for CIM systems. This led to the development of the CIMOSA, which defined &quot;a comprehensive set of constructs sufficient to describe all aspects of manufacturing systems.&quot; It also established the CIMOSA Association.

=== Publications ===
The AMICE Consortium has published several books and papers. A selection:
* 1989. &quot;Open System Architecture for CIM, Research Report of ESPRIT Project 688&quot;, Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag. 
* 1991. &quot;Open System Architecture, CIMOSA, AD 1.0, Architecture Description&quot;, ESPRIT Consortium AMICE, Brussels, Belgium.

* 1993. &quot;CIMOSA: open system architecture for CIM&quot;, Springer, 1993.

===CIMOSA Association===
At the start of the 1990s the CIMOSA Association (COA) was founded as a non-profit organisation by the AMICE Consortium, aiming to promote enterprise engineering and integration (EE&amp;I) based on CIMOSA. It has extended its goals in the new millennium towards &quot;upcoming new enterprise paradigms of extended, virtual and agile enterprises, which cause new requirements on organisational concepts and supporting technologies. Enhanced decision support and operation monitoring and control are some of the needs of today and tomorrow. Capturing knowledge and using it across organisational boundaries will be a major challenge in the new types of businesses. This real-time knowledge needed to support the establishment, deployment and discontinuation of the inter and intra organisational relations&quot;.

From the start CIMOSA has been an active supporter for national, European and international standardization of Enterprise Integration.

In 2010 the CIMOSA Association closed due &quot;loss of membership according to people retirements.&quot;

<doc id="1145969" wikidata="Q391577" url="?curid=1145969" title="Rego Park">
<text>Rego Park is a neighborhood in the borough of Queens in New York City. Rego Park is bordered to the north by Elmhurst and Corona, to the east and south by Forest Hills, and to the west by Middle Village. Rego Park&#x27;s boundaries include Queens Boulevard, the Long Island Expressway, Woodhaven Boulevard, and Yellowstone Boulevard. There is a large Jewish population in the neighborhood, which features high-rise apartment buildings and detached houses, as well as a large commercial zone.

Rego Park is located in Queens Community District 6 and its ZIP Code is 11374. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 112th Precinct. Politically, Rego Park is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 29th District and a small part of the 24th and 25th Districts.

==History==
Rego Park is built on lands originally part of the Leni Lenape Nation, possibly inhabited by members of the Canarsee band. By 1653, though, English and Dutch farmers moved into the area and founded a community called Whitepot, which was a part of the Township of Newtown. Whitepot is believed to be so named because Dutch settlers named the area &quot;Whiteput&quot;, or &quot;hollow creek&quot;; later, English settlers Anglicized the name. The Remsen family created a burial ground, which is still located on Alderton Street near Metropolitan Avenue. The colonists also founded the Whitepot School, which operated until the late 19th century.

The area turned out to be good for farming, the colonists cultivated hay, straw, rye, corn, oats, and vegetables. The original Dutch, English, and German farmers sold their produce in Manhattan; by the end of the 19th century, though, Chinese farmers moved in and sold their goods exclusively to Chinatown.

The settlement was renamed Rego Park after the Real Good Construction Company, which began development of the area in 1925. &quot;Rego&quot; comes from the first two letters of the first two words of the company&#x27;s name. The company built 525 eight-room houses costing $8,000 each. Stores were built in 1926 on Queens Boulevard and 63rd Drive, and apartment buildings were built in 1927–1928. In 1930, the Independent Subway System began work on eight IND Queens Boulevard Line stations in the area, at a cost of $5 million. The subway extension was concurrent with the Real Good Construction Company&#x27;s completion of apartment buildings near Queens Boulevard and one-family homes throughout the rest of the neighborhood.

The short block of 63rd Drive between Austin Street and the Long Island Railroad overpass was the scene of a fire in February 1972 that claimed a row of stores and the neighborhood library. The blistering &quot;Rego Park Inferno&quot; reportedly started in the second store on the block from Austin Street, a shoe store, and quickly spread with the gusting winds to neighboring stores, including a television repair shop, toy store, pet shop and a pioneering Indian restaurant, and finally, the library, where row upon row of oily books and wooden shelves sent flames high into the sky and up the embankment of the railroad. Firefighters scrambled to keep the windswept flames from reaching an apartment house behind the stores, a new Key Food supermarket across Austin Street, or the Shell gas station just across the drive. The library caved in before flames could damage the electrical wires lining the railroad. A new library eventually opened across the street (on the former site of the Shell gas station). After the fire, until the new library was built, the community was served by a mobile &quot;Bookmobile&quot; library which parked under the LIRR tracks on 63rd Drive. A similar fire had decimated the same block in 1959.

==Demographics==

Based on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of Rego Park was 28,260, a decrease of 1,144 (3.9%) from the 29,404 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 46.2% (13,068) White, 2.5% (698) African American, 0.1% (41) Native American, 31.7% (8,966) Asian, 0.1% (7) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (124) from other races, and 2.4% (674) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 16.6% (4,682) of the population.

The entirety of Community Board 6, which comprises Rego Park and Forest Hills, had 115,119 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.4 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. The plurality of inhabitants are middle-aged and elderly adults: 31% are between the ages of 25 and 44, 28% between 45 and 64, and 19% over 64. The ratio of young and college-aged residents was lower, at 16% and 5% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 4 was $75,447. In 2018, an estimated 16% of Rego Park and Forest Hills residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in seventeen residents (6%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 50% in Rego Park and Forest Hills, lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Rego Park and Forest Hills is considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

===Ethnic enclaves===
Like its neighbor Forest Hills, Rego Park has long had a significant Jewish population, most of which have Georgian and Russian Jewish ancestors, with a number of synagogues and kosher restaurants. Many Holocaust survivors settled in Rego Park after 1945. In the 1990s, Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, especially from Central Asia, moved in. Most of the residents are Bukharan Jewish, and the effect of life in the Soviet Union on the population has led Rego Park to have a Russian feel with many signs in Russian Cyrillic. Most of the Bukharan Jewish immigrants in the neighborhood come from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and there is also Uzbek and Tajik cuisine in many Rego Park restaurants.

Immigrant populations from Albania, Bosnia, Israel, Romania, Iran, Colombia, South Asia, China, Bulgaria, Peru, and South Korea are also represented in the neighborhood, as well as many restaurants and stores operated by people of different nationalities. In the 2000s and 2010s, many young professionals also moved in, and the average price of residential units in Rego Park increased correspondingly.

==Land use==

===Housing===
Many apartment buildings, multi-family, and railroad houses make up the north side of Rego Park. Apartment complexes include The Carol House, Savoy Gardens, Jupiter Court, The Brussels, and Walden Terrace.

However, many houses in southern Rego Park are in the colonial, English, and Tudor styles with slate roofs. There are also two and multi-family townhouses, detached wood-frame houses. This is especially so in an area called the Crescents, named for its semicircular shaped streets emanating in a concentric pattern from Alderton Street, between Woodhaven Boulevard and the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Main Line. The Crescents contain many Tudor and single-family homes, as well as large lawns and tree plantings on the sidewalks. There are also many newer &quot;Fedders houses&quot;, so called because these newer houses are all cheaply made and uniform-looking, with the names of the air conditioners (usually of the Fedders brand) sticking out of the walls.

Vornado Realty Trust built a 312-unit residential tower on top of Rego Center Phase II, to accommodate a surge in young professionals moving into the area. About 20% of the units are studio apartments, with the rest being one- and two-bedroom apartments. In addition, other new residential projects are also under construction around the neighborhood.

===Commerce===

Rego Park is home to some of Queens&#x27; most popular shopping destinations, including the , 4-floor Rego Center. Phase I has several large retailers as well as a multilevel parking garage developed by Vornado Realty Trust. Phase II opened in 2010 with of retail space on 62nd Drive across from Rego Park Center, with more stores being built. It contained a small format IKEA, which opened in 2021 as the first of its type in the U.S. but closed in December 2022.

Across the Long Island Expressway, in nearby Elmhurst, is the Queens Center Mall. This mall opened on September 12, 1973, on land previously occupied by Fairyland, a supermarket, and automobile parking. The mall doubled in size from 2002 to 2004. The first Trader Joe&#x27;s in Queens opened in 2007 at 90–30 Metropolitan Avenue.

The main business thoroughfare of Rego Park is 63rd Drive. The main section extends from Woodhaven Boulevard in the south, to Queens Boulevard in the north, with the central business district of Rego Park nestled between Alderton Street (just south of the Long Island Railroad overpass), and Queens Boulevard. The stretch south of Alderton is entirely residential. The business district is anchored by The Rego Park School PS 139Q, an elementary school dating from 1928 and Our Saviour Lutheran Church established in 1926 which right across Wetherole Street from PS 139Q. The business district is criss-crossed by four side streets: Saunders, Booth, Wetherole, and Austin Streets. Most of the businesses lining 63rd Drive are the original single story &quot;Taxpayers&quot; dating from the 1930s.

Across Queens Boulevard to the north, 63rd Drive becomes 63rd Road, and its business district continues another three blocks; 63rd Drive actually shifts one block south of 63rd Road. There are many small businesses in this area. Shopping districts with many smaller stores, bakeries, pharmacies and restaurants can be found along 108th Street as well.

===Landmarks===

The Lost Battalion Hall, on Queens Boulevard, is named after nine companies of the 77th Infantry Division who fought in World War I. Now a community center, the structure was erected in 1939 as a hall for Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion. It was taken over as a community center by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1960 and is still operated as such. While the VFW maintains its offices at the building, the American Legion left in 1962. The site also contains a play area and a New York City Department of Environmental Protection water pumping station.

The Drake Theater, which opened in 1935 and closed in the 1990s, was used in the 1997 film &quot;Private Parts&quot;. The theater was damaged in December 1978 after around 500 people, complaining about the theater&#x27;s sound system threw beer and liquor bottles at the screen and tearing holes in it, smashing seats and the candy counter with fire extinguishers from the walls, and breaking all the glass doors at the entrance.

An AT&amp;T telephone building exists at Queens Boulevard and 62nd Drive.

Our Saviour Lutheran Church, open since the 1920s, conducts its services in English and Chinese.

The art deco Rego Park Jewish Center, opened in 1939, is notable for an A. Raymond Katz-designed façade with Old Testament scenes and symbols carved into it. The building is listed on both the New York State and National Register of Historic Places.

The Trylon Theater, an art deco theater built around the time of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, was converted to the home of the Education Center for Russian Jewry in 2006. After local furor over interior refurbishment, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission was considering landmarking the property. The theater, which closed in 2009, was repurposed into a synagogue for more than a decade, but in 2013, the synagogue&#x27;s congregation objected to their new landlord&#x27;s planned eviction of the synagogue. Largely composed of Russian Jews, the congregation had attempted, but failed, to buy the building in 2012.

===Notable roads===
* 63rd Road and Drive, the commercial artery of Rego Park, used to be Remsen&#x27;s Lane, which was named after the Remsen family who lived along the road.
* The Crescents were originally composed of streets named Asquith, Boelsen, Cromwell, Dieterle, Elwell and Fitchett. These names were chosen when the Real Good Construction Company developed the area in the 1920s.
* Horace Harding Expressway was once a turnpike called Nassau Boulevard and went from Elmhurst to Flushing, Bayside, and Little Neck. It was renamed for Horace J. Harding (1863–1929), a finance magnate who directed the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the New York Municipal Railways System; Harding encouraged city planner Robert Moses&#x27;s system of parkways on New York, and after Harding died, the boulevard—and later, service road to the Long Island Expressway—was renamed after him.
* Queens Boulevard, a wide at-grade highway that stretches from Long Island City to Jamaica, was formerly composed of two small dirt roads: Old Jamaica Road and Hoffman Boulevard. In the 1910s, it was paved and widened to 12 lanes. It is sometimes called the &quot;Boulevard of Death&quot; because of the high fatality rate of pedestrians trying to cross the 12-lane boulevard.
*Woodhaven Boulevard was known as Trotting Course Lane because it was named when horses were the main mode of transport. The lane dates back to the colonial days and used to run along Whitepot&#x27;s border Although it extends to Cross Bay Boulevard in the Rockaways, two small parts of the original lane still exist in Forest Hills.

<text>This article gives details on 2004 in music in the United Kingdom.

==Summary==
Michelle McManus, the winner of the second British series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, enjoyed success with her first single release, which topped the charts. Second and third place contestants Mark Rhodes and Sam Nixon formed a duo, whose debut single was a cover of &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, which also reached No.1. On 9 March Westlife became a four-piece after Brian McFadden decided to leave the band.

Numerous acts released greatest hits albums, with Robbie Williams&#x27; being most successful, selling over one million copies in eight weeks. Popular artists from the 1980s made successful returns, including Duran Duran, The Cure, Depeche Mode and Morrissey, all of whom released top ten singles. After appearing in the reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, Peter Andre re-released his 1996 hit single &quot;Mysterious Girl&quot;, this time getting to the top spot. Twenty years after the original, the Band Aid single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was re-recorded and was the best-selling single of the year, holding the Christmas number 1 spot. The song sold over a million copies in a month.

The most successful British pop acts of 2004 were McFly whose first two debut singles entered at number one, and Natasha Bedingfield, who topped the singles, album and download charts. The 2004 Children in Need single was &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot;. Former S Club star Rachel Stevens continued with her solo career, reaching the top 3 with the Sport Relief track &quot;Some Girls&quot;.

In the classical world, Karl Jenkins continued success as a composer was rewarded by a 10-year recording deal with EMI. His choral work, &quot;In These Stones Horizons Sing&quot;, was commissioned for the opening of the Wales Millennium Centre in November 2004. Newly appointed Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music Sir Peter Maxwell Davies continued his series of Naxos Quartets with nos. 4 and 5. Veteran composer Harrison Birtwistle produced a new opera, &quot;The Io Passion&quot;, which had its première in June at Snape Maltings as part of the Aldeburgh Festival.

<doc id="1145971" wikidata="Q7097399" url="?curid=1145971" title="Operation Planet X">
<text>During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Planet X was a US Army mechanized raid conducted on a village near Ad-Dawr in Salah Al-Din province north of Tikrit on the night of 15 May 2003 by elements of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, U.S. 4th Infantry Division and Task Force Ironhorse in search of Ba&#x27;ath party members and militants.

<text>The Dutch Grand Prix () is an annual Formula One World Championship auto racing event, held at Circuit Zandvoort, North Holland, the Netherlands, from 1950 through 1985, and after a 35 year hiatus, from 2021 to 2026.

It has been a part of the Formula One World Championship since 1952, and was designated the European Grand Prix twice, in 1962 and 1976, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe.

==History==

===Original circuit===
The town of Zandvoort is located on the North Sea coast of North Holland, close to the Dutch city of Amsterdam. There were minor races on a street circuit in the town in the 1930s but during the German invasion of the Netherlands a straight road was constructed through the dunes for the Germans to hold victory parades. The road was later connected to other roads opening access coastal defence positions.

After the war some of these roads were widened and linked together and a racing circuit was designed, not as legend has it by John Hugenholtz, but rather by a group of officials from the Royal Dutch Motorcycle Association, with advice from Bentley Boy Sammy Davis, who had won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1927. The first race took place in 1950. The edition, along with the 1951 event, was held as non-championship Formula One races, with Louis Rosier winning both years.

1952 was the year the Dutch Grand Prix was part of the third Formula One World Championship; this and the next year&#x27;s races were won by Italian Alberto Ascari. The race was not held in 1954 due to a lack of money to hold the race, and 1955 saw yet another demonstration of Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s dominance, with Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio and Briton Stirling Moss dominating the proceedings; Moss followed Fangio closely all the way. The 1956 and 1957 races were cancelled because of apparent lack of money, which was indirectly caused by the 1956–1957 Suez Crisis. The 1958 Dutch Grand Prix was won by Moss in a Vanwall. 1959 saw Swede Jo Bonnier win his only Formula One championship event and 1960 saw Dan Gurney have an accident and a spectator was killed; the race was won by Jack Brabham in a Cooper.

From 1963 to 1965 saw Briton Jim Clark win all three events, and 1967 saw the introduction of the Lotus 49 with its brand new Ford-Cosworth DFV engine. The DFV won on its debut with Clark driving; this engine became the most successful and widely used engine among private teams until 1985. The 1970 event saw the 49&#x27;s successor, the 72, win comprehensively with Jochen Rindt behind the wheel. However, tragedy struck during the race: Briton Piers Courage, driving for Frank Williams, crashed heavily near the notoriously fast Tunnel Oost corner after a wheel came off and hit him on the head, which killed him. The car, with Courage still in it, then caught fire and burned to the ground. The 1971 event saw Jacky Ickx win in a Ferrari after a spirited battle with Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a BRM in rain-soaked conditions. There was no 1972 race. It was originally on that year&#x27;s calendar, but the drivers refused to race at Zandvoort, because the facilities and conditions of the circuit were out-of-date with Grand Prix racing at that time.

===Redeveloped circuit===
Zandvoort had been extensively modified during its absence from the Grand Prix calendar. It had been lined with Armco and the cars were protected from the sand dunes and track-side obstacles. New pits were built, and the circuit also saw a chicane placed before Bosuit, the very high-speed corner that went into the pit-straight. For the 1973 race, in an indirect celebration of the efforts put forth, there was a special atmosphere at that weekend and everyone was happy, especially the organizers. But in a cruel twist of fate, that race was to be yet another black mark on Zandvoort&#x27;s history and reputation. In a race that was thought to be one of the most well organized Grands Prix yet seen, it was actually disorganization and a total lack of clear communication that would be ultimately responsible for what was to happen. On the eighth lap of the race, Briton Roger Williamson (in only his second ever Formula One race) crashed heavily near Tunnel Oost and his car caught fire while scraping along the tarmac. Williamson was uninjured during the crash; but time was running out; he could not free himself from the car. Williamson&#x27;s countryman David Purley stopped alongside, crossed the track and ran over to the burning March. Purley tried in vain to turn the car upright. There appeared to have been ample time to right the car and pull Williamson out, but as desperately as he tried, Purley was unable to do it by himself, and the marshals, who were not wearing flame retardant overalls, were unable and unwilling to help due to the intense heat. Race control assumed that it was Purley&#x27;s car that had crashed and that the driver had escaped unharmed. Many drivers who saw Purley waving them down to stop assumed that he was trying to put a fire out from his own car, having safely exited it, and thus did not know that a second driver had been involved. As a result, the race continued at full pace while Purley desperately tried to save the life of Williamson. Due to a group of race officials standing around Williamson&#x27;s burning car doing absolutely nothing to help and even hindering the situation (by throwing away the fire extinguisher Purley was using over the Armco and down a slope), this did not work, and Williamson died not of skin burns but of asphyxiation. Purley was later awarded the George Medal for his actions. The race was won by Tyrrell driver Jackie Stewart (who broke Jim Clark&#x27;s record for the most career Grand Prix victories that weekend) and his teammate François Cevert finished 2nd; but no one felt like celebrating; it was one of the darkest moments in the history of the sport.

1974 saw the re-emerging Ferrari team dominate with Austrian Niki Lauda winning; and 1975 saw Briton James Hunt win his first championship Formula One race in his Hesketh. 1976 saw Hunt win again while Lauda was recovering from his dreadful crash at the Nürburgring. 1977 was probably remembered for an incident between Hunt and American Mario Andretti. Andretti attempted ambitiously to pass Hunt at the 180-degree Tarzan corner; the two cars touched and both were out of the race. Andretti won the 1978 running; his last Formula One victory. 1979 saw a change to the circuit to slow cars coming into Tunnel Oost; there was a high-speed temporary chicane put there. Canadian Gilles Villeneuve had crashed there while battling ferociously with Australian Alan Jones and damaged his left-rear suspension. Though he carried on, at the start of the next lap he went off again at Tarzan. Refusing to give up, Villeneuve, to the shock of many, went into reverse gear and drove his Ferrari out of the muddy run-off area and back onto the circuit. About halfway around the next lap, the car&#x27;s left rear rim, wheel, and suspension totally shattered and was dragged by the car as it went along, making the Ferrari nearly impossible to drive. Villeneuve, displaying his now legendary car control, made it back to the pits without crashing or going off and retired from the race; the Grand Prix was won by Jones. 1980 saw the chicane removed and replaced by a slower chicane before Tunnel Oost. 1981 saw a big battle between Frenchman Alain Prost in a Renault and Jones in a Williams; Prost came out on top to win. The 1982 event was won by Frenchman Didier Pironi in a Ferrari; his countryman René Arnoux had a dreadful crash at the end of the pit straight going into Tarzan; his front suspension failed on his ground-effect Renault and he went head on into the barriers; fortunately he was uninjured. 1983 saw a battle between championship contenders Prost and Brazilian Nelson Piquet. Prost attempted to pass Piquet at Tarzan but the Frenchman punted Piquet off and Prost crashed soon afterwards. Prost won from pole in 1984. In 1985, Lauda took his 25th and final Grand Prix victory while holding off his charging McLaren teammate Prost near the end of the race.

1985 was the race&#x27;s final running, as the company that ran the circuit (CENAV) went out of business, marking the end of the old Zandvoort circuit. The track, owned by the municipality of Zandvoort, was not used for some time and part of the grounds and approximately half of the track was sold in 1987 to Vendorado, a bungalow park developer at that time. The track was eventually redesigned and remained in use for other disciplines of motorsport.

=== 2021–present ===
On 14 May 2019, the Dutch Grand Prix at the Zandvoort track was announced for the Formula One calendar. In March 2020 the return of event was postponed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was later cancelled altogether with the event&#x27;s return slated for , where home favourite Max Verstappen took the victory. Verstappen won the 2022 and 2023 races, with his streak of pole positions and victories at the Grand Prix since its return in 2021 being broken in 2024 with Lando Norris both taking pole and winning the race. The Dutch Grand Prix is contracted to be held at Zandvoort until 2026. After that, the Grand Prix would not be part of the calendar anymore, since the local promoter decided not to seek a contract extension beyond 2026.

<text>Frans Masereel (31 July 1889 – 3 January 1972) was a Belgian painter and graphic artist who worked mainly in France. He is known especially for his woodcuts which focused on political and social issues, such as war and capitalism. He completed over 40 wordless novels in his career, and among these, his greatest is generally said to be &quot;Passionate Journey&quot;.

Masereel&#x27;s woodcuts influenced Lynd Ward and later graphic artists such as Clifford Harper, Eric Drooker, and Otto Nückel.

==Biography==

===Upbringing===
Frans Masereel was born in the Belgian coastal town Blankenberge in West Flanders on 31 July 1889, and at the age of five, his father died. His mother moved the family to Ghent in 1896. She met and married a physician with strong Socialist convictions, and the family together regularly protested against the appalling working conditions of the Ghent textile workers.

===Education===

At the age of 18 he began to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in the class of Jean Delvin. His culture, first revolutionary and then anti-militarist, was shaped by reading Russian works such as those of Kropotkin, translated by his Aunt Fanny. In 1909, he visited England and Germany, which inspired him to make his first etchings and woodcuts. In 1911 Masereel settled in Paris for four years and then emigrated to Switzerland, where he worked as a graphic artist for journals and magazines. 
===Emigre===

Masereel could not return to Belgium at the end of World War I because, being a pacifist, he had refused to serve in the Belgian army. Nonetheless, when a circle of friends in Antwerp interested in art and literature decided to found the magazine &quot;Lumière&quot;, Masereel was one of the artists invited to illustrate the text and the column headings. The magazine was first published in Antwerp in August 1919. It was an artistic and literary journal published in French. The magazine&#x27;s title &quot;Lumière&quot; was a reference to the French magazine &quot;Clarté&quot;, which was published in Paris by Henri Barbusse. The principal artists who illustrated the text and the column headings in addition to Masereel himself were Jan Frans Cantré, Jozef Cantré, Henri van Straten, and Joris Minne. Together, they became known as &#x27;De Vijf&#x27; or &#x27;Les Cinq&#x27; (&#x27;The Five&#x27;). &quot;Lumière&quot; was a key force in generating renewed interest in wood engraving in Belgium. The five artists in the &#x27;De Vijf&#x27; group were instrumental in popularizing the art of wood, copper and linoleum engraving and introducing Expressionism in early 20th-century Belgium.

In 1921 Masereel returned to Paris, where he painted his famous street scenes, the Montmartre paintings. He lived for a time in Berlin, where his closest creative friend was George Grosz. After 1925 he lived near Boulogne-sur-Mer, where he painted predominantly coast areas, harbour views, and portraits of sailors and fishermen. During the 1930s his output declined. With the Fall of France to the Nazis in 1940 he fled from Paris and lived in several cities in Southern France.

===Post-World-War II===

At the end of World War II Masereel was able to resume his artistic work and produced woodcuts and paintings. After 1946 he taught at the Hochschule der Bildenden Künste Saar in Saarbrücken. In 1949 Masereel settled in Nice. Between 1949 and 1968, he published several series of woodcuts that differ from his earlier &quot;novels in picture&#x27;&quot; in comprising variations on a subject instead of a narrative. He had also designed decorations and costumes for numerous theatre productions. The artist was honoured in numerous exhibitions and became a member of several academies.

===Death===

Frans Masereel died in Avignon in 1972 and was buried in Ghent.

==Legacy==

===Influence===

Masereel&#x27;s woodcuts influenced Lynd Ward and later graphic artists such as George Walker, Clifford Harper, Eric Drooker, and &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoonist Peter Arno.

Masereel&#x27;s woodcut series, mainly of sociocritical content and expressionistic in form, made Masereel internationally known. Among them were the wordless novels &quot;25 Images of a Man&#x27;s Passion&quot; (1918), &quot;Passionate Journey&quot; (1919), &quot;The Sun&quot; (1919), &quot;The Idea&quot; (1920), &quot;Story Without Words&quot; (1920), and &quot;Landscapes and Voices&quot; (1929). At that time Masereel also drew illustrations for famous works of world literature by Thomas Mann, Émile Zola, and Stefan Zweig. He also produced a series of illustrations for the classic &quot;Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak&quot; by his fellow Belgian Charles De Coster; these illustrations followed the book in its translations to numerous languages.
===Namesakes===

The cultural organization Masereelfonds was named after him, as was the Frans Masereel Centre studio facility at Kasterlee.

<text>Jukebox Sparrows is the first full length album by American singer-songwriter Shannon McNally, released in 2002 (see 2002 in music).

==Critical reception==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic concludes his review by saying, &quot;This is very much a debut -- at times it&#x27;s hard to not wish it would soar a little higher or shake off the formula of its genre -- but it&#x27;s a very enjoyable, promising debut from an artist who could turn into something special.&quot;

Eden Miller of &quot;PopMatters&quot; writes, &quot;Even though &quot;Jukebox Sparrows&quot; makes a couple mistakes along the way, it is an impressive debut that clearly shows the abilities of this powerful singer and songwriter.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; writes, &quot;Produced by Ron Aniello over 11 months at Cello Studios in Los Angeles, &quot;Jukebox Sparrows&quot; reveals itself as a surprisingly confident musical and lyrical offering for such a young songwriter.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&#x27;s&quot; Mark Jenkins writes, &quot;the singer has a taste for country, blues and gospel that would seem incongruous if she didn&#x27;t boast the sort of voice that could stir a Pentecostal congregation.&quot;

<text>A cascade converter is a type of motor-generator which was patented in 1902 by J. L. la Cour and O. S. Bragstad.

It consists of an induction motor driving a dynamo through a shaft. In addition, the rotor of the induction motor is electrically connected to the armature of the dynamo.

When the machine is running, half the power is transmitted mechanically through the shaft while the other half is transmitted electrically. 

The advantage of this arrangement is that the machine can be smaller than a conventional motor-generator of the same power.

The British manufacturing rights for the cascade converter were held by Bruce Peebles &amp; Co. Ltd. of Edinburgh.

<text>Lights Out is an electronic game released by Tiger Electronics in 1995. The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off, preferably with as few button presses as possible.

&quot;Merlin&quot;, a similar electronic game, was released by Parker Brothers in the 1970s with similar rules on a 3 by 3 grid. Another similar game was produced by Vulcan Electronics in 1983 under the name &quot;XL-25&quot;. Tiger Toys also produced a cartridge version of &quot;Lights Out&quot; for its Game com handheld game console in 1997, shipped free with the console.
A number of new puzzles similar to &quot;Lights Out&quot; have been released, such as &quot;Lights Out 2000&quot; (5×5 with multiple colors), &quot;Lights Out Cube&quot; (six 3×3 faces with effects across edges), and &quot;Lights Out Deluxe&quot; (6×6).

== Inventors ==

&quot;Lights Out&quot; was created by a group of people including Avi Olti, Gyora Benedek, Zvi Herman, Revital Bloomberg, Avi Weiner and Michael Ganor. The members of the group together and individually also invented several other games, such as Hidato, NimX, iTop and many more.

== Gameplay ==
The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the four adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off, preferably in as few button presses as possible.

=== Mathematics ===
If a light is on, it must be toggled an odd number of times to be turned off. If a light is off, it must be toggled an even number of times (including none at all) for it to remain off. Several conclusions are used for the game&#x27;s strategy. Firstly, the order in which the lights are pressed does not matter, as the result will be the same. Secondly, in a minimal solution, each light needs to be pressed no more than once, because pressing a light twice is equivalent to not pressing it at all.

In 1998, Marlow Anderson and Todd Feil used linear algebra to prove that not all configurations are solvable and also to prove that there are exactly four winning scenarios, not including redundant moves, for any solvable 5×5 problem. The 5×5 grid of &quot;Lights Out&quot; can be represented as a 25x1 column vector with a 1 and 0 signifying a light in its on and off state respectively. Each entry is an element of Z2, the field of integers modulo 2. Anderson and Feil found that in order for a configuration to be solvable (deriving the null vector from the original configuration) it must be orthogonal to the two vectors N1 and N2 below (pictured as a 5×5 array but not to be confused with matrices).

formula_1

In addition, they found that N1 and N2 can be used to find three additional solutions from a solution, and that these four solutions are the only four solutions (excluding redundant moves) to the starting given configuration. These four solutions are X, X + N1, X + N2, and X + N1 + N2 where X is a solution to the starting given configuration. An introduction into this method was published by Robert Eisele.

=== Light chasing ===
&quot;Light chasing&quot; is a method similar to Gaussian elimination which always solves the puzzle (if a solution exists), although with the possibility of many redundant steps. In this approach, rows are manipulated one at a time starting with the top row. All the lights are disabled in the row by toggling the adjacent lights in the row directly below. The same method is then used on the consecutive rows up to the last one. The last row is solved separately, depending on its active lights. Corresponding lights (see table below) in the top row are toggled and the initial algorithm is run again, resulting in a solution.

Tables and strategies for other board sizes are generated by playing &quot;Lights Out&quot; with a blank board and observing the result of bringing a particular light from the top row down to the bottom row.

=== Further results ===
Once a single solution is found, a solution with the minimum number of moves can be determined through elimination of redundant sets of button presses that have no cumulative effect.

Existence of solutions has been proved for a wide variety of board configurations, such as hexagonal, while solutions to n-by-n boards for n≤200 have been explicitly constructed.

There exists a solution for every N×N case. It is solvable on any undirected graph, where clicking on one vertex flips its value and its neighbours. More generally if the action matrix is symmetric then its diagonal is always solvable.

<doc id="1145992" wikidata="Q5461716" url="?curid=1145992" title="Florida cracker">
<text>Florida crackers were colonial-era British American pioneer settlers in what is now the U.S. state of Florida; the term is also applied to their descendants, to the present day, and their subculture among white Southerners. The first crackers arrived in 1763 after Spain traded Florida to Great Britain following Britain&#x27;s victory over France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, though much of traditional Florida cracker folk culture dates to the 19th century.

==Historical usage==
The term &quot;cracker&quot; was in use during the Elizabethan era to describe braggarts and blowhards. The original root of this is the Middle English word , meaning &quot;entertaining conversation&quot; (which survives as a verb, as in &quot;to crack a joke&quot;); the noun in the Gaelicized spelling &quot;craic&quot; also retains currency in Ireland and to some extent in Scotland and Northern England, in a sense of &#x27;fun&#x27; or &#x27;entertainment&#x27; especially in a group setting. &quot;Cracker&quot; is documented in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King John&quot;, Act II, Scene I (1595): &quot;What cracker is this same that deafs our ears / With this abundance of superfluous breath?&quot;

By the 1760s, the ruling classes in Britain and the American colonies applied the term &quot;cracker&quot; to Scots-Irish, Scottish, and English American settlers of the remote southern back country, as noted in a letter to the Earl of Dartmouth: &quot;I should explain to your Lordship what is meant by Crackers; a name they have got from being great boasters; they are a lawless set of rascalls on the frontiers of Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas, and Georgia, who often change their places of abode.&quot; 

The word was later associated with the cattlemen of Georgia and Florida, many of them descendants of those early colonists who had migrated south. A folk etymology suggests that the name instead derives from the cracking of cattle-drovers&#x27; whips.

==Florida cowmen==

In Florida, those who own or work cattle traditionally have been called &quot;cowmen&quot;. In the late 19th century they were often called &quot;cowhunters&quot;, a reference to seeking out cattle scattered over the wooded rangelands during roundups. At times, the terms &quot;cowman&quot; and &quot;cracker&quot; have been used interchangeably because of similarities in their folk culture. However, the western term &quot;cowboy&quot; which is often used for those who work cattle is not the common Florida vernacular as is &quot;cowman&quot; or &quot;cowhunter&quot;.

The Florida &quot;cowhunter&quot; or &quot;cracker cowman&quot; of the 19th and early 20th centuries was distinct from the Spanish and the cowboy. Florida cattlemen&#x27;s primary tools were dogs and cow whips to herd or capture cattle while also utilizing lassos. Florida cattle and horses were smaller than the western breeds. The Florida Cracker cattle, also known as the &quot;native&quot; or &quot;scrub&quot; cow, averaged about and had large horns and large feet.

==Modern usage==
Among some Floridians, the term is used as a proud or jocular self-description. Since the huge influx of new residents into Florida in the late 20th and early 21st centuries from the northern United States and from Latin America, the term &quot;Florida cracker&quot; is used informally by some Floridians to indicate that their families have lived in the state for many generations. It is considered a source of pride to be descended from &quot;frontier people who did not just live but flourished in a time before air conditioning, mosquito repellent, and screens&quot; according to Florida history writer Dana Ste. Claire.

Since the late 20th century, the Cracker Storytelling Festival has been held annually in the fall at Homeland Heritage Park in Homeland, Florida. 2013 marked the 25th anniversary of the festival, which includes storytellers from around Florida who come to share their stories with visitors. The majority of visitors who attend this event are students, because storytelling is part of the Florida educational curriculum. The festival also incorporates local crafts and artwork, food vendors, a whip-cracking contest, and living-history re-enactment of 19th-century homestead life.

<doc id="1145996" wikidata="Q430701" url="?curid=1145996" title="George W. Casey Jr.">
<text>George William Casey Jr. (born 22 July 1948) is a retired four-star general who served as the 36th Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 10 April 2007 to 10 April 2011. He served as Commanding General, Multi-National Force – Iraq from June 2004 to 8 February 2007, and was in the army for his entire adult working life. He now resides in Arlington, Virginia.

==Early life and education==
Casey was born in Sendai during the Allied occupation of Japan. His father, George W. Casey Sr., was a West Point graduate who rose to the rank of major general and served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. His father commanded the 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam. He was killed on 7 July 1970, when his command helicopter crashed in South Vietnam en route to a hospital to visit wounded American soldiers.

Casey, a military brat, grew up on army posts in the United States, Japan, and Germany and graduated from Boston College High School in Boston, Massachusetts. After high school, he applied to West Point, like his father, but was unsuccessful. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in international relations from Georgetown University in 1970 and later a Master of Arts degree in international relations from the University of Denver in 1980. Additionally, Casey worked for Vince Lombardi during one summer when the latter was coach of the Washington Redskins.

==Career==

Casey was commissioned through the Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps in 1970 following graduation from Georgetown University. In 1990–1991, he attended MIT Seminar XXI.

Casey served in the Mechanized Infantry during the command portion of his career. He was the commander of the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division, and the Assistant Division Commander – Maneuver (later Assistant Division Commander – Support) of the 1st Armored Division in Germany. He deployed as part of Operation Joint Endeavor to Bosnia-Herzegovina from July 1996 to August 1997. He and the Rear Command Post staff were based in Slavonski Brod, Croatia. Casey took command of the 1st Armored Division in July 1999.

After relinquishing command of the division in July 2001, Casey served in a senior staff position in the Pentagon as the Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5), the Joint Staff from October 2001 to January 2003. His next position was Director of the Joint Staff in Washington, D.C. from January 2003 to October 2003. Following these assignments, Casey was nominated and confirmed as the 30th Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, serving in that post until June 2004.

===Multi-National Force – Iraq===
Casey served as the senior coalition commander in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2007. He replaced Lieutenant General Ricardo S. Sanchez. Casey&#x27;s goal was to encourage the Iraqis to take ownership of their problems and responsibility for their own security. For his part as a military commander, he focused on training Iraqi forces, limiting the role of American forces, and transferring the burden for providing security to Iraqi forces. Meanwhile, U.S. diplomats would focus on building and strengthening the Iraqi government and help the Iraqis hold elections. He expressed his view that a large and intrusive American presence in Iraq would not solve the political and security problems in that country and could even fuel the insurgency.

In 2005, Casey was hopeful the December 2005 Iraqi elections could lead to a more unified and moderate Iraq which—in conjunction with the training of Iraqi security forces—could pave the way for U.S. troop reductions in early 2006. In August 2005, Casey used specific troop numbers in his public discussion of a possible drawdown. He said the troop level of 138,000 could be reduced by 30,000 in the early months of 2006 as Iraqi security forces took on a greater role. President George W. Bush publicly called the talk &quot;speculation&quot; and rebuked the general. The bombing of the al-Askari Mosque, a sacred Shia religious site in Samarra, is believed to have stoked sectarian tensions and derailed coalition plans to speedily transfer significant security responsibility to the Iraqi government by the end of 2006.

In January 2007, Casey implied his opposition to a troop surge:

===Army Chief of Staff===
In January 2007, President George W. Bush nominated Casey for elevation to Chief of Staff of the Army. Opposition to the nomination came from Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham who questioned Casey&#x27;s leadership in Iraq, with McCain&#x27;s criticisms focused on Casey&#x27;s &quot;optimistic and rosy scenarios&quot; of progress in the Iraq War. In spite of this, the Senate confirmed his nomination on 8 February 2007, with a bipartisan vote of 83–14.

On 10 February 2007, Casey relinquished command in Iraq to General David Petraeus. Casey officially succeeded General Peter Schoomaker as Chief of Staff of the Army on 10 April 2007.

As the 36th Chief of Staff of the United States Army from April 2007 to 2011, Casey led what is arguably the world&#x27;s largest and most complex organization—1.1 million people strong, with a $200+ billion annual budget—during one of the most extraordinary periods in military and global political history. He became Chief of Staff of an Army that was stretched from 6 years of continuous war. Over his tenure he stabilized and transformed the army to meet the challenges of the 21st century while continuing to meet the demands of two wars. Casey transformed an army trained and prepared for conventional war, to an agile force more suited to modern challenges.

Casey accelerated the growth of the army, instituted Retention Bonuses for young officers, increased the funding for soldier and family programs, improved the way the army cared for its wounded soldiers and surviving family members and drove down the stigma associated with behavioral health counseling to stabilize an army stretched by war. He also improved the leadership training for the army&#x27;s General Officer Corps, advanced the transformation of the army&#x27;s business and decision-making processes, moved the army onto a rotational deployment program much like the Marine Corps&#x27; and oversaw a substantial improvement in the capabilities of the Army National Guard and Army Reserves.

In the immediate aftermath of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting committed by United States Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, Casey expressed concern about jumping to conclusions before the investigation was completed, telling CNN&#x27;s John King that &quot;this increased speculation could cause a backlash against some of our Muslim soldiers&quot; and &quot;As great a tragedy as this was, it would be a shame if our diversity became a casualty as well.&quot; Several months later, in a February 2010 interview, Casey said: &quot;Our diversity not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength. And as horrific as this tragedy was, if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that&#x27;s worse.&quot;

==Retirement==
Casey retired on 11 April 2011. Casey, whose parents were from Massachusetts, moved to Arlington, Virginia upon his retirement. Casey is currently a Distinguished Senior Lecturer of Leadership at Cornell University&#x27;s Johnson Graduate School of Management as well as a teaching fellow at the University of Virginia&#x27;s Darden School of Business.

<text>MetaCard is a discontinued cross-platform, commercial HyperCard clone. MetaCard included an IDE, a GUI toolkit and had its own language, MetaTalk. From the MetaCard Corporation website: &quot;The MetaTalk language has all the features common to third-generation languages like C/C++/Java but has a much simpler syntax.&quot;

Cross Worlds Computing developed applications on the MetaCard platform (e.g., Ten Thumbs Typing Tutor) and developed their own MetaCard IDE called Revolution. They agreed to take over MetaCard development adding the language and runtime to Revolution and changed their name to Runtime Revolution (RunRev). RunRev did not adapt the original MetaCard IDE and it was made available as free and open-source software via a Yahoo! group and a RunRev hosted mailing list. Runtime Revolution changed the name of Revolution to LiveCode and then changed their name to LiveCode, Ltd. as well.

<text>Guy Anson Maunsell (1 September 1884 – 20 June 1961) was the British civil engineer responsible for the design of the Maunsell Forts used by the United Kingdom for the defence of the Thames and Mersey estuaries during World War II.

==Early life==
Maunsell was born in 1884 in Srinagar, Kashmir in British India, one of three children of a military family. His father, Edward Henry Maunsell (1837–1913) was of Anglo-Irish ancestry, and was a captain in the 5th Dragoon Guards and 15th Hussars. His mother, Rosalie Harriet Anson (1852–1922), was born in Guernsey; the couple had married in Bombay Cathedral in 1878. He was related distantly to General Sir Frederick Richard Maunsell (1828–1916) of the Royal Bengal Engineers. Young Guy was sent to school in England at Eastbourne College between 1897 and 1903, and studied civil engineering at the Central Institution of the City &amp; Guilds of London Institute, South Kensington.

Although he graduated with first class honours in 1906, he did not find immediate employment and travelled the country making watercolour paintings. The next year, he became an assistant to Swiss engineer Adrien Palaz (1863–1930), professor of Industrial Electricity at the University of Lausanne, where he learned the latest techniques associated with reinforced concrete. In 1909 he secured a job with Easton Gibb &amp; Son who were engaged in the construction of the Rosyth Dockyard. In July 1914, Maunsell moved to R. Thorburn and Sons as their chief agent and was responsible for building two TNT factories for the British Government.

==World War I==
In 1917, Maunsell was conscripted as a commissioned officer in the Royal Engineers and spent a year on the Western Front. Recalled to England, he worked as chief engineer at John Ver Mehr&#x27;s yard in Shoreham, engaged with the construction of concrete tugs and barges known as the Shoreham Creteships. He was also involved with the concrete and steel towers for the Admiralty M-N Scheme, which were intended to close the Strait of Dover to U-boats. A single tower remains today as the lighthouse Nab Tower.

In 1955 he founded the business G. Maunsell &amp; Partners in the United Kingdom which pioneered the use of pre-stressed concrete for major bridges. The Hammersmith Flyover, completed in 1961, made early use of this new construction method and many more such structures followed. The company expanded to Australia, Hong Kong and the Middle East and in time merged with Oscar Faber &amp; Partners to form Faber Maunsell, and ultimately became part of the US-based AECOM Group.

He died at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England on 20 June 1961.

<text>Eye for Eye (1987) is a science fiction novella by Orson Scott Card.

Card originally submitted the story to &quot;Analog&quot; magazine, but it was rejected. It ultimately ran in the March 1987 issue of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; magazine. In 1990 it appeared in Card&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Maps in a Mirror&quot; and also as a Tor double novel, with &quot;The Tunesmith&quot; by Lloyd Biggle, Jr. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1988.

==Plot summary==
Mick Winger has an unusual gift and with it has accidentally killed several people. When Mick gets angry at people, his power manifests itself by launching an attack upon them by giving them cancer, leukemia or related terminal illnesses. If made angry enough, his anger can outright kill the victim.

Mick was raised in an orphanage and along his journey to manhood unintentionally killed several people who mistreated him, as well as nearly everyone he loved, though nearly every occurrence was accidental. The only intentional murder he describes while growing up is being nearly molested in a Denny&#x27;s bathroom. This is when he discovers the intensity of the attacks are greatly heightened when he&#x27;s touching a target. When fifteen, he fled child custody and set out on his own.

When Mick becomes angry, he gets, as he describes it, &quot;sparky.&quot; He can see sparks surrounding and enveloping him and then those sparks lashing out on the object of his anger. Unavoidably, those attacked by his &quot;sparks&quot; end up with terminal illnesses and soon die. The effect of his attack is much more pronounced if he is touching the victim.

Until he was a young man, Mick had no idea he was different from other children. He discovered he was different when describing &quot;sparkiness&quot; with other children, who had no idea what he was talking about.

Soon after setting out on his own, he encounters a young woman who not only knows about his gift, but who even seems to possess the same gift, although to a lesser extent. She however possesses the ability to &quot;call,&quot; to influence Mick so that he unintentionally heads straight for her, as well as intense sexual attraction, which she describes as simple pheromones that all people have, except that people like Mick, due to a different biochemical makeup (though Mick doesn&#x27;t understand this when it is first explained to him), is far more susceptible to these pheromones than a normal human being.

Eventually he is led back to his birth parents, who are members of a mysterious, secluded colony. Talking to his parents, who also possess his ability, he learns he is far more powerful than they or probably anyone else at the colony. Mick learns that what he sees as &quot;sparks&quot; his family only sees as dust; he even begins to realize that he can see when people are lying. After being brought to the village&#x27;s Patriarch, Papa Lem, Mick learns the intent of the colony and how they operate. Mick then refuses to &quot;spread his seed&quot; with the daughter of Papa Lem and returns to his parents&#x27; house for the night. During the night, Mick is attacked by an agent of Papa Lem and others from the village. Mick ends up killing his father and setting fire to the village while at the same time learning new extents to his abilities.

After fleeing the village on foot, Mick runs into the girl he met when he first set out on his own. The assailants from the village quickly catch up with the duo and start firing at them. The woman, unbeknown to Mick, is shot in the back of the head just as they reach their allies. Mick pulls the girl from her wrecked car and puts all his &quot;sparkiness&quot; into her just before passing out.

Mick awakes in the lair of his new allies. Upon questioning, Mick learns that the girl is alive and that he had somehow healed her from the bullet wound. Mick is on his way to officially meet the young lady when the story abruptly ends.

<doc id="1146033" wikidata="Q40444" url="?curid=1146033" title="Kevin McHale (basketball)">
<text>Kevin Edward McHale (born December 19, 1957) is an American former professional basketball player, coach and analyst who played his entire professional career for the Boston Celtics. He earned the nickname &quot;the Torture Chamber&quot; for his exceptional footwork and post skills that consistently overwhelmed opponents. He is a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and is regarded as one of the greatest power forwards of all time.

After a high school career in which he was named Minnesota Mr. Basketball, he attended the University of Minnesota, where he was named to two first-team All Conference teams and set many team records that still stand today. He was selected third overall in the 1980 NBA draft by the Celtics, and spent his first six seasons as a valuable bench player, backing up forwards Cedric Maxwell and Larry Bird, being twice named the NBA&#x27;s Sixth Man of the Year, awarded each season to the league&#x27;s best bench player. After Maxwell was traded prior to the 1985–1986 season, McHale became a starter alongside Bird and center Robert Parish, where the three formed what is often considered one of the best front-court trios in NBA history. He won three NBA championships with the Celtics in 1981, 1984 and 1986. Having already played in an NBA All-Star game as a bench player, after moving to starter he played in an additional six All-Star games, and was named all-NBA Defensive team six total times. After injuries forced his retirement following the 1992–1993 season, he was later named to both the NBA&#x27;s 50th and 75th anniversary teams.

McHale began working for the Minnesota Timberwolves immediately following his retirement in 1993 (until 2009) and at different times, as a TV analyst, general manager, and a head coach. He was the head coach of the Houston Rockets from 2011 to 2015 until being fired following a 4–7 start to the 2015–16 season.

==Early life==
McHale was born to Paul Austin McHale and Josephine Patricia Starcevic in Hibbing, Minnesota. In his senior season at Hibbing High School, he was named Minnesota Mr. Basketball in 1976 and led his team to a runner-up finish in the AA Minnesota State Championship game.

He is of Croatian descent on his mother&#x27;s side and Irish on his father&#x27;s.

==College career==
The 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) McHale played basketball at the power forward position for the University of Minnesota (the Golden Gophers) from 1976 to 1980, with career averages of 15.2 points and 8.5 rebounds per game.

He was named All-Big Ten in 1979 and 1980 and still ranks second in school history in career points (1704) and rebounds (950).

In 1995, to coincide with the University of Minnesota basketball&#x27;s 100th anniversary, he was selected as the top player in the history of University of Minnesota men&#x27;s basketball.

McHale had an encounter with Chuck Foreman in the Gopher locker room. Foreman, a famous Minnesota Viking at the time, was congratulating the Gophers on a hard-fought victory. As Foreman was shaking all the players&#x27; hands, when he arrived at the then-unknown power forward, McHale displayed his comic wit: &quot;Nice to meet you, Mr. Foreman. What do you do for a living?&quot;

==NBA playing career==

===Coming off the bench, the &quot;Sixth Man&quot; (1980–1985)===

Entering the 1980 NBA draft, the Celtics held the number one overall pick, but in a pre-draft trade, considered by many to be among the most lopsided in NBA history, Celtics president Red Auerbach dealt the pick and an additional first-round pick to the Golden State Warriors for center Robert Parish and the Warriors&#x27; first-round pick, the third overall, which the Celtics used to draft McHale.
McHale&#x27;s stay in Boston got off to a rocky start as he held out for a large contract, even threatening to play in Italy, before signing a three-year deal with the Celtics. Backing up Cedric Maxwell at forward, McHale made an immediate impact and was named to the NBA&#x27;s All-Rookie First Team in his rookie season. Boston finished McHale&#x27;s rookie season with a league-leading record of 62–20.

In the playoffs, the Celtics swept the Chicago Bulls in the first round. In the Eastern Conference finals, the Celtics faced a 3–1 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers; but Boston won the last three games of the series, including Game 6 on Philadelphia&#x27;s home court. McHale helped save the Game 6 win by rejecting an Andrew Toney shot and corralling the rebound with 16 seconds left to protect the Celtics&#x27; one-point lead. In the NBA Finals, Boston defeated the Houston Rockets in six games to capture the team&#x27;s 14th championship.

The Celtics failed to advance to the NBA Finals the next two seasons. Philadelphia exacted a measure of revenge in the 1982 Eastern Conference final, beating Boston at home in the seventh game. In the 1983 Eastern Conference semifinals, the Celtics were swept by the Milwaukee Bucks. This embarrassing defeat led to the firing of head coach Bill Fitch and a temporarily unhappy McHale.

Following the 1982–83 season, McHale&#x27;s contract with the Celtics expired, and the New York Knicks signed him to a contract offer sheet. Auerbach retaliated by signing three of New York&#x27;s top free-agent players to offer sheets. The Knicks elected to re-sign their players and give up their pursuit of McHale. McHale eventually re-signed with Boston, his $1 million per season contract making him the fourth-highest paid player in the NBA.

McHale won the first of his consecutive NBA Sixth Man Awards as Boston won a league-best 62 games in the 1983–84 season. With the hiring of new head coach, former Celtic KC Jones and the acquisition of Phoenix Suns guard Dennis Johnson, Boston seemed primed to make yet another run at a 15th championship.

After surviving a seven-game semifinal battle with the Knicks, the Celtics avenged the previous season&#x27;s playoff loss to Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference Finals. Boston would face the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals in a highly anticipated matchup.

In Game 4 of the finals, with the Celtics trailing in both the game and the series, McHale delivered a hard foul to Kurt Rambis as the Lakers&#x27; forward raced to the basket. The physical play touched off a bench-clearing scuffle. Boston came back to win the game in overtime and tie the series at two games apiece. They eventually prevailed in seven games to win the franchise&#x27;s 15th championship.

McHale continued to come off the bench during the first half of the 1984–1985 season, but moved into a starting role in February 1985 after Cedric Maxwell suffered a knee injury. On March 3 versus the Detroit Pistons McHale enjoyed his greatest scoring night, setting the Celtics&#x27; single-game scoring record with 56 points. Two nights later McHale scored 42 points against the Knicks, the only other time in his career he topped 40 points in a game. The 98 points in consecutive games is still a Celtics&#x27; record. Nine days after McHale had scored 56 points, Larry Bird established a new Celtics&#x27; single-game scoring mark by pouring in 60 points versus the Atlanta Hawks.

Boston captured its second straight Eastern Conference title but was upended in the NBA Finals in six games by the rival Lakers. McHale led the Celtics in scoring (26.0) and rebounding (10.7) versus the Lakers, including an impressive outing in the series&#x27;s sixth game, scoring 32 points and grabbing 16 rebounds in defeat.

=== As a full-time starter, the &quot;Torture Chamber&quot; (1985–1988) ===

The 1985–1986 edition of the Boston Celtics won the franchise&#x27;s 16th NBA championship and is considered one of the greatest teams in NBA history.

The Celtics acquired former NBA Most Valuable Player Bill Walton in a trade from the Los Angeles Clippers in September 1985, and added the 6 ft 11 in (211 cm) center to its already-formidable frontline. Boston sent Cedric Maxwell to the Clippers to complete the trade, clearing the way for McHale to move into a full-time starting role. McHale averaged better than 20 points per game for the first time in his career (21.3) and finished 13th in the NBA Most Valuable Player voting.

He joined starters Bird, Parish, Johnson and Danny Ainge as the Celtics steamrolled the NBA with a league-best 67–15 record. The team set a then-NBA record by finishing with an 82–18 win–loss record (including playoffs), breaking the record of 81 victories by the 1971–72 Lakers.

Boston also set the NBA mark for most home victories in one season, finishing 50–1 (including playoffs) in 48 games in the Boston Garden and three games in Hartford, Connecticut. The Portland Trail Blazers were the only team to beat Boston at home, winning 121–103 in Boston Garden on December 6, 1985. The Celtics did not lose again at home until more than a year later, when the Lakers beat them 117–110 on December 12, 1986.

Boston won 41 of its first 50 games, including two victories over the Lakers. In a rout of the Clippers on December 30, 1985, McHale set his single-game high in rebounds with 18 (a mark he tied against the Pistons in 1989).

An extremely durable player through the first five seasons of his career, McHale missed 14 games in early 1986 due to an injured Achilles tendon in his left ankle, but was healthy in time for the playoffs. Boston rolled through the Eastern Conference, winning 11 of 12 games versus Chicago, Atlanta and Milwaukee.

For the second time in five years, the Celtics faced Houston in the NBA Finals, and Boston won the championship in six games. McHale averaged 25.8 points per game in the finals to lead all scorers.

By his seventh pro season, McHale had rehearsed and refined his low-post moves and had become one of the NBA&#x27;s most dominant offensive forces, out-leaping, out-spinning and outmaneuvering defender after defender in his &quot;torture chamber&quot;. McHale was never better than in the 1986–1987 season, setting career highs in scoring (26.1) and rebounding (9.9). He also became the first player in NBA history to shoot 60 percent or better from the field (60.4%) and 80 percent or better from the free-throw line (83.6%) in the same season. McHale was named to the All-NBA First Team, was named the NBA&#x27;s best defensive player by the league&#x27;s coaches, and finished fourth in the Most Valuable Player voting behind Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and teammate Larry Bird.

In nine games from February 23 through March 13, 1987, McHale averaged 30.7 points and 10 rebounds per game while shooting 71.7 percent from the floor. During this stretch, McHale scored his season-high in points, 38 versus the Pistons on March 1.

In a win at Chicago on March 27, McHale broke the navicular bone in his right foot. He ignored doctors&#x27; advice that the injury could be career-threatening and continued to play. In the playoffs, a hobbled McHale averaged 39 minutes per game and connected on 58 percent of his shots as Boston again won the Eastern Conference title. Boston swept the Bulls in the first round for the second straight year and survived two epic but bruising seven-game series with the Bucks and Pistons. The battered and fatigued Celtics - with not only McHale, but also Parish (two sprained ankles), Ainge (leg injury) and Walton (broken foot) playing hurt - then lost to the Lakers in six games in the 1987 NBA Finals.

Off-season surgery on his injured right foot and ankle forced McHale to sit out the first month of the 1987–1988 season. He scored 22 points in 22 minutes of play in his return to the Celtics on December 1, 1987, versus Atlanta.

Teammate Danny Ainge once called McHale &quot;The Black Hole of the low post&quot;, joking that when the basketball was passed inside to McHale it disappeared because he rarely passed it back out to the perimeter. But in a win over the Dallas Mavericks on April 3, 1988, McHale played the role of passer, distributing a career-high 10 assists.

The Celtics won 57 games and made their fifth straight appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. McHale shot 60% from the field and averaged a career playoff-high 25.4 points per game as Boston defeated the Knicks in four games and the Hawks in a seven-game semi-final series. He averaged 26.8 points per game and shot 56.3% from the field, including a game-tying three-point shot in overtime of game two, but Boston fell to the Detroit Pistons in six games in the conference final. Head coach K. C. Jones retired at season&#x27;s end, and the Celtics of the Bird-McHale-Parish era would never again advance past the conference semi-finals.

=== Injury and decline (1988–1993) ===
Injuries limited Bird to six games in 1988–89 and the Celtics slipped to 42–40. New head coach Jimmy Rodgers coaxed the team into the playoffs as the Eastern Conference&#x27;s eighth and final seed behind the play of McHale, Parish and second-year guard Reggie Lewis.

The Celtics - without the injured Bird - faced the Pistons in the playoffs for the third straight year. Detroit held McHale to 19 points per game and less than 50 percent shooting from the field. The Pistons swept the Celtics en route to their first NBA championship.

The 1989–90 season marked the last time McHale was healthy enough to play in all 82 regular-season games for the Celtics, but the season was one of discontent for Boston. Second-year point guard Brian Shaw left the team to play in Europe after a salary dispute. Bird returned to the court following his various injuries but was criticized by teammates, including McHale, for taking too many shots and trying to dominate games on his own.

Rodgers moved McHale back into his old &quot;sixth man&quot; role for the majority of the regular season, with Ed Pinckney taking McHale&#x27;s spot in the starting lineup; McHale&#x27;s scoring slipped back into the teens coming off the bench. With the Celtics 34–25, Rodgers decided to put McHale into the starting lineup once again. McHale averaged 24.2 points and 9 rebounds down the stretch as the Celtics went 18–5 and finished one game behind Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division.

McHale became the first player in 20 years to finish in the NBA&#x27;s top ten in field goal percentage (seventh) and free throw percentage (fifth) in the same season.

Boston took the first two games of its first-round playoff series with the Knicks, including a record-setting 157–128 score in Game 2. The Knicks fought back and won the last three games of the series. Head coach Jimmy Rodgers was fired following the playoff disappointment.

McHale contemplated retirement in the off-season after having another surgery performed on his right ankle, but came back for the 1990–91 season. Boston paired young backcourt players Lewis, Dee Brown, Kevin Gamble and Brian Shaw—back from his year in Europe—with Bird, McHale and Parish and hired Chris Ford, a longtime assistant coach and member of the Celtics&#x27; 1981 championship team, to be the team&#x27;s head coach.

Boston jumped out to a 29–5 record, but were soon slowed by injuries to McHale (ankle) and Bird (back). McHale missed 14 regular-season games and Bird missed 22, as the Celtics limped to a 27–21 record over the last three months of the season. The team&#x27;s 56–26 record was still good enough to win the division title. Boston defeated the Indiana Pacers in five games in a first-round playoff matchup. Detroit defeated Boston for the third time in four years, this time in a six-game semi-final series.

McHale played in a career-low 56 games and Bird played in just 45 in 1991–92 season. Boston struggled for most of the regular season but got hot as the playoffs approached, winning 15 of its last 16 games and finishing with 51 wins and a tie for first place in the division with the New York Knicks. Boston had the tie-breaker to give them another Atlantic Division crown; their record was the third-best in the Eastern Conference.

The Celtics swept the Pacers in the first round but were defeated in seven games in the conference semi-finals by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Bird retired from the NBA three months later.

The 1992–93 season was McHale&#x27;s last in the NBA. McHale played in 71 games, but he was severely hampered by leg and back injuries. He averaged 10.7 points per game and shot less than 50 percent from the floor (45.9%) for the only time in his career. McHale briefly feuded with coach and best friend Chris Ford over his lack of playing time near the end of his final season.

In the first round of the NBA playoffs against the Charlotte Hornets the Celtics were stunned by the loss of Lewis, their leading scorer, who collapsed on the court during Game 1 and was diagnosed with what eventually proved to be a fatal heart condition. McHale performed brilliantly in the series. He averaged 19.6 points per game and shot 58 percent from the field—including a reminiscent performance of 30 points and 10 rebounds in Game 2—but Boston fell to the Hornets in four games.

McHale announced his retirement while talking with reporters at the scorer&#x27;s table after the Game 4 loss in Charlotte.

===Legacy===
McHale was a part of what many consider the league&#x27;s best-ever frontline with small forward Larry Bird and center Robert Parish. The trio of Hall of Famers became known as the &quot;Big Three&quot; and led the Celtics to five NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships, in 1981, 1984 and 1986. For the first five years of his career McHale primarily came off the bench for the Celtics, winning the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1984 and 1985.

Possessing a wide variety of offensive moves close to the basket the agile, long-armed McHale played in seven National Basketball Association All-Star Games between 1984 and 1991. McHale&#x27;s finest season came in 1986–87 when he was named to the All-NBA First Team as a forward. He led the NBA in field goal percentage in the 1986-87 and 1987-88 seasons, shooting 60.4 percent each season. Also a standout defensive player, McHale was selected to the NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team six times. He twice blocked nine shots in a game, the most ever by a Boston Celtics player (blocked shots did not become an official NBA statistic until the 1973-74 season).

Fellow NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said of McHale, &quot;Kevin McHale&#x27;s the best player I played against because he was unstoppable offensively, and he gave me nightmares on defense.&quot;

In 971 regular season games McHale averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds and in 169 post-season games averaged 18.8 points and 7.4 rebounds.

At the end of the 2007–2008 season McHale ranked tenth in NBA history in career field goal percentage (55.4%), and he is among the Celtics&#x27; career leaders in several categories, including games played, points scored and rebounding.

McHale&#x27;s number 32 jersey was retired by the Celtics on January 30, 1994, during a halftime ceremony at the Boston Garden.

He was chosen one of the NBA&#x27;s 50 greatest players and was named to the NBA&#x27;s 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996.

In 1992, McHale was elected to the Minnesota State High School League Hall of Fame. He was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999.

In 2021, McHale was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Team. To commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named McHale as the 49th greatest player in NBA history.

In October 2022, he was inaugurated in the Croatian-American Sports Hall of Fame.

==Career after retirement==

===Front office work with Minnesota Timberwolves===
Upon his retirement as an NBA player, McHale joined the Minnesota Timberwolves as a television analyst and &quot;special assistant&quot;. In the summer of 1994, new Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor promoted him to Assistant General Manager, although he continued to broadcast Timberwolves games as well. In 1995, he was promoted to Vice President of Basketball Operations (i.e., General Manager); one of his first acts was hiring former University of Minnesota teammate Flip Saunders as head coach of the Timberwolves.

The next season, McHale decided to select high school forward Kevin Garnett with the fifth overall pick of the 1995 NBA draft. Though Garnett developed into one of the NBA&#x27;s best players, the Timberwolves advanced past the first round of the playoffs only once in Garnett&#x27;s 12 seasons with the team.

It was also during McHale&#x27;s reign that the Timberwolves were punished by the NBA for making a secret deal with free-agent forward Joe Smith to circumvent the league&#x27;s salary cap rules. Before the 1998–99 season, Smith secretly agreed to sign three, one-year contracts with the Timberwolves for salary amounts that were much less than what any other NBA teams would have reasonably offered him. In return, Smith received a promise that the Timberwolves would give him a multi-year, multimillion-dollar contract before the 2001–02 season.

In 2000, after word of the agreement leaked, NBA commissioner David Stern voided Smith&#x27;s final one-year contract with the Timberwolves, making Smith a free agent. Stern also stripped three of the Timberwolves&#x27; next five first-round draft picks from the team, and fined the team $3.5 million. In addition, McHale served a suspension that lasted through July 2001. Smith signed with the Detroit Pistons for one season, but returned to Minnesota before the 2001–2002 season as a free agent.

On February 12, 2005, the Timberwolves fired Saunders and McHale took over as head coach for the rest of the 2004–05 season. He compiled a 19–12 record, but had no interest in continuing as head coach at the time. Dwane Casey was hired as the new head coach in the off-season.

With Minnesota sitting at .500 midway through the 2006–07 season, McHale fired Casey on January 23, 2007. Timberwolves&#x27; assistant coach Randy Wittman was tapped to succeed Casey. Despite missing the playoffs, on April 19, 2007, the Timberwolves announced that McHale and Wittman would return for the 2007–08 season. 

Prior to the 2007 NBA draft, McHale reportedly tried to work out a trade with Boston Celtics General Manager (and former Celtics teammate) Danny Ainge to trade franchise star Kevin Garnett (frequently named, at the time, the best active player to have never won an NBA championship) to Boston, in exchange for a draft pick and multiple players. Garnett&#x27;s agent told the Timberwolves and the Celtics that his client had no interest in playing for Boston. (Although Boston had a legitimate star in Paul Pierce, and some solid young players, the team was coming off a 24-win season, and Garnett was not interested in going from one mediocre team to another.) The potential trade was scuttled, for the time being. However, in late June the Celtics swung a draft-day deal with the Seattle SuperSonics to acquire sharpshooter and seven-time All-Star Ray Allen. So in late July 2007, when the Timberwolves and the Celtics once again discussed a deal involving Garnett, the prospect of playing alongside both Pierce and Allen caused Garnett to ease his stance on being dealt to Boston; on July 31 he was sent to the Celtics for five players and two first-round draft picks, and the Celtics instantly became viewed as contenders. The very next season, Garnett would go on to help the Celtics win the NBA championship, was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and finished third in the voting for the regular-season version of the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. (Although one of McHale&#x27;s key acquisitions in the trade - promising power-forward Al Jefferson - would come very close to matching Garnett&#x27;s statistics from the previous year, and Ryan Gomes (another player acquired in the trade) performed well, the rebuilding team won 10 fewer games its first season without Garnett.) The Timberwolves eventually fired McHale by the end of the 2008–09 season.

===Coaching===

On December 8, 2008, the Timberwolves fired Wittman. He had compiled a 38–105 record since taking over for Casey. The Timberwolves announced that McHale would step down as VP of Basketball Operations and once again take over the head coaching job, this time more permanently; the Timberwolves&#x27; owner Glen Taylor at the time indicated that he was not seeking to replace McHale as head coach. On June 17, 2009, however, it was announced that McHale would not return as the Timberwolves&#x27; head coach for the 2009–2010 season, and he was later replaced by Kurt Rambis, whom McHale infamously clotheslined in Game 4 of the 1984 NBA Finals.

On June 1, 2011, McHale was named head coach of the Houston Rockets, replacing Rick Adelman. On December 24, 2014, McHale signed a three-year contract extension to remain head coach of the Rockets. He led the Rockets to the Western Conference finals in 2015. However, he was fired on November 18, 2015, after four consecutive losses and a 4–7 start to the 2015–16 season.

McHale is one of six members of the 1985–86 Celtics&#x27; championship team to have served as an NBA head coach (Larry Bird, Danny Ainge, Dennis Johnson, Sam Vincent and Rick Carlisle are the others).

===TV analyst===
Immediately upon retiring, McHale became the color analyst for Minnesota Timberwolves games for two seasons, from 1993 to 1995. McHale began working for TNT and NBA TV as an on-air, floor-side analyst during the 2009–2010 regular season. He occasionally appeared on the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot; in-studio show, and even broadcast a few regular season and playoff games for the cable station. During the 2016 NBA Playoffs, McHale served as a guest analyst for the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot;″s coverage. On October 10, 2016, he signed a multi-year agreement to return to Turner Sports.

McHale was also a part of the studio team for NBA TV&#x27;s Fan Night broadcasts on Tuesday nights during the season (along with Ernie Johnson, Chris Webber and Greg Anthony since the 2016–17 season). McHale also called games for the station during the 2010 Las Vegas Summer League.

==Personal life==
On June 26, 1982, McHale married his wife Lynn. They had five children: Kristyn, Michael, Joseph, Alexandra, and Thomas. On November 24, 2012, Alexandra died at age 23, after being hospitalized for lupus for 14 days.

McHale guest-starred as himself in two episodes of the TV series &quot;Cheers&quot;: &quot;Cheers Fouls Out&quot; (season 9, episode 2) in 1990 and &quot;Where Have All the Floorboards Gone&quot; (season 10, episode 8) in 1991. The latter episode also featured Lynn McHale.

<text>Jiangling () is a county in southern Hubei province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. Administratively, it is under the jurisdiction of Jingzhou City.

==History==
The county name derived from the old name of Jingzhou.
Liang Dynasty Prince Xiao Yi (蕭繹; 507–555) was made governor of Jingzhou, of which Jiangling was the provincial capital, at about the time that scholar and writer Yan Zhitui (531–590s) was born there. After defeating the Hou Jing Rebellion, Xiao Yi took the Liang throne, but instead of moving back to the imperial capital at Jiankang (Nanjing), he settled in Jiangling -- although his courtiers had advised otherwise. In 553, he allied with the Western Wei regime to attack his own younger brother, Xiao Ji (蕭紀; 508–553), who had used his own position as governor in Sichuan to declare himself emperor. Unfortunately for the Liang Dynasty as a whole, this enabled Western Wei to take the Shu area (Sichuan) and then turn against Xiao Yi, attacking Jiangling in 554 and conquering the city with great brutality. 

In 1994, Jiangling County was dissolved and converted to two districts (Jingzhou and Jiangling) of Jingzhou City. The current Jiangling County was established in 1998, when the Jiangling District, then covering 11 outlying towns and townships, was again reverted to county status.

==Administrative divisions==
Six towns:
*Zishi (), Xionghe (), Baimasi (), Shagang (), Puji (), Haoxue ()

Two townships:
*Majiazhai Township (), Qinshi Township ()

Three other areas:
*Jiangbei (), Sanhu (), Lu/Liuheyuan ()

<text>The Hellanodikai (, literally meaning &quot;Judges of the Greeks&quot;; sing. Ἑλλανοδίκας ) were the judges of the Ancient Olympic Games, and the success of the games was attributed to their efforts. It was their sacred duty to maintain the standards and legacy of the games, as well as uphold the rules. 

== History ==
One &quot;Hellanodikas&quot; was a type of Greek public official termed generally the agonothetes (English transliteration), , &quot;Agōnothetai&quot;, meaning &quot;game organisers&quot;), magistrates chosen specifically for the purpose of establishing and maintaining public games. The method of selection depended on the type of government of the founding state. Different states might give particular names to the agonothetes of particular games; for example, the agonothetes of the Pythian games at Athens were called athlothetes. As Athens was a democracy, they were democratically elected. The origin of the agonothetes of the Olympic games is lost in prehistory. The legendary Hercules, founder of the games in Doric legend, would have been the first legendary agonothete. However that may be, the agonothetes of the historical Olympic games were the Hellanodikai. Originally, perhaps, if only in legend, there may have been only one &quot;Hellanodikas&quot;, but this expanded, reaching as high as twelve members and then settling on ten in 348 BC. They supervised individual events, with a senior &quot;Hellanodikas&quot; as an overseer.

== Selection and Training ==
&quot;Hellanodikai&quot; were handpicked from people living in the region of Elis, as Elis was responsible for the running of the Olympics. Originally the post was hereditary, but this was changed, and an Elean from each of the ruling families were elected as a &quot;Hellanodikas&quot;. Their post only lasted for one Olympiad, and elections took place for each of the subsequent games.

In the ten months preceding the games, the &quot;Hellanodikai&quot; lived in a specially made building in Elis, called the &quot;Hellanodikaion&quot;. This building was close to the gymnasiums where the athletes trained in preparation for the games. While staying at the &quot;Hellanodikaion&quot;, they were trained by the &quot;nomophylakes&quot; (νομοφύλακες, meaning &#x27;guardians of the law&#x27;) in the rules and regulations of the olympic games.

== Function ==

=== Judgement ===
The &quot;Hellanodikai&quot; were renowned for their fairness, and the public held them in high regard. While bribery and cheating among the athletes was commonplace, there was only one recorded case of corruption among the judges, where a &quot;Hellanodikas&quot; won two equestrian events. To remain impartial, the &quot;Hellanodikai&quot; were no longer allowed to participate in the games, and this remained the only blemish on their otherwise impeccable record.

Another task for the &quot;Hellanodikai&quot; was to supervise the training of the athletes, where they selected those who were well trained, rejecting those who were not performing at a satisfactory level. The trainers for the individual athletes had to be present, but could not intervene or they were punished accordingly. They evaluated each athlete on behaviour, character and morality, as well as the more standard attributes such as power, stamina, and resistance. Those that were approved were entered into a special list called the &quot;leukoma&quot; (λεύκωμα).

=== Ritual ===
Besides being judges and umpires, the &quot;Hellanodikai&quot; also were the general organisers, and were present at every ceremony and event that took place, having the honour of presenting the crowns and palm branches to the winners. They were also expected to police the games.

Two days before the games, the athletes who were eligible left Elis for Olympia, in a procession led by the Hellanodikai.

<text>Talking trees are a form of sapient trees in mythologies and stories.

Ben Bryne initially said that in Greek mythology, all the trees in the Dodona (northwestern Greece, Epirus) grove (the forest beside the sanctuary of Zeus) became endowed with the gift of prophecy, and the oaks not only spoke and delivered oracles while in a living state, but when built into the ship &quot;Argo&quot; the wood spoke and warned of approaching calamities.

==Examples==
* In the book &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (Book of Kings) by Firdawsi (d. 1020), Alexander the Great visited a talking tree.
* The rustling of the leaves on an oak tree has been regarded as the voice of Zeus.
* The Greek talking elm: Philostratus spoke about two philosophers arguing beneath an elm tree in Ethiopia which spoke up to add to the conversation.
* The Indian Tree of the Sun and the Moon told the future. Two parts of the tree trunk spoke depending on the time of day; in the daytime the tree spoke as a male and at night it spoke as a female. Marco Polo is said to have visited this tree.
* The weeping date palm tree: Muhammad, when delivering his sermons, used to stand by or lean on a date palm tree. When a pulpit was built elsewhere and Muhammad started to give his sermon from the pulpit, the tree began to cry like a child. Muhammad then descended from his pulpit and consoled the tree by embracing it and stroking it. He said, &quot;It was crying for (missing) what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it.&quot; This incident is recorded in the authentic Islamic Hadith traditions and is said to have been witnessed by everyone present at the congregation.
* Oracular trees are sometimes attributed with the ability to speak to individuals, especially those gifted in divination. In particular, Druids were said to be able to consult oak trees for divinatory purposes, as were the Streghe with Rowan trees.
* In Medieval literature, in the Arthurian legend, Merlin is turned into a tree by Viviane.
* In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; story &quot;Inferno&quot;, the protagonists (Dante and Virgil) speak with suicides who have been turned into trees in Hell.
* In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Ents are a species of sentient beings who closely resemble trees, who serves as ancient shepherds of the forest and allies of the free peoples of Middle-earth during the War of the Ring.
* In English folklore, willows were said to stalk humans.
* The Yaqui have a legend of a talking tree. The tree told of the Christian God and the priests who would soon arrive to teach the people new beliefs and new ways.
* Artist Théodore Rousseau (1812–1867) is quoted as saying &quot;I also heard the voices of the trees ... whose passions I uncovered. I wanted to talk with them ... and put my finger on the secret of their majesty.&quot;

<doc id="1146059" wikidata="Q8519475" url="?curid=1146059" title="Crinkle Crags">
<text>Crinkle Crags is a fell in the English Lake District in the county of Cumbria. It forms part of two major rings of mountains, surrounding the valleys of Great Langdale and Upper Eskdale. The name reflects the fell&#x27;s physical appearance as its summit ridge is a series of five rises and depressions (crinkles) that are very distinctive from the valley floor. In Old English, &quot;cringol&quot; means twisted or wrinkled.

==Topography==

The nomenclature of the various tops is very confused. Traditional guidebooks tend to rely on what the eye sees and therefore focus attention upon the five ‘crinkles’ of the summit ridge. These are generally referred to as the first to fifth crinkles, but Richards starts in the north, Birkett in the south and Wainwright employs both conventions, depending upon the direction of travel. For clarity in this article the first crinkle will be taken as the southernmost top. On this basis, the second Crinkle (also called Long Top) is the true summit of the fell. The only other Crinkle with a definitive name is Gunson Knott, but this name is used variously for the third and the fifth, with both the Ordnance Survey and the Database of British and Irish Hills listing it twice. To the north of the Crinkles proper is a depression and then the outcropping continues over Shelter Crags.

In recent times more systematic hill lists have been produced based upon topographical prominence and height, rather than mere visual appeal. Most relevant to Crinkle Crags are the lists of Hewitts and Nuttalls. These variously list the summit, the first Crinkle (Crinkle Crags South Top), and two tops on Shelter Crags (Shelter Crags and Shelter Crags North Top), but exclude the other three Crinkles, although the third (sometimes named Gunson Knott), fourth and fifth (also sometimes named Gunson Knott) are all Birketts.

The ridge of Crinkle Crags extends due south from its higher neighbour, Bowfell. Between the two is the col of Three Tarns, named for the small pools in the depression. Depending upon recent rainfall there may be anything from two to five tarns in evidence on the ground. From here the rocky outcropping of Shelter Crags is quickly reached.

Beyond the summit to the south, the ridge descends over Stonesty Pike (a Birkett) and Little Stand (a Nuttall and a Fellranger) to the Duddon Valley at Cockley Beck. Two further ridges branch out from Crinkle Crags on either side of the summit, before turning south to run parallel to Little Stand. On the west, across the marshy trench of Moasdale is Hard Knott. To the east an initially indistinct ridge firms up on the traverse to Cold Pike. Between Cold Pike and Crinkle Crags, but generally included as part of the latter is the further Nuttall of Great Knott.

==Ascents==

In his &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot;, Alfred Wainwright describes Crinkle Crags as

:&quot;Much too good to be missed ... this is a climb deserving of high priority.&quot;
There are a variety of routes directly to the summit: most people climb the fell from Great Langdale and usually together with all or some of the adjoining fells of Bowfell, Pike of Blisco, Rossett Pike and Cold Pike to make a high-level ridge walk which encompasses the whole of the high ground at the head of Great Langdale. The ascent from Eskdale is very good, but that is at least a round trip (depending on where in Eskdale one starts), and many people will think that this too far to &quot;bag&quot; just one fell. The shortest and quickest route requires the use of a car to the top of the Wrynose Pass motor road.

==Summit==
The traverse of the summit ridge with its series of undulations is an exhilarating experience for the fell walker. The ridge includes the so-called &quot;Bad Step&quot;, a steep declivity which catches out many walkers when travelling from north to south; however, the obstacle can be by-passed without too much trouble.

The view from the summit is very good: there are airy views of Great Langdale, Eskdale and Dunnerdale, with the estuaries of the rivers Duddon and Esk well seen as they enter the Irish Sea. There is a very good view of England&#x27;s highest mountain, Scafell Pike, which lies just four kilometres ( miles) away to the north west. Shelter Crags gives extensive all-round views.

Panorama

== Protected Area ==
Crinkle Crags are within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called &quot;Ray and Crinkle Crags&quot;. This 146 hectare site was designated in 1988 because of the important geology present that reveals volcanic activity that occurred here in the late Ordovician period. 

This protected area includes Crinkle Crags South Top and Gunson Knott.

=== Details of SSSI status ===
The volcanic rocks of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group at Crinkle Crags record the cyclic history of eruptions and caldera collapse that occurred within the Scafel Caldera. Rock types present include tuffs and ignimbrite. West of Crinkle Crags, basalt lava has been recorded. This site is exceptional because it shows the range of deposits formed by the explosive disintegration of magma by water (most calderas of this type are inaccessible because they are flooded or buried by their erupted products). The geology here has been interpreted as showing how volcanic eruptions led to faults changing and growing. 

=== Land ownership in this SSSI ===
Crinkle Crags are aligned on the boundary between Eskdale and Westmorland and Furness. Part of the land within &quot;Ray and Crinkle Crags SSSI&quot; that is on the western Eskdale side is owned by the National Trust.

<doc id="1146065" wikidata="Q604695" url="?curid=1146065" title="Voodoo Glow Skulls">
<text>Voodoo Glow Skulls are an American ska punk band formed in 1988 in Riverside, California, by brothers Frank, Eddie, and Jorge Casillas and their longtime friend Jerry O&#x27;Neill. Voodoo Glow Skulls first played at backyard parties and later at Spanky&#x27;s Café in their hometown of Riverside, where they played shows with the Angry Samoans, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Firehose, Murphy&#x27;s Law, and The Dickies.

== History ==
Their first recording was in 1989a four-song demo on a four-track machine which they duplicated onto about sixty cassettes on a home stereo then sold at shows.

In 1990, Voodoo Glow Skulls released their first 7-inch EP &quot;The Old of Tomorrow&quot;, a parody title inspired by the straight edge band named Youth of Today, with the help of local band Public Humiliation, and also booked their own DIY US tour.

In 1991, the band added a horn section to their live shows and recordings, due mostly to the influence of two of their favorite bands at the time, Fishbone and Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band&#x27;s second independent release came out in 1992 with the &quot;Rasta Mis Huevos&quot; 7-inch EP for Signal Sound Systems Records. This label also released a glow-in-the-dark 12-inch EP titled &quot;We&#x27;re Coloring Fun&quot; and the first release of &quot;The Potty Training Years&quot; on CD.

Voodoo Glow Skulls recorded their debut album &quot;Who Is, This Is?&quot; for Dr. Strange Records in 1993, gaining the attention of Brett Gurewitz, owner of Epitaph Records.The band then signed to Epitaph Records and released a further four albums. The band began to tour worldwide with their first European tour in 1996 followed by Japan, Australia, Mexico, and South America.

The band has been featured on several of Epitaph&#x27;s &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot; releases and has had music featured in video games, television and movies.

The song &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; from the band&#x27;s &quot;Firme&quot; album was used in the Pauly Shore movie &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; and the band&#x27;s version of &quot;Used to Love Her&quot; (originally written and recorded by Guns N&#x27; Roses) is featured in the &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; soundtrack.

In 2002, Voodoo Glow Skulls signed to Victory Records. The band released three albums on the Victory label and continued to tour.

On January 18, 2012, the band released its self-produced ninth album, &quot;Break the Spell&quot;, through Smelvis Records.

The band contributed a song to the 2015 Rancid tribute compilation &quot;Hooligans United&quot;.

The band appeared as musical guests during the second season of &quot;Lucha Underground&quot; in 2016.

On June 3, 2017, Frank Casillas announced he was quitting Voodoo Glow Skulls, live on stage during a show at Alex&#x27;s Bar in Long Beach, CA. The band has continued playing with Efrem Schulz from Death by Stereo on vocals. In 2021, the band released &quot;Livin&#x27; the Apocalypse&quot;, their first release with Efrem Schulz on lead vocals. The band is currently working on more new material and still tours frequently. In September 2024, Efrem Schulz announced he was no longer a member of the band via his personal Instagram page. On September 30, Eddie and Jorge Casillas announced that Frank had rejoined the band and would join them for their October 5 performance at the Regent Theater in Los Angeles.

==Ancient walls==

The ancient walls that surrounds Montagnana were built in the eleventh century to protect the town. It is a 2 km long wall with a height that varies between 6.5 and 8 meters. The current walls, which represent one of the most distinguished and best preserved examples of medieval military architecture in Europe, except the complex of Castel San Zeno and the parts of the walls to the east and west that are older, date back to the middle of the 14th century, when the Carraresi, lords of Padua, wanted to enlarge and strengthen this essential frontier fort of the Paduan state against the Verona of the Scaligeri, which dominated the nearby Legnago. The urban space intramoenia was expanded on that occasion, and the new enclosure was built with superimposed layers of bricks and stones (trachyte transported by water from the nearby Euganean hills). The fortified city is enclosed in an irregular quadrilateral of about 600x300 metres with an area of 24 hectares and a perimeter of about two kilometres. The walls, crowned by Guelph-type battlements, are 6.5 to 8 metres high, with a thickness of 96–100 cm. Between one battlement and another, wooden fans served to shelter the defenders. The perimeter towers, a total of 24, spaced of about 60 meters, are between 17 and 19 metres high. The external valley varies from 30 to 40 metres.

The warehouses (canipe) were located inside the barrel-vaults that support the patrol path, in order to keep the goods produced in the countryside (we can still see the grooves to attach the wooden reinforcements). In the towers, with several floors and covered by a sloping roof hidden under the pitch equipped with siege engines, there were other warehouses and quarters for soldiers placed as a garrison of the fortress in times of war emergency. An area without buildings and used as a cultivated pomerium to face long sieges was all around the walls from the inside.

Around the walls ran a large moat (the current picturesque and green Vallo) flooded with the water of the river Frassine (border towards the Vicenza area) derived by means of a canal with raised embankments (the Fiumicello) as a defensive canal along which, on the Paduan side, there was an elevated outpost for the buildup of troops. All around the Montagnana area there were impassable swamps or floodable plains in case of war, so that the walled city was the key to the Paduan frontier to the west. The military structure was also encircled by four advanced perimeter fortifications (the bastions), now disappeared, and the two fortresses placed to defend the two gates were surrounded by a moat on the city side as well. The fortress, in its time, was impregnable and, in fact, until the advent of howitzers (16th century), it was never captured militarily.

Access to the city was controlled by the fortified gates of the castle of San Zeno (to the east, towards Padua) and the Rocca degli Alberi (to the west, towards the Veronese area). Only later, in the 16th century, a third door (Porta Nova or Porta di Vicenza) was opened in the north to facilitate communication with the river port of Frassine. At the end of the 19th century a fourth passage was made towards the south, for access to the railway station (Porta XX Settembre).

The medieval walls of Montagnana have been included among the I Luoghi del Cuore, an initiative promoted by the FAI.

==Rocca degli Alberi==
The Rocca degli Alberi, which stands imposing and scenic on the valley from the west, was built by the Carraresi family in the biennium 1360-62 with exclusively military function. The fortified entrance consisted of a complex defensive system: along the entrance hall, dominated by two towers, there were four swing doors, two shutters and four drawbridges. A similar system was in Castel San Zeno.

Since 1963 the fortress contained the youth hostel, now moved to a structure a few meters outside the walls, and it can be visited in the period April–October.

==Castle of San Zeno==
The castle of San Zeno (whose name derives from the nearby San Zeno church, recalls a phase of expansion of the veronese diocese) stands in the place of a high-medieval settlement that was the residence of the heirs of Hugh the Great of Tuscany who later became the marquises of Este. Today’s construction (except for the Venetian room and the Austrian superstructures) dates back to the 13th century, when Ezzelino III da Romano, after having set it on fire in 1242, wanted to fortify Montagnana better.

The building has a rectangular plan (46x26 metres) with a large internal courtyard. Until the early 19th century, the castle was surrounded by a moat that also isolated it from the city side. The structure was completed by towers (of which two remain) and the nearby lookout tower (about 40 metres high) which had to be a privileged point for sighting and defense of the city. Initially, the drawbridge that crossed the valley allowing access to the city, probably led to the inner courtyard of the castle. It is assumed that the passage was then moved to the south side of the castle itself, protected by both this and the high lookout tower. The latter was originally supposed to be lower and covered by a wooden roof surmounted by a guardhouse.

==Palio dei 10 Comuni==
The Palio dei 10 Comuni del Montagnanese, commonly called &quot;Palio di Montagnana&quot; because it takes place in the town of Montagnana, is a commemorating event in memory of the liberation from the tragic tyranny of Ezzelino III da Romano. Since 1977 it is held annually on the first Sunday of September renewing an ancient medieval tradition. The race includes two qualifiers and a final, on horses rode bareback by jockeys. The Oath of the Captains is the event that starts the Palio and until 2018 was held about a week before but in 2019 was held on the Thursday before the Palio Race. In conjunction with the race, Montagnana is immersed in the medieval atmosphere with several activities: the Historical Parade through the city streets, the Tenzone (a competition) of archers, musicians and flag wavers, the Gonfalons race in addition to the suggestive Burning of the Fortress that is generally held the night before the race.

==Culture==
Two of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest operatic tenors, Giovanni Martinelli and Aureliano Pertile, were both born in the town in 1885.

==Food and cuisine==
Montagnana is famous for its prosciutto. In mid May, the city organises a festival with conferences and tastings that attracts thousands of visitors.

<text>USS &quot;Carp&quot; (SS/AGSS/IXSS-338), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the carp.

==Construction and active service==

&quot;Carp&quot; (SS-338) was launched 12 November 1944 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. W. E. Hess; and commissioned 28 February 1945.

&quot;Carp&quot; departed New London 14 April 1945, conducted training at Balboa, Panama, and arrived at Pearl Harbor 21 May. On her first and only war patrol (8 June – 7 August), &quot;Carp&quot; cruised off the coast of Honshū, destroying small craft and patrolling for the carriers of the 3rd Fleet engaged in air strikes on the mainland. Undergoing refit at Midway when hostilities ended, &quot;Carp&quot; returned to Seattle 22 September.

&quot;Carp&quot; received one battle star for her service in World War II. Her single war patrol was designated as &quot;successful&quot;.

Based in San Diego as flagship for Submarine Division 71, &quot;Carp&quot; operated along the West Coast with occasional training cruises to Pearl Harbor. Between 13 February and 15 June 1947 she made a simulated war patrol to the Far East, and in 1948 and 1949 &quot;Carp&quot; made two exploratory cruises to extreme northern waters, adding to the knowledge of an increasingly important strategic area for submarine operations.

Converted to a Fleet Snorkel-type submarine in February 1952, which added to her submerged speed and endurance, &quot;Carp&quot; supported United Nations&#x27; forces in the Korean War during her cruise of 22 September 1952–April 1953 to the Far East. Arriving at Pearl Harbor, her new home port 15 March 1954, &quot;Carp&quot; remained on active duty with the fleet from that port through July 1959. During this time she continued to make cruises to the Far East, one of which included a good-will visit to Australia and participation in a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization exercise, and to Alaskan waters.

On 1 August 1959 &quot;Carp&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her new assignment with the Atlantic Fleet. Arriving at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia, 28 August 1959, the submarine conducted type exercises and training off the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea through 1967.

==Auxiliary and training service==

&quot;Carp&quot; was redesignated an Auxiliary Submarine, AGSS-338, in 1968, and Miscellaneous Submarine IXSS-338 in 1971.

Around 1971, &quot;Carp&quot; was moored at South Boston Naval Annex, across the harbor from Logan International Airport at about the point where Interstate 90 now crosses. She was used for training. Her battery room was converted into a television lounge, and her rudder was welded in place; otherwise, &quot;Carp&quot; seemed fully operational to trainees.

==Fate==
&quot;Carp&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 December 1971 and sold for scrapping in 1973. Her conning tower has been preserved at Seawolf Park on Pelican Island just north of Galveston, Texas.

<text>The Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead or flathead Ford) is a V8 engine with a flat cylinder head introduced by the Ford Motor Company in 1932 and built by Ford through 1953. During the engine&#x27;s first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were used by only a small minority of makes, it was usually known simply as the Ford V‑8, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the &quot;Ford V-8&quot; after its new engine. An automotive milestone as the first affordable V8, it ranks as one of the company&#x27;s most important developments. The engine was intended to be used for big passenger cars and trucks; it was installed in such (with minor, incremental changes) until 1953, making the engine&#x27;s 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine. It was also built independently by Ford licensees.. The engine was named on Ward&#x27;s list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century. It was a staple of hot rodders in the 1950s, and it remains famous in the classic car hobbies even today, despite the huge variety of other popular V8s that followed.

==Development and production==
Ford had helped pioneer the concept of an affordable mass-produced car. Historically , these used inline-four and inline-six cylinder engines. Following French engineer Léon Levavasseur&#x27;s invention of the V8 in 1902, V8s, V12s, and even V16s, were produced for use in luxury models. The Cadillac V8 engine is credited as the first mass-produced V8, and when Ford Motor Company acquired rival luxury marque Lincoln in 1922, it was already producing a flathead V8 with fork and blade connecting rods which remained in production after Ford took over until 1932.

Even though Ford had an engineering team assigned to develop its own V8, many of the ideas and innovations were Henry Ford&#x27;s. The Model A, its variants (B and 18), and this V8 engine were developed between 1926 and 1932, and this period was the elder Ford&#x27;s last central contribution to the company&#x27;s engineering.

Mercury&#x27;s version of the engine was introduced in 1939.

An economizing design feature of this engine was the use of three main bearings to support the crankshaft, rather than the customary five used with most V-8s. The flathead mounted the camshaft above the crankshaft, like later pushrod-operated overhead-valve engines. Valves for each bank were mounted inside the triangular area formed by the &quot;vee&quot; of cylinders. The intake manifold fed both banks from inside the vee, but the exhaust ports had to pass between the cylinders to reach the outboard exhaust manifolds, since it did not use a t-head configuration. Such an arrangement transferred exhaust heat to the block, imposing a large cooling load; it required far more coolant and radiator capacity than equivalent overhead-valve V8 engines. Ford flathead V8s were notorious for cracking blocks if their barely adequate cooling systems were overtaxed (such as in trucking or racing). The simple design left much room for improvement, and the power available after even low cost modifications was usually substantially more than could be obtained from an overhead-valve inline six-cylinder engine of similar displacement.

The Ford flathead V8 was licensed to other producers. It was used by Simca in France until 1961 and in Brazil until 1964 for cars and until 1990 in the Simca Unic Marmon Bocquet military truck. In the United States, the flathead V8 was replaced by the more modern overhead-valve Ford Y-block engine in 1954. During World War II, the engine was used on the first prototype of the Romanian Mareșal tank destroyer, but was considered too weak and thus replaced by more powerful engines for later versions of the vehicle.

==Components==
===Crankshaft===
The crankshaft development for the Ford flathead V8 was pioneering. The engine&#x27;s production development program began with a forged steel crank, per conventional practice, but Ford then developed the improved foundry practice, heat-treating, and materials handling logistics to make the cranks from cast steel instead, yielding a crank just as strong, but less expensive to produce. These new methods were patented. The simple three-main-bearing crankshaft attached two connecting rods to a single crankpin, one rod from each cylinder bank. As with other crankshafts, static and dynamic balancing was performed (as this video on the Ford flathead V8 shows).

The short crankshaft proved quite durable in comparison to six-cylinder engines when roughly handled. For these reasons, the flathead Ford became a favorite among hot-rodders, and this in turn led to a rich supply of aftermarket performance parts. With the use of specialized pistons or connecting rods the stroke of the crankshaft could be increased by welding and regrinding as a method of increasing engine displacement, usually in combination with overboring.

===Block===
One of the most important innovations in the Ford flathead V8 was the casting of the crankcase and all 8 cylinders in one engine block. This level of monobloc design for V-8 blocks had been accomplished before, but it had never seen mass production. Making it practical for the latter was an example of the production development needed to bring a V8 engine to the widely affordable segment of the market. Most V engines of the time had multiple cylinder blocks bolted to a common crankcase (itself a separate casting). At most, each bank of the V was an integral block, but many V engines had four- or even six-cylinder blocks, with cylinders cast in pairs or triples. Like most other engine blocks of the 20th century, it was cast iron; but the foundry practice (e.g., workflows, materials handling) was a revolutionary advancement in the mass production of castings. Charles E. Sorensen lived up to his longtime nickname at Ford, &quot;Cast-Iron Charlie&quot;, by leading this revolution to bring Ford&#x27;s first V8 to market.

As with any V8, the block was relatively light for the displacement supported. The cooling jacket reaches down to the bottom dead center, which is unusually low. American engineers at the time believed this would improve the piston cooling. The bottom of the block formed the parting line for the main bearing caps. The most complex part of the block was the exhaust passage routing. The exhaust valves were on the inside of the V and exhaust flow was initially downward and passed around the cylinders through the water jacket to exit on the outside of the cylinder block. The routing of the exhaust through the water jacket put an extremely heavy load on the cooling system and led to frequent overheating, especially on early models, if the cooling system was not maintained. Somewhat primitive water pumps used until the advent of the 1948 8RT and 1949 8BA models also contributed to the overheating problem. The space for the exhaust flow was also somewhat restricted, so the exhaust passages were tall and narrow in some locations. The gas flow past the rough sand castings could be greatly improved by polishing the passages. In early blocks, some cylinder walls were extremely thin due to cores shifting during casting.

===Bearings===
The engines built from 1932 to 1935 had poured main bearings which required skill and machine shop equipment to overhaul. Part of the 1936 production and all production from 1937 to the end of flathead V8 production had both replaceable shell main bearings and connecting rod inserts, enabling straightforward and low cost rebuilding, another reason why the Ford was a favorite of amateur mechanics. These shell main bearings are made of a cadmium silver alloy.

=== Camshaft and timing ===
The Ford flathead V8 has a single camshaft located inside the engine block above the crankshaft. It is spur gear driven; the camshaft&#x27;s spur gear is made of plastic. The camshaft has three camshaft bearings. A lid made of cast iron covers the camshaft spur gears; the ignition distributor is placed on top of this lid and is driven by the camshaft spur gears. For powering the fuel pump, the camshaft is fitted with an extra cam located in the bearing on the flywheel side.

===Lubrication===
Ford products used high oil pressure for lubrication for the main and rod bearings, as do all modern vehicle combustion engines. This offered a significant performance advantage, as full pressure lubrication allowed for continuous use above 3500 rpm and would not starve the rod bearings for oil, which was necessary for high performance applications, such as racing. For this reason, bank robber Clyde Barrow preferred to steal Fords as getaway vehicles. It also eliminated a complex oil jet system to feed the rod bearings in the oil pan. As a side benefit to a prospective purchaser of a used vehicle, this also enabled the condition of the connecting rod and main bearings to be determined indirectly by observation of the oil pressure gauge after the vehicle was warmed up, provided that oil of normal viscosity was in use.

===Exhaust===
The exhaust outlets in the 1932–48 cars and the 1932–47 trucks were near the front of the manifolds aiming down and sometimes out. A Y-pipe took the exhaust gases to the right side of the vehicle to a single muffler, then to a single pipe out the back on the right side. The left side exhaust manifold exhausted to the front in the 1949–53 Ford cars, where a crossover pipe took the exhaust to the forward end of the right side manifold on the car engines and between the 1st and second cylinder on some trucks, in turn exhausting to a single pipe at the rear.

A common conversion for the 1949–53 Ford cars and 1952–53 Mercurys was to block off the right forward manifold entrance and route the left side exhaust to a new pipe to form a dual exhaust system with better flow characteristics. These typically involved installation of free-flowing mufflers, which if at a legal noise level still allowed low frequency sounds to pass, giving a characteristic rumbling dual exhaust sound to these systems. In the 1950s shortcut exhaust outlets with manually removed covers were added to street machines in emulation of vehicles intended for high speed straight line racing on dry lake beds, typically located just behind the front wheel, although chromed external runners sometimes extended to just forward of the rear wheel. These covers were referred to as &quot;lake plugs&quot;, the pipes as &quot;lake pipes&quot;. This style exhaust was also used legally in sanctioned drag racing and illegally in unsanctioned performance demonstrations.

===Internal Air flow===
More extreme modifications were to improve the airflow by removing material from the top of the block between the valves and the cylinders (called &quot;relieving&quot;), increasing the size of the inlet and exhaust passages (called &quot;porting&quot;), and by &quot;polishing&quot; the sand-cast surfaces to improve air flow. Increased compression ratios could be cheaply obtained by milling material from the head or by obtaining aluminum heads as aftermarket parts. Higher capacity intake manifolds were similarly available. Changing the camshaft to a higher performance version required head removal so that the valves could be held up out of the way, so this was usually done only as part of a substantial rework of the basic engine.

===Overhead-valve kits===
A popular modification for the flathead was conversion to an overhead-valve configuration, and many such modification kits were available, including the &quot;Ardun&quot; heads from Zora Arkus-Duntov who was to go on to fame as the &quot;father of the Corvette&quot;. These conversions were not initially demanded by hot rodders looking for extra power, as they had not yet exhausted the capabilities of the flathead configuration, but were demanded by users of the engine in trucks and other such high load applications, where the constant flow of hot exhaust through the block to the exhaust manifolds caused the entire engine to overheat; the overhead-valve heads routed the exhaust out more directly, and away from the block.

==Hot-rodding applications==
In the early 1950s, many hot-rodders could not afford to purchase and modify even a &quot;cheap&quot; flathead V-8, and a large investment in machine work and aftermarket parts was necessary to bring a Ford flathead V-8 to even the performance levels of most stock OHV V-8s available at the time. Even many inline six-cylinder engines from that period could be modified to produce more reliable and practical power than Ford V-8s, as the Ford flathead V-8 is saddled with many design features that make modifying it for true high-performance use difficult and expensive compared with other V-8s.

As modern OHV V-8s became available and affordable in salvage yards, the Ford flathead V-8 rapidly disappeared from the hot-rodding scene. Hot-rodding in general moved away from the salvage-yard car builds as parts and labor became more expensive and many hot-rod shops priced themselves out of business. The modern OHV V-8 powered vehicles available also contributed to the demise of hot-rodding&#x27;s original culture (affordable modifications by working-class car owners), as new factory cars became capable of much higher performance than most hot-rods.

Today the flat-head Ford is mainly used in &quot;retro&quot; hot-rod builds by builders more interested in an historic feel and recreating history than performance. Even four-cylinder Ford engines are used to make a retro hot-rod &quot;correct&quot;.
===Modern performance flatheads===
Ford flatheads are still hot rodded today, with a special land speed record class for flathead engines. The current record holder achieves and . The current land speed record for a Ford flathead V8 stands at 302.462mph.

==Tractor conversions==
During the 1930s to 1950s, the farm market in North America and parts of Europe demanded ever-increasing power output from farm tractors. It was in this climate that Ford experimented with V-8 tractor designs, some individual farmers converted their 4-cylinder tractors to Ford inline-6 or V-8 engines, and a few aftermarket companies offered such conversions for sale. Among the latter, the best-known were Funk conversions by brothers Joe and Howard Funk. In the 1930s, the Funk brothers built aircraft—including the Funk B, which used an engine design based on Ford engines. In the late 1940s, their aircraft line became unprofitable, but they found renewed profitability in aftermarket parts for tractors—transmissions, engines, and accessories. They sold many converted Ford N-Series tractors and conversion kits using Ford industrial inline-6 engines and Ford flathead V-8 engines.

==Version types==

Types are classified by their displacement.

===221===
The original flathead engine displaced , with bore and stroke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Street Rodder, 1/85, p73&quot; &gt;&quot;Street Rodder&quot;, 1/85, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The block was cast as a single piece (&quot;monobloc&quot;) for durability, and a single-barrel carburetor fed the engine. The 1932 V8-18 with 5.5:1 compression produced . The 1933–34 V8-40 raised compression to 6.33:1 and power to . In 1934 a two barrel down draft carburetor was introduced. 1935&#x27;s V8-48 saw compression drop to 6.3:1, but power climb to , and torque was rated at . It became the V8-68 in 1936, with compression, horsepower, and torque unchanged.

Production of the original 221 lasted from 1932 through to 1936. These engines can be identified by the fact that the water pumps are at the front of the heads. A similar 221 flathead was used in Fords for 1937 and 1938 but the block was revised to have the water pumps mounted on the block. This design also relocated the water outlet from the front of the heads to the top center of the heads. These, designated V8-78, were offered with standard 6.2:1 compression aluminum or 7.5:1 compression iron cylinder heads, rated at and (aluminum) or (iron). The 1932 through 1938 motors used twenty-one studs to hold down each head and are known as &quot;21 stud&quot; motors. This motor continued to be made into the 1950s in Europe.

In late 1938 Ford introduced V8-81A, commonly called the &quot;24 stud&quot; engine because it uses twenty-four studs to hold down each head. This engine debuted at the same time as the 239 motor. With 6.12:1 compression, horsepower remained the same, but torque increased by . In 1939, as the V8-91A, compression increased to 6.15:1, power rose to , and torque reached ; the ratings remained the same for the 1940 V8-01A, 1941 V8-11A, and the last civilian model, the V8-21A, which saw compression rise to 6.2:1. This engine was used through 1942 for civilian use and saw some use in military vehicles during World War Two. Collectively all of the 221 motors are commonly referred to as &quot;85 horse&quot; motors.

===239===

Ford introduced the V8-99A engine with bore and stroke and 6.15:1 compression in 1939. It produced and . This was done to provide a more powerful engine for the Mercury cars, which Ford Motor Company started making in 1939. It was used in Mercurys in 1939 and in Fords in 1946. This engine is very similar to later versions of the 221 engine. As the V8-09A in 1940, compression, power, and torque were unchanged; in 1941, the V8-19A compression and power were static, but torque rose by , while the 1942 V8-29A increased compression to 6.4:1 and power to , while torque stayed the same. Postwar, it became the V8-69 (suffixed &quot;A&quot; in Fords, &quot;M&quot; in Mercurys), with compression 6.75:1, , and . For 1947 and 1948, only the designation changed, to V8-79 and -89. The 239 was redesigned in 1948 as the 8RT for Ford trucks and in 1949 as the 8BA for the cars. It had higher 6.8:1 compression, but performance was unchanged. The 1950 V8-0BA boosted torque by , the 1951 -1BA by more, while in 1952, as the V8-B2, compression climbed to 7.2:1, power to , and torque to , then to in the -B3 of 1953, its final year. The 1948 to 1953 engines have a revised cooling and ignition system. Collectively all 239 engines are referred to as &quot;100 horse&quot; engines, although the horsepower was increased in 1952 to 110 horsepower in cars and 106 horsepower in trucks. This engine was used in Ford&#x27;s transit buses during the most productive years of the company&#x27;s short stint in the transit bus business from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s, most notably in the 1939–1947 version of the Ford Transit Bus.

The latest iteration of this engine was used from 1948 to 1953 in the U.S and till 1954 in Canada. It was initially designated the 8BA (see above) in automobiles and the 8RT in trucks. 8RT remained the truck engine designation throughout the entire run from 1948 through 1953 in the U.S (1954 in Canada). The engines were essentially identical. Earlier Ford V8s had the unique Ford designed distributor driven directly from the forward end of the camshaft, which was an inconvenient location for maintenance. This final flathead used a more conventional distributor driven at a right angle to the crankshaft and located at the right front of the engine where it was readily accessible. The water inlets and thermostat housings were moved to the front end of the heads, and the 21 studs and nuts that attached the heads on the old engine were replaced by 24 bolts.

===136===

A V8-74 version was introduced in the United States in 1937. With bore and stroke and 6.6:1 compression, the engine was rated and . The designation changed again in 1939, to V8-922A, but the specifications remained the same. It was produced in Europe in 1935 and 1936, and was used in the many standard Ford vehicles based on the car platform of the era. It was not very popular with U.S. buyers who were used to the cars. Redesignated V8-82A in 1938, V8-922A in 1939, and V8-022A in 1940, compression, power, and torque remained unchanged. The engine was very popular as a powerplant for midget race cars after World War II. This engine is most commonly referred to as the &quot;60 horse&quot; flathead, or the V8-60. It was replaced by the 226 straight-6 in the 1941 Fords, though it would continue to be used after the war in the French Ford Vedette and the British Ford Pilot.

In 1952 Ford France (who called this engine the &quot;Aquilon&quot;) created a somewhat bored out version displacing . Production was taken over by Simca in 1954 who began installing it in their Simca Vedette in 1955. Simca then transferred the Aquilon production line to Simca do Brasil, where it was kept in production until 1969 (the company was known as Chrysler Brazil from July 1967). Simca do Brasil introduced a version in May 1962 but the real surprise was the &quot;Emi-Sul&quot; of April 1966. This engine has overhead valves and hemispherical combustion chambers; it produced in its most powerful version.

===255===
The 1948–1953 , referred to as the model BG, was achieved by use of a stroke crankshaft in the 8BA/8RT engine. It was only used in Mercury cars, and heavy service trucks. Known as the V8-9CM in 1949, it featured 6.8:1 compression, , and torque, which stayed the same for the 1950 V8-0CM. The 1951 V8-1CM raised this by , and torque, The 1952 V8-MA boosted compression to 7.2:1, power to , and torque to , while only the name changed, dropping the -MA, for the last year of production, 1953.

Because of interchangeability, the Mercury crank made a popular upgrade in the 239 among hot rodders. In fact, in the 1950s, the flathead block was often fitted with crankshafts of up to stroke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Street Rodder, 1/85, p72&quot; &gt;&quot;Street Rodder&quot;, 1/85, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rodders in the 1950s routinely bored them out by (to ).

French-built 255 engines were fitted to the Simca Unic Marmon Bocquet (SUMB) light trucks of the French military. During the 1990s, the Ford V8 that was used in these trucks was decommissioned and removed for more economical Renault engines to be retrofitted. Thus the Ford V8 engines were sold off and thus provided a new source of little-worn engines for the hotrodding community. The block metallurgy, being much later, was also stronger than the originals.

===337===
The largest displacement version (at ) of the production Ford flathead V8 engine was designed for large truck service. When Lincoln could not produce the V12 engine it wanted for the 1949 model year, the 337 engine was adapted for passenger car use. The 337 features a bore and a stroke.

It was introduced in the 1948 two and a half ton and three ton Ford trucks and the 1949 Lincoln passenger cars. It was produced through the 1951 model year. In 1952 it was replaced in the Lincoln passenger cars and Ford three ton trucks with the Lincoln Y-block overhead-valve V8. The two and a half ton Ford trucks got a version of the 317 engine.

In the song &quot;Hot Rod Lincoln&quot;, the engine referred to in the original lyrics was a Lincoln V12 not mentioned in the Commander Cody version.

<doc id="1146094" wikidata="Q1207936" url="?curid=1146094" title="Woman in the Dunes">
<text>is a 1964 Japanese New Wave avant-garde psychological thriller film directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara and starring Eiji Okada, Kyōko Kishida, and Kōji Mitsui. It received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for two Academy Awards. The screenplay for the film was adapted by Kōbō Abe from his 1962 novel of the same name. The film follows an amateur entomologist (Okada) who is led to settle in the house of a lonely widow (Kishida) at the bottom of a sand dune in a rural coastal village. He soon realizes that the villagers have trapped him there and expect him to work for them.

Woman in the Dunes was an independent, joint production of Teshigahara Productions and the Japanese Art Theater Guild, a group of young film- makers involved in an attempt to create political-aesthetical films in opposition to the dominant studio productions of the 1960s, which they viewed as commercial, unartistic, and uninteresting

The film is considered to be Teshigahara&#x27;s masterpiece, and is now widely regarded as one of thegreatest films of all time.
==Plot==
Schoolteacher and amateur entomologist Niki Junpei leaves Tokyo on an expedition to a rural coastal village to collect tiger beetles and other insects that live in sandy soil. After a long day of searching, he misses the last bus ride back to the city. A village elder and some of the other locals suggest that he stay the night at their village. Junpei agrees and is guided down a rope ladder to a hut at the bottom of a sand dune, the home of a young woman. He learns that she lost her husband and daughter in a sandstorm a year ago and now lives alone; their bodies are said to be buried under the sand somewhere near the hut. After dinner, the woman goes outside to shovel the sand into buckets, which the villagers reel in from the top of the dune. Junpei offers to help, but she refuses, telling him that he is a guest and there is no need for him to help on the first day.

The next morning, Junpei gets ready to leave but finds that the rope ladder has been pulled up. Unable to escape, as the sand surrounding the hut is too steep and does not give him enough grip to climb, he quickly realises that he is trapped and expected to live with the woman and assist her in digging the sand, which is sold to cement manufacturers on the black market. He begrudgingly accepts this role, which the woman has long accepted without question.

Junpei becomes the widow&#x27;s lover but hopes to escape. One evening, he climbs out of the pit with an improvised grappling hook and runs away, with the villagers in pursuit. Unfamiliar with the geography of the area, he becomes trapped in quicksand. The villagers free him and return him to the hut.

Junpei eventually resigns himself to his situation but requests time each day to see the nearby sea; the villagers agree on the condition that he has sex with the woman while they watch. Junpei agrees, but she refuses and fends him off. Through his persistent efforts to trap a crow as a messenger, he discovers a way to draw water from the damp sand at night by capillary action and becomes absorbed in perfecting the technique. When the woman becomes ill from an ectopic pregnancy, the villagers take her to a doctor; they leave the rope ladder down, but Junpei chooses to stay, telling himself that he can still escape after showing the villagers his method of water production.

The film&#x27;s final shot is of a police report stating that Junpei has been missing for seven years.

==Cast==
* Eiji Okada as Niki Junpei, an amateur entomologist and schoolteacher from Tokyo. Okada was cast in various Japanese films in the 1950s, but it was not until he appeared in &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot; in 1959 that he gained a worldwide reputation.
* Kyōko Kishida as the widow in the dunes. Kishida was a Japanese actress, voice performer, and writer of children&#x27;s books. In addition to &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot;, in the West she is best known for &quot;The Face of Another&quot; (1966, also directed by Teshigahara) and Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;An Autumn Afternoon&quot; (1962). She was a founding member of the theater group Engeki Shudan En, which was formed in 1975.
* Kōji Mitsui as the village elder who lures the entomologist to the widow&#x27;s home. He was billed above the film&#x27;s title on the original &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; film poster, alongside Okada and Kishida, with the studio-era convention of appending his name with small characters indicating that Toho had borrowed the contracted player from Shochiku.

==Production==
===Development===
Prior to the production of &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot;, Hiroshi Teshigahara directed , a.k.a. &quot;The Pitfall&quot; and &quot;Kashi To Kodomo&quot;, which was written by Kōbō Abe. &quot;Pitfall&quot; was Teshigahara&#x27;s first feature, and the first of his four film collaborations with Abe and Takemitsu.

===Technical details===
With a run time of 123 minutes / 147 minutes (director&#x27;s cut), the film was shot in 35 mm negative format by Hiroshi Segawa, the director of photography.

===Location===
&quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; was shot on location at the Hamaoka sand dunes in Omaezaki, Shizuoka Prefecture, although many sources in English erroneously report that the film was shot in the Tottori Sand Dunes in Tottori Prefecture.

===Release===
The roadshow version of &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; was released in Japan on February 15, 1964 where it was distributed by Toho. The general release for &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; in Japan was April 18, 1964; the film was cut to 127 minutes.

The film was released in the United States by Pathe Contemporary Films with English subtitles on September 17, 1964. The film ran at 127 minutes. The film was also featured in the New York Film Festival on September 16, 1964.

The film was also featured in several other film festivals across the world such as the Cannes Film Festival in France, Adelaide Film Festival in Australia, and Clasicos del Cine Japones in Argentina on November 21, 2000.

The Criterion Collection released a DVD box set collecting &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; in its original length along with Teshigahara&#x27;s &quot;Pitfall&quot; and &quot;The Face of Another&quot; in 2007. This release is now out of print. In August 2016, Criterion released the film as a stand-alone Blu-ray with a brand new high definition transfer.

== Critical reception ==
The film has a rating of 100% on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. It was one of Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s ten favorite movies.

Roger Ebert inducted &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; into his Great Movies list in 1998. Viewing the work as a retelling of the Sisyphus myth, he wrote: &quot;There has never been sand photography like this (no, not even in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;), and by anchoring the story so firmly in this tangible physical reality, the cinematographer, Hiroshi Segawa, helps the director pull off the difficult feat of telling a parable as if it is really happening.&quot; Strictly Film School describes it as &quot;a spare and haunting allegory for human existence&quot;. According to Max Tessier, the main theme of the film is the desire to escape from society.

The film&#x27;s composer, Toru Takemitsu, was praised. Nathaniel Thompson wrote, &quot;[Takemitsu&#x27;s] often jarring, experimental music here is almost a character unto itself, insinuating itself into the fabric of the celluloid as imperceptibly as the sand.&quot; Ebert also stated that the score &quot;doesn&#x27;t underline the action but mocks it, with high, plaintive notes, harsh, like a metallic wind.&quot;

=== Awards ===
The film won a Special Jury Prize at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in the same year (losing to &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot;). In 1965, Teshigahara was nominated for the Best Director Oscar (losing to Robert Wise for &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;). In 1967, the film won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.

<doc id="1146107" wikidata="Q7598425" url="?curid=1146107" title="Broadcast Standards and Practices">
<text>In the United States, Standards and Practices (also referred to as Broadcast Standards and Practices or BS&amp;P for short) is the name traditionally given to the department at a television network which is responsible for the moral, ethical, and legal implications of the program that the network airs. Standards and Practices also ensure fairness on televised game shows, in which they are the adjunct to the judges at the production company level in. They also have the power to reprimand and recommend the termination of television network stars and employees for violations of standards and practices, performing the same role as that of an organizational ombudsman in other media industries, balancing the needs and requirements of the broadcaster, the creators, the viewing audience, and governmental authority in various federal bureaus.

==Examples of intervention==
*The Standards and Practices department of NBC censored one of Jack Paar&#x27;s jokes on the February 10, 1960, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

:Paar was so very taken aback by the network&#x27;s decision to censor the joke, he walked off the live show the very next day. As he left his desk in the middle of the program, he said, &quot;I am leaving &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. There must be a better way of, uh, making a living than this.&quot; Paar reappeared on March 7, 1960, strolled on stage, struck a pose, and said, &quot;As I was saying before I was interrupted...&quot; After the audience erupted in applause, Paar continued, &quot;When I walked off, I said there must be a better way of making a living. Well, I&#x27;ve looked... and there isn&#x27;t.&quot; He then went on to explain his departure with typical frankness: &quot;Leaving the show was a childish and perhaps emotional thing. I have been guilty of such action in the past and will perhaps be again. I&#x27;m totally unable to hide what I feel. It is not an asset in show business, but I shall do the best I can to amuse and entertain you and let other people speak freely, as I have in the past.&quot;

* Prior to filming the 2007 double-episode &quot;The Gang Gets Whacked&quot; of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, the network FX banned the actors from miming snorting cocaine or snorting another substance, but rather would be allowed to place the drug against their gums.

===Animation===
*&quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; was very heavily influenced by Fox Kids&#x27;s BS&amp;P, with characters never really coming into mortal danger nor engaging in hand-to-hand combat.

*The CGI series &quot;ReBoot&quot; was heavily censored by ABC during its two-season run on the network. The network announced the show would be cancelled after its second season after it was purchased by The Walt Disney Company, which would make way for a schedule of all Disney-produced series. The writers wrote scripts for episodes that mocked ABC&#x27;s S&amp;P department due to it being cancelled, including the insertion of unnoticed profanity within a stream of binary numbers. &quot;ReBoot&quot; went on to produce another successful season and two made-for-TV movies on other networks which had less strict S&amp;P departments and content standards.

* Episode 97 of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2003) was unaired in the United States until 2015 due to pressures from Fox Broadcast &amp; Standards (although 4Kids Entertainment leased the time from the network for their FoxBox block and aired the series, it still had to meet Fox&#x27;s broadcast standards). On the official TMNT website, Lloyd Goldfine states:

: The episode finally aired in the United States on August 2, 2015 on Nicktoons after Paramount purchased the rights to the &quot;TMNT&quot; franchise.

Cartoon Network and its Adult Swim programming block has had various instances of publicly disclosed Standards and Practices encounters:

* The final three episodes of the first season of &quot;Moral Orel&quot; were held back for various amounts of time by Standards and Practices due to being too dark and over the top sexually crude even for Adult Swim, despite regularly originating TV-MA content. Another episode entitled &quot;God&#x27;s Chef&quot; was delayed for months before the Adult Swim network was able to show it. It has since been released uncensored, along with the rest of Season 1 and part of Season 2, on DVD.
* Adult Swim programming director Kim Manning revealed in the network&#x27;s now-defunct online message boards that Adult Swim inquired into airing &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; in April 2006, but was rejected by its Standards and Practices department because the series contained graphic violence and nudity. The only way the department would approve its airing was to have it extensively edited, so the network ultimately decided not to broadcast at the expense of altering the original work at such a level. Manning stated in the same post that this was also the case with &quot;Gantz&quot;.

* In 2014, according to Rebecca Sugar, the creator of &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, Cartoon Network Standards and Practices Department informed her that Ruby and Sapphire, who fused together as Garnet, couldn&#x27;t &quot;kiss on the mouth.&quot; Even though, after March 2015, following the release of &quot;Jail Break&quot;, fans picked up on the relationship between Ruby and Sapphire, and Pearl&#x27;s love for Rose Quartz, the show&#x27;s crew were prohibited from confirming these relationships. Sugar noted that, when she pitched the episode that would become &quot;Reunited&quot; in 2015, she was told that the International Standards and Practices Department of Cartoon Network might object to language about Garnet, and she pushed back more after Ian Jones-Quartey proposed to her. Sugar also noted that a signing card she would give out at San Diego Comic-Con in 2015 was deemed &quot;too romantic,&quot; because some at Cartoon Network might become &quot;upset&quot; with the direction of the show. She also noted that after the September 2016 publication of &quot;The Answer&quot;, a children&#x27;s book adaptation of the episode &quot;The Answer&quot;, she was brought into a meeting and &quot;asked to explain herself,&quot; noting that she would, in meetings like this, defend the show&#x27;s stories and &quot;audience of queer youth.&quot;

In June 2021, Abbey White of Insider argued that one of the reasons that children&#x27;s animation were stymied in their attempts to be more inclusive for decades was due to Standards and Practices departments within networks, the latter which interpreted rating guidelines and definitions of profanity, indecency, and obscenity by the FCC, to guide their notes to crew working on various animated series. One former Cartoon Network executive quoted in the story, Katie Krentz, told the publication that these departments have &quot;wide-ranging content guidelines&quot; on hand, which regulate just about everything, &quot;from characters&#x27; technology use to their diet.&quot; White noted that these departments, as do studio executives, determine whether words such as &quot;pride&quot; or &quot;gay,&quot; or other LGBTQ terms, can be shown on onscreen or said by a character. According to White, this included an unnamed Cartoon Network series in the mid-2010s where writers had to refer to a character&#x27;s same-gender parents singularly as &quot;Mom&quot; rather than &quot;Moms.&quot; Even so, the story said that while these departments have a huge sway, the conservative pushback to certain shows have led to the removal of content, and said that top executives have the power to make changes to increase inclusion. Although streaming companies do not have such departments, Krentz argued that, as a result, decisions about LGBTQ representation in a show falls on the &quot;belief system and background&quot; of a single person, putting pressure on creative executives.

==Game show incidents==

Resulting from the 1950s quiz show scandals, game shows have been closely monitored by network standards and practices departments for possible irregularities. Subsequent to the quiz show scandals, a detailed document is prepared for each show by the show&#x27;s producers, which sets forth the exact rules of the game. This document is referred to as the &quot;bible&quot;. The bible is then used as the definitive authority regarding game play. The contestant release form, which is executed by all contestants, contains language to the effect that decisions of the producer shall be final.

When an irregularity occurs, the most common remedy is to permit the contestant to appear and play the game again at a later date. Disclaimers are also a regular part of a closing credits roll, stating that dead portions of the game which had no ramifications were edited for time to meet final cut, and points/money are added/subtracted for a successful appeal of the correctness of an answer.

===&quot;The Price Is Right&quot;===
On rare occasions, contestants who have lost games because of procedural irregularities have been awarded the prizes. Irregularities have occurred when either the prize descriptions or prices displayed for the item in question have been incorrect, mechanical errors/malfunctions with certain pricing game props, or administrative errors by models, announcer, or the host (such as a misheard bid, models not doing what the contestant requested, or announcing the price of a prize when it was not supposed to be there). When such an error occurs, the contestant is awarded any prizes in question. If the error is discovered before the ensuing Showcase Showdown (on hour shows), the host informs the contestant upon returning from commercial or before the Showdown, and the contestant is re-seeded for the Showcase Showdown based on the additional winnings. If the error is discovered after the ensuing Showcase Showdown or in post-production, either a disclaimer appears or is read by the announcer during the closing credits of the show.

If a contestant is discovered to be ineligible, the ineligible contestant will forfeit all prizes, and likewise a disclaimer appears or a statement is read by the announcer at the end of the show. If the ineligible contestant is found to have won a One Bid, the contestants on Contestants&#x27; Row at the time the ineligible contestant was playing and did not win a One Bid are entitled to return to the show immediately once the infraction is discovered, per game show regulations, as their appearance was compromised by an ineligible contestant, pursuant to all game show regulations. The ten-year rule (in which a contestant that gets called up on stage during the show may return if their last appearance on the show was at least 10 years to the day of airing) imposed in 2007 will not be in effect if a contestant lost a One Bid to an ineligible contestant and did not win a further One Bid during that episode.

One of the contestants on the original September 6, 1972 episode (the third show overall) was the common-law wife of a cameraman, and therefore ineligible to appear on any CBS game show. The episode never aired, but the other winners kept their prizes (a replacement show was taped and aired in its place).

On September 8, 2005, CBS aired a repeat airing of &quot;The Price is Right&quot; from December 2004 featuring a contestant being offered a prize for a trip to New Orleans. While the trip to New Orleans and other tourism-based cities are common prizes on the show, the repeat aired less than two weeks following the city&#x27;s destruction by Hurricane Katrina and many viewers finding it tactless for CBS to air the episode; network executives quickly caught the mistake and pulled the episode from West Coast airings before its scheduled start time in those markets. CBS subsequently pulled two episodes that were taped in June and July 2005 that also featured trips to New Orleans (one of which was in the Showcase and both were won by their respective contestants) and aired them several months afterwards while the city was still recovering from Katrina. Each such episode aired at the end of the season with a statement from either of the state&#x27;s two senators. Other contestants on the shows were offered their prizes shortly after the postponement was announced and a DVD was sent to each contestant. A similar situation happened with an episode scheduled for February 7, 2023 (#0102L). The episode was pulled hours before its intended broadcast because of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes, which happened the day prior. The sixth pricing game had featured a trip to Istanbul. Although the city was over 1,000 kilometers from the fault line, CBS pulled the broadcast. On the intended rescheduled broadcast date, CBS was forced again to postpone because of disasters in Maui. The episode was burned off on November 24, 2023, in Season 53. The same procedure was done where non-trip prizes offered were awarded based on the intended broadcast date. Trip prizes were treated differently under show policies, although it is not known if the player was awarded cash substitutions because of the disaster.

In a playing of Plinko taped July 22, 2008, a prop official forgot to remove a fishing line used in the taping of a previous promotion for the official Ludia video game (which guided the chip into a confined pattern leading into the $10,000 channel) before having it readied for game play. A contestant won $30,000 before the mistake was discovered by Associate Producer Adam Sandler (who is now the show&#x27;s lead producer; not to be confused with the actor). The game was repaired by having the line removed, and the contestant started at $0. The contestant was allowed to keep the $30,000 because of the violation of procedure, plus the money won during the actual game; however, the $30,000 did not count towards the contestant&#x27;s cumulative winnings on the show.

During a September 22, 2008 taping, contestant Terry Kneiss made a perfect Showcase bid. CBS Standards and Practices, host Drew Carey, and producer Kathy Greco became highly suspicious that another party in the studio audience had supplied Kneiss with the bid, which then resulted in a stopdown of taping as an investigation took place. Although the contestant was ultimately awarded the prizes, the show air date was moved back from its original schedule. As a result of the incident, the show changed its practice regarding prizes, adding up to 30 new prizes which began appearing each taping week. Carey wrote on his blog before the 2009 season premiere that with so few prizes being offered, &quot;It was possible, if one wanted, to watch the show for a while and memorize the price of almost every prize we offered.&quot; The show wanted to prevent a situation similar to 1984 &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; incident where contestant Michael Larson memorized the board&#x27;s light pattern to land on the largest cash value space which offered an additional spin and was able to avoid a space with the show&#x27;s signature villain, which served as a bankrupt space which would result in the forfeit of his winnings.

Since 2009, CBS Standards and Practices also requires a disclaimer regarding the business interest of host Drew Carey to be mentioned any time a prize features game tickets featuring the Seattle Sounders FC Major League Soccer club, or a player of Sounders FC makes an appearance to present a prize on the show, or the club and its players are mentioned by the host or contestant. If a Sounders FC prize package is offered in a One Bid, pricing game or in the Showcase, Carey must mention on-air his ownership stake during the bidding. On the December 15, 2010 episode, after a contestant wore Sounders FC merchandise and the contestant and host talked about the team, the show ran a disclaimer in the credits stating Carey&#x27;s ownership interest in Sounders FC. Disclaimers may also be run if other MLS club kits are worn on-air.

In one instance, the host admitted to an error and it was reviewed by them and a staff member immediately. During the January 30, 2017 episode, a contestant played the &quot;Clock Game&quot;. Host Drew Carey made a mistake in giving &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; after the contestant&#x27;s bids. Carey admitted to the mistake after the first prize was correctly guessed, then shown discussing the infraction with a camera operator. Instant replay review was called by officials, which led to six additional seconds added to the remaining time based on his mistake. The contestant won the second prize, and an additional bonus prize, with one second remaining after the adjustment.

In one situation, a theme week with rule changes caused a Standards and Practices violation. On April 23, 2013, during Big Money Week, a contestant played Grand Game for $100,000 instead of the normal prize of $10,000. The contestant lost at the third guess, which normally is $100, but was $1,000 for Big Money Week. When a contestant has three successful guesses, the contestant is asked if they are to risk their $1,000 for $10,000, but if they are wrong, they lose everything. If a contestant has one or two successful guesses, the wrong answer denotes the contestant retains what they had won in the game. The board operator flipped the game board to show loss at $1,000, where the game board displays 0 (Gas Money displays &quot;0000&quot; when a contestant loses the game; Grand Game displays 0 only if the contestant gambles and misses on the fourth guess). At the ensuing Showcase Showdown, host Drew Carey informed the contestant the official committed a Standards and Practices violation, and the contestant won $1,000, as was prescribed in the rules for two correct guesses but missing on the third (since the game started at $10 instead of $1 for this playing).

On an episode airing December 26, 2023, announcer George Gray accidentally revealed the price of a Nissan Frontier truck in his prize copy before Switcheroo, which is a game where the contestant is intended to guess the price of five different prizes, including the truck. The noise in the audience drowned out the accidental price reveal. Audience members who heard the price revealed assisted the contestant to win the truck, which would likely have been awarded had he lost the game because of a standards and practices violation by the announcer (similar to a situation where a model accidentally revealed the price of a car in Five Price Tags, in which the contestant automatically won the car).

Also, in compliance with Standards and Practices since the move to Haven Studios, audience attendance restrictions are now implemented. One taping may offer prizes used in previous tapings that day (Season 52) or will be used in subsequent tapings that day (Season 53). That taping is restricted where in Season 52, no audience member from the two morning tapings could attend the late taping, or in Season 53, no audience member of the early taping can attend the middle or late taping.

===Other game shows===
Contestants on other game shows, such as &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, have been brought back on later episodes after a judging error or an error related to question material had been discovered. Other contestants have had prize money awarded despite not seeing their episodes air due to circumstances beyond theirs or the show&#x27;s control.

====&quot;The Money Drop&quot;====

On December 20, 2010, &quot;Million Dollar Money Drop&quot; contestants Gabe Okoye and Brittany Mayi lost $800,000 on a bad question:
* Which of these was sold in stores first?
# Macintosh Computer
# Sony Walkman
# Post-it notes

They decided to risk $800,000 on the Post-it notes. According to the show, the Post-it notes were first sold in 1980 and the Walkman was first sold in 1979. The answer was flawed after Internet research indicated that the Post-its were first tested for sale in four cities in 1977 before their nationwide introduction in 1980. In a statement by executive producer Jeff Apploff, the information obtained by the show&#x27;s research department was incomplete. Due to this research error, Gabe and Brittany were originally going to be invited back for a second chance to play the game, even though their question was not the deciding question in their game. The show was canceled before that could happen. A similar situation happened on the UK version in October 2010 on a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; question. (By rule, producers could have compensated the affected players.)

====&quot;Press Your Luck&quot;====

In an episode of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, the three players were asked a question regarding which cartoon character used the phrase &quot;sufferin&#x27; succotash!&quot; After the first contestant buzzed in with the answer &quot;Sylvester&quot;, host Peter Tomarken gave two other choices of Goofy and Daffy Duck. The other two contestants all went with Sylvester, but Tomarken said the correct answer was Daffy Duck. In actuality, &quot;both&quot; Sylvester and Daffy Duck have said the phrase. During post-production of the episode the error was discovered and a taped segment, in which Tomarken got a &quot;phone call&quot; from &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; voice actor Mel Blanc (in the voice of Sylvester), explained the mistake and that all three contestants would be invited back on future episodes.

=== Sony Pictures Television game shows ===
These are incidents with the three game shows from Sony, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, and &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire&quot; (the last part of Sony since 2008)

* Standards and Practices will adjudicate special disclaimers broadcast in unique cases.
** An answer will have a different correct question when the show was recorded compared to the time the show airs. During the 2014 summer Jeopardy! Teen Tournament first round match: the answer in the $400 My Present Government Job category in the Jeopardy! round was, &quot;Kathleen Sebelius, Insuring America, one person at a time.&quot; The correct response was &quot;What is the Secretary of Health and Human Services?&quot; However, she had resigned from that position in April 2014, between the taping of the match in March 2014 and the July 22, 2014 broadcast. The show posted a disclaimer, &quot;Recorded in March 2014,&quot; as the category was being read.
** Current events between taping and may also require the disclaimer. The death of Paul Walker occurred on November 30, 2013. The ensuing Monday (December 2, 2013), an episode of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; filmed October 4, 2013 featured the toss-up puzzle &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (the movie franchise which he played Brian O&#x27;Conner). Viewers complained to Sony about sensitivity in the wake of Walker&#x27;s death days prior. Although the show is taped in advance, with no returning champions, Sony had already posted on Wheel&#x27;s Web site that week&#x27;s players and since the episode had been sent to the program&#x27;s affiliates, it was impossible to pull the episode. That night, Sony posted on Twitter that night condolences to the Walker family and a note of the program recording date.
** The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has affected &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; On March 4, 2022, days after the invasion, the quiz show broadcast the following answer: &quot;The Kerch Strait -- Along with Serious Border Issues -- Separates Russia From This Country on The Black Sea.&quot; The correct question was &quot;What is Ukraine?&quot; Sony added to the broadcast when it was being sent, &quot;Recorded on January 11, 2022,&quot; and posted on Twitter the date of recording before broadcast. Similarly, on the Polish version in 2022, a player&#x27;s misspelling of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Final Jeopardy! was ruled incorrect for the answer, “On February 25, 2022, he said he needed ammunition, not a ride”.
* In 1999, a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; contestant who lost on a &quot;Jeopardy! Teen Tournament&quot; game on a questionable ruling during Final Jeopardy! was ordered to be brought back for the 2000 College Championship.
* The September 11 through September 14, 2001 episodes of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; aired only on a few stations in the United States due to continuous breaking news coverage of the September 11 attacks wholesale pre-empting the show throughout the United States and Canada outside of a few non-news carrying independent stations airing it. As &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; has rules where the funds for the cash prizes won by contestants on the series are only issued a set period after the episode has aired (and where the show&#x27;s confidentiality agreement regarding the results of a game has not been breached), the program&#x27;s Standards and Practices had to issue a one-time exception for those contestants (along with others who had won cash and prizes on sister series &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; on the same airdates [which also has the same policy regarding the timing of the awarding of cash and prizes]) due to the extraordinary circumstance where the results were unseen until cycled into the show&#x27;s weekend rerun feed or aired on Game Show Network years later, while the four &quot;Wheel&quot; episodes aired in the Washington area late night Sunday, September 16, 2001 on WJLA-TV in a two-hour block.
* A January 30, 2008 episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; resulted in Arianna Kelly being brought back on an episode on July 8, 2008 when officials found questionable calls during game play against her during that episode.
* In 2001, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; contestant Ed Toutant was given the following question:
** Toutant selected Tomato, but the show said it was Potato. It was later found the answer was flawed after further research from Marc Knight, a professor at Oxford University Department of Plant Sciences. The glowing &quot;potato&quot; was, in fact, developed in &quot;Scotland&quot;; however, Knight had developed a glowing &quot;tomato&quot; in England. Therefore, Toutant&#x27;s answer of &quot;tomato&quot; was correct. The $860,000 Skins Game jackpot was in use at the time, and he was allowed to play for the million and the skins game jackpot, which he eventually won.
* Patrick Hugh won $1,000 during a Season 7 (syndicated) episode, but a critical word in his $25,000 question was found to be misspelled. He was given the option of being awarded $25,000 &quot;no questions asked&quot; or to forfeit his winnings and return to the show and begin his game with a new $25,000 question with all four of his lifelines reinstated. Hugh chose the latter option, used two lifelines (Ask the Audience/Double-Dip) to correctly answer his new $25,000 question, and missed the $50,000 question after using his Phone-a-Friend and Ask-the-Expert lifelines, so he left with $25,000 this time.

==In other countries==
* In the Philippines, the term network ombudsman (also referred to as office of the network ombudsman) is used for this department.

<doc id="1146115" wikidata="Q1931185" url="?curid=1146115" title="Astronomical radio source">
<text>An astronomical radio source is an object in outer space that emits strong radio waves. Radio emission comes from a wide variety of sources. Such objects are among the most extreme and energetic physical processes in the universe.

==History==
In 1932, American physicist and radio engineer Karl Jansky detected radio waves coming from an unknown source in the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Jansky was studying the origins of radio frequency interference for Bell Laboratories. He found &quot;...a steady hiss type static of unknown origin&quot;, which eventually he concluded had an extraterrestrial origin. This was the first time that radio waves were detected from outer space. The first radio sky survey was conducted by Grote Reber and was completed in 1941. In the 1970s, some stars in the Milky Way were found to be radio emitters, one of the strongest being the unique binary MWC 349.

==Sources: Solar System==

===The Sun===
As the nearest star, the Sun is the brightest radiation source in most frequencies, down to the radio spectrum at 300 MHz (1 m wavelength). When the Sun is quiet, the galactic background noise dominates at longer wavelengths. During geomagnetic storms, the Sun will dominate even at these low frequencies.

===Jupiter===

Oscillation of electrons trapped in the magnetosphere of Jupiter produce strong radio signals, particularly bright in the decimeter band.

The magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet&#x27;s polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io injects gas into Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.

===Ganymede===

In 2021 news outlets reported that scientists, with the &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft that orbits Jupiter since 2016, detected an FM radio signal from the moon Ganymede at a location where the planet&#x27;s magnetic field lines connect with those of its moon. According to the reports these were caused by cyclotron maser instability and were similar to both WiFi-signals and Jupiter&#x27;s radio emissions. A study about the radio emissions was published in September 2020 but did not describe them to be of FM nature or similar to WiFi signals.

==Sources: Galactic==
=== The Galactic Center ===
The center of the Milky Way was the first radio source to be detected. It contains a number of radio sources, including Sagittarius A, the compact region around the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, as well as the black hole itself. When flaring, the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole lights up, detectable in radio waves. 

In the 2000s, three Galactic Center Radio Transients (GCRTs) were detected: GCRT J1746–2757, GCRT J1745–3009, and
GCRT J1742–3001. In addition, ASKAP J173608.2-321635, which was detected six times in 2020, may be a fourth GCRT.

;Region around the Galactic Center
In 2021, astronomers reported the detection of peculiar, highly circularly polarized intermittent radio waves from near the Galactic Center whose unidentified source could represent a new class of astronomical objects with a GCRT so far not &quot;fully explain[ing] the observations&quot;.

===Supernova remnants===
Supernova remnants often show diffuse radio emission. Examples include Cassiopeia A, the brightest extrasolar radio source in the sky, and the Crab Nebula.

===Neutron stars===

====Pulsars====

Supernovae sometimes leave behind dense spinning neutron stars called pulsars. They emit jets of charged particles which emit synchrotron radiation in the radio spectrum. Examples include the Crab Pulsar, the first pulsar to be discovered. Pulsars and quasars (dense central cores of extremely distant galaxies) were both discovered by radio astronomers. In 2003 astronomers using the Parkes radio telescope discovered two pulsars orbiting each other, the first such system known.

====Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) Sources ====
Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are a type of neutron stars discovered in 2006 by a team led by Maura McLaughlin from the Jodrell Bank Observatory at the University of Manchester in the UK. RRATs are believed to produce radio emissions which are very difficult to locate, because of their transient nature. Early efforts have been able to detect radio emissions (sometimes called RRAT flashes) for less than one second a day, and, like with other single-burst signals, one must take great care to distinguish them from terrestrial radio interference. Distributing computing and the Astropulse algorithm may thus lend itself to further detection of RRATs.

===Star forming regions===
Short radio waves are emitted from complex molecules in dense clouds of gas where stars are giving birth.

Spiral galaxies contain clouds of neutral hydrogen and carbon monoxide which emit radio waves. The radio frequencies of these two molecules were used to map a large portion of the Milky Way galaxy.

==Sources: extra-galactic==
===Radio galaxies===
Many galaxies are strong radio emitters, called radio galaxies. Some of the more notable are Centaurus A and Messier 87.

Quasars (short for &quot;quasi-stellar radio source&quot;) were one of the first point-like radio sources to be discovered. Quasars&#x27; extreme redshift led us to conclude that they are distant active galactic nuclei, believed to be powered by black holes. Active galactic nuclei have jets of charged particles which emit synchrotron radiation. One example is 3C 273, the optically brightest quasar in the sky.

Merging galaxy clusters often show diffuse radio emission.

===Cosmic microwave background===

The cosmic microwave background is blackbody background radiation left over from the Big Bang (the rapid expansion, roughly 13.8 billion years ago, that was the beginning of the universe.

=== Extragalactic pulses - Fast Radio Burst ===

D. R. Lorimer and others analyzed archival survey data and found a 30-jansky dispersed burst, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3° from the Small Magellanic Cloud. They reported that the burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. In a recent paper, they argue that current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 gigaparsec distant. The fact that no further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence (fusion) of relativistic objects. It is suggested that hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes. Radio pulsar surveys such as Astropulse-SETI@home offer one of the few opportunities to monitor the radio sky for impulsive burst-like events with millisecond durations. Because of the isolated nature of the observed phenomenon, the nature of the source remains speculative. Possibilities include a black hole-neutron star collision, a neutron star-neutron star collision, a black hole-black hole collision, or some phenomenon not yet considered.

In 2010 there was a new report of 16 similar pulses from the Parkes Telescope which were clearly of terrestrial origin, but in 2013 four pulse sources were identified that supported the likelihood of a genuine extragalactic pulsing population.

These pulses are known as &quot;fast radio bursts&quot; (FRBs). The first observed burst has become known as the &quot;Lorimer burst&quot;. Blitzars are one proposed explanation for them.

==Sources: not yet observed==
===Primordial black holes===
According to the Big Bang Model, during the first few moments after the Big Bang, pressure and temperature were extremely great. Under these conditions, simple fluctuations in the density of matter may have resulted in local regions dense enough to create black holes. Although most regions of high density would be quickly dispersed by the expansion of the universe, a primordial black hole would be stable, persisting to the present.

One goal of Astropulse is to detect postulated mini black holes that might be evaporating due to &quot;Hawking radiation&quot;. Such mini black holes are postulated to have been created during the Big Bang, unlike currently known black holes. Martin Rees has theorized that a black hole, exploding via Hawking radiation, might produce a signal that&#x27;s detectable in the radio. The Astropulse project hopes that this evaporation would produce radio waves that Astropulse can detect. The evaporation wouldn&#x27;t create radio waves directly. Instead, it would create an expanding fireball of high-energy gamma rays and particles. This fireball would interact with the surrounding magnetic field, pushing it out and generating radio waves.

=== ET ===

Previous searches by various &quot;search for extraterrestrial intelligence&quot; (SETI) projects, starting with Project Ozma, have looked for extraterrestrial communications in the form of narrow-band signals, analogous to our own radio stations. The Astropulse project argues that since we know nothing about how ET might communicate, this might be a bit closed-minded. Thus, the Astropulse Survey can be viewed as complementary to the narrow-band SETI@home survey as a by-product of the search for physical phenomena.

===Other undiscovered phenomena ===
Explaining their discovery in 2005 of a powerful bursting radio source, NRL astronomer Dr. Joseph Lazio stated: &quot;Amazingly, even though the sky is known to be full of transient objects emitting at X- and gamma-ray wavelengths, very little has been done to look for radio bursts, which are often easier for astronomical objects to produce.&quot; The use of coherent dedispersion algorithms and the computing power provided by the SETI network may lead to discovery of previously undiscovered phenomena.

He has a sister, Elizabeth, and through his father&#x27;s marriage to his stepmother, actress Rita Wilson, he has two younger half-brothers, Chester &quot;Chet&quot; and Truman.

Hanks attended Sacramento Country Day School, and then Chapman University, before transferring to Loyola Marymount University. He left without earning a degree.

==Career==

In 1999, Hanks was cast as Alex Whitmann in the science-fiction series &quot;Roswell&quot;, where he appeared for the first two seasons (making a brief appearance in the third). During that time, he acted in the teen comedies &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; with Shane West and &quot;Get Over It&quot; with Ben Foster. Hanks also made an appearance in an episode of &quot;The OC&quot;. He appeared in part eight of HBO mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; as Lt. Hank Jones. In 2002, he starred in his first film as Shaun Brumder in &quot;Orange County&quot;, alongside Jack Black and Schuyler Fisk. The comedy features Hanks&#x27; character trying to get into Stanford University after his guidance counselor mistakenly sends out the wrong transcript.

In 2005, he appeared in the remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;, playing the assistant to Jack Black&#x27;s character. In 2006, Hanks had a cameo role in Black&#x27;s &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;, playing a drunken fraternity brother. He starred in the romantic comedy &quot;The House Bunny&quot; in 2008, playing Oliver, a charming manager of a nursing home and the love interest of Anna Faris&#x27; character. In 2008, Hanks began work as director on &quot;All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records&quot;, a documentary about Tower Records which ultimately premiered on March 17, 2015, at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. The film received funding of nearly $100,000 through a Kickstarter campaign.

In 2009, Hanks appeared in &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot;, which was produced by his father and also starred John Malkovich. He also played Father Gill, a young Roman Catholic priest, in season 2 of the TV show &quot;Mad Men&quot;. In 2009, he made his Broadway debut, acting alongside Jane Fonda in the Moisés Kaufman play &quot;33 Variations&quot;.

In 2014, he starred as Allison in the second season of the web series &quot;Burning Love&quot;. The same year, he also portrayed Dr. Malcolm Perry in the historical film &quot;Parkland&quot;. In 2015, he played Officer Gus Grimly in the FX television series &quot;Fargo&quot;, for which he received Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award and Primetime Emmy Award nominations. In 2014, Hanks began a voice role in the show &quot;Talking Tom &amp; Friends&quot;. He voices Talking Tom, the main character.

In 2018, Hanks appears as the adult Alex Vreeke in the film &quot;&quot;, a role he would later reprise in the film&#x27;s 2019 sequel, &quot;&quot;. In 2019, Hanks portrays a young Fred Rogers on the Comedy Central show &quot;Drunk History&quot;. The same year, Hanks appears as a guest judge on Netflix&#x27;s baking competition &quot;Sugar Rush&quot; in the episode &quot;Sweet Geeks&quot;.

Hanks dated Busy Philipps in the 1990s while in college. In June 2009, Hanks became engaged to former New York publicist Samantha Bryant. The couple married on May 8, 2010, in Los Angeles. Together, they have two daughters, one born in 2011, and the other born in 2013.

Hanks is a San Francisco Giants baseball fan and attended their World Series-clinching victory in Texas in November 2010. He also directed a &quot;30 for 30&quot; short, &quot;The Anti-Mascot&quot;, about their disastrous Crazy Crab stint in the 1980s. He is also a fan of Liverpool FC, the San Francisco 49ers, Sacramento Kings, and Los Angeles Kings.

<doc id="1146124" wikidata="Q5559366" url="?curid=1146124" title="Gibson Kente">
<text>Gibson Mthuthuzeli Kente (23 July 1932 – 7 November 2004) was a South African playwright, composer, director, and producer based in Soweto. He was known as the &quot;Father of Black Theatre&quot; in South Africa, and was one of the first writers to deal with life in the South African black townships. He produced 23 plays and television dramas between 1963 and 1992. He is also responsible for producing some of South Africa&#x27;s leading musicians. Many prominent artists, including Brenda Fassie, owe their first opportunities on stage to him.

==Early life and education==
Gibson Kente was born on 23 July 1932 in Duncan Village, Eastern Cape raised in Stutterheim by his mother. He was educated at Bethel Training College Seventh-Day Adventist college in Butterworth until he moved to Lovedale Training College to complete his matric. In 1956 Kente moved to Johannesburg to study social work at the Jan H. Hofmeyr School of Social Work.

He never completed his studies; instead he joined a group known as Union of South African Artists (Union Artists) who were based at Dorkay House in central Johannesburg. The Union Artists offered black performers in South Africa training, royalty contracts and fair payment.

==Career==
In 1963, Kente produced his first play, &quot;Manana, The Jazz Prophet&quot;, which featured celebrated musicians Caiphus Semenya and Letta Mbulu. The play focused on Manana, a gospel preacher and prophet, whose main concern was to bring everybody to the Christian faith. In 1966, he wrote the musical &quot;Sikalo&quot;, which blended African gospel and township jazz. The musical was performed at the University of the Witwatersrand Great Hall.

Kente&#x27;s plays were popular for using township popular culture, slang, fashion, and topical issue to reflect on daily life. His success with his first two plays motivated him to leave the Union Artists to start his own training centre and production company, GK Productions. He trained famous South African artists and entertainers such as Brenda Fassie, Nomsa Nene, and Mbongeni Ngema in the garage of his home in Dube, Soweto. Kente also wrote music for artists such as Miriam Makeba and Letta Mbulu.

Three of his plays drew criticism for being anti-apartheid (Segregation) and were banned: &quot;How Long&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot; and &quot;Too Late&quot;. He was jailed for one year in 1976 on conclusion of the filming of his play &quot;How Long&quot;. The film was never released and the master negative of the film was given to the National Film Board in Pretoria. The National Film, Video and Sound Archives is the current custodian of this film. First performed in 1975, his play one-act play &quot;Too Late&quot; was banned by the Publications Control Board because it dealt with the death of Ntanana, a crippled girl, through brutal police action and apartheid bureaucracy. Another of his plays &quot;I Believe&quot;, was also banned. Another famous piece is &quot;Mama and the load&quot;.

In 1989, his Soweto home was firebombed burning early scripts and records. The garage at his home served as rehearsal room, set construction workshop, training centre and storeroom for GK Productions. It is estimates that before his death, Kente wrote 23 plays and three television dramas.

Kente began his last play, &quot;The Call&quot;, when he was diagnosed HIV positive. It is a musical about a man living with HIV who brings hope to others with the disease.

==Recognition==
In 1997, the 30-seater Bra Gibson Kente Theatre was opened in Sharpeville. In 1998, the Civic Theatre presented a tribute to him called &quot;A Tribute to Gibson Kente&quot;.

Associate Professor Emeritus Rolf Solberg of Norway wrote an account of the playwright&#x27;s life and work in &quot;Bra Gib: Father of South Africa&#x27;s Township Theatre&quot;.

==Personal life==
He married Drum cover-girl Evelyn Nomathemba Kasi in 1969 and they had three children. They were divorced in 1979.

In 2003 he announced that he was HIV Positive. This public admission received praise from South African politicians, including Nelson Mandela. He was admitted into the care of a hospice in Soweto, where he was cared for until he died in his sleep on 7 November 2004.

<text>Brenda Vera Amelia Lupton-Christian (born 25 February 1953) is a political figure from the Pacific territory of the Pitcairn Islands. When her brother Steve Christian was removed from the office of mayor following the 2004 Pitcairn child sexual abuse trial, she served as interim mayor of the islands.

==Biography==
Christian was born and raised on Pitcairn and is the daughter of former island political leader Ivan Christian and his wife Verna Carlene &quot;Dobrey&quot; Young. She lived in the United Kingdom for a time, but returned to the island around 1999 and has served as the island&#x27;s sole police officer. Except for 2003, she has been a member of the Island Council continuously since 2000.

She stood for election in her own right, but in the special election held on 15 December, she was defeated by Jay Warren, the former Magistrate (whose office was renamed &quot;Mayor&quot; in 1999 following a constitutional revision). Her stated goal as mayor of the Pitcairn Islands was to make the islands a more attractive destination for tourism.

In 2004 Brenda Christian served the territory as its first female Mayor from 8 November to 15 December 2004. She was appointed to the Mayoralty in an interim capacity by the Island Council, following her brother Steve Christian&#x27;s dismissal by the colonial Governor, in the wake of his child rape convictions on 30 October 2004.

<doc id="1146130" wikidata="Q5467936" url="?curid=1146130" title="Ford straight-six engine">
<text>The Ford Motor Company produced straight-six engines from 1906 until 1908 and from 1941 until 2016. In 1906, the first Ford straight-six was introduced in the Model K. The next was introduced in the 1941 Ford. Ford continued producing straight-six engines for use in its North American vehicles until 1996, when they were discontinued in favor of more compact V6 designs.

Ford Australia also manufactured straight-six engines in Australia for the Falcon and Territory models until 2016, when both vehicle lines were discontinued. Following the closure of the Australian engine plant, Ford no longer produces a straight-six gasoline engine.

== First generation ==

The first-generation Ford six-cylinder engines were all flatheads. They were the G- and H-series engines of used in cars and trucks and the M-series of used in larger Ford trucks and for industrial applications.

===226===
Introduced for the 1941 model year, the first Ford L-6 (designated G-series) displaced and produced , the same as the Flathead V-8 that year. Like the V-8, it was also a flathead or L-head engine. In 1948, Ford raised the compression of the flathead six or L-6 (designated H-series or Rouge 226) so that it generated and of torque. The G- and H-series engines were used in the full-sized Ford cars and trucks to replace the smaller Flathead V8 that was used in the 1937 Ford. Ford discontinued production of the H-series engine for the 1951 model year.

===254===
A version of the L-6 (designated the M-series or Rouge 254) was used from 1950 to 1953 in F6-series Ford trucks (COE, dump, truck-tractor, etc.), and small Ford school buses. The M-series engine produced and of torque. They were also used in miscellaneous industrial applications, e.g., to power water pumps for irrigation purposes and within vineyards to manage risk by powering giant frost-control propellers on stands in the middle of rows of grapes.

==Second generation==

The second generation was a newly designed inline-six, produced from 1952 through 1964; it shared many parts with Ford Y-blocks such as the entire valve train and the problems associated with the Y-block&#x27;s lubrication system. These engines have the exhaust and intake on the driver&#x27;s side and the distributor on the passenger side. It is referred to as Mileage Maker or I-Block Mileage Maker (with the &quot;I&quot; referring to &quot;inline&quot;) in the passenger cars and Cost Clipper in the trucks.

===215===
A completely new OHV I-6 was offered for the 1952–53 F-Series. It displaced and produced . It was also used in the 1952–53 Ford full-sized cars.

===223===
The 215 grew to for the 1954 F-Series. Output was now in the trucks and in the 1954 Ford cars. Power was up to in the 1956 trucks. While not the popular engine option, the 223 was the only inline-six offered in the Fairlane (until 1961), Galaxie, and F-Series trucks between 1955 and 1964, causing it to be not quite a rarity, but not easy to come across. The 223 was also used in 1963–1964 Ford trucks, which also used the Autolite 1100 carburetor with stamping C4TF-E and produced with 206 ft-lb of torque, and Mercury Meteor-Monterey in 1961. The 223 was also used in Onan 30EC generator sets and possibly others.

===262===
A I-6 version was also produced. The 262 I-6 was built from 1961 to 1964 for use in medium- and heavy-duty Ford trucks. This engine was also used for industrial applications.

==Third generation==

The third generation was produced at the Lima Engine plant in Lima, Ohio, from 1960 through 1984. Officially dubbed the Thriftpower Six, this engine line is sometimes referred to as the Falcon Six.

===144===

The inline-six engine was first introduced in the 1960 Ford Falcon. The 144 was made from 1960 through 1964 and averaged during the production run. While not known for being powerful or a stout engine, it proved to be economical and could get fairly good gas mileage for the time, up to . This small six was the basis for all the Ford &quot;Falcon&quot; straight-six engines. The intake manifold on this series was cast integrally with the cylinder head (this design was also used by Chevrolet with some of their later third-generation inline-sixes, the older engines had separate manifolds); as a result, they could not be easily modified for greater power. This engine had four main bearings and can be identified by the three core plugs on the side of the block.
This engine was used in:
* 1960–1964 Ford Falcon
* 1960–1964 Ford Ranchero
* 1960–1964 Mercury Comet
* 1961–1964 Ford E-Series (Econoline)

=== 170===
In 1961, the became an option for the Falcon and Comet lines. The 170 Special Six was a stroked version of the 144, increasing the stroke from . The original 1965 Ford Mustang used a version from March (production start) through July 1964. The Econoline van and Ford Bronco received a heavier-duty version with mechanical valve lifters. This engine had four main bearings and can be identified by the three core plugs on the side of the block. The 170 Special was dropped from production in 1972.

As used in the Argentinian-made Ford Falcon from 1962 until 1970, this engine produced at 4400 rpm.

===187===
From 1965 to 1969, Ford Argentina produced a specific block similar to the earlier , with four main bearings and a stroke) but with a bore. It was replaced by the from 1969. Power was rated at .

===200===
The inline-six model was introduced in the middle of 1963 with bore and stroke, and shared the four main bearing design of the 170. Early 200s can be identified by three core plugs. Beginning in 1965, the 200s were upgraded to seven main bearings to reduce harmonic vibrations and increase durability. The 1965 and later engines can be identified by four core plugs and the casting code C5DE-H. The 1965 Mustang (August 1964 onward) used this engine as standard, rated at . The Mustang continued to use the 200 as its base engine until it was dropped in 1971. Starting in 1966, a six-bolt bellhousing flange block was introduced. Beginning in 1980, one version of the 200 block was redesigned with a bell housing flange and a low-mount starter very similar to the low-mount starter 250 inline-six. This version is easily identified by starter location down by the oil pan rail and is referred to as the Big Bell 200. The big bell design is uncommon, but sought after by I-6 performance enthusiasts because it can be modified to accept a Ford small block V8 six bolt bell housing. There were concurrent high-mount starter 200 blocks made till 1983 model year, and they are more common than low-mount starter 200s.

When Ford launched the third-generation Fox body Mustang in 1979, the original engine lineup included the Cologne V6. The same engine was also offered in the hugely successful Ford of Europe Capri Mk II. The 2.8 L V6 engine was a popular option for the US Mustang and the European Capri Mk II, and as a result, the Cologne engine plant could not meet the demand for engines for both continents. As a result, the Cologne 2.8 L V6 was dropped from the Mustang&#x27;s engine lineup in the middle of the 1979 production year and replaced with the 200 Falcon inline-six, which was then referred to as the 3.3 L engine. The engine and front suspension K-member were transferred from the Fairmont, which helped reduce costs instead of having to redesign the Mustang for a different engine.

The 200 was used in the Ford Maverick and Mercury Comet and continued in the Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr until they were discontinued at the end of the 1983 model year. The 1975–80 Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch offered the 200 inline-six as the standard engine. For 1981–82 the Ford Granada was redesigned and common with an expanded line of Mercury Cougars which used the 200 inline-six as the standard engine. From mid-year 1980 through 1982 the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar XR-7 used the 200 inline-six as the standard engine. The Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, introduced in 1983 as the successors to the Granada and Cougar (non-XR7 models), carried over the 200 engine until it was replaced by the 3.8L Essex V6 for 1984.

Ford was also having problems meeting demand for its 2.3 L OHC engine, which was used in a multitude of models worldwide. In anticipation of another engine shortage, the Ford engine plant in Lima, Ohio, which was already producing the 2.3-liter OHC engine, decided they could modify the Falcon inline six block casting molds to remove cylinders 4 and 5 to create a four-cylinder engine. A cast-iron high-swirl cylinder head was developed, and the new 2.3 L engine was designated the HSC to differentiate it from the same displacement 2.3 L OHC design. This engine shared many common parts with the 200, and it is common for persons rebuilding their 200 engines to use the 2.3 L HSC pistons as a cheap replacement.

===250===
The inline-six engine was offered in 1969 in the Mustang, and 1970 in compact Ford cars (Maverick). The 250 was a stroked 200, made by increasing the stroke from . Output was in the Mustang, and the 250 became the base engine in 1971. The Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch offered the 250 inline-six for the 1975–1980 model years, when it was replaced by the 200 inline-six.

Power was re-evaluated at for 1972 (because of power rating changes) and the next year. This engine had seven main bearings, and can be identified by the five core plugs on the side of the block. The block uses a low-mount starter and six bellhousing bolts, sharing its bellhousing pattern with the 302 and 351 Windsor V8s, late (1965–68) 289, early 4.6 L V8, and the 240 and 300 inline-six. Production of the 250 ended in 1980.

==Fourth generation==
Produced at the Cleveland Engine plant in Brook Park, Ohio, from 1965 through 1996, the 240 and 300 inline-six engines are well known for their durability. These engines employed seven main bearings and used long-wearing timing gears instead of a chain or belt.

Both the 240 and the 300, no matter the application, used a single-barrel Autolite 1100/1101 (or Carter YF/A) carburetor until the introduction of electronic fuel injection in 1987. With proper gearing, many F-Series trucks and Broncos achieve . This fact was heavily used by Ford&#x27;s advertising campaign (some television advertisements and written literature even claimed ), since the V8 engines in these trucks rarely achieved over .

The fuel economy of the 300 makes the engine a popular choice among truck enthusiasts that want both power and economy. The addition of performance parts (such as intake and exhaust manifolds with a four-barrel carburetor) place the engine power output near the same levels as the stock &quot;HO&quot; (High Output) version of the optional 351 V8.

===240===
The inline-six for 1965–1972 full-sized cars (continued to 1974 in fleet models) and 1965–1974 trucks and vans produced (gross). In stationary service (generators and pumps) fueled by LPG or natural gas, this engine is known as the CSG-639. The 240 had a bore of and a stroke of .

===300===
The six was first offered in the F-Series for 1965. It is essentially a with a longer stroke of . The two engines are nearly identical; the differences are in the rotating assembly and combustion chamber sizes in the head (the heads are interchangeable). It produced (gross). The 300 became the base F-Series engine in 1978 at (horsepower number changes due to Ford switching to net power ratings in 1971). Power outputs were increased to roughly during the early 1980s, before fuel injection was introduced. This became the primary engine of the line, eclipsing the 240. Unlike the Falcon engine, it featured separate intake and exhaust manifolds, which could be easily replaced with aftermarket manifolds offering the promise of even more power, through the installation of larger carburetors and a higher flowing exhaust system.

Also during the late 1960s and early 1970s, the 300 was used in larger vehicles such as dump trucks, many weighing into the to range. These engines were equipped with a higher flow HD (Heavy Duty) exhaust manifold and forged crankshafts and rods, as the engines would be constantly working in the 3,000–4,000 rpm range. Due to their high-flowing design, enthusiasts often seek these manifolds out because they allow turbochargers to be easily retrofitted to the engine.

Beginning in 1978, the engine displacement was advertised in metric, becoming &quot;4.9 L.&quot; Fuel injection and other changes in 1987 increased output to with an 8.8:1 compression ratio. Even though this engine was renowned for its durability, low-end torque, and ease of service, it was gradually phased out. Production ended in 1996, making it the last inline-six gasoline engine offered in a Ford car or light truck in North America. It was replaced by the 4.2 L Essex V6 for 1997 in the redesigned F-150, as well as the E-150 and E-250.

The 300 was mated to the Ford C6, E4OD, and AOD automatic transmissions, and the Mazda M5OD, ZF S5-42 and S5-47, 5-speed manual transmissions, and the Borg-Warner T18, Tremec RTS, and New Process NP435 4-speed manual transmissions.

Race car driver Scott Donohue raced a rally truck with a Ford 300 inline-six in it and won the Baja 1000 three times. This engine is also used by Stewart &amp; Stevenson in the MA Baggage Tow Tractor, and Harlan in their standard tow tractors, as well as a multitude of other pieces of equipment, such as ski lifts, power generators, wood chippers, tractors, and, until they converted to diesel engines, most UPS trucks. In stationary service (generators and pumps) fueled with LPG or natural gas, this engine is known as the CSG-649.

Applications:
*1965–1996 Ford F-Series (F-100, F-150, F-250, F-350, and F-600)
*1968–1996 Ford E-Series (E-100, E-150, E-250, and E-350)
*1980–1992 Ford Bronco

==Ford Australia==

With local production of the Ford Falcon starting in 1960, Ford Australia began to offer the same inline-six engines as offered in North America. In Australia, the engine underwent significant updates to its design over the following decades, including a move to a crossflow layout, electronic ignition, alloy cylinder heads, fuel injection, overhead camshaft and later multi-valve double overhead camshaft design, variable intake runners, variable valve timing, and ultimately turbocharging. It remained in production for 56 years, retaining the same bore centres of the original 1960 Falcon engine throughout its evolution.

===144, 170, and 200, 3.1 and 3.6 litre===
Initially, the 144 and 170 cu in &#x27;Pursuit&#x27; engines were offered. The 200 cu in &#x27;Super Pursuit&#x27; engine option added in February 1964 with the introduction of the XM Falcon, at which time the 144 and 170 underwent changes to cylinder head, camshaft and exhaust design that increased their outputs to and respectively. In 1965, all three engines received a revised camshaft for increased low-speed performance with the introduction of the XP Falcon. The 144 remained in production until the late 1966 introduction of the larger, second generation XR Falcon. 

In 1968, coinciding with the release of the XT Falcon, the deck height of the design was increased to make room for increased crankshaft stroke, resulting in displacements of 188 and 221 cu in (badged 3.1 and 3.6 litres). These engines featured a seven-bearing crankshaft and shared a common bore, with strokes of respectively. They superseded the 170 and 200 engines in the Australian Falcon lineup. The 188 and 221 also powered the Argentine Falcon range from 1970 to 1991.

===200 and 250===
In , in conjunction with the release of the XY Falcon, Ford Australia enlarged capacities to 200 and 250 cu in., reverting to imperial cubic inch measurements for identification. Bore and stroke dimensions for the Australian engines were identical to their US counterparts of the same capacities, but the structure of the engine was different; both Australian engines shared a common block with the crankshaft positioned lower in the block to accommodate the longer stroke of the 250, whereas the US 250 engines had increased deck height. The head was of similar design to previous models, with an integral intake catering for a single-barrel Bendix-Stromberg carburettor. Outputs for the 200 and 250 cu in. engines were rated at and respectively. From September 1972 both 200 and 250 cu in variants also became available on locally manufactured Ford Cortinas, and by 1974 the 250 was now the standard engine for the locally-assembled Ford F series truck range. 

As a performance option for the XY Falcon and subsequent XA Falcon, Ford developed the 2V (two-venturi) variant of the 250 cu in. engine. The cylinder head, which in all respects was similar to the previous integral &quot;log head&quot; intake, with the exception of a removable aluminium intake which mounted a Bendix-Stromberg WW two-barrel carburettor. To take advantage of the much improved breathing ability that the removable intake brought to the new head, the 250-2V also featured a better-breathing exhaust manifold. Output was rated at , and road tests noted a reduction in 0 to acceleration time from 14 to 10.7 seconds over a Falcon equipped with the standard single-barrel 250 cu in. engine. For years, the 250-2V cylinder head was very popular for racing and many have been imported to North America, where owners of cars with the Falcon inline six have upgraded their engines with the higher-performance cylinder head.

===Crossflow, Alloy Head, Alloy Head II and EFI===
From 1 July , new emission standards came into effect with Australian Design Rule 27A, which set limits for the emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. To meet the new requirements, compression ratios were dropped, and the engines now featured an exhaust gas recirculation valve and positive crankcase ventilation. In an effort to maintain horsepower outputs, Ford Australia updated the engines with a new cast-iron crossflow head design with larger, canted valves, and an aluminium water-heated intake manifold to improve gas flow and warm-up. Only the block, crankshaft, pistons and conrods were carried over from the old engine. Whereas the previous integral &quot;log head&quot; engine borrowed from the Ford FE engine family design, the new crossflow engine borrowed from the Cleveland V8 family, which was manufactured alongside the straight six at Ford Australia&#x27;s Geelong Engine Plant. Introduced with the XC Falcon, engine displacements remained 200 and 250 cu in, but were now badged 3.3 and 4.1 litres, respectively, and power and torque outputs were expressed in metric units. While quoted power outputs dropped from for the 3.3, and from for the 4.1, power was now measured using the DIN rather than SAE gross method. Ford claimed the new crossflow engines had a performance gain of approximately ten per cent over their reverse-flow XB Falcon predecessors, which were rated at and respectively when tested to the same DIN method. 

With the introduction of the 1979 XD Falcon, changes to compression ratio, ignition advance and revisions to port design for improved gas flow saw modest increases to power and torque outputs. In June 1980, Ford Australia updated the crossflow design with a new aluminium head casting developed in conjunction with Honda, and introduced electronic ignition. Dubbed Alloy Head and introduced as part of a mid-life update of the XD Falcon, the revised engines featured a high-swirl, lean-burn combustion chamber design that enabled higher compression ratios to be used while still meeting emissions requirements. The use of aluminium alloy meant that the engines were lighter, and had improved warm-up time. Power outputs for the 3.3 and 4.1 litre engines now raised to and respectively, with reductions in fuel consumption of seven to ten per cent. Until 1982, the engines were fitted with a single-barrel Bendix-Stromberg carburettor, but with the introduction of the XE Falcon from March 1982, both 3.3 and 4.1 litre engines were fitted with a Weber two-stage carburettor. It featured two venturi, with the second venturi coming into operation only when the first venturi opening exceeded two-thirds. Power outputs for the new engines, designated Alloy Head II, increased to and respectively, and fuel economy improved over that of the previous Alloy Head engines with single-barrel carburettor.

In March 1983, direct-port fuel injection using Bosch Jetronic LE was offered as an option on the 4.1 L engine. With the release of the XF Falcon the following year, the injected 4.1 was upgraded with Ford&#x27;s EEC-IV engine management system with Multi Point Electronic Fuel Injection (MP-EFI). Changes to the carburettor-based engine were made to accommodate the EFI system. The cylinder head intake ports had been modified to provide clearance for the injectors, and a new intake manifold was designed and many other changes were made in the engine bay to accommodate the new fuel system.

In response to Australian Design Rule 37, which required all new cars sold after 1 January 1986 to operate with unleaded petrol, Falcon engines were modified for running on regular grade 91 RON unleaded fuel and equipped with catalytic converters. Despite revisions that included a higher-lift camshaft and revised combustion chamber shape, power and torque outputs for the carburetted 3.3 and 4.1 litre engines fell to and , although maximum power output from the 4.1 EFI engine increased slightly to . While the OHV six-cylinder engines were replaced by OHC variants across the Ford Australia passenger car range in 1988, the carburetted 4.1 litre engine remained in production until 1993 along with the ute and panel van variants of the XF Falcon for which it was the only engine offered.

===OHC and Intech===
 In , the inline six engines underwent a major redesign for the EA26 Falcon and now featured a new single overhead cam (SOHC) crossflow aluminium head. Two engine sizes were offered, based on a common cylinder bore. The smaller engine, dubbed 3.2 litre, featured a stroke and a swept volume of . The larger engine, dubbed 3.9 litre, shared the stroke of the previous 4.1 litre engine for a swept volume of . Electronic fuel injection was now used across with range, with the 3.2 litre engine equipped with throttle body injection, and the 3.9 litre engine available with a choice of throttle body injected or multipoint fuel injected variants.

The updated design featured camshaft and auxiliary shafts driven by a duplex chain, and chain rive to the distributor and the oil pump shafts. The camshaft was supported on the cylinder head by using &#x27;topless&#x27; bearings; bearing liners were not used. The camshaft was held in position using valve spring pressure, with hydraulic lash adjusters mounted on the rocker arms were used to provide zero valve lash. 

By late 1988, the 3.2 litre engine was no longer competitive against the base engine option offered in the newly-released Holden Commodore and was discontinued by the end of that year, leaving the two 3.9 litre engines as the only choices. In 1992, in conjunction with a mid-life update of the EB Falcon, the cylinder bore was increased to , increasing swept volume to . Dubbed 4.0 litre and now available only with multipoint fuel injection, the engine was rated at . 

During 1992, a high output variant of the 4.0 litre engine, featuring a modified cylinder head and camshaft developed by Tickford Vehicle Engineering, was introduced. Fitted to the sports-oriented Falcon S-XR6 (renamed Falcon XR6 with the updated ED Falcon in 1993) it developed , only less than the optional 5.0 litre V8 also offered with the EB and ED Falcon.

In conjunction with the release of the EF Falcon range in 1994, Ford introduced a dual resonance intake manifold aimed at providing greater low-speed torque, branding the system Computer Torque Control. While the torque peak of the standard engine increased by only to , Ford claimed that mid-range torque was now as much as higher. Power increased to for the standard engine, and for the high-output XR6 variant. The engine management system was upgraded to Ford&#x27;s EEC V, and the distributor was replaced by a three-coil ignition system with each coil firing two spark plugs. However, the subsequent EL Falcon reverted to a distributor/coil ignition setup.
Ford Australia redesigned the I-6 again, naming it the Intech, in 1998 alongside the introduction of the Ford Falcon (AU), and increased the main bearing size and added a ladder style main stud girdle integral with the oil pan to increase low end rigidity. The engine also received variable camshaft timing technology in some XR6 models, Fairlane/LTD models and the Fairmont Ghia which allowed the ECU to advance or retard camshaft timing depending on engine speed, which results in a broader power band. The Composite Headgasket from the previous models was replaced with a Multi-Layer-Steel (MLS) gasket. Power outputs for the base model Falcon Forte, Fairmont, and the standard XR6 were unchanged from their EL series predecessors, but a new XR6 VCT model was offered. The Fairmont Ghia, Fairlane and LTD models were also equipped with a variant of the VCT engine.

===Barra===

In , the engine underwent a significant upgrade receiving dual overhead cams (DOHC) with variable cam timing and coil-on-plug ignition. The engine gained the nickname &quot;Barra&quot;, named after the &quot;Barramundi&quot; code name used during the development of the Ford Falcon (BA), and a numerical suffix was used to identify the engine variant by its output in kilowatts. Producing and in Barra 182 form, it debuted in the Ford Falcon (BA) of 2002 and also powered the Ford Territory introduced in 2004. In October 2005, alongside the introduction of the Ford Falcon (BF) and Ford Territory (SY), these outputs rose to and . In 2008 the Barra was upgraded a final time, debuting in the Ford Falcon (FG) with power outputs of and .

Turbocharged versions were also manufactured. The initial version, known as Barra 240T with and of torque was offered between 2002 and 2005 in the BA Falcon XR6 Turbo, as well as the Territory Turbo. This was followed in the BF and BF Mk II XR6 Turbo (between 2005 and 2008) by the Barra 245T producing of power and of torque, which in turn was followed by the Barra 270T from 2008-2016 in the FG and FG X XR6 Turbo and G6E Turbo models producing of power and of torque.

Ford Australia&#x27;s high-performance division, Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV), created even more powerful turbocharged variants. The first turbocharged straight six-engined car from FPV was the BA Mk II F6 Typhoon (2004), which produced of power and of torque. The first power and torque upgrade came with the FG range of 2008, which saw outputs rise to of power at 5500 rpm and of torque. This engine, the Barra 310T, was the first Australian-built engine to achieve over per litre.

The ultimate iteration of the Barra engine was installed in the limited-production FG X XR6 Sprint (limited to 500 units) of 2016. This engine produced at 6000 rpm and at 2750 rpm. The engine features an overboost function that can increase output to and for up to ten seconds.

Ford Australia had intended to discontinue production of the straight six engine at their engine plant in Geelong in 2010 and replace it in the Falcon and Territory models with an imported V6 engine, although later reversed this decision in favour of upgrading the Barra to meet then-upcoming Euro IV emissions standards. This would prove to be only a temporary stay of execution as the Geelong factory eventually closed on 26 September 2016, following Ford&#x27;s decision in May 2013 to discontinue the Falcon and Territory and cease manufacture of vehicles in Australia. The last Australian-built Ford, and the last Ford passenger vehicle to be fitted with a straight-six engine, rolled off the production line at the Broadmeadows Assembly Plant on 7 October 2016. It was a Kinetic Blue FG X Falcon XR6 sedan, equipped with the naturally-aspirated Barra 195 straight six engine.

<text>Gareth Keenan (born 17 April 1971) is a fictional paper salesman on the BBC&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Office&quot;, portrayed by Mackenzie Crook. Gareth is a self-important team leader proud of his alleged Lieutenant status in the Territorial Army. He spends his days annoying his co-workers at Wernham Hogg with his rigid enforcement of the rules and sycophantic attitude towards David Brent, whom he views as a friend. Gareth describes his job title as &quot;Assistant Regional Manager&quot;, but Brent often corrects this to &quot;Assistant &quot;to the&quot; Regional Manager&quot;. His counterpart on the US series is Dwight Schrute. The character was originally meant to be a tough military character but, after Crook&#x27;s audition, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant decided to reinterpret the character.

Mackenzie Crook had mixed feelings about the character in 2021; saying: &quot;He was a bit of a monster.&quot;

== Characteristics ==

Gareth flaunts his &quot;team leader&quot; status, despite his desk mate, Tim Canterbury, highlighting that it is a meaningless title simply entailing more responsibility for the same pay. Nonetheless, Gareth takes the job very seriously. His attempts to throw his inflated sense of authority around the office rarely work, and it is clear that no one pays any attention to him. He does display certain concerns for his workers, mostly regarding health and safety matters. Tim plays numerous pranks on Gareth, such as hiding his computer, putting his stapler in jelly (a prank that has been reprised in several other versions of &quot;The Office&quot;, including the US version), gluing his phone so that the receiver cannot be picked up (and then calling him) and playing on Gareth&#x27;s naïveté by discussing warfare with language which could be interpreted as being homosexual in nature (e.g. &quot;the enemy has discovered your camp...and they&#x27;ve all entered your hole&quot;, &quot;taking a man from behind&quot; or &quot;could you give a man a lethal blow?&quot;). In the Christmas Special, Gareth has become manager, but Tim still plays practical jokes on him by stealing his keys and then locking him in his office.

Gareth constantly displays naivety and, like David Brent, can be unintentionally discriminatory. For example, Gareth attempts to disprove accusations of homophobia by mentioning that his CD collection includes George Michael, Pet Shop Boys and Queen, remarking that &quot;they&#x27;re all bummers&quot;; Queen features prominently among his favorite music. His favorite band of all time is Mike + The Mechanics, which is mentioned derisively by Tim in the bonus features of the series 2 DVD.

Wherever possible, Gareth constantly boasts about his military skills and how they might come in useful in an office environment, such as how to kill a man with a single blow. Despite his experience in the Territorial Army, however, he exhibits a selfish, egotistical nature and seems to be physically weak. It is quite probable Gareth inherited his love for the military life from his father, who was also involved in the army some years ago. Keenan also enjoys kung-fu films, and he drives a Triumph TR3 which he bought for £1,200 and restored. The vehicle is now believed by Gareth to be worth around £3,000. Gareth is also shown to have very little self-awareness, believing that his unthoughtful comments and occasional macho bravado are completely appropriate and will earn him the respect of his co-workers. His lack of self-awareness is also displayed when Tim and Dawn repeatedly insinuate homosexuality through questions about his military service without his understanding.

Despite the sturdy personality he displays, Gareth is surprisingly fragile and insecure underneath the surface. For example, when David announces he is leaving Wernham Hogg, the company in which the show takes place, Gareth breaks down in tears. Evidently, Gareth admires Brent and is eager to follow his lead. However, in the two episodes comprising the Christmas special he expresses strong disapproval of Brent&#x27;s laid-back, comical approach to management. Frequently comparing the mundane events that take place at Wernham Hogg with equivalent situations likely to occur on the battlefield, Gareth stresses the need for a shrewd, austere style of leadership. When impugning Brent&#x27;s injection of comedy into the workplace, he ridiculously attempts to justify his argument by suggesting that &quot;in a battle situation&quot; soldiers would be more likely to be inspired by a &quot;decisive, uncompromising leader&quot; than one who offered them jokes before their advance towards the enemy. Following Brent&#x27;s departure, Gareth is made regional manager of the branch, although he still seems to command little respect – Tim&#x27;s latest prank is to lock his boss in his office, requiring a desperate phone call to the receptionist&#x27;s desk to secure his release. Through his office window, Gareth tells Oliver that &quot;he&#x27;s locked me in again&quot;, suggesting to the audience that this is not the first time that Tim has played this prank on him.

On the social side, Gareth portrays himself as someone who can handle many pints and as somewhat of a ladies&#x27; man and does in fact enjoy some success with women (often in the local nightclub &quot;Chasers&quot;) but in contrast to Tim&#x27;s interest in Dawn, Gareth&#x27;s &quot;success&quot; with women is sexual in nature rather than romantic. His attempts to woo female co-workers are never successful. Generally, he is disliked in most quarters, due largely to his annoying and inappropriate behaviour, as well as his arrogance. He does, however, have several close friends, some of whom include &quot;Jimmy the Perv&quot; (who lives up to his name by repeatedly paying Dawn Tinsley for kisses for Comic Relief, with increasing lasciviousness each time), &quot;The Oggmonster&quot; (a very tall figure with astigmatism, played by &quot;The Office&quot; co-creator Stephen Merchant) and unseen characters known only by the nicknames &quot;Fish Fingers&quot; and &quot;Gobbler&quot;. At certain points, Tim and Gareth seem to make up and be friendly. However, those instances are quickly overshadowed by more practical jokes thrown at him by Tim and Dawn.

<text>The Ganz Machinery Works Holding is a Hungarian holding company. Its products are related to rail transport, power generation, and water supply, among other industries.

The original Ganz Works or Ganz ( or , &quot;Ganz companies&quot;, formerly &quot;Ganz and Partner Iron Mill and Machine Factory&quot;) operated between 1845 and 1949 in Budapest, Hungary. It was named after Ábrahám Ganz, the founder and manager of the company. Ganz is probably best known for the manufacture of tramcars, but was also a pioneer in the application of three-phase alternating current to electric railways.

Ganz also made ships (through its &quot;Ganz Danubius&quot; division), bridge steel structures (&quot;Ganz Acélszerkezet&quot;) and high-voltage equipment (&quot;Ganz Transelektro&quot;). In the early 20th century the company experienced its heyday and became the third-largest industrial enterprise in the Kingdom of Hungary after the &quot;Manfréd Weiss Steel and Metal Works&quot; and the &quot;MÁVAG&quot; company.

Since 1989, various parts of Ganz have been taken over by other companies.

== History ==

The company was founded by Ábrahám Ganz in 1844. He was invited to Pest, Hungary, by Count István Széchenyi and became the casting master at the &quot;Roller Mill Plant&quot; (referred to as &quot;Hengermalom&quot; in Hungarian). In 1854 he began manufacturing hard cast railroad wheels in his own plant founded in 1844. The management of the steam mill paid a share of the profit to Ganz. This enabled him to buy, in 1844, land and a house for 4500 Forints in Víziváros, Buda castle district. Abraham Ganz built his own foundry on this site and started to work there with seven assistants. They made mostly casting products for the needs of the people of the city.[3] In 1845, he bought the neighbouring site and expanded his foundry with a cupola furnace. He gave his brother, Henrik a job as a clerk, because of the growing administration work. He made a profit in the first year, and his factory grew, even though he had not yet engaged in mass production. In 1846, at the third Hungarian Industrywork Exhibition (Magyar Iparmű Kiállítás), he introduced his stoves to the public. He won the silver medal of the exhibition committee and the bronze medaille from Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary.

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 the foundry made ten cannons and many cannonballs for the Hungarian army. Because of this, the Military Court of Austria impeached him. He got seven weeks in prison as penalty, but because of his Swiss citizenship he was acquitted of the charge.[3]
Ganz recognized that, to develop his factory, he had to make products that were mass-produced. In 1846 the Pest-Vác railway line was built. At that time, European foundries made wrought iron rims for spoked wagon wheels by pouring the casts in shapes in sand, and leaving them to cool down. He successfully developed a railway wheel casting technology; it was the new method of &quot;crust-casting&quot; to produce cheap yet sturdy iron railway wheels, which greatly contributed to the rapid railway development in Central Europe. 86,074 pieces of hard cast wheels had been sold to 59 European railway companies until 1866. Consequently, this factory played an important role in building the infrastructure of the Hungarian Kingdom and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. At this time the agricultural machines, steam locomotives, pumps and the railway carriages were the main products. At the beginning of the 20th century, 60 to 80% of the factory&#x27;s products were sold for export.
After the death of Abraham Ganz, the heirs entrusted the management of the factory to his direct colleagues at Ganz Művek: Antal Eichleter, Ulrik Keller and Andreas Mechwart, which then took the name Ganz &amp; Co. The Ganz family sold the company, which consisted of five departments, and in April 1869 it was transformed into a joint-stock company, and continued its operations under the name of &quot;Ganz és Társa vasontöde és Gépgyár Rt.&quot; (Ganz &amp; Partners Iron Foundry and Machine Factory Co.) The technical director was András Mechwart, under whose direction Ganz became one of the most important groups of machine building companies in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy after 1869.

At the end of the 19th century, the products of the &quot;Ganz and Partner Iron Mill and Machine Factory&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Ganz Works&quot;) promoted the expansion of alternating-current power transmissions.

=== Prominent engineers ===



Prominent engineers at &quot;Ganz works&quot; included András Mechwart, Károly Zipernowsky, Miksa Déri, Ottó Titusz Bláthy, Kálmán Kandó, György Jendrassik and Ernő Wilczek.

===Revolution in the milling industry===
The invention of the modern industrial mill (the roller mill ) – by András Mechwart in 1874 – guaranteed a solid technological superiority and revolutionized the world&#x27;s milling industry. Budapest&#x27;s milling industry grow the second largest in the world, behind the American Minneapolis. The Hungarian grain export increased by 66% within some years.

===Power plants, generators turbines and transformers===

In 1878, the company&#x27;s general manager András Mechwart founded the Department of Electrical Engineering headed by Károly Zipernowsky. Engineers Miksa Déri and Ottó Bláthy also worked at the department producing direct-current machines and arc lamps.

In 1878, the company began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.

==== Generators ====
The first turbo generators were water turbines which drove electric generators. The first Hungarian water turbine was designed by engineers of the Ganz Works in 1866. Mass production of dynamo generators started in 1883.

The missing link of a full Voltage Sensitive/Voltage Intensive (VSVI) system was the reliable alternating current constant voltage generator. Therefore, the invention of the constant voltage generator by the Ganz Works in 1883 had a crucial role in the beginnings of industrial scale AC power generation, because only these type of generators can produce a stable output voltage, regardless of the actual load.

==== Transformers ====

In cooperation, Zipernovsky, Bláthy and Déri (known as the ZBD team) constructed and patented the transformer. The &quot;transformer&quot; was named by Ottó Titusz Bláthy. The three invented the first high efficiency, closed core shunt connection transformer. They also invented the modern power distribution system: Instead of a series of connections they connected supply transformers in parallel to the main line.

The transformer patents described two basic principles. Loads were to be connected in parallel, not in series as had been the general practice until 1885. Additionally, the inventors described the closed armature as an essential part of the transformer. Both factors assisted the stabilisation of voltage under varying load, and allowed definition of standard voltages for distribution and loads. The parallel connection and efficient closed core made construction of electrical distribution systems technically and economically feasible.

The Ganz Works built the first transformers using iron plating of enamelled mild iron wire, and started to use laminated cores to eliminate eddy currents

In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the company supplied, electrical equipment for the world&#x27;s first power station to use AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network. This was the Italian steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.

Following the introduction of the transformer, the Ganz Works changed over to production of alternating-current equipment. For instance, Rome&#x27;s electricity was supplied by hydroelectric plant and long-distance energy transfer.

==== Electricity meters ====
The first mass-produced kilowatt-hour meter (electricity meter), based on Hungarian Ottó Bláthy&#x27;s patent and named after him, was presented by the Ganz Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the company was marketing the first induction kilowatt-hour meter by the end of the year. These were the first alternating-current wattmeters, known by the name of Bláthy-meters.
==== Industrial refrigerators and air conditioners====
In 1894, Hungarian inventor and industrialist István Röck started to manufacture a large industrial ammonia refrigerator (together with the Esslingen Machine Works) which was powered by Ganz electric compressors. At the 1896 Millennium Exhibition, Röck and the Esslingen Machine Works presented a 6-tonne capacity artificial ice producing plant. In 1906, the first large Hungarian cold store (with a capacity of 3,000 tonnes, the largest in Europe) opened in Tóth Kálmán Street, Budapest, the machine was manufactured by the Ganz Works. Until nationalisation after the Second World War, large-scale industrial refrigerator production in Hungary was in the hands of Röck and Ganz Works.

The contract between Ganz and Egypt in the 1930s played a key role in the development of cooling equipment: railcars delivered to Egypt were equipped with air-conditioning cooling systems. The collective of the Ganz factory (machine designers: Gábor Hollerung, Rezső Oláh, István Pfeifer, Prónai) designed and built the 3-cylinder, 20 kW compressors with freon refrigerant, air condenser and evaporator. The machine could also be converted to heat pump operation.

=== ICE engines and vehicles ===
The beginning of gas engine manufacturing in Hungary is linked to Donát Bánki and János Csonka but it is not clear that they ever worked for Ganz.

Ganz produced engines whose designs were licensed to Western European partners, notably in the United Kingdom and Italy.

===Railways===

====Steam motors====

The Ganz Company started to construct steam locomotives and steam railcars from the 1860s.
Between 1901 and 1908, Ganz Works of Budapest and de Dion-Bouton of Paris collaborated to build a number of railcars for the Hungarian State Railways together with units with de Dion-Bouton boilers, Ganz steam motors and equipments, and Raba carriages built by the Raba Hungarian Wagon and Machine Factory in Győr. In 1908, the Borzsavölgyi Gazdasági Vasút (BGV), a narrow-gauge railway in Carpathian Ruthenia (today&#x27;s Ukraine), purchased five railcars from Ganz and four railcars from the Hungarian Royal State Railway Machine Factory with de Dion-Bouton boilers. The Ganz company started to export steam motor railcars to the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Japan, Russia and Bulgaria.

===== The World&#x27;s first electrified main railway line in Italy =====

The Ganz Works, having identified the significance of induction motors and synchronous motors, commissioned Kálmán Kandó to develop them. In 1894, Hungarian engineer Kálmán Kandó developed high-voltage three-phase AC motors and generators for electric locomotives. The first-ever electric rail vehicle manufactured by Ganz Works was a 6 HP pit locomotive with direct current traction system. The first Ganz made asynchronous rail vehicles (altogether 2 pieces) were supplied in 1898 to Évian-les-Bains (France) with a 37 HP asynchronous traction system. The Ganz Works won the tender for electrification of the Valtellina Railway in Italy in 1897. Under the management, and on the basis of plans from Kálmán Kandó, three phase electric power at 3 kV and 15 Hz was fed through two upper wires and the rails.
The electricity was produced in a dedicated power station and the system operated for thirty years from 1902. Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106 km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices. The three-phase two-wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as &quot;the Italian system&quot;. Kandó was invited in 1905 to undertake the management of Società Italiana Westinghouse and led the development of several Italian electric locomotives.

=====Invention of the Phase Converter=====
In 1918, Kandó invented and developed the rotary phase converter, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50 Hz) single phase AC of the high-voltage national networks.
After World War I, at the Ganz Works, Kálmán Kandó constructed a single-phase electric railway system using 16 kV at 50 Hz. A similar system, but using 15 kV at 16.7 Hz, later became widely used in Europe. The main attribute of Kandó&#x27;s 50 Hz system was that it was fed by the normal power network, so dedicated railway power stations became unnecessary. Because of the early death of Kálmán Kandó, László Verebélÿ continued the work for the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV).

==== Ganz-MÁVAG rail rolling stock ====
In 1959 Ganz merged with the MÁVAG company and was renamed Ganz-MÁVAG.
In 1976 Ganz-Mávag supplied ten standard gauge 3-car diesel trainset to the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE), designated as Class AA-91 and four metre gauge 4-car trainsets, designated as Class A-6451. In 1981/82 Ganz-Mávag supplied to OSE 11 B-B diesel-hydraulic DHM7-9 locomotives, designated as class A-251. Finally, in 1983, OSE bought eleven 3-car metre gauge trainsets, designated as Class A-6461. All these locomotives and trainsets have been withdrawn with the exception of one standard and one metre gauge trainset.

In 1982/83 Ganz-Mávag supplied an order for electric multiple units to New Zealand Railways Corporation for Wellington suburban services. The order was made in 1979, and was for 44 powered units and 44 trailer units, see New Zealand EM class electric multiple unit.
==== Ganz-MÁVAG Trams ====
Ganz-MÁVAG delivered 29 trams (2 car sets) to Alexandria, Egypt from 1985 to 1986.

===Shipbuilding, Ganz - Danubius===
In 1911, the Ganz Company merged with the Danubius shipbuilding company, which was the largest shipbuilding company in Hungary. From 1911, the unified company adopted the &quot;Ganz–Danubius&quot; brand name. In the beginning of the 20th century the company had 19 shipyards on the Danube and the Adriatic Sea in the city of Rijeka and Pula.
As Ganz Danubius, the company became involved in shipbuilding before, and during, World War I. Ganz was responsible for building the dreadnought , all of the &quot;Novara&quot;-class cruisers, and built diesel-electric U-boats at its shipyard in Budapest, for final assembly at Fiume. Several U-boats of the U-XXIX class, U-XXX class, U-XXXI class and U-XXXII class were completed, A number of other types were laid down, but remained incomplete at the war&#x27;s end. By the end of the First World War, 116 naval vessels had been built by The Ganz-Danubius company. The company also produces transatlantic ocean liners for passenger lines Trieste - New York, Trieste - Montevideo, as a reflection of already formed wave of mass migration from Central Europe to America.

===Aircraft===

The first Hungarian &quot;aeroplane factory&quot; ( UFAG ) was founded by the Ganz Company and Weiss-Manfréd Works in 1912. During World War I, the company made many types of Albatros and Fokker fighter planes.

Before 1919, the company built ocean liners, dreadnought type battleships and submarines, power plants, automobiles and many types of fighter aircraft.

The world&#x27;s first turboprop engine was the Jendrassik Cs-1 designed by the Hungarian mechanical engineer György Jendrassik. It was built and tested in the Ganz factory in Budapest between 1939 and 1942. It was planned to be fitted to the Varga RMI-1 X/H twin-engined reconnaissance bomber designed by László Varga in 1940, but the program was cancelled. Jendrassik had also designed a small-scale 75 kW turboprop in 1937.

==After World War II==
In 1947, the Ganz Works was nationalised and in 1949 it became independent and six big companies came into existence, including the Ganz Transformer Factory. In 1959, Ganz Wagon and Machine Factory merged with the MÁVAG Locomotive and Machine Factory under the name of Ganz-MÁVAG Locomotive, Wagon and Machine Works. Of the products of the Works, outstanding results were shown in the field of the manufacture of diesel railcars and multiple units. Traditional products included tramcars as well, and customers included the tramway network of Budapest. In the meantime the Foundry workshop was closed down.

In 1974, the locomotive and wagon Works were merged under the name of Railway Vehicle Factory and then the machine construction branch went through significant development. The production of industrial and apartment house lifts became a new branch. Ganz-MÁVAG took over a lot of smaller plants in the 1960s and 1970s and their product range was extended. Among other things, they increased their bridge-building capacity. They made iron structures for several Tisza bridges, for the Erzsébet Bridge in Budapest, for public road bridges in Yugoslavia and for several industrial halls.

The Ganz Shipyard experienced its most productive times during the four decades following nationalisation. In the course of this period 1100 ship units were produced, the number of completed seagoing ships was 240 and that of floating cranes was 663. As a result of the great economic and social crises of the 1980s, Ganz-MÁVAG had to be reorganised. The company was transformed into seven independent Works and three joint ventures.

==Ganz since 1989==
In 1989, the British company Telfos Holdings gained a majority of the shares in Ganz Railway Vehicle Factory Co. Ltd. and the name of the company was changed to Ganz-Hunslet Co. Ltd. In the course of 1991 and 1992, the Austrian company Jenbacher Werke obtained 100% of the company&#x27;s shares and consequently the railway vehicle factory is now a member of the international railway vehicle manufacturing group, Jenbacher Transport Systeme. At present, the Ganz Electric Works, under the name of Ganz-Ansaldo is a member of the Italian industrial giant, AnsaldoBreda. The Ganz Works were transformed into holdings. Ganz-Danubius was wound up in 1994. The Ganz Electric Meter Factory in Gödöllő became the member of the international Schlumberger group.

In 2006, the power transmission and distribution sectors of Ganz Transelektro were acquired by Crompton Greaves, but still doing business under the Ganz brand name, while the unit dealing with electric traction (propulsion and control systems for electric vehicles) was acquired by Škoda Transportation and is now a part of Škoda Electric.

Now the plant is operated by a new investor as a tenant, Ganz Transformer Motor and Manufacturing Ltd., after the previous owner was unable to finance the production.
