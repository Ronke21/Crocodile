<text>Grace Park (born March 6, 1979), born Park Ji-eun (), is a retired South Korean professional golfer on the LPGA Tour. She was a member of the LPGA Tour from 2000 until her retirement in 2012 and won six LPGA Tour events, including one major championship, during her career.

==Amateur career==
Park was born Park Ji-eun in Seoul, South Korea. She moved to Hawaii at the age of 12, and then to Arizona. She received the 1996 Dial Award as top female high-school scholar-athlete in the United States. She attended Arizona State University and graduated from Ewha Womans University in 2003. In 2002, she won the Honda Award (now the Honda Sports Award) as the best female collegiate golfer in the nation.

Park had an outstanding amateur career in the United States being Rolex Junior Player of the Year in 1994 and 1996, winning several amateur championships in 1998 including the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur and the Women&#x27;s Western Amateur. She tied for eighth as an amateur in the 1999 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open.

==Professional career==
Park turned professional in 1999 and decided to play on the Futures Tour instead of taking exemptions to LPGA Tour tournaments. She won five of the ten tournaments she entered and became one of the first three golfers to gain automatic LPGA Tour exempt status by finishing top of the money list. She was named Rookie of the Year and Player of the Year.

She won at least one LPGA tournament in each season from 2000 to 2004, including her only major, the 2004 Kraft Nabisco Championship. The years 2005 and 2006 were difficult for Park as she suffered from back and neck injuries, and success continued to elude her the following two seasons as well. In April 2009 it was reported that Park had undergone a successful hip surgery, and that she would be off the LPGA tour for several months.

In June 2012, Park announced her retirement from golf.

The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; has described Park as &quot;the striking beauty, the tall and proud walk, the dazzling smile&quot; and she has attracted sponsorship from Nike and Rolex.

<text>USS &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; (DD-177) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot;, named for Presley O&#x27;Bannon, was laid down by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, 12 November 1918, launched 28 February 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Henry O&#x27;Bannon Cooper descendant by marriage of Lt. O&#x27;Bannon, and commissioned at San Francisco 27 August 1919. &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; sailed out of San Diego for exercises and training maneuvers along the coast of California and in Hawaiian waters throughout her career. In the spring of 1920 she conducted experiments with torpedoes, and then was in reserve commission from June to November, when she resumed her training schedule. She decommissioned at San Diego 27 May 1922, was struck from the Navy List 19 May 1936, and was sold 29 September 1936.

<text>The Admiralty Mountains (alternatively Admiralty Range) is a large group of high mountains and individually named ranges and ridges in northeastern Victoria Land, Antarctica. 
This mountain group is bounded by the sea (Ross Sea and Southern Ocean), and by the Dennistoun Glacier, Ebbe Glacier, and Tucker Glacier.

==Discovery and naming==
The Admiralty Mountains were discovered in January 1841 by Captain James Clark Ross, Royal Navy, who named them for the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty under whose orders he served.

==Location==
The Admiralty Mountains lie to the east of the Concord Mountains and the Victory Mountains, separated from them by the Ebbe Glacier in the north and the Tucker Glacier further south, which flows into the Ross Sea. They are to the south of the Anare Mountains, separated from them by the Anare Pass and the Dennistoun Glacier, which flow east to the Southern Ocean. To their east they are bounded by the Southern Ocean, Robertson Bay, the Adare Peninsula and the Ross Sea.

The Dennistoun Glacier which flows past the northeastern section of the Admiralty Mountains, separates then from the Quam Heights and Hedgpeth Heights in the Anare Mountains to the north.
The Robinson Heights in the northwest Admiralty Mountains are separated from the Anare Mountains to the north by the Anare Pass.
They are east of the Everett Range in the Concord Mountains.
The Homerun Range in the Admiralty Mountains is east of the Mirabito Range in the Concord Mountains.
Further south, the Admiralty Mountains face the Cartographers Range in the Victory Mountains across the Tucker Glacier.

The southern tip of the mountains joins to the Hallett Peninsula to the north of Tucker Inlet on the Ross Sea.
Moubray Bay is to the north of the Hallett Peninsula, and receives several glaciers that drain the southeast of the range. 
The Adare Peninsula extends along the coast to the north of Moubray Bay and encloses Robertson Bay, which receives several glaciers that drain the central part of the mountains. 
To the north of this bay, glaciers drain the northeast of the mountains directly into the Southern Ocean.

== Mountains and peaks ==

This range includes the following mountains and peaks, among many others:
==Glaciers==
The main glaciers bounding the mountains are the Dennistoun Glacier to the northeast, which flows east to the Southern Ocean, Ebbe Glacier to the northwest, a tributary of the Lillie Glacier, which flows west and then north to Ob&#x27; Bay, and the large Tucker Glacier along the western edge, which flows southeast to the Ross Sea.

*Dennistoun Glacier (), a glacier, long, draining the northern slopes of Mount Black Prince, Mount Royalist and Mount Adam in the Admiralty Mountains. It flows northwest between the Lyttelton Range and Dunedin Range, turning east on rounding the latter range to enter the sea south of Cape Scott.
*Ebbe Glacier (), a tributary glacier about long, draining northwest from the Homerun Range and Robinson Heights, and then west-northwest between Everett Range and Anare Mountains into Lillie Glacier. This feature saddles with Tucker Glacier, the latter draining southeast to the Ross Sea.
*Tucker Glacier (), a major valley glacier of Victoria Land, Antarctica, about long, flowing southeast between the Admiralty Mountains and the Victory Mountains to the Ross Sea. There is a snow saddle at the glacier&#x27;s head, just west of Homerun Range, from which the Ebbe Glacier flows northwestward.

A number of smaller glaciers drain the east of the mountains to the sea, including (from north to south) Simpson Glacier, Pitkevitch Glacier, Shipley Glacier, Ommanney Glacier, Dugdale Glacier, Murray Glacier, Moubray Glacier, Burnette Glacier and Ironside Glacier.

==Mountain groups==

Formally named mountain groups include:
* Homerun Range (), a northwest-trending range, long and wide, east of Everett Range at the heads of the Ebbe Glacier and Tucker Glacier.
* Robinson Heights () are the mainly ice-covered heights , elliptical in plan and long, which rise south of Anare Pass and form the northwest end of the Admiralty Mountains.
* Findlay Range , a range lying parallel to and west of Lyttelton Range, extending between Grigg Peak and Sorensen Peak.
* Lyttelton Range (), a narrow northwest-trending mountain range located south of Dunedin Range. The range is long and forms the western wall of the upper part of the Dennistoun Glacier.
* Dunedin Range (), a northwest-trending mountain range, long and wide. It is located east of Lyttelton Range.
* McGregor Range (), a mountain range long in the south-central Admiralty Mountains. The range is circumscribed by the flow of the Tucker Glacier, Leander Glacier, Fitch Glacier and Man-o-War Glacier.

Mountains that are in the center of an unnamed mountain group include:
* Mount Minto (), a lofty, mostly ice-free mountain rising to , located east of Mount Adam in the central portion of the Admiralty Mountains.
* Mount Francis (), a massive, ridgelike mountain, high, that overlooks Tucker Glacier from the north, standing between Tyler Glacier and Staircase Glacier. 
* Mount Chider (), a notable mountain, high, standing southeast of Mount Hart. 
* Slagle Ridge (), a high and massive snow-covered ridge between Slone Glacier and Burnette Glacier.

<doc id="1121365" wikidata="Q784339" url="?curid=1121365" title="Vol (heraldry)">
<text>A vol (French for &quot;flight&quot;) is a heraldic symbol consisting of a pair of outstretched, usually plumed bird&#x27;s wings, which are connected together at their shoulders without having any bird&#x27;s body in the middle. This was formerly popular in crests, especially in Germanic heraldry, but has found popularity outside heraldry in more recent times with its use as insignia in aviation.

The French Armée de l&#x27;Air, one of the world&#x27;s first air forces, adopted a vol for its cap badge, rather than the eagle used by many other air forces. In France, the eagle is associated with the Napoleonic Empire.

==Cap badges==

Many European countries have an eagle as the main charge of the heraldic shields of their respective monarchies: Germany, Austria-Hungary, and pre-revolutionary Russia all used some derivative of this bird in their badge. Poland did too, and even kept its badge under Communist rule, because Poland did not have a king since the partition of Poland late in the eighteenth century, so the symbol was merely nominal. In America, the cap badge of the US Air Force is the Great Seal of the United States, which also includes an eagle. But its use for the US Air Force derives from that service&#x27;s derivation from the US Army, which also had the same badge.

Another source for putting an eagle on the cap badge is that it stands for royalty in general. Thus the Royal Air Force includes a complete eagle, even though the coat of arms of the United Kingdom does not. The air forces of various Arab countries do as well. And the air force of Egypt, although not a monarchy, uses &quot;Saladin&#x27;s Eagle&quot; as well; formerly, they used a hawk. During the Second World War, the air forces of Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, and Yugoslavia also used a bird of prey as their cap badge. Over a decade after the Second World War, Japan formed the Air Self-Defense Force. This too had a bird other than an eagle as an emblem: a bird-of-prey called a kite, referring to a battle during which a kite was seen in a tree against the rising sun.

Other countries use the vol as their main emblem. Israel Air Force is notable in that its emblem, not being a complete bird, avoids idolatry. The countries of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War generally rejected the use of the eagle in the list of state seals above. For example, the Soviet air force used a vol very similar to the French, but supported a conventional, five-pointed star, so as to distinguish themselves from having anything to do with Imperial Russia. Hungary had nearly the same symbol, while Romania had a different one. The Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte, or East German Air Force, used a particularly modernistic vol as its cap badge. This had extra significance, because the Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany used an eagle carrying a swastika. Currently, the Russians have returned to their heraldic past, while the Germans use a symbol different from that of the Luftwaffe.

==Insignia of branch of service==
Air services which are not independent from their country&#x27;s armies have used a vol as the insignia of their branch of service. The US Army Air Forces, during the Second World War, used a winged, two-bladed propeller on the lapels of their tunics. The same sort of insigne was used by the Soviets before they had an independent air force. Warsaw Pact armed forces often had a red, five-pointed star superimposed upon the juncture point of this symbol.

==Pilot&#x27;s insigne==
It is as the symbol of &quot;wings&quot; given to trained aircraft operators for which the vol is primarily used. All of the pilot&#x27;s badges of the USAF, as well as the various Naval Aviator&#x27;s badges of the USN, employ vols with a shield standing for Congress in the middle. These are of different design, and the USAF used silver while the USN uses gold, and has an anchor behind the shield. The US Army uses &quot;wings&quot; with an open parachute in the middle for paratroopers.

During the Second World War, the uniforms of Denmark, Norway, Belgium, France, Nationalist China, and even the RAF used a form of the vol as their pilot&#x27;s insigne. The air forces of Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Poland, and Yugoslavia used an entire bird. The Japanese had quite a different emblem; its wings are recognisably those of an aircraft.

==Rank insigne==
For the Luftwaffe, a vol was used to replace the chevron on the sleeves of enlisted men&#x27;s uniforms. And the Romanian Air Force before 1945 used a vol for the shoulder rank insignia for warrant officers. UBS investment bank currently operates shoulder rank insignia amongst its Volatility Trading Department.

==Collar tab insigne==
The uniforms of British Army officers have &quot;gorget patches&quot; of a color different from the rest of the uniform sewn on their lapels, and so did many arms of the German military. Specifically, the uniforms of both enlisted ranks and officers in the Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte (or East German Air Force) did too. These had embroidered symbols on them which were rather similar to the vols used for rank insignia.

==Heraldic Use==
&#x27;Vol&#x27; is term used in both Anglophone and Francophone heraldries - as in the bearings of Ripstein, Canada. Both the terms &#x27;vol&#x27; and &#x27;demi vol&#x27; (half a vol, i.e. a single wing) have been turning up every so often in Scots heraldry since the late 17th century - Sir Thomas Brand&#x27;s crest, &#x27;a volle with the baton of his office [Knight Usher of the Green Rod] in pale&#x27;, in the Scottish Public Register volume 1, page 123, and the crest of Richard Graham, Viscount of Prestoun, volume 1, page 84</text><links>

<doc id="1121372" wikidata="Q1139758" url="?curid=1121372" title="Jamaica Premier League">
<text>The Jamaica Premier League (formerly the National Premier League), commonly abbreviated as JPL and officially known as the [[J. Wray and Nephew Ltd.|Wray and Nephew]] Jamaica Premier League for sponsorship reasons, is sanctioned by the Jamaican Football Federation as the top division for men&#x27;s association football in Jamaica. Contested between 14 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the JFF Championship. Most games are played on Sunday afternoons and Monday evenings &quot;(Monday Night Football)&quot;.

==History==
The Jamaica Premier League was formed in 1973 to serve as the top tier of Jamaican professional club football. The league&#x27;s inaugural season kicked off on September 22, 1973 as the &quot;Craven A National Club League Championships&quot;, and finished with Santos F.C. as the first title winners. 14 clubs have been crowned champions of Jamaica. Portmore United F.C. is the most successful team with 7 top flight titles.

The 2019–20 season was ruled null and void on March 12, 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. Later in 2020, Professional Football Jamaica Limited (PFJL) began managing the league with its focus being the commercialization and marketing of professional football in the country.

In May 2021, the Jamaican Football Federation announced that the league would resume, playing a shortened season between June and September, competed by the 12 teams from the previous season. In June 2021, UWI F.C. announced it would withdraw ahead of the 2021 season due to the modified schedule conflicting with other player commitments; leaving 11 teams in the competition.

Montego Bay United was promoted to the league at the start of the 2022 season, restoring the league to 12 teams. Also in 2022, the league entered an agreement with Admiral Sportswear to supply kits to all teams in the league.

The league was expanded to 14 teams for the 2022–23 season.

==Competition format==
The Jamaica Premier League&#x27;s regular season typically runs from late August to May the following year. The competition is divided into two stages; the single table regular season and the playoffs.

The regular season is contested in a round robin format with each team playing every other team at home and away for a total of 26 matches. The top six clubs contend for the championship in the playoffs, the first and second place regular season finishers advance directly to the semifinals and the third to sixth place teams advance to the quarterfinals.

The quarterfinals and semifinals are played in a two legged, home and away, format with the winner decided on aggregate with away goal rules enforced. The finals and third place matches are contested as a single leg match.

The bottom two regular season finishers are relegated and replaced the next season by the top two finishers of the JFF National Tier II.

Hazard United won 2 league titles while based in Clarendon before the club relocated to St. Catherine and rebranded as Portmore United.

No club from the parishes of Hanover, Manchester, Portland, St. Elizabeth, St. Mary, St. Thomas nor Trelawny have won the league.

== Regional competitions ==
The top two finishers in a given season qualify for the CONCACAF Caribbean Cup, a regional club tournament held each fall. The third place team qualify for the CFU Club Shield. A top-three finish in the CONCACAF Caribbean Cup is the only route for Jamaican teams to enter the CONCACAF Champions Cup.

The league has produced two Caribbean Club Champions, each with two titles; Portmore United F.C. (2005, 2019) and Harbour View F.C. (2004, 2007). The Caribbean Club Championship was replaced with the CONCACAF Caribbean Cup in 2023 as a part of CONCACAF&#x27;s new club football ecosystem.

No team from the league has made it past the first round of the CONCACAF Champions Cup. The league has been more successful in the discontinued CONCACAF League competition with both Portmore United F.C. (2018) and Waterhouse F.C. (2019) making it to the quarterfinals.

==Sponsorship==
During the 1970s to 1990s, the league received sponsorship from Craven A, a subsidiary of Carreras Tobacco Company, throughout its initial two decades. However, in 2002, the pressure from various lobbyists, notably the American Cancer Society, led to the termination of the cigarette company’s sponsorship of both the premier league and local horse racing, marking the end of direct associations between tobacco companies and sporting events.

Wray and Nephew assumed sponsorship of the league in 2002 and subsequently extended the contract until 2012. However, their arrangement abruptly concluded in 2007 when Wray and Nephew released the Jamaica Football Federation from the contract without penalties. Subsequently, the league entered into an agreement with investment company Cash Plus in 2007, despite uncertainties arising in early 2008 about Cash Plus’s commitment. In April 2008, the Premier League Clubs Association (PLCA) ceased their association with Cash Plus Limited as league sponsors and initiated plans for legal action against the investment firm.

Digicel signed a three-year sponsorship deal with the league that remained active until 2011.

Red Stripe assumed the title sponsorship of the league starting from the 2011-12 season, a contract that concluded after the league was abandoned in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Digicel commenced a second three-year sponsorship spell from 2020 to 2023. Additionally, after a 16-year hiatus, Wray and Nephew returned as title sponsors in 2023.

<text>The Queen Elizabeth Range () is a rugged mountain range that parallels the eastern side of Marsh Glacier for nearly from Nimrod Glacier in the north to Law Glacier in the south. 
Mount Markham, high, is the highest elevation in the range.

==Name==
The Queen Elizabeth Range was named by J.H. Miller of the New Zealand party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE; 1956–58) who, with G.W. Marsh, explored this area. 
It was named for Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain, the patron of the expedition.

==Location==

The Queen Elizabeth Range is bounded to the north by the Nimrod Glacier, which separates it from the Churchill Mountains and Nash Range.
To the east the Lowery Glacier and Robb Glacier separate it from the Holland Range.
The Law Glacier to the south separates its from the Colbert Hills and Queen Alexandra Range.
The Marsh Glacier separates it from the Miller Range to the west.

==Major glaciers==

<text>Ectocarpene is the rearrangement product of pre-ectocarpene, the sexual attractant, or pheromone, found with several species of brown algae (Phaeophyceae). Ectocarpene has a fruity scent and can be sensed by humans when millions of algae gametes swarm the seawater and the females start emitting the substance&#x27;s precursor to attract the male gametes.

All the double bonds are &quot;cis&quot; and the absolute configuration of the stereocenter is (&quot;S&quot;).

==History==

Ectocarpene was isolated from algae &quot;Ectocarpus&quot; (order &quot;Ectocarpales&quot;) by Müller and col. in 1971. It has been mistakened to be the active substance for gamete attraction until 1995, and pre-ectocarpene was discovered to be active. This confusion arises from the sigmatropic rearrangement (and thus deactivation) of pre-ectocarpene in minutes at room temperature:

This is as to only have the phermon active in the proximity of the female gametes.

The presence of ectocarpene in &quot;Capsicum&quot; fruit was reported in 2010. Studies concluded that its &quot;sweet and green&quot; aroma surfaced through identification tests as well as sensory tests. Its relatively low but influential presence helps develop the &quot;Capsicum&quot; fruit’s profile.

==Related Compounds==

(&quot;E&quot;)-Ectocarpene is a product associated to a group referred to as Bryophytes, a family of liverworts, algae, and other species with medicinal and nutritional properties. It is suggested that (&quot;E&quot;)-ectocarpene may have an evolutionary relationship between families of liverworts and algae as its concentration of formation varies based on the species’ environmental conditions.

<text>The Marsh Glacier () is a glacier about 110 km (70 mi) long that is a tributary of the Nimrod Glacier, which enters the west of the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica.

==Location==

The Marsh Glacier flows north from the Antarctic polar plateau between the Miller Range to the west and Queen Elizabeth Range to the east into the Nimrod Glacier. 
It was seen by a New Zealand party of the CTAE (1956–58) and named for G.W. Marsh, a member of the party.

==Left tributaries==

Tributary glaciers entering from the left (Miller Range) are:
===Argo Glacier===
A glacier in the Miller Range, long, flowing northeast to enter Marsh Glacier just south of Macdonald Bluffs. 
Named by NZGSAE (1961–62) after the vessel sailed by Jason in Greek mythology.

===Argosy Glacier===
Glacier about long, flowing east through the Miller Range to enter Marsh Glacier north of Kreiling Mesa. 
Named by the NZGSAE (1961–62).

===Ascent Glacier===
Glacier, wide, flowing north to enter Argosy Glacier in the Miller Range just east of Milan Ridge. Named by the NZGSAE (1961-62) who used this glacier to gain access to the central Miller Range.

===Astro Glacier===
Glacier between Turner Hills and Tricom Peak in the Miller Range, flowing northeast into the Marsh Glacier. Seen by the northern party of the NZGSAE (1961-62) and so named because an astro station was set up on the bluff at the mouth of the glacier in December 1961.

===Skua Glacier===
A small southern tributary of Astro Glacier in the Miller Range.
Mapped by the northern party of the NZGSAE (1961-62) and so named because of the skuas seen at its lower part in December 1961.

==Right tributaries==
Tributary glaciers entering from the right (Queen Elizabeth Range) are:

===Princess Anne Glacier===
Glacier in the Queen Elizabeth Range, flowing from the area south of Mount Bonaparte between Cotton and Bartrum Plateaus into Marsh Glacier. 
Named by the northern party of the NZGSAE (1961-62) for Princess Anne, daughter of Queen Elizabeth II.

===Rabot Glacier===
A glacier in the Queen Elizabeth Range, flowing west from Mount Rabot between Mount Counts and Bartrum Plateau to enter Marsh Glacier. 
Named in association with Mount Rabot by the NZGSAE, 1961–62.

<doc id="1121383" wikidata="Q4669836" url="?curid=1121383" title="USS Hogan">
<text>USS &quot;Hogan&quot; (DD-178/DMS-6) was a in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Namesake==
Daniel Hogan entered the Navy on board the schooner at Boston, Massachusetts, in 1811 and transferred to frigate on 18 February 1812. During the War of 1812 he won distinction on board &quot;Constitution&quot; in an engagement with the British frigate . When &quot;Constitution&#x27;s&quot; flag was shot away from the main topgallant masthead, Hogan climbed the rigging and lashed the colors to the masthead. This action was to prevent the enemy from thinking &quot;Constitution&quot; had struck her colors.

In later action between &quot;Constitution&quot; and on 3 January 1813 he was severely wounded, losing the fingers of both hands. He died on 1 September 1818.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Hogan&quot; was launched by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, 12 April 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Magnus A. Anderson, a sister of the Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane and commissioned 1 October 1919.

==Service history==
After shakedown, &quot;Hogan&quot; arrived at San Diego on 21 November to join the Pacific Destroyer Force. From 23 November to 6 February 1920 she sailed in company with her division and engaged in fleet maneuvers, patrol duty, torpedo exercises and target practice along the California coast. On 25 March she departed for Hawaii, where she operated for the next month. The destroyer rejoined her squadron at San Diego in late April for five months of gunnery exercises and trial runs in that area. She returned to San Diego in early 1921 and engaged in important experimental torpedo practice and divisional operations until 9 December. During that time, in October, &quot;Hogan&quot; became the first US Navy ship to be refuelled while underway, towed astern by the oiler . For the remainder of her service &quot;Hogan&quot; assisted U.S. battleships in conducting torpedo firing exercises in the Pacific. She decommissioned at San Diego on 27 May 1922.

=== Conversion to minesweeper ===
Recommissioned 7 August 1940, &quot;Hogan&quot; underwent conversion to a high speed minesweeper at Mare Island and reclassified DMS-6. Her activity up to World War II consisted mainly of intensified minesweeper training and patrol duty in the Caribbean and along the Eastern Coast,

===World War II===
During the early months of the war, &quot;Hogan&quot; acted as a convoy escort in the Caribbean and eastern Atlantic, protecting shipping from U-boat attack. The first major operation in which she took part was the invasion of North Africa in late 1942. For this important amphibious assault, mounted over an entire ocean, &quot;Hogan&quot; departed Norfolk 24 October and arrived with the Center Force off Fedhala for preliminary sweeps 7 November. As the landings began early next day, the minesweeper continued to patrol the vital transport area. Just after 05:00, she was sent to investigate strange running lights and came upon a French steamer and escort vessel. &quot;Hogan&quot; ordered both ships to reverse course, and when the order was not obeyed fired a burst of machine gun fire across the escort&#x27;s bow. The ship, &quot;Victoria&quot;, replied with fire of her own and attempted to ram the minesweeper, but &quot;Hogan&quot; avoided her and with 20 mm fire forced her surrender.

In the days that followed, the minesweeper continued to conduct antisubmarine patrol off Fedhala, searching for submarines that attacked the transports on 11 November. The ship entered Casablanca harbor on 18 November, the invasion a success, and after patrol duties sailed for Norfolk, arriving on 26 December.

&quot;Hogan&quot; next returned to coastal convoy duties until November 1943. She sailed on 13 November from Norfolk to join the Pacific Fleet, transited the Panama Canal, arriving at Mare Island on 5 December. The minesweeper was needed for the first phase of the long island campaign toward Japan, the invasion of the Marshalls, and sailed for Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein on 16 January 1944. &quot;Hogan&quot; carried out anti-submarine patrol off Roi Island before departing on 4 February for Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on 27 February.

After another period of convoy duty, &quot;Hogan&quot; arrived at Milne Bay on 7 April to prepare for the Hollandia operation. The attack group sailed on 18 April and arrived at Humboldt Bay four days later. &quot;Hogan&quot; and other minesweepers cleared enemy mines for Admiral Daniel Barbey&#x27;s invasion force, after which the ship carried out shore bombardment and screening duties. She arrived at Cape Sudest with on 25 April.

&quot;Hogan&quot; sailed from Eniwetok on 10 June to make preliminary sweeps of Saipan for the invasion to come. She remained off Saipan during the assault on 15 June, coming under enemy shore fire, and moved to Guam the next day. As the Japanese fleet moved toward the Marianas for a decisive naval battle, &quot;Hogan&quot; returned to Saipan to protect the transports. In the great carrier battle which followed 19–20 June, the American fleet won a stunning victory, crippling the Japanese naval air arm and securing the Marianas operation from interference. &quot;Hogan&quot; returned to the staging base at Eniwetok on 30 June, but returned to Guam on 12 July to carry out screening and minesweeping duties for the assault there. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 5 August 1944.

Following a tour of escort duty in the Solomons, &quot;Hogan&quot; steamed via Pearl Harbor to San Francisco for repairs, arriving on 5 October. As the recapture of the Philippines gained momentum, the ship steamed from San Francisco on 6 November and arrived at the Manus staging area on 4 December 1944. Moving to Leyte Gulf before Christmas, &quot;Hogan&quot; sortied with the Minesweeping and Hydrographic Group on 2 January 1945. Kamikaze attacks began soon afterward, and continued during the voyage to Lingayen Gulf. The minesweepers entered the invasion area on 2 January and began their sweeping operations. Four of the minesweepers were sunk or damaged, and &quot;Hogan&quot;″s gunners were busy with attacking aircraft. With the operation well underway, the ship arrived at Leyte Gulf on 16 January.

After retiring to Tinian, &quot;Hogan&quot; sailed once more on 7 February to take part in the important assault on Iwo Jima. During this operation she swept mines, screened transports, and carried out shore bombardment before departing with a group of battleships and their escorts 7 March. Arriving Pearl Harbor on 13 April via Ulithi she continued to San Diego on 3 May 1945.

&quot;Hogan&quot; underwent major repairs and reclassified AG-105 on 5 June 1945. The veteran ship was assigned as a target ship for bombing tests and was sunk off San Diego on 8 November 1945.
==Awards==
&quot;Hogan&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service, for sinking four submarines and bringing down two planes.

As of 2009, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

<text>Threshing or thrashing is the process of loosening the edible part of grain (or other crop) from the straw to which it is attached. It is the step in grain preparation after reaping. Threshing does not remove the bran from the grain.

==History of threshing==

Through much of the important history of agriculture, threshing was time-consuming and usually laborious, with a bushel of wheat taking about an hour. In the late 18th century, before threshing was mechanized, about one-quarter of agricultural labor was devoted to it.

It is likely that in the earliest days of agriculture the little grain that was raised was shelled by hand, but as the quantity increased the grain was probably beaten out with a stick, or the sheaf beaten upon the ground. An improvement on this, as the quantity further increased, was the practice of the ancient Egyptians of spreading out the loosened sheaves on a circular enclosure of hard ground, and driving oxen, sheep or other animals round and round over it so as to tread out the grain. This enclosure was placed on an elevated piece of ground so that when the straw was removed the wind blew away the chaff and left the corn. A contemporary version of this in some locations is to spread the grain on the surface of a country road so the grain may be threshed by the wheels of passing vehicles.

This method, however, damaged part of the grain, and it was partially superseded by the threshing sledge, a heavy frame mounted with three or more rollers, sometimes spiked, which revolved as it was drawn over the spread out corn by two oxen. A common sledge with a ridged or grooved bottom was also used. Similar methods to these were used by the ancient Greeks, and continued to be employed in the modern period in some places. In Italy the use of a tapering roller fastened to an upright shaft in the centre of the thrashing floor and pulled round from the outer end by oxen seems to be a descendant of the Roman or roller sledge.
The flail, a pair of connected sticks used to beat the grain, evolved from the early method of using a single stick. It, with the earlier methods, was described by Pliny the Elder in his first-century CE &quot;Natural History&quot;: &quot;The cereals are threshed in some places with the threshing board on the threshing floor; in others they are trampled by a train of horses, and in others they are beaten with flails&quot;. It seems to have been the thrashing implement in general use in all Northern European countries, and was the chief means of thrashing grain as late as 1860. It was known in Japan very early, and was probably used in conjunction with the stripper, an implement fashioned very much like a large comb, with the teeth made of hard wood and pointing upwards. The straw after being reaped was brought to this and combed through by hand, the heads being drawn off and afterwards threshed on the threshing floor by the flail. Much more recently, just such an implement, known as a &quot;heckle&quot;, has been used for combing the bolls or heads off flax, or for straightening the fibre in the after-treatment.

After the grain had been beaten out by the flail or ground out by other means the straw was carefully raked away and the corn and chaff collected to be separated by winnowing when there was a wind blowing. This consisted of tossing the mixture of corn and chaff into the air so that the wind carried away the chaff while the grain fell back on the threshing floor. The best grain fell nearest while the lightest grain was carried some distance before falling, thus an approximate grading of the grain was obtained. It was also performed when there was no wind by fanning while pouring the mixture from a vessel. Later, a fanning or winnowing mill was invented. Barns were constructed with large doors opening in the direction of the prevailing winds so that the wind could blow right through the barn and across the threshing floor for the purpose of winnowing the corn. The flail continued to be used for special purposes such as flower seeds, and also where the quantity grown was small enough to render it not worth while to use a threshing mill.

With regard to the amount of grain threshed in a day by the flail, a fair average quantity was 8 bushels of wheat, 30 bushels of oats, 16 bushels of barley, 20 bushels of beans, 8 bushels of rye and 20 bushels of buckwheat.

==Mechanization==
In the 18th century there were efforts to create a power-driven threshing machine. In 1732 Michael Menzies, a Scot, obtained a patent for a power-driven machine. This was arranged to drive a large number of flails operated by water power, but was not particularly successful. The first practical effort leading in the right direction was made by a Scottish farmer named Leckie about 1758. He invented what was described as a &quot;rotary machine consisting of a set of cross arms attached to a horizontal shaft and enclosed in a cylindrical case.&quot; This machine did not work very well, but it demonstrated the superiority of the rotary motion and pointed to the ways in which thrashing machines should be constructed.

True industrialization of threshing began in 1786 with the invention of the threshing machine by Scot Andrew Meikle. In this the loosened sheaves were fed, ears first, from a feeding board between two fluted revolving rollers to the beating cylinder. This cylinder or &quot;drum&quot; was armed with four iron-shod beaters or spars of wood parallel to its axle, and these striking the ears of corn as they protruded from the rollers knocked out the grain. The drum revolved at 200 to 250 revolutions per minute and carried the loose grain and straw on to a concave sieve beneath another revolving drum or rake with pegs which rubbed the straw on to the concave and caused the grain and chaff to fall through. Another revolving rake tossed the straw out of the machine. The straw thus passing under one peg drum and over the next was subjected to a thorough rubbing and tossing which separated the grain and chaff from it. These fell on to the floor beneath, ready for winnowing.

A later development of the beater-drum was to fix iron pegs on the framework, and thus was evolved the Scottish &quot;peg-mill,&quot; which remained the standard type for nearly a hundred years, and was adopted across the US. In Britain, the development of high-speed drums carried considerable risk, and a type of safety guard was mandated by the Threshing Machine Act of 1878.

==Contemporary industrialization==
In modern developed areas, threshing is mostly done by machine, usually by a combine harvester, which harvests, threshes, and winnows the grain while it is still in the field.

The cereal may be stored in a barn or silos.

==Threshing festivals==
A threshing bee was traditionally a bee in which local people gathered together to and get the season&#x27;s threshing done. Such bees were sometimes festivals or events within larger harvest festivals. The original purpose has largely become obsolete, but the festival tradition lives on in some modern examples that commemorate the past and include flea markets, hog wrestling, and dances.

<text>The Nimrod Glacier () is a major glacier about long, flowing from the polar plateau in a northerly direction through the Transantarctic Mountains into the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica.
==Location==

The Nimrod Glacier flows north between the Geologists and Miller Ranges, then northeasterly between the Churchill Mountains and Queen Elizabeth Range, and finally spills into Shackleton Inlet and the Ross Ice Shelf between Capes Wilson and Lyttelton.
It was photographed from the air by USN Operation Highjump, 1946–47. The name, given by US-ACAN, is in association with Shackleton Inlet and is for the &quot;Nimrod&quot;, the ship of the British Antarctic Expedition (1907–09) under Ernest Shackleton.
The mouth of the glacier is southeast of the Starshot Glacier and the Nursery Glacier.
It is north of Robb Glacier.
==Icefalls==

===Worsley Icefalls===

Icefalls near the head of Nimrod Glacier. 
Seen by the northern party of the NZGSAE (1961-62) and presumbably named for Frank Worsley, member of the British Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914-16, and Shackleton-Rowett Antarctic Expedition, 1921-22.

===Cooper Icefalls===
The main icefalls of the Nimrod Glacier, in the vicinity of Kon-Tiki Nunatak.

Named by the Holyoake, Cobham, and Queen Elizabeth Ranges party of the NZGSAE (1964-65) for M. Gray, postmaster and assistant radio officer at Scott Base, 1965.

===The Slot===
A small swift glacier descending from the polar plateau between Mount Ronca and Mount Summerson in the Geologists Range.
Seen by the northern party of the NZGSAE (1961-62) and so named because of its narrowness and crevassed nature.

===Lucy Glacier===
A wide glacier which flows southeast from the polar plateau, between Laird Plateau and McKay Cliffs, into Nimrod Glacier. 
Named for W.R. Lucy, surveyor with 1963-64 Scott Base projects, who wintered over in 1964, and was surveyor with the 1964-65 Geologists Range field party of the NZGSAE.

On December 31, 1993, a ski-equipped Hercules (LC-130) aircraft crashed on Lucy Glacier, near Mount Isbell. The aircraft was retrieving a group from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee who had spent six weeks investigating the geology in the mountains between the Byrd Glacier and Nimrod Glacier. The group consisted of Gina Seegers-Szablewski, Greg Gelhar, mountaineer Shaun Norman (New Zealand), and John Isbell.

<text>USS &quot;Howard&quot; (DD–179), (DMS-7) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Charles W. Howard, who was killed in the American Civil War aboard .

&quot;Howard&quot; was launched by Union Iron Works San Francisco, California on 26 April 1919, sponsored by Marion Filmer. The destroyer was commissioned on 29 January 1920 at Mare Island.

==Namesake==
Charles W. Howard volunteered for service in the U.S. Navy during the American Civil War, being appointed mate in October 1862. As acting ensign, he served on board and was in charge of the deck when that ship was attacked by Confederate torpedo boat in Charleston Harbor, on the night of 5 October 1863. Mounting the rail, he ordered the sentries to fire on the approaching enemy, and while exposed he received a mortal wound. He died five days later and was honored by being appointed acting master after his death &quot;for gallant conduct in face of the enemy.&quot;

==Service history==
&quot;Howard&quot; departed San Francisco on 1 March 1920 to join the Pacific Destroyer force at San Diego, California. After initial tactical maneuvers and gunnery training, she departed San Diego on 3 May for Topolobampo, Mexico. She rejoined her destroyer flotilla on 17 May to participate in intensive and prolonged operations in the San Diego area, including torpedo practice, patrol, battle practices, and exercises with submarines. Robert W. Hayler was commanding officer of &quot;Howard&quot; from 5 July 1921 until the ship decommissioned on 27 May 1922.

===Classified DMS-7===
Recommissioned 29 August 1940, &quot;Howard&quot; was converted to a minesweeper and reclassified DMS-7. She sailed from San Diego in mid-October, arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 29 October, and proceeded on 19 November for duty in the Caribbean Sea. She remained there until 17 May 1941 conducting minesweeping assignments and patrol duty enforcing the Neutrality Act. &quot;Howard&quot; returned to Norfolk on 19 May and participated in exercises along the Chesapeake Bay until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 plunged the United States into World War II.

===World War II===
&quot;Howard&quot; was underway on 8 December on escort duty, and in the months that followed, convoyed transports and tankers in the Caribbean and western Atlantic, keeping supply lanes open despite German U-boats. Plans called for an invasion of North Africa in 1942, a massive and hazardous amphibious operation projected across thousands of miles of ocean. In October, &quot;Howard&quot; joined Admiral Hewitt&#x27;s Western Naval Task Force at Norfolk. She sailed on 24 October and screened the cruiser during the Atlantic crossing. As troops landed on 8 November she performed both minesweeping and screening duties. During the first phase of the Naval Battle of Casablanca that day, &quot;Howard&quot; screened &quot;Augusta&quot; as the cruiser engaged shore batteries and dueled with the . The destroyer then remained off Casablanca and Safi while the American soldiers consolidated their beachheads and moored with naval units at Casablanca on 16 November 1942. After performing anti-submarine patrol duties she returned to Norfolk on 29 December.

During most of 1943, &quot;Howard&quot; plied the convoy lanes of the Atlantic and Caribbean protecting Allied ships from submarine and air attack. She steamed to the West Indies, Panama, Newfoundland, and Iceland on this duty, a key part of which was protecting the oil tankers vital to the conduct of the war.

As the tempo of operations against Japan increased, &quot;Howard&quot; was transferred to the western Pacific theater, sailing from Norfolk on 21 November 1943, and arriving at San Diego on 7 December. After repairs and training, the ship sailed on 25 March, escorting ships to Pearl Harbor and Majuro. She screened a returning convoy to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 24 April, and there began preparations for the gigantic invasion of the Marianas. Joining Admiral Richmond Turner&#x27;s amphibious task force, &quot;Howard&quot; sortied on 29 May and arrived off Saipan via Eniwetok on 13 June. The ship swept minefields during the day and conducted patrol and harassing fire by night until the landings on 15 June. &quot;Howard&quot; then was assigned to screen transports, and made two shuttle voyages to Eniwetok and back to the Marianas before returning to Pearl Harbor on 10 August 1944.

&quot;Howard&quot;″s next operation was the invasion of the Philippines, slated for October on the island of Leyte. Following training in the Hawaiian Islands she arrived at Eniwetok on 24 September, and steamed to Leyte Gulf on 17 October. Once more she carried out minesweeping duties, clearing paths in Surigao Strait and Leyte Gulf, despite heavy weather. Her task completed, she departed on 24 October for Manus with the invasion underway and during the first phase of the battle for Leyte Gulf, which ended in a victory for the U.S. Navy.

Training operations in the Admiralties occupied the ship for the next two months, but she sailed again from Manus on 23 December to take part in the next phase of the Philippines operation, the invasion of Luzon. She rendezvoused at Leyte Gulf on 30 December, and departed in convoy for Lingayen Gulf on 2 January 1945. During this voyage through the Philippines, the Japanese made &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, with &quot;Howard&quot; shooting one attacker down and assisting in destroying many others. The invasion force arrived on 6 January. The minesweepers began their work under almost constant air attack; and, by the time troops landed on 9 January three of &quot;Howard&quot;″s sister ships had been lost. The invasion was successful and the veteran minesweepers departed to arrive in Leyte Gulf on 15 January 1945 and Ulithi on 5 February.

As the American advance moved ever closer to Japan, &quot;Howard&quot; sailed from Tinian on 13 February with the invasion force for Iwo Jima. Assuming her customary role in advance of the landings, she commenced exploratory sweeps off the island on 16 February, fighting off numerous air attacks. After the assault 19 February the ship acted as a screening ship, arriving at Saipan on 2 March. Following another period of screening duty off Iwo Jima later in March, &quot;Howard&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor via Guam on 4 April 1945.

Newer ships now took the 25-year-old ship&#x27;s duty on the front lines. Reclassified AG-106 on 5 June 1945, she escorted submarines in Hawaiian waters and acted as plane guard for carrier operations before sailing for the United States on 2 October. Transiting the Panama Canal, &quot;Howard&quot; arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 2 November and decommissioned there on 30 November 1945. In 1946, &quot;Howard&quot; was sold to Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and scrapped.

==Awards==
&quot;Howard&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Wavin B.V. is a global manufacturer of plastic pipes, mainly for drainage and water supply purposes. The company was officially founded in the Netherlands on 5 August 1955, its name deriving from water and vinyl chloride. The company provides plastic pipe systems and products for tap water, surface heating and cooling, soil and waste, rain water, distribution of drinking water and gas and telecom applications.

The company is headquartered in Schiphol, Netherlands and operates in 25 European countries. 

Due to the common use of Wavin products, the name has become genericised in some parts of Ireland to refer to any manufacturer of orange-coloured drainpipes. The company operates in three locations in Ireland, with the main manufacturing and distribution plant in Balbriggan, North County Dublin, and additional offices in Lisburn and Cork 

Wavin&#x27;s own Technology and Innovation Centre (Wavin T&amp;I), employs more than 50 people to develop new products and systems with local Wavin companies. Products for the European market include the smartFIX push-fit fitting, the Sentio heating and cooling controls, Tegra manholes and inspection chambers and the SiTech+ low noise in-house soil and waste drainage system.
In 2012, Wavin was acquired by Orbia (previously Mexichem), a Mexican international company, expanding Mexichem&#x27;s operations in 22 European countries.

<doc id="1121425" wikidata="Q5544134" url="?curid=1121425" title="George Ryga">
<text>George Ryga (27 July 1932 – 18 November 1987) was a Canadian playwright, actor and novelist. His writings explored the experiences of Indigenous peoples in Canada, among other themes. His most famous work is &quot;The Ecstasy of Rita Joe&quot;.

==Early years==
Ryga was born in Deep Creek near Athabasca, Alberta to poor Ukrainian immigrant parents. Unable to continue his schooling past grade six, he worked at a variety of jobs, including radio copywriter. Ryga continued to study, taking correspondence courses, and winning a scholarship to the Banff School of Fine Arts. In 1955, he traveled to Europe, where he attended the World Assembly for Peace in Helsinki and worked for the BBC. The following year he returned to Canada.

==Career==
While living in Edmonton, he published his first book, &quot;Song of My Hands&quot; (1956), a collection of poems.

Ryga&#x27;s first play, &quot;Indian&quot;, was performed on television in 1961. He achieved national exposure with &quot;The Ecstasy of Rita Joe&quot; in 1967. The work, considered by many to be the most important English-language play by a Canadian playwright, is the story of a young native woman arriving in the city who finds that she has no place with either her own people or the white man. It was performed in Vancouver, at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa and in Washington state. In 1971, the work was performed as a ballet by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet.

Other plays by Ryga include:
* &quot;Captives of the Faceless Drummer&quot; – 1971
* &quot;Sunrise on Sarah – 1972
* &quot;Portrait of Angelica&quot; – 1973
* &quot;Ploughmen of the Glacier&quot; – 1977
* &quot;In the Shadow of the Vulture&quot; – 1985
* &quot;Paracelsus&quot; – 1986
* &quot;Summerland&quot; – 1992

He made a significant contribution to popular music when he wrote lyrics for a series of songs composed by the members of the Vancouver-based band The Collectors for the soundtrack of his 1969 play &quot;Grass and Wild Strawberries&quot;. &quot;Early Morning&quot;, the single release from the resulting &quot;Grass &amp; Wild Strawberries&quot; album, became a minor local hit, and the showstopping album track &quot;Seventeenth Summer&quot; was re-recorded by the band after it underwent a membership change and changed its name to Chilliwack. The distinctive track, strongly influenced by First Nations musical forms, became a signature tune in live shows by Chilliwack for many years afterward.

==Death==
He died in Summerland, British Columbia in 1987. His home was turned into the George Ryga Centre, an arts and culture centre, which existed until 2012 when it closed due to financial challenges. It is now in private hands.
==Recognition==
A biography, &quot;The Ecstasy of Resistance&quot;, by James Hoffman, was published in 1995.

Since 2004, the George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature has been presented to a British Columbian writer who has published a book with significant social themes. The 2021 recipient was Geoff Mynett.

A wall plaque to commemorate George Ryga was installed in the newly-opened Summerland Library in October of 2015. In 2016 the Ryga Arts Festival, inspired by George Ryga, was started in Summerland and so far has continued through 2021. In 2020, a George Ryga archive was established at the Summerland Museum.

<doc id="1121428" wikidata="Q735411" url="?curid=1121428" title="Siddharta (band)">
<text>Siddharta is a Slovenian alternative rock band formed in 1995. The band&#x27;s name is derived from the 1922 novel by the German writer Hermann Hesse, &quot;Siddhartha&quot;.

== History ==

=== Formation and Early Years ===
Siddharta was established in 1995 by Tomi Meglič (vocals, guitar), Primož Benko (guitar, backing vocals), Primož Majerič (bass), and Boštjan Meglič (drums). Their first public performance was held on March 17, 1995, at Šentvid High School in Ljubljana.

In 1997, the band participated in the Tivolski Pomp project, which included contributions from various emerging bands. Siddharta&#x27;s track &quot;Lunanai&quot; was featured on the compilation and led to their debut television appearance.

=== &quot;Id&quot; (1999): First album ===
Siddharta’s debut album, &quot;Id&quot;, was recorded at Studio Tivoli with Dejan Radičevič and Anders Kallmark from April 1998 to February 1999. The band produced two versions of the album: one for the domestic market and another for the international market. The album cover, created by designer students Maja Bagić and Ivijan Mujezinović, received the Zagreb Art and Design Triennial award. &quot;Id&quot; went platinum shortly after its release, selling 13,000 copies.

===&quot;Nord&quot; (2001): Second album===
After their headline performance at Slovenia&#x27;s largest rock festival, the Rock Otočec festival, Siddharta retreated from the public eye. Six months later, they released their second album &quot;Nord&quot; in May 2001. An English version was also recorded, for which Peter Penko and Žarko Pak worked as producers. For the recording of the album, Siddharta invited a bass player, Jani Hace, who later joined the band as an official member.

7,000 copies of &quot;Nord&quot; were sold in less than two months after the release.

==== Tour, lineup changes, remix album (2001-2003) ====
Siddharta won another Zlati Petelin award in 2001, the Music Group of the Year award.

In the spring of 2001, the band set out on an all-Slovenian stage expedition, playing nearly 80 live performances. In September 2001, their fourth video was recorded, &quot;Samo Edini&quot;, both in Slovenian and English. After the launch of the video, the &quot;Nord&quot; sales rose 80 percent.

In November 2001, Siddharta filled the Kodeljevo sports hall in Ljubljana, making it their largest sold-out concert to date.

In February 2002, Primož Majerič left the band. Formally, Siddharta continued their work without a bass player.

In Spring 2002, preparations for a remix album began. Many recognized Slovenian artists and DJs were invited to work on it, such as Laibach, DJ Umek, DJ Kanzyani, Jamirko, and McBrane. The remix album &quot;Silikon Delta&quot; was released in June 2002. Along with the album release, the &quot;Under Venus&quot; video – an animation video created by Testtube Productions – was launched, which won the never-before-awarded Viktor award for Best Video.

Siddharta won the Viktor 2001 award for Best Performer of the year and Studio City&#x27;s Bumerang award for Best Band of 2002.

The band concluded their &quot;Nord&quot; tour with a significant performance in Cankar Hall, supported by the RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra on 16 June 2002. The concert was aired live on national Radio Val 202, and the video recording was shown on national television.

At the end of October 2002, Siddharta recorded a commercial for Slovene mobile provider Mobitel, which aired on MTV Europe. For the commercial Siddharta&#x27;s remake of Vlado Kreslin&#x27;s song Od Višine Se Zvrti was used. In March 2003, Jani Hace became a full member of the band.

===&quot;Rh-&quot; (2003): Third album===
The band started their studio work in December 2002 and in July 2003, Siddharta and Multimedia Records, with whom they had released all of their previous albums, agreed to discontinue their cooperation. The band thanked Multimedia Records for the support received on their way and proceeded to work with KifKif Records, announcing the release of the new album.

The studio work lasted many months, during which they had worked with Peter Penko, Dali Strniša, Rok Golob and Žare Pak. On 13 August 2003, Siddharta&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Rh-&quot; was released with KifKif Records. The release of the album had been preceded by the single Rave. Directed by Petar Pašić, the video for Rave was recorded in Belgrade. The video was a success on national charts and was played on MTV within the World Chart Express. An English version of the album was recorded and released on Slovenian market as a special limited-edition album on 1 September 2003. The album was released in packages which resembled blood-bags, and they were placed in music stores on transfusion hangers. The special-edition album was released in 1,500 copies, which were sold out in a matter of days.

====Rh- tour====
A month after the release of their third studio album &quot;Rh-&quot;, Siddharta opened the &quot;Rh-&quot; tour with a concert on Ljubljana&#x27;s central football stadium, Stadion Bežigrad. On 13 September 2003, Siddharta, accompanied by the RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra and 60 dancers, played before a crowd of over 30,000 people.

The preparations for the project had begun months beforehand, from careful stage-planning to the choreography and music arrangements for the orchestra. The choreography was directed by Miha Krušič (choreographer for the Go Easy video) and the music arrangements to Milko Lazar and Slavko Avsenik Jr (who had previously worked on the arrangements for the 2002 Križanke concert).

Playing two to three times a week, the &quot;Rh-&quot; tour visited all parts of the country, took a detour to Austria for a day, and ended just after Christmas in a sold-out concert. The stadium concert was aired on both national radio and television in prime time during the New Year holidays. It received a positive response from the media and was labelled event of the year 2003 numerous times.

===MTV and other awards===
In February 2004, MTV Europe chose to use Siddharta&#x27;s My Dice for the new music chart show The Rock Chart jingle. 

In March 2004, the special-edition Rh- packaging and its designer, Sašo Dornik, won the Grand award of the 13th Slovene Advertising Festival (SOF) in the category of miscellaneous means of advertising.

At 2004 Viktor awards, Siddharta won: the fan-voted Popularity Viktor and the Viktor award for Special Achievements, a public recognition of the stadium concert success.

The special-edition &quot;Rh-&quot; packaging had a new success at the Magdalena International Festival of Creative Communication; in the category of Other Means of Communication, the international jury presented its creator Sašo Dornik with first prize, the Golden Bra award.

In June 2004 Menart Records presented to their bands achievements and popularity awards. Siddharta won the highest possible recognition of sales in Slovenia named a Diamond record. Siddharta expressed their deep gratitude to their devoted fans for all the support they had received from them.

Siddharta&#x27;s special-edition CD bloodbag package has been entered to the Cresta (the world&#x27;s most prestigious designer and advertising awards program) short-list of finalists.

After its world premiere on Monday 13 September 2004, Siddharta&#x27;s latest video &#x27;My Dice&#x27; was aired exclusively on MTV Europe for a week, also marked by being MTV&#x27;s Artist of the Week. Since 20 September it had also been aired on other music TV stations, and the &#x27;My Dice&#x27; single aired on radio stations across Europe.

Siddharta decided to go on a mini tour across Slovenia at the end of 2004.

===MTV EMA===
Spring 2005 brought the release of the international Rh- album and new public recognitions. Siddharta was voted another Band-of-the-Year Viktor award by their domestic audience and received a nomination for MTV&#x27;s Europe Music Award (EMA). From the EMA awards show in Lisbon, Siddharta returned with an EMA of their own: the Best Adriatic Act EMA 2005.

===&quot;Rh-&quot; (English, 2005)===
The English version of Rh-, which had already been released as the bloodbag limited edition in 2003, was remade and re-released internationally in spring 2005. The lyrics had been altered and a vocal coach hired.

The album was released in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Croatia and Slovenia in two different versions: the regular English edition and the special edition with a bonus DVD. The DVD included Siddharta&#x27;s videos Rave, Insane and My Dice, making-of documentaries, live videos recorded at their stadium concerts, band photos and an exclusive interview, in which the band presented their own view of their music of the past, present and future, the music scene in the band&#x27;s home country, Slovenia, their music influences, their fan base, their past albums and plans for the future. They took some time to reflect on their creative process and the way they felt it would change for the next album. They described it as going back to their roots.

Both covers were designed by the award-winning Sašo Dornik and his Ventilator team. For the special edition, a different concept than the one that was used for the regular edition was used. 

Reviews from many places around the world were favourable and positive. 

In the summer 2005, the band went on their first abroad tour, a club tour across Germany. The band&#x27;s fan base grew by the show and their satisfaction peaked in performing before a club full of German fans in Berlin.

The band performed at large national music festivals such as Rock Otočec and Piše se leto in 2005. Fan votes won Siddharta the fourth popularity Viktor. 

In 2005, Siddharta performed for the first time before an international audience at the Exit festival in Novi Sad, Serbia.

Siddharta received their first international recognition for their work: in Lisbon, Portugal they were awarded their first MTV European Music Award (EMA) for Best Act in November 2005. 

===&quot;Petrolea&quot; (2006): Fourth album===
Almost three years after the release of their last studio album, Siddharta returned with Petrolea, an album much different in sound and arrangement from its symphony-based predecessor. A selection of domestic and foreign studios, combined with the experienced ear of Žare Pak and the musical perfectionism of the band members offered Slovenia an album marked by many a critic as album of the year 2006.

Siddharta performed an opening concert at the Ljubljana Castle during 2006.

Autumn 2006 was spent on the road, as Siddharta played 22 indoor concerts and a tour-closing concert in Ljubljana&#x27;s Prešeren Square just before the new year. The latter was filmed by national TV stations in order to air it a few days afterwards. Young promising Slovene bands opened for Siddharta throughout the tour. 

The band was yet again nominated for the MTV EMA, and it received the Viktor award for Artist of the Year. It was at this Viktor awards show that Siddharta and Dan D premiered in performing &quot;Male Roke / Voda&quot;. The hit remained on top of music charts for most of 2007.

The spring of 2007 was spent performing concerts. Over 30 shows, among these one for Slovenes living in Italy and one for those in Vienna, were performed. They played at most Slovenian summer festivals.

===Male Roke (EP, 2007)===
Siddharta&#x27;s cooperation with Dan D was marked by the release of the Male Roke EP, which included the aforementioned duet, the original title song and four live numbers. As with the Petrolea cover design, the Male Roke cover design was designed by Sašo Dornik and his Ventilator creative group.

===Izštekani (live – unplugged, 2007)===
Eight years after their first performance on the radio show Izštekani (Unplugged), hosted by Jure Longyka, Siddharta were invited to perform live for a second time. The acoustic versions of selected numbers from all four albums were later released as a CD + bonus DVD. The CD contained the performed songs only, while the DVD featured the whole show recorded live on camera.

===Maraton (live, 2007)===
Siddharta performed in Ljubljana&#x27;s Hala Tivoli, with the show selling out within a couple of weeks. The band – with assistance from other musicians – performed their whole set-list, a total of 56 songs, and was on stage for around 5 hours. Siddharta&#x27;s first bass player Primož Majerič, Big Foot Mama&#x27;s singer Grega Skočir, rapper Nikolovski, legend of Slovenian rock music Vlado Kreslin and string quartet Godalika joined them on stage.

The concert was released in December as a collection of four CDs with a bonus DVD, which featured a documentary on the occurrences both within and outside the hall, both before and during the Marathon concert. The documentary was shot and cut by Dafne Jemeršič.

===Saga (2009): Fifth album===
In the spring of 2008, Siddharta released a video for their song, Autumn Sun. The song had been only known and available as its own remix from the 2002 Silikon Delta album of remixes prior to this. 

Cene Resnik, after over ten years as a member of Siddharta, left the band to pursue a solo artist career.

On 19 December 2008 they released an EP entitled &quot;Vojna idej&quot; (lit. War of Ideas, English title &quot;Battle of Bombay&quot;).

Ross Robinson produced the new album&quot;, Saga&quot;, which was released on 21 November 2009 with a promotional concert in Kino Šiška.

===Siddharta &amp; RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra (2013)===
In 2013, the band released a double CD and DVD live album of their performance on June 17 and 18, 2013 in Cankarjev dom with the RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra.

===Ultra (2015)===
In December 2015, they released their 8th studio album, &quot;Ultra&quot;.

<doc id="1121429" wikidata="Q720450" url="?curid=1121429" title="Avram Iancu">
<text>Avram Iancu (; ; 1824 – September 10, 1872) was a Transylvanian Romanian lawyer who played an important role in the local chapter of the Austrian Empire Revolutions of 1848–1849. He was especially active in the Țara Moților region and the Apuseni Mountains. The rallying of peasants around him, as well as the allegiance he paid to the Habsburg monarchy, earned him the moniker &quot;Crăișorul Munților&quot; (&quot;The Prince of the Mountains&quot;). He was among the organizers of the 1848–1849 massacres in Transylvania that happened during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, during which 7,500–8,500 Hungarians, 4,400–6,000 Romanians, and about 500 Transylvanian Saxons, Armenians, Jews, and members of other groups were killed. 

== Early life ==
Avram Iancu was born in Vidra de Sus (currently Avram Iancu, Alba County), Transylvania, then part of the Austrian Empire into a family of peasants that had been emancipated from serfdom. His father was Alisandru Iancu (1787–1855) and his mother was Maria Gligor. He had one elder brother, Ion (born 1822), who became a priest.

Avram Iancu&#x27;s grandfather was Gheorghe Iancu (deceased before 1812), who had seven children: four girls – Sântioana, Maria, Zamfira and Ana, and three boys – Alisandru (the father), Avram, and Ioan. Little is known today about Avram Iancu&#x27;s childhood. It is known, by local tradition, that he had a typical moț character, joyful and witty and he had a musical talent, playing the leaf, alphorn, flute, and violin.

Avram Iancu attended primary school in his village, in the Târsa hamlet. His teacher was Mihai Gomboș. After a while, he was sent by his parents at the school in Neagra (now Poiana Vadului) village. Further, he attended the school from Câmpeni, Alba County, his teacher being Mihai Ioanette. He graduated the Câmpeni school at age 13.

After this, he went to school in Zlatna, where he studied in a Hungarian school, in the Latin language, as Romanian schools didn&#x27;t exist in this area. His teachers were Iozephus Stanken (1837–1838), Gregorius Iakabus (1838–1839) and Ludovicus Kovács (1839–1840 and 1840–1841). He graduated at age 17. He studied humanities from 1841, in the Piarist College of Cluj, graduating law school.

== Initial stages of 1848 Revolutions ==

Avram Iancu became a law clerk in Târgu Mureș, and it was there that he learned about the events of March 1848 of Vienna and Pest. His attitude at the time showed the nature of the conflict that was to engulf Transylvania: while Iancu welcomed the transition, he was indignant at the fact that Hungarian revolutionaries (many of whom were landowners) refused to debate the abolition of serfdom (which at the time was the state of the larger part of the Romanian population in Transylvania).

In the Apuseni Mountains, he started rallying peasants in Câmpeni. The protests he organized were recognized as peaceful by the authorities, but nevertheless worried them. Iancu and his associate Ioan Buteanu quickly became the main figures of the Romanian-led actions in the area, especially after they took part in the Blaj Assemblies starting in April, where over 40,000 Romanians met to protest against Transylvania becoming a part of Hungary. In Blaj (; ) both opted for the main, radical wing of the movement. Centered on Alexandru Papiu Ilarian, the group opposed the Hungarian revolutionary option of uniting Transylvania and Hungary. It got into conflict with the minority wing around Greek-Catholic Bishop Ioan Lemeni, one which chose not to boycott the elections for the Hungarian Parliament.

While the union was carried of on May 30, 1848, the majority of Romanian activists looked towards Vienna and Emperor Ferdinand, sharing the cause of the Transylvanian Saxons. Things became heated after July 11, when Hungary declared its independence. Austria started to open itself to the Romanian demands, while bloody conflicts ensued between the Hungarian nobles and their Romanian serfs. The last Assembly in Blaj saw the Habsburg governor, Anton Freiherr von Puchner, approve of the arming of National Guards for Romanians and Saxons. On September 27, the lynching of Austrian plenipotentiary Count Lamberg by a Pest crowd cut off any dialogue between the two centers. The new Emperor Franz Joseph and the Austrian government granted the Romanians numerous liberties and rights; although Lajos Kossuth&#x27;s government abolished serfdom, this was no longer a match for the Imperial offer.

== Conflict ==

=== Outbreak ===
The Austrians clearly rejected the October demand that the ethnical criteria become the basis for internal borders, with the goal of creating a province for Romanians (Transylvania grouped alongside Banat and Bukovina), as they did not want to replace the threat of Hungarian nationalism with the potential of Romanian separatism. Yet they did not declare themselves hostile to the rapid creation of Romanian administrative offices within Transylvania.

The territory was organized in (&quot;prefectures&quot;), with Avram Iancu and Buteanu as two prefects in the Apuseni. Iancu&#x27;s prefecture, the &quot;Auraria Gemina&quot; (a name charged with Latin symbolism), became the most important one as it took over from bordering areas that were never really fully organized.

In the same month, the administrative efforts were put to a halt, as Hungarians under Józef Bem carried out a sweeping offensive through Transylvania. With the discreet assistance of Imperial Russian troops, the Austrian army (except for the garrisons at Alba Iulia and Deva) and the Austrian-Romanian administration retreated to Wallachia and Wallachian Oltenia (both were, at the time, under Russia&#x27;s occupation).

=== Attrition ===
On 8 November, Avram Iancu, along with his 4,000 combatants of the &quot;Auraria Gemina&quot; Legion took part in joint military actions with Austrian forces. The Legion reached Turda, and the city surrendered without a fight on 20 November. Then, he and his troops returned to the mountains. On 29 November, Avram Iancu had another 1,500 troops mobilized for action. On 4 December, he reached Săcuieu, and on 6–7 December, he and his men were ordered to attack the enemy lines by surprise. However, the attack failed, due to the incompetence of an Austrian officer, and the Romanians were forced to withdraw by 10 December. By early January 1849, the control over Transylvania was almost entirely regained by the Hungarian Army. The Romanian fighters holding out in their mountains stronghold were running low of supplies, having only 800 rifles to arm a few thousand men, and were completely surrounded by Hungarian troops by the end of March.

In April 1849, Iancu was approached by the Hungarian envoy (in fact, a Romanian deputy in the Hungarian Parliament). Dragoș appeared to have been acting out of his own desire for peace, since Iancu&#x27;s troops were tying down too many Hungarian troops, about 10,000, a third of the Hungarian Army in Transylvania, according to Hungarian general János Czetz. He worked hard to get the Romanian leaders to meet him in Abrud and listen to the Hungarian demands. Iancu&#x27;s direct adversary, Hungarian commander , seems to have taken advantage of the provisional armistice to attack the Romanians in Abrud. He did not, however, benefit from a surprise, as Iancu and his men retreated and then encircled him. Meanwhile, Dragoș was lynched by the Abrud crowds, in the belief that he was part of Hatvany&#x27;s ruse.

Hatvany also angered the Romanians by having Buteanu captured and murdered. While his position became weaker, he was permanently attacked by Iancu&#x27;s men, until the major defeat of May 22. Hatvany and most of his armed group were massacred by their adversaries, as Iancu captured their cannons, switching the tactical advantage for the next months. Hatvany&#x27;s troops lost 5,000 soldiers and all of their artillery. Kossuth was angered by Hatvany&#x27;s gesture (an inspection of the time dismissed all of Hatvany&#x27;s close collaborators), especially since it made future negotiations unlikely.

On 8 June, the Romanian stronghold in the mountains was attacked by the largest Hungarian force yet: 4,000 men supported by 19 cannons led by General . The battle lasted between 11 and 17 June and ended in a crushing victory for the Romanians, the Hungarians having at least 500 troops killed during the battle.

The Russian intervention in June precipitated events, especially since Poles fighting in the Hungarian revolutionary contingents wanted to see an all-out resistance to the Tsarist armies. People like Henryk Dembiński mediated for an understanding between Kossuth and the Wallachian émigré revolutionaries. The latter, understandably close to Avram Iancu (especially Nicolae Bălcescu, Gheorghe Magheru, Alexandru G. Golescu, and Ion Ghica) were also keen to inflict a defeat on the Russian armies that had crushed their movement in September 1848. Fighting also continued in July, during the peace negotiations, on 2, 4, and 22 July, all Hungarian attacks being repulsed yet again. Finally, the conflict ended on 29 July, as Avram Iancu offered a guarantee to the Hungarian troops that he would not attack them, allowing them to withdraw in front of the Austro-Russian offensive.

=== Negotiations ===
Bălcescu and Kossuth met in May 1849, in Debrecen. The contact has for long been celebrated by Romanian Marxist historians and politicians: Karl Marx&#x27;s condemnation of everything opposing Kossuth had led to any Romanian initiative being automatically considered &quot;&quot;reactionary&quot;. In fact, it appears that the agreement was in no way a pact: Kossuth meant to flatter the Wallachians, by getting them to champion the idea of Iancu&#x27;s armies leaving Transylvania for good, in order to help Bălcescu in Bucharest. While agreeing to mediate for peace, Bălcescu never presented these terms to the fighters in the Apuseni Mountains. His personal documents (commented by ) show that the un-realistic assumptions of Kossuth had made him view the Hungarian leader as a &quot;demagogue&quot;&quot;.

Even more contradictory, the only thing Avram Iancu agreed to (and which no party had asked for) was his forces&#x27; &quot;neutrality&quot; in the conflict between Russia and Hungary. Thus, he secured his position as the Hungarian armies suffered defeats in July, culminating in the Battle of Segesvár (Sighișoara), and then the capitulation of August 13.

== Later years ==

Avram Iancu agreed to disarm as soon as the Austrians took over, and wrote in 1850 a detailed report to the new Governor of Transylvania, General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth. In order to avoid suspicion of Romanian separatism, the document does not mention the contacts with the Wallachians. As the Austrians granted the abolition of serfdom, they also forbade all representative institutions in Transylvania. While Hungarian nationalism was slowly fitting in the pattern that would make the &quot;Ausgleich&quot; acceptable for both sides involved, the Romanian option raised more and more irritation. The revolutionary zeal it had found under Iancu, although profiting the Monarchy, could also prove to be a weapon used for very different goals (the Austrians were especially fearful that the Orthodox faith of the Romanians would accommodate itself with Pan-Slavism, completing the gap between Serbia and the Russian Empire).

It is very possible that Iancu was not able to properly observe the new status quo. While the decision for his initial arrest (in December 1849) was quickly overturned after local protests (and explained as an abuse), he was censored throughout his life, had his library confiscated, and was placed under surveillance. He was even arrested a second time, in 1852, after it was presumed that his presence alone served to inflame local sentiments. Local traditions hold that the emperor Franz Joseph was visiting Transylvania and on July 21, 1852, he was in the Apuseni Mountains area, purportedly to attend The Maidens&#x27; Fair on Găina Mountain but also hoping that Iancu would agree to meet him. Allegedly, Iancu refused, uttering his famous line &quot;It&#x27;s all for naught, a madman and a liar can&#x27;t by any means come to understand each other&quot;. Soon after his release, Iancu visited Vienna and attempted to petition the Emperor. He was prevented to do so by the police, a public humiliation which provoked a nervous breakdown that had an impact on the rest of his life. He was marginalized by the authorities who didn&#x27;t allow Romanians to have their own say in Transylvania about their own autonomy. Being treated as peripheral by the people in power, he spent the rest of his life traveling the Apuseni Mountains, as a half-mad vagrant, living out of whatever alms that the impoverished moți population could spare for him, singing sad Romanian doina songs on his flute.
Avram Iancu died on September 10, 1872, at Baia de Criș. His body was buried, according to his wish, under Horea&#x27;s tree in Țebea (by tradition, the place where the Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan had started).

Avram Iancu was officially declared a &quot;Hero of the Romanian Nation&quot; in November 2016 by the Parliament of Romania and President Klaus Iohannis. The international airport serving the city of Cluj-Napoca has been named in his honor.

<doc id="1121430" wikidata="Q2917150" url="?curid=1121430" title="Ralph Allen">
<text>Ralph Allen ( – 29 June 1764) was a British postmaster, merchant and philanthropist best known for his reforms to Britain&#x27;s postal system. Born in St Columb Major, Cornwall, he moved to Bath, Somerset to work in the municipal post office, becoming its postmaster by 1712. Allen made the system more efficient and took over contracts for the British mail service to cover areas of England up to the Anglo-Scottish border and into South Wales. 

He purchased local stone mines from his postal profits and had Prior Park built as his country house to show off the versatility of Bath stone, using the old post office as his townhouse. Working alongside architect John Wood, the Elder, the stone Allen mined was heavily used in construction work for development works in Bath. However, the mines did not consistently make a profit and he subsidised them from his postal profits. 

After his death, he was buried in a pyramid-topped tomb in Claverton, Somerset. Allen is commemorated in the names of streets and schools in the city of Bath and was the model for the character of Squire Allworthy in the 1749 novel &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; by Henry Fielding.

==Early life==

Much is unknown or obscure regarding Allen&#x27;s early life. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; gives his father as Philip Allen, reputed to be an innkeeper. As a teenager, Allen worked at the Post Office at St Columb, run by his grandmother. He moved in 1710 to Bath, where he became a post office clerk, and at the age of 19, in 1712, became the Postmaster of Bath. In 1742 he was elected Mayor of Bath.

==Involvement in the postal system==

At the age of 27, Allen took control of the Cross and Bye Posts in the South West under a seven-year contract with the General Post Office, although he had no official title. At the end of this period he had not made a profit, only breaking even, but he had the courage to continue.

Over the next few years, he reformed the postal service. He realised that post boys were delivering items of mail along their route without them being declared and that this was lost profit. He introduced a &quot;signed for&quot; system that prevented the malpractice. He also improved efficiency by not requiring mail to go via London.

Allen&#x27;s reputation grew and he took over more and more of the English postal system, signing contracts every seven years until he died aged 71. It is estimated that he saved the Post Office £1,500,000 over a 40-year period. He won the patronage of General Wade in 1715, when he disclosed details of a Jacobite uprising in Cornwall.

==Bath stone and his residences==
With the arrival of John Wood in Bath, Allen used the wealth gained from his postal reforms to acquire the stone quarries at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines. Hitherto, the quarry masons had always hewn stone roughly providing blocks of varying size. The resulting uneven surface is known as &quot;rubble&quot; and buildings of this type – built during the Stuart period – are visible throughout the older parts of Bath.

The distinctive honey-coloured Bath stone, used to build the Georgian city, made Allen a second fortune. The building in Lilliput Alley, Bath (now North Parade Passage), which he used as a post office, became his town house and in 1727 he refronted the southern rubble wall, extended the house to the north and added a new storey. John Wood the Elder refers to this in his &quot;Essay towards the future of Bath&quot;. Allen was astute at marketing the qualities of Bath stone and erected an elaborately ornate building a few feet to the north of his house to demonstrate its qualities. The extension (as Wood refers to it) has become known as &quot;Ralph Allen&#x27;s Town House&quot;, though whether it was designed by Wood is unproven and many local historians consider it unlikely. Allen continued to live there until 1745, when he moved to Prior Park, and the town house became his offices.

Allen had the Palladian mansion of Prior Park built (1742) on a hill overlooking the city, &quot;To see all Bath, and for all Bath to see&quot;. He gave money and the stone for the building of the Mineral Water Hospital in central Bath 1738. In 1758 he bought Claverton Manor, just east of Bath.

Allen had a summer home built in the coastal town of Weymouth in Dorset, overlooking the harbour at number 2 Trinity Street, opposite the Customs House. There is a plaque on the house to commemorate Allen. His Bath stone was used in the Georgian buildings of Weymouth.

==Commemoration==
After Allen died in Bath on 29 June 1764, he was buried in a pyramid-topped tomb in Claverton churchyard, on the outskirts of the city. A marble bust stood in the Mineral Water Hospital (later the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases) and was moved to the hospital&#x27;s new building at Combe Park in 2019.

His name is commemorated in Ralph Allen Drive which runs past his former home at Prior Park. Now a busy road from Combe Down village to Bath city centre, this was the route by which the stone from his quarries at Combe Down was sent on wooden sledges down to the River Avon. Prior Park College, a private school for 11- to 18-year-olds, is housed in Allen&#x27;s former home and incorporates a boys&#x27; boarding house named Allen House. The Prior Park Landscape Garden and Palladian bridge are cared for by the National Trust, who brought the garden back from dereliction in 1993. He is also remembered in Ralph Allen School, one of the city&#x27;s state secondary schools.

The Ralph Allen CornerStone in Combe Down village opened in the autumn of 2013. This houses the archives of the Combe Down Heritage Society and provides a community hub and information centre as part of the legacy of the project to infill the stone mines underneath the village. Writer Henry Fielding used Allen as the model for Squire Allworthy in the 1749 novel &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot;.

<doc id="1121432" wikidata="Q7268608" url="?curid=1121432" title="Quaking Houses">
<text>Quaking Houses is a small village near to the town of Stanley in County Durham, in England. It may have been originally settled by Quakers, but during the Industrial Revolution it developed into a mining village with traditional terraced houses. The Quaker origin is supported by the 1873 name for a mine with two shafts at the village called Quaker House Pit. However, an alternative origin is suggested by the following; the 1865 OS Map shows a farm called Quaking House to the north at Anfield Plain and a colliery railway line ran past this farm branching to the village mine. This colliery railway line was called the Quaking House Branch Line. A colloquial name for the village was &quot;nanny goat island&quot; perhaps reflecting the livestock kept in the extensive allotments and grazing area around the village.

Accessible by road only from the main South Moor Road, the village is dominated by one large road, with large strips of terraced housing on either side, both facing outwards. The large road is divided into several different street names: Third Street and Fourth Street, with Woodside Terrace and Fellside Terrace located at the west end. A large turning circle enables large vehicles, particularly buses, to change direction.

A shorter road parallel to the large road once had two streets, First Street and Second Street. The Community Hall which opened in 1997 stands where First street was once situated and Second Street still remains. The original housing stock was tied property which passed to the National Coal Board following nationalisation of the coal industry. The properties in Fellside and Woodside Terrace were larger than the other properties and were originally occupied by people with &quot;middle management&quot; occupations in the mining industry.

At one time at the bottom of Fourth Street stood a walled reservoir and at the top of the village on the fell in the woodland was a dam, both of which had been required for the mines in the area. The William Pit, colloquially known as the Billy Pit, and which, prior to nationalisation, was owned by the South Moor and Holmside Colliery Company [SM&amp;HCC] stood near the reservoir. SM&amp;HCC also operated a drift mine in the Stanley Burn valley to the north of Woodside Terrace.

<doc id="1121433" wikidata="Q6859228" url="?curid=1121433" title="Miller Range">
<text>The Miller Range () is a mountain range extending south from Nimrod Glacier for along the western edge of the Marsh Glacier in Antarctica.


==Name==

The range is named for J.H. &quot;Bob&quot;, now Sir Joseph Holmes Miller, a member of the New Zealand party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1958) who, with G.W. Marsh, mapped this area.

==Location==

The Miller Range is in the Transantarctic Mountains to the east of the Ross Ice Shelf.
It runs from north to south, and is about long and up to wide.
The maximum elevation above the ice sheet is about .
There are signs of glaciation on the highest points of the range.

The Miller Range is separated by about from the adjacent ranges of the Transantarctic Mountains by the Nimrod and Marsh glaciers.
The Marsh Glacier to the east and Nimrod Glacier to the west both flow north and converge just north of the range.
The Queen Elizabeth Range is east of the Miller Range, on the other side of Marsh Glacier.
The Cobham Range is to the northeast and the Geologists Range to the northwest, both on the other side of the Nimrod Glacier.

==Geology==

The Miller Range was part of the Mawson Continent.
There is evidence that suggests that the Miller Range terrain was accreted to the Gawler–Adélie Craton during the 1730–1690 Ma Kimban–Nimrod Orogeny, with a suture zone that may be at or near the location of the Nimrod Group.

The range is in the Beardmore-Nimrod Glacier area, which has a basement complex of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.
This is unconformably overlain by a thick sequence of sedimentary rocks, mostly from the Devonian to Triassic and of continental origin.
The Miller Range differs from its neighbors in being composed only of the basement complex, which holds regional metamorphic rocks of the Nimrod Group, with Hope Granite intrusions.
Metamorphic rocks of the Nimrod Group include mica schists, metaquartzites, banded gneisses, augen gneisses and marbles, all mostly derived from sedimentary sources, and amphibolites derived from basaltic rocks.

==Glaciers==

The Marsh Glacier lies to the east and Nimrod Glacier to the west, both of which flow north and converge just north of the range.
Argo Glacier, which flows east into Marsh Glacier, divides the southern part of the range from the central part.
Argosy Glacier, fed from the south by Ascent Glacier, also flows east into Marsh Glacier, and divides the central part of the range from the northern part.
Skua Glacier and Astro Glacier flow northeast through the northern portion of the range into Marsh Glacier.

==Cirques==

===Dike Cirque===
A semi-circular glacial cirque wide in the Miller Range. 
It is carved into Macdonald Bluffs at the southeast base of Kreiling Mesa. 
So named by the Ohio State University Geological Party of 1967–68, because the granite cliffs surrounding the cirque are cut by numerous black dikes.

===Hockey Cirque===
A glacial cirque wide along the east wall of Ascent Glacier in the Miller Range. 
It was named by the Ohio State University Geological Party of 1967–68 because the cirque was the scene of a game of ice hockey.

===Strawberry Cirque===
A semi-circular glacial cirque, wide, at the south end of Macdonald Bluffs in Miller Range. It indents the cliff, at the north side of the terminus of Argo Glacier where the latter enters Marsh Glacier. So named by the Ohio State University Geological Party, 1967-68, because the granite cliffs of the cirque have a bright pink to red color in certain lighting.

==Southern section==

The southern section is to the south of Argo Glacier.

===Gerard Bluffs===
Prominent ice-free bluffs marking the southern extremity of the Miller Range. Mapped in December 1957, and named by the New Zealand southern party of the CTAE (1956-58) for V. Gerard, IGY scientist at Scott Base in 1957.

===Augen Bluffs===
Rock bluffs between Orr Peak and Isocline Hill along the west side of Marsh Glacier, in the Miller Range. 
So named by the Ohio State University Geological Party, 1967-68, because rocks of the locality include augengneiss.

===Isocline Hill===
A hill in the south part of Augen Bluffs, Miller Range. The hill rises above the west side of Marsh Glacier and is connected to Augen Bluffs by a col lower than the height of the hill. 
So named by the Ohio State University Geological Party of 1967–68 because an isoclinal fold is well exposed on the side of the hill.

===Orr Peak===
A peak in the Miller Range overlooking Marsh Glacier, forming the eastern salient in the bluffs southward of Argo Glacier.
Observed in December 1957 by the New Zealand Southern Party of the CTAE (1956-58). 
Named for H. Orr, IGY scientist at Scott Base in 1957.

==Central section==

The Central section is between Argo Glacier and Argosy Glacier.

===Milan Ridge===
A mainly ice-free ridge, long, bordering the west side of Ascent Glacier in the Miller Range. 
Named by US-ACAN for Frederick M. Milan, physiologist at Little America V, 1957.

===Greene Ridge===
A partially ice-covered ridge, long, extending northward from Martin Dome to the southern edge of Argosy Glacier in the Miller Range. Named by US-ACAN after Charles R. Greene, Jr., USARP ionospheric scientist at the South Pole Station, 1958.

===Martin Dome===
An elevated, snow-covered prominence between Argosy Glacier and Argo Glacier in the Miller Range. 
Sighted in December 1957 by the New Zealand Southern Party of the CTAE. Named for L. Martin, leader at Scott Base in 1958. Not: Martins Dome.

===Ong Valley===
A mainly ice-free valley long, just west of Kreiling Mesa in the Miller Range. 
Named by US-AC AN for John S. Ong, USARP traverse engineer on the South Pole Traverse (1962-63).

===Macdonald Bluffs===
Prominent east-facing bluffs between Argosy and Argo Glaciers in the Miller Range, descending to the Marsh Glacier. 
Mapped by the New Zealand Southern Party of the CTAE (1956-58) and named for W.J.P. Macdonald, IGY scientist at Scott Base in 1957. Not: Macdonald Cliffs.

===Kreiling Mesa===
A distinctive, partially ice-covered mesa at the S side of the mouth of Argosy Glacier in the Miller Range. Named by US-ACAN for Lee W. Kreiling, USARP traverse engineer at NAF McMurdo, winter 1961, Ellsworth Land Traverse, 1961-62, and Roosevelt Island, 1962-63.

==Northern Section==

The Northern section is to the north of Argosy Glacier.

===Aurora Heights===
Prominent heights long, bordering the north side of Argosy Glacier. Named by the NZGSAE (1961–62) for the Aurora, the ship of the Ross Sea Party of the British Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914-17).

===Lookout Dome===
An ice-covered, dome-shaped mountain, high. 
So named by the NZGSAE (1961-62) because its heights offer an extensive view of Nimrod Glacier and were used as a survey station.

===Turner Hills===
A group of hills between Astro Glacier and Nimrod Glacier in the northwest part of the Miller Range. 
Mapped by the USGS from tellurometer surveys and Navy air photos, 1960-62. 
Named by US-ACAN for Dr. Mort D. Turner of the National Science Foundation who has been Program Manager for Polar Earth Sciences, Division of Polar Programs, since 1959. Turner studied the geology of the dry valley areas near McMurdo Sound, 1959-60, and in several subsequent seasons served as USARP Representative in Antarctica.

===Tricorn Peak===
Snow-covered peak, 2,320 m, on the ridge between Astro Glacier and Skua Glacier. 
Seen by the northern party of the NZGSAE (1961-62) and so named because of its resemblance to a three-cornered hat.

===Snowshoe Pass===
A snow saddle northeast of Aurora Heights, between Argosy and Skua Glaciers. 
Discovered and named by the northern party of NZGSAE (1961-62), who found the deep soft snow here made snowshoeing the best method of travel.

===Rust Bluff===
A small bluff or promontory on the east side of Miller Range, overlooking Marsh Glacier south of Corner Nunatak. 
Named by US-ACAN for Izak C. Rust, professor of geology, University of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. 
Rust was international exchange scientist with the Ohio State University Geological Expedition, 1969–70, and with John Gunner collected geological samples at this bluff.

===Corner Nunatak===
A nunatak at the extreme northeast corner of the Miller Range, between Nimrod Glacier and Marsh Glacier. 
Named by the northern party of the NZGSAE (1961-62). Not: Corner Peak.

<text>South Moor is a village in the civil parish of Stanley, in County Durham, England. It is located to the south-west of Stanley on the northern slope of the Craghead valley. It is a well-developed village, yet still semi-rural, containing a main street (Park Road) of around twelve shops which survive despite their proximity to the front street of Stanley and its Asda supermarket.

There was a branch of Stanley Co-op at the bottom of Park Rd and a glove factory above it. On the opposite side in a walled garden stood the Colliery Offices for the district. A local meeting place for teenagers in the 1950s and 1960s was Boves café which had a jukebox and sold coffee and snacks. The proprietor also had an ice cream factory around the back of the shop and vans travel about to this day selling to the public. The café is now home to an award-winning Indian restaurant The Monju Tandoori, which has been established since 1987. There is a local church, St. Georges at the bottom of South Moor and &quot;The Woodland Tavern&quot; once was the Miners Hall.

== South Moor Park ==
South Moor Park is located at the bottom of the valley between Oxhill, and the small village of Quaking Houses. Alongside the large gates which denote the entrance to the park are names of local people who died during World War I. Two names, however, were deleted when it was discovered that the &#x27;victims&#x27; had not actually died.
A stream passes through the park. The section of the park adjacent to Park Road features a bowling green and a public, concrete tennis court. Recent new development in the area has meant that the park is now undergoing refurbishment work.

The west side of the park is completely wooded. The main path follows the course of the stream. The remains of the bandstand is hidden by trees and growth and the remains of a previous paddling pool could be seen opposite the bandstand. This was well used in the 1930s by locals.

== Governance ==
On 30 September 1894 South Moor became a civil parish, being formed from the part of Lanchester in Stanley urban district, on 1 October 1916 the parish was abolished and merged with Stanley. In 1911 the parish had a population of 4054.

<doc id="1121446" wikidata="Q7115620" url="?curid=1121446" title="Oxhill, County Durham">
<text>Oxhill is a small village in the civil parish of Stanley, in County Durham, England. It is located to the west of Stanley, on the bottom of the hill which leads up to New Kyo and Annfield Plain to its east. Down the hill to the north are the C2C cycle path, East Kyo and Harperley. Oxhill contains very little: a few households, a pub called The Ox (frequented by locals and occasional cyclists from the nearby C2C cycle path taking lunch - the pub used to be known for weekend live music as well as food) and the main nursery school for the Stanley area.



Opposite the &quot;Ox Inn&quot; to the south west is the former &quot;Oxhill Chapel&quot;. This has now been converted to a private house.

Oxhill used to be the site of a major level crossing, allowing access from the former nearby Stanhope and Tyne Railway line (this is now the basis of the eastern section of the &quot;C2C&quot; cycle path) to a shunting yard adjacent to nearby South Moor, where coal was loaded for transport to the River Tyne for export.

A small pond called &quot;Kyo Ox Pond&quot; or &quot;Kyo Tarn&quot;, 400 metres to the north of The Ox pub on the road to East Kyo and Harperley, was artificially created between the embankment of the Stanhope and Tyne Railway and adjoining hillside when it was converted to the C2C cycle path in the late 1980s (there is an old railway bridge just to the east). The origins of this Cumbrian-sounding name are unknown, though it may have been named as such due to the nearby (and possibly older) &quot;Greencroft Tarn&quot; and &quot;Quarzi Tarn&quot; ponds (also known locally as &quot;Greencroft Fishing Pond&quot; and &quot;Quarzi Pond&quot;) in Greencroft.

== Notable people ==
Hillary Clinton&#x27;s grandfather, Hugh Rodham, was born at Oxhill in 1879, the son of Jonathan Rodham, a coal miner living in the village. The family emigrated from here to the United States in the 1880s.


== Governance ==
On 30 September 1894 Oxhill became a civil parish, being formed from the part of Kyo in Stanley urban district, on 1 October 1916 the parish was abolished and merged with Stanley. In 1911 the parish had a population of 4436.

<text>The Nanjing Botanical Garden Memorial Sun Yat-Sen (), established in 1929, became the first national botanical garden in China. The original name, &#x27;Botanical Garden Memorial Sun Yat-Sen&#x27;, commemorated Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the pioneer of Chinese democratic revolution. In 1954, it was renamed as Nanjing Botanical Garden Mem. Sun Yat-Sen, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is one of four major botanical gardens in China. The botanical garden is also known as Zhongshan Botanical Garden after the spelling of its name in pinyin.

==Location==
Located in the eastern suburbs of Nanjing, with the Purple Mountain behind and the Qian Lake in front, the garden lies beside the ancient city wall of Ming Dynasty nearby the famous Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The gardens cover 1.86 square kilometers (186 ha). With luxuriant vegetation, lawns, hills and lakes, Nanjing Botanical Garden is a center for botanical research and science education, as well as a popular recreational attraction. CIty bus lines 20 and 315 stop at the front gate.

==Collection==
As a research center on central and northern subtropical floras of China, the garden has a living collection of about 3,000 species belonging to 913 genera of 188 families. The Herbarium holds 700,000 sheets of botanical specimens. There are five research departments: Ornamental Plant Research Center, Medicinal Plant Research Center, Plant Information Center, Key Laboratory of Plant Ex-situ Conservation of Jiangsu Province and the Herbarium. Ten featured gardens (sections) have been constructed and opened.

Nanjing Botanical Garden has set up an exchange program of seeds, plants, specimens and books with over six hundred organizations of more than sixty countries worldwide. The sister relationship of botanical gardens was established with the Missouri Botanical Garden, USA, which is the first of its type in China. Friendly relationships with the UBC Botanical Garden, Canada and the Botanical Garden, University of Tokyo, Japan have been set up. The garden is a member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Threatened Plant Committee and Botanic Gardens Conservation International.

==Transportation==
The garden is accessible north from Muxuyuan station () of Nanjing Metro Line 2. Take city bus 20 from this station. Or from the Jimingsi station () (Line 3) stops at the main entrance.

<text>British Airtours (stylised as British aırtours) was a charter airline in the United Kingdom with flight operations out of London Gatwick and Manchester Airports.

Established as BEA Airtours in 1969, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of British Airways (BA) following the merger between British European Airways (BEA) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in the early 1970s. British Airtours adopted the Caledonian Airways name when the newly British Airways completed the acquisition of the rival British Caledonian in April 1988. Caledonian Airways was eventually sold to tour operator Inspirations in 1995, marking BA&#x27;s exit from the mainstream inclusive tour market. In 1999, Thomas Cook acquired Inspirations and merged Caledonian Airways with Flying Colours to form JMC Air Services, a forerunner of the UK arm of the later Thomas Cook Airlines. On 23 September 2019, Thomas Cook Airlines ceased operations, thus ending the legacy of British Airtours.

==History==
===Origins===
BEA Airtours was formed on 24 April 1969 as a division of BEA to provide it with a low cost platform to participate in the then rapidly growing inclusive tour (IT) holiday flights market, which until then had been the exclusive domain of wholly privately owned airlines independent from the government-owned corporation BEA and BOAC. BEA saw this as a necessary counterweight to the independents&#x27; rapidly growing scheduled activities that began encroaching on what BEA and BOAC had traditionally regarded as their sole preserve. BEA Airtours&#x27; formation was in line with one of the recommendations of the Edwards Report on the future of British air industry – that the corporations should enter the inclusive tour and charter market.

The independent charter airlines were suspicious of BEA&#x27;s motive to enter the IT market and some feared that the operator held a hidden agenda to destabilise this market by undercutting the independent carriers, none of which could match the corporation&#x27;s financial resources and access to capital at the time. The independents moreover thought that BEA Airtours was meant to take on the corporations&#x27; excess staff as well as to absorb aircraft that were surplus to their requirements. They feared that this would lead to significant market distortions, creating excess capacity and further depressing the already low charter rates in a highly competitive market.

BEA&#x27;s new charter division had a startup capital of £250,000 and selected Gatwick Airport south of London to serve as its base, where it took over the former Transglobe Airways hangar to provide engineering support for its Gatwick fleet. During 1970, the airline commenced commercial operations out of Gatwick, initially using a fleet of seven second-hand ex-BEA de Havilland Comet series 4B aircraft which seated 109 passengers in a single-class configuration. On 6 March 1970, the first revenue flight departed Gatwick.

===Corporate changes and new services===
During 1971, BEA Airtours had decided to replace the entire fleet with a similar number of larger capacity, longer range and more fuel-efficient ex-American Airlines Boeing 707-123Bs to enable it to commence non-stop, long-haul charter flights, including affinity group charters to North America. Despite having obtained permission from the Department of Trade and Industry to import second-hand 707-120Bs and the non-availability of internally sourced alternatives (BOAC&#x27;s 707-436s) within the envisaged timeframe, both corporations opposed this decision. They insisted that any new aircraft should be exclusively sourced from the existing BEA and BOAC fleets.

Following the corporations&#x27; intervention, BEA Airtours acquired seven former BOAC Boeing 707-436s. These aircraft had a greater seating capacity than required and were powered by four Rolls-Royce Conway engines, an older generation engine type than the four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D turbofans which powered the ex-American 707-123Bs it had originally selected to replace its Comet fleet. This meant that the ex-BOAC 707s had higher operating costs. However, BOAC was prepared to sell these aircraft to BEA Airtours at a lower price than American was asking for its planes. The £4.3m sale price included BOAC&#x27;s entire spares holding (inclusive of engines) for the seven aircraft. This helped compensate for the cost differential. The first of these 174-seat aircraft entered service in 1971 while the last aircraft of this batch joined the fleet in 1973. By that time, four of the airline&#x27;s nine Comet 4Bs had already been withdrawn from service and sold to rival British charter airlines.

The 1973 oil crisis in the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, which led to a quadrupling of the price of a barrel of oil, substantially increased the operating costs of the remaining fuel-thirsty Comets and began to have an adverse impact on the airline&#x27;s financial performance. British Airtours, as the airline had become known following the establishment of British Airways in 1974 as a result of the 1972 BEA—BOAC merger, therefore decided to retire its remaining five Comets at the end of that year&#x27;s summer season and to sell the entire fleet to independent British operator Dan-Air.

In 1975, British Airtours commenced transatlantic Advance Booking Charter (ABC) flights to the United States. Over the coming years, British Airtours acquired additional Boeing 707s which British Airways had inherited from BOAC. In June 1982, British Airtours launched twice-weekly scheduled services between Gatwick and Newark using Boeing 707s in an all-economy configuration. However, the airline&#x27;s foray into the transatlantic scheduled market ended after only seven months in early January 1983.

When British Airways decided in the late-1970s to replace the aging and increasingly inefficient short-/medium-haul Hawker Siddeley Tridents and BAC One-Elevens which it had inherited from BEA with Boeing 737s and 757s, a follow-on order for nine brand-new 737-236 Advanced aircraft was placed with Boeing. These aircraft, which were delivered to British Airtours&#x27; Gatwick base during the early 1980s, allowed it to replace all of its old, second-hand narrow-bodied planes with brand-new equipment, thereby considerably enhancing its competitiveness vis-à-vis its independent rivals.

During 1984, British Airtours took delivery of a Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Boeing 747-236Bs at Gatwick, its first and only brand-new widebodied aircraft. This aircraft was put into service on the airline&#x27;s popular, long-haul ABC flights to North America. The same year, British Airtours&#x27; last Boeing 707 made its final revenue flight. In the meantime, British Airtours also began taking delivery of a small number of former British Airways Lockheed L-1011 Tristar widebodies, which initially supplemented its narrow-bodied 737 fleet on the busier and more popular routes. In 1985, British Airtours introduced a new livery that closely resembled the one used by British Airways at the time (designed by Landor Associates).

===Rebranding and later activity===
In April 1988, British Airtours adopted the popular Caledonian Airways brand when the newly privatised British Airways had completed the takeover of its former Gatwick-based rival British Caledonian. As an additional measure to signify the change, the airline also adopted a modified Caledonian livery which had been adapted from the contemporary, Landor Associates-designed British Airways livery. The newly rebranded Caledonian Airways transferred its Gatwick operation from the airport&#x27;s South Terminal into the then brand-new North Terminal, thereby concentrating the majority of the British Airways group&#x27;s Gatwick services within the new terminal.

Shortly thereafter, Caledonian Airways commenced the replacement of its Boeing 737 narrow-bodies with additional ex-British Airways L-1011 Tristar widebodies as well as with a number of brand-new Boeing 757s sourced from the large 757 orders placed by its parent company. The former British Airtours 737s were re-configured in British Airways&#x27; contemporary short-haul two-class cabin arrangement and began to replace the BAC One-Eleven 500s which British Airways had inherited from British Caledonian on the UK flag carrier&#x27;s short-haul Gatwick routes.

During 1995, British Airways decided to exit the short- to medium-haul package holiday market; accordingly, the airline sold Caledonian Airways to British-based tour operator &quot;Inspirations&quot;, which was then a part of the American-owned Carlson group, along with the firm&#x27;s core fleet of five Tristars. Following Caledonian&#x27;s sale to Inspirations, the Boeing 757s were returned to British Airways. During 1999, Inspirations became part of the Thomas Cook group when Caledonian Airways was merged with the Flying Colours airline to form JMC Air Services, which in turn became the British arm of the present day Thomas Cook Airlines. Following Inspirations&#x27; takeover by Thomas Cook, the remaining former Caledonian Airways Tristars were withdrawn from service as these had suffered increasing and widely publicised reliability problems which had resulted in a generally poor perception of Caledonian amongst the travelling public.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 17 March 1977, a Boeing 707-436, crashed soon after takeoff, injuring the 4 crew on board. The flight was a training session for three trainees at Glasgow Prestwick Airport. The cause was a delay of the pilots doing the correct procedures for a failing engine.
* On 27 May 1985, a Lockheed TriStar, G-BBAI, operating Flight 101, overran the runway at Leeds Bradford Airport on landing from Palma after a rain shower. The aircraft was evacuated, with only minor injuries sustained by the 14 crew and 398 passengers. The nose landing gear strut folded backwards during the overrun, leading to severe damage to the underside of the forward fuselage. The undersides of both wing-mounted engines were flattened and both engines suffered ingestion damage. The main wheels of the aircraft also dug deep troughs in the area beyond the end of the runway, damaging the buried airfield lighting cables. The accident report concluded that the overrun was caused by the inability of the aircraft to achieve the appropriate level of braking effectiveness, and recommended that both the scheduled wet runway performance of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the condition of the surface of runway 14 at Leeds Bradford Airport should be re-examined.
* On 22 August 1985, British Airtours Flight 28M caught fire after an aborted take off at Manchester Airport while on a charter flight to the Greek island of Corfu. The fuel access panel on the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage was pierced by a part of the compressor that had been ejected from the port engine as a result of a malfunction. The fire quickly engulfed the area around the rear of the plane filling the cabin with toxic fumes. Fifty-three passengers and two crew members died as a result – most of them dying of asphyxiation after inhaling the fumes.

==Preserved aircraft==

Boeing 707-436 G-APFJ was initially preserved at Royal Air Force Museum Cosford as the only surviving B707 with Rolls-Royce Conway engines. She was scrapped in 2006 and the forward fuselage section was donated to the National Museum of Flight in Scotland.

<text>The Shackleton Inlet is a reentrant, about 16 km (10 mi) wide, between Cape Wilson and Cape Lyttelton. It is occupied by the terminus of the Nimrod Glacier descending at a low gradient from the bordering highlands to the Ross Ice Shelf.

Discovered by Capt. Robert Falcon Scott, in December 1902, while on his attempted trip to the South Pole. He was accompanied on this trip by Dr. Edward A. Wilson and Lt. (later Sir) Ernest Shackleton, for whom this inlet was named.

<doc id="1121457" wikidata="Q1199856" url="?curid=1121457" title="The Tears">
<text>The Tears were an English rock supergroup formed in 2004 by ex-Suede bandmates Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler, along with the former Delicatessen and Lodger members Will Foster (keyboardist), bassist Nathan Fisher, and Bernard Butler session drummer Makoto Sakamoto. The duo Anderson and Butler were a much anticipated reunion and music critics praised their first concerts and only album, &quot;Here Come the Tears&quot;. However, the project was short-lived as they disbanded in 2006, which allowed Anderson to focus on his solo career and the latter Suede&#x27;s reformation in 2010, Butler became a full-time producer, and Foster worked as additional musician for the Fratellis since 2008.

==History==
In 1994, when Bernard Butler walked out of Suede, they were the biggest new band in Britain. He was pilloried in the music press and characterised as &quot;demanding, difficult and egotistical&quot; by Brett Anderson. &quot;When he left the band we pretty much hated each other as much as two people can hate each other,&quot; admitted Anderson in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;. The pair parted company in July 1994 while recording Suede&#x27;s second album &quot;Dog Man Star&quot;, which resulted in a major fallout due to musical differences and Anderson&#x27;s hedonistic lifestyle. As Suede soldiered on and Butler forged a solo career, both with varying degrees of success, they continued to snipe at each other in the press. Though Butler and Anderson had not spoken to each other for nine years, Anderson claimed getting back in touch with Butler was not difficult. The band decided on being named after a line from a Philip Larkin poem, &quot;Femmes Damnées&quot;, which ends with the line: &quot;The only sound heard is the sound of tears&quot;.

The band played their first ever live show on 14 December 2004 at the Oxford Zodiac. Things went as expected for the &quot;new&quot; band, and most new songs were received well by those attending the first set of shows. When asked during a concert by a fan to play Suede song, &quot;The Drowners&quot;, Anderson replied saying, &quot;Did somebody say they wanted to hear &quot;The Drowners&quot;? You’ve come to the wrong gig, mate.&quot;

Apart from relatively minor reviews of the first clutch of live shows, The Tears&#x27; first press was a review of &quot;Refugees&quot;, an interview with Anderson, and a poster in &quot;The Sun&quot; on 15 April. The next major article was by Alexis Petridis in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which ended on an extremely optimistic note: &quot;the pair seem artistically reinvigorated by each other&#x27;s company. Anderson talks excitedly of Tears songs like the ballad Asylum, inspired by his father&#x27;s struggle with depression, as having moved away from ‘Suede cliches or Brett Anderson cliches ... it&#x27;s not, you know, opiated fop territory.’&quot;

From the start, Anderson was insistent that the band would not be playing any songs by Suede. Things would change over time, however, as the band ended up playing the B-side, &quot;The Living Dead&quot;, to an enthusiastic reception, during an encore for their show at the Sheffield Leadmill in April. In April 2005, the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Refugees&quot;, was released. The single was a success and peaked in the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart.

The album, &quot;Here Come the Tears&quot; followed on 6 June 2005, which the album was recorded in secrecy during the entire of 2004. It was released to generally favourable reviews that helped solidify the duo&#x27;s comeback. However it failed to crack the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart. Anderson felt that the project was eclipsed by the curiosity in the reconciliation with Butler, saying: &quot;...the story of me and Bernard getting back together again was far too juicy, and it overshadowed the music completely. I am proud of the record we made, but the obsession with us stopped us enjoying it.&quot; In late June, the band played a set at the John Peel stage at the Glastonbury Festival. The second single from the debut album, entitled &quot;Lovers&quot;, was released in June. Though a significantly lower charting than the previous single, it still managed to reach number 24.

More than a month later, Anderson announced that he would release his long-awaited solo album in between the touring for &quot;Here Come the Tears&quot;, and the release of the band&#x27;s follow up album. After playing several festivals including Glastonbury and T in the Park along with international gigs, the band announced a European tour with dates in October and November. However, the tour was soon cancelled and the band were dropped from their label.

In late April 2006, Anderson posted a message on the band&#x27;s message board announcing the band were on temporary hiatus because &quot;no one ever wanted this thing to get caught up within the drudgery of the whole tour/record/tour cycle anyway&quot;. In addition, he announced that he had completed his debut solo album and that it would see light in early 2007, hinting that the second Tears record would most likely come after that. In August 2006, the band&#x27;s official site and forum were closed. In 2007, Anderson admitted in an interview that The Tears were about to write their second album, however they decided to split because they were simply not enjoying it. Asked about a second record, Anderson replied. &quot;The chance of there being another Tears record in the future is pretty good actually.&quot; These hopes were short-lived, however when Butler announced his retirement from performing in 2008 to concentrate on producing. Anderson later decided to become a full-time solo artist, releasing three solo albums before Suede reformed in 2010.

The band&#x27;s drummer, Makoto Sakamoto, died on 21 August 2018 from an unspecified illness, as confirmed by Bernard Butler on Twitter.

<text>A construction worker is a person employed in the physical construction of the built environment and its infrastructure. 
==Definitions==
By some definitions, construction workers may be engaged in manual labour as unskilled or semi-skilled workers. These workers begin by attending to general tasks such as digging, cleaning, and unloading equipment. As they gain more experience, they start to specialize in particular areas - for example, roofing, pipefitting, structural work, or carpentry. Over time, some opt to receive certification and undergo formal training to achieve qualifications and promotion. In other words, they may be skilled tradespeople, or they may be supervisory or managerial personnel.

United Kingdom safety legislation has defined construction workers as people &quot;who work for or under the control of a contractor on a construction site.&quot; In Canada, this can include people whose work includes ensuring conformance with building codes and regulations and those who supervise other workers.

=== Demographics ===
Most construction workers are primarily described by the specific level and type of work they perform. Laborers comprise a large grouping in most national construction industries. In the United States, for example, in May 2023, construction sector businesses employed just over 7.9 million people, of whom 859,000 were laborers, while 3.7 million were construction trades workers (including 603,000 carpenters, 559,000 electricians, 385,000 plumbers, and 321,000 equipment operators). Like most business sectors, there is also substantial white-collar employment in construction - out of 7.9 million US construction business workers, 681,000 were recorded by the United States Department of Labor in May 2023 as in &#x27;office and administrative support occupations&#x27;, 620,000 in &#x27;management occupations&#x27; and 480,000 in &#x27;business and financial operations occupations&#x27;.

In 2023, the United States reported that, of the total number of construction workers, 27.7% of workers were Hispanic and around 6.2% were women. In some economies, there is also substantial self-employment; in the United Kingdom for example, 1.4 million out of 2.25 million construction workers were classified as self-employed in 2023. In the US in 2015, unincorporated self-employment rates were highest for workers in construction and extraction occupations (14.8 percent).

Construction workers can colloquially be referred to as &quot;hard hat workers&quot; or &quot;hard hats&quot;, as they often wear hard hats for safety while working on construction sites.

== Safety ==

The construction industry is a high-hazard sector, encompassing alteration and repair. Workers are exposed to various serious hazards, such as falling debris, unguarded machinery, heavy equipment, electrocutions, silica dust, and asbestos. Thus, construction safety is intended to ensure a safe environment for workers, who are required to be educated on safety at each site. Construction workers must remain vigilant by keeping work areas clear, learning safe lifting techniques, being aware of seasonal hazards, and regularly inspecting all equipment, among other preventive measures.

All companies in the United States require workers to have an OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) certification to ensure safety on the worksite. In many cases, OSHA inspectors visit worksites to ensure that all safety protocols are in place to protect workers. Employers are also required by law to have an OSHA job safety poster.

In India, the Building and Other Construction Workers Act 1996 regulates the employment and conditions of service of building and other construction workers and provides for safety, health and welfare measures.

==Examples of poor pay and working conditions for migrant workers==
In 2008, a Human Rights Watch report described unsafe and unfair working conditions in China and a failure on the part of the government to enforce labor standards in the construction industry. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that, at the end of 2006, 90% of the 40 million construction workers in China were migrant workers. Many turned to work after their farming communities collapsed into poverty.

In the United States, illegal immigrant labor is prevalent in the industry. Due to workers&#x27; questionable legal status, some employers commit crimes such as wage theft and violation of workplace standards, running little risk of consequences. Similar abuse occurred in Qatar during preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup where workers, mostly from poor countries in the Indian subcontinent, worked in desert conditions for as little as €6.20 a day.

<doc id="1121462" wikidata="Q1818051" url="?curid=1121462" title="Lenni Brenner">
<text>Lenni Brenner (born 1937), formerly known as Leonard Glaser or Lenny Glaser, is an American Trotskyist writer. In the 1960s, Brenner was a prominent civil rights movement activist and vocal opponent of the Vietnam War. Since the 1980s, his activism has focused on anti-Zionism. He has published widely on the history of Zionism, in particular asserting that the movement collaborated with the Nazis.

==Early life==
Brenner was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in 1937. He says he developed an early interest in history from reading Hendrik Willem van Loon&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; at age seven, which his brother had received as a bar mitzvah present. He had no interest in Jewish issues until around 1973, since, Brenner has remarked, he hailed from a milieu that frequented the synagogue only until the bar mitzvah rite was completed.

==Political activity==
Brenner has recounted that his involvement with the Civil Rights Movement began when he met James Farmer of the Congress of Racial Equality, later the organizer of the Freedom Rides of the early 1960s. He also worked with Bayard Rustin, later the organizer of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Brenner was arrested three times during civil rights sit-ins in the San Francisco Bay Area, In an article in the San Francisco Examiner Brenner, together with Mike Myerson, was identified as a member of the W.E.B. Du Bois youth wing of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) within the &quot;Ad Hoc Committee to End Discrimination&quot; (AHCED).

===Berkeley 1964, arrest and imprisonment===
Brenner, then known as Glaser, came to Berkeley in 1962. A bid to enroll in the orthodox Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party was rejected though he was permitted to join its youth branch, from which he was expelled for ignoring an order that he desist from talking about drug reform at street rallies. In February 1964, he was arrested on a drug charge and put on probation for marijuana possession.

Though a non-student, Brenner at UC had become by this time a long-time campus orator, a familiar if solitary figure on the Berkeley campus (UC), where he delivered passionate tirades to passing students while protesting issues like Kennedy&#x27;s handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the papal opposition to birth control, while also advocating for the legalization of marijuana. On the missile crisis he once delivered a non-stop speech from noon to midnight at Bancroft and Telegraph Avenue in 1962. That venue was not thought to be on University property. The UC, under Chancellor Clark Kerr, who believed Communist influence lay behind the Free Speech Movement (FSM), had recently banned political activities on campus, and speakers were obliged to address passers-by outside, on city-owned property, though card-tables with leaflets were permitted a few steps inside. On September 14, 1964, the University administration extended its ban, in effect from the 21st., to these card tables on the 26 foot brick walkway, technically also University property, just outside the campus entrance. The tightening of this regulation triggered a wave of defiance, with students challenging the order by moving the card-tables inside the campus grounds.

On October 1, 1964, Jack Weinberg a student of mathematics who had graduated with great distinction, challenged the ruling by setting up one such card table in Sproul Plaza. He was collecting funds for Congress of Racial Equality(CORE): a number of campus activists at the time, including philosophy student Mario Savio, were spending their summers aiding the civil rights movement to get Afro-Americans to register for a vote in the face of Ku Klux Klan violence.

After Weinberg refused to identify himself to emissaries of the dean, a lieutenant from the campus police was called in and informed him of the infraction. Outnumbered, the policeman then left and came back with three more officers who arrested Weinberg for trespass and for violating the regulation against political activity. Weinberg, using a passive disobedience technique, went limp and had to be hauled to a police car, which was almost immediately encircled by hundreds of students. Brenner, In what has been described as an &quot;historic event,&quot; is generally reported to have been the first in the crowd to try and physically block the exit of the police vehicle detaining Weinberg by Weinberg by rolling under it. Several hundred joined him and the car remained &quot;entrapped&quot; for 32 hours. In response, 643 police were assembled on the campus by 2 October. The hood of the car was turned into a platform where Savio, and one source claims Brenner himself, made speeches and Joan Baez sang before a growing student crowd of thousands.

Brenner, though present, later stated he was opposed to the ensuing demonstration, and that he had approached the car and asked Weinberg if he wanted to get out. Weinberg replied negatively saying that his presence there was of symbolic value. The University authorities regarded Brenner as a trouble-maker. Some days after the incident, the University police contacted Brenner&#x27;s probation officer expressing concern that his exceptional rhetorical talents might induce &quot;mob action or violence&quot; on the campus. According to David Goines, Brenner was then arrested when a policemen observed him accepting a beer from a passer-by and charged him with drinking in public. This charge signified legally that he had violated the terms of his three year probation.

Lewis Feuer frequently referred to Brenner (Glaser) as the nihilistic Nechayev of the FSM, the evil genius behind the movement. The UC sent a representative to testify against Brenner&#x27;s probation while Brenner was denied the right to call witnesses on his own behalf. The court ruling revoked his probation on the grounds that he had obstructed police in the execution of their duties. He was sentenced to 1 to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment. Brenner&#x27;s appeal against his conviction was turned down by Judge Richard Sims who however, according to Brenner, wrote that he was troubled by Judge Dieden&#x27;s ruling. For Sims, Brenner was not a felon. If he were mentally ill, referral to an appropriate institution would have been proper. Were he a trespassing social malcontent, he should have been judged for a normal misdemeanour.

UC faculty scholar William Petersen wrote an extensive report on the incident which, on 17 May 1965, was read into a Senate inquiry into putative Communist influence on American universities into internal security laws. In it Petersen described Brenner as a convicted narcotics user who assaulted police. Brenner subsequently spent 39 months in jail at California Men&#x27;s Colony. In the Oakland lockup, while waiting to be sent to the state penitentiary, he met and had intense discussions with Huey Newton. He recalls that his time in prison enabled him to read widely in the library, enjoy free medical care, and engage with some of the &quot;most impressive &amp; intelligent people&quot; he encountered in the 60s decade.

Brenner was released on January 22, 1968, after serving a term of 3 years and 3 months. In a memoir of the period, one of the FSM leaders, Michael Rossman argued that the movement, in failing to stand by Brenner when he was targeted by the authorities, had effectively betrayed him and his distinctive campus voice.

==Latter activism==
Brenner joined in the Free Speech Movement when it emerged on campus in the mid-1960s. He was an anti-war activist during the Vietnam War. In 1968 he co-founded the &quot;National Association for Irish Justice&quot;, the American affiliate of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association.

In the 1990s, he and the Black Power leader Kwame Ture (aka Stokely Carmichael) co-founded a &quot;Committee against Zionism and Racism&quot;. They also published &quot;The Anti-War Activist&quot;. In the early 2000s, he also became active in endeavouring to organize a &quot;Coalition for Narcotic Law Reform&quot; in the US.

Brenner spoke at an Israeli Apartheid Week event in 2011 at Berlin, Connecticut.

==Writing==
His books have been widely translated and reviewed in 11 languages. His books have been reviewed in the London &quot;Times&quot;, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Booklist&quot; magazine, and the &quot;Washington Report on Middle East Affairs&quot;.

His articles have also appeared in publications related to the Middle East and identifying with the political left, including &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam News&quot;, &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;, &quot;Washington Report on Middle East Affairs&quot;, &quot;Middle East Policy&quot;, &quot;Journal of Palestine Studies&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;Al-Fajr&quot; and &quot;United Irishman&quot;.

The Institute for Historical Review, a Holocaust denial platform, has cited, promoted, and sold Brenner&#x27;s work. Brenner has opposed his work being used by those on the far right, and those engaged in Holocaust denial. Antisemitism scholar Kenneth S. Stern has described Brenner as antisemitic. Brenner says that since he is Jewish, rather than being called an &quot;anti-Semite&quot;, he is often called a &quot;self-hating Jew&quot;.

Anti-Zionist activist Uri Davis positively reviewed both &quot;Zionism in the Age of the Dictators&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Iron Wall&quot; (1984) for &quot;Race and Class&quot;. He said that both works contained invaluable information and documentation, but had uneven quality. In Davis&#x27;s view, the former book was an important &quot;work informed by the moral and the political insight of the author as an anti-Zionist scholar&quot;. Davis found the thrust of the latter study, despite its impeccable documentation, somewhat weakened by passages of &quot;pseudo-Freudian causal explanations&quot; that Brenner wrote to supplement his political analysis. Secondly Davis says that Brenner makes &quot;repeated irresponsible political statements verging on the nonsensensical&quot;, such as Brenner&#x27;s notion that, were it not for the presence of the British army, the tiny Zionist yishuv would have been driven into the sea.

In 2016, British socialist politician Ken Livingstone praised Brenner&#x27;s book &quot;Zionism in the Age of the Dictators&quot; while defending comments he made about Adolf Hitler which were widely considered antisemitic, helping to spark a controversy about Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party. Historian of Nazi Germany Michael Burleigh said that Brenner and Livingstone &quot;strain[ed] the objectively episodic and marginal into something maliciously significant&quot;.

==Bibliography==
Brenner has authored, co-authored and edited a number of books:

* &quot;Black Liberation and Palestine Solidarity&quot; (2013)– a collection of selected essays that &quot;discusses the historical response of African American freedom movements to the colonial settler state of Israel and its role in American Imperialism in the Middle East.&quot;

==Wider views==
* Brenner is said to have read legal works extensively during his incarceration, and to have become contemptuous of law generally and the Supreme Court in particular (making an exception of the Fourth Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. In his viewThe wind blows a piece of paper into the law courts and it takes a yoke of oxen to get it out.
* In protesting the ban on marijuana use, Brenner framed his case in terms of the United States Constitution. The personal use of marijuana was a widespread, &quot;trivial&quot; and customary habit and, he argued, therefore was protected by the unenumerated rights alluded to in the 9th Amendment, according to which, &quot;(t)he enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the People.&quot;

<text>The Shackleton Range () is a mountain range in Antarctica that rises to and extends in an east–west direction for about between the Slessor and Recovery Glaciers.

==Surveys==

The Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE), which in 1956 saw the range from the air, conducted a ground-level survey of its western part in 1957. The United States Navy photographed the range from the air in 1967. In 1968–69 and 1969–70, the British Antarctic Survey (based at Halley Station) conducted further ground surveys with support from US Navy C-130 Hercules aircraft.
The range was named after Sir Ernest Shackleton (1874–1922), leader of the British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (or &quot;Shackleton&#x27;s Expedition&quot;) of 1914–1916, the unsuccessful forerunner of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE).
Unofficial names include Cordillera Los Menucos, Cordon Los Menucos, Shackletonkjeda, Shackleton Mountains.

==Geology==

The range is at the northwestern edge of the East Antarctic Craton.
To the west of the Shackleton Range, the Transantarctic Mountains run from north to south.
These mountains formed around 500 million years ago during the Pan-African Ross Orogony along the former Pacific edge of the East Antarctic Craton.
The two ranges differ in structural trends, being almost at right angles to each, and in rock types.
It is commonly thought that the Shackleton Range was caused by an oblique collision between the East Antarctic and Kalahari cratons that closed the Mozambique Ocean.

The Haskard Group and Turnpike Bluff Group rest unconformably on the Archean-Middle Proterozoic Shackleton Range Metamorphic Complex. The Ordovician-Early Devonian Blaiklock Glacier Group (475 Ma) also unconformably overlies the Shackleton Range Metamorphic Complex. This group is composed of sandstones and conglomerates, and is unconformably overlain by the Beacon Supergroup.

==Tectonic history==
The range comprises three separate terranes with very different histories.
Analysis of geochronological data in these terranes implies that East Antarctica finally came together during the Pan-African orogeny, and its components were separate earlier in the Mesoproterozoic.

===Southern Terrane===

The southern belt, exposed in the Read Mountains, has medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks classified as the Read Group. They are mainly composed of partly migmatised quartzitic, basic, calcareous and pelitic rocks. In places they are interlayered with gneissic granites, and intruded by granites and basic rocks. 
Dating of the metagranites gives ages of around 1,760 and 1,600 million years.
Rb–Sr and K-Ar mineral cooling ages are 1650–1550 million years.

The Southern Terrane has detritus up to 2,850 million years old that experienced magmatism from 1,850 to 1,810 million years ago, a metamorphic event between 1,710 and 1,680 years ago, and another metamorphic event 510 million years ago.
Tectonics in the Southern Terrane during the Paleoproterozoic was very similar to that of the Mawson Continent, which may mean that this continent extends over the Eastern Antarctic Shield and includes the Shackleton Range.

===Eastern Terrane===
The Eastern Terrane holds granitoid rocks formed around 1,060 million years ago during the Grenville orogeny that experienced metamorphism around 600 million years ago.
The events at 1,060 and 600 million years ago are similar to the Grenvillian and Pan-African tectonics in Queen Maud Land, suggesting that the Shackleton Range holds part of the Pan African Mozambique/Maud Belt.
The suture located in the extreme east of the range was formed during the amalgamation of West Gondwana and the Indo-Antarctic plate.

===Northern Terrane===

The northern belt extends from the Pioneer Escarpment in the east to the northern Haskard Highlands in the west.
It has been divided into the Pioneers Group, the Stratton Group, and an ophiolite complex that may be a relic of the Mozambique Ocean.
The Northern Terrane has paragneisses, mafic and ultramafic rocks that host granites and diorites dating to 530 million years ago, which experienced metamorphism 510 to 500 million years ago.
This terrane holds the suture formed when the combined Indo-Antarctic/West Gondwanan block collided with East Gondwana about 510 million years ago.
The suture may also extend through the Sør Rondane Mountains and the Lützow-Holm Bay area to the north.

==Topology==

The Shackleton Range is long in an east-west direction and up to wide.
It stretches from the Filchner Ice Shelf eastward until it is fully covered at a height of about by the Antarctic ice sheet.
The range is an ice-covered plateau between high that rises between two large glaciers.
The plateau generally slopes down to the north, so most of the ice from the range flows via wide glaciers into the fast-moving Slessor Glacier, and much less flows south into the slower-moving Recovery Glacier. This probably explains why erosion is higher in the north of the range.

The Shackleton Range is a rectangular horst rising above major fault zones now under the Slessor and Recovery glaciers.
The center of the range is covered by a long ice cap extending from the Fuchs Dome in the west to Shotton Snowfield in the east, and bounded by cliffs as high as .
There are areas of rocky outcrop around the margins of the plateau.
The Read Mountains on the southeast edge of the range are the highest, at , while there are lower peaks at along the northern edge.
The connected valleys of the north-flowing Gordon Glacier and south-flowing Cornwall Glacier may reflect an underlying fault zone, and have been treated as a divide between the western and eastern portions of the Shackleton Range.
The plateau surface is a discontinuous and faulted undulating peneplain, most visible on the south of the range.
The flat areas free of ice at the edge of the Fuchs Dome and Shotton Snowfield and the table mountains that surround them are the remnants of the peneplain.
In the Read Mountains there are south-facing cirques as wide as surrounded by high cliffs.
The ridges between the cirques stretch over to the south, and in seven cases widen to form flat-topped buttes.
In the north and northwest the range is made up of small table mountains and isolated peaks.
There are fifteen table mountains in the south of the range, seven in the southwest and just three in the north.

==Glacial activity==

The geology and origin of glacial erratics, and the evidence of subglacial erosion in the Shackleton Range show that the whole range was once overrun by ice from the south or southeast.
The erratics were probably carried north from the Whichaway Nunataks and the Pensacola Mountains around the end of the Miocene during the last major expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet.
The ice was thicker than today, and the ice flowed north unaffected by the local landforms.
During the Last Glacial Period, the Filchner ice shelf expanded and blocked the Slessor Glacier, which deposited till and scattered erratics.

Today, the ice in most of the range still flows north into the Slessor Glacier.
However, ice from a small area in the southwest of the snowfield flows south between the Read Mountains and the Stephenson Bastion into the Recovery Glacier, and small glaciers carry ice south from the Read Mountains and Stephenson Bastion.

The high table mountains in the south, exposed to the prevailing winds, have been free of ice for longest and have experienced more weathering than the lower mountains to the north.
The Read Mountains have probably been ice-free since before the Quaternary.
With few exceptions the table top mountains are free of glacial deposits, although glacial striations and crescentic gouges show that they have been subject to glacial activity in the past.
The assumption is that during the long ice-free period the deposits have been eroded away.

==Topographical Features==

In the interior of the range the Fuchs Dome is in the west part, from which the Shotton Snowfield extends to the east.
The Otter Highlands are at the west end of the range between the Slessor and Recovery glaciers.
Extending eastward along the north (Slessor) side of the range are the Haskard Highlands, La Grange Nunataks, Herbert Mountains and Pioneers Escarpment.
From east to west along the south (Recovery) side of the range are the Read Mountains and Stephenson Bastion.

===Fuchs Dome===
Fuchs Dome () is a large ice-covered dome rising over , between Stratton Glacier and Gordon Glacier in the central part of the Shackleton Range, Antarctica. It was first mapped in 1957 by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE) and named for Sir Vivian E. Fuchs, leader of the CTAE 1955–58.

===Shotton Snowfield===
A large snowfield between Herbert Mountains and Pioneers Escarpment on the north and Read Mountains on the south, in the Shackleton Range. 
The U.S. Navy obtained aerial photographs of the feature in 1967 and it was surveyed by BAS, 1968-71. 
Named by the UK-APC, 1971, in association with the names of glacial geologists grouped in this area, after Frederick W. Shotton (1906-90), British Quaternary geologist and Professor of Geology, University of Birmingham, 1949-74. Not: Shottonfonna.

===Otter Highlands===

Otter Highlands () is a group of peaks and ridges extending northwest-southeast for from Mount Lowe to Wyeth Heights, located west of Blaiklock Glacier and forming the west end of the Shackleton Range. Surveyed by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1957. Named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1972 after the De Havilland Otter aircraft which supported the CTAE.

===Haskard Highlands===

The Haskard Highlands () are a range of peaks and ridges between Blaiklock Glacier and Stratton Glacier in the northwest of the Shackleton Range, Antarctica, rising to at Mount Weston and including features between Mount Provender and Pointer Nunatak. The highlands were first mapped in 1957 by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, and photographed from the air by the U.S. Navy in 1967. They were surveyed by the British Antarctic Survey between 1968 and 1971, and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1971 after Sir Cosmo Haskard, Governor of the Falkland Islands 1964–70.

===La Grange Nunataks===

La Grange Nunataks () is a scattered group of nunataks extending west for from the mouth of Gordon Glacier, on the north side of the Shackleton Range, Antarctica. They were first mapped in 1957 by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE), and were photographed in 1967 by U.S. Navy aircraft. They were named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee for Johannes J. La Grange, a South African meteorologist with the CTAE. Not: Beney Nunataks.

===Herbert Mountains===
The Herbert Mountains () are a conspicuous group of rock summits on the east side of Gordon Glacier in the Shackleton Range of Antarctica. They were first mapped in 1957 by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition and named for Sir Edwin S. Herbert, Chairman of the Finance Committee and a Member of the Committee of Management of the expedition, 1955–58.

===Pioneers Escarpment===

Pioneers Escarpment () is a mostly snow-covered north-facing escarpment, interrupted by occasional bluffs and spurs, between Slessor Glacier on the north and Shotton Snowfield on the south, in the Shackleton Range. The escarpment was photographed from the air by the U.S. Navy, 1967, and was surveyed by British Antarctic Survey (BAS), 1968–71. So named by United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) because features on the escarpment are named after the pioneers whose inventions have assisted living and traveling conditions in the polar regions.

===Read Mountains===
Read Mountains&#x27; is a group of rocky summits, the highest Holmes Summit , lying east of Glen Glacier in the south-central part of the Shackleton Range. First mapped in 1957 by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition and named for Professor Herbert H. Read, Chairman of the Scientific Committee and member of the Committee of Management of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–58.

===Stephenson Bastion===

Stephenson Bastion () is a mountain massif with steep rock cliffs on its south side, rising to in the south-central part of the Shackleton Range. It was first mapped in 1957 by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, and it was photographed by U.S. Navy aircraft in 1967. It was named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) for Philip J. Stephenson, an Australian geologist with the transpolar party of the CTAE in 1956–58.

==Glaciers==

The range lies between the Slessor Glacier to the north and the Recovery Glacier to the south, both of which flow west into the Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf.
Slessor Glacier is about wide and drops from an elevation of over at the eastern end of the range to about at the western end where it enters the Filchner ice shelf.
This results in rapid flow, with areas of chaotic ice and many crevasses.
The Recovery Glacier is about wide, and drops from about along the range.
With a lower gradient it flows more slowly and has fewer crevasses.
The Schimper Glacier, Gordon Glacier, Stratton Glacier and Blaiklock Glacier flow northwest from the range into the Slessor Glacier.
The Glen Glacier and Cornwall Glacier flow south into the Recovery Glacier.

===Recovery Glacier===
. 
Glacier, at least long and wide at its mouth, flowing west along the south side of the Shackleton Range. 
First seen from the air and examined from the ground by the CTAF in 1957, and so named because of the recovery of the expedition&#x27;s vehicles which repeatedly broke into bridged crevasses on this glacier during the early stages of the crossing of Antarctica. Not: Glaciar Expedicion Polar Argentina, Glaciar Falucho.

===Slessor Glacier===
Glacier at least long and wide, flowing west into the Filchner Ice Shelf to the north of the Shackleton Range. 
First seen from the air and mapped by the CTAE in 1956. 
Named by the CTAE for Marshal of the RAF Sir John Slessor, chairman of the expedition committee.

===Glen Glacier===
Glacier () at least long, flowing south in the Shackleton Range to join Recovery Glacier to the west of Read Mountains. First mapped in 1957 by the CTAE and named for Alexander R. Glen, member of the Committee of Management of the CTAE, 1955–58.

===Cornwall Glacier===
Glacier long, flowing south from Crossover Pass in the Shackleton Range to join Recovery Glacier east of Ram Bow Bluff.
First mapped in 1957 by the CTAE and named for Gen. Sir James H. Marshall-Cornwall, member of the Committee of Management of the CTAE, 1955-58.

===Schimper Glacier===
A glacier in the east part of Herbert Mountains, Shackleton Range, flowing north-northeast into Slessor Glacier. 
Photographed from the air by the U.S. Navy, 1967, and surveyed by BAS, 1968-71. 
In association with the names of glacial geologists grouped in the area, named by the UK-APC after Karl Friedrich Schimper (1803–67), German botanist who in 1835 originated the theory of
the Ice Age in Europe to account for the distribution of erratic boulders.

===Gordon Glacier===
Glacier at least long, flowing north from Crossover Pass through the Shackleton Range to join Slessor Glacier. 
First mapped in 1957 by the CTAE and named after George P. Pirie-Gordon, member of the Committee of Management and treasurer of the CTAE, 1955-58.

===Stratton Glacier===
A glacier long, flowing north from Pointer Nunatak and then northwest to the north of Mount Weston, in the Shackleton Range. 
First mapped in 1957 by the CTAE and named for David G. Stratton, surveyor and deputy leader of the transpolar party of the CTAE in 1956-58.

===Blaiklock Glacier===
Glacier long, flowing north from Turnpike Bluff, then northwest to Mounts Provender and Lowe in the west part of the Shackleton Range. 
First mapped in 1957 by the CTAE and named for Kenneth V. Blaiklock, leader of the advance party of the CTAE in 1955-56 and surveyor with the transpolar party in 1956-58.

==Other features==

===Crossover Pass===
Pass between Gordon and Cornwall Glaciers in the central part of the Shackleton Range. 
First mapped in 1957 by the CTAE and so named because this pass, together with Gordon and Cornwall Glaciers, provides a sledging route across the Shackleton Range from north to south.

===Warden Pass===
A snow pass at c. trending east-west between the northwest side of Fuchs Dome and Flat Top in the Shackleton Range. 
The area was surveyed by CTAE in 1957. 
Named by the UK-APC after Michael A. Warden, BAS general assistant, Halley Station, 1970-72, who worked in the area.

===Nostoc Lake===
Lake lying southwest of Mount Provender in the west part of the Shackleton Range. 
First mapped in 1957 by the CTAE and given the generic name of the freshwater alga found growing in the lake.

<doc id="1121484" wikidata="Q23540923" url="?curid=1121484" title="List of heads of government of Ethiopia">
<text>This is a list of heads of government of Ethiopia since the formation of the post of Chief Minister of the Ethiopian Empire in 1909 (renamed to Prime Minister in 1943). Since 1909, there have been 3 chief ministers and 11 prime ministers and one was both chief minister and prime minister, making a total of 15 persons being or having been &quot;head of government&quot;.

Most of the prime ministers of Ethiopia were regular prime ministers, appointed through a regular political process. Some others were acting prime ministers only (indicated in the list below), while others were both acting and regular prime ministers during their term(s). In addition, there is one prime minister who was acting prime minister first, then was regularly appointed and finally served as a caretaker prime minister of an outgoing government: Hailemariam Desalegn. During the 1960 coup d&#x27;état attempt, two prime ministers served at the same time, the regular one and an irregular one appointed by the leaders of the coup. Also, there was an interim prime minister after the end of the Ethiopian Civil War.

Since 1995, the prime minister of Ethiopia has not only been the head of government, but also the commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian National Defense Force. The current prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, took office on 2 April 2018.

As an unincorporated community, Pittsford lacks legal autonomy but does have its own post office, which serves the 49271 ZIP Code.

==History==
The area was first settled in 1833 when Hiram Kidler moved to the region. Originally known as Locust Corners, the community was renamed Pittsford by Alpheus Pratt, who had moved from Pittsford, New York. A post office under the name Pittsford opened on September 19, 1840. Although the post office was temporarily closed from September 12 to December 3, 1845, it was later relocated to the western part of Pittsford Township and renamed Sparta on January 4, 1846. In turn, the nearby Keene post office was transferred and renamed Pittsford on January 30, 1846. The community later became home to a station along the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway.

In the 2020 census, Cambria was newly listed as a census-designated place, included for statistical purposes only. Like Pittsford, Cambria remains an unincorporated community with no legal autonomy.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The community is served by Pittsford Area Schools, which also serves portions of several adjacent townships.

<text>Osseo ( ) is an unincorporated community in Hillsdale County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located along M-34 within Jefferson Township.

As an unincorporated community, Osseo has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 49266 ZIP Code.

==Geography==

Osseo is located in southeast Michigan in central Hillsdale County about east of the city of Coldwater. Located in northern Jefferson Township, the community sits at an elevation of above sea level.

Osseo is centered near M-34 (Hudson Road), which is right before M-34 has its western terminus with M-99 (Pioneer Road). Other nearby unincorporated communities include Steamburg to the west, Shadyside and Fountain Park to the south, Locust Corners to the east, and the census-designated place of Pittsford to the southeast. The city of Hillsdale is located about to the northwest along M-99.

The commununity is surrounded by several lakes, including Deer Lake and Twin Lake within close proximity. The lakes are connected by the east branch of the St. Joseph River. The Lost Nations State Game Area is a state game area located just south of the community. The North Country Trail passes though Osseo. This portion of the trail is known as the Baw Beese Trail, which runs northwest to Hillsdale.

The Jefferson Township Hall is located within Osseo at 2837 Bird Lake Road in the center of the community. The Osseo post office is located at 5500 Beecher Road. The Osseo 49266 ZIP Code serves the majority of Jefferson Township and the southern portion of Adams Township to the north. The post office also serves a very small area of Wheatland Township to the east, as well as the central part of Ransom Township and very small areas of Amboy Township and Cambria Township to the south. The community is served by Hillsdale Community Schools to the northwest in the city of Hillsdale.

==History==
The area was first settled as early as 1840 when the community of Osseo was officially platted. The name Osseo is an Indian word that means &quot;fiery plumes&quot; and was derived from the annual burning of the marshes and woods by the Indians in preparation for springtime.

The community was formed by settlers from nearby Jonesville is an attempt to keep the county seat from moving to Hillsdale. Jonesville was previously assigned as the first county seat when Hillsdale County was organized in 1835, but the community of Hillsdale was growing in size and was petitioning to replace Jonesville as the county seat. Instead, the new community of Osseo was given the role as the new county seat in 1840, although the community never held any government offices and was never actually used as the county seat. While Osseo was designated as the legal county seat, Jonesville and Hillsdale continued competing for the right to serve as the county seat in a fairly nonviolent county seat war.

Residents of Osseo began planning and were eager to build new government buildings in hopes of maintaining their status as the county seat. However, Osseo was never seriously considered as the new county seat, and it was just a plan by Jonesville residents to keep the county seat away from Hillsdale. Ultimately, when it was apparent that Osseo was going to lose its status as the county seat, the residents sided with Hillsdale for the role of the permanent county seat, in which Hillsdale earned in 1843.

When Osseo was founded, it was part of Florida Township. A post office named Florida began operating on July 23, 1839 within the township, which itself was established in 1837. The township was renamed Jefferson in 1849. The community can be seen on an 1857 map of Hillsdale County. The Florida post office was moved and renamed Osseo on December 14, 1861 and has remained in operation ever since. In 1864, Osseo received a train station along the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. Osseo became a lumbering community, and several sawmills were built to exploit the area&#x27;s lumber resources. By 1865, the community recorded around 250 residents. By 1879 at the height of the community, Osseo had a population of around 350 residents and grew to include about 60 dwellings, two churches, several grocery and hardware stores, blacksmith shops, two factories, a hotel, and schoolhouse. In addition to lumber, the community grew around the brick and tile factories, which benefited from the large amount of clay soil in the area.

In 1919, M-34 became one of the first state highways and ran though Osseo. This highway gave direct road access to the city of Adrian approximately to the east. In 1940, the current route of M-99 was established slightly west of the community, and it provides direct road access to Hillsdale and Jonesville to the northwest and to the state of Ohio to the south. The railway through the community was eventually discontinued, and the rail lines were removed. The land of the former railway has remained undeveloped as a green space, and portions of this now consist of the Baw Beese Trail as part of the North Country Trail.

<text>Paulo César Wanchope Watson (; born 31 July 1976), more commonly known as Paulo Wanchope, is a Costa Rican football coach and former professional footballer 

As a player he was a striker who notably played in the Premier League for Derby County, West Ham United and Manchester City. He also had spells in La Liga and Major League Soccer for Málaga and Chicago Fire as well as Herediano, Al-Gharafa, Rosario Central and FC Tokyo. He was capped 73 times by Costa Rica, scoring 45 goals. Wanchope is the second most prolific goalscorer in the history of the Costa Rica national football team, behind Rolando Fonseca, with 45 goals in 73 international matches. Having scored against Brazil in 2002 and a brace against Germany in 2006, Wanchope is the top goalscorer for Costa Rica in the FIFA World Cup, a record he shares with Rónald Gómez.

As he is the former head coach of the Costa Rica national football team with a spell in charge between 2014 and 2015. He has also managed Herediano, Uruguay Coronado, CS Cartaginés and Pérez Zeledón.

==Club career==

===Derby County===
Born in Heredia, Wanchope began his career with CS Herediano moving to England to play with Derby County along with fellow Costa Rican Mauricio Solís on 27 March 1997. He cost Derby £600,000.

Wanchope marked his debut for Derby on 5 April 1997 with a memorable goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford, beating four United players before slotting past Peter Schmeichel during a 3–2 win – the goal was later voted the greatest in the club&#x27;s history by the Derby fans as part of the club&#x27;s 125th Anniversary Celebrations.

He scored 13 league goals in 1997–98 as Derby finished ninth – their highest finish since 1989 – and helped them go one better in 1998–99 when his nine goals that season helped the Rams finish eighth.

After scoring 28 goals in 83 games within two seasons for Derby, Wanchope was sold to West Ham United for £3.5 million on 16 July 1999.

===West Ham United===
Wanchope made his debut for West Ham on 28 July 1999, at Upton Park, against Heerenveen in the Intertoto Cup. His first West Ham goal came on 4 August 1999 in the away leg of the same tie. He scored 15 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions; his final game coming on 14 May 2000, at home to Leeds United. During his one year at Upton Park Wanchope formed a deadly partnership with Paolo Di Canio, the two scored a combined 31 league goals in the 1999–2000 season, and West Ham finished 9th in the Premier League, putting them in the top nine for the third consecutive season.
He was eventually sold to Manchester City at the start of the 2000–01 season, following the arrivals of Davor Šuker and Frédéric Kanouté, for a fee of £3.65million.

===Manchester City===
On 23 August 2000 he scored a hat-trick in a 4–2 win against Sunderland.
Wanchope earned a starting position at Manchester City, but was unable to help them avoid immediate relegation back to Division One at the end of the 2000–01 season, despite scoring nine league goals.

The following season was a mixed one for Wanchope. Despite missing large chunks of it through injury, he still managed 12 goals in just 15 games and often showed his best form. After City&#x27;s return to the top flight as Division One champions he played almost no part, with injury once again keeping him on the sidelines – he missed the entire 2002–03 season.

However, he returned to play a vital part at the end of 2003–04 and scored some vital goals to help avoid relegation, including the winning goal against Newcastle United, which effectively made City safe. He managed six goals from 22 league games that campaign.
===Post-Premier League===

In August 2004, Wanchope was sold to Málaga CF of the Spanish La Liga for £500,000. He played 25 games for the club, scoring six goals.

In 2005, &quot;ESPN&quot; declared Wanchope&#x27;s goal against Numancia the best of the entire 2004–05 Spanish First Division. In 2006, following the World Cup in Germany and short but successful stints with Al-Gharafa in Qatar and Herediano in his native Costa Rica, he signed with Argentine club Rosario Central, scoring five goals in 14 games.

On 29 December 2006, J1 League club FC Tokyo announced the acquisition of Wanchope on a transfer from Rosario Central. Along with local prospect Sota Hirayama, Wanchope allowed FC Tokyo to utilise a pair of large (190 cm+) strikers. He was released by FC Tokyo and subsequently signed a one-year deal with MLS team Chicago Fire.

===Retirement===
On 16 November 2007, after a 13-year career in football, Wanchope decided to put an end to his career, primarily based on how his old knee injury was affecting his performance on the field, the same injury that made him lose large parts of his career with Manchester City, making him unable to reach his best physical shape, an argument that was commonly criticized by the press during recent years in every club he played for. At his retirement press conference he manifested his interest in becoming a professional coach, looking forward to accomplishing it in England.

==International career==
He was a member of Costa Rica&#x27;s youth national teams, playing in the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship finals in Qatar.

Wanchope would become hugely important to the senior Costa Rica national team, after making his debut in an October 1996 friendly match against Venezuela and playing for the team in the 2002 FIFA World Cup and several Gold Cups. On 8 October 2005, Wanchope became the all-time leading goal scorer for &quot;Los Ticos&quot; when he scored the first goal in a home win over the USA in the qualifying match that sent &quot;Los Ticos&quot; to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Wanchope has twenty plus World Cup qualifier goals to his name.

On 9 June 2006, he scored twice in the opening game of the 2006 World Cup, a 4–2 loss to Germany. These two goals made Wanchope the inaugural Costa Rican to score twice in one World Cup match, and put him alongside Rónald Gómez as the sole Costa Ricans ever to score more than one World Cup goal. After the defeat to Germany, Costa Rica were defeated by both Ecuador and Poland. Thus Costa Rica finished last in their group and failed to qualify for the second round. Wanchope played his last game for his country in January 2008 against Sweden. He played 25 minutes before being substituted.

==Managerial career==
He managed Club Sport Herediano from 2008 to 2009. He resigned citing that the team&#x27;s performance was low, and that he wanted to further his studies in England. Having left Herediano, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the administration of the club.

Wanchope became an assistant to the Costa Rica national team coach, Jorge Luis Pinto. Upon Pinto&#x27;s departure after the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Wanchope took over as interim national team coach.

In September 2014, he won the Copa Centroamericana with the Costa Rica national football team. On 31 January 2015, he was officially named as national team coach.

On 12 August 2015, Wanchope resigned as manager of Costa Rica&#x27;s national team following a post-match brawl with a steward.

==Personal life==
Wanchope is a son of Costa Rican former international striker Vicente Wanchope and Patricia Watson and both his brothers, Javier and Carlos, also played for the national team. He is married to Brenda Carballo and they have a son and daughter. He is of Jamaican descent.

<doc id="1121504" wikidata="Q751878" url="?curid=1121504" title="Manueline">
<text>The Manueline (, ), occasionally known as Portuguese late Gothic, is the sumptuous, composite Portuguese architectural style originating in the 16th century, during the Portuguese Renaissance and Age of Discoveries. Manueline architecture incorporates maritime elements and representations of the discoveries brought from the voyages of Vasco da Gama and Pedro Álvares Cabral. This innovative style synthesizes aspects of Late Gothic Flamboyant architecture with original motifs and influences of the Plateresque, Mudéjar, Italian, and Flemish architecture. It marks the transition from Late Gothic to Renaissance. The construction of churches and monasteries in Manueline was largely financed by proceeds of the lucrative spice trade with Africa and India.

The style was given its name, many years later, by Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Viscount of Porto Seguro, in his 1842 book &quot;Noticia historica e descriptiva do Mosteiro de Belem, com um glossario de varios termos respectivos principalmente a architectura gothica&quot;, in his description of the Jerónimos Monastery. Varnhagen named the style after King Manuel I, whose reign (1495–1521) coincided with its development. The style was much influenced by the astonishing successes of the voyages of discovery of Portuguese navigators, from the coastal areas of Africa to the discovery of Brazil and the ocean routes to the Far East.

Although the period of this style did not last long (from 1490 to 1520), it played an important part in the development of Portuguese art. The influence of the style outlived the king. Celebrating the newly maritime power, it manifested itself in architecture (churches, monasteries, palaces, castles) and extended into other arts such as sculpture, painting, works of art made of precious metals, faience and furniture.

==Characteristics==

This decorative style is characterized by virtuoso complex ornamentation in portals, windows, columns and arcades. In its end period, it tended to become excessively exuberant as in Tomar.

Several elements appear regularly in these intricately carved stoneworks:
* elements used on ships: the armillary sphere (a navigational instrument and the personal emblem of Manuel I and also a symbol of the cosmos), spheres, anchors, anchor chains, ropes and cables.
* elements from the sea, such as shells, pearls and strings of seaweed.
* botanical motifs such as laurel branches, oak leaves, acorns, poppy capsules, corncobs, and thistles.
* symbols of Christianity such as the cross of the Order of Christ (former Knights Templar), the military order that played a prominent role and helped finance the first voyages of discovery. The cross of this order decorated the sails of the Portuguese ships.
* elements from newly discovered lands (such as the tracery in the Royal Cloister of the Batalha Monastery, suggesting Islamic filigree work, influenced by buildings in India)
* columns carved like twisted strands of rope
* semicircular arches (instead of Gothic pointed arches) of doors and windows, sometimes consisting of three or more convex curves
* multiple pillars
* eight-sided capitals
* lack of symmetry
* conical pinnacles
* bevelled crenellations
* ornate portals with niches or canopies.

==Examples==

When King Manuel I died in 1521, he funded 62 construction projects. However, much original Manueline architecture in Portugal was lost or damaged beyond restoration in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and subsequent tsunami. In Lisbon, the Ribeira Palace, the residence of King Manuel I, and the Hospital Real de Todos os Santos were destroyed, along with several churches. The city, however, still has outstanding examples of the style in the Jerónimos Monastery (mainly designed by Diogo Boitac and João de Castilho) and in the small fortress of the Belém Tower (designed by Francisco de Arruda). Both are located close to each other in the Belém neighbourhood. The portal of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Velha, in downtown Lisbon, has also survived destruction.
Outside Lisbon, the church and chapter house of the Convent of Christ at Tomar (designed by Diogo de Arruda) is a major Manueline monument. In particular, the large window of the chapter house, with its fantastic sculptured organic and twisted rope forms, is one of the most extraordinary achievements of the Manueline style.

Other major Manueline monuments include the arcade screens of the Royal Cloister (designed by Diogo Boitac) and the Unfinished Chapels (designed by Mateus Fernandes) at the Monastery of Batalha and the Royal Palace of Sintra.

Other remarkable Manueline buildings include the church of the Monastery of Jesus of Setúbal (one of the earliest Manueline churches, also designed by Diogo Boitac), the Santa Cruz Monastery in Coimbra, the main churches in Golegã, Vila do Conde, Moura, Caminha, Olivença and portions of the cathedrals of Braga (main chapel), Viseu (rib vaulting of the nave) and Guarda (main portal, pillars, vaulting). Civil buildings in Manueline style exist in Évora (home to the Évora Royal Palace of 1525, by Pedro de Trillo, Diogo de Arruda and Francisco de Arruda) and the Castle of Évoramonte of 1531), Viana do Castelo, Guimarães and some other towns.

The style was extended to the decorative arts and spread throughout the Portuguese Empire, to the islands of the Azores, Madeira, enclaves in North Africa, Brazil, Goa in Portuguese India and even Macau, China. Its influence is apparent in southern Spain, the Canary Islands, North Africa and the former Spanish colonies of Peru and Mexico.

<doc id="1121512" wikidata="Q705374" url="?curid=1121512" title="Art Arfons">
<text>Arthur Eugene Arfons (February 3, 1926 – December 3, 2007) was the world land speed record holder three times from 1964 to 1965 with his &quot;Green Monster&quot; series of jet-powered cars, after a series of &quot;Green Monster&quot; piston-engine and jet-engined dragsters. He subsequently went on to field a succession of &quot;Green Monster&quot; turbine-engined pulling tractors, before returning to land speed record racing. He was announced as a 2008 inductee in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame three days after his death.

==Family==
Art Arfons&#x27; father, Tom, was born in Greece and came to the United States at age 14. He settled in Akron, Ohio, where Art was born. Tom died in 1950, at age 52. His mother, Bessie, who was of Cherokee descent, and died in 1983 at age 84. Arfons had two half brothers by his mother — Walt Arfons, ten years older, who was to become his partner and later competitor in motor sports, and Dale, eight years older, as well as one sister &quot;Lou&quot;, eighteen months older.

== Early life ==
Arfons&#x27; family operated a feed mill in rural Ohio, where the Arfons brothers exercised their mechanical skills and ingenuity. After his junior year of high school, at just under 17 years of age, Art joined the United States Navy. He was sent to diesel mechanic school, then assigned as a mechanic to a landing craft in the Pacific Theater. This was a very good job for Arfons to utilize his mechanical talents. He participated in two battles including the invasion of Okinawa, and then was discharged after three years, as a Petty Officer Second Class. He returned to Ohio, was married, and had two sons and a daughter. In 1952, he and his half-brother Walt became fascinated with drag racing and built their first Green Monster. In this endeavor, they were supported by their mother, who was also fascinated by the sport. Art and Walt continued their drag racing partnership with a series of &quot;Green Monster&quot; cars until the late 1950s, parting amicably but competing against each other.

== Land speed record ==
Arfons&#x27; path led almost inevitably to land speed record racing at Bonneville, first in 1960 with the &quot;Anteater&quot;, a car modeled after John Cobb&#x27;s &quot;Railton Special&quot; and powered by an Allison V-1710 aircraft engine. In 1961 he reached a top speed of before burning out the clutch. Arfons sold the car to Bob Motz.

In 1962, Arfons began experimenting with jet-powered cars, where his innate mechanical skills proved tremendously useful. Art&#x27;s first car, the 8,000 hp (6 MW) &quot;Cyclops&quot;, remains the fastest open cockpit vehicle, recording 330.113 miles per hour (531.265 km/h) in the measured mile in 1962. Unfortunately, his design had the driver sitting directly in the air intake to the engine, so that there was no way to enclose the cockpit and still supply air to the engine; this limited top speed severely. In deference to the car&#x27;s less-than-excellent aerodynamics, Arfons introduced another innovation: It was the first land speed record car to utilize a wing to produce downforce to prevent the car from becoming airborne.
Arfons returned to Bonneville in 1964 with another &quot;Green Monster&quot;. He held the world land speed record three times during the closely fought competition of 1964 and 1965, but after a bad crash in 1966 at 610 MPH, the fastest crash ever survived, turned his attention to jet turbine powered tractor pulling competition where he was, as usual, successful. In 1979 he won his only NTPA championship in the 9200 Modified class. In 1989, however, he attempted to return to land speed record competition, but was never competitive.

Art&#x27;s son, Tim Arfons, has continued the tradition by competing in jet-powered dragsters as well as in turbine-powered pulling &quot;funny cars&quot;, and has been a stunt and exhibition driver in a series of jet-powered ATVs and even a jet-powered personal watercraft. His daughter Allison &quot;Dusty&quot; Arfons, named after the aircraft engine in the Anteater, also competed in tractor pulling with her father. His oldest son Ronald Arthur Arfons, died on October 23, 2006, at age 58.

==Tragedy==
On October 16, 1971, while making an exhibition run at the Dallas International Motor Speedway in Lewisville, Texas, Arfons lost control of his radical jet-powered vehicle, resulting in the death of three people. IHRA staff members Robert John Kelsey (age 20) and Sean Pence (age 17) were struck and killed, along with WFAA (Dallas, Texas) news reporter, Gene Thomas (age 31), who was a passenger in the vehicle. Arfons&#x27; &quot;Super Cyclops&quot; was making its first run of the day in an attempt to pass the mark. Near the end of the run, a tire burst as the parachutes deployed; it veered into a guard rail and crashed beyond the finish line. Thomas, a popular Dallas television reporter, was apparently thrown out of the vehicle when it rolled over. The vehicle was configured with the driver and passenger sitting on each side of a huge engine. Arfons sustained minor injuries. He was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas and released shortly afterward. The Dallas event was to be his last race.

== Award ==
He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America and the International Drag Racing Hall of Fame (prior to 2005) &quot;Hall of Fame Inductees&quot;, International Motorsports Hall of Fame, National Tractor Puller Association Hall of Fame, and the Summit County Sports Hall of Fame. He is a three time World Land Speed record holder. He held the Unlimited Drag Racing Record and was a champion Tractor Puller.
*He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1991.

== Death and interment ==
Arfons died on December 3, 2007, in Springfield Township, Ohio, at the age of 81. He was interred at Mt. Peace Cemetery.

<doc id="1121515" wikidata="Q2026528" url="?curid=1121515" title="Rangda">
<text>Rangda () is the demon queen of the Leyaks in Bali, according to traditional Balinese mythology. Terrifying to behold, the child-eating Rangda leads an army of evil witches against the leader of the forces of good — Barong. The battle between Barong and Rangda is featured in a Barong dance which represents the eternal battle between good and evil.

Rangda is a term in old Javanese that means &quot;widow&quot;.

==Description==

Rangda is important in Balinese culture, and performances depicting her struggles with Barong or with Airlangga are popular tourist attractions as well as traditions. She is depicted as a mostly nude old woman, with long and unkempt hair, pendulous breasts, and claws. Her face is traditionally a horrifying fanged and goggle-eyed mask, with a long, protruding tongue.

==History==
Bali is a Hindu island, and it is suggested that Rangda may also be closely associated with Durga. She is also considered similar to the Hindu warrior goddess Kali, the goddess of destruction, transformation, and protection in Hinduism.

While Rangda is similar to Durga (or Kali) in some cases, she is mostly considered by many as the personification of evil, unlike 
Durga who is seen as a benevolent mother goddess of fertility and destruction in Northeastern India, particularly in Assam and Tripura.

Rangda was linked to the legend of Calon Arang and also the legend of the divorced and exiled Javanese queen Mahendradatta. The name Rangda in old Javanese and Balinese language means &quot;widow&quot;.

===Calon Arang===
Rangda is known as a Leyak queen, the incarnation of Calon Arang, the legendary witch that wreaked havoc in ancient Java during the reign of Airlangga in the late 10th century. It is said that Calon Arang was a widow, who had mastered the art of black magic, who often damaged farmers&#x27; crops and caused disease to come. She had a daughter, named Ratna Manggali, who, though beautiful, could not get a husband because people were afraid of her mother. Because of the difficulties faced by her daughter, Calon Arang was angry and she intended to take revenge by kidnapping a young girl. She brought the girl to a temple of Death to be sacrificed to the goddess Durga. The next day, a great flood engulfed the village and many people died. Disease also appeared.

King Airlangga, who had heard of this matter, then asked for his advisor, Empu Bharada, to deal with this problem. Empu Bharada then sent his disciple, Empu Bahula, to be married to Ratna. Both were married with a huge feast that lasted seven days and seven nights, and the situation returned to normal. Calon Arang had a book that contained magic incantations. One day, this book was found by Empu Bahula, who turned it over to Empu Bharada. As soon as Calon Arang knew that the book had been stolen, she became angry and decided to fight Empu Bharada. Without the help of Durga, Calon Arang was defeated. Since she was defeated, the village was safe from the threat of Calon Arang&#x27;s black magic.

Other interpretations claim that Rangda was derived from the historical 11th-century queen Mahendradatta or Gunapriyadharmapatni, a Javanese princess sister of Dharmawangsa of the East Javanese Ishana dynasty of late Mataram Kingdom period. She was the wife of Balinese king Udayana and Airlangga&#x27;s mother. Mahendradatta is known for her devotion to the cult of Durga in Bali.

The story goes that Mahendradatta, the mother of Airlangga, was condemned and exiled by the king, Udayana, for allegedly practicing witchcraft and black magic. After she became a widow, hurt and humiliated, she sought revenge upon her ex-husband&#x27;s court and the whole of his kingdom. She summoned all the evil spirits in the jungle, the Leyaks, and the demons that caused plague and death in the kingdom. She proceeded to take her revenge by killing off half the kingdom, which by then belonged to her and Dharmodayana&#x27;s son Airlangga, with a plague before being overcome by a holy man.

<doc id="1121516" wikidata="Q15242351" url="?curid=1121516" title="Recovery Glacier">
<text>The Recovery Glacier () is a glacier, at least long and wide at its mouth, flowing west along the southern side of the Shackleton Range in Antarctica.
==Discovery and name==
The Recovery Glacier was first seen from the air and examined from the ground by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1957.
It was so named because of the recovery of the expedition&#x27;s vehicles which repeatedly broke into bridged crevasses on this glacier during the early stages of the crossing of Antarctica.

==Glaciology==
Dana Floricioiu and Irena Hajnsek of the German Aerospace Centre spoke on the radar data showing the interior of the Recovery Glacier at the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium in Cape Town, South Africa, in July 2009. The data comes from the German public-private satellite Terrasar-X and when combined with Radarsat-1 shows the changes in the glacier over 11 years.

==Features==
===Recovery Ice Stream===
This ice stream drains part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet into the glacier. It is nearly long and feeds the Filchner Ice Shelf over the Weddell Sea. 
The area contains four subglacial lakes.
This causes the ice flow rate to vary dramatically, ranging between 2 and 50 meters per year. 
The ice stream drains about 35 billion tons of water and ice into the ocean each year. 
The entire East Antarctic ice sheet releases about 57 billion tons a year.

===Glen Glacier===
A glacier at least long, flowing south in the Shackleton Range to join the Recovery Glacier to the west of the Read Mountains. 
First mapped in 1957 by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE) and named for Alexander R. Glen, member of the Committee of Management of the CTAE, 1955-58.

===Cornwall Glacier===
A glacier long, flowing south from Crossover Pass in the Shackleton Range to join Recovery Glacier east of Ram Bow Bluff.
First mapped in 1957 by the CTAE and named for Gen. Sir James Marshall-Cornwall, member of the Committee of Management of the CTAE, 1955-58.

===Blackwall Ice Stream===
A slightly S-shaped ice stream about long and wide. 
It descends from about high to high where it joins Recovery Glacier between Argentina Range and Whichaway Nunataks. 
It was named after Hugh Blackwall Evans (1874-1975), Canadian naturalist with the British Antarctic Expedition, 1898–1900, led by Carsten Borchgrevink.

===Whichaway Nunataks===
A group of rocky nunataks extending for and marking the south side of the mouth of Recovery Glacier. 
First seen from the air and visited in 1957 by the CTAE and so named because it was uncertain which route from the nunataks would lead furthest inland.

<doc id="1121520" wikidata="Q7065882" url="?curid=1121520" title="Now You See It (American game show)">
<text>Now You See It is an American television game show created by Frank Wayne for Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions. The object of &quot;Now You See It&quot; is to answer general knowledge trivia questions by finding the answers hidden in a grid, similar to a word search puzzle.

Two seasons were produced, both of which aired on CBS. The pilot was taped in October 1973, and featured six players instead of five, as well as a lack of neon lights on the front of the desks. The first series ran from April 1, 1974 to June 13, 1975, and was hosted by Jack Narz who was also hosting the syndicated revival of &quot;Concentration&quot;. Johnny Olson was the original announcer, with Gene Wood substituting on occasion. The second series ran from April 3, 1989 to July 14, 1989, and was hosted by Los Angeles news anchor Chuck Henry. Los Angeles disc jockey Mark Driscoll announced for the first month of the 1989 season, with Don Morrow replacing him for the remainder of the run.

==Gameplay==
===1974-75 version===
====Format #1====

The first round of &quot;Now You See It&quot; under its original format began with four new contestants split into two teams, each with one &quot;outside&quot; and one &quot;inside&quot; contestant. This round, called the Elimination Game, was played using a board of 56 letters that were arranged in four rows of 14, each row contained a series of overlapping words, read left to right. Rows and columns were numbered for scoring purposes, and were referred to respectively as &quot;lines&quot; and &quot;positions.&quot; The board was shown briefly to the four contestants, then turned off before any of them could fully memorize it.

The outside contestants turned their backs to the board as it was turned back on, and Narz asked a toss-up question for the inside contestants. The first one to buzz-in had to give the number of the line containing the correct answer. If he/she was correct, the other three lines were turned off, and the outside teammate turned to face the board and had to give both the answer and the position number of its starting letter. If the wrong line was given, the correct one was turned on and the outside contestant of the opposing team received a free guess at the answer. If an incorrect word was given, Narz gave the correct one and neither team scored. The point value for each correct answer was determined by adding its line and position numbers, for example, a word that started at position 9 in line 2 would be worth 11 points. Inside contestants could buzz-in before the host had finished a question, but in this case the outside contestant had to respond based only on the portion read to that point.

After each question, the entire board was turned on and the outside contestants turned their backs to it again. A total of 12 questions were played, with the members of each team trading places after the first six. The team in the lead at the end of the round advanced to the Semi-Finals, while their opponents were eliminated.

The members of the winning team competed against each other in the Semi-Finals, facing a board with four rows of 16 blanks each. Narz read a crossword-style clue, after which the letters of the answer were filled in one at a time as he said &quot;letter,&quot; starting at the far left end of the top row. Either contestant could buzz-in at any time, a correct answer scored one point and completed the word, but a miss gave the opponent a free guess before Narz resumed filling in the letters. If the word was not solved before its last letter was revealed, neither contestant scored. Each word after the first overlapped its predecessor by at least one letter, when the row became too full to accommodate any more words, play continued with a new word on the next row down.

The first player to guess four words won the round and a prize package, in addition to moving on to face the champion in the Finals. During the first two weeks, no prize package was given to the winner. The goal was increased from four words to five during the third week, this would become permanent when the second format was introduced.

The Finals followed the same rules as the Elimination Game, using a new board of 56 letters. A contestant who buzzed-in had to give first the line of the correct answer, then the answer and its position. After 12 questions, the higher-scoring contestant took/retained the championship and advanced to the Solo Game for a chance to win a cash jackpot. During the first episode only, a correct toss-up answer gave that contestant sole control of the round until he/she missed a question. The opponent could then take control by giving the correct answer, if he/she also missed, the next question was played as a toss-up. After the first episode, this format was abandoned and all words were played as toss-ups.

Beginning with the 101st episode and continuing until the adoption of the second main game format, contestants were asked to scan the board and write down one word from the board each at the beginning of each half of the Elimination Game and the Finals. A contestant or team earned a 10-point bonus for correctly answering a question with one of their chosen words, but had to reveal it immediately upon using it in order to score.

====Format #2====
On December 16, 1974, &quot;Now You See It&quot; underwent a significant change in format.

The game began with two new players playing the Qualifying Round, which was played in the exact same manner as the Semi-Finals prior to the change. Guessing five words first won the round and played against the returning champion in the Championship Round.

The Championship Round was played in the same manner as the Finals in the prior format, and the scoring format was still the same. The difference was that the goal was to reach 100 points first, as opposed to being ahead when the final bell rang. In addition, the values of all words were doubled once either contestant reached 50 points. Whoever reached 100 points first became champion and played the Solo Game for the jackpot. If the champion won the Solo Game, the contestant defeated returned for the next game as champion-designate.

Under this format, a new game began as soon as the previous Solo Game ended. Play continued until time ran out, then resumed on the next episode.

===1989 version===
On October 20, 1988, a pilot was filmed. When &quot;Now You See It&quot; was picked up in 1989, it kept the basic game format introduced late in the first series&#x27; run, with a qualifying round and a championship round. Like it had done with its recent revivals of &quot;Blockbusters&quot; and &quot;Concentration&quot; two years earlier, Mark Goodson Productions gave the show a technological upgrade with a computer generated board. The game was conducted on a three-tiered stage, with each round of play conducted on one of the three levels and covered by a large ring covered in chase lighting that was raised when play moved to that level and lowered when the round was over.

:Qualifying Round
The qualifying round was played on the first level and, as in the previous qualifying round, two contestants faced off to try to advance to face the day&#x27;s champion (or champion-designate). The object, still, was to find the words that fit the clues given by the host. Like before, the board consisted of four lines and fourteen letters.

The major difference came in scoring. Neither the lines nor the positions of the letters were numbered. Instead, the value for a correct answer was 100 points and decreased by five points for every third of a second that elapsed before someone buzzed in. The first contestant to buzz in had to give the line containing the answer, and then the word itself, to score. If the counter reached 25 points with no guesses, the contestants would be told what line the word was on to assist them.

The qualifying round consisted of two boards, with the second being played for double points. Originally, the second board was also played for the same number of points, with points doubling if time was running short.

The first person to 1,000 points moved on to face the champion in the next round of play.

:Championship Round
In the championship round, the winner of the qualifying round moved up to the second level and faced off against the returning champion, whose nametag had a crown atop of it so the audience knew. The two competed for cash and tried to be the first to reach or surpass $1,000.

The first board was worth $200, increasing by $100 for each one that followed. Every board had six hidden words that fit a specific category and was revealed to the audience and viewers first. After Henry revealed the category for the board in play, a window popped up in front of each contestant so they could see the board.

The first player to find a word fitting the category was given the chance to earn the monetary value of the board. To do so, he/she was shown the board again and given 20 seconds to locate the other five words in the category. Doing so won the board and the monetary value attached was added to their score. If either player failed to come up with the necessary five answers on their turn, the opposing player was given a chance to claim the money. Henry would remind him/her of what answers had already been given, and he/she was shown the board for five seconds to come up with one of the remaining answers, successfully doing so won the value of the board, while failure meant the first contestant claimed the board&#x27;s value.

The first contestant to reach or pass the $1,000 goal became champion, got to keep their bank, and advanced to the Solo Game.

===Solo Game (All versions)===
In the Solo Game, the champion was given one minute to find ten words on a brand new board. The champion viewed the board on a telestrator screen. On the original &quot;Now You See It&quot;, the Solo Game board had four rows of 16 letters each and the screen was embedded in Jack Narz&#x27;s desk. The 1989 series positioned their bonus area at center stage, with the podium on the third tier of the set. Inside the podium was the screen to display the computer generated board, which like all of the boards to that point was four rows of fourteen letters each.

After a clue was given, the champion had to find the relevant word, say it, and circle it with an electronic pencil. He/she could pass as often as desired, then return to those words after all ten clues had been given if time permitted. The champion could offer multiple guesses to the same clue, but could move on to the next one only by passing or finding the correct word.

The champion won a cash jackpot for finding all words before time expired, or $100 per found word otherwise. On both series, the Solo Game&#x27;s jackpot started at $5,000. For each unsuccessful playing on the original &quot;Now You See It&quot;, the jackpot increased by $1,000 to a maximum of $25,000. Any champion who won the jackpot immediately retired from the show, and the contestant he/she had defeated in the Finals became the champion-designate for the next show or match (depending on the format, as noted above the change resulted in games that straddled episodes). A contestant was not limited as champion otherwise, champions played until they were defeated or won the Solo Game. The highest jackpot in the Narz version that was won was $21,000.

On the 1989 revival, each loss in the Solo Game added $5,000 to the jackpot. Champions retired after playing the Solo Game five times or accumulating a total of $75,000 in winnings, whichever came first. The highest jackpot won in the Henry version was $50,000.

==Production information==
===Theme===
Both versions used the instrumental theme &quot;Chump Change,&quot; composed by Quincy Jones and Bill Cosby. For a brief period, the 1970s version used an alternate theme written by Edd Kalehoff, but returned to &quot;Chump Change&quot; shortly thereafter.

===Broadcast history===
====1974–1975====
The first version ran from April 1, 1974 to June 13, 1975 at 11:00 a.m. (10:00 Central) with Jack Narz hosting, replacing &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;, which moved to ABC one month after its CBS cancellation. Initially, it did well against Alex Trebek&#x27;s American debut on NBC (&quot;The Wizard of Odds&quot;) but, three months later, NBC gave Trebek a new show called &quot;High Rollers&quot; at that slot and &quot;Now You See It&quot; began to struggle while the producers altered the format several times. The show was taped at Television City Studios in Studio 33, the longtime home of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. Some episodes used Studio 41, which at the time was the stage of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Tattletales,&quot; another Goodson-Todman show.

NBC&#x27;s resurgence in its morning lineup in early 1975 with the likes of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; prompted CBS to clean house, canceling &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; along with &quot;Now You See It&quot;. &quot;Gambit&quot; (the show actually facing &quot;Wheel&quot;), which had begun in 1972 at 11/10, returned to that slot after &quot;Now You See It&quot;&#x27;s departure from the schedule.

This version aired occasionally on Game Show Network during the 1990s and 2000s until the network chose not to renew its contract with FremantleMedia (which now owns the Goodson-Todman library). The show currently airs as part of Buzzr&#x27;s weekday morning lineup. (9:30 a.m. EST)

====1989====
Years after the original &quot;Now You See It&quot; came to an end, Mark Goodson Productions decided to try the show again once a pilot was done on October 20, 1988. In 1989, CBS again aired the show on daytime, and the new &quot;Now You See It&quot; debuted on April 3 at 10:30 a.m. (9:30 a.m. Central) in place of &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, another Mark Goodson show, which had been airing in that timeslot since January 1986. Los Angeles news anchor Chuck Henry, was host, and the show was again taped at Studio 33 inside Television City in Hollywood.

Not only did it face its sister Mark Goodson-packaged game &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; on NBC, but the new &quot;Now You See It&quot; faced a vastly changed television market. Syndicated talk shows such as &quot;Donahue&quot; and &quot;Sally Jessy Raphael&quot; had become popular and made games like &quot;Now You See It&quot; seem tame and quaint. Daytime viewership declined since 1975, from a surge in cable and pay channels giving viewers more choices than ever. With greater possibility for local advertising revenue from the talk shows, numerous stations passed despite the solid performance of its lead-in, &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

Production of the syndicated game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, at that point the biggest ratings winner in syndication, had moved to Studio 33 at Television City for the upcoming seventh season after spending the previous six at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. Meanwhile, NBC had cancelled the daytime edition of &quot;Wheel&quot; that had aired since 1975 due to a decline in ratings. The final episode aired on June 30, 1989. CBS took advantage of &quot;Wheel&quot; in its studio space and relaunched the daytime series shortly after the show left Burbank. &quot;Now You See It&quot; was the only CBS morning show that was not performing well in the ratings, and the network declined to extend their commitment past the original fifteen weeks.

&quot;Now You See It&quot; came to an end on July 11, 1989 after seventy-five episodes. The show closed with the entire stage crew joining Chuck Henry and the day’s champion to bid farewell. &quot;Wheel&quot; launched the following Monday and lasted until January 11, 1991 in the time slot before finishing its run on NBC later that year.

<doc id="1121521" wikidata="Q840277" url="?curid=1121521" title="Going for the One">
<text>Going for the One is the eighth studio album by English progressive rock band Yes, released on 15 July 1977 by Atlantic Records. After taking a break in activity in 1975 for each member to release a solo album, and their 1976 tour of the United States and Canada, the band relocated to Montreux, Switzerland to record their next studio album. During rehearsals, keyboardist Patrick Moraz left the group, which marked the return of Rick Wakeman who had left to pursue a solo career after differences surrounding &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973). In a departure from their previous albums, &quot;Going for the One&quot;, with the exception of the fifteen-minute &quot;Awaken&quot;, features shorter and more direct songs without an overarching concept, and saw Yes record with new engineering personnel and cover artists.

&quot;Going for the One&quot; received a mostly positive response from music critics who welcomed the band&#x27;s return to more accessible music. It was a commercial success, reaching No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks and No. 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; and &quot;Going for the One&quot; were released as singles; the former went to No. 7 in the UK and remains the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the country. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) within a month for selling 500,000 copies. Yes supported the album with a six-month tour of the US, Canada and Europe. A remastered edition was released in 2003 containing previously unreleased tracks from the album&#x27;s recording sessions.

== Background ==

In August 1975, Yes wrapped their 1974–1975 tour of the US, Canada and the UK in support of their seventh studio album, &quot;Relayer&quot; (1974). The line-up during this time was lead vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, and keyboardist Patrick Moraz. For their next move, the group decided to take an extended break so each member could record and release a solo album. They regrouped for their Solo Albums Tour from May to August, which saw Yes perform some of their highest attended concerts. By October 1976, the band had become tax exiles and relocated to Montreux, Switzerland, to record a new studio album at Mountain Studios, their first studio album recorded overseas. They arrived at the studio when Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer were supposed to have finished &quot;Works&quot; (1977) but they were running overtime, leaving the group to work at a rehearsal space nearby for several weeks. A substantial amount of writing and arranging of their new material was done during this time.

In the first two months of writing and recording, Moraz was fired from the band, which he did not expect. Anderson thought he &quot;just wasn&#x27;t playing like he was involved&quot;, and that his sound was not &quot;too good, and that affected his vibe ... it was obvious that he just wasn&#x27;t getting off on what we were doing.&quot; Several months after his exit, Moraz said he had to leave because of &quot;the enormous psychological pressures at the time within the group ... I felt there were a few things going on that I didn&#x27;t know ... Unfortunately some people did not play the game fair, although the final decision was taken by all members.&quot; The decision was made after Rick Wakeman, who had left Yes in 1974 over differences surrounding their ambitious double album &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973) and whom Moraz replaced, was invited to play on &quot;Going for the One&quot; as a session musician by Yes manager Brian Lane and business partner Alex Scott. Wakeman had pursued a successful solo career, but by mid-1976 he faced financial problems after his tour earlier in the year had met its minimal targets. He became interested in playing with Yes again after he had heard a tape of early versions of two of their new songs, &quot;Going for the One&quot; and &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot;. Upon his arrival in Switzerland, Wakeman was surprised by how much the band had changed. &quot;We began relating to each other for the first time. I think we had all grown up and became much more mature. Maybe I had to grow up more than them.&quot;

At a subsequent party held by Claude Nobs, Lane and Squire convinced Wakeman to become a full-time member as the group would have difficulty in finding a suitable replacement to play Wakeman&#x27;s parts on their upcoming tour, but did not tell him that they had already informed the press of his return. Wakeman found out when he saw himself on the front cover of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, which had printed the news on 4 December 1976.

== Recording ==
The album was recorded from October 1976 to April 1977. In a departure from their previous four studio albums, Yes recorded &quot;Going for the One&quot; with new engineering personnel. Since 1970, they had worked with Eddy Offord who also mixed their sound in concert. After the &quot;Relayer&quot; tour, Offord thought the band&#x27;s style had become &quot;a bit stale&quot;, and thought a split was needed to work with other bands. Yes employed recording engineer John Timperley who was assisted by David Richards. In a first for the band, the album was solely produced by themselves. It is also the first engineering job for Yes&#x27; future sound mixer Nigel Luby, who &quot;did little more than watch and acquaint myself with the equipment.&quot; Squire recalled numerous heated arguments over the use of echo on the album, as the group were divided over its use.

The album marked a shift in the band&#x27;s musical style. Having based &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; and &quot;Relayer&quot; around extended or conceptual tracks, Yes decided to scale things back and record shorter and more accessible songs that critic and band biographer Chris Welch described as &quot;user friendly&quot;. In one instance, Howe recalled the band had started to arrange a five-minute introduction to a song before they scrapped the idea, as the group realised &quot;there are more ways of getting into songs [...] it was time to go back&quot;. Howe said that some songs originated from ideas &quot;from other eras&quot; of the band&#x27;s history, specifically &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; and parts of &quot;Awaken&quot;; Squire said that others were almost completely improvised in the studio, such as the long keyboard section to &quot;Awaken&quot; and various closing keyboard and guitar solos on other songs. Anderson spoke about the group&#x27;s direction at the time: &quot;The album is a kind of celebration [...] Over the last two or three years we&#x27;ve been experimenting a lot and we&#x27;re happy to have been given that chance. [...] We&#x27;ve come back to a happier medium. [...] If we wanted another &#x27;Tales&#x27; concept we would have gone in that direction, but we needed to relax for a while—a little more laughing and jive.&quot;

In addition to recording at Mountain Studios, &quot;Parallels&quot; and &quot;Awaken&quot; features the church organ at St. Martin&#x27;s in the town of Vevey (4 miles away from Montreux). The band considered using a mobile studio to record on location, but Timperley persuaded them to rent a telephone line due to their high fidelity and the ability to feed the line directly into the studio. &quot;Parallels&quot; was recorded with Wakeman in the church and the rest of the band in the studio; White counted the band in and they played the song through. On &quot;Awaken&quot;, the organ is an overdub. Wakeman described the experience as &quot;absolute magic&quot;. Wakeman changed his sound on the album with the use of a Polymoog, a polyphonic analogue synthesiser, which supplemented his traditional use of the Mellotron, Hammond organ, the RMI Electra Piano, and Minimoog synthesiser.

== Songs ==
=== Side one ===
&quot;Going for the One&quot; was originally written by Anderson around two or three years before the album was recorded. He had presented the song to the group at the time of writing, but the other members decided against recording it and the song was discarded. Squire rediscovered the song on a cassette which he brought into the studio one day, and it was chosen for further development. Howe plays a steel guitar for the entire song, an instrument he had introduced to the band on Close to the Edge; the introduction is what he had played during sound checks while on tour. Its meaning was inspired from various ideas, including sport, horse racing, a film he once saw about &quot;going down the Grand Canyon river on one of those rubber dinghies&quot;, and &quot;the cosmic mind&quot;. Some years later, he viewed the track as &quot;a dynamic piece of music&quot; that was an underrated and underplayed song in the band&#x27;s repertoire.

&quot;Turn of the Century&quot; is credited to Anderson, Howe and White, the only track on the album that credits Alan White as a writer. The song tells the story of Roan, a sculptor whose wife dies in the winter and, while in grief of her death, carves a statue of her and she is brought back to life. Anderson gained the idea from the opera &quot;La bohème&quot;, with additional inspiration from the Greek mythological figure Pygmalion, who falls in love with a statue of a woman that he carved. It was considerably shorter in length in its original form, but as the band continued to develop the song further Anderson suggested the song should tell the story musically before he added lyrics. White came up with the song&#x27;s chord sequences on piano and also wrote the initial vocal melody, which Anderson took a liking to and wrote words for: the chords were later developed further in certain sections by Howe. White also wrote the section where the drums incorporate the tympani towards the end. The opening minutes of the track became one of Howe&#x27;s favourite pieces of music by the band.

&quot;Parallels&quot; was part of a collection of songs that Squire had written for his solo album &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; (1975), but were left out due to the limited capacity of a vinyl record. He also felt the song did not fit with the style of the other tracks on his album. When it came to selecting songs for &quot;Going for the One&quot;, Squire suggested the song for the group to record, which was received well by the other members. Squire noted the juxtaposition of musical styles coming into play with his blues-oriented bass playing against Wakeman&#x27;s church organ. In its rough form, the song contained no guitar riffs. Squire said the lyrics are about &quot;a spiritual kind of love&quot; that offer a message of hope, a recurring theme of his lyrics.

=== Side two ===
&quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; is the second track on the album solely written by Anderson. He wrote the song during &quot;a beautiful day&quot; while living in Switzerland, &quot;one of those days you want to remember for years afterwards&quot;. During the day, the lyrics to the track entered his mind that he later wrote down. He noted the song&#x27;s meaning as &quot;the joys of life, as opposed to the uptightedness of some aspects of life&quot; that was inspired by romantic stories and &quot;a kind of dream sequence&quot;. White contributed the idea of the drums and bass playing on odd beats.

&quot;Awaken&quot; is a fifteen-minute track credited to Anderson and Howe. The music originated from an incident at a hotel when Anderson heard Howe repeatedly play a chord sequence on his guitar as he walked by, which led Anderson to sing some lyrical ideas on top of it on tape. Howe had written the beginning of the guitar solo previously, which was originally to be a part of a solo guitar piece. Anderson&#x27;s main source of inspiration for the song was the book &quot;The Singer: A Classic Retelling of Cosmic Conflict&quot; (1975) by Calvin Miller, which he had read during his time in Switzerland. The book retells the story of Jesus in the form of an allegorical poem about a singer whose song could not be silenced. Anderson drew further inspiration from reading a biography on the Dutch painter Rembrandt, which had affected him &quot;quite significantly&quot;. Moraz wrote an introduction for the song which was not used, but was adapted into &quot;Time for a Change&quot; on his solo album &quot;Out in the Sun&quot; (1977). Anderson wished to incorporate the harp into the song&#x27;s middle section and &quot;dream the audience, sort of Vivaldi&quot;, and later considered the song&#x27;s lyrics and its final section with Wakeman&#x27;s keyboards to be particularly strong. The track features choral passages performed by the Richard Williams Singers, whose musical arrangements were directed by Wakeman, and the Ars Laeta of Lausanne, recorded at the Église des Planches, a church in Montreux. An early version of the song&#x27;s introduction was performed live during the band&#x27;s final gig on the &quot;Relayer&quot; tour, in 1975.

== Artwork ==
In addition to a change of producers and engineers, &quot;Going for the One&quot; also marked a departure in the cover artists. Since 1971, they had worked with Roger Dean who became known for his surreal and fantastical landscapes and designed their distinctive logo. While the band were recording Dean presented his idea for the cover painting, which had pieces of rock floating in the sky with the largest piece containing trees and a pool of water. The design was to be a conceptual sequel to his work produced on their first live album, &quot;Yessongs&quot; (1973). Dean said he flew to Montreux to discuss his ideas with the band but only met with Anderson, who was uninterested in his suggestions and instead, presented a rough design of what he wanted Dean to create. Anderson, however, claimed that while the band approached Dean to design the cover, he was unwilling to visit them. Howe claimed &quot;a certain member&quot; was no longer interested in working with Dean, which ended their collaboration until &quot;Drama&quot; (1980); in his 2021 memoir &quot;All My Yesterdays&quot; he attributes that to a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.

The band commissioned Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis to design the artwork. They came up with a marked change in direction that represented a new, revitalised attitude within the band and their return to more direct and concise songs. Artist George Hardie contributed to the graphical design. Presented as a triple gatefold sleeve, the front cover depicts the back of a standing nude male looking at the Century Plaza Towers in Century City, California against a blue sky. By the time the album was released Yes had acquired full ownership of Dean&#x27;s logo, which they previously had co-owned, and used it on the cover. Dean is credited in the liner notes. Inside features a photograph of each band member by Lake Geneva and Île de Peilz, an island on the lake that consists of a single tree. Richard Manning, a freelance artist who worked for Hipgnosis at the time, used double weighted photo paper to accommodate the triple gatefold. He applied various techniques onto the design including a light blue dye wash, clouds added with an airbrush, and photomontage. The coloured lines running through the cover were added at the printing stage. Anderson said the lines intersecting through the male define &quot;points of the anatomy relative to our development.&quot;

Howe was not &quot;thrilled&quot; at the design at the time of release, but said it worked well with the music and was pleased that Dean&#x27;s logo was retained; in 2021 he said he had &quot;no hard feelings&quot; about it. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reporter and band biographer Chris Welch wrote about the cover: &quot;Gone were the elaborate Roger Dean landscapes. In their place came stark, geometric simplicity. Anticipating computer designs of the future ... it symbolised a new look for Yes&quot;. Martin Popoff reviewed the design in 2016. &quot;A new accelerated, late-&#x27;70s escapism through the clean lines of Hipgnosis, who combine slick, futuristic geometric urban angles with a man in his birthday suit, perhaps urgently propelling the band forward, while simultaneously embracing roots&quot;.

When released, the record label promoted the album with an outdoor advertising campaign. Howe recalled that one billboard with the album cover art on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles covered up the man&#x27;s buttocks and thighs with a pair of trousers. He was bemused that anyone would have taken offence at the original image, particularly the &quot;pimps, drug dealers and loose women&quot; who frequented the street.

==Release==
&quot;Going for the One&quot; was released in the US on 12 July 1977 and in the UK on 15 July 1977, available on LP, audio cassette, and 8-track tape. Its release was delayed after various problems were encountered with the pressing. It became a commercial success for the band, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart, their second album to do so following &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;, for two weeks in August 1977 and peaking at number 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Elsewhere, the album went to number 7 in Norway. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 2 August 1977 for selling over 500,000 copies in the US. In the UK, the album reached silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 19 September 1977, signifying 60,000 copies sold and sales worth over £150,000.

The album spawned two singles, both released in 1977. &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; was released with &quot;Parallels&quot; as the B-side which peaked at number 7 in the UK singles chart. To help promote the song, Yes filmed their first music video for the song which received airplay on the BBC television music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. It remains the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the country. The second, &quot;Going for the One&quot; with an edited version of &quot;Awaken Pt. 1&quot; on the B-side, reached number 24 in the UK.

==Reception==

In his review for &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Steve Pond believed the album succeeds because the band had &quot;lowered rather than raised its sights. By going back to basics rather than trying to top its previous &#x27;extravaganzas&#x27;, Yes has produced its most appealing collection&quot; since &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. He praised the &quot;refreshing energy&quot; the album brings, but noted their &quot;kitchen-sink approach to song-writing, throwing everything into a composition but sometimes failing to smoothly integrate the disparate elements&quot;. In &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, reviewer Robin Smith gave the album five &quot;+&quot;, the highest ranking which means &quot;Unbeatable&quot;. He praised the title track, which opens the album with &quot;an uncharacteristic piece of boogie&quot; and has atmosphere and an effective ending. Smith concluded that with the album, &quot;Yes dispel all your fears that the band are over the hill and finished [...] they&#x27;re back stronger than ever.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; gave a positive review, noting the band &quot;is clearly going all out here to create its most ambitious and awesome work yet&quot;, and picked the title track, &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot;, and &quot;Awaken&quot; as the best cuts.

In a retrospective review, biographer and reporter Chris Welch welcomed the album after the more complex material on &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; and &quot;Relayer&quot;, citing its &quot;melodic simplicity&quot; which was &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot; and still stood up strong at the time of his review. He praised Wakeman&#x27;s performance and the band&#x27;s choice in incorporating his talents into the music more effectively, which was not the case on &quot;Tales&quot;. He praised every track, calling &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; a tune that allowed the group &quot;to fly without really trying&quot; and the closing moments of &quot;Awaken&quot;, in particular, &quot;quite beautiful ... the kind of music making now almost a lost art&quot;. Ross Boissoneau, for AllMusic, described &quot;Going for the One&quot; as &quot;perhaps the most overlooked item in the Yes catalog ... In many ways, this disc could be seen as the follow-up to &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971). Its five tracks still retain mystical, abstract lyrical images, and the music is grand and melodic, the vocal harmonies perfectly balanced by the stinging guitar work of Steve Howe, Wakeman&#x27;s keyboards, and the solid rhythms of Alan White and Chris Squire&quot;. He called &quot;Awaken&quot; an &quot;evocative track&quot; with lyrics &quot;spacey in the extreme&quot;, but praised Anderson and Squire&#x27;s vocals and the addition of Anderson&#x27;s harp and White&#x27;s tuned percussion. Paul Stump&#x27;s 1997 &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot; noted &quot;Going for the One&quot; was a surprise triumph for Yes, achieving both critical and commercial success despite arriving in the middle of the &quot;summer of Punk&quot; and after a nearly three-year hiatus from the studio. He singled out &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; (&quot;a masterstroke of textural finesse&quot;) and &quot;Parallels&quot; (&quot;a bullying piece of music-making which careers along with intimidating speed and violence, culminating contrapuntally in one of Yes&#x27;s most adrenalized climaxes yet&quot;) as the highlights.

==Tour==

Yes supported &quot;Going for the One&quot; with a tour of the US, Canada and Europe that ran from 30 July to 6 December 1977, and featured Donovan as their opening act. The stage set had a much simpler design compared to the band&#x27;s previous three tours, which centred around a series of illuminated shapes which gave a three-dimensional effect. Wakeman&#x27;s keyboards were arranged on two levels. Anderson was illuminated in multiple colours as he sung an excerpt of &quot;The Beautiful Land&quot; from the musical &quot;The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd&quot;. The tour included a record six consecutive sold out nights at Wembley Arena in London that were attended by over 50,000 people. In order to play the different bass parts on &quot;Awaken&quot;, Squire used a custom triple-necked bass made in 1975 by Wal for Roger Newell, the bassist in Wakeman&#x27;s band the English Rock Ensemble. Recordings from the European tour were released on Yes&#x27;s second live album, &quot;Yesshows&quot; (1981).

Yes selected &quot;Going for the One&quot; for their first Album Series Tour from March 2013 to June 2014, with the album performed live in its entirety and in track order.

==Reissues==
&quot;Going for the One&quot; was first reissued on CD across Europe in 1988. A digitally remastered CD followed in 1994 made by George Marino at Sterling Sound studios. In 2003, Rhino and Elektra Records released a new digitally remastered CD with seven bonus tracks. 2013 saw two remastered &quot;audiophile&quot; versions put out, one by Audio Fidelity for the Super Audio CD format and the other by Friday Music releasing a 180-gram LP using analog tape dubs since the original tapes were missing.

<text>Kamakiriad is the second solo album by Steely Dan artist Donald Fagen, released in 1993. It was his first collaboration with Steely Dan partner Walter Becker since 1986, on Rosie Vela&#x27;s album &quot;Zazu&quot;. Becker played guitar and bass and produced the album. The album is a futuristic, optimistic eight-song cycle about the journey of the narrator in his high-tech car, the &quot;Kamakiri&quot; (Japanese for praying mantis). It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year 1994.

Music videos were produced for &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Girls&quot; (starring Rick Moranis) and &quot;Snowbound&quot; (using stop motion animation).

Fagen and Becker embarked on their first tour as Steely Dan since 1974 to support the album.

<doc id="1121527" wikidata="Q1312088" url="?curid=1121527" title="Ashtabula River railroad disaster">
<text>The Ashtabula River railroad disaster (also called the Ashtabula horror, the Ashtabula Bridge disaster, and the Ashtabula train disaster) was caused by the collapse of a bridge over the Ashtabula River near the town of Ashtabula, Ohio, in the United States on December 29, 1876. A Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway train, the Pacific Express, was passing over the bridge as it collapsed. All but the lead locomotive plunged into the river. The train&#x27;s oil lanterns and coal-fired heating stoves set the wooden cars alight. Firefighters declined to extinguish the flames, leaving individuals to try to pull survivors from the wreck. Many who survived the crash burned to death in the wreckage. The accident killed approximately 92 of the 160 people aboard. It was the worst rail accident in the U.S. in the 19th century and the worst rail accident in U.S. history until the Great Train Wreck of 1918. It remains the third-deadliest rail accident in U.S. history.

The coroner&#x27;s report found that the bridge, located about from the railway station, had been improperly designed by the railroad company president, poorly constructed, and inadequately inspected. As a result of the accident, a hospital was built in the town and a federal system set up to formally investigate fatal railroad accidents.

==Design and construction of the bridge==
In 1863, officials of the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad (CP&amp;A; one of the predecessors of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway), decided to replace the wooden bridge over the Ashtabula River just east of the village of Ashtabula, Ohio, with an iron structure. Amasa Stone was president of the CP&amp;A. His construction firm had built the CP&amp;A main line from 1850 to 1852, and Stone had purchased the patent rights to brother-in-law William Howe truss bridge in 1842. Stone resolved to construct a Howe truss bridge, a commonly used type of railroad bridge, and personally designed the new bridge. The longest span was long and above the river below.

Stone also decided to award the contract for the ironwork to the Cleveland Rolling Mill (then known as Stone, Chisholm &amp; Jones Company), an iron and steel company based in Cleveland, Ohio, which was managed by his older brother, Andros Stone. The I-beams were made by the mill. The mill also provided raw iron to the CP&amp;A, which then made the cast and wrought iron elements according to the fabrication plans. Shop master mechanic Albert Congdon oversaw this latter work.

===Design===

Amasa Stone&#x27;s bridge was, by his own admission, experimental. He had constructed only one all-iron Howe truss bridge before, a high, long railroad bridge over the Ohio and Erie Canal in Cleveland. 

Joseph Tomlinson, a well-known bridge builder and designer, was hired to flesh out Stone&#x27;s design and create the fabrication drawings for all the bridge components. Tomlinson designed the bridge&#x27;s lower chord to have a camber of . When the falsework supporting the bridge was removed and the dead load of the bridge came into play, the camber would drop to between . Tomlinson was alarmed when Stone demanded that the bridge be constructed completely of iron, rather than a combination of wood and iron. An all-iron bridge would have a much greater dead load, reducing the bridge&#x27;s live load (its ability to carry trains). He also concluded that the beams and posts Stone intended to use were undersized. Tomlinson proposed riveting plates to the I-beams to strengthen them, but Stone angrily refused. Stone demanded that Tomlinson make the changes he required. Tomlinson refused, and was fired from the design effort. Stone then ordered the CP&amp;A&#x27;s chief engineer, Charles Collins, to make the desired changes to the bridge design. Collins refused, and was fired from the design effort. Stone then made the changes to the design.

Stone made additional changes to the design. In a Howe truss bridge, the vertical posts connect the upper and lower chords (main parallels) in the truss. The deck on which the train travels usually hangs from these posts; the greater the live load, the greater the tension on the posts. The bracing reacts in compression, counteracting the tension. Amasa Stone inverted this design so that only the upper chord (now at the bottom of the bridge) provided tension. Where diagonal braces did not receive the extra compression from a live load, inverted Howe truss bridges had a tendency to buckle where the vertical posts were attached to the deck with cast iron angle blocks. Stone&#x27;s other major change involved the end panels. In the traditional Howe truss bridge, the end panel on each side of each end of the bridge has three vertical posts and three diagonal braces. Only five Howe truss bridges ever built by 1863 had just one vertical post and two diagonal braces in the end panels. These were known as &quot;Single Howe&quot; bridges. Amasa Stone used the &quot;Single Howe&quot; design for the end panels at Ashtabula. Thus, the bridge&#x27;s entire structure relied on just 12 beams and posts (three at each end).

===Design of the angle blocks===

Gasparini and Fields claim that the exact design of the angle blocks and the ends (the &quot;bearings&quot;) of the diagonals are lost to history.

Civil engineer Charles MacDonald, who inspected the bridge&#x27;s original plans in 1877, described and made drawings of part of the angle blocks. He noted that the vertical posts were made of iron pipe in diameter with a wall thick. Inside the pipe ran an iron rod thick. The top of the rod passed through the space between the members of the chord at the top of the bridge and then through a gib-plate. A nut and washer screwed onto the upper end of the rod, creating tension as well as securing the gib-plate in place. Those angle blocks at the top of the bridge had vertical, squarish lugs. Those members of the chord which ended atop an angle block had their bearings placed against the lug. These lugs served to transmit stress from the chord to the angle block and thence to the diagonals. These upper angle blocks also had lugs facing inward, to which were attached (by means MacDonald did not describe) the lateral braces. The interior side of each upper angle block also had a recess to accept a lug and a tap bolt. The tap bolt was used to connect the lug on the end of the sway rod to the angle block.

MacDonald described (but did not publish a drawing of) the angle blocks at the bottom of the bridge. The bottom of the rod in the vertical posts screwed into these angle blocks.
The members of the chord at the bottom of the bridge were flat bars, not I-beams, each bar measuring . Where a member of the chord ended at an angle block, a lug was forged at the base of the bar. This lug fit into a slot in the angle block. The angle blocks which made up the chord at the bottom of the bridge also had lugs facing inward, to which were attached (by means MacDonald did not describe) the lateral braces.

MacDonald and Gasparini and Fields noted that the diagonal I-beams were designed to connect to both the upper and lower angle blocks with the flanges of the I-beam in a vertical position. The web of the I-beam fit into a horizontal slot between two lugs.

It is also known that, at the ends of the bridge, only half of each angle block received load because Stone used only a single diagonal in the end panel. This put enormous shear stress on the bridgeward side of these angle blocks.

===Construction===

The Ashtabula River bridge was erected in 1865 using Stone&#x27;s design and plans and partly under his supervision. Tomlinson was the bridge&#x27;s original construction supervisor, but Stone said he fired him for &quot;inefficiency&quot; at some point during the bridge&#x27;s construction. Tomlinson was replaced by A. L. Rogers.

When construction began, Tomlinson observed that the I-beams intended for use as diagonals were smaller than the fabrication plans called for.

The amount of camber created a problem during construction. At Congdon&#x27;s suggestion, Rogers built falsework to support construction of a bridge with a camber. Stone, now himself supervising Rogers&#x27; work, ordered the camber reduced to . With the members of the upper chord now too long, Rogers had the bearings shaved down. It is clear Rogers ordered other changes as well, but it is uncertain what these included. Gasparini and Fields suggest he had the lugs atop the angle block planed down as well. When the falsework began to be removed, the dead load caused the bridge to bend about below horizontal. The bridge was jacked up and the falsework put back in place. Stone then ordered the chord members to be returned to their original lengths, restoring Tomlinson&#x27;s intended camber. Rather than ordering new I-beams, Rogers used shims to close the space between the bearings and the lugs.

When the falsework was removed a second time, the bridge buckled where the vertical posts connected to the deck. Several diagonals also buckled. Once more, the falsework went back in place.

To correct this problem, Stone added more iron I-beams to the diagonals to strengthen them. The placement, size, and number of beams added is not clear, but Stone likely added two I-beams to the brace in the end panel, two I-beams to the brace in the first panel from the end, and one I-beam to the second panel from the end. This worsened the bridge&#x27;s dead load problem. Collins, Congdon, Rogers, and Stone all later testified that the I-beams making up the diagonals were now turned 90 degrees, so that the flanges were horizontal. Congdon says that he realized the I-beams would carry more live load if they were rotated. Collins, Rogers, and Stone believed workers had installed the beams incorrectly (on their sides). To make the change, Stone had workers cut away portions of each diagonal I-beam&#x27;s web at the bearing, enabling the web to fit over the lugs. This weakened the new diagonals. There is also some evidence that the angle blocks were damaged while the braces and counter-braces were rotated. 

The bridge was prestressed again. In every other panel connection, the diagonal braces were fitted to the angle blocks using shims rather than by tightening the vertical posts and putting the diagonals under compression. This meant that the shims carried the weight of a live load, rather than the braces themselves. It is also possible that the shims created uneven contact, causing angle blocks to undergo both bending and shear stress. Nevertheless, the bridge did not sag this time.

Upon completion, the bridge was tested by having three locomotives run over the bridge at speed. A second test had the three engines stand still on the bridge. Deflection was minimal and the bridge rebounded satisfactorily.

==Bridge collapse and fire==
===Blizzard conditions===
Train No. 5 of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, known as &quot;The Pacific Express&quot;, left Buffalo, New York, at 2 PM on December 29, 1876, 1 hour and 8 minutes behind schedule. A powerful blizzard had begun hitting northern Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania, and western New York two days earlier. More than of snow had already fallen, and winds were creating heavy snowdrifts on the railroad tracks deep in places. The snow was so heavy that, shortly after leaving Buffalo, a second engine was added to help pull the train.

The train left Erie, Pennsylvania, at 5:01 PM, an hour and 16 minutes behind schedule. Its two locomotives, &quot;Socrates&quot; and &quot;Columbia,&quot; were hauling two baggage cars, two day-passenger coaches, two express coaches, a drawing room car (the &quot;Yokohama&quot;), three sleeper cars (the &quot;Palatine&quot;, which originated in New York City and was bound for Chicago; the &quot;City of Buffalo&quot;, which originated in Boston and was bound for Chicago; and the &quot;Osceo&quot;, a sleeper for passengers going to St. Louis), and a smoking car with about 150 to 200 passengers and 19 crew aboard. Two additional locomotives were needed to push the train away from the station due to the heavy snow.

===Initial collapse and survival of the &quot;Socrates&quot;===
The No. 5 was due to arrive in Cleveland at 7:05 PM, but at about 7:30 PM it was just reaching Ashtabula—an hour and 53 minutes behind schedule. About half an hour earlier, the No. 8 passenger train of the LS&amp;MS passed over the Ashtabula River bridge without incident, heading east. The bridge over the Ashtabula River was about east of the Ashtabula station, and the locomotives shut off their steam (cutting off power to the drive) about east of the bridge to allow the train to glide into the station. As the &quot;Pacific Express&quot; crossed the bridge, it was doing (according to the locomotive engineers). Visibility was practically nonexistent, at most one or two car lengths.

As the &quot;Socrates&quot; neared the western abutment, engineer Daniel McGuire heard a crack and felt his locomotive drop slowly downward. Realizing the bridge was collapsing beneath him, he opened the throttle to maximum. The &quot;Socrates&quot; lurched ahead, just as the weight of the 11 cars began to pull on the &quot;Columbia&quot; behind it. The connection between the two locomotives snapped, enabling the &quot;Socrates&quot; to make it off the bridge. The rear trucks on his tender hung in the air, but the forward movement of the &quot;Socrates&quot; pulled the tender forward and it regained the rails and solid ground. McGuire brought the &quot;Socrates&quot; to a halt about down the track, and began repeatedly sounding his whistle and ringing the train bell in alarm.

===Collapse of the remaining bridge===
The &quot;Columbia&quot; and the 11 cars behind it acted like a linked chain load. The bridge&#x27;s collapse was therefore not sudden, but rather somewhat slow and piecemeal. The &quot;Columbia&quot; struck the abutment, the engine supported by the stonework while the tender hung downward toward the river valley. The first express car fell into the ravine, crashing nose-first into the ground at the base of the abutment. The &quot;Columbia&quot; slipped backward off the abutment, landing upside-down and backward atop the first express car. It then fell onto its side, its trucks pointing north.

The second express car and the two baggage cars landed largely upright, slightly south of the bridge. The second baggage car was slightly askew, its nose resting against the western abutment and its rear pointing southeast. Most of the bridge&#x27;s upper chord (the bottom of the bridge) crashed to the ground north of the bridge. The lower chord (at the top of the bridge) and what remained of the deck held for a moment, then fell directly down to land atop the locomotive, express cars, and baggage cars. Momentum pulled the rest of the train into the space where the bridge used to be. The first passenger coach landed upright in mid-stream atop the wreckage of the bridge and the second express car. The second passenger car twisted in the air as it fell, landing on its side atop the bridge and first baggage car. The smoking car, having broken free of the passenger coach ahead of it, moved more freely. It struck the forward part of the second passenger coach, crushing it, before being propelled into the first passenger coach. (It is widely believed most people in the first passenger coach died when the smoking car fell on them.)

Momentum also carried the parlor car &quot;Yokohama&quot; and the three sleeper cars into the chasm. All of them landed about south of the bridge. The &quot;Yokohama&quot; landed upright in mid-stream, and the sleeper &quot;Palatine&quot; landed mostly right-side up beside it to the north. The sleeper &quot;City of Buffalo&quot; then nose-dived into the rear of the &quot;Palatine&quot;, partially crushing it and killing several people. It continued through the &quot;Palatine&quot; into the rear of the &quot;Yokohama&quot;, pushing the parlor car onto its side. The &quot;Buffalo&quot; smashed forward along the length of the parlor car, likely killing everyone inside. The rear of the &quot;Buffalo&quot; lay atop the &quot;Palatine&quot;, high in the air. An eyewitness said no one in the &quot;City of Buffalo&quot; survived the crash. The final sleeper, the &quot;Osceo&quot;, landed on the east bank of the river, mostly upright.

===Fire and deaths===
The crash was heard at the railroad&#x27;s W. 32nd Street Station (just to the west of the bridge) and in the town, and the alarm was raised. Rescuers first on the scene included railroad employees, those waiting on the platform at the station, and residents of Ashtabula who lived near the bridge. The only access to the valley floor was a set of steep, narrow steps, covered in snow. Most people slid down the steep incline rather than take the steps, and several people brought axes to help free survivors.

The wooden cars burst into flame when their coal- and kerosene-fed heating stoves and oil lamps overturned. An early report said fire broke out in the &quot;Osceo&quot; and in at least three other places, and within a minute the entire wreck was ablaze. Historian Darrell E. Hamilton says the fire broke out at either end, and moved toward the middle. According to rear brakeman A.H. Stone, those still left alive in the wreckage were dead within 20 minutes. By the time rescuers reached the bridge, many wounded passengers had already made their way to the shore and the fire was burning fiercely. 

The response by the Ashtabula Fire Brigade was minimal. G.W. Knapp, the city&#x27;s fire chief, was an alcoholic who even when sober was slow to make decisions and easily confused. The Lake Erie Hose Company&#x27;s hand- and steam-pumped horse-drawn fire engines arrived first, but Knapp never gave any orders to fight the flames. He told a bystander that there was no use in fighting the fire, even though it was plain that some survivors were still trapped in the wreck. Railroad employees also told Knapp that his firefighters should get the wounded out and clear a pathway up the side of the ravine. At least one member of the town begged Knapp to put water on the flames, but he refused. Instead, the townspeople secured buckets and (with the help of some members of the fire brigade) tried to put out the blaze. The Protection Fire Company&#x27;s hand-pumped engine and the Neptune Hose Company&#x27;s steam-pumper (both horse-drawn) were hauled more than a mile through town to the bridge, but arrived too late to stop the spread of the fire.

The darkness and blinding snow made it difficult for surviving passengers to orient themselves and get out of the wreck. A number of passengers drowned in the river, while others escaped the blaze only to die of smoke inhalation.

The injured and dying were either carried up the steep steps or hauled up the incline on sleds or sleighs pulled up by rope. There was no hospital in Ashtabula. The injured were first taken to the railroad engine house, to the filthy and run-down Eagle Hotel adjacent to the station, or to the nearby Ashtabula House hotel. As these places filled, residents opened their homes to the survivors. Ambulatory injured were the last to be hauled up from the valley. By midnight, all the survivors had reached safety. The 10 doctors in the village attended to the wounded. About 1 AM, a special train arrived from Cleveland carrying railroad officials and five more surgeons. 

Thieves moved among the dead and wounded, stealing money and valuables. A large crowd of the curious gathered at the wreck site the next morning, and some in the crowd looted the train until Ashtabula&#x27;s mayor, H. P. Hepburn, stationed a guard at the site. Some of the money and valuables were discovered following investigations by local police, and a few arrests made. Hepburn later issued a proclamation promising amnesty for anyone else who turned over stolen items. Money and valuables worth about $1,500 ($ in dollars) were collected, but most of the stolen money and goods were never recovered.

The number of people killed in the Ashtabula bridge disaster will never be known. The number could be as low as 87 or as high as 200, although the official count is 92 dead. Another 64 people were injured. The number of deaths is inexact, in part because the number of passengers on the train is difficult to estimate and in part because many remains were partial (a hand, a leg, a torso). Most (although not all) remains recovered from the wreck were burned beyond recognition and could not be identified from clothing or personal items. An unknown number of the dead were essentially cremated in the blaze. Among the dead was hymn writer Philip Bliss.

===Identifying and burying the dead===
Identification of the dead took a week or more. There were full or partial remains of about 36 bodies in the railroad freight house, with concerned families encouraged to come by and try to identify corpses. For several days after the wreck, townspeople and railroad employees used their hands and feet, hoes, rakes, and shovels to dig through the ash, ice, mud, and snow to find any personal items they could. These items—which included partially burned train tickets, diaries, photographs, watches, jewelry, unique or rare items of clothing, or keepsakes—were kept by the railroad. When a corpse could not be identified, grieving families sometimes were able to use these &quot;relics&quot; to confirm that a loved one had been aboard the train. Even so, identifying objects or papers often were separated from remains, and misidentification of remains was common.

Concerned friends and family members sent letters and telegrams in the hundreds to railroad and civic authorities, seeking knowledge of their loved ones. These contained descriptions of the alleged passenger, as well as any identifying personal effects. Some of these letters were fraudulent, sent by people seeking gold watches, jewelry, or other items as &quot;loot&quot;. Fraudulent letters tended to be spotted fairly easily, and were not answered.

Wreck investigators were still turning up remains as late as mid-January.

A burial service for the unidentified dead was held at Ashtabula&#x27;s Chestnut Grove Cemetery on January 19, 1877. A mile-long procession conveyed the dead to the cemetery. The railroad purchased a burial plot in which 18 coffins, containing the remains of an estimated 22 people, were placed.

Three coffins with three corpses remained at the freight house in the hope that they could still be identified. When these remains went unclaimed, they were buried about a week later in the same plot at Chestnut Grove.

==Investigation==

At dawn on December 30, Ashtabula resident Fred W. Blakeslee took photos of the wrecked bridge and train. These provide the most extensive documentation of the wreck known as of 2003.

Three investigations were made into the disaster.

===Conclusions by the coroner&#x27;s jury===
There being no coroner in Ashtabula, a coroner&#x27;s jury of six men from the town was convened by Justice of the Peace Edward W. Richards on December 31. The jury took testimony from 20 railroad officials and employees (including both locomotive engineers and the rear brakeman), nine members of the Ashtabula fire department, 10 residents of Ashtabula, six passengers, and eight civil engineers and bridge builders. The coroner&#x27;s jury submitted its report on March 8, 1877.

The coroner&#x27;s jury blamed the collapse of the Ashtabula River bridge and the deaths by fire on five factors:

#The bridge was poorly designed. An all-iron Howe truss was unsuitable for such a long bridge. Some of the members of the chords and braces were not designed to be of sufficient strength, and were poorly placed. The lateral cross-bracing was so underdesigned as to be of little value. The angle blocks had too few and poorly designed lugs, which did not keep the braces and counter-braces from slipping out of place.
#The bridge was poorly constructed. Each member of the bridge acted independently instead of being positively connected to its neighbors. Some of the vertical posts, braces, and cross-braces were put in the wrong places. To accommodate design changes during the bridge&#x27;s strengthening, the lugs on the angle blocks and the flanges on the I-beams of the chords were cut away in part, reducing their strength and effectiveness. The construction of the yokes used to bind the braces and counter-braces was poor, and shims were used to compensate for chord members which were too short. The modifications made to the bridge before its completion used thick members where thin ones were required, and thin ones where thick ones should have been used.
#Railroad bridge inspectors did not perform their jobs adequately. Inspectors should have noted the severe deficiencies in the bridge&#x27;s design and construction, and did not. They also should have observed problems with members becoming loose over time.
#The railroad failed to use self-extinguishing heating stoves, as required by state law passed on May 4, 1869.
#The fire was worsened by the failure of those on the scene to attempt to douse the flames. The Lake Erie Hose Company&#x27;s hand pump and steam pump, first on the scene, could have saved lives. The Neptune Hose Company&#x27;s steam pump and the Protection Fire Company&#x27;s hand pump were hauled more than through snowdrifts, but arrived too late.

Amasa Stone was held personally responsible for the bridge&#x27;s poor design, and the railroad company for the lax inspection of the bridge and the failure to use self-extinguishing heating apparatus. G.W. Knapp was held personally responsible for failing to fight the fire in a timely fashion.

===Conclusions by the state legislative joint committee===
On January 1, 1877, the Ohio General Assembly adopted a joint resolution appointing a committee to investigate the causes of the Ashtabula River bridge collapse, and to make recommendations to the legislature. The committee consisted of five members of the Ohio House of Representatives and three members of the Ohio Senate. Senator A.M. Burns chaired the committee. The joint committee hired three civil engineers (Benjamin F. Bowen, John Graham, and Thomas H. Johnson) to examine the wreckage and report to the committee regarding the bridge&#x27;s design and performance. The committee also received written reports from civil engineers Albert S. Howland and W.S. Williams, and took personal testimony from civil engineer M.J. Becker and from railroad officials and employees Amasa Stone, Charles Collins, Albert Congdon, A.L. Rogers, and Gustavus Folsom (engineer of the &quot;Columbia&quot;). Technical advice was provided by civil engineers D.W. Caldwell and J.E. Wright. The coroner&#x27;s jury granted the joint committee full access to all of its testimony and reports as well. In appendices to its report, the joint committee printed in full the coroner&#x27;s jury testimony of civil engineers A. Gottlieb, John D. Crehore, and Joseph Tomlinson.

The legislative joint committee issued its report on January 30, 1877. The committee blamed the collapse of the Ashtabula River bridge on three factors:

#The bridge&#x27;s design was flawed. Nothing in the design prevented the lateral buckling of the braces or the upper chord. Only a part of the upper chord was designed to transmit load to the angle blocks, and the lugs on the angle blocks were poorly designed (so that strain could not be fully transmitted to the braces and counter-braces). The bridge was apparently designed for a non-moving live load, and little evidence existed to show it was designed to accommodate jarring, oscillation, vibration, or the force of wind.
#There were significant errors in construction. The members making up the braces were not connected to act in unison, greatly reducing the bridge&#x27;s ability to carry a live load. In the lower chord, lateral braces were placed only at every other panel connection, extended across two panels (not one), and were not connected to one another where they crossed. The sway braces were too small to prevent sway, and placed only at every other panel as well. Neither the braces nor counter-braces were attached to the angle blocks, and their ends were not square.
#The defects in design and construction could have been identified by careful inspection at any time, but the railroad&#x27;s inspectors did not identify these problems. Many braces and counter-braces had fallen out of position before the bridge collapsed, something inspectors either did not notice or the railroad did not repair.

The committee found no defects in materials, and rejected the idea that application of the air brakes by the second locomotive caused the bridge to collapse.

===Conclusions of the MacDonald investigation===
A third investigation was conducted independently by civil engineer Charles MacDonald, who likely was commissioned to study the bridge&#x27;s collapse by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

MacDonald blamed three factors for the bridge&#x27;s failure:
#Improper inspection by railroad officials. He noted, however, that the LS&amp;MS was not alone in infrequent inspection by largely untrained men.
#An inadequate knowledge of the strength of iron. The whole industry suffered from a lack of this knowledge, he wrote.
#The failure of a mis-cast lug.

MacDonald believed the bridge collapsed due to a flaw in the southernmost lug at the top of the first full angle block from the west end. He noted that the lugs atop the angle blocks on the bridge had, for some reason, been shaved down to from . This significantly weakened the ability of the lugs to transmit stress from the chord to the braces and counter-braces. According to his report, &quot;The cast iron angle block at top of second set of braces had the south lug broken off close to the face, and the line of fracture disclosed an air hole extending over one half the entire section. ...[The] failure first began in the south truss, at the second panel point from the west abutment.&quot; The second full angle block &quot;was so far impaired by an air hole as to be reduced in strength fully one half. ... At no other point were these lugs subjected to so great strain, except at the end casting and here they were heavily reinforced.&quot; This &quot;defective detail&quot; caused the collapse of the bridge.

===Conclusions by the railroad===
LS&amp;MS president Amasa Stone categorically denied that there were any design or construction flaws. He initially blamed the bridge&#x27;s collapse on the deraillment of one of the two locomotives pulling the train, or by a loose rail which caused the train&#x27;s deraillment. The railroad also hypothesized that a tornado may have hit the bridge, causing it to come loose from the abutments.

Although the LS&amp;MS refused to accept responsibility for the disaster, it paid out more than $500,000 ($ in dollars) to victims and their families to quiet legal claims.

==Modern engineering analysis of the disaster==
Björn Åkesson, a civil engineer at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, has identified three proximate causes of the bridge collapse: (1) the failure of an angle block lug on the west end of the bridge due to fatigue (caused by bending and shear stress), (2) thrust stress from improperly fitting chords and diagonals, and (3) low temperatures, which caused the cast iron angle blocks to become brittle. The failure of the angle block caused the upper chord to buckle, and the bridge to collapse.

===The angle block===
The angle blocks were made of cast iron, which Åkesson says was appropriate, for the angle blocks were in compression. The vertical lugs atop the angle blocks in the upper chord of the bridge received shear stress, but this should have been minimal as shear stress was only induced by one of the adjacent members of the chord.

The critical issue, Åkesson says, is that the broken lug on the southern angle block atop the joint between the second and third panel had a void. The void itself weakened the integrity of the block. Voids also encourage the formation of large grains and can accumulate impurities like slag, both of which also increase the brittleness of iron. The void also worsened stress on the block through stress concentration effect. Gasparini and Fields conclude that this void, combined with metal fatigue, caused the lug to fail. Metal fatigue was an issue in cast and wrought iron which only a few metallurgists and engineers were aware of in the 19th century. The failure of this lug on this angle block caused the entire bridge to fail.

Neither the joint committee, nor the coroner&#x27;s jury, nor any of the engineers employed by them identified the flaw in the angle block casting.

In retrospect, Gasparini and Fields say, the point where the lug transitioned to the main body of the angle block was extremely problematic. The solidification rates of the molten iron were so different, this was a likely site for the formation of cracks or voids.

===Poor construction caused overwhelming thrust load===
Poor construction of the bridge&#x27;s diagonals worsened the stresses placed on the lugs on the angle blocks. Howe trusses rely on prestressing of braces and counter-braces to improve the way the bridge carries load. Tightening the nuts on the vertical posts (prestressing) puts the verticals in tension (stretches them). If the diagonals are already closely fitted to the angle blocks, prestressing compresses the diagonals. This allows them to carry more load. The Ashtabula Bridge diagonals, however, were only loosely fitted to the angle blocks. Prestressing brought the diagonals into a relatively close fit with the angle blocks, but did not put the diagonals in compression. The problem was worsened because shims were used to fill the space between the diagonal bearings and the angle blocks. The history of the bridge indicates that some of these shims had come loose over time and fallen away. The loss of shims induced uneven loading, as the more tightly connected diagonals absorbed load before the loose ones did. Åkesson points out that the shims themselves may even have created unequal pressure points between I-beams and the lugs, subjecting the lugs to bending forces as well as shear forces. With the diagonals not carrying the load they were intended to carry, extra stress was placed on the chords. Unequal loading of the angle blocks worsened the metal fatigue.

The construction of the upper chord of the bridge was also poor. This chord consisted of five I-beams running in parallel. Having all five members end at panel joints actually weakened a bridge, so Howe trusses were built so that three ended at one panel connection and the other two at the next panel connection. As with the connection between diagonals and angle blocks, it was critical that there be no space between the I-beams and the lugs on top of the angle block because these lugs transferred axial forces to the next member. Space between the member and lug would reduce the effectiveness of this transfer and introduce shear stress to the lug. The problems with camber led to members of the chords being shortened and the lugs being shaved down, actions which introduced space between the lugs and the chord members. Construction workers used metal shims to fill the space between the lug and the chord members until a tight fit was achieved. Friction alone, rather than an active connection such as a yoke or bolt, kept the shims in place. For some years prior to the disaster, locomotive engineers reported hearing &quot;snapping sounds&quot; as their trains crossed the Ashtabula Bridge. This indicates that some shims had come loose and fallen off, reintroducing space between the chord members and angle block vertical lugs. This allowed members of the chord to thrust suddenly against the lugs, inducing even more metal fatigue. There is also an indication in the construction record that several chord members were misaligned. Even if their bearings had been flat, they would not have met the lugs completely. This, too, would have created uneven loading and worsened metal fatigue.

Gasparini and Fields conclude that the bridge might have survived the loss of the lug had the chords and diagonals been made stronger through active continuous connection. Active continuous connection was not used on the bridge: The members of the chords were connected to angle blocks at only every other panel, the five beams making up each chord did not have a continuous interconnection between them, and the none of the parallel I-beams making up the diagonals were continuously interconnected. Åkesson points out that construction errors probably made the diagonals even less effective as thin members were placed where thicker ones should have gone and vice versa. The braces and counter-braces in a Howe truss must be the same size for the truss system to be robust and redundant. Making a brace stronger relative to a counter-brace, for example, actually reduces robustness and redundancy by changing the relative distribution of forces on the diagonals. These errors appreciably lessened the bridge&#x27;s ability to withstand extra loading. Stone&#x27;s strengthening of the bridge after the camber repairs also harmed the bridge&#x27;s capabilities. By adding two I-beams to the end braces, Stone actually reduced the maximum stress the braces in the end panels could bear.

===Low temperature exacerbated the flaw in the lug===
Low temperatures the night of the disaster also worsened the metal fatigue in the already damaged lug. The role that low temperatures played in creating and worsening metal fatigue was also poorly understood in the 19th century. The temperature at the time of the accident was . Cast iron is prone to fracture and fatigue cracks, and Gasparini and Fields suggest that a significant fatigue crack, originating at the void in the lug, existed at the time of the disaster, created by repeated unequal stress over the previous 11 years. The low temperatures on the night of the accident increased the brittleness of the cast iron. An existing fracture worsened in the cold and likely caused the lug&#x27;s failure.

===The issue of poor inspection===
Modern analyzes of the bridge collapse conclude that the railway had inadequately inspected and maintained the bridge. Åkesson, however, says that better inspection of the bridge may not have prevented a collapse. An inverted Howe truss puts the superstructure below the track, where it is difficult to see and inspect, and the angle blocks were hidden by the surrounding I-beams. Better inspection may have corrected some construction errors and identified falling shims, but might not have improved the bridge&#x27;s survivability.

==Legacy==

The legislative joint committee drafted a bill that would have created Ohio&#x27;s first bridge design code, required professional oversight of bridge construction, and mandated expert, frequent, regular inspections by civil engineers. The Ohio state legislature declined to act on the bill.

Concern that the city lacked medical care for the victims of the bridge disaster, citizens of Ashtabula began raising money to build a hospital in their town. An emergency care clinic opened in 1882, followed by Ashtabula General Hospital on July 1, 1904.

Several other changes were also made in the wake of the accident. Because of its low ductility, cast iron was banned by civil engineers for use in load-carrying structures soon after the accident. About 1886, steam heat was adopted by the railroad, replacing the wood and coal stoves in passenger cars. As part of the Interstate Commerce Act, a federal system was set up in 1887 to formally investigate fatal railroad accidents.

Initially, the mass grave of unidentified remains in Chestnut Grove Cemetery was unmarked. Local citizens began an effort to erect a monument on the site in 1892, and the Ashtabula Bridge Disaster Monument was dedicated on May 30, 1895, before a crowd of 5,000 people. The names of 25 individuals known to have died in the fire but whose remains could not be found are listed on a plaque on the memorial&#x27;s base.

The alarm bell from the Lake Street Fire House which was used to call for help on the night of December 29 has also been preserved. It passed into private hands, but was donated to the city of Ashtabula in 1975. It is now on display in front of the city&#x27;s Main Avenue fire station, accompanied by a small plaque.

Letters from concerned friends and families seeking whether loved ones had survived are archived at the Jennie Munger Gregory Memorial Museum at Geneva-on-the-Lake, Ohio.

===Death of Charles Collins===
Days after testifying before the state legislature committee, LS&amp;MS chief engineer Charles Collins was found dead in his bedroom of a gunshot wound to the head. Having tendered his resignation to the railroad&#x27;s board of directors the previous Monday and been refused, Collins was believed to have committed suicide out of grief and feeling partially responsible for the tragic accident.

Two official autopsies, both conducted in 1878, concluded that Collins had been murdered. For unknown reasons, law enforcement officials did not release these reports at the time. The reports were rediscovered in 2001.

Collins was buried in an elaborate mausoleum at Chestnut Grove Cemetery.

<text>Bartolomeo Barbarino (known as &quot;il Pesarino&quot;) (c. 1568c. 1617 or later) was an Italian composer and singer of the early Baroque era. He was a virtuoso falsettist, and one of the most enthusiastic composers of the new style of monody.

==Life==
Nothing is known about his early life; his birthdate is inferred from the description by an English visitor in 1608 who described him as being &quot;about forty.&quot; The first record concerning him is from 1593, when he was employed as an alto in Loreto at Santa Casa. Until 1602 he was in Urbino, where he served both Monsignor Giuliano della Rovere and the Duke of Urbino. From 1602 to 1605 he worked as organist at Pesaro Cathedral, and afterwards worked in Padua for the Bishop of Padua. In 1608 he went to Venice to take part in the Festival of San Rocco. Evidently his fame as a singer was widespread at this time, as he was one of the most distinguished visitors.

An English visitor to Venice, Thomas Coryat, left this description of his singing (&quot;Coryats Crudities&quot;, London, 1611):

:&quot;Of the singers there were three or foure so excellent that I thinke few or none in Christendome do exell them, especially one, who had such a peerelesse and ... supernaturall voice for sweetnesse, that I thinke there was never a better singer in the world ... I alwaies thought that he was an Eunuch, which if he had beene, it had taken away some part of my admiration, because they do most commonly sing passing wel; but he was not, therefore it was much the more admirable.&quot;

In the preface to one of his books of motets, Barbarino wrote that he would sing his works to the accompaniment of the chitarrone, &quot;for my voice is hoarse and frail.&quot;

==Works==
Almost all of Barbarino&#x27;s music is in the monodic style, using a single virtuoso solo voice part accompanied by basso continuo. Unusually for the time, he often indicated the instruments which were best to use as accompaniment, including chitarrone, theorbo, and harpsichord. His last collection of works, a book of madrigals dated to 1617, is for three voices, but also accompanied by basso continuo.

Barbarino published two books of motets, both in Venice, as well as thirteen separate sacred pieces; additionally he published five books of madrigals and one book of &quot;canzonette,&quot; for a total of over 150 pieces. He often published two separate versions of the solo voice part for each work: one heavily ornamented and extremely difficult to sing (most likely he sang this version himself); and a simplified version intended for a less accomplished singer.

<text>The AN-11 was France&#x27;s first nuclear weapon, developed to arm the Force de frappe.

The AN-11&#x27;s development began in the late 1950s. An early version was used in France&#x27;s first nuclear test, Gerboise Bleue, on 13 February 1960. The first AN-11 prototype was tested 1 May 1962, and it entered service in 1964.

The AN-11 was a pure fission weapon, a plutonium implosion type. It weighed approximately 1,500 kg (3,306 lb). It was a free-fall bomb intended to be dropped from high-altitude bombers. The explosive nuclear weapon yield was about 60 kt.

About 40 AN-11s were produced between 1963 and 1968. The carrier was the Dassault Mirage IV, although some reports said the Sud Aviation Vautour could also carry this bomb. Beginning in 1967 it was replaced by the more advanced AN-22 bomb.</text><links>

<text>Berkner Island (also known as the Berkner Ice Rise or as Hubley Island) is an Antarctic ice rise, where bedrock below sea level has caused the surrounding ice sheet to create a dome. If the ice cap were removed, the island would be underwater. Berkner Island is completely ice-covered and is about long and wide, with an area of . It is surrounded by the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. The northernmost point of the Berkner is about from the open sea. It lies in the overlapping portion of the Argentine and the British Antarctic territorial claims.

The island rises to (, according to other sources) and separates the Ronne Ice Shelf from the Filchner Ice Shelf. It is characterized by two domes, &quot;Reinwarthhöhe&quot; in the north (), and &quot;Thyssenhöhe&quot; in the south (). It is indented by three bays on the eastern side, which are, from north to south, the McCarthy Inlet, the Roberts Inlet, and the Spilhaus Inlet. The southern tip is named the Mulvaney Promontory. Gould Bay is on the north coast. Berkner Island is about west of Luitpold Coast, Coats Land, the closest mainland of Eastern Antarctica. The Hemmen Ice Rise is off the northwest corner of Berkner Island.

==History==
Berkner Island was discovered by members of the United States-International Geophysical Year party from Ellsworth Station during the 1957–1958 season. It was named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names after American physicist Lloyd Berkner, engineer with the Byrd Antarctic Expedition (1928–1930).

Since 1990, Berkner Island has been a jumping-off point for a number of long-distance polar expeditions. Ben Saunders has planned an unsupported journey from the island to the South Pole and back, and it was the start point of Henry Worsley&#x27;s attempt to cross the Antarctic in 2015–16.

In the 1994–1995 field season, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Alfred Wegener Institute and the Forschungsstelle für Physikalische Glaziologie of the University of Münster cooperated in a project drilling ice cores on the North (&quot;Reinwarthhöhe&quot;) and South (&quot;Thyssenhöhe&quot;) Domes of the island. Between 2002 and 2005 a core was drilled through to the bed at &quot;Thyssenhöhe&quot; by a team from BAS and the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Géophysique de l’Environnement, Grenoble, and radar work in 2005 and 2010-11 confirmed the existence of the Raymond Effect.

==Important Bird Area==
A 500 ha site on fast ice north of the area where the Ronne Ice Shelf joins the north-western coast of Berkner Island, about to the northwest of Gould Bay, has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports an emperor penguin colony. The size of the colony was estimated as about 8,000 individual birds, based on 2009 satellite imagery.

<text>James Butler Jr. (born December 18, 1972) is an American convicted murderer and former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2004. He challenged once for the IBF super middleweight title in 2000, but he is best known for his infamous bout on November 23, 2001 against Richard Grant where he was arrested after the fight for assault. In 2004, Butler was arrested for the murder of Sam Kellerman and was sentenced to 29 years and four months in prison.

== Biography ==
Butler started off his career by scoring 18 wins and only 1 loss in the super middleweight division. This led to a title fight against Sven Ottke who beat Butler by unanimous decision.

Butler&#x27;s next bout earned him infamy. On November 23, 2001, Butler took on Richard Grant on a special edition of ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot;, which emanated from the Roseland Ballroom in New York City and was part of a charity event designed to raise money to help assist New York police and fire department personnel that survived the September 11 attacks. The two had met earlier in their careers, fighting in 1996 when they were first starting out as professionals, with Grant winning a four-round decision. The fight was scheduled for ten rounds and went the distances, with all three judges scoring the bout for Grant. 

As the two men waited for the results, Butler asked for his gloves to be cut off. After Grant was announced the winner, Butler stood in his corner seeming unpleased by the decision. Grant then made his way over to Butler to congratulate him for his effort, but Butler sucker punched the unsuspecting Grant with a right hook that dropped him to the floor. Grant lay dazed on the ring mat and bleeding from the mouth while broadcasters Bob Papa and Teddy Atlas called out for Butler to be arrested on assault charges. Grant suffered a dislocated jaw and lacerated tongue from the unprotected bare knuckle punch, and Butler was eventually convicted of assaulting Grant and spent four months in Rikers Island.

After Butler&#x27;s assault, he would not return to boxing for three years. Returning as a light heavyweight, he fought four times and lost twice. His last fight was on another ESPN card against former super middleweight contender Omar Sheika, which he lost by split decision on August 10, 2004. 

== Killing of Sam Kellerman ==

On October 12, 2004, writer Sam Kellerman (brother of sports analyst Max Kellerman) was killed at his apartment in Los Angeles. His body was not found until October 17. Butler was considered a suspect since he had been friends with Kellerman for over 10 years.

On October 20, Butler, accompanied by a lawyer, sought treatment for his alleged bipolar disorder.

Butler was arrested for the Kellerman murder on October 27. Two days later, he pleaded not guilty to murder and arson. He was held on $1.25 million bail. Prosecutors claimed that Butler, the only suspect in the case, repeatedly struck Kellerman in the head with a hammer, then torched Kellerman&#x27;s Hollywood, California apartment in an attempted cover-up.

On July 8, 2005, a Los Angeles judge ruled there was sufficient evidence for Butler to stand trial on charges of murder and arson.

On March 27, 2006, Butler pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and arson in the 2004 death of Kellerman. On April 5, Butler was sentenced to 29 years and four months in prison by Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor, according to Deputy Public Defender Jack Keenan.

Prosecutors speculated Butler was having relationship issues with his girlfriend while also struggling to revive his boxing career when Kellerman asked Butler to move out. A disagreement ensued on how long Butler could stay when he picked up a hammer and killed Kellerman, then torched his house.

<text>The AN-22 was France&#x27;s second air-dropped nuclear weapon, developed as a replacement for the earlier AN-11 bomb, entering service in 1967. It had a similar 60 to 70 kilotons yield fission warhead to the earlier AN-11, but with enhanced safety features and a parachute retarder to enable it to be dropped at low level. Additionally the casing was redesigned reducing its weight from approximately 1,400 kg (3,000 lb) to around 700 kg (1,500 lb). One bomb could be mounted in the bomb layer of the fuselage of Mirage IVA, which was mainly produced in the early stages.

A stockpile of about 40 weapons was maintained, providing one for each of the 36 Mirage IVAs in service, plus several spares. The last warhead was retired on 1 July 1988, at which point the ASMP standoff missile took over the role previously held by the AN-22.

<text>The SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library () is the national library of Bulgaria, situated in the capital city of Sofia. Founded on 4 April 1878, the library received the status of Bulgarian National Library three years later and the Bulgarian National Revival Archive was merged into it in 1924.

It is named after &quot;SS. Cyril and Methodius&quot;; Saints Cyril and Methodius. They are the creators of the Glagolitic alphabet. The Cyrillic alphabet is named after Cyril.

The present building of the library is among the landmarks of Sofia. It was designed by the famous Bulgarian architectural team Vasilyov-Dimitur Tsolov and completed in the period 1940–1953.

==History==

The SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library is currently the largest public library in Bulgaria and the oldest cultural institution after the country&#x27;s liberation, and also houses one of the richest Ottoman archival collections.

In 1878, Mikhail Bobotinov, a teacher and secretary of the City Council in Sofia, proposed to establish a public library for the need of cultural and educational development in Sofia. The library was then arranged and open in 1878 and finally received its own building in 1900. In 1939, a new building began construction, but sadly in 1944 both the new and old building were destroyed during a bombing in Sofia. In 1953, the National Library opens its new building under the name &quot;Vasil Kolarov&quot;. It was not until 1963 that the library was renamed from &quot;Vasil Kolarov&quot; to &quot;St. Cyril and Methodius&quot;.

== Notable collections ==

The main aims of SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library since its establishment was to collect manuscripts, old printed books, and all books in Bulgarian language or by Bulgarian authors written in a foreign language. Later a fund of Slavic and foreign language manuscripts was formed. Among the first entries were the rich personal libraries of the historian Prof. Marin Drinov and the poet Petko Slaveikov, as well as collections from different churches and monasteries. Two collections were formed in the National Library – consisting of Bulgarian and of Oriental documents respectively. Since its very beginning, the institution acquired the character of historical archives. 
* Slavonic Scriptures, a collection of more than 1,700 originals dating from the 11th to the 19th centuries.
* Greek and other Foreign Scriptures with around 200 monuments, 9th to 19th century.
* Eastern Scriptures, containing around 3,100 Arabic, 500 Ottoman, and 150 Persian codicies, dated 11th to the 19th centuries.
* Various archives of Ottoman, Arabic, and Persian documents, catalogued under the Collection of Oriental Archives and the Newer Turkish Archives and 328 separate funds, each sorted by geographical criteria, covering a period from the 15th until the first quarter of the 20th century. Both collections contain over 500,000 units, 714 registers (&quot;defters&quot;) and 168 &quot;sidjals&quot;.
* Old Print, Rares and Valuables, a collection of about 30,000 volumes in Old Church Slavonic, Bulgarian and foreign languages, covering a period from the 15th until the 20th century, plus a collection of Bulgarian Renaissance press from the period before 1878.
* Old Print Books from the Orient, a collection of around 2,000 volumes in Arabic, Turkish and Persian, covering a period from 1593 to the first quarter of the 20th century.
* Bulgarian Historical Archive with over 1.5 million documents under 700 separate archives covering the work of Bulgarian revolutionaries, economic, cultural and public people from the 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, as well as the history of the independence struggle in Macedonia and Eastern Thrace (see History of Bulgaria).
* Portraits and Photographs, a collection of over 80,000 photographs and illustrations.

<doc id="1121555" wikidata="Q935398" url="?curid=1121555" title="Calixto García">
<text>Calixto García Íñiguez (August 4, 1839 – December 11, 1898) was a Cuban general in three Cuban uprisings, part of the Cuban War for Independence: the Ten Years&#x27; War, the Little War, and the War of 1895, itself sometimes called the Cuban War for Independence, which initiated the Spanish–American War, ultimately resulting in national independence for Cuba.

==Ancestry and progeny==
García was born in Holguín to parents of Cuban &quot;Criollo&quot; descent. He was a large, strong, educated man with a short temper. García was the grandson of Calixto García de Luna e Izquierdo, who had fought as a royalist in the Battle of Carabobo in 1821 during the Venezuelan War of Independence. His grandmother was Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez, said to be the daughter of a &quot;cacique&quot; from Valencia, Venezuela. His grandfather (who had dropped the aristocratic &quot;de Luna&quot; upon taking refuge in Cuba) had been jailed on March 18, 1837, for demanding emancipation of slaves, constitutional freedom for all, and allegedly trying to hang a priest who opposed him. As befitted a man of importance of that time, Calixto had a wife, Isabel Velez Cabrera, and a good number of mistresses; these women gave birth to many children both legitimate (about 7) and illegitimate (at least six, each to a different woman). A number of his sons, most notably Carlos García Vélez and Calixto Enamorado, fought in his armies.

==War record==
Around the age of 28, García joined with a Cuban uprising which became the first war of independence (Ten Years&#x27; War). García fought against Spanish colonial rule for five years until his capture. Far from most of his troops, protected only by a small group who soon lay dead or dying around him, Garcia, in an attempt to avoid giving the Spanish the satisfaction of seizing him, shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived; the wound left a great scar and gave him headaches for the rest of his life. 

He was imprisoned until the Pact of Zanjón ending the Ten Years&#x27; War was signed in 1878. García travelled to Paris and New York between imprisonments. In keeping to his quest, García joined with Antonio Maceo Grajales in the Little War from 1879 to 1880 as well as the 1895 War for Independence. He, and at least three sons, separately escaped from Spain and arrived with a well-supplied expedition in 1896. In that last conflict he succeeded Maceo, once his subordinate in the Ten Years&#x27; War, as the second in command in the Cuban Army.

Garcia had a long string of victories in this war, which included the taking of Tunas and Guisa, and the emotionally significant re-occupation of Bayamo. García made liberal use of spies to prepare for his attacks. These included Dominador de la Guardia father of Ángel de la Guardia and María Machado, illegitimate daughter of Spanish General Emilio March who helped prepare the taking of Tunas; Frederick Funston later US Major General and José Martí y Zayas Bazán son of José Martí the major Cuban National Hero directed artillery; Mario García Menocal a to-be president of Cuba who was wounded in a principal assault. Angel de la Guardia, also a major Cuban national hero, died in this battle on August 30, 1897.

At the time of the U.S. landings, García, with skilled use of mobile artillery, controlled the interior of old Oriente Province, and prepared the landing places for the U.S. Army near Santiago. His troops effectively supported the Marine forces at Guantanamo who, once out of range of the guns of the , had difficulty dealing with Spanish guerrilla tactics. He was the general who dealt with the American troops and joined them in military actions, only to be denied entrance into Santiago de Cuba when the Spanish surrendered.

==Death==
García died of pneumonia at the age of 59 on December 11, 1898, one day after the end of the Spanish–American War, while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. He was buried temporarily in Arlington National Cemetery in the U.S., then transported on the heavily armed seagoing warship to Cuba. His final burial in Havana, Cuba, was preceded by a number of emotional incidents, and his statues and busts are found throughout Cuba. A major statue is found on the Malecón near the US Interests Section in Havana. After his death, a large bronze tablet prominently inscribed with the phrase &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot; was erected by the Freemasons at the place of his demise—the Raleigh Hotel in Washington, D.C. Today, this tablet resides at the private residence of one of García&#x27;s direct descendants.
The essay &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot; by Elbert Hubbard was written in reference by U.S. intelligence officer Andrew Summers Rowan to establish contact with García early in the Spanish–American War. It was historically-inaccurate; Rowan had been instructed to join Garcia but actually returned promptly to the United States to find that the essay had already made him a popular hero. According to language expert Charles Earle Funk, &quot;to take a message to García&quot;, meaning to accept an extremely difficult challenge, was a popular U.S. slang expression for years. The essay was made into two American films, the 1916 silent &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot; with García played by Charles Sutton and the 1936 film &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot; featuring Enrique Acosta.

In 1976, a municipality in Holguín Province was named Calixto García after him. His portrait is on the 50 Cuban peso banknote.

<doc id="1121556" wikidata="Q776909" url="?curid=1121556" title="Larsen Ice Shelf">
<text>The Larsen Ice Shelf is a long ice shelf in the northwest part of the Weddell Sea, extending along the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula from Cape Longing to Smith Peninsula. It is named after Captain Carl Anton Larsen, the master of the Norwegian whaling vessel &quot;Jason&quot;, who sailed along the ice front as far as 68°10&#x27; South during December 1893. In finer detail, the Larsen Ice Shelf is a series of shelves that occupy (or occupied) distinct embayments along the coast. From north to south, the segments are called Larsen A (the smallest), Larsen B, and Larsen C (the largest) by researchers who work in the area. Further south, Larsen D and the much smaller Larsen E, F and G are also named.

The breakup of the ice shelf since the mid-1990s has been widely reported, with the collapse of Larsen B in 2002 being particularly dramatic. A large section of the Larsen C shelf broke away in July 2017 to form an iceberg known as A-68.

The ice shelf originally covered an area of , but following the disintegration in the north and the calving of iceberg A-68, it now covers an area of .

==Research==

The collapse of Larsen B has revealed a thriving chemotrophic ecosystem 800 m (half a mile) below the sea. The discovery was accidental. U.S. Antarctic Program scientists were in the north-western Weddell Sea investigating the sediment record in a deep glacial trough of roughly (twice the size of Texas or France). Methane and hydrogen sulfide associated with cold seeps is suspected as the source of the chemical energy powering the ecosystem. The area had been protected by the overlying ice shelf from debris and sediment which was seen to be building up on the white microbial mats after the breakup of the ice shelf. Clams were observed clustered about the vents.
The former Larsen A region, which was the farthest north and was just outside the Antarctic Circle, had previously broken up in the middle of the present interglacial and reformed only about 4,000 years ago. The former Larsen B, by contrast, had been stable for at least 10,000 years. The ice of the shelf is renewed on a much shorter time-scale and the oldest ice on the current shelf dates from only two hundred years ago. The speed of Crane Glacier increased threefold after the collapse of the Larsen B, likely due to the removal of a buttressing effect of the ice shelf. Data collected in 2007 by an international team of investigators through satellite-based radar measurements suggests that the overall ice-sheet mass balance in Antarctica is increasingly negative.

== Breakup ==

The Larsen disintegration events were unusual by past standards. Typically, ice shelves lose mass by iceberg calving and by melting at their upper and lower surfaces. The disintegration events were linked by &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in 2005 to ongoing climate warming in the Antarctic Peninsula, about 0.5˚C (0.9˚F) per decade since the late 1940s. According to a paper published in &quot;Journal of Climate&quot; in 2006, the peninsula at Faraday station warmed by 2.94˚C (5.3˚F) from 1951 to 2004, much faster than Antarctica as a whole and faster than the global trend; anthropogenic global warming causes this localized warming through a strengthening of the winds circling the Antarctic.

=== Larsen A ===

The Larsen A ice shelf disintegrated in January 1995. It was an ice shelf near the Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, extending from Cape Longing to Robertson Island, and merged with Larsen B at Seal Nunataks. It was relatively stable and around 4000 km^2 from 1961, until around the 1980s, when large calving resulted in eventual collapse. 
=== Larsen B ===

From 31 January 2002 to March 2002 the Larsen B sector partially collapsed and parts broke up, of ice thick, an area comparable to the US state of Rhode Island. In 2015, a study concluded that the remaining Larsen B ice-shelf would disintegrate by 2020, based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area.

Larsen B was stable for at least 10,000 years, essentially the entire Holocene period since the last glacial period. By contrast, Larsen A was absent for a significant part of that period, reforming about 4,000 years ago.

Despite its great age, the Larsen B was clearly in trouble at the time of the collapse. With warm currents eating away the underside of the shelf, it had become a &quot;hotspot of global warming&quot;. It broke over a period of three weeks or less, with a factor in this fast break-up being the powerful effects of water; ponds of meltwater formed on the surface during the near 24 hours of daylight in the summertime, flowed down into cracks and, acting like a multitude of wedges, levered the shelf apart. Other likely factors in the break-up were the higher ocean temperatures and the decline of the ice of the peninsula.

In the austral winter of 2011, a large expanse of sea ice formed over the embayment that was once covered by the land-fast shelf of fresh-water glacial ice of Larsen B. This enormous ice pack persisted through January 2022 when it suddenly broke-up over the course of a few days, &quot;taking with it a Philadelphia-sized piece of the Scar Inlet Ice Shelf,&quot; according to NASA scientists examining images from the Terra and Aqua satellites.

=== Larsen C ===


, Larsen C was the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with an area of about .

Satellite radar altimeter measurements show that between 1992 and 2001, the Larsen Ice Shelf thinned by up to 0.27 ± 0.11 meters per year. In 2004, a report concluded that although the remaining Larsen C region appeared to be relatively stable, continued warming could lead to its breakup within the following decade.

The breakaway process for the iceberg had begun by mid-2016. On 10 November 2016 scientists photographed the growing rift running along the Larsen C ice shelf, showing it running about long with a width of more than , and a depth of . By December 2016, the rift had extended another to the point where only of unbroken ice remained and calving was considered to be a certainty in 2017. This was predicted to cause the calving of between nine and twelve percent of the ice shelf, , an area greater than the US state of Delaware, or twice the size of Luxembourg. The calved fragment was predicted to be thick and to have an area of about . The resulting iceberg was predicted to be among the largest icebergs ever recorded, unless it would break into multiple pieces.

On 1 May 2017 members of MIDAS reported that satellite images showed a new crack, around long, branching off the main crack approximately behind the previous tip, heading toward the ice front. Scientists with Swansea University in the UK say the crack lengthened from 25 May to 31 May, and that less than of ice is all that prevents the birth of an enormous iceberg. &quot;The rift tip appears also to have turned significantly towards the ice front, indicating that the time of calving is probably very close,&quot; Adrian Luckman and Martin O&#x27;Leary wrote on Wednesday in a blog post for the Impact of Melt on Ice Shelf Dynamics and Stability project, or MIDAS. &quot;There appears to be very little to prevent the iceberg from breaking away completely.&quot; The larger swath of the Larsen C ice shelf that sat behind the calved iceberg &quot;will be less stable than it was prior to the rift&quot; and may rapidly disintegrate in the same manner as Larsen B did in 2002.

In June 2017 the speed of the imminent Larsen C iceberg accelerated, with the eastern end moving at per day away from the main shelf. As discussed by the Project MIDAS researchers on their site: &quot;In another sign that the iceberg calving is imminent, the soon-to-be-iceberg part of Larsen C ice shelf has tripled in speed to more than 10 meters per day between 24 and 27 June 2017. The iceberg remains attached to the ice shelf, but its outer end is moving at the highest speed ever recorded on this ice shelf.&quot;

On 7 July the Project MIDAS blog report stated: &quot;The latest data from 6th July reveal that, in a release of built-up stresses, the rift branched several times. Using data from ESA&#x27;s Sentinel-1 satellites, we can see that there are multiple rift tips now within 5 km (3.10 miles) of the ice edge. We expect that these rifts will lead to the formation of several smaller icebergs.&quot;

On 12 July 2017, Project MIDAS announced that a large, portion of Larsen C had broken from the main ice shelf at some point between 10 and 12 July. The iceberg, designated A-68, weighs more than a trillion tons and is more than thick. 

Project MIDAS updated their blog information on 19 July 2017 regarding Larsen C by revealing that a possible new rift appeared to be extending northwards from the point where A-68 had broken off in mid-July. The project researchers felt this questionable new rift might turn towards the shelf edge, compounding the risk that it would &quot;continue on to Bawden ice rise&quot; which is considered &quot;a crucial point of stabilization for Larsen C Ice Shelf.&quot; 

As is true of all floating ice shelves, A68&#x27;s departure from Antarctica had no immediate effect on global sea levels. However, a number of glaciers discharge onto the shelf from the land behind it, and they may now flow faster due to reduced support from the ice shelf. If all the ice that the Larsen C shelf currently holds back were to enter the sea, global waters would rise by an estimated .

=== Larsen D ===
The Larsen D Ice Shelf is between Smith Peninsula in the south and Gipps Ice Rise. It is considered to be generally stable. Over roughly the past fifty years it has advanced (expanded) whereas comparable George VI, Bach, Stange, and Larsen C ice shelves have retreated (to a much greater net extent). The most recent survey of Larsen D measured it at 22,600 km2. There is fast ice along the entire front. This makes it difficult to interpret the ice front because the semi-permanent sea ice varies in thickness and may be nearly indistinguishable from shelf ice.

<text>Eosinophilic (Greek suffix -phil-, meaning &quot;loves eosin&quot;) is the staining of tissues, cells, or organelles after they have been washed with eosin, a dye.

Eosin is an acidic dye for staining cell cytoplasm, collagen, and muscle fibers. &quot;Eosinophilic&quot; describes the appearance of cells and structures seen in histological sections that take up the staining dye eosin. Such eosinophilic structures are, in general, composed of protein.

Eosin is usually combined with a stain called hematoxylin to produce a hematoxylin- and eosin-stained section (also called an H&amp;E stain, HE or H+E section). It is the most widely used histological stain for a medical diagnosis. When a pathologist examines a biopsy of a suspected cancer, they will stain the biopsy with H&amp;E.

Some structures seen inside cells are described as being eosinophilic; for example, Lewy and Mallory bodies.
Some cells are also described as eosinophilic, such as Leukocytes.

<text>Mosherville is an unincorporated community in Hillsdale County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Scipio Township.

As an unincorporated community, Mosherville has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 49258 ZIP Code, which is primarily used for post office box services.

==Geography== 

Mosherville is located in northern Scipio Township in north-central Hillsdale County about southeast of Coldwater.

Mosherville is located about south of the county line with Jackson County. The rural community is not served by any major highways or airports. Nearby cities include Litchfield to the west and Jonesville to the south. The village of Hanover is located to the northeast. Other nearby unincorporated communities include Pulaski to the north, Stoney Point to the northeast, and Moscow to the east.

Mosherville Lake is the largest lake within the community, and there are several smaller unnamed lakes nearby. The south branch of the Kalamazoo River flows directly through the community. The new Scipio Township Hall is located within Mosherville at 11180 Concord Road just east of the center of the community. The community is served by Jonesville Community Schools to the south in the city of Jonesville.

The Mosherville post office is located at 11200 Winfield Road in the center of the community. The post office uses the 49258 ZIP Code, which is primarily used for post office box services. For delivery, the surrounded area is served by the Jonesville post office, which uses the 49250 ZIP Code.

==History==

This northern area of Scipio Township was first settled as early as 1838 by New York native David Mosher. His brothers Charles, James, and Giles would also later move to the area. David returned to New York, while his brothers remained and built a sawmill and grist mill. A post office first opened on July 2, 1849 and was named Scipio after the township. Samuel E. Smith served as the first postmaster. The community was platted in 1852 and later expanded in 1856, and the post office was briefly renamed Tylerville. The community appeared under the name Mosherville on an 1857 map of Hillsdale County, and the post office was ultimately renamed Mosherville on April 20, 1858. 

In 1899, the Omega Portland Cement Company began operating in Mosherville along Cobb Lake, which is located just southeast of the community. The numerous small lakes in the area were rich in sediments necessary to produce Portland cement, and the company built several buildings in Mosherville. The sediments were dredged from the nearby lakes and transported to Millbury, Ohio for further processing. This company ceased operation in 1914.

Mosherville once had a train station along the Fort Wayne and Jackson Railroad branch of the New York Central Railroad. The station operated as late as 1923, but the station and train tracks are no longer present in Mosherville. East Mosherville was another community settled just to the east and also had its own train station. This community appeared on an 1872 and 1911 maps of Hillsdale County. While Mosherville continues to exist as an unincorporated community, East Mosherville has effectively become a ghost town.

===Mosherville Church and School Complex===
The most notable historic structures within the community are the Mosherville Church and Mosherville School. They were designated a Michigan State Historic Site as the Mosherville Church and School Complex on April 24, 1979. The next year, the state erected a dual-sized historic marker describing the two structures.

The church is located at 1520 North Street and was originally constructed from 1861–1862 on land donated by Joseph and Mary Riggs. The church was a Litchfield branch that served as a Methodist Episcopal Church, and it began operating independently in 1870. In 1891, the church was also used by the Ladies&#x27; Aid Society, which expanded the church. The Mosherville Church remains in operation and holds weekly non-denominational services.

The Mosherville School began operating in 1847 and built its first school in 1857–1858. In 1872, the current structure was built next to the church at a cost of $2,800. As the oldest school in Scipio Township, it served as a two-room schoolhouse that taught students in grades one through ten. Later serving as only an eighth grade school, it closed in 1967. Afterward, it was used by the Ladies&#x27; Aid Society and currently serves as a fellowship hall with the Mosherville Church.

<doc id="1121564" wikidata="Q43076469" url="?curid=1121564" title="Piston valve">
<text>A piston valve is a device used to control the motion of a fluid or gas along a tube or pipe by means of the linear motion of a piston within a chamber or cylinder.

Examples of piston valves are:
* The valves used in many brass instruments
* The valves used for pneumatic propulsion
* The valves used in many stationary steam engines and steam locomotives

==Brass instruments==

 Cylindrical piston valves called Périnet valves (after their inventor François Périnet) are used to change the length of tube in the playing of most brass instruments, particularly the trumpet-like members of the family (cornet, flugelhorn, saxhorn, etc.).

Other brass instruments use rotary valves, notably the orchestral horns and many tuba models, but also a number of rotary-valved variants of those brass instruments which more commonly employ piston valves.

The first piston-valved musical instruments were developed just after the start of the 19th century. The Stölzel valve (invented by Heinrich Stölzel in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the Vienna valve was an improved design. However most professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured towards the end of the 19th century.

==Pneumatic cannon==
A piston valve can also refer to a 2-way 2-position, pilot-operated spool valve. The term is extremely popular among spud gun enthusiasts who often build homemade piston valves for use in pneumatic cannon. Valves are typically constructed primarily from pipe fittings and machined plastics or metals.
The inside of a piston valve contains a piston that blocks the output when the valve is pressurized, and a volume of air behind the piston. When the pressure behind the piston is released the piston is pushed back by the force of the pressure from the input. This allows the valve to be opened by a much smaller pilot valve, with speeds faster than possible with just a manually operated valve. Functionally these types of valves are comparable to quick exhaust valves.

This type of piston valve is also sometimes referred to as a back-pressure valve.

<text>Basophilic is a technical term used by pathologists. It describes the appearance of cells, tissues and cellular structures as seen through the microscope after a histological section has been stained with a basic dye. The most common such dye is haematoxylin.

The name basophilic refers to the characteristic of these structures to be stained very well by basic dyes. This can be explained by their charges. Basic dyes are cationic, i.e. contain positive charges, and thus they stain anionic structures (i.e. structures containing negative charges), such as the phosphate backbone of DNA in the cell nucleus and ribosomes.

&quot;Basophils&quot; are cells that &quot;love&quot; (from greek &quot;-phil&quot;) basic dyes, for example haematoxylin, azure and methylene blue. Specifically, this term refers to:

* basophil granulocytes
* anterior pituitary basophils

An abnormal increase in basophil granulocytes is therefore also described as basophilia.

The opposite of basophilic structures are acidophilic structures, also called eosinophilic. These structures contain many positive charges and are thus strongly stained by anionic dyes like eosin. A typical combination of basophilic and eosinophilic dyes is the H&amp;E stain, which visualizes basophilic structures in blue and eosinophilic structures in red.

<text>A rotary valve (also called rotary-motion valve) is a type of valve in which the rotation of a passage or passages in a transverse plug regulates the flow of liquid or gas through the attached pipes. The common stopcock is the simplest form of rotary valve. Rotary valves have been applied in numerous applications, including:

* Changing the pitch of brass instruments.
* Controlling the steam and exhaust ports of steam engines, most notably in the Corliss steam engine.
* Periodically reversing the flow of air and fuel across the open hearth furnace.
* Loading sample on chromatography columns.
* Certain types of two-stroke and four-stroke engines.
* Most hydraulic automotive power steering control valves.

==Use in brass instruments==

In the context of brass instruments, rotary valves are found on horns, trumpets, trombones, flugelhorns, and tubas. The cornet derived from the posthorn, by applying rotary valves to it in the 1820s in France. An alternative to a rotary valve trumpet would be piston valve trumpet. Many European trumpet players tend to favor rotary valves.

Trombone F attachment valves are usually rotary, with several variations on the basic design also in use, such as the Thayer axial flow valve and the Hagmann valve.

Rotary valve was first applied to the horn in 1824 by Nathan Adams (1783–1864) of Boston and patented in 1835 by Joseph Riedl.

==Use in industry==
Rotary valves for industrial manufacturing are often used in bulk material handling, dust collection or pneumatic conveying systems, depending on the application. The valve is used to regulate the flow of a product or material by maintaining a consistent flow rate suited to the process. Controlling the flow of material helps to prevent issues such as jamming, material leakage and damage to the valve itself. Typical applications are for feeding a weighed hopper or for feeding a mill that can be clogged by the product.

Valves are part of the material exchange process and work in metering or feeding applications, function as rotary airlocks, or provide a combination of airlock and metering functions.

A rotary valve in the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industry is used to dose and feed solid bulk products within the processes. Valves are also commonly used in construction, plastics, recycling, agriculture and forestry, or wherever material needs to be safely and efficiently conveyed from one point to another.

An airlock-type rotary valve receives and dispenses material from two chambers with different pressure levels. They seal air flow between the valve’s inlet and outlet to maintain a consistent pressure differential, which promotes efficient material flow. The valve’s pressurized chamber prevents foreign material from infiltrating the housing and keeps conveyed material from escaping the system.

==Use in engine design==
===Four-stroke engines===


The general adoption of rotary valves in the place of poppet valves in combustion engines was prevented by the issue of sealing. Poppet valves have a seal around the tapered flange of the opening, and this seal improves with increased working pressure in the combustion chamber because the pressure forces the valve shut. In contrast, rotary valves have to move freely to operate and need to be lubricated with oil, causing issues with holding pressures of up to 100 barg at temperatures of 1000 degrees Celsius, with the related thermal expansion of the various seals and valve barrel. This valve expansion causes misalignment in the valve-to-seal interface as an engine moves from room temperature to full operating temperature. If the seals are pressed against the valve with higher pressure to accommodate this expansion, high friction and power loss occurs, plus high rates of wear.

The rotary valve combustion engine possesses several significant advantages over the conventional assemblies, including significantly higher compression ratios and rpm, meaning more power, a much more compact and light-weight cylinder head, and reduced complexity, meaning higher reliability and lower cost. As inlet and exhaust are usually combined, special attention should be given to valve cooling to avoid engine knocking.

Rotary valves have been used in several different engine designs. In Britain, the &quot;National Engine Company Ltd&quot; advertised its rotary valve engine for use in early aircraft, at a time when poppet valves were prone to failure by sticking or burning.

In the end of 1930s, Frank Aspin developed a design with a rotary valve that rotated on the same axis as the cylinder bore, but with limited success.

US company &quot;Coates International Ltd&quot; has developed a spherical rotary valve for internal combustion engines which replaces the poppet valve system. This particular design is four-stroke, with the rotary valves operated by overhead shafts in lieu of overhead camshafts (i.e. in line with a bank of cylinders). The first sale of such an engine was part of a natural gas engine-generator.

Rotary valves are potentially highly suitable for high-revving engines, such as those used in racing sportscars and F1 racing cars, on which traditional poppet valves with springs can fail due to valve float and spring resonance and where the desmodromic valve gear is too heavy, large in size and too complex to time and design properly. Rotary valves could allow for a more compact and lightweight cylinder head design. They rotate at half engine speed (or one quarter) and lack the inertia forces of reciprocating valve mechanisms. This allows for higher engine speeds, offering approximately perhaps 10% more power. The 1980s MGN W12 F1 engine used rotary valves but never raced. Between 2002 and 2004 the Australian developer &quot;Bishop Innovation&quot; and Mercedes-Ilmor tested rotary valves for a F1 V10 engine.

Bishop Innovations&#x27; patent for the rotary valve engine was bought out by BRV Pty Ltd, owned by Tony Wallis, one of the valves original designers. BRV has constructed several functional motors using the rotary valve technology, such as a Honda CRF 450, which had greater torque at both low(17% increase) and high (9% increase) engine speeds, and also produced more brake horsepower up to around 30% more at functional engine speeds. The engine was also considerably smaller and lighter, as the cylinder head assembly was not as large.

A company in the UK called Roton Engine Developments made some progress in 2005 with a two-rotor (one for inlet and one for exhaust) single-cylinder Husaberg motorcycle engine. They filed patents and got an example running in 2006, but were backed by MG Rover which subsequently went bust, leaving Roton without enough funds to continue. The designs surfaced some years later in Australia with Engine Developments Australia Pty Ltd. A prototype casting was produced in 2013 on a Kawasaki Ninja 300 parallel twin unit. This unit is still in development phase at the time of writing but is significant as it has the potential to run much higher compression ratios than even other rotary valve engines due to a significant but undisclosed new cooling method of the combustion chamber and the ability to eliminate the throttle completely, making it vastly more economical at lower engine speeds, so it is claimed.

A proven completely successful automotive rotary valve engine has been built by the late Ralph Ogden Watson of Auckland New Zealand, during 1989. The car has covered many trouble free miles from that date and remains in use. Success was achieved as a result of Watson&#x27;s academic approach to the problem of sealing, his study of previous designs, and his particular combination of knowledge of materials, machining skills, experience with engines, perseverance and realistic expectations. No new or only recently available materials were involved. Full details of the development of the car and engine appear in the book &quot;Ralph Watson Special Engineer,&quot; first published 2004, ISBN O-476-01371-2 and available free and easily searchable, on the internet as of 2020. The car is currently owned by Ray Ferner.

A U.S. company named VAZTEC has created a compliant rotary valve sealing system that solves the friction and sealing problems of previous designs. They have built ten prototype engines from a 5.3L V-8 to a handheld 28cc four stroke. VAZTEC has also built a successful Diesel engine that contained the high compression pressures of a compression ignition engine (20:1 compression ratio, 100 bar combustion pressure). They are working with various OE manufacturers to commercialize their design. Various patents cover the compliant seal, including U.S. Patent 9,903,239. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the VAZTEC rotary valve can be viewed at this link.

===Two-stroke engines===
A rotary valve in the form of a flat disc, also known as a disc valve, is used in two-stroke motorcycle engines, where the arrangement helps to prevent reverse flow back into the intake port during the compression stroke.
Austrian engine manufacturer Rotax used rotary intake valves in their now out-of-production Rotax 532 two-stroke engine design and continues to use rotary intake valves in the 532&#x27;s successor, the current-production Rotax 582. 

==Use in production engines==
UK company &quot;RCV Engines Ltd&quot; uses rotating cylinder liner technology as a specialized form of rotary valve in some of their four-stroke model engine and small-engine line-up. RCV also use horizontal and vertical rotary valves in four-stroke engines in their current range of engines.

RCV have developed a 125cc rotating cylinder liner engine, incorporating a rotating valve in the cylinder liner, for scooter applications. PGO Scooters of Taiwan were working with RCV in developing the engine for their applications.

The Suzuki RG500 &quot;Gamma&quot; was powered by a two-stroke, rotary valve, twin crank, square four engine displacing 498 cubic centimeters. The power output was 93.7 brake horsepower (69.9 kW) at 9,500 RPM.

==Use in chromatography==
Rotary valves are used for loading samples on columns used for liquid or gas chromatography. The valves used in these methods are usually 6-port, 2-position rotary valves.

<doc id="1121577" wikidata="Q749247" url="?curid=1121577" title="Cimbasso">
<text>The cimbasso is a low brass instrument that covers the same range as a tuba or contrabass trombone. First appearing in Italy in the early 19th century as an upright serpent, the term &quot;cimbasso&quot; came to denote several instruments that could play the lowest brass part in 19th century Italian opera orchestras. The modern cimbasso design, first appearing as the in the 1880s, has four to six rotary valves (or occasionally piston valves), a forward-facing bell, and a predominantly cylindrical bore. These features lend its sound to the bass of the trombone family rather than the tuba, and its valves allow for more agility than a contrabass trombone. Like the modern contrabass trombone, it is most often pitched in F, although models are occasionally made in E♭ and low C or B♭.

In the modern orchestra, cimbasso parts are usually played by tuba players as a doubling instrument. Although most commonly used for performances of late Romantic Italian opera, it has since found increased and more diverse use. Jazz musician uses cimbasso in big bands and as a solo instrument. Cimbasso is now commonly called for in film and video game soundtracks. Los Angeles tuba players Tommy Johnson, Doug Tornquist and Jim Self have featured on many Hollywood recordings playing cimbasso, particularly since the popularisation of loud, low-brass heavy orchestral soundtracks.

==Etymology ==

The Italian word , first appearing in the early 19th century, is thought to be a contraction used by musicians of the term or (), sometimes appearing in scores as &quot;c. basso&quot; or &quot;c. in basso&quot;. The term was used loosely to refer to the lowest bass instrument available in the brass family, which changed over the course of the 19th century. In the mid-20th century the word &quot;cimbasso&quot; began to be used in German-speaking countries to refer to slide contrabass trombones in F. This vagueness long impeded research into the instrument&#x27;s history.

== History ==
The first uses of a cimbasso in Italian opera scores from the early 19th century referred to a narrow-bore upright serpent similar to the (), which were in common use in military bands of the time. These instruments were constructed from wooden sections like a bassoon, with a trombone-like brass bell, sometimes in the shape of a buccin-style dragon&#x27;s head. Fingering charts published in 1830 indicate these early were most likely to have been pitched in C.

Later, the term was extended to a range of instruments, including the ophicleide and early valved instruments, such as the Pelittone and other early forms of the more conical bass tuba. As this progressed, the term &quot;cimbasso&quot; was used to refer to a more blending voice than the &quot;basso tuba&quot; or &quot;bombardone&quot;, and began to imply the lowest trombone.

By 1872, Verdi expressed his displeasure about &quot;that devilish &quot;bombardone&quot; (referring to an early valved tuba) as the bass of the trombone section for his La Scala première of &quot;Aida&quot;, preferring a &quot;trombone basso&quot;&quot;. By the time of his opera &quot;Otello&quot; in 1887, Milan instrument maker had produced the (sometimes , or simply ). Although no Pelitti instruments, photographs or diagrams survive, it was a contrabass trombone in low 18′ B♭ wrapped in a compact form with 3 or 4 rotary valves. Verdi and Puccini both wrote for this instrument in their later operas, although confusingly, they often referred to it as the , to distinguish it from the tenor trombones. This instrument blended well with the usual Italian section of three valve trombones, and was the prototype for the modern cimbasso.

By the early 20th century the tuba was used in Italy for cimbasso parts, and the &quot;trombone Verdi&quot;, made mainly by Milanese and Bohemian manufacturers, disappeared from Italian orchestras. In 1959 German instrument maker Hans Kunitz developed a slide contrabass trombone in F with two valves based on a 1929 patent by Berlin trombonist Ernst Dehmel. These were built in the 1960s by Gebr. Alexander and named &quot;cimbasso&quot; trombones. The modern cimbasso found today emerged in Germany in 1985 by the brass instrument maker Josef Meinl, its design ultimately descended from the Pelitti &quot;trombone Verdi&quot; design. A contrabass trombone in F but fitted with the valves and fingering of a modern F tuba wrapped in-front of the player, it was quickly adopted throughout Europe by players and other makers, including Bavarian maker Thein Brass.

== Construction ==

The modern cimbasso is usually built with four to six rotary valves (or occasionally piston valves), a forward-facing bell, and a cylindrical bore. These features lend its sound to the bass of the trombone family rather than the tuba, and its valves allow for more agility than a contrabass trombone. Like the modern contrabass trombone, it is most often pitched in 12-foot (12′) F, although instruments are made in 13′ E♭ and occasionally low 16′ C or 18′ B♭.

The mouthpiece and leadpipe are positioned in front of the player, and the mouthpiece receiver is sized to fit tuba mouthpieces. The valve tubing section is arranged vertically between the player&#x27;s knees and rests on the floor with a cello-style endpin, and the bell is arranged over the player&#x27;s left shoulder to point horizontally forward, similar to a trombone. This design accommodates the instrument in cramped orchestra pits and allows a direct, concentrated sound to be projected towards the conductor and audience.

The bore tends to range between that of a contrabass trombone and a small F tuba, , and even larger for the larger instruments in low C or B♭. The bell diameter is usually between .
There has been demand over time for larger bore instruments with a more conical bore and larger bell, in contrast with the trombone-like sound from smaller cylindrical bore instruments. This is because cimbasso parts are often played by tuba players, particularly in US orchestras. Czech manufacturer Červený catered to both needs in its 2021 catalog which lists two cimbassi in F, one model with a small bore and bell listed with their valve trombones, and another with a tuba-like bore of and a larger bell with much wider flare, listed with their tubas.

The cimbasso is usually built with rotary valves, although some Italian makers use piston valves. British instrument maker Mike Johnson builds cimbassi with four compensating piston valves as commonly found on British tubas, in both F/C and E♭/B♭ sizes. Los Angeles tubist Jim Self had a compact F cimbasso built in the shape of a euphonium, which has been named the &quot;Jimbasso&quot;.
In 2004 Swiss brass instrument manufacturer Haag released a cimbasso in F built with five Hagmann valves and a bore. Although discontinued, this instrument is used by several operas and orchestras, including Badische Staatskapelle, Hungarian State Opera, and Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and by Swedish jazz musician .

== Repertoire and performance ==

Although the cimbasso in its modern form is most commonly used for performances of late Romantic Italian operas by Verdi and Puccini, since the mid 20th century it has found increased and more diverse use. It has occasionally appeared in modern scores, such as Russian composer Boris Tishchenko&#x27;s fifth and eighth symphonies, Swedish composer Anders Hillborg&#x27;s &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; (2005), and English composer Brian Ferneyhough&#x27;s New Complexity work &quot;Plötzlichkeit&quot; (2006).

Along with the contrabass trombone, it has increasingly been called for in film and video game soundtracks. Los Angeles tuba players Tommy Johnson, Doug Tornquist and Jim Self have appeared on many Hollywood soundtracks playing cimbasso, especially since the popularization of loud, low-brass heavy orchestral music in films and video games such as the remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001), &quot;Call of Duty&quot; (2003) and &quot;Inception&quot; (2010). American nu metal band Korn used two cimbassos in the live backing orchestra for their acoustic &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album. Swedish jazz musicians Per–Åke Holmlander and Mattis Cederberg employ cimbasso in jazz as a solo instrument, and for playing the fourth trombone parts in big bands.

Historically informed performance of early cimbasso parts presents particular challenges. Unless proficient with period instruments such as serpent or ophicleide, it is difficult for orchestral low-brass players to perform on instruments that resemble the early &quot;cimbassi&quot; in form or timbre. It is also challenging for instrument builders to find good surviving examples to replicate or adapt. 

Although there is still a lack of consensus from conductors and orchestras, using a large-bore modern orchestral C tuba to play cimbasso parts is considered inappropriate by some writers and players. Italian organologist Renato Meucci recommends using only a small narrow-bore F tuba, or a bass trombone. James Gourlay, conductor and former tubist with BBC Symphony Orchestra and Zürich Opera, recommends playing most cimbasso repertoire on the modern F cimbasso, as a compromise between the larger B♭ instrument and the bass trombone. He also recommends using a euphonium in the absence of a period instrument for early cimbasso parts, which is closer to the sound of the serpent or ophicleide that would have been used before 1860. Douglas Yeo, former bass trombonist with Boston Symphony Orchestra, even suggests that in a modern section of slide trombonists playing parts intended for valved instruments, it should not be unreasonable to perform the cimbasso part on a modern (slide) contrabass trombone.

<text>Wilkes Land is a large district of land in eastern Antarctica, formally claimed by Australia as part of the Australian Antarctic Territory, though the validity of this claim has been placed for the period of the operation of the Antarctic Treaty, to which Australia is a signatory.

==Geography==
Wilkes Land fronts on the southern Indian Ocean between Queen Mary Coast and Adelie Land, extending from Cape Hordern in 100°31&#x27; E to Pourquoi Pas Point, in 136°11&#x27; E. The region extends as a sector about 2600 km towards the South Pole, with an estimated land area of 2,600,000 km², mostly glaciated.

===Subdivisions===
It is further subdivided in the following coastal areas which can also be thought of as sectors extending to the South Pole:

# Knox Coast: 100°31&#x27; E to 109°16&#x27; E
# Budd Coast: 109°16&#x27; E to 115°33&#x27; E
# Sabrina Coast: 115°33&#x27; E to 122°05&#x27; E
# Banzare Coast: 122°05&#x27; E to 130°10&#x27; E
# Clarie Coast: (Wilkes Coast) 130°10&#x27; E to 136°11&#x27; E

In a wider sense, Wilkes Land extends further East to Point Alden in 142°02&#x27; E, thereby including Adélie Land, which is claimed by France.

==Name==
Wilkes Land is named after Lieutenant Charles Wilkes (later a rear admiral), the American explorer who commanded the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition. The naming is in recognition of Wilkes&#x27; discovery of the continental margin over a distance of 2,400 km (1,500 miles) of coast, thus providing substantial proof that Antarctica is a continent. This definition of extent excludes the area east of 142°02&#x27; E, George V Land, which was sighted by Wilkes but has been shown by later expeditions to be further south than the positions originally assigned by him.

==Geology==
In 2006, a team of researchers led by Ralph von Frese and Laramie Potts used gravity measurements by NASA&#x27;s GRACE satellites to discover the 300-mile-wide Wilkes Land crater, which probably formed about 250 million years ago.

==In popular culture==
Wilkes Land is featured prominently in the 1998 film &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Fox Mulder journeys to Antarctica to save his partner Dana Scully, who is being held there against her will. In the process, they discover a huge secret lab under the surface run by the Cigarette-Smoking Man.

<doc id="1121587" wikidata="Q3327702" url="?curid=1121587" title="Schur multiplier">
<text>In mathematical group theory, the Schur multiplier or Schur multiplicator is the second homology group formula_1 of a group &quot;G&quot;. It was introduced by in his work on projective representations.

==Examples and properties==
The Schur multiplier formula_2 of a finite group &quot;G&quot; is a finite abelian group whose exponent divides the order of &quot;G&quot;. If a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is cyclic for some &quot;p&quot;, then the order of formula_2 is not divisible by &quot;p&quot;. In particular, if all Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroups of &quot;G&quot; are cyclic, then formula_2 is trivial.

For instance, the Schur multiplier of the nonabelian group of order 6 is the trivial group since every Sylow subgroup is cyclic. The Schur multiplier of the elementary abelian group of order 16 is an elementary abelian group of order 64, showing that the multiplier can be strictly larger than the group itself. The Schur multiplier of the quaternion group is trivial, but the Schur multiplier of dihedral 2-groups has order 2.

The Schur multipliers of the finite simple groups are given at the list of finite simple groups. The covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups are of considerable recent interest.

==Relation to projective representations==
Schur&#x27;s original motivation for studying the multiplier was to classify projective representations of a group, and the modern formulation of his definition is the second cohomology group formula_5. A projective representation is much like a group representation except that instead of a homomorphism into the general linear group formula_6, one takes a homomorphism into the projective general linear group formula_7. In other words, a projective representation is a representation modulo the center.

 showed that every finite group &quot;G&quot; has associated to it at least one finite group &quot;C&quot;, called a Schur cover, with the property that every projective representation of &quot;G&quot; can be lifted to an ordinary representation of &quot;C&quot;. The Schur cover is also known as a covering group or Darstellungsgruppe. The Schur covers of the finite simple groups are known, and each is an example of a quasisimple group. The Schur cover of a perfect group is uniquely determined up to isomorphism, but the Schur cover of a general finite group is only determined up to isoclinism.

==Relation to central extensions==
The study of such covering groups led naturally to the study of central and stem extensions.

A central extension of a group &quot;G&quot; is an extension
:formula_8
where formula_9 is a subgroup of the center of &quot;C&quot;.

A stem extension of a group &quot;G&quot; is an extension
:formula_8
where formula_11 is a subgroup of the intersection of the center of &quot;C&quot; and the derived subgroup of &quot;C&quot;; this is more restrictive than central.

If the group &quot;G&quot; is finite and one considers only stem extensions, then there is a largest size for such a group &quot;C&quot;, and for every &quot;C&quot; of that size the subgroup &quot;K&quot; is isomorphic to the Schur multiplier of &quot;G&quot;. If the finite group &quot;G&quot; is moreover perfect, then &quot;C&quot; is unique up to isomorphism and is itself perfect. Such &quot;C&quot; are often called universal perfect central extensions of &quot;G&quot;, or covering group (as it is a discrete analog of the universal covering space in topology). If the finite group &quot;G&quot; is not perfect, then its Schur covering groups (all such &quot;C&quot; of maximal order) are only isoclinic.

It is also called more briefly a universal central extension, but note that there is no largest central extension, as the direct product of &quot;G&quot; and an abelian group form a central extension of &quot;G&quot; of arbitrary size.

Stem extensions have the nice property that any lift of a generating set of &quot;G&quot; is a generating set of &quot;C&quot;. If the group &quot;G&quot; is presented in terms of a free group &quot;F&quot; on a set of generators, and a normal subgroup &quot;R&quot; generated by a set of relations on the generators, so that formula_12, then the covering group itself can be presented in terms of &quot;F&quot; but with a smaller normal subgroup &quot;S&quot;, that is, formula_13. Since the relations of &quot;G&quot; specify elements of &quot;K&quot; when considered as part of &quot;C&quot;, one must have formula_14.

In fact if &quot;G&quot; is perfect, this is all that is needed: &quot;C&quot; ≅ [&quot;F&quot;,&quot;F&quot;]/[&quot;F&quot;,&quot;R&quot;] and M(&quot;G&quot;) ≅ &quot;K&quot; ≅ &quot;R&quot;/[&quot;F&quot;,&quot;R&quot;]. Because of this simplicity, expositions such as handle the perfect case first. The general case for the Schur multiplier is similar but ensures the extension is a stem extension by restricting to the derived subgroup of &quot;F&quot;: M(&quot;G&quot;) ≅ (&quot;R&quot; ∩ [&quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;])/[&quot;F&quot;, &quot;R&quot;]. These are all slightly later results of Schur, who also gave a number of useful criteria for calculating them more explicitly.

==Relation to efficient presentations==
In combinatorial group theory, a group often originates from a presentation. One important theme in this area of mathematics is to study presentations with as few relations as possible, such as one relator groups like Baumslag–Solitar groups. These groups are infinite groups with two generators and one relation, and an old result of Schreier shows that in any presentation with more generators than relations, the resulting group is infinite. The borderline case is thus quite interesting: finite groups with the same number of generators as relations are said to have a deficiency zero. For a group to have deficiency zero, the group must have a trivial Schur multiplier because the minimum number of generators of the Schur multiplier is always less than or equal to the difference between the number of relations and the number of generators, which is the negative deficiency. An &quot;efficient group&quot; is one where the Schur multiplier requires this number of generators.

A fairly recent topic of research is to find efficient presentations for all finite simple groups with trivial Schur multipliers. Such presentations are in some sense nice because they are usually short, but they are difficult to find and to work with because they are ill-suited to standard methods such as coset enumeration.

==Relation to topology==
In topology, groups can often be described as finitely presented groups and a fundamental question is to calculate their integral homology formula_15. In particular, the second homology plays a special role and this led Heinz Hopf to find an effective method for calculating it. The method in is also known as Hopf&#x27;s integral homology formula and is identical to Schur&#x27;s formula for the Schur multiplier of a finite group:

:formula_16

where formula_12 and &quot;F&quot; is a free group. The same formula also holds when &quot;G&quot; is a perfect group.

The recognition that these formulas were the same led Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane to the creation of cohomology of groups. In general, 
:formula_18 
where the star denotes the algebraic dual group. Moreover, when &quot;G&quot; is finite, there is an unnatural isomorphism 
:formula_19

The Hopf formula for formula_20 has been generalised to higher dimensions. For one approach and references see the paper by Everaert, Gran and Van der Linden listed below.

A perfect group is one whose first integral homology vanishes. A superperfect group is one whose first two integral homology groups vanish. The Schur covers of finite perfect groups are superperfect. An acyclic group is a group all of whose reduced integral homology vanishes.

==Applications==
The second algebraic K-group K2(&quot;R&quot;) of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; can be identified with the second homology group &quot;H&quot;2(&quot;E&quot;(&quot;R&quot;), Z) of the group &quot;E&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) of (infinite) elementary matrices with entries in &quot;R&quot;.

<text>Jerome is an unincorporated community in Hillsdale County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Somerset Township.

As an unincorporated community, Jerome has no legal autonomy of its own but does have its own post office with the 49249 ZIP Code.

==Geography== 
Jerome is a small community located in northeastern Hillsdale County in southeast Michigan. Located within Somerset Township, the community sits at an elevation of .

The community is located about south of the county line with Jackson County. Jerome is not served by any major highways, although U.S. Route 12 (East Chicago Road) is about to the north. The nearest airport is the privately-owned general aviation Davis Field to the south. Other nearby unincorporated communities include Moscow to the northwest, Somerset Center and the census-designated place of Lake LeAnn to the northeast, and Wheatland to the southeast. The village of North Adams is to the southwest.

Goose Lake is a lake located just north of the center of the community. The lake is connected to numerous other lakes in the area by Goose Creek, which is part of the River Raisin watershed. The Kathe &amp; Cali Memorial County Park is located along the lake. The Bundy Hill Offroad Park is located just north of Jerome and is promoted as the largest privately owned off-road vehicle park in southeast Michigan.

Jerome has its own post office located in the center of the community at 8650 North Jerome Road. The post office uses the 49249 ZIP Code, which serves a much larger area. The ZIP Code serves the western portion of Somerset Township, as well as smaller portions of Adams Township, Moscow Township, and Wheatland Township. A small portion of Liberty Township in Jackson County to the north also uses the Jerome 49249 ZIP Code. The community is served by North Adams-Jerome Schools to the southwest in Adams Township.

==History==
The Detroit, Hillsdale and Indiana Railroad branch of the Fort Wayne, Jackson and Saginaw Railroad began building rail lines through the forested area in western Somerset Township in 1869. The area was sparsely developed but was quickly settled in anticipation of the newfound railway. A train depot was built, and this allowed for the selling of land for a potential new community. A new community was officially platted by landowner Jerome Smith on April 18, 1871, who named the community after himself. On the same date, the community also received a post office named Jerome, and Smith himself served as the first postmaster while also working as an agent for the railroad. The post office has remained in continuous operation. The train depot was also named Jerome and soon became part of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. Jerome developed rapidly and appeared along the railway on an 1872 map of Somerset Township.

Jerome developed as a farming and mercantile community, using the new railway to ship its grain and other products. Along with the train depot and post office, numerous businesses began operating in Jerome. By 1879, the community grew to include a boarding house, four general stores, meat market, two millineries, shoeshop, blacksmith, copper manufacturer, physician, schoolhouse, hotel, Independent Order of Odd Fellows hall, and a congregational church. In the early 1890s, the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Milwaukee Railroad also built a line through the area but did not build a train depot in Jerome. The two rail lines crossed each other here but did not have an interchange at this point, although access and services to the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Milwaukee Railroad may have been available in Jerome. The two rail lines appear running through Jerome on an 1894 map of Somerset Township. 
The Jerome Creamery Company was established in 1899 and used the railways to transport its products as far north as Pontiac.

In 1906, a large brick schoolhouse was built along Harrison Street, and it served as the sole building for Jerome Public Schools. The school originally served all grades as an independent school district until it consolidated with the school district in North Adams to form North Adams-Jerome Schools in the early 1950s. When the districts merged, the schoolhouse in Jerome was converted into an elementary school, and students went to North Adams to continue their education after fifth grade. The Jerome Public Schools building closed by the end of the 1960s, and the building now serves as a community center and public park. Both railway lines running through the community were also disestablished and eventually removed entirely, and Jerome is no longer served by any railroads.

<text>Somerset Center is an unincorporated community in Hillsdale County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located along U.S. Highway 12 (US 12) within Somerset Township.

As an unincorporated community, Somerset Center has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 49282 ZIP Code.

==Geography== 

Somerset Center is located in southeast Michigan in the northeastern corner of Hillsdale County. Located within Somerset Township on the outer edge of the Irish Hills region, the community sits at an elevation of , which is among the highest elevations in southeast Michigan. 

The community is located about south of the county line with Jackson County. US 12, known locally as Chicago Road, is the main roadway through the community, and it has a junction with US 127 about to the east. Nearby incorporated villages include Cement City to the northeast and Addison further away to the southeast. Other nearby unincorporated communities include Somerset directly to the east, Jerome to the southwest, the census-designated place of Lake LeAnn directly to the northeast, and Liberty in Jackson County to the north. 

The area contains numerous lakes near Somerset Center. The largest of these lakes is Lake LeAnn, and some of the other named lakes include Blood Lake, Crystal Lake, Lake Somerset, Lombard Lake, Mission Lake, and Moon Lake. Many of these lakes are connected by Goose Creek, which is part of the River Raisin watershed. Somerset State Game Area is a state game area located within the township just south of Somerset Center. The source of Michigan&#x27;s longest river, Grand River, is located just north of Somerset Center.

The Somerset Township Hall and Fire Department are located within Somerset Center in the same building at 12715 East Chicago Road. The Somerset Center post office is located at 12631 East Chicago Road. The Somerset Center 49282 ZIP Code serves only a small centralized area of Somerset Township, including the western portion of Somerset, which does not have its own physical post office and uses the Somerset Center post office for its own post office box services with the 49281 ZIP Code. The surrounding area may also be served by the Jerome 49249 ZIP Code, which serves a much larger area. The community is served by Addison Community Schools to the southwest in the village of Addison in Lenawee County.

==History==
The area was first settled when Elias Alley, who came from Cayuga County, New York, built his home here as early as 1833. Cornelius Millspaw may have been the first settler in the area around this time, but he never finished his log cabin or settled in the area. Many of the first settlers in the area became wheat harvesters and merchants. 

Somerset Center was slightly west of the community of Somerset, which was settled one year earlier by James Van Hoevenburg. Throughout its early history, the community was spelled interchangeably as Somerset Center or Somerset Centre. In 1835, Hillsdale County was formally organized, and the largely undeveloped area became part of the newly established Wheatland Township. Thomas Gamble, who purchased the Hoevenburg homestead, became the first postmaster when a post office began operating on September 9, 1835. The post office was first named Wheatland after the township. It was soon renamed to Gambleville on October 17, 1837, when the northern 36-square-mile survey township area of Wheatland Township was separated into Somerset Township. In 1841, the post office was renamed Somerset after the township, which itself was named after Somerset, New York. The post office was relocated to the centralized portion of the township and renamed Somerset Centre, only to eventually be moved back to its original location to the east. It again took the name Gambleville, where it would again be changed to the name Somerset by 1872.

The community can be seen on an 1857 map of Hillsdale County. The community was officially platted on February 17, 1872. On an 1872 map of Somerset Township, Somerset Centre can be seen in section 10 along the Chicago Road; Somerset (then known as Somerset Station) can be seen to the east in section 12. With the Somerset post office still operating, Somerset Centre would receive its own separate post office on June 19, 1872. The post office was originally spelled as Somerset Centre until it was respelled as Somerset Center on November 25, 1893. Around that time, the community received a train station along the newly constructed Detroit, Hillsdale, &amp; Southwestern Railroad, which later became the Ypsilanti Branch of the New York Central Railroad.

One of the most notable early residents of Somerset Center was William Herbert Lee McCourtie, who was born near here in 1872. After graduating college, he moved to Texas and became very wealthy in the cement industry. He returned to Somerset Center to live with his family and bought his family farm in 1924. He transformed the estate into a recreation area known as Aiden Lair that hosted many lavish events and prominent guests, including Henry Ford. In the early 1930s, he commissioned the creation of numerous cement bridges over the small stream running through the estate, and the unique design of the concrete was sculpted to look like wood. McCourtie died in 1933 at the age of 61, and the estate passed through multiple owners. The old farmhouse, which was built in the 1850s was deemed too expensive to restore and was demolished; the bridges and some older structures remain. The township purchased the property in 1987 and converted it into a public park known as McCourtie Park, which is along the US 12 Heritage Trail through the community. 

The Somerset Center Cemetery is located in the center of the community along Waldron Road and U.S. Route 12. William H. L. McCourtie and his family mausoleum are located within Somerset Center Cemetery. The McCourtie Mausoleum, which was built in 1927, is listed as a Michigan State Historic Site. The William H. L. McCourtie Estate is also recognized as both a state historic site and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="1121598" wikidata="Q7537878" url="?curid=1121598" title="Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail">
<text>The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail is a hiking trail that descends from the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains in California to the Pacific Ocean, passing through Castle Rock State Park and Big Basin Redwoods State Park. Big Basin is California&#x27;s oldest state park. In August 2020, the CZU Lightning Complex fires damaged much of the route and the trail remains mostly closed.

==History==

The trail was started in 1969 by the Sempervirens Fund of Conservation Associates of the Sierra Club and was extended to the Pacific by 1978 with the acquisition of the Hoover Ranch near Waddell Beach. Planning began in 1968, with the initial trail segment to follow the state-controlled right-of-way along SR 9, linking Saratoga Gap to Big Basin. A &quot;trail breaking party&quot; was scheduled for April 1969; local Boy Scouts participated in building the trail. During that event, the first of what would become annual &quot;Trail Days&quot; cleanups, nearly 2,500 volunteers cleared and created almost of trails, including the first segment of Skyline-to-the-Sea.

The final segment, extending the western terminus to the Pacific Ocean at Waddell Beach, opened to the public in July 1978. It traverses the Rancho del Oso area of Big Basin, which was acquired by the state in 1977. Prior to the expansion of Big Basin, individual permission was required to follow the trail to the sea over private lands. The Sempervirens Fund launched a new project in 1979 to acquire an additional of land for the trail, with the goal of relocating it further away from SR 9.

After the August 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires, the trail closed, along with much of Big Basin Redwoods State Park. As of February 2025, the trail remains mostly closed and its future is unclear; some portions of the trail have been reopened, but no overnight camping is allowed.

==Route==

The trail begins at Saratoga Gap on the ridge at the intersection of SR 9 and Skyline Boulevard (SR 35). The trail parallels SR 9 through Castle Rock, crosses the highway, and then follows SR 236 to Big Basin park headquarters. It then descends through Big Basin, following Waddell Creek to its outlet at Waddell Beach, for a total distance of approximately .

However, many hikers actually begin further southeast at Castle Rock due to its overnight parking facility; starting from Castle Rock, hikers first use the Saratoga Gap Trail, then the Travertine Springs Trail, joining Skyline-to-the-Sea at Beekhuis Road; this adds approximately to the total hiking distance.

The trail usually takes two to three days to complete, with nearly all thru-hikers traveling from East to West (towards the ocean); typically hikers would camp overnight at Waterman Gap, approximately from Saratoga Gap, and then at Jay Camp, near the Big Basin headquarters, approximately from Waterman Gap. Many hikers like to take a detour up Berry Creek Trail to see the waterfalls or to camp at Sunset Trail Camp, adding to the hike. It is possible to walk the entire trail in one day, though this is unusual and very difficult.

A ultramarathon is held on this trail, over the east-to-west route starting from Saratoga Gap, one or two times per year, which features an elevation gain of and loss of . , the 50K course record is 3:40:43, set in 2016.

===Access===
Santa Cruz Metro routes 35 and 40 formerly connected Big Basin State Park Headquarters and Waddell Creek, respectively, to Pacific Metro Center. Starting in fall 2011, Route 35 eliminated weekend service to Big Basin and Route 40 was short-turned at Cement Plant Road, eliminating service to Waddell Beach.

Summer weekend service was restored to Big Basin on Route 35 in 2023. Route 35B provides seasonal (spring and summer) service on weekends and holidays to Big Basin Headquarters. Buses depart from the Cavallaro Transit Center in Scotts Valley approximately every two hours between 8 AM and 4 PM, arriving at Big Basin approximately 45 minutes later. Return buses depart from Big Basin with approximately the same two-hour headways, between 8:45 AM and 5 PM.

===Extensions and connections===
As of October 2020, there is a extension that creates a &quot;Saratoga-to-the-Sea&quot; Trail. The trail originates at Saratoga Quarry Park, and terminates at Sanborn-Skyline County Park. This trail connects to the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail via a completed section of the Bay Area Ridge Trail. The park is owned by the city of Saratoga&#x27;s Parks Department.

<doc id="1121600" wikidata="Q1056751" url="?curid=1121600" title="McMurdo Sound">
<text>The McMurdo Sound is a sound in Antarctica, known as the southernmost passable body of water in the world, located approximately from the South Pole.

Captain James Clark Ross discovered the sound in February 1841 and named it after Lieutenant Archibald McMurdo of HMS &quot;Terror&quot;. The sound serves as a resupply route for cargo ships and airplanes that land on floating ice airstrips near McMurdo Station. The McMurdo seasonal Ice Runway was operated from October to December from the 1950s to the 2010s, then in December the ice breaks up and McMurdo port is opened by an Icebreaker ship and ships can resupply the Antarctic bases.

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Boundary and extents ===
The sound extends approximately 55 kilometers (34 mi) in length and width, and opens into the larger Ross Sea to the north. To the south, the sound is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf cavity, to the west lies the Royal Society Range, and to the east is Ross Island. McMurdo Sound is separated from the McMurdo Ice Shelf (part of the Ross Ice Shelf) by the Haskell Strait. Winter Quarters Bay lies at the south end of the Sound and is the southernmost port on Earth.

=== Navigability ===
While the sound is navigable, it contains a significant amount of drift ice, especially along the shoreline of Winter Quarters Bay. The pack ice that girdles the shoreline at Winter Quarters Bay and elsewhere in the sound presents a considerable obstacle to surface ships. Vessels require ice-strengthened hulls and often have to rely upon escort by icebreakers. Less than 10 percent of McMurdo Sound&#x27;s shoreline is free of ice.

During austral winter, McMurdo Sound presents a large expanse of surface ice. In summer, ships approaching the sound are often blocked by various amounts of first-year ice, fast ice (connected to the shoreline), and hard multi-year ice. Subsequently, icebreakers are required for maritime resupply missions to McMurdo Station.

Ross Island is the southernmost piece of land in Antarctica that is accessible by ship. In addition, the harbour at McMurdo&#x27;s Winter Quarters Bay is the world&#x27;s southernmost seaport (Department of Geography, Texas A&amp;M University). The access by ships depends upon favorable ice conditions.

Tourism is increasingly popular in other parts of Antarctica but remains limited in McMurdo Sound due to the extreme sea conditions.

=== Temperatures ===

Cold circumpolar currents of the Southern Ocean shrink the flow of warm South Pacific or South Atlantic waters reaching McMurdo Sound and other Antarctic coastal waters. McMurdo Sound experiences katabatic winds from the Antarctic polar plateau. McMurdo Sound freezes over with sea ice about thick during the winter. During the austral summer when the pack ice breaks up, wind and currents may push the ice northward into the Ross Sea, stirring up cold bottom currents that spill into the ocean basins. Temperatures during the winter months at McMurdo Station have dropped as low as . December and January are the warmest months, with average highs at .

=== Effects of wind ===

Polar winds are a driving force behind weather systems arising from three surface zones that converge at McMurdo Sound: the polar plateau and the Transantarctic Mountains, the Ross Ice Shelf, and the Ross Sea. These surface zones create a range of dynamic weather systems. Cold, heavy air descending rapidly from the polar plateau at elevations of or more spawns fierce katabatic winds. These dry winds can reach hurricane force when they reach the Antarctic coast. Wind instruments recorded Antarctica&#x27;s highest wind velocity at the coastal station Dumont d&#x27;Urville in July 1972 at (Australian Government Antarctic Division).

Prevailing winds into McMurdo Sound shoot between mountain passes and other land formations, producing blizzards known locally as &quot;Herbies&quot;. Such blizzards can occur any time of year. Residents of McMurdo Station and Scott Base have dubbed the nearby White Island and Black Island &quot;Herbie Alley&quot; due to winds that funnel blizzards between the islands (Field Manual for the U.S. Antarctic Program).

Overall the continent&#x27;s extremely cold air does not hold enough moisture for significant snowfall. The annual snowfall on Ross Island averages only . Snowfall in Antarctica&#x27;s interior is far less at . Snow seldom accumulates on the McMurdo Dry Valleys on the western shores of McMurdo Sound.

McMurdo Sound provides an important component in Antarctica&#x27;s global effects upon climate. A key factor is the polar winds that can drive the sound&#x27;s pack ice into the Ross Sea summer or winter. Frigid katabatic winds rake subsequently exposed water, causing sea ice to form. Freezing surface water excludes salt from the water below; leaving behind heavy, cold water that sinks to the ocean floor. This process repeats along Antarctica&#x27;s coastal areas, spreading cold sea water into Earth&#x27;s ocean basins.

According to an interview with climatologist Gerd Wendler, published in the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Antarctic Sun, one could dive to the ocean floor anywhere in the world and encounter water from the coast of Antarctica. &quot;Seventy-five percent of all the bottom water, wherever you are, comes from Antarctica.&quot;

===Temperatures===
*Average mean sea-level temp: .
*Monthly mean range: in January to in August.
*Stormiest months: February and October.

=== Wildlife ===

A rich sea life thrives under the barren expanse of McMurdo Sound&#x27;s ice pack. Frigid waters that would kill many other fish in the world sustain the Antarctic notothenioid, a bony &quot;ice fish&quot; related to walleyes and perch. Cactus sponges, globe sponges, starfish, sea urchins, and sea anemones are also present. Large sea spiders inhabit the depths of the sound and feed on sea anemones. Antarctic krill flourish in the upper depths of the waters
Antarctic penguins, emperor penguins, and Adélie penguins live in and around the sound. The Weddell seal, leopard seal, and crabeater seal have been spotted, as well as orcas.

==Strategic importance==
McMurdo Sound&#x27;s role as a strategic waterway dates back to early 20th-century Antarctic exploration. British explorers Ernest Shackleton and Robert Scott built bases on the Sound&#x27;s shoreline for their overland expeditions to the South Pole.

McMurdo Sound&#x27;s logistic importance continues today. Aircraft transporting cargo and passengers land on frozen runways at Williams Field on the McMurdo Ice Shelf. Moreover, the annual sealift of a cargo ship and fuel tanker rely upon the sound as a supply route to the continent&#x27;s largest base, the United States McMurdo Station. Both the U.S. base and New Zealand&#x27;s nearby Scott Base are on the southern tip of Ross Island.

==Iceberg B-15A==

In March 2000, the long Iceberg B-15, the largest ever seen at the time, broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf (Antarctic Climate &amp; Ecosystems: Cooperative Research Center) and then suddenly broke up on 27 October 2005.

Research based upon measurements retrieved from a seismometer previously placed on B-15 indicated that ocean swells caused by an earthquake away in the Gulf of Alaska caused the breakup, according to a report by the U.S. National Public Radio. Wind and sea currents shifted the smaller, but still massive Iceberg B-15A towards McMurdo Sound. B-15A&#x27;s girth temporarily blocked the outflow of pack ice from McMurdo Sound.

Iceberg B-15A&#x27;s grounding at the mouth of McMurdo Sound also blocked the path for thousands of penguins to reach their food source in open water. Moreover, pack ice built up behind the iceberg in the Ross Sea creating a nearly frozen barrier that blocked two cargo ships en route to supply McMurdo Station, according to the National Science Foundation.
The icebreakers USCGC &quot;Polar Star&quot; and the Russian &quot;Krasin&quot; were required to open a ship channel through ice up to thick. The last leg of the channel followed a route along the eastern shoreline of McMurdo Sound adjacent to Ross Island. The icebreakers escorted the tanker USNS &quot;Paul Buck&quot; to McMurdo Station&#x27;s ice pier in late January. The freighter MV &quot;American Tern&quot; followed on 3 February.

Similar pack ice blocked a National Geographic expedition aboard the &quot;Braveheart&quot; from reaching B-15A. However, expedition divers were able to explore the underwater world of another grounded tabular iceberg. They encountered a surprising environment of fish and other sea life secreted within a deep iceberg crevasse. Discoveries included starfish, crabs, and ice fish. The latter were found to have burrowed thumb-sized holes into the ice.

The expedition reported witnessing an iceberg exploding. Shards of ice erupted into the air as if a bomb went off only hours after divers surfaced and after the &quot;Braveheart&quot; moved away from the iceberg (National Geographic).

==Pollution==
More than 50 years of continuous operation of the United States and New Zealand bases on Ross Island have left pockets of severe pollution in McMurdo Sound. Until 1981, McMurdo Station residents simply towed their garbage out to the sea ice and let nature take its course. The garbage sank to the sea floor when the ice broke up in the spring, according to news reports.

A 2001 survey of the seabed near McMurdo revealed 15 vehicles, 26 shipping containers, and 603 fuel drums, as well as some 1,000 miscellaneous items dumped on an area of some . Findings by scuba divers were reported in the State of the Environment Report, a New Zealand-sponsored study.

The study by the government agency Antarctica New Zealand revealed that decades of pumping thousands of gallons of raw sewage from 1,200 summer residents into the sound had fouled Winter Quarters Bay. The pollution ended in 2003 when a $5 million waste treatment plant went online. Other documented bay water contaminants include leakage from an open dump at the station. The dump introduced heavy metals, petroleum compounds, and chemicals into the water.

A study by the Australian Institute of Marine Science found that anti-fouling paints on the hulls of icebreakers are polluting McMurdo Sound. Such paints kill algae, barnacles, and other marine life that adhere to ship hulls. Scientists found that samples taken from the ocean floor contained high levels of tributyltin (TBT), a component of the anti-fouling paints. &quot;The levels are close to the maximum you will find anywhere, apart from ship grounding sites&quot;, said Andrew Negri of the institute.

Ships, aircraft, and land-based operations in McMurdo Sound all present hazards of oil spills or fuel leaks. For instance, in 2003, the build-up of two years of difficult ice conditions blocked the U.S. tanker MV Richard G. Matthiesen from reaching the harbour at McMurdo Station, despite the assistance of icebreakers. Instead, shore workers rigged a temporary fuel line over the ice pack to discharge the ship&#x27;s cargo. The ship pumped more than of fuel to storage facilities at McMurdo.

Officials balance the potential for fuel spills inherent in such operations against the critical need to keep McMurdo Station supplied with oil. A fuel tank spill in an unrelated onshore incident in 2003 spilt roughly of Diesel fuel at a helicopter pad at McMurdo Station. The 1989 grounding of the Argentinean ship &quot;Bahía Paraíso&quot; and subsequent spillage of of oil into the sea near the Antarctic Peninsula showed the environmental hazards inherent in supply missions to Antarctica.

Zoologist Clive Evans from Auckland University described McMurdo&#x27;s harbor as &quot;one of the most polluted harbors in the world in terms of oil&quot;, according to a 2004 article by the New Zealand Herald.

=== Cleanup efforts ===
Modern operations in McMurdo Sound have sparked surface cleanup efforts, recycling, and exporting trash and other contaminants by ship. The U.S. National Science Foundation began a 5-year, $30-million cleanup program in 1989, according to Reuters News Agency. The concentrated effort targeted the open dump at McMurdo. By 2003, the U.S. Antarctic Program reported recycling approximately 70% of its wastes, according to Australia&#x27;s Herald Sun.

The 1989 cleanup included workers testing hundreds of barrels at the dump site, mostly full of fuels and human waste, for identification before they were loaded onto a freighter for exportation. The precedent for exporting waste began in 1971. The United States shipped out tons of radiation-contaminated soil after officials shut down a small nuclear power plant.

==Tourism==

Antarctica&#x27;s extreme remoteness and hazardous travel conditions limit Antarctica tourism to an expensive niche industry largely centered on the Antarctic Peninsula. The number of seaborne tourists grew more than four times throughout the 1990s, reaching more than 14,000 by 2000, up from 2,500 just a decade earlier. More than 46,000 airborne and seaborne tourists visited Antarctica during the 2007–2008 season, according to the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO).

This confederation of tour operators reports that only 5% of Antarctic tourists visit the Ross Sea area, which encompasses McMurdo Sound. Tourists congregate on the ice-free coastal zones during summer near the Antarctic Peninsula. The peninsula&#x27;s wildlife, soaring mountains, and dramatic seascapes have drawn commercial visitors since the late 1950s, when Argentina and Chile operated cruises to the South Shetland Islands.

Tourists flights began in 1957, when a Pan American Boeing 377 Stratocruiser made the first civilian flight to Antarctica. Commercial flights landed at McMurdo Sound and the South Pole in the 1960s. Routine overflights from Australia and New Zealand took place between 1977 and 1980, transporting more than 11,000 passengers, according to Antarctica New Zealand, which manages Scott Base. One such flight, Air New Zealand Flight 901, crashed into Mount Erebus on the eastern shores of McMurdo Sound. The impact, occurring in sector whiteout into the lower slopes of the active volcano, took the lives of all 257 people aboard the aircraft.

In 1969 the MS &quot;Explorer&quot; brought seagoing tourists to Antarctica (British Antarctic Survey). The cruise&#x27;s founder, Lars-Eric Lindblad, coupled expeditionary cruising with education. He is quoted as saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t protect what you don&#x27;t know&quot; (IAATO). In the decades since then, ships engaged in Antarctic sightseeing cruises have grown in size and number.
Infrequent Antarctic cruises have included passenger vessels carrying up to 960 tourists (IAATO). Such vessels may conduct so-called &quot;drive-by&quot; cruises, with no landings made ashore.

The Russian icebreaker &quot;Kapitan Khlebnikov&quot; (picture to the right) has conducted voyages to the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea regions since 1992. High-latitude cruises in dense pack ice are only achievable during the austral summer season, November into March. In 1997, the vessel &quot;Kapitan Khlebnikov&quot; claimed the distinction of being the first ship to circumnavigate Antarctica with passengers (Quark Expeditions). Passengers aboard the icebreaker make landings aboard Zodiac inflatable boats to explore remote beaches. Their itinerary may also include stops at Ross Island&#x27;s historic explorer huts at Discovery Point near McMurdo Station or Cape Royds (Antarctica New Zealand). Additionally, the Russian icebreaker extends the reach of tourism by launching helicopter trips from its decks, including visits to sites such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys and areas noted for wildlife viewing.

The &quot;&#x27;Spirit of Enderby&quot; has been conducting cruises to the Ross Sea region for many years, including McMurdo Sound. Although the &quot;Enderby&quot; has an ice-strengthened hull, the ship is not an icebreaker. The &quot;Enderby&quot; sports Zodiac inflatable boats, a hovercraft for Antarctica voyages, and all-terrain vehicles for over ice or overland travel. Land-based tourism in Antarctica, however, continues to be rare. Antarctica lacks a permanent land-based tourism facility, despite the annual surge in the number of visitors.

The International Association of Tour Operators (IAATO) has established voluntary standards to discourage tourists from disrupting wildlife. Nonetheless, large ships, carrying more than 400 passengers, may spend up to 12 hours transporting tourists to and from breeding sites. Such large-ship operations expose wildlife to humans far longer than smaller vessels.

==Prominent features==

<doc id="1121604" wikidata="Q6757033" url="?curid=1121604" title="Marchmont">
<text>Marchmont () is a mainly residential area of Edinburgh, Scotland. It lies roughly one mile to the south of the Old Town, separated from it by The Meadows and Bruntsfield Links. To the west it is bounded by Bruntsfield; to the south-southwest by Greenhill and then Morningside; to the south-southeast by The Grange; and to the east by Sciennes.

The area is characterised by four- and five-storey tenements blocks built in the Scots Baronial style. Most of the area was developed in the 1870s and 1880s and there has been little change to its structure since then. Marchmont remains popular with older residents, young professionals and students. In 1987, it was designated as a conservation area, the boundaries of which were extended in 1996 to include the Meadows, Bruntsfield Links and
immediately surrounding streets.

==History==

Marchmont was named after the 5th Earl of Marchmont, Hugh Hume Campbell, whose title in turn derives from the hill on which Roxburgh Castle was built. The name is Brittonic and probably means “the hill-pasture for horses”.

The area was developed as a planned middle-class suburb by Sir George Warrender (the son-in-law of Hugh Hume Campbell), who owned Bruntsfield House and the surrounding estate (which was also known as the Warrender Park) in the middle of the 19th century. This was at a time of rapid population growth in Edinburgh, stimulating a significant increase in the demand for housing. The original feuing plan laid out by architect David Bryce in 1869 called for mainly terraced villas, with a number of large, detached villas on Marchmont Road. However, this was superseded by a more comprehensive plan prepared by the firm of John Watherston &amp; Sons. This proposed that all buildings were to be four- or five-storey tenements, some with commercial premises on the ground floor frontages.

Most of the buildings were completed in the 1870s and 1880s. The first tenements to go up were mostly in pink sandstone in the Scots Baronial style; these are by architects such as Edward Calvert. The later buildings, which were often in blonde sandstone and in a plainer, more uniform style, include works by Hippolyte Blanc, John Charles Hay and Thomas P. Marwick. Key buildings such as churches are mainly by the then city architect, Robert Morham.

Originally, the area was not allowed to have any premises selling alcohol, although that is no longer the case.

=== Street names ===

As was the usual practice at the time, the area&#x27;s street names were derived from members of the developer&#x27;s family or places associated with them. Sir George Warrender&#x27;s wife, Helen, was the daughter of the 5th Earl of Marchmont, hence the name of the district. Thirlestane Street and Lauderdale Street were named in honour of Sir George&#x27;s mother, who was the daughter of the Earl of Lauderdale and whose family seat was at Thirlestane Castle. Spottiswoode Street and Spottiswoode Road were named for John Spottiswoode, another Warrender relation, while Arden, as in Arden Street, was the family name of the Earl of Haddington, who married one of the Warrender daughters.

==Marchmont today==
Due to its proximity to the city centre, the presence of local amenities, and generally being considered a pleasant area, Marchmont is considered a desirable location in which to live. This is reflected in its generally high property prices. It is popular with students, with both the University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Napier University within easy walking distance, as well as with young professionals. This has resulted in a certain friction between permanent residents and temporary ones (many of whom are students), with the &quot;Marchmont Action Group Promoting Initiatives for the Environment&quot; (MAGPIE) unsuccessfully petitioning the Scottish Parliament in 2005 to impose quotas on shared accommodation by restricting the number of licences for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) granted for the area.

=== Sewer upgrade project ===
Scottish Water began a sewer upgrade project in September 2022, which will help reduce the risk of flooding to properties in the neighborhood by &quot;increasing the capacity of the sewer network,&quot; which is especially important during heavy rainfall. The project is delivered by their alliance partner Caledonia Water Alliance and is intended to be completed by spring 2025. The underground tank will be installed in Bruntsfield Links at the corner of Warrender Park Terrace and Marchmont Road. Impacts of the project include reduced parking, road closures, bus service disruption, noise, and mild vibration.

==Notable buildings==

The Warrender Baths building in Thirlestane Road, was opened in 1887 on land donated by Sir George Warrender. It houses a swimming pool and a fitness complex. It is noted for its neo-Jacobean frontage, its mosaic tiling and its old-fashioned poolside changing facilities. The building is a Category B listed building.

Marchmont St Giles Church is situated to the immediate south of the area, at the north end of Kilgraston Road. It has been described as one of the most prominent landmarks of south Edinburgh. Designed by Robert Morham, it opened in 1871, replacing a previous iron building.

James Gillespie&#x27;s High School has occupied its present site between Lauderdale Street and Warrender Park Road since the 1960s. Most of the school buildings on the site were demolished in 2013 to make way for new premises which opened three years later. The site incorporates Sir George Warrender&#x27;s original Bruntsfield House, which was refurbished as part of the building project.

==Notable residents==

<text>USS &quot;Simpson&quot; (FFG-56) is an guided missile frigate of the United States Navy, named for Rear Admiral Rodger W. Simpson.

==History==
&quot;Simpson&quot; was laid down at Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 27 February 1984, launched on 31 August 1984 sponsored by Mrs. Grace Fowles-Simpson widow of Rodger W. Simpson and commissioned on 21 September 1985 in Newport, Rhode Island. The ship was delivered 13 September 1985. Bath Iron Works plans called for delivery to occur 9 August 1985, but that date slipped due to an extended strike at BIW that began 30 June 1985. &quot;Simpson&quot; was homeported at Naval Station Newport until switching to Naval Station Norfolk on 31 March 1994. &quot;Simpson&quot; moved to Naval Station Mayport in July 2001.

===1980s===
On 28 January 1986, the NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida, launched Space Shuttle mission STS-51L utilizing the orbiter vehicle &quot;Challenger&quot; at 1138 EST. Escaping propellant combustion products cut into the craft&#x27;s solid rocket booster, however, and 73 seconds after launch a massive explosion destroyed &quot;Challenger&quot;, killing all seven astronauts on board. &quot;Simpson&quot; took part in the ensuing search and rescue effort, and subsequently received the Coast Guard Unit Commendation with Operational &quot;O&quot; for her participation.

Beginning January 1988, &quot;Simpson&quot;″s first overseas deployment was to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Earnest Will, to escort reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers during the Iran–Iraq War. On 18 April 1988, &quot;Simpson&quot; took part in Operation Praying Mantis, the U.S. response to the mining of the frigate , which had hit an Iranian M-08 mine on 14 April 1988.

On 18 April, &quot;Simpson&quot;, along with and , destroyed Iranian naval and intelligence facilities on the oil platform Sirri in the Persian Gulf. Later that day, the ships encountered the Iranian &quot;Kaman&quot;-class (La Combattante II type) missile patrol boat &quot;Joshan&quot;, which launched a Harpoon missile at the US vessels. &quot;Simpson&quot; immediately returned missile fire, striking &quot;Joshan&quot; in her superstructure. &quot;Joshan&quot; was then sunk by combined gunfire. &quot;Simpson&quot; was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award and the Combat Action Ribbon for this operation, and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for the deployment.

===1990s===
20 February 1990, &quot;Simpson&quot; rescued 22 crew members from , a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker carrying $9 million in naphtha and gas oil. &quot;Surf City&quot; was transiting near the Iranian island of Abu Musa when it exploded, killing two and forcing the crew to abandon ship. According to Central Command, &quot;Simpson&quot; was not escorting the tanker, but was monitoring its progress from away and responded immediately to rescue the crew. The fire was so intense that US ships could not approach it and &quot;Surf City&quot; burned for two weeks. At the time, the fire was feared to be the result of an attack or a mine, but the NTSB later determined it to be an accident.

In March 1992, during &quot;Simpson&quot;&#x27;s third deployment, &quot;Simpson&quot; and escorted and two supply ships into the Persian Gulf. At the time, Iraq was refusing to comply with UN weapons inspection and the ships departed the Persian Gulf in early April after inspections resumed.

In August 1993 on &quot;Simpson&quot;″s fourth deployment she was again assigned to escort Carrier Group Six with &quot;America&quot;. During the deployment &quot;Simpson&quot; participated in Operation Deny Flight and Operation Provide Promise in the Adriatic Sea and supported Operation Continue Hope off Somalia. &quot;Simpson&quot; returned to homeport in February 1994.

In May 1994, &quot;Simpson&quot; was one of the ships enforcing United Nations sanctions on Haiti.

===1995===
&quot;Simpson&quot; deployed to the Caribbean Sea for counter drug operations in late 1994 and again in February 1995.

In November 1995, &quot;Simpson&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean joining the United States Sixth Fleet NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force Atlantic. &quot;Simpson&quot; operated in the Adriatic Sea enforcing UN arms embargo against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and participating in Operation Sharp Guard. &quot;Simpson&quot; returned to Norfolk 8 May 1996.

===2000s===

Capt. Gerald F. DeConto, &quot;Simpson&quot;″s commanding officer from September 1998 to April 2000, was killed at the Pentagon during the September 11, 2001 attacks.

In July 2002, &quot;Simpson&quot; responded to Malpelo Island to medevac a wounded Colombian Marine who had received three gunshot wounds.

&quot;Simpson&quot; deployed with Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (Light) (HSL) 44, Det. 10 as part of NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Forces Atlantic on 22 September 2004 returning 20 December 2004. &quot;Simpson&quot; visited New York City 12 October 2004 during this deployment. &quot;Simpson&quot;″s Mk 13 missile launcher was removed sometime in 2005 prior to her next deployment.

On 3 January 2006, &quot;Simpson&quot; deployed with HSL-42, Det. 9, joining Standing NRF Maritime Group 1 and participated in a number of international naval exercises in the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Eastern Mediterranean Sea returning to Mayport 24 June 2006.

On 5 October 2007, &quot;Simpson&quot; deployed with HSL-46, Det. 7 and U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) 405, to the eastern Pacific for counter narcotics operations returning April 2008. During the deployment &quot;Simpson&quot; captured 16 metric tons of cocaine. On 29 November 2007, &quot;Simpson&quot; interdicted a self-propelled semi-submersible (SPSS) capable of carrying 5–8 metric tons of cocaine. The sub was sunk by its crew, but the crew was captured and turned over to Colombia.

===2010s===
On 17 January 2012, &quot;Simpson&quot; deployed to the Sixth Fleet Area of Responsibility, participating in Africa Partnership Station 2012, and Operation Active Endeavor. Ports of call included Funchal, Rota, Casablanca, Dakar, Lagos, Accra, Mindelo, Souda Bay, Sicily, Naples and Praia. She returned to Naval Station Mayport on 17 July 2012.

On 18 September 2013, &quot;Simpson&quot; deployed once more to the United States Sixth Fleet Area of Responsibility. Ports of call included Ponta Delgada, Sicily, Bari, Athens, Valletta, Souda Bay and Casablanca. She returned to Naval Station Mayport on 20 March 2014.
&quot;Simpson&quot;″s final homeport was Naval Station Mayport, Florida, with assignment to Destroyer Squadron 14. &quot;Simpson&quot; was part of the Active Naval Reserve Force, Category A from 2002 until her decommissioning in September 2015. She was the final &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigate in service in the United States Navy. The ship is set to be put up for foreign military sale.

When &quot;Simpson&quot; was decommissioned, it meant the last United States ship still in active service to have sunk an enemy vessel was the 217-year-old USS &quot;Constitution&quot;.

<text>Kick is the sixth studio album by Australian rock band INXS, released on 19 October 1987 through WEA in Australia, Mercury Records in Europe, and Atlantic Records in the United States and Canada. The album was produced by British producer Chris Thomas, recorded by David Nicholas in Sydney and Paris and mixed by Bob Clearmountain at AIR Studios in London.

The band&#x27;s most successful studio album, &quot;Kick&quot; has been certified six times platinum by the RIAA and peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also spawned four US top 10 singles, &quot;New Sensation&quot;, &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot;, &quot;Devil Inside&quot; and &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, the last of which reached the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; singles charts.

==Background==
Between 1980 and 1984, INXS released four studio albums and had toured their native country Australia extensively. The release of &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; and its second single &quot;What You Need&quot; in 1985 brought the group international acclaim, as well as a breakthrough in the United States. The album peaked at No.11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and featured the band&#x27;s first top 5 single in the US, &quot;What You Need&quot;. After that success, the band knew their next album would have to be better. According to guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly, &quot;We wanted an album where all the songs were possible singles&quot;. Towards the end of 1986, the band members gathered at the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia to rehearse the songs that Michael Hutchence and Andrew Farriss had written.

==Recording and production==
In January 1987, INXS entered Rhinoceros Studios in Sydney to begin recording their sixth studio album, and the second with producer Chris Thomas. At the band&#x27;s request, fellow engineer David Nicholas was brought in to assist with the album&#x27;s production. Nicholas co-owned Rhinoceros recordings and had previously worked with the band on their 1982 album, &quot;Shabooh Shoobah&quot;. In the band&#x27;s 2005 official autobiography, &quot;INXS: Story to Story&quot;, Nicholas recalled: &quot;There was a really good feeling in the studio that this was going to be something big. The band had just come off a really successful tour of the US on the back of &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;, which really broke them there and they were on fire&quot;.
During production, management booked dates for the band&#x27;s upcoming European tour, which proved a problem for Thomas, as he felt the album needed more songs. &quot;They had an incredible momentum building and were gaining fans all the time&quot;, Thomas recalls. &quot;There was an audience waiting for the product, but I decided that they didn&#x27;t have the right songs yet&quot;. Thomas persuaded primary songwriters Hutchence and Andrew Farriss to fly to Hong Kong (where Hutchence and drummer Jon Farriss owned an apartment) to write more material for the forthcoming album.

While waiting for a cab to go to the airport to fly to Hong Kong, Andrew thought up the guitar riff for &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;. He told the cab driver to wait a couple of minutes while he went back to his motel room to grab something, when in fact, he went back to record the riff on a cassette. The cab driver was furious when Andrew returned to the cab forty-five minutes later. When Hutchence heard the demo in Hong Kong, he wrote the song&#x27;s lyrics, writing most in just ten minutes.

At the end of their two-week seclusion in Hong Kong, Hutchence and Andrew returned to the recording sessions in Australia with a handful of demo tapes, including &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, &quot;Kick&quot; and &quot;Calling All Nations&quot;. Thomas knew the album was done when he heard the recordings, and organised the last portion of the album&#x27;s production to be carried out at the Studio De La Grande Armee in Paris.

While &quot;Kick&quot; had been considered as the album&#x27;s name during the recording sessions in Australia, when the word appeared in a couple of tracks, a song of the same name was written in Hong Kong and it was chosen for certain. There was also the appeal that the word had four letters like the band&#x27;s name.
Certain songs that were recorded early in production remained close to their demo counterparts, while others were changed drastically. Originally, &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; was a piano ballad having no orchestral structure at all. The song&#x27;s original arrangement was released on &quot;Kick 25&quot;, the 25th anniversary reissue. The demo of &quot;Mediate&quot; was also longer. When Andrew first played its demo in the studio, &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; was playing in the background. Upon hearing both tracks being played simultaneously, Nicholas labored to have the two tracks combined. Nicholas said in the band&#x27;s official autobiography, &quot;I rewound his tape and hit play just as &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; ended and synced up so perfectly that I actually thought something was wrong&quot;.

The members of INXS spent the final &quot;Kick&quot; sessions contributing their talents on Richard Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Glory Road&quot;, which was being produced in the same studio.

==Music and lyrics==
With &quot;Kick&quot;, Thomas fused the funk and soul of &quot;The Swing&quot; with the mainstream rock of &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;. In an interview with MusicRadar, Andrew Farriss stated, &quot;The melding of funk and rock was always in our heads. We were very excited about the idea of overlaying two types of songs and genres together.&quot;

The success of their single &quot;What You Need&quot; provided primary songwriters Hutchence and Andrew Farriss with the confidence and optimism to pen bigger material, and with the rest of the band&#x27;s blessing, &quot;Kick&quot; became the first INXS album written by the duo without input from the other members. When it came time to write and record, the band set out to make an album that did not share any musical formula with other hits of the time. According to Andrew Farriss, &quot;Anyone can write a song that sounds contemporary. We wanted our songs to sound like the future&quot;.

Andrew Farriss recalls, &quot;Hutchence&#x27;s instrument was his voice; he couldn&#x27;t explain what he was thinking in musical terms. He would say things like, &#x27;It needs to feel like this.&#x27; And I&#x27;d try to translate that into notes&quot;.

Upon its release, &quot;Kick&quot; was noted for being in sync with the visual media of the late 80&#x27;s, which is instantly evident in the album&#x27;s opening track &quot;Guns in the Sky&quot;; the song described the state of the world and its obsession with arms. The rest of the album focuses on themes of fun, love and excess; &quot;New Sensation&quot; and &quot;Calling All Nations&quot; are both about a party lifestyle, while &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; describes an instant connection between two people who form an unending bond. The lyrics to &quot;Devil Inside&quot; are about a life of excess. The sequencing of &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; and &quot;Mediate&quot; provides a lyrical contrast, as the former exudes intimacy while the latter addresses social concerns like apartheid. The band also included a new version of &quot;The Loved One&quot;, a song by Australian rock band The Loved Ones they had previously covered in their compilation &quot;INXSIVE&quot; (1982).

==Release==

In the band&#x27;s 2005 official autobiography, the band&#x27;s manager Chris Murphy stated that upon completion of &quot;Kick&quot;, he flew to New York to play the finished album for the top executives of Atlantic Records. The US record label first rejected the album, feeling that the funk and dance elements would alienate the band&#x27;s traditional rock following. Murphy said that he resisted Atlantic&#x27;s proposition of one million dollars to produce the album all over again. He then devised a strategy to get &quot;Kick&quot; released.

Unbeknownst to Atlantic, Murphy arranged a secret meeting with the staff of Atlantic&#x27;s radio promotion division to play them &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;. He found a market when the head of college radio promotion agreed to concentrate a strategy on campus radio. The song was a chart success on the radio network and received heavy replay. &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; was released in September 1987. Murphy stated that his strategy had worked. Atlantic added &quot;Kick&quot; to their release schedule for October.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Devil Inside&quot;, crossed over onto album rock play lists. Over the course of four consecutive top five singles and the support of a short college tour, with INXS playing concerts in college bars and university auditoriums across North America, &quot;Kick&quot; became popular among American fans.

==Tour==
Following the release of &quot;Kick&quot;, INXS embarked on a sixteen-month global tour playing arenas and stadiums in major cities across North America, Europe, Japan and Australia. The band started off their Kick tour on 14 August with a number of secret warm-up shows being played across south-eastern and north-eastern Australia, before setting off on a three leg tour of the US beginning in East Lansing on 16 September. The first American leg ran right through to November, followed by UK dates in December.

With the growing popularity of &quot;Kick&quot;, and the release of its first single, &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, all twelve songs from the album quickly became staples of the tour&#x27;s setlists, with &quot;Don&#x27;t Change&quot; being regularly played during a show&#x27;s encore.

The tour resumed in March with the band playing three sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall in New York City from 18 to 20 March. Fleets of trucks were hired to transport the band&#x27;s equipment, lighting and wardrobe across thousands of miles of road over the next three months. During the band&#x27;s time spent commuting across America, Andrew began writing and playing new material with a guitar. According to &quot;INXS: The Official Inside Story of a Band on the Road&quot;, Andrew said, &quot;Prior to the Kick tour I&#x27;d never written on the road – mainly because I didn&#x27;t have time I guess. But with &quot;Kick&quot; I started writing with a guitar, and I was kind of proud that I&#x27;d taught myself to do that&quot;. INXS finished up the second leg of the American tour with a handful of shows being played in key cities across the California state, including San Francisco, Fresno and San Diego.

In October, INXS made a brief stopover in Japan to play a small number of shows and festivals in Tokyo and Yokohama, before flying on to Australia to finish the last segment of the Calling All Nations tour. Since the culmination of the tour in November 1988, INXS agreed to a one-year respite. This one-year break allowed the members time off to spend with their families and to work on side projects.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey retrospectively described the album as &quot;an impeccably crafted pop &quot;tour de force&quot;, the band succeeding at everything they try&quot;. He added, &quot;More to the point, every song is catchy and memorable, branded with indelible hooks&quot;. According to Huey, &quot;&quot;Kick&quot; crystallized all of the band&#x27;s influences – stones-y rock &amp; roll, pop, funk, contemporary dance-pop – into a cool, stylish dance/rock hybrid.&quot;

Robert Christgau called INXS &quot;silly middlebrow hacks&quot;, but acknowledged that &quot;Kick&quot; delivered &quot;danceable rock and roll that sounds smart in the background&quot;. Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, asserted that &quot;Kick&quot; &quot;became the band&#x27;s most enduring release by mixing the hard rock sound of &quot;Thieves&quot; with a looser approach to dance grooves&quot;. In a retrospective review, &quot;Q&quot; wrote, &quot;Hutchence&#x27;s knowing, Jaggeresque vocal swagger turned &#x27;Devil Inside,&#x27; &#x27;Never Tear Us Apart&#x27; and the mighty &#x27;Mystify&#x27; into something beyond what INXS had done before and what they would do again&quot;.

BBC Music&#x27;s Cormac Heron reviewed the 2004 deluxe edition, &quot;superfluous second disc notwithstanding, this is a near flawless collection of songs&quot; and felt that the &quot;production still sounds fresh and the song-writing partnership of Hutchence/Farriss wins you over with an anthemic glory&quot;. In a 2012 special review celebrating the anniversary of albums released in 1987, &quot;Classic Album Review&quot; admired &quot;Kick&quot;, calling it a &quot;Well crafted pop/rock/dance album&quot; and stating that it &quot;transformed the band from the status of an alternative niche to that of a mainstream pop headliner&quot;.

Nick Launay, producer of the band&#x27;s fourth studio album noted, &quot;They&#x27;d lean more toward funk on &quot;The Swing&quot; and then they&#x27;d lean toward rock on Thieves to make it in America. By the time &quot;Kick&quot; came around, it was time to lean toward funk again. When I heard that album, I thought, wow, they got it right&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Kick&quot; provided the band with worldwide popularity; it peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 9 in the UK and No. 15 in Austria. In the US, the album spent a total of 79 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, staying 22 consecutive weeks in the top 10. It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 US singles, &quot;New Sensation&quot;, &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot;, &quot;Devil Inside&quot; and the No. 1 &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;. In Canada, the album debuted at number 14 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Albums Chart on 5 December 1987. It reached the top of the charts on 14 May 1988 and remained there for 1 week. The album&#x27;s biggest single &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the UK charts, No. 3 in Australia, and No. 10 in France.

Within a year of its release, &quot;Kick&quot; had achieved gold and platinum status in many countries. In the United States, the album was certified platinum on 22 December 1987, less than two months after its release, by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for sales of one million copies. By the end of 1989, it was certified quadruple platinum, having sold in excess of four million units in the United States alone. &quot;Kick&quot; remains the band&#x27;s best-selling album in Canada, earning a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), for shipments of one million copies. In the UK, &quot;Kick&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to attain a platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), achieving this designation in July 1988. 

&quot;Kick&quot; was a commercial success in other territories across Europe, earning platinum accreditations in France, Spain and Switzerland. At the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards, the band was both the most-nominated and most-awarded artist at the show, winning five of their nine nominations, including the awards for Video of the Year and Viewer&#x27;s Choice for &quot;Need You Tonight/Mediate&quot;. The video for &quot;Mediate&quot;, which played after &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, replicated the format of Bob Dylan&#x27;s video for &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. This marked the first of a few instances in VMA history where the same artist and music video won both awards at the same ceremony.

==Legacy==
&quot;Kick&quot; is the band&#x27;s best-selling album, with reported sales approaching 20 million worldwide as of 2012. According to the band&#x27;s official autobiography, the album sold nearly 10 million units internationally only two years after its release. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified &quot;Kick&quot; as six times Platinum, with shipments of six million units, in 1997. In Canada, &quot;Kick&quot; is the second album by an Australian act to receive a diamond accreditation, the first being AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black&quot;. &quot;Kick&quot; remains the band&#x27;s best selling album in the UK, having gone three times platinum in 1989, with over 1 million units sold. In the band&#x27;s native Australia, &quot;Kick&quot; has gone seven times platinum, marking just over 500,000 in sales. 27 years after its release, &quot;Kick&quot; re-entered the Australian and New Zealand charts where it peaked again at No.2 in Australia and No.11 in New Zealand.

The album has been lauded by critics the world over as a work of &quot;rhythm rock&quot; perfection, and has made its way onto many &quot;best of&quot; lists; in their 1988 issue of &quot;Best Albums of the Year&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers allocated &quot;Kick&quot; at number 3. Two years later, the magazine ranked the album at number 11 in their 1990 Australian issue of &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the 80s&quot;. 

The album achieved the same ranking on ABC&#x27;s (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) list of &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;, a compendium compiled by Australian journalists John O’Donnell, Toby Creswell and Craig Mathieson. &quot;Kick&quot; was listed at number 5 in a similar list of &quot;Hottest 100 Australian Albums of all time&quot;. &quot;Slicing Up Eyeballs&quot; ranked &quot;Kick&quot; at number 6 in their 2013 list of &quot;Top 100 Albums of 1987&quot;. VH1 placed the album&#x27;s biggest single &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; at number 16 on its list of &quot;Top 100 songs of the 80&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; also listed the song at number 5 on their list of &quot;20 Sexiest Songs of All Time&quot;. In December 2021, the album was listed at number two in Rolling Stone Australia’s ‘200 Greatest Albums of All Time’ countdown.

==Reissues==
In 1989, a special edition of &quot;Kick&quot; was released in Japan through WEA, featuring six additional tracks: the b-sides &quot;Move On&quot; and &quot;Different World&quot;, and four remixes of the songs &quot;Devil Inside&quot;, &quot;New Sensation&quot;, &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; and &quot;Guns in the Sky&quot;.

&quot;Kick&quot; was first re-issued in 2002 by Rhino Entertainment as a remastered version. This expanded release included four previously unreleased bonus tracks: a bonus demo of &quot;Mystify&quot;, as well as the demos &quot;Jesus Was a Man&quot; and &quot;The Trap&quot;. It also features a guitar version of the b-side &quot;Move On&quot;, which is one minute shorter and features a number of removed lyrics. Mercury/Universal reissued the album in 2004 as part of their Deluxe Edition series of albums. This two-disc collection was exclusive to the UK only and featured two b-sides: &quot;I&#x27;m Coming (Home)&quot; and &quot;On the Rocks&quot;, as well as three live tracks recorded during the band&#x27;s Kick tour in America.

===&quot;Kick 25&quot;===
In July 2012, Universal Music Group announced that &quot;Kick&quot; would be re-issued in various formats to celebrate the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary. This marked the third time the album has been expanded since its initial release. Although the announcement was not officially confirmed on the band&#x27;s website, track listings for the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary began appearing on various UK retail websites via Mercury Records, with release dates set in the fall of 2012. INXS confirmed the news on their website a few days after the announcement by Universal Music Group. It was later reported by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; that a DVD would be included in the collection, featuring brand new video clips of Hutchence, as well as never before seen handwritten lyrics, sourced directly from the singer&#x27;s family archives. The band&#x27;s manager stated, &quot;It&#x27;ll be an amazing, super-duper package. There&#x27;s stuff that was recorded with Michael for &quot;Kick&quot; that didn&#x27;t go on the album&quot;.

Various formats of &quot;Kick&quot; were simultaneously released on 12 September 2012: a deluxe edition, a super deluxe edition, two digital editions available for download and a limited-edition red-vinyl release. Each format includes the original &quot;Kick&quot; album remastered, with all of the bonus tracks from the 2002 Rhino expanded release and the 2004 Mercury UK deluxe set. The deluxe edition, a two-disc set, includes b-sides, remixes, demos and live performances on the second disc. The super deluxe edition comes in a ten-inch square slipcase, with an 84-page hard back book inside, a red disc wallet for the four discs (three CD&#x27;s and 1 DVD), an original tour poster and a &quot;Kick&quot; sticker sheet. The book features unseen photos, interviews and never before seen lyrics penned by Hutchence. The DVD offers video footage from the band&#x27;s Calling All Nations world tour, promo videos, and a brand new documentary titled &#x27;Track Baby Track&#x27;, featuring clips and interviews about the making of the album.

===&quot;Kick 30&quot;===
In October 2017, Universal Music Group announced that &quot;Kick&quot; would be re-issued in various formats to celebrate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, which features a 3CD+Blu-ray, 2LP Vinyl Edition (half-speed mastered and pressed at 45RPM) and digital version.

The album is newly remastered with a Dolby Atmos new surround mix created by Giles Martin. New additions include &quot;Guns in the Sky (Kookaburra Mix), &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; (Ben Liebrand Mix), &quot;Need You Tonight (Mendelsohn 7″ Edit)&quot; and more. A Blu-ray featuring the music in Dolby Atmos was included on the Blu-ray version.

<text>Frontier is an unincorporated community in Hillsdale County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Woodbridge Township.

As an unincorporated community, Frontier has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 49239 ZIP Code, which is primarily used for post office box services.

==Geography== 

Frontier is located in northeastern Woodbridge Township in southern Hillsdale County about south of the city of Jackson. The community is about north of the state border with Ohio near the southernmost point in the state of Michigan.

The nearest city is Hillsdale about to the north, while nearby villages include Montgomery to the west, Camden to the southwest, Reading to the northwest, and Waldon to the southeast. The Ohio village of Pioneer is located to the south. Other nearby unincorporated communities include Ransom to the east, Cambria to the northwest, Shadyside and Fountain Park to the northeast, and Austin to the southwest. Frontier is not served by any major highways, rail lines, or airports, although M-99 runs south–north about east of the community and is accessible via East Montgomery Road.

The community is served by Camden–Frontier Schools to the south in Amboy Township. The Woodbridge Township government office and fire department are located in the western portion of the community along East Montgomery Road.

The Frontier post office is located at 2342 East Montgomery Road in the center of the community. The post office uses the 49258 ZIP Code, which is primarily used for post office box services. For delivery, the surrounded area is served by the Hillsdale 49242 ZIP Code, while areas to the southwest may use the Camden 49232 ZIP Code.

==History==
The area was first settled by the William Saxton family in 1834, which was one year before Hillsdale County was officially organized in the Michigan Territory. Saxton was originally from Canandaigua, New York and moved to Michigan, first residing in Raisin Township in Lenawee County. He purchased from the government, built his log cabin, and settled in the undeveloped region with his family. Other settlers and family members moved to the area in the next few years. By 1839, several families now lived in the area, and Woodbridge Township itself was established in 1840.

The community became known as Frontier when it was organized in 1851. It was named Frontier, as it was the last Michigan settlement before reaching the Ohio state line. In 1855, residents of the community built the Woodbridge Township Hall at a total cost of $260. A post office began operating here on January 30, 1857 with Benjamin Duealer serving as the first postmaster. The post office closed soon after on August 6, 1858 but was restored on November 9, 1861. The post office has remained in operation ever since, and the current post office was built in 1869. In an 1857 map of Hillsdale County, the Saxton and Duealer homesteads, among other families, can be seen in section 12 in the northeast portion of Woodbridge Township. Frontier developed as a station along the route between Amboy going north to Hillsdale.

The name Frontier appeared on an 1872 map of Woodbridge Township. By this time, Frontier&#x27;s first settler, William Saxton, had left the area and moved to Iowa. By 1879, the community had a population of around 150 and contained two general stores, a sawmill, stave factory, and several small mechanic shops. An Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodge was built in Frontier in 1912. Originally served by neighboring fire departments, the township appropriated $10,000 to purchase the lot next to the township hall to build their own fire department in 1957. The fire department now serves areas of several neighboring townships. In 1975, the Woodbridge Township Hall was recognized by the Michigan Townships Association as the oldest operating township hall in the state.

<doc id="1121621" wikidata="Q3790687" url="?curid=1121621" title="Bulge bracket">
<text>Bulge bracket banks are the world&#x27;s largest global investment banks, serving mostly large corporations, institutional investors and governments. The term &quot;Bulge Bracket&quot; comes from the way investment banks are listed on the &quot;tombstone&quot;, or public notification of a financial transaction, where the largest advisors on investment banking operations (mergers, acquisitions, IPOs, or debt issuance) are listed first. The term is primarily related to the financial advisory side of the business, as opposed to sales and trading.

== Overview ==
Bulge bracket banks usually provide both advisory and financing banking services, as well as the sales, market making, and research on a broad array of financial products including equities, credit, rates, commodities and their derivatives. They are also heavily involved in the invention of new financial products, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the 1980s, credit default swaps in the 1990s and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) in the 2000s and today, carbon emission trading and insurance-linked products.

Bulge bracket firms are usually primary dealers in US treasury securities. Bulge bracket banks are also global in the sense that they have a strong presence in all four of the world&#x27;s major regions: the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC).

The name comes from the way investment banks are listed on the &quot;tombstone&quot;, or public notification of a financial transaction; the more important banks in a syndicate are listed first. There is often debate over which banks are considered to belong to the bulge bracket. Various rankings are often cited, such as Bloomberg 20, Mergermarket M&amp;A league tables, or Thomson Reuters league tables, as well as other rankings.

==History==
According to biographer Ron Chernow&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;The House of Morgan&quot;, &quot;in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the top tier—called the bulge bracket—consisted of Morgan Stanley; First Boston; Kuhn, Loeb; and Dillon, Read.&quot; Morgan Stanley appeared above the other members of the bulge bracket by demanding and receiving the role of syndicate manager. While order within brackets was otherwise determined alphabetically, Chernow describes this positioning as being of &quot;life-and-death&quot; importance to the firms. Chernow says that Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Incorporated&#x27;s name was chosen based on a desire to be placed as high as possible within its bracket.

According to Chernow, Morgan Stanley &quot;queasily noted the rise of Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs, which were using their trading skills to chip away at the four dominant firms.&quot; In 1975, to more reflect economic reality, Morgan Stanley removed Kuhn, Loeb and Dillon, Read, and replaced them with Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Chernow describes&#x27; Morgan Stanley&#x27;s place at the top of the bracket as a &quot;gilded anachronism&quot; by the late 1970s.

By the 1980s a revised bulge bracket had been defined. &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1987 reported that

In the 1990s, the dominance of the bulge bracket firms was globalizing. In 2001 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;The real battle for the bulge bracket is taking place in Europe.&quot;

== Modern list ==
In 2020, the Corporate Finance Institute, a Canadian financial analyst certification organization, and Wall Street Oasis, an online investment banking and finance forum, listed ten investment banks as part of the bulge bracket category. Investopedia in 2022 listed the same banks. , there are nine bulge bracket banks, following the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS.
* JPMorgan Chase
* Bank of America
* Goldman Sachs
* Morgan Stanley
* Barclays
* Deutsche Bank
* UBS
* Citigroup

==Other uses==
By extension, members of the international business community sometimes refer to leading business services providers as &quot;bulge bracket&quot;. For example, this term has been used to describe a group of global, highly prestigious law firms with deep expertise across a broad range of topics. However, these firms are more frequently referred to as the Magic Circle (law firms) and Silver Circle (law firms). Similarly, &quot;bulge bracket&quot; has sometimes been used to describe the Big Three (management consultancies) (or alternatively &quot;MBB&quot;) or the Big Four accounting firms due to their global reach and strong reputations in consulting and accounting services, respectively.

<text>Graeme Hunter Kelling (4 April 1957 – 10 June 2004) was a Scottish musician and the original guitarist with the Scottish pop band, Deacon Blue.

Born in Paisley, Scotland, Kelling was brought up in Mount Vernon in the East End of Glasgow, and educated at the High School of Glasgow. Born into the Plymouth Brethren sect, he turned away from it in order to travel and to follow music. In the early 1980s, he worked in the Glasgow rock music scene as both bandmember (Tune Cookies, On a Clear Day, Precious, and The Painted Word) and session guitarist. Having joined Deacon Blue in 1984 (while the band was still called Dr Love), Kelling went on to co-write their 1987 single &quot;Loaded&quot; and the B-side &quot;Ronnie Spector&quot; (the latter from the second single release of &quot;Dignity&quot;). He played on the first four Deacon Blue albums – &quot;Raintown&quot;, &quot;When the World Knows Your Name&quot;, &quot;Fellow Hoodlums&quot; and &quot;Whatever You Say, Say Nothing&quot; – before the band&#x27;s first split in 1994.
Following the end of his first stint with Deacon Blue, Kelling ran a recording studio and wrote soundtrack and incidental music for film and television. He also took on work as a prose writer, contributing restaurant reviews to &quot;The List&quot; and travel writing to Peter Irvine&#x27;s guide book &quot;Scotland the Best&quot;. Kelling rejoined Deacon Blue in May 1999, and despite being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer early in 2000, continued working with the band for the next five years (contributing to the albums &quot;Walking Back Home&quot; and &quot;Homesick&quot;).

Kelling died in 2004 in Glasgow, at the age of 47. He was survived by his wife (television producer Julie Smith) and two children, Alexander and Grace.

<text>Key Denson Pittman (September 19, 1872 – November 10, 1940) was a United States senator from Nevada and a member of the Democratic Party, serving eventually as president pro tempore as well as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Pittman was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi on September 12, 1872, a son of William Buckner Pittman and Katherine Key Pittman. His siblings included a younger brother, Vail M. Pittman, who served as Governor of Nevada.

Key Pittman was educated by private tutors and at the Southwestern Presbyterian University in Clarksville, Tennessee. He studied law, then later was admitted to the bar. In 1897, Pittman joined in the Klondike Gold Rush and worked as a miner until 1901.

Pittman moved to Tonopah, Nevada, in 1902 and continued the practice of law. He represented Nevada at the St. Louis Exposition, the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, and the National Irrigation Congress.

===Political career===
In the early 20th century, Nevada was one of several states that hoped to institute the popular election of United States senators; the U.S. Constitution had provided for them to be elected by state legislatures. The states aiming to change this held popular elections as Senate terms expired, with the goal of forcing their legislatures to elect the people&#x27;s choices. This was almost certainly unconstitutional, but the matter never reached the U.S. Supreme Court before the 17th Amendment became part of the Constitution.

Nevada held a popular vote for the Senate in 1910, in which Pittman was the Democratic nominee; he lost to Republican incumbent George S. Nixon. After Nixon died on June 5, 1912, Pittman faced Republican interim appointee William A. Massey in a special election that November. Pittman won the election and, as happened in all of these questionable Senate elections held prior to the adoption of the 17th Amendment, the Nevada Legislature made the popular result official. The 17th Amendment was ratified in 1913 and Pittman won full terms in 1916, 1922, 1928, and 1934; he was re-elected again in 1940 but died shortly after the election.

Between 1933 and 1940, during the Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Pittman was the chairman of the powerful Committee on Foreign Relations and a member of the Committee on Territories and the Committee on Industrial Expositions. In addition, during those years Pittman was also President pro tempore of the United States Senate.

Among his legislation is the Pittman–Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937, which set up a formula for federal sharing of ammunition tax revenue for establishing state wildlife areas. The program is still in effect. The Key Pittman Wildlife Management Area near Hiko, Nevada, which encompasses the Frenchy and Nesbitt lakes, is named in his honor.

===Death and legacy===
It was falsely rumored for years that Pittman died before his final election in 1940, and that Democratic party leaders kept the body at Tonopah&#x27;s Mizpah Hotel in a bathtub full of ice until after he was reelected so Governor Edward P. Carville, a fellow Democrat, could appoint a replacement. The truth was, former Nevada State Archivist Guy Rocha wrote, &quot;just as disreputable.&quot; Pittman suffered a severe heart attack just before the election on November 5, and two doctors told his aides before the election that death was imminent. To avoid affecting the election, the party told the press that the senator was hospitalized for exhaustion and that his condition was not serious. Pittman died on November 10 at the Washoe General Hospital in Reno, Nevada.

Several pieces of legislation bore his name, including the Pittman Act of 1918 and the Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937.

The Pittman section of the Alaska Railroad, more commonly known today as the community of Meadow Lakes west of Wasilla, was also named for him. Pittman Road runs north from its intersection with the George Parks Highway at &quot;downtown&quot; Meadow Lakes.

A section of the city Henderson, Nevada is unofficially known as Pittman. There is also a natural wash that traverses a large section of Henderson named after the former senator. It is known as the Pittman Wash and has a walking / biking trail alongside it.

In 1941, his wife donated Pittman&#x27;s papers to the Library of Congress. She temporarily withdrew them in 1942. They were returned to the Library by the Gates family in 1954.

<text>William Pitt the Younger led the government of the Kingdom of Great Britain from 1783 to 1801.

In 1800, the Acts of Union between Great Britain and Ireland were accepted by their respective parliaments, creating the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (UK), which would be governed by the former Parliament of Great Britain (now the UK Parliament). Pitt governed this new state for the first month of its existence, until differences with King George III over Catholic emancipation caused him to resign.

<text>Crest of a Knave is the sixteenth studio album by British rock band Jethro Tull, released in 1987. The album was recorded after a three-year hiatus caused by a throat infection of vocalist Ian Anderson, resulting in his changed singing style. Following the unsuccessful electronic rock album &quot;Under Wraps&quot;, &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; had the band returning to a more hard rock sound. The album was their most successful since the 1970s and the band enjoyed a resurgence on radio broadcasts, appearances in MTV specials and the airing of music videos. It was also a critical success, winning the 1989 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental in what was widely viewed as an upset over the favorite, Metallica&#x27;s &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. The album was supported by &quot;The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour&quot;.

==Production==
Even though Doane Perry had been a member of Jethro Tull since 1984, he only appears on two tracks, with Gerry Conway, who had played on the 1982 album &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot;, playing on four. The remaining three tracks feature a drum machine. Keyboardist Peter-John Vettese had left the band in 1986, and Ian Anderson contributed the synth programming. The album sleeve only lists Anderson, Martin Barre and Dave Pegg as band members. Barre remembers this production as being &quot;the album where a lot of things were of my invention. There are still chunks of the music where lan very much knew what he wanted, but I think my input was far greater on that album than on any other&quot;.

The cover was designed by heraldic artist Andrew Stewart Jamieson. The single &quot;Steel Monkey&quot; had the cover designed by art director John Pasche.

This album was released simultaneously on LP and on CD, but the vinyl edition did not feature the songs &quot;Dogs in the Midwinter&quot; and &quot;The Waking Edge&quot;. Both tracks appeared on vinyl as B-sides to the singles.

The album back cover shows in the credits that the album was &quot;Recorded just round the corner from the kitchen in the room behind the door which used to be painted white but isn&#x27;t any more&quot;. And also: &quot;Martin would like to thank Paul Hamer (Hamer Guitars). Ian and Dave would like to thank almost everybody else.&quot;

==Musical style==
The album relied more heavily on Martin Barre&#x27;s electric guitar than the band had since the 1970s. The style of &quot;Crest&quot; has been compared to that of Dire Straits, in part because Anderson no longer had the vocal range he once possessed (the result of recent throat surgery).

Ian Anderson later stated about the musical style of the album: &quot;&#x27;Steel Monkey&#x27; was based around a sequencer riff, and it didn&#x27;t have any flute in it. So it was yet another atypical Jethro Tull song that was a radio hit. By comparison, both &#x27;Farm On The Freeway&#x27; and &#x27;Budapest&#x27; are very typical Tull songs. &#x27;Budapest&#x27; is the kind of song I like to write because it embodies a lot of different nuances which I think are subtly joined together. It sort of moves from classical to slightly bluesy to folk, and it just slips between them and you don&#x27;t see the stitching.&quot;

==Themes==
&quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; explores various themes in its lyrics, as Anderson often does. The song &quot;She Said She Was a Dancer&quot; shows that Tull&#x27;s frank treatment of sexuality was unabated. The album contains the popular live song &quot;Budapest&quot;, which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. &quot;Farm on the Freeway&quot; on the other hand profiles a farmer who has lost his land through eminent domain, and who now possesses only his truck. &quot;Mountain Men&quot; became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa and the Falklands War. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of El Alamein (WW II) and also South America (1982), drawing historic parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Sounds&quot;&#x27; review was mixed. It recognized the quality and even called the opening tracks &quot;Steel Monkey&quot; and &quot;Farm on the Freeway&quot; &quot;stunners&quot;. The overall evaluation was that: &quot;In a shrewd move, Ian Anderson has studied the current heavy metal renewal and adapted it to suit his own ends, and the results are impressive to say the least&quot;. Although in the end, comparing the album with the style of Mark Knopfler, the review would go on to say that: &quot;But in his efforts to stay &#x27;hip&#x27;, the hairy progressive rock guru has fallen prey not just to the influence of modern pop&#x27;s more inspiring aspects but also to its foulest evils: the rank odour of Mark Knopfler pervades the remainder of &#x27;Crest...&#x27; […] Shamefully and cruelly, the album is snuffed out. It&#x27;s a pity, in all seriousness&quot;.

Although contemporarily well-accepted, AllMusic&#x27;s later review was a little more committed, calling the album their best since &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;, but also stating: &quot;Truth is, it isn&#x27;t a bad album, with an opening track that qualifies as hard rock and pretty much shouts its credentials out in Martin Barre&#x27;s screaming lead guitar line, present throughout. &quot;Jump Start&quot; and &quot;Raising Steam&quot; also rock hard, and no one can complain of too much on this record being soft, apart from the acoustic &quot;The Waking Edge,&quot; along with &quot;Budapest&quot; and &quot;Said She Was a Dancer,&quot; Anderson&#x27;s two ageing rock-star&#x27;s-eye-view accounts of meeting women from around the world. The antiwar song &quot;Mountain Men&quot; is classic Tull-styled electric folk, all screaming electric guitars at a pretty high volume by its end&quot;.

==Grammy controversy==
&quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; won the 1989 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental, beating the heavily favoured &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; by Metallica and critics&#x27; choice &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; by Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

The Grammy award was controversial as many did not consider the album or Jethro Tull to be hard rock, much less heavy metal. Under advisement from their manager, no one from the band turned up to the award ceremony, as they were told that they had no chance of winning. In response to the controversy, the band&#x27;s record label Chrysalis took out an advert in a British music periodical with the line, &quot;The flute is a heavy, metal instrument!&quot; The Grammy award was split into two categories and renamed after the event.

In 2007, the win was named one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the Grammy Award as the 18th &quot;Most Awesomely Retro Moments in Grammy History&quot;.

In 1992, Metallica won the Grammy for Best Heavy Metal album, for their 1991 self-titled album. During the band&#x27;s acceptance speech, drummer Lars Ulrich said &quot;We would personally like to thank Jethro Tull for not releasing an album this year!&quot; However, Jethro Tull did release the album &quot;Catfish Rising&quot; in 1991.

<text>In mathematics, the axiom of real determinacy (abbreviated as ADR) is an axiom in set theory. It states the following:

The axiom of real determinacy is a stronger version of the axiom of determinacy (AD), which makes the same statement about games where both players choose integers; ADR is inconsistent with the axiom of choice. It also implies the existence of inner models with certain large cardinals.

ADR is equivalent to AD plus the axiom of uniformization.

<doc id="1121651" wikidata="Q1195783" url="?curid=1121651" title="Man and Technics">
<text>Man and Technics: A Contribution to a Philosophy of Life () is a 1931 book by Oswald Spengler, in which the author discusses a critique of technology and industrialism and uses the Nietzschean concept of the will to power to understand man&#x27;s nature.

Building on his previous ideas in &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;, Spengler argues that many of the Western world&#x27;s great achievements may soon become spectacles for our descendants to marvel at, as we do with the pyramids of Egypt or the baths of Rome. He points in particular to the tendency of Western technology to spread to hostile &quot;colored races&quot; which would then use the weapons against the West. In Spengler&#x27;s view, western culture will be destroyed from within by materialism, and destroyed by others through economic competition and warfare. 

The book ends in the famous passage, indicating that to Faustian man:&quot;[a]lready the danger is so great, for every individual, every class, every people, that to cherish any illusion whatever is deplorable. Time does not suffer itself to be halted; there is no question of prudent retreat or wise renunciation. Only dreamers believe that there is a way out. Optimism is cowardice.We are born into this time and must bravely follow the path to the destined end. There is no other way. Our duty is to hold on to the lost position, without hope, without rescue, like that Roman soldier whose bones were found in front of a door in Pompeii, who, during the eruption of Vesuvius, died at his post because they forgot to relieve him. That is greatness. That is what it means to be a thoroughbred. The honourable end is the one thing that can not be taken from a man.&quot;

<doc id="1121653" wikidata="Q935969" url="?curid=1121653" title="Freddie Mac">
<text>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), commonly known as Freddie Mac, is an American publicly traded, government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), headquartered in Tysons, Virginia. The FHLMC was created in 1970 to expand the secondary market for mortgages in the US. Along with its sister organization, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Freddie Mac buys mortgages, pools them, and sells them as a mortgage-backed security (MBS) to private investors on the open market. This secondary mortgage market increases the supply of money available for mortgage lending and increases the money available for new home purchases. The name &quot;Freddie Mac&quot; is a variant of the FHLMC initialism of the company&#x27;s full name that was adopted officially for ease of identification.

On September 7, 2008, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director James B. Lockhart III announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA (see Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). The action has been described as &quot;one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades&quot;. As of the start of the conservatorship, the United States Department of the Treasury had contracted to acquire US$1 billion in Freddie Mac senior preferred stock, paying at a rate of 10% per year, and the total investment may subsequently rise to as much as US$100 billion. Shares of Freddie Mac stock, however, plummeted to about one U.S. dollar on September 8, 2008, and dropped a further 50% on June 16, 2010, when the stocks delisted due to falling below minimum share prices for the NYSE. In 2008, the yield on U.S Treasury securities rose in anticipation of increased U.S. federal debt. The housing market and economy eventually recovered, making Freddie Mac profitable once again.

Freddie Mac is ranked No. 45 on the 2023 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue, and has $3.208 trillion in assets under management.

==History==
From 1938 to 1968, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) was the sole institution that bought mortgages from depository institutions, principally savings and loan associations, which encouraged more mortgage lending and effectively insured the value of mortgages by the US government. In 1968, Fannie Mae split into a private corporation and a publicly financed institution. The private corporation was still called Fannie Mae and its charter continued to support the purchase of mortgages from savings and loan associations and other depository institutions, but without an &quot;explicit&quot; insurance policy that guaranteed the value of the mortgages. The publicly financed institution was named the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) and it explicitly guaranteed the repayments of securities backed by mortgages made to government employees or veterans (the mortgages themselves were also guaranteed by other government organizations).

To provide competition for the newly private Fannie Mae and to further increase the availability of funds to finance mortgages and home ownership, Congress then established the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) as a private corporation through the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970. The charter of Freddie Mac was essentially the same as Fannie Mae&#x27;s newly private charter: to expand the secondary market for mortgages and mortgage-backed securities by buying mortgages made by savings and loan associations and other depository institutions. Initially, Freddie Mac was owned by the twelve Federal Home Loan Banks and governed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

In 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (&quot;FIRREA&quot;) revised and standardized the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It also severed Freddie Mac&#x27;s ties to the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) was abolished and replaced by different and separate entities. An 18-member board of directors for Freddie Mac was formed, and subjected to oversight by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Separately, The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) was created as an independent agency to take the place of the FHLBB, to oversee the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (also called district banks).

In 1995, Freddie Mac began receiving affordable housing credit for buying subprime securities, and by 2004, HUD suggested the company was lagging behind and should &quot;do more&quot;.

Freddie Mac was put under a conservatorship of the U.S. federal government on Sunday, September 7, 2008.

==Business==
Freddie Mac&#x27;s primary method of making money is by charging a guarantee fee on loans that it has purchased and securitized into mortgage-backed security (MBS) bonds. Investors, or purchasers of Freddie Mac MBS, are willing to let Freddie Mac keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk. That is, Freddie Mac guarantees that the principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid back regardless of whether the borrower actually repays. Owing to Freddie Mac&#x27;s financial guarantee, these MBS are particularly attractive to investors and, like other Agency MBS, are eligible to be traded in the &quot;to-be-announced&quot;, or &quot;TBA&quot; market.

=== Conforming loans ===
The GSEs are allowed to buy only conforming loans, which limits secondary market demand for non-conforming loans. The relationship between supply and demand typically renders the non-conforming loan harder to sell (fewer competing buyers); thus it would cost the consumer more (typically 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point, and sometimes more, depending on credit market conditions). OFHEO, now merged into the new FHFA, annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan in response to the October to October change in mean home price. Above the conforming loan limit, a mortgage is considered a jumbo loan. The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in such high-cost areas as Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the US Virgin Islands, and is also higher for 2–4 unit properties on a graduating scale. Modifications to these limits were made temporarily to respond to the housing crisis, see jumbo loan for recent events.

===Guarantees and subsidies===

====No actual government guarantees====
The FHLMC states, &quot;securities, including any interest, are not guaranteed by, and are not debts or obligations of, the United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States other than Freddie Mac.&quot; The FHLMC and FHLMC securities are not funded or protected by the US Government. FHLMC securities carry no government guarantee of being repaid. This is explicitly stated in the law that authorizes GSEs, on the securities themselves, and in public communications issued by the FHLMC.

====Assumed guarantees====
There is a widespread belief that FHLMC securities are backed by some sort of implied federal guarantee and a majority of investors believe that the government would prevent a disastrous default. Vernon L. Smith, 2002 Nobel Laureate in economics, has called FHLMC and FNMA &quot;implicitly taxpayer-backed agencies&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; has referred to &quot;the implicit government guarantee&quot; of FHLMC and FNMA.

The then director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dan L. Crippen, testified before Congress in 2001, that the &quot;debt and mortgage-backed securities of GSEs are more valuable to investors than similar private securities because of the perception of a government guarantee.&quot;

====Federal subsidies====

The FHLMC receives no direct federal government aid. However, the corporation and the securities it issues are thought to benefit from government subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office writes, &quot;There have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies. But in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises. Government-sponsored enterprises are costly to the government and taxpayers. The benefit is currently worth $6.5 billion annually.&quot;

===The mortgage crisis from late 2007===
As mortgage originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators. Competition between the GSEs and private securitizers for loans further undermined GSEs power and strengthened mortgage originators. This contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis.

Investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk. Whereas the GSEs guaranteed the performance of their MBS, private securitizers generally did not, and might only retain a thin slice of risk. Additionally, Freddie Mac was bound by underwriting guidelines, limiting them to only purchasing conforming loans that required certain debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios, in addition to other metrics.

From 2001 to 2003, financial institutions experienced high earnings due to an unprecedented re-financing boom brought about by historically low interest rates. When interest rates eventually rose, financial institutions sought to maintain their elevated earnings levels with a shift toward riskier mortgages and private label MBS distribution. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) securitize. Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), and in the start of a sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards. The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share.

The growth of private-label securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages—particularly with adjustable rate mortgages (ARM)—caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures. As a result, home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages. This depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the GSEs, which back the majority of US mortgages. In July 2008, the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that &quot;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the US housing finance system&quot;. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs&#x27; stock. Despite these efforts, by August 2008, shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had tumbled more than 90% from their one-year prior levels.

===Mortgage rate survey===

Each week Freddie Mac publishes a national average of mortgage rates called the Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS). The PMMS tracks a constant borrower profile of conventional, conforming fully-amortizing home purchase loans with 20% down and excellent credit borrowers. Rates are published for the most popular mortgage products, the 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate. Rates are released each week on Thursdays.
The PMMS began in April 1971 with the 30-year fixed-rate average and the 1-year ARM and 15-year fixed-rate products were added in 1984 and 1991 respectively. In January 2005, the 5/1 hybrid ARM was added and it was discontinued in November 2022. In January 2016, the 1-year ARM was discontinued.
Prior to November 2022, the PMMS collected data by surveying lenders across a proportional mix of lending institutions. Following challenges using a traditional survey approach, Freddie Mac transitioned to replacing lender survey responses with actual loan application data submitted by lenders to Freddie Mac&#x27;s automated underwriting system.
 Data is collected from the previous Thursday until the Wednesday before the publication date.
Changes in PMMS rates are widely reported in national media.

===Investigations===
In 2003, Freddie Mac revealed that it had understated earnings by almost $5 billion, one of the largest corporate restatements in U.S. history. As a result, in November, it was fined $125 million—an amount called &quot;peanuts&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

On April 18, 2006, Freddie Mac was fined $3.8 million, by far the largest amount ever assessed by the Federal Election Commission, as a result of illegal campaign contributions. Freddie Mac was accused of illegally using corporate resources between 2000 and 2003 for 85 fundraisers that collected about $1.7 million for federal candidates. Much of the illegal fund raising benefited members of the House Financial Services Committee, a panel whose decisions can affect Freddie Mac. Notably, Freddie Mac held more than 40 fundraisers for House Financial Services Chairman Michael Oxley (R-OH).

=== Government subsidies and bailout ===
Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac often benefited from an implied guarantee of fitness equivalent to truly federally backed financial groups.

As of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.&#x27;s $12 trillion mortgage market. This made both corporations highly susceptible to the subprime mortgage crisis of that year. Ultimately, in July 2008, the speculation was made reality, when the US government took action to prevent the collapse of both corporations. The US Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve took several steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including extending credit limits, granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks), and potentially allowing the Treasury Department to own stock. This event also renewed calls for stronger regulation of GSEs by the government.

President Bush recommended a significant regulatory overhaul of the housing finance industry in 2003, but many Democrats opposed his plan, fearing that tighter regulation could greatly reduce financing for low-income housing, both low- and high-risk. Bush opposed two other acts of legislation:[1][2] Senate Bill S. 190, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005. The bill was sponsored and introduced in the Senate on January 26, 2005 by Senator Chuck Hagel (R–NE) and co-sponsored by Senators Elizabeth Dole (R–NC) and John Sununu (R–NH). The S. 190 bill was reported out of the Senate Banking Committee on July 28, 2005, but never voted on by the full Senate.   

On May 23, 2006, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, issued the results of a 27-month-long investigation.

On May 25, 2006, Senator McCain joined as a co-sponsor to the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 (first put forward by Sen. Chuck Hagel) where he pointed out that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#x27;s regulator reported that profits were &quot;illusions deliberately and systematically created by the company&#x27;s senior management&quot;. However, this regulation too met with opposition from both Democrats and Republicans.

===Political connections===
Several executives of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac include Kenneth Duberstein, former Chief of Staff to President Reagan, advisor to John McCain&#x27;s Presidential Campaign in 2000, and President George W. Bush&#x27;s transition team leader (Fannie Mae board member 1998–2007); Franklin Raines, former Budget Director for President Clinton, CEO from 1999 to 2004—statements about his role as an advisor to the Obama presidential campaign have been determined to be false; James Johnson, former aide to Democratic Vice-President Walter Mondale and ex-head of Obama&#x27;s Vice-Presidential Selection Committee, CEO from 1991 to 1998; and Jamie Gorelick, former Deputy Attorney General to President Clinton, and Vice-Chairman from 1998 to 2003. In his position, Johnson earned an estimated $21 million; Raines earned an estimated $90 million; and Gorelick earned an estimated $26 million. Three of these four top executives were also involved in mortgage-related financial scandals.

The top 10 recipients of campaign contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae during the 1989 to 2008 time period include five Republicans and five Democrats. Top recipients of PAC money from these organizations include Roy Blunt (R-MO) $78,500 (total including individuals&#x27; contributions $96,950), Robert Bennett (R-UT) $71,499 (total $107,999), Spencer Bachus (R-AL) $70,500 (total $103,300), and Kit Bond (R-MO) $95,400 (total $64,000). The following Democrats received mostly individual contributions from employees, rather than PAC money: Christopher Dodd, (D-CT) $116,900 (but also $48,000 from the PACs), John Kerry, (D-MA) $109,000 ($2,000 from PACs), Barack Obama, (D-IL) $120,349 (only $6,000 from the PACs), Hillary Clinton, (D-NY) $68,050 (only $8,000 from PACs). John McCain received $21,550 from these GSEs during this time, mostly individual money. Freddie Mac also contributed $250,000 to the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota according to FEC filings. The organizers of the Democratic National Convention have not yet submitted their filings on how much they received from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.

=== Conservatorship ===

On September 7, 2008, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director James B. Lockhart III announced pursuant to the financial analysis, assessments and statutory authority of the FHFA, he had placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA. FHFA has stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company.

The announcement followed reports two days earlier that the Federal government was planning to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and had met with their CEOs on short notice.

The authority of the U.S. Treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to. The July 30, 2008, law enabling expanded regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased the national debt ceiling by US$800 billion, to a total of US$10.7 trillion in anticipation of the potential need for the Treasury to have the flexibility to support the federal home loan banks.

On September 7, 2008, the U.S. government took control of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Daniel Mudd (CEO of Fannie Mae) and Richard Syron (CEO of Freddie Mac) were replaced. Herbert M. Allison, former vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, took over Fannie Mae, and David M. Moffett, former vice chairman of US Bancorp, took over Freddie Mac.

==Related legislation==

On May 8, 2013, Representative Scott Garrett introduced the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill, if it were passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.

<doc id="1121654" wikidata="Q1982538" url="?curid=1121654" title="Rock Island (Jethro Tull album)">
<text>Rock Island is the 17th studio album by the British rock group Jethro Tull, released in 1989. The album continued the hard rock direction the band took on the previous effort, &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; (1987). The line-up now included Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, Dave Pegg and drummer Doane Perry in his first full recording with the band, although he had already been a member of Jethro Tull since 1984. Without a permanent keyboard player, the role was shared by Fairport Convention&#x27;s Maartin Allcock and former Tull member Peter Vettese.

&quot;Rock Island&quot; went Gold in the UK, with good sales also in Germany, where it peaked at No. 5. &quot;Kissing Willie&quot; was a hit on Rock radio, reaching No. 6 on the US Mainstream Rock Chart.

The staging on the 1989 tour supporting &quot;Rock Island&quot; featured projected silhouettes of lithe dancers during &quot;Kissing Willie&quot;, ending with an image that bordered on pornographic. The song &quot;Big Riff and Mando&quot; reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre&#x27;s prized mandolin by a stage-struck fan.

<doc id="1121663" wikidata="Q5535351" url="?curid=1121663" title="Geology of Dorset">
<text>Dorset (or archaically, Dorsetshire) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast. Covering an area of ; it borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The great variation in its landscape owes much to the underlying geology, which includes an almost unbroken sequence of rocks from 200 to 40 million years ago (Mya) and superficial deposits from 2 Mya to the present. In general, the oldest rocks (Early Jurassic) appear in the far west of the county, with the most recent (Eocene) in the far east. Jurassic rocks also underlie the Blackmore Vale and comprise much of the coastal cliff in the west and south of the county; although younger Cretaceous rocks crown some of the highpoints in the west, they are mainly to be found in the centre and east of the county.

Dorset&#x27;s coastline is one of the most visited and studied coastlines in the world because it shows, along the course of (including some of east Devon), rocks from the beginning of Triassic, through the Jurassic, and to the end of the Cretaceous, documenting the entire Mesozoic era with well-preserved fossils. Throughout Dorset there are a number of limestone ridges. The largest and most notable is the band of Cretaceous chalk that runs from the south-west to the north-east of the county and forms part of the Chalk Group that underlies much of the south of England, including Salisbury Plain, the Isle of Wight, and the South Downs. Between the bands of limestone and chalk are wide clay vales with flood plains.

South-east Dorset, around Poole, Bournemouth, and the New Forest, lies on younger and less resistant beds: Eocene clays (mainly London Clay), sands, and gravels. These rocks produce thin soils that historically have supported a heathland habitat. The chalk and limestone hills of Purbeck lie atop Britain&#x27;s largest onshore oil field. The field, operated from Wytch Farm, produces a high-quality oil. Nearby is the world&#x27;s oldest continuously pumping well at Kimmeridge, which has been in use since the early 1960s. The source of this oil is the organic-rich shales found in the lower Lias. Landslides along the coast have been known to ignite these shales, causing cliff fires, the most recent of which occurred in 2000.

==Devonian to Carboniferous==

About 380 Mya, the landmass that was later to form Southern Britain was some 19° south of the equator and lay on the northern shore of an ocean basin that separated the continents of Laurasia and Gondwanaland. When these continents collided to form the single supercontinent of Pangaea, the sediments on the ocean floor were pushed up and over, while the molten rock below the surface was forced out. Today, these igneous intrusions and the red sandstones, visible in the neighbouring county of Devon, slope away from west to east, and are deeply buried beneath younger deposits in Dorset.

==Triassic==

Through most of this period, southern Britain experienced continental conditions, initially with deposition by large river systems forming the Sherwood Sandstone Group. This was succeeded by mudstones with evaporites (including locally thick deposits of halite) deposited in a desert environment, forming the Mercia Mudstone Group. A major change to marine conditions is shown by the mudstones with limestones and sandstones of the overlying Rhaetian age Penarth Group. No rocks from this period crop out in Dorset, but they are known to be present in the subsurface from hydrocarbon exploration drilling.

==Latest Triassic to Jurassic==

Around 204 Mya, Dorset, now 30°N, was under water, and the first ammonites (&quot;Psiloceras planorbis&quot;) appear among the shales and limestones that make up the lower Lias.

===Lower Lias===
Formed during the Late Rhaetian to Pliensbachian, in what was then a shallow marine environment, the lower Lias is composed of Blue Lias, Black Ven Marls, and Green Ammonite Beds (Charmouth Mudstone Formation). Mostly covered by lush vegetation, it forms the floor of Marshwood Vale in the west of Dorset and can be seen in stream beds, where the land has been excavated, and along the coast to the west of Seatown. The sides of the vale are mainly made from the clays and sands of the upper and lower Lias, while younger strata from the Cretaceous Period (145–66 Mya), crown the higher points. The Blue Lias is the lowest of the Liassic strata and where it is visible on the coast near Lyme Regis is layered with hard limestone and oil-rich shale. The iron pyrites in the clay can heat up when exposed to the air and occasionally ignite the shales.

Around Lyme Regis, during the 18th and 19th centuries, the collection and sale of fossils became a popular occupation. Landslides and the excavation of the clays, used in cement production, exposed not only an abundance of ammonites of varying size, but also much larger specimens such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Although these rocks were formed under water, the discovery of fossil wood, land-dwelling animals, and a pterosaur suggest that dry land was close by.

===Middle Lias===
Laid down during the Pliensbachian to Early Toarcian in a shallower marine environment that was subjected to much more turbulent weather conditions, the sediments of the middle Lias are not as muddy as those in the lower Lias, and are much nearer to silt and sand. These sands are thought to have come from the islands that now form part of Cornwall and South Wales. Again, inland exposure is poor, although the middle Lias is visible along the spring line of the hills that surround the Marshwood Vale. The cliffs either side of Eype and the coastal stretch between Thorncombe and Watton Cliff provide the best view. The base of the middle Lias is composed of three thick layers of calcareous sandstone beds separated by marls. These resistant bands form massive buttresses along the sea cliffs, and where eroded, boulder aprons on the foreshore.

Above these three layers is the Eype clay, which was probably deposited in deeper, calmer waters. Ammonites found in this layer had apparently been attacked by larger crustaceans. The fossilised remains of large numbers of brittle stars, found towards the end of this deposition, indicate that they were rapidly covered. Theories put forward suggest a great storm or tidal wave was the cause, and indeed many of the remains appear to have been swept along the sediment, some losing limbs on the way. This particular section of the lias is appropriately known as the &quot;starfish bed&quot;. The succeeding layers of Downcliffe and Thorncombe sands also appear to have been deposited in a periodically stormy environment where silts and sands dominate. Pebbles and cobbles are found here, encrusted with fossilised animals, which suggest that some of the sediments were already lithified; also, some evidence exists of localised fault activity. The last layer in the middle Lias is the Marlstone Rock bed.

===Upper Lias===
The lowest part of the upper Lias, the Beacon Limestone Formation, formed during the Pliensbachian to Toarcian, around 182 Mya. It is known as the junction bed and despite representing 3 million years of deposition, is only 0.6 to 1.5 m thick, where it can be seen at Eype Mouth. In Yorkshire, the equivalent stratum is around 100 m thick, suggesting that Dorset remained under water much longer and was robbed of supplies of sand and clay. This bed is composed of fine-grained limestones from white to pale pink in colour. The clearest evidence of fault activity exists in a section of cliff between West Bay and Eype Mouth, where the junction bed thickens in a section of steps, and fractures in the rock contain sediment from the ocean bed, which most likely was sucked in as the cracks opened.

The remaining part of the upper Lias is the bright yellow Bridport sandstone of Toarcian age, which gives the cliffs between West Bay and Burton Bradstock their distinctive colour. The sands form a band that runs inland to Yeovil. In the east of the county, these sands are some 900 m below the surface and form the Wytch Farm oilfield&#x27;s middle reservoir.

===Inferior Oolite===
The succeeding Inferior Oolite was deposited in a shallow, tropical marine environment, 35° north of the equator, during the Aalenian to early Bathonian. It is only 2 m thick in the south, but increases to 20 m in the north, near Sherborne. It contains many fossils, including bryozoans, brachiopods, ammonites, belemnites, gastropods, bivalves, and echinoids, and like the previous middle and upper Lias, shows signs of fault-controlled deposition. In some places, the sea floor appears to have been breached, and sediments and fossils were trapped like those in the junction bed between West Bay and Eype. Most of Dorset was starved of sediment, and condensed limestones collected. These limestone beds are often iron rich, lending them a rusty colour. One particular bed, exposed at Burton Cliff, contains large numbers of orange, discus-shaped concretions, which on closer inspection reveal themselves to be pieces of shell from a species of mussel, coated with a thin layer of iron-rich sediment.

In the upper section of the Inferior Oolite, two beds are packed with numerous types of sponges, which can be seen around Shipton Gorge and Burton Bradstock. Despite being formed in a marine environment, the oolite, like the lower Lias, contains some fossilised remains of land-dwelling creatures, including two species of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; that were found near Sherborne.

===Great Oolite===
Fuller&#x27;s Earth Formation clays were deposited across much of southern Dorset when the continental shelf subsided, forcing the region deeper underwater during the early Bathonian. The lower clays are visible at Burton Bradstock and contain large numbers of &quot;Bositra buchi&quot;. These bivalves may have been able to swim freely, thus able to avoid the soupy mud on the sea floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;E35/36&quot;&gt;Ensom (pp.35–36)&lt;/ref&gt; A limestone known as Fuller&#x27;s Earth rock is found in the north-west of the county, between the clays south and east of Sherborne. It is rich in ammonites and bivalves. Previously referred to as the Upper Fuller&#x27;s Earth Clay, the succeeding Frome Clay can be seen to the west of West Bay, where it forms the major part of the West Cliff. It contains many brachiopods, particularly in the Weymouth Anticline where the oyster beds are 5 m thick. At the junction between the Frome Clay and the overlying Forest Marble is the Boueti Bed, so called because of the large numbers of the brachiopod &quot;Goniorhynchia boueti&quot; found there. It is best viewed on the Herbury peninsula south of Langton Herring. The limestone known as Forest Marble is not a true metamorphic marble but it takes a high polish, and has been used as a building material and marble substitute for many years. Outcrops of Forest Marble are concentrated around the Weymouth Anticline, the coastal escarpment between Burton Bradstock and Abbotsbury, and inland as far as Bothenhampton, where they disappear below younger Cretaceous deposits. Surfacing once more at Rampisham, they turn east and then north into Somerset. The limestone does not form one continuous bed as previously thought, but rather forms pockets in a formation that is predominately clay. Severe tropical storms likely swept up large quantities of shells and other invertebrates and deposited them in this way. The formation of the Forest Marble suggests a shallowing of the sea and the remains of pieces of tree, and bits of land-dwelling animals, are found among the turtles, frogs, and salamanders within.

Above the Forest Marble lies the Cornbrash sequence of early Callovian age, which is dominated by rubbly limestone. Unsuitable for building stone, these limestones have been used for lime production and road construction. In the north of the county, an already lithified Cornbrash floor was being eroded, and the resulting pebbles gathered serpulid worms, bryozoans, and bivalves as they rolled around beneath the shallow sea.

===Ancholme Group===
From the early Callovian to the early Kimmeridgian, the future Dorset, at 36°N, still had a tropical climate and the limestones, clays, silts, and sands from this period were laid down in a marine environment that ranged from deep water to tidal shallows. The shallow water in which the Cornbrash limestones were deposited was followed by marginally deeper water in which the Kellaway Beds were laid down. The Kellaway Beds are only visible in the banks of streams and rivers, and the brick pits at Chickerell and Rampisham, where the succeeding Oxford Clays were quarried. The Oxford Clays were deposited in much deeper water and cover the valley floors between Weymouth and the Blackmore Vale. They can also be seen in the cliffs at Tidmoor Point, Jordan Hill, and the previously mentioned brick pits at Chickerell. Poor exposure, coupled with a decline in the brick industry, has made detailed mapping of the clays difficult, and now relies heavily on trenches dug for services. These excavations have unearthed some impressive examples of Septarian nodules.

The exposure of Nothe Grit, to the south of Weymouth, suggests a return to shallower water conditions and a more turbulent environment. In the following 4.5 million years, a cycle of lagoonal, tidal, and deep-water environments caused by a world-wide fluctuations in sea levels, deposited beds of sand, clay, and limestone across the entire county. The Corallian strata can be seen on the Weymouth anticline, between Abbotsbury and Osmington. It then disappears to emerge as a low escarpment between Mappowder and Cucklington on the Somerset border. Near the top of this formation is the Ringstead Waxy Clay, in which large delta-shaped oysters are found and at the top of the Corallian is the Ringstead Coral Bed.

Benecliff grit, a soft sandstone containing large doggers, is well exposed at the headland, Bran Point. Once a reservoir, oil sometimes seeps from the cliff here, and an oily residue is present in the sands nearby.

===Kimmeridge Clay===

The varied rock types of the Corallian are superseded by the Kimmeridge clay, a bed of dark clays and shales up to 500 m thick. These deposits occurred in a deep marine environment, 38° north. Deposited in an oxygen-deficient environment, the Kimmeridge beds make up the major part of the Purbeck Monocline and the periphery of the Weymouth Anticline. They form a low-lying band running north to south through the Blackmore Vale, and underpin the strip of land between the isle of Portland and the mainland. The unusual iron-rich sediment near Abbotsbury was, in a departure from the norm, deposited in shallow iron-rich water and the pale bands throughout the formation were caused by coccoliths following periodic blooms of algae.

Many of the fossilised remains are squashed flat, indicating that the Kimmeridge beds were heavily compacted, perhaps to an eighth of their original thickness. This was not sufficient to produce oil reservoirs like those beneath the North Sea, yet the oil-rich shales have, in the past, been economically important as a local fuel.

===Portland Group===

Whether the formations created between the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous were deposited across the whole of Dorset like the preceding beds, and subsequently eroded, or only formed in the areas in which they are now found is unclear.

The Portland sands were created in a deep marine environment, whereas the Portland stone was a near-shore deposit. The lower Portland ,and formation, usually greyish-blue in colour, consists of dolomite beds best viewed on the West Weares, Gad Cliff, and Hounstout. The overlying Portland stone is a distinctive white oolite containing thick-shelled fossils and marine algae. The marine algae, which formed large reefs, are responsible for the occasional stacked and arched bands in the formation and are best viewed in the Roach, an extremely fossiliferous limestone confined to the north of Isle of Portland.

To the north of the oolite is a fine-grained limestone, which was deposited in calm, shallow water. It contains flint-like rocks known as chert, were it not for the presence of very large ammonites, might be mistaken for an early chalk. Previously thought to be around the middle of the Purbeck Strata, modern research suggests that the boundary between the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods lies within the basal few metres of the overlying Lower Purbeck.

==Latest Jurassic to Cretaceous==

===Purbeck Group===

The Purbeck Limestone Group is a succession of limestones, shales, and clays named after the Isle of Purbeck, laid down in the latest Tithonian to late Berriasian mainly in very shallow lagoons and freshwater lakes, with only occasional marine influence at the lower levels where halite, gypsum, and other evaporites are found. The muddled sediments around Lulworth are thought to be caused by a thick layer of these evaporites dissolving. Evidence also exists of uplift and erosion of earlier formations. The climate around this time had changed from a tropical to a subtropical one, with pronounced wet and dry seasons as indicated by the growth rings in the fossilised trees also found in the lower levels of the Purbeck strata. These trees grew around the low coastal areas and were, from time to time, subjected to drowning from the sea. The fallen trees and their stumps became covered by stromatolites which trapped sediments. The limestones at this level, which vary greatly in colour, are composed of densely packed shells of the freshwater snail &quot;Viviparus&quot;. Their ability to take a very high polish has led them to become known as Purbeck Marble. Like the older Forest Marble, it is a sedimentary marble rather than a true metamorphic one.

The Purbeck Limestone Group has yielded a diverse selection of fossilised remains, including rare reptiles, amphibians, and mammals, for which the formation has become internationally important.

===Wealden Group===
The Wealden Beds are confined to the south and increase in thickness from 107 to 716 m, between Upwey and Swanage. By the latest part of the Berriasian, the waters covering Dorset&#x27;s landmass had subsided, leaving the area almost completely terrestrial save for the large rivers that dominated it. These rivers drained the upland areas to the north and west, and were responsible for depositing much of the succeeding sediment across southern Dorset. Comprising clays, silts, sands, and grits, they cover the floors of the valleys between Lulworth and Swanage. The sands and grits are also exposed in the cliffs there, and form ridges along the valleys. Traces of granite from Cornubia, the landmass that later became Cornwall, were also washed down. The Wealden Beds contain a great deal of plant matter and charcoal, indicating periodic fires in the region. At Mupe Bay, some of the sands have been bound together by oil and formed into sandstone boulders, suggesting that oil generation had already begun when these sands were deposited.

===Lower Greensand and Selborne groups===
The marginal marine incursions that occurred in the previous period increased in severity until Dorset was completely under water by the Aptian. The geology from this period indicates a gradual flooding of the county from the south-east to the north-west. The earliest deposit, the Lower Greensand, covers the preceding Wealden Beds in the south, and the Oxford and Kimmeridge clays in the north. It is so called because of its green colour, which is caused by the presence of the mineral glauconite.

In the west, overlying the eroded Lias, is a thin layer of Gault Clay of Albian age, which decreases in thickness from 27 to 7 m the further west it stretches, and can be located by the spring lines around the chalk ridges and escarpments. The water that sits between these two beds is responsible for the many landslips that have occurred throughout the county&#x27;s history. Around Compton Valence, it lies on the Fuller&#x27;s earth, whereas between Ringstead and White Nothe, it covers the Kimmeridge Clay and the Portland and Purbeck strata. Because geologists are certain all the formations from the Lias to the Kimmeridge Clay were deposited over the whole of the county, the Gault clay reveals the scale of uplift and erosion that must have taken place before Dorset was flooded. The overlying Gault is revealed in the spring lines around the chalk ridges and escarpments. This water is also responsible for the many landslips throughout Dorset&#x27;s history from the prehistoric to modern times.

Above the Gault is the Upper Greensand, which varies from the golden sands that crown the West Dorset heights, such as Pilsdon Pen and Golden Cap, to the rubbly sandstones found in the centre of the county. The fossiliferous, green sandstone found around Shaftesbury contains many ammonites, which when compared to other deposits, indicates condensed deposition during different periods at different locations, and detailed analysis reveals that basement structures were still active at this time.

===Chalk Group===
The sea levels remained more or less unchanged until the end of the Cretaceous period, and despite Dorset having moved even further north to 40°, the climate had reverted to a tropical one. During the Late Cretaceous epoch, the sea deposited an enormous amount of chalk across the county, perhaps as much as 300 m more than currently remaining. The first chalk deposits contained sands and grits thought to have originated in Cornubia. This gritty chalk was deposited across central Dorset, and can clearly be seen in the sides of Eggardon Hill. As the water deepened, plankton, coccoliths, and foraminifera became the main source for the calcareous soup, which would later form the Dorset chalk. The chalk forms a narrow strip inland between Studland and Worbarrow Bay, when it reaches the coast once more. A much wider strip continues westward along the coast until it meets the wide swathe of chalk that cuts north-west across the county and forms the south-east point of the Hampshire Basin. Generally, the Dorset chalk is too soft to be used as a building stone except along the Ridgeway, where faulting and folding produced a particularly hard variety popularly used by the Romans in their mosaics. The chalk often contains larger fossils, including ammonites, belemnites, and brachiopods. Flint occurs throughout in both nodule and tabular layers.

The iridium-rich layer of sediment, found around the world at the K-Pg boundary, is missing in Dorset. This may be due to the uplift and erosion that removed the upper layers of the chalk. The sediments resting on the Dorset chalk are, for the same reason, distinctly different from those in other parts of the world, and the remains of the plants and animals within are much more recent.

==Early Paleogene==
The expansion of the North Atlantic, which first occurred during the Triassic period, now reached a point where it was affecting the Dorset landscape. Areas that were previously under water were exposed to erosion as the chalk was folded and forced upwards. The early deposits from this period, found across South-East England, do not occur in Dorset. The small amounts found in Devon, however, coupled with the many solution holes found across the Dorset chalk, suggest that erosion may have removed them. Some of the larger solution holes, known as dolines, are found on the heaths between Dorchester and Bere Regis. Near Briantspuddle is Culpepper&#x27;s Dish, 86 m wide and over 21 m deep.

The first deposits found from this period in Dorset are the Reading Formation clays. A subdivision of the Lambeth Group, they are visible above the chalk at Studland. Mottled, brightly coloured, and generally lacking fossils, the clays are thought to be deposited beneath lagoons. In the east of the county, however, fossilised remains of gastropods and sharks&#x27; teeth have been found alongside flint pebbles, clearly identifying these clays as marine deposits.

The Bracklesham Group, found across much of the Dorset portion of the Hampshire Basin, were mainly deposited by rivers, and form the foundations of the Dorset heathland. The frequent and heavy rains that occurred during this period transported large amounts of material from northern uplands across the Purbeck and Weymouth areas. A thick layer of chert gravel from the Purbeck strata can be found on Blackdown Hill near Portesham, but whether it was carried there or is the remains of an earlier deposit is unknown. Blocks of quartzite can be found across the downlands of southern Dorset, and these sarsens have been used in some of the local prehistoric monuments.

To the north and east of the county, much finer sands and gravels are found, including ball clay, which was widely mined on the heaths around Wareham. The fine particles that make up the clay are believed to have originated in the west, where rocks were being broken down by the alternating dry, humid conditions and torrential rain, which in turn formed rivers and carried the material to its current position. Overlying the clay is the Agglestone grit, an iron-cemented sandstone, which forms the Agglestone near Studland, and has been used in the buildings in and around the heathland where it is found.
Fossilised palms taken from the cliffs at Bournemouth confirm that Dorset had a tropical climate at the time. Creech Barrow Hill is crowned with a unique early Eocene limestone that has yielded some important fossils. Outcrops of rock from the Barton Group occur along the coast between Bournemouth and Hengistbury Head.

==Late Paleogene to Neogene==
During this period, Dorset drifted a further 9° north, the climate cooled rapidly, and by the late Eocene was temperate. Mainly terrestrial with fresh and brackish water environments, the county, despite its low-lying nature, remained largely without marine influences except for some minor incursions at the end of the ice ages. The late Palaeogene deposits that filled the Hampshire Basin as the sea levels fell are not found in Dorset, nor are the Neogene, which are absent from virtually all of the British Isles.

The collision of the African Plate and Eurasian Plate that occurred around this time caused a violent uplift in the south of the county, the results of which can be seen clearly at Stair Hole, where the strata run almost vertically. Further, but less dramatic folding and uplift, along the county&#x27;s subsurface faults, coupled with continuing erosion of Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments, created Dorset&#x27;s modern landscape and drainage patterns.

==Quaternary==
During the last 2,600,000 years, Britain was subjected to a number of extreme fluctuations in temperature, which included three ice ages. Dorset was not affected by glaciation, but did experience very low temperatures with permafrost on the high ground. Sudden changes in sea level, and successive warming and cooling, significantly modified the landscape. The two raised beaches at Portland created 210,000 and 125,000 years ago are a dramatic testament to the fluctuations in sea levels. The causes of these two fluctuations were twofold - the growth of the ice-sheets, which locked away large quantities of water, and the weight of the ice in the north that caused the landmass to tilt.

During the summers, partial melting of the ice created large rivers that washed enormous amounts of sand and gravel across the county, forming huge terraces in both the upland areas and valleys. These rivers cut down into the landscape as they made their way to the lower sea levels. This action caused many large-scale landslips, most notably around Shaftesbury and Abbotsbury.

Landslips caused by marine erosion still occur today, with some of the largest taking place along the West Dorset Coast. Fossilised remains, including the teeth and tusks of elephants and mammoths dating back 500,000 years, are often exposed. Flint and chert tools from early human visitors have been retrieved from the river terraces around the Dorset and Devon border, although these may have been transported here with the other river deposits. Chesil Bank, a long barrier beach stretching from West Bay to Portland, was created 10,000 years ago, when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age.

==Structure==
===Structural development===
The Variscan orogeny is the oldest event for which evidence is found in Dorset, forming a major series of thrust faults in Carboniferous and older rocks. These thrusts trend west–east, dip moderately towards the south, and have controlled later basin development and subsequent phases of inversion. During the Permo-Triassic, the area was affected by a phase of rifting that reactivated the older thrusts in extension. These extensional faults were themselves reactivated during further rifting in Jurassic to early Cretaceous times. The area experienced the effects of the early stages of Alpine collision during the Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene, with reverse reactivation of many of the extensional faults, creating the most visible of the structures in the Dorset area, such as the Purbeck Monocline.

===Litton Cheney Fault===
The Litton Cheney Fault is a west–to-east-trending, south-dipping normal fault. The fault was active during deposition of the Lias Group and again during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous. Some evidence exists of minor reversal on the fault during the late Cretaceous to Palaeogene inversion.

===Abbotsbury–Ridgeway Fault===
This major west–to-east-trending, south-dipping normal fault was mainly active during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous, as shown by the local preservation of the Wealden in its hanging wall. It was reactivated as a reverse fault during the late Cretaceous to Palaeogene, and now juxtaposes Portland and Purbeck beds in the hanging wall against chalk in the footwall. The fault is not directly linked to faults beneath the Triassic salt layer.
===Weymouth Anticline===
The Weymouth Anticline has a west–to-east-trending axis and plunges to the east. Strata beneath the Upper Triassic halite are unfolded, indicating that the salt is acting as a decollement. The anticline is a result of inversion along the Abbotsbury–Ridgeway Fault, although it may have developed by the tightening of an earlier rollover anticline, formed during an earlier extensional phase, due to the soft-linked nature of the faulting.

===Purbeck Monocline===

This monoclinal structure forms part of a semicontinuous structure extending eastwards through the Isle of Wight as the Portland-Wight Monocline (or Disturbance). This was formed by reverse reactivation of the Purbeck–Isle of Wight fault zone.

<text>John William Leckie (born 23 October 1949) is an English record producer and recording engineer. His production credits include Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Real Life&quot; (1978); XTC&#x27;s &quot;White Music&quot; (1978); Dukes of Stratosphear&#x27;s &quot;25 O&#x27;Clock&quot; and the Fall&#x27;s &quot;This Nation&#x27;s Saving Grace&quot; (both 1985); the Stone Roses&#x27; &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; (1989); the Verve&#x27;s &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; (1993); Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995); Cast&#x27;s &quot;All Change&quot; (1995); Muse&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001); and the Levellers&#x27; &quot;We the Collective&quot; (2018).

==Early life==
Born in Paddington, London, Leckie was educated at the Quintin School, a grammar school in North West London, then Ravensbourne college of Art and Design in Bromley. After leaving school, he worked for United Motion Pictures as an audio assistant.

==Career==
Leckie began work at Abbey Road Studios on 15 February 1970 as a tape operator, later graduating to balance engineer and record producer. During his early career he worked as a tape operator with artists such as George Harrison (&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;), John Lennon (&quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;) and Syd Barrett (&quot;Barrett&quot;). He moved up to the desk to be balance engineer for Pink Floyd (&quot;Meddle&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;), for Mott the Hoople&#x27;s album &quot;Mott&quot; and Paul McCartney and Wings&#x27; &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; and the single &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot;. Other engineering sessions at Abbey Road at this time were with Roy Harper, Soft Machine, Sammy Hagar, Jack Rieley&#x27;s &quot;Western Justice&quot; album and the last recordings with Syd Barrett.

His first jobs as producer, in 1976, were Be-Bop Deluxe&#x27;s third album, &quot;Sunburst Finish&quot;, and Doctors of Madness&#x27; Figments of Emancipation. His collaboration with Be-Bop Deluxe continued with &quot;Modern Music&quot;, &quot;Live! In the Air Age&quot; and &quot;Drastic Plastic&quot;. In 1977 Leckie produced the Adverts&#x27; &quot;Crossing the Red Sea with the Adverts&quot;, Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Real Life&quot;.

Leckie left Abbey Road in 1978 and produced albums for Simple Minds (&quot;Life in a Day&quot;, &quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot; and &quot;Empires and Dance&quot;). For Be-Bop Deluxe founder Bill Nelson, he produced the Red Noise album &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; and Nelson&#x27;s subsequent solo album &quot;Quit Dreaming And Get On The Beam&quot; (the latter unreleased until 1981). Leckie recorded the début single, &quot;Public Image&quot;, for Public Image Ltd and produced the Human League&#x27;s &quot;Holiday 80&quot; EP. Leckie&#x27;s work with XTC included producing their debut &quot;3D&quot; single and EP, and first two studio albums, &quot;White Music&quot; and &quot;Go 2&quot;. In 1981 he worked with the legendary Irish band the Atrix on their single &quot;Procession&quot;. Later he went on to produce 25 O&#x27;Clock and Psonic Psunspot, which XTC issued under the pseudonym the Dukes of Stratosphear in the mid-1980s.

In 1989 Leckie produced the Stone Roses&#x27; debut album, &quot;The Stone Roses&quot;. The album was voted the best record of all time on a music poll taken by BBC Radio 6 Music and features as Number 1 on &quot;Observer&#x27;s&quot; June 2004 &quot;100 Greatest British Albums&quot;. Some months later he produced and mixed their single &quot;Fools Gold&quot;, which charted at No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart, and in early 1990 he produced and mixed the single &quot;One Love&quot; which also charted at no. 4 in UK. Leckie also worked on much of the recording the Stone Roses&#x27; album &quot;Second Coming.&quot; In 1995, Leckie produced &quot;All Change&quot; by the Liverpool band Cast, which became Polydor Records&#x27; highest-selling debut album.

Leckie produced and engineered Radiohead&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995), which drew significant critical attention. Radiohead praised Leckie for demystifying the studio environment. The guitarist Jonny Greenwood said: &quot;He didn&#x27;t treat us like he had some kind of witchcraft that only he understands. There&#x27;s no mystery to it, which is so refreshing.&quot; Radiohead&#x27;s future producer, Nigel Godrich, worked on &quot;The Bends&quot; as an engineer&quot;.&quot; He named Leckie as one of the producers who had taught him his craft, whom he had &quot;watched directly and emulated&quot;.

Leckie&#x27;s next projects were the first two albums by Muse, &quot;Showbiz&quot; (1999) and &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001). The albums drew comparisons to Radiohead, which Leckie dismissed, saying: &quot;In the late 90s, any British band that sang passionately and played guitar was going to get compared to Radiohead.&quot; He said he had been invited to produce several &quot;Radiohead copycats&quot; after &quot;The Bends&quot;, and chose to produce Muse because he had &quot;intentionally looked for something different&quot;. When Muse won UK Single of the Year at the 2010 Music Producers Guild Awards, the songwriter, Matt Bellamy, thanked Leckie for &quot;teaching us how to produce&quot;.

<text>Ronnie O&#x27;Brien (born 5 January 1979) is an Irish retired footballer.

Although released early in his career by his first club Middlesbrough, he was subsequently signed by Juventus in 1999. During three years with the Italian club, he played only occasionally for the first team and was loaned out to Lugano in Switzerland, lower division Italian clubs Crotone and Lecco, and Dundee United in Scotland. After leaving Juventus in 2002, O&#x27;Brien spent the rest of his career playing in Major League Soccer (MLS) for FC Dallas, Toronto FC and San Jose Earthquakes before retiring in 2008. He was named in the MLS Best XI in both 2004 and 2005, and was selected for the MLS All-Star Game for four years running.

O&#x27;Brien also represented the Republic of Ireland under-16 team and was part of the squad that won the 1998 Under-16 European Championship.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s footballing career began very promisingly, when at the age of 18 he signed a contract with Middlesbrough of the FA Premier League. After two years and little playing time with Middlesbrough, O&#x27;Brien was released on a free transfer.

Italian giants Juventus offered the 20-year-old O&#x27;Brien a five-year contract; however, he had trouble getting playing time on such a talented side and was loaned out to Lugano of Switzerland, Dundee United of Scotland, and lower league Italian side Lecco. After several years of disappointment and one Intertoto Cup appearance, O&#x27;Brien was released from his contract with Juventus in 2002.

His solitary competitive appearance for Juventus was an Intertoto Cup match against Rostov on 4 August 1999 when he entered the match as a substitute for Zoran Mirković in the 77th minute.

====MLS====
In search of consistent playing time, O&#x27;Brien, made the unconventional decision to move to America to join the Dallas Burn. O&#x27;Brien made an immediate impact, scoring on his debut for the club in a US Open Cup match. He finished the 2002 season with two goals and two assists in 11 games but had proven himself one of the more dynamic players on the team. O&#x27;Brien entered the 2003 season with great expectations, but these were cut short early in the season. In the Burn&#x27;s third game of the season, a tackle from D.C. United&#x27;s Dema Kovalenko broke O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s tibia, effectively ending his season. O&#x27;Brien returned to the team in 2004 and was one of the team&#x27;s offensive leaders – he started 29 games, registering two goals and 10 assists, was named to the MLS Best XI, and helped revitalise a Burn team that had recorded one of the league&#x27;s worst records ever in the previous season.

In 2005, O&#x27;Brien repeated his Best XI form, finishing the year with six goals and 12 assists. During the 2006 season, O&#x27;Brien clashed with FC Dallas&#x27; head coach Colin Clarke all season. His form was poor and he finished with only one goal in 27 games. At the conclusion of the season, O&#x27;Brien was traded to the expansion club Toronto FC with a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that Toronto FC would not draft any other FC Dallas players.

Due to a knee injury during a training session, which was later aggravated during a friendly match, O&#x27;Brien was limited to 13 games in the 2007 season.

In 2008, O&#x27;Brien was traded to the San Jose Earthquakes. In return, Toronto FC received San Jose&#x27;s first round pick in the 2009 draft plus an undisclosed amount of money. He made 28 appearances, scoring four goals (his 16th in the MLS). His six assists brought his MLS career assist total to 45 (from 142 total appearances).

Following O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s strong performance and evident leadership in 2008, the San Jose Earthquakes stunned their fans by failing to pick up his contract option for the 2009 season. Instead, Earthquakes&#x27; GM John Doyle was hoping that he would accept a substantial pay cut. In January 2009, O&#x27;Brien made it known that he would not be returning to the San Jose Earthquakes. Without O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s leadership and strong play, the Earthquakes struggled early in 2009. Despite a favourable schedule in which San Jose played five of their seven games at home, the Quakes managed just one win, leading many San Jose fans to call for O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s return.

===International career===
O&#x27;Brien achieved success with the Republic of Ireland national youth sides, including winning the 1998 Under-16 European Championship alongside John O&#x27;Shea.

Despite having played multiple times for the Irish underage sides, O&#x27;Brien only received one call-up to the senior side. Steve Staunton contacted Toronto FC about his availability for a short tour of the US in June 2007. However, O&#x27;Brien turned down the chance to play for his country again, as he had just returned from injury, while adding he was happy playing club football.

==Coaching career==
He is now a coach of FC Dallas&#x27; youth teams.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Brien keeps an off-season residence in Dallas and is an avid Dallas Mavericks fan.

===&quot;Time&quot; magazine stunt===
In August 1999, e-mails circulated urging Irish people to vote for Ronnie O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s Person of the Century Internet poll, causing O&#x27;Brien to lead the poll, above those such as Albert Einstein and Martin Luther King Jr. After the poll crashed due to attracting too much traffic, &quot;Time&quot; removed O&#x27;Brien from the running, restating the rule that &quot;whimsical candidates will not be counted.&quot;

<doc id="1121673" wikidata="Q5439999" url="?curid=1121673" title="Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation">
<text>The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, also known as Farmer Mac, is a stockholder-owned, publicly traded company that was chartered by the United States federal government in 1988 to serve as a secondary market in agricultural loans such as mortgages for agricultural real estate and rural housing. The company purchases loans from agricultural lenders, and sells instruments backed by those loans. The company also works with the United States Department of Agriculture. It is based in Washington, D.C.

==History==
It was created by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 () as a federally chartered, private corporation responsible for guaranteeing the timely repayment of principal and interest to investors in a new agricultural secondary market. The secondary market allows a lending institution to sell a qualified farm real estate loan to an agricultural mortgage marketing facility, or pooler, which packages these loans, and sells to investors securities that are backed by, or represent interests in, the pooled loans. Farmer Mac guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest on these securities and, under authorities granted in 1995, can also serve as a loan pooler.

The company was founded in the midst of a $4 billion bailout of the Farm Credit System, hoping to provide an alternative source of credit to farmers following the models of Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae.

===Financial crisis of 2008===
In June 2008, Farmer Mac had $47.2 million invested in Fannie Mae shares. Over the next few months, in the wake of the Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, these investments lost about $44 million in value. The company also had significant investments in the newly-bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings. In response, the Farm Credit System bailed the company out by purchasing $60 million in Farmer Mac stock, and Zions Bancorporation of Salt Lake City purchased another $5 million in stock.

The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 24 January 1972 and her keel was laid down on 8 May 1976. She was launched on 22 July 1978 sponsored by Mrs. Helen Jackson (née Hardin), wife of Henry M. Jackson, and commissioned on 28 March 1981.

==Ship history==

On 11 March 1999, &quot;Bremerton&quot; used one torpedo to sink the derelict forebody of the merchant ship &quot;New Carissa&quot; off the Oregon coast. assisted in sinking the ship.
After a successful Western Pacific deployment, in September 2003 &quot;Bremerton&quot; changed its homeport to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. &quot;Bremerton&quot; spent two months in drydock at Pearl Harbor ending 21 January 2010.

When was decommissioned on 23 January 2010, &quot;Bremerton&quot; became the oldest commissioned submarine in the US fleet. On that day, Richard O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s cribbage board was transferred from &quot;Los Angeles&quot; to &quot;Bremerton&quot;, a tradition that dates back to World War II. When &quot;Bremerton&quot; was inactivated in 2018, the cribbage board was transferred from &quot;Bremerton&quot; to USS &quot;Olympia&quot; (SSN-717).

In January 2011, &quot;Bremerton&quot; was adopted by its namesake city, along with a partnership of community members and organizations led by the Bremerton-Olympic Peninsula Council of the US Navy League. In February 2015, &quot;Bremerton&quot; visited the City of Bremerton.

On 15 June 2016, the 35-year-old submarine completed her 15th deployment. Although originally scheduled for decommissioning in 2017, USS &quot;Bremerton&quot;&#x27;s life was extended for an unspecified period. On 20 July 17, 2017, she became the longest-commissioned U.S. Navy submarine, surpassing at the time. On 6 April 2018, she returned to Pearl Harbor from her final deployment, soon to be decommissioned.

On 20 April 2018, USS Bremerton left Pearl Harbor for the last time en route to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, to enter the submarine recycling program.

===Decommissioning===

&quot;Bremerton&quot; had her decommissioning ceremony 18 May 2021, at the U.S. Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, Washington, though the actual decommissioning did not occur until later that year. Due to COVID restrictions, crewmembers were not allowed to attend the event in person, but SUBGRU 9 streamed the event live globally via Facebook Live and YouTube. &quot;Bremerton&quot; was officially decommissioned 21 May 2021.

She was launched on 18 November 1978 using the pontoon system designed for the launching of the Trident submarines. &quot;Jacksonville&quot; was sponsored by Mrs. Dorothy Jean Bennett, wife of Congressman Charles E. Bennett, and commissioned on 16 May 1981.

&quot;Jacksonville&quot;″s operations have included a variety of fleet exercises and deployments including two around-the-world cruises in 1982 and 1985, deployments to the western Atlantic Ocean in 1983, 1986, 1993 and 1994, and deployments to the Mediterranean Sea in 1987 and 1993. In 1988, &quot;Jacksonville&quot; participated in a shock trials test program for &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines, which was followed by a three-year major modernization overhaul in Norfolk Naval Shipyard.

&quot;Jacksonville&quot; has been involved in four collisions with other vessels during her over 30 years of operation:

*While outbound with the inbound Turkish merchant vessel &quot;General Z. Dogan&quot; in the vicinity of Norfolk, Virginia on 22 March 1982.
*With a barge positioned across Chesapeake Bay&#x27;s Thimble Shoal Channel, requiring the replacement of the submarine&#x27;s sonar dome, on 21 September 1984.
*With the container ship &quot;Saudi Makkah&quot; near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, requiring repairs to the submarine&#x27;s fairwater planes and rudder, on 17 May 1996.
*With an unnamed fishing vessel while on regular patrol in the Persian Gulf on 10 January 2013. Her main periscope was sheared off in the collision. The ship&#x27;s commanding and executive officers were relieved for cause following the incident.

In late 2009, &quot;Jacksonville&quot;″s homeport was moved from Norfolk to Pearl Harbor.

On 20 December 2004 a small fire broke out aboard &quot;Jacksonville&quot; while she was undergoing a refueling overhaul at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The fire was immediately extinguished and the reactor was never in danger, though a shipyard firefighter and a sailor were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation.

In August 2017, &quot;Jacksonville&quot; completed her final deployment, ending 36 years of Submarine Service. On 11 December 2017, she arrived in Bremerton, Washington, to commence a months-long preparation for inactivation and decommissioning.

On 26 June 2019, &quot;Jacksonville&quot; held an inactivation ceremony at the U.S. Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, Washington. Former Commanding Officer Michael Brown and former Chief of the Boat (also former Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy) Terry Scott were among the speakers.

On 16 November 2021, &quot;Jacksonville&quot; was decommissioned in a ceremony at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

==Specifications==
&quot;Jacksonville&quot; is long with a beam of and a draft of . The submarine is equipped with an S6G reactor that allows 15 knots surfaced and 32 plus knots submerged. The submarine can operate with an approximate depth range, safe depth, and crush depth.

&quot;Jacksonville&quot; has a crew of 12 officers and 121 enlisted personnel. The armament is four 533mm TT MK 67, located amidship for Tomahawk missiles, MK 48 (and MK 48 ADCAP) torpedoes with 22 reloads plus 2 additional for emergencies. The submarine was decommissioned in 2021.

<text>USS &quot;Norfolk&quot; (SSN-714), a attack submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Norfolk, Virginia.

==History==
The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 20 February 1976 and her keel was laid down on 1 August 1979. She was launched on 31 October 1981 sponsored by Mrs. Caspar Weinberger, and commissioned on 21 May 1983.

&quot;Norfolk&quot; conducted extensive trials of the next-generation torpedo, ADCAP, as well as advanced and secret acoustic experiments. The ship also made an active deployment during one of the final spurts of activity from the declining Soviet navy. On 23 July 1988 &quot;Norfolk&quot; fired the first ADCAP torpedo, sinking the ex-. 

On 17 January 1989, &quot;Norfolk&quot; collided with the combat stores ship in the Thimble Shoals channel as both vessels were headed to sea. &quot;Norfolk&quot; struck her starboard side into the port side of &quot;San Diego&quot;. There were no injuries, but both ships suffered damage. &quot;Norfolk&quot;″s commanding officer was subsequently relieved of command. The sub made a surface transit to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay for drydocking and repairs within a few days, and &quot;San Diego&quot; required dry dock repairs that were completed 10 April 1989. As a result of this collision, COMSUBLANT issued orders limiting submarine speed and passing activities while in the restricted waters of the Hampton Roads channels.

On 25 August 2004, &quot;Norfolk&quot; returned to Naval Station Norfolk after a 22-month Engineering Refueling Overhaul (ERO) at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.

&quot;Norfolk&quot; was decommissioned on 11 December 2014 at her homeport of Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.

<doc id="1121680" wikidata="Q1718601" url="?curid=1121680" title="USS Buffalo (SSN-715)">
<text>USS &quot;Buffalo&quot; (SSN-715) was a , the second vessel that actively served the United States Navy to be named for Buffalo, New York (another USS &quot;Buffalo&quot; was named for the animal). The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 23 February 1976, and her keel was laid down on 25 January 1980. She was launched on 8 May 1982 sponsored by Mrs. Joanne Kemp, wife of former Buffalo Bills quarterback and New York&#x27;s 31st congressional district representative Jack Kemp, who was credited with winning approval to name the ship after the city in his district. &quot;Buffalo&quot; was commissioned on 5 November 1983, with Commander G. Michael Hewitt in command. &quot;Buffalo&quot; was decommissioned on 30 January 2019 after 35 years of service.

==Operational history==

===1980s===

Upon commissioning, &quot;Buffalo&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 8 in Norfolk, Virginia. In 1984, after a five-month post-shakedown maintenance availability, &quot;Buffalo&quot; transited through the Panama Canal during a change of homeport to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1.

&quot;Buffalo&quot; completed her first deployment to the Western Pacific in 1985, where she became the first nuclear-powered submarine to anchor off the coast of Pattaya Beach, Thailand. &quot;Buffalo&quot;&#x27;s second Western Pacific deployment came in 1987, after which she was awarded her first Battle Effectiveness Award, which she proceeded to win for three consecutive years. She conducted another Western Pacific deployment from late 1988 to early 1989.

===1990s===

After conducting Western and Eastern Pacific deployments in 1990, the next year &quot;Buffalo&quot; entered dry-dock in Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and began a yearlong Depot Modernization Period during which she was temporarily assigned to Submarine Squadron 7. In the following years, &quot;Buffalo&quot; conducted numerous deployments to the Eastern and Western Pacific, earning a CNO Letter of Commendation for her 1997 deployment.

&quot;Buffalo&quot; conducted the first-ever dual Selected Restricted Availability, sharing a dry-dock with the USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (SSN-688) in 1998, followed by an Eastern Pacific deployment that included special Joint Operations with the United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard, for which she was awarded the Coast Guard Special Operations Ribbon. In 1999, she conducted another Western Pacific deployment, earning the Battle &quot;E&quot; again, which occurred again in 2001.

===2000s===

In 2002, &quot;Buffalo&quot; entered dry-dock in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and became the first ship to undergo the multi-year nuclear refueling process in Hawaii. In late November 2005, the DDS was used to launch an underwater glider capable of gathering and storing information to be later transmitted using a built-in satellite phone.

====Operations in Guam====

&quot;Buffalo&quot; changed homeport again in 2007 to Naval Base Guam, where she operated out of Apra Harbor assigned to Submarine Squadron 15 as one of the Navy&#x27;s most forward-deployed submarine assets. While stationed in Guam, she conducted 11 missions vital to national security and visited Australia, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Saipan, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand. She won numerous awards including three Battle &quot;E&quot; awards, the prestigious Pacific Fleet Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation.

===2010s===

====Return to Hawaii====

After five and a half years in Guam, &quot;Buffalo&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in early 2013, rejoining Submarine Squadron 1. After completing a 17-month Pre-Inactivation Restricted Availability, on 23 December 2016 &quot;Buffalo&quot; completed her final Western Pacific deployment prior to scheduled decommissioning, for which she earned a Navy Unit Commendation. On 1 May 2017, &quot;Buffalo&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for the final time.

====Inactivation and decommissioning====

Per the Annual Report to Congress on Long-Range Planning for Construction of Naval Vessels for FY2013, &quot;Buffalo&quot; was originally scheduled for decommissioning in 2017. On 26 May 2017, &quot;Buffalo&quot; arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Friday for inactivation and decommissioning. &quot;Buffalo&quot; was officially placed in reserve status, inactivated but in commission on 30 September 2017. On 16 July 2018, &quot;Buffalo&quot; conducted her inactivation ceremony, the final public event prior to the ship&#x27;s official decommissioning, which would occur within the access-controlled Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. &quot;Buffalo&quot; was decommissioned on 30 January 2019 and is currently pending disposal.

<text>USS &quot;Olympia&quot; (SSN-717) is a of the United States Navy. She is the 30th Los Angeles class nuclear powered fast attack submarine.

==Etymology==
&quot;Olympia&quot; is the second ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for Olympia, Washington.

==History==
The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 15 September 1977 and her keel was laid down on 31 March 1981. She was launched on 30 April 1983 sponsored by Mrs. Dorothy Williams, and commissioned on 17 November 1984.

&quot;Olympia&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 7 (SUBRON SEVEN) and was homeported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

In 1998, &quot;Olympia&quot; became the first Pacific-based submarine to pass through the Suez Canal in over 35 years.

<text>USS &quot;Honolulu&quot; (SSN-718), was a , and the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Honolulu, Hawaii. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 15 September 1977 and her keel was laid down on 10 November 1981. She was launched on 24 September 1983 sponsored by Mrs. Joan B. Clark, and commissioned on 6 July 1985, with Commander Robert M. Mitchell in command.

&quot;Honolulu&quot; featured unique split stern planes that operated from independent hydraulic systems. With this redundant configuration, the inboard and outboard planes could be operated independently, preventing a failure of one or the other from causing an uncontrolled dive.

&quot;Honolulu&quot;″s patrols were commemorated by ten surfboards signed by the crews aboard her at the time. The latest three were kept on board the submarine; the other seven are stored at Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Honolulu&quot; held a farewell ceremony in Pearl Harbor on 15 April 2006, that included remarks by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Lieutenant Governor Duke Aiona, U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Gary Roughead and former &quot;Honolulu&quot; commanding officer Vice Admiral Jonathan Greenert. &quot;Honolulu&quot; put to sea in early May 2006 for her final patrol. Her last patrol ended at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in October 2006 where she was placed on stand down, on her way to decommissioning.

==Disposition==

&quot;Honolulu&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 November 2007. Ex-&quot;Honolulu&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington.

The forward section of ex-&quot;Honolulu&quot; was transferred to , repairing extensive damage caused by a severe grounding &quot;San Francisco&quot; experienced in 2005. Despite difficulties, the unusual project was completed on 20 October 2008.

==In fiction and literature==
Although it had already been decommissioned, the submarine is featured prominently in the 2008 naval thriller, &quot;Black Sea Affair&quot;, by Don Brown.

<doc id="1121694" wikidata="Q3625727" url="?curid=1121694" title="World Fantasy Award—Life Achievement">
<text>The World Fantasy Awards are given each year by the World Fantasy Convention for the best fantasy fiction and fantasy art published in English during the preceding calendar year. The awards have been described by sources such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prestigious fantasy prize&quot;, and as one of the three most renowned speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). The World Fantasy Award—Life Achievement is given each year to individuals for their overall career in fields related to fantasy. These have included, for example, authors, editors, and publishers. The specific nomination reasons are not given, and nominees are not required to have retired, though they can only win once. The Life Achievement category has been awarded annually since 1975.

World Fantasy Award nominees are decided by attendees and judges at the annual World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner of each category. Unlike the other World Fantasy Award categories, the nominees for the Life Achievement award are not announced; instead, the winner is announced along with the nominees in the other categories. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy or horror authors, editors, publishers, booksellers, and others connected to the genres of fantasy and horror in some way and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Through 2015, winners were presented with a statuette of H. P. Lovecraft; more recent winners receive a statuette of a tree.

During the 49 nomination years, 79 people have been given the Life Achievement Award. Multiple winners have been awarded 25 times, typically two co-winners, though five were noted in 1984. Since 2000, it has become an unofficial tradition for two winners to be announced, often with one winner primarily an author and the other not. While most winners have been authors and editors, five winners have been primarily artists of fantasy art and book covers, and five winners are best known for founding or running publishing houses that produce fantasy works.

==Winners==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Items in the Work(s) column are items and companies that the winner created or worked at; they are meant to be representative of the winner&#x27;s career in the field of fantasy to that point, but the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement is not given for any specific achievement, and no such achievements are listed by the World Fantasy Convention as reasons for the award. In many cases the winner is well known for their non-fantasy works, such as science fiction novels, which are not listed.

<doc id="1121696" wikidata="Q39652" url="?curid=1121696" title="Robinson R22">
<text>The Robinson R22 is a two-seat, two-bladed, single-engined, light utility helicopter manufactured by Robinson Helicopter Company. It was designed in 1973 by Frank D. Robinson, and has been in production since 1979.

==Development==
The majority of flight testing was performed at Zamperini Field in Torrance, California. Flight testing and certification were performed in the late 1970s by test pilot Joseph John &quot;Tym&quot; Tymczyszyn, and the R22 received FAA certification in March 1979.
Due to relatively low acquisition and operating costs, the R22 has been popular as a primary rotorcraft trainer around the world, entry-level personal helicopter, and as a livestock-management tool on large ranches in North America and cattle stations in Australia.

The R22 has a very low-inertia rotor system and the control inputs are operated directly by push rods with no hydraulic assistance. Thus, its flight controls are very sensitive and require a light touch to avoid overcorrection, and students who master an R22 are usually well prepared to transition to heavier helicopters. Due to the specific training required by the low-inertia rotor system and a teetering main rotor, operation of the Robinson R22 or R44 in the US requires a special endorsement by a certified flight instructor. SFAR 73 includes discussion and training on energy management, mast bumping, low rotor RPM (blade stall), low G hazards and rotor RPM decay. Tip weights were added to the R22 to increase rotor inertia, but the small rotor limits weight.

The first R22 sold, October, 1979, S/N 003, N1010WR, was purchased by Pacific Wing and Rotor, Inc., represented by Tim Tucker who later became a test pilot and chief instructor for Robinson. S/N 001 was crashed in the ocean during certification testing due to a failure of the casting that mates the tail rotor gearbox and stabilizing fins to the conical monocoque aluminum tail boom and S/N 002 was used to complete the FAA certification. S/N 002, N32AD, is still owned by Robinson and is now preserved in the collection of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. 

By 2019, 4800 R22 had been made. 

===R22 cost===

Initially, Robinson projected the sale price in 1977 to be US$18-19,000. However, 3 months prior to initial deliveries starting in 1979, the price was raised to US$33,850. Per Tim Tucker, the sale price for S/N 003 including options was US$48,000, .

As of 15 January 2024, the R22 Beta II has a suggested retail price of US$375,000 (ex-factory price, USA) and the value on the second-hand market is dependent on component time in service. The estimated operating cost of a R22 Beta II, per the factory, including insurance, reserve for overhaul, and direct operating cost (fuel, oil, inspections, unscheduled maintenance) is US$189.87/hr when flown 500 hours per year.

Depreciation on a Robinson R22 is negligible, as freshly overhauled R22s typically sell for more than the original cost. However, a provision per flown hour must be made for a &quot;reserve for overhaul&quot; cost, currently estimated at US$90.42 per hour.

===Design===
The R22 is a light, two-place, single reciprocating-engined helicopter, with a semirigid, two-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed tail rotor. The main rotor has a teetering hinge and two coning hinges. The tail rotor has only a teetering hinge.

The normal production variant has skid landing gear. The Mariner version, no longer manufactured, provided floats. Wheeled gear is not available.

The basic structure is welded chromoly steel tubing. The forward fuselage is made of fiberglass and aluminum with a Plexiglas canopy. The tailcone and vertical and horizontal stabilizers are aluminum. It has an enclosed cabin with side-by-side seating for a pilot and passenger. The doors may be removed for flight, as is often done for photographic flights, interior cooling in high temperatures, or a 10.4 lb weight saving.

The first version was produced as the R22, followed by the R22 HP, R22 Alpha, R22 Beta, and R22 Beta II. Superficially, the aircraft appear similar. The R22 HP was fitted with a 160 bhp Lycoming O-320-B2C engine, an increase of over the original R22. The steel-tube frame on the R22 Alpha was modified by extending the aft landing-gear mounting points, giving it a slightly nose-down attitude on the ground and better matching of the skids to the ground in a low-altitude hover with two people on board. The R22 Beta added an engine speed governor (optional), rotor brake, and auxiliary fuel tank (optional). The battery was moved from below the instrument cluster to the engine compartment for better balance. The R22 has been offered as an instrument trainer version, with optional fixed floats as the R22 Mariner, and other special configurations for police work, electronic news gathering, and so on. The R22 Beta II received a larger Lycoming O-360 engine derated for sea-level operation. It allows greater altitudes for hovering in and out of ground effect (HIGE/HOGE). The R22 Beta II also made the engine speed governor standard and included a carburetor heat assist, which correlates adding carburetor heat with a decrease in collective control. Only the basic skid style is currently being sold.

===Controls===
Instead of floor-mounted cyclic sticks between the pilot&#x27;s knees, the R22 uses a unique teetering &quot;T-Bar&quot; control connected to a stick that emerges from the console between the seats. This makes it easier for occupants to enter and exit the cabin and reduces chances for injury in the event of a hard landing. The teetering bar has a hand grip on both sides that hangs down between the pilots&#x27; legs. Thus, if teetered to the right, the right-side pilot would be flying and the left grip would be about 12 inches above the left pilot&#x27;s lap. R22 flight instructors quickly learn how to fly with their hand in the air. The left part of the bar, left collective control, and left tail-rotor pedals can be removed if the left-seat occupant is not going to fly such as a non-rated pilot. A floor-mounted, foot-activated push-to-talk switch facilitates intercom communications for the left-seat occupant, although some later models may be equipped with a voice-activated intercom system.

The helicopter rotor system consists of a two-bladed main rotor and two-bladed antitorque rotor on the tail, each equipped with a teetering hinge. The main rotor rotates with the starboard (right) side blade moving forward. The main rotor is also equipped with two coning hinges. Collective and cyclic pitch inputs to the main rotor are transmitted through pushrods and a conventional swashplate mechanism. Control inputs to the tail rotor are transmitted through a single pushrod inside the aluminum tail cone.

To ease the pilot&#x27;s workload, a mechanical throttle correlator adjusts the throttle as the collective pitch control is raised or lowered. The pilot needs to make only small adjustments by twisting the throttle grip on the collective throughout the flight regime. Later models are also equipped with an electronic governor, which works to maintain engine speed within normal operating limits (between 97 and 104%); the governor is active when the engine is running only above 80% and is most effective in normal flight conditions. Robinson introduced the governor to ease pilot workload and to reduce instances of main rotor stall due to low rotor RPM. The governor can be switched on or off with a toggle switch located at the end of the pilot&#x27;s collective pitch control. When the governor is not engaged, a yellow caution light glows on the instrument panel.

===Powerplant===

The R22 uses a horizontally mounted Lycoming O-320 (O-360-J2A on the Beta II), flat-four, air-cooled, naturally aspirated, carburetor-equipped, reciprocating engine. It is fueled with 100LL grade aviation gasoline. JTI Air Holdings, Inc., offers an STC allowing use of 91+ octane non-ethanol automotive gasoline. Cooling is provided through a direct-drive, squirrel-cage cooling fan. At sea level, it is derated, or operated at less than maximum power, which has been attributed to the company wishing for the power unit to maintain the same performance at sea level as it does at altitude. As the air becomes thinner with increasing altitude, maximum available horsepower decreases, reaching a point where the throttle can be completely open and rotor speed is controlled by collective lever position. By derating the engine at sea level, the R22 achieves acceptable high-altitude performance without use of supercharging or turbocharging, thus saving the weight, cost, complexity, unreliability, and shortened engine life of a forced induction system.

A carburetor is used to provide the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most likely to occur in conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the &quot;dew point spread&quot;), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power, and if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control is used to supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective pitch control lever. Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a &quot;carburetor heat assist&quot;, which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective lever is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in Hg (457 mm Hg) of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in Hg of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the pilot&#x27;s operating handbook.

Power is transmitted from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multigroove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts sometimes rolled over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave by means of a belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.

A one-way sprag clutch is built into the center of the upper sheave to allow the rotor system to continue to rotate in the event of engine failure, allowing the R22 to enter autorotation and land in a controlled manner. Because the main rotor has very little mass and inertia, autorotation in an R22 requires careful and proper execution to assure a successful outcome. Much time is spent in training practicing various types of autorotation. Target speed in an autorotation is and the glide ratio is approximately 4:1 in maximum-glide configuration.

===Ground handling===
R22’s are equipped with wheel mounts toward the rear of the skids, one on each side, for attachment of removable wheels. The wheels must be removed prior to flight. These brackets are slightly behind the helicopter center of gravity so when the wheels are installed, the helicopter sits nose low. The wheel assembly has a pivot pin which is inserted into the skid-mounted bracket and then rotated over center to lift the rear of the skids about 2 inches leaving the front of the skids on the ground. The helicopter can be moved by pulling down on the tail to lift the front of the skids off the ground. One person can move the helicopter though this is difficult over any distance or on a sloped surface. Another person can help by pushing on the bracing behind the engine.

R22’s with flotation attached to the skids such as the Mariner or Mariner II must have wheels installed under the skids as the bracket is not accessible.

R22’s manufactured after 1991 include a ¾” diameter tow ball mounted on the bottom of the fuselage, near the front and offset slightly to the left. A tow cart or tug can be engaged with the ball and then used to lift the front of the helicopter to clear the skids from the ground after the wheels are installed and rotated to lift the rear of the skids. This makes it possible for a single person to move the helicopter, even over significant distances or not-level surfaces.

Tow carts are available with a variety of features. There exist manual versions which place the ball mating device behind the wheels so the operator engages the ball then pushes down on the handle to lift the nose. Others provide a repurposed car-style hydraulic jack to lift the nose. Others provide an electric jack. 

Tow carts are available with no motive power, a gas engine or one or two electric motors operated from one or two batteries. Some of the non-powered tow carts are set up to be towed such as behind a golf cart or quad cycle. One manufacturer offered a modified pallet jack.

The other option for ground handling is a landing platform which is large enough for the helicopter to safely land on, has wheels underneath and can be towed between the hangar and the take-off location. These are heavy and must be towed with a vehicle. R22’s are light enough to move they are rarely loaded onto platforms.

===Transport===
The two-bladed rotor and the small size of the R22 make transporting the helicopter without blade folding or dismantling tasks possible. Transporting the R22 requires securing the tail boom and rotor blades to a truck or trailer bed, which must be torsionally rigid to prevent motion and stresses being applied to the helicopter during transportation. Take off and landing directly onto a trailer is possible.

===Unmanned derivatives===
The R22 is the basis for Boeing&#x27;s Maverick military unmanned aerial vehicle helicopter, and its Renegade version. In 1999, Frontier Systems developed a remotely piloted R22, the Maverick. This aircraft, along with the company, was later acquired by Boeing Phantom Works. In 2003, the United States Navy purchased four aircraft, equipped with Wescam electro-optical/infrared systems.

Boeing then modified one of the Mavericks further, calling it the Renegade, under contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency as a research testbed to develop software for its A160 Hummingbird. The software system, known as the software enabled control (SEC) program, was developed by Boeing and teams from the University of California, Berkeley, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and was first flown on May 26, 2005. During the flight, the SEC assumed control of the aircraft to &quot;execute autonomous maneuvering algorithms&quot;. The software allows the aircraft to autonomously select &quot;optimal routes through a field of pop-up and known threats; flying low-level, terrain-hugging profiles to avoid detection; and determining safe landing zones using vision-based algorithms to process landing site imagery and terrain height information.&quot;

==Operators==

The R22 is operated by many private individuals, companies, and flying clubs. In Australia, where 489 R22s were registered as of mid-2011, a survey found that 62% of the fleet&#x27;s flying time was in mustering operations, while 13% of hours were spent in training pilots. Many broadcasters used the R22 until the mid-1990s, when the financial landscape of radio broadcasting in the U.S. changed due to deregulation of the industry.

== Accidents and incidents ==
Since the R22 received FAA certification in March 1979, Robinson has delivered 4,800 R22 helicopters up to 2019. The R22 had 182 fatal accidents between March 1979 and June 2010 from a total of 1,230 incidents. In late 1981, the R22 had its type certificate temporarily revoked by the Federal Aviation Administration due to delamination of a main rotor blade. The cause of the delamination was determined to be contamination of one of the bonded parts during a priming operation performed at an outside vendor. In response, Robinson Helicopter Company instituted stringent quality procedures and requirements, and replaced all main rotor blades on the fleet of 33 helicopters in service at the time.

In the early 1980s, the R22 experienced a number of student-pilot related accidents due to the R22&#x27;s use as a primary flight trainer. Believing the number of accidents was the result of insufficient training and lax standards, Robinson established the Robinson Pilot Safety Course in 1982 to educate Certified Flight Instructors transitioning from larger helicopters to the new, smaller R22. After the introduction of the Robinson Pilot Safety Course, the rate of fatal R22 accidents declined from 3.7 per 100,000 flight hours in 1983 to 0.97 per 100,000 flight hours for the 12 months preceding July 1995. Robinson&#x27;s statistics show the rate of fatal R22 accidents per 100,000 flight hours fell from 6.0 in 1982 to 0.7 in 1997. As of 2012, more than 17,000 students have gone through the course.

On April 11, 2024 a Robinson R22 helicopter of the Philippine Navy crashed near a public market in Cavite City in the Philippines while on a training flight, killing its two pilots. It was the last R22 model helicopter in the inventory of the Philippine Navy.
