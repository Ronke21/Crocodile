<text>Acilisene (), known as Ekegheats or Yekeghyats () in Armenian, was a region of the Upper Armenia province of historical Armenia. It was a strip of land along the Upper Euphrates or Arsanias roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s Erzincan Province of Turkey. Its main cities were Erznka (today&#x27;s Erzincan, Turkey) and Ani-Kamakh (today&#x27;s Kemah, Turkey) near the ancient necropolis of the Arsacid kings of Armenia.

The Erznka valley, crossed by the Upper Euphrates, was the location of the most important pre-Christian shrine in Armenia, dedicated to the Armenian goddess Anahit. The temple, whose site has not yet been identified, was in a settlement called Erez. Because of its association with the goddess, the region was also called (&#x27;of Anahit&#x27;, corresponding to the Latin , itself from , the name of the goddess in Latin and Greek classical sources). 

Under the Arsacid dynasty, it was one of the properties of the house of Gregory the Illuminator (the Gregorids) and was sometimes called (&#x27;district of the Illuminator&#x27;).

<text>Stanisław Kania (; 8 March 1927 – 3 March 2020) was a Polish communist politician who served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic as First Secretary of the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) between September 1980 and October 1981.

==Early life and career==
Stanisław Kania was born on 8 March 1927 in Wrocanka, Jasło County in the Second Polish Republic into a working class family. Kania joined the Peasant Battalions in 1944 at 17 years-old and the Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) in April 1945, when the Germans were driven out of Poland by the Red Army and Polish communists began to take control of the country. He partook in campaigns organised by the PPR, such as the Volunteer Reserve of the Citizens&#x27; Militia and the 1946 Polish people&#x27;s referendum. Kania became deputy representative of the constituency for Jasło County and in February 1947 he was elected chairman of the Union of Youth Struggle (ZWM) board in Jasło. In December he was appointed head of the Rural Youth Department in Rzeszów. In 1948, the 21-year-old Kania was elected as delegate to the unification congress of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR). He attended courses at the PZPR&#x27;s party school from 1950 to 1952 and was appointed head of the Rural Youth Department and to the main board of the ZWM. Kania was active in the Warsaw Provincial Committee from 1957 and became its Secretary in September 1960, a position he would hold until November 1968.

Kania was elected a deputy member of the Central Committee of the PZPR in June 1964 before being elected a full member in November 1968. He was appointed head of the Central Committee&#x27;s Administrative Department until becoming Secretary of the Central Committee in April 1971. Kania was elected to the Politburo of the PZPR in December 1975, effectively making him one of the most powerful men in Poland.

==First Secretary==
On 6 September 1980, Kania was elected First Secretary when Edward Gierek was forced to resign for signing the Gdańsk Agreement with the Solidarity amidst much social and economic unrest in Poland. Gierek&#x27;s actions were seen by some within the PZPR leadership as an attempt to renounce communism, and he was subsequently removed from power. Kania, having been the Central Committee&#x27;s Secretary for most of Gierek&#x27;s rule and a critic of his economic policies, was chosen to replace him. He admitted that the party had made many economic mistakes, advocated working with Catholic and trade unionist opposition groups, and met with Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa and other critics of the PZPR. Kania&#x27;s attempts at reconciliation with opposition groups in Poland were largely unsuccessful, losing the confidence of both the party and the public. 

Kania resigned as First Secretary in October 1981, when a bug planted by the KGB caught him criticizing the Soviet leadership, and was succeeded by General Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) and Minister of National Defence. 

==Later life and death==
In 2012, Kania was tried for his role in Jaruzelski&#x27;s imposition of martial law in Poland in December 1981, but he was acquitted.

Kania died on 3 March 2020 of pneumonia and heart failure, five days before his 93rd birthday. At the time of his death, he was one of the last surviving leaders of a former Eastern Bloc country.

<text>Santiago Hernán Solari Poggio (born 7 October 1976) is an Argentine professional football manager and former player who played as a left midfielder.

He spent the better part of his 16-year professional career in Spain, amassing La Liga totals of 177 matches and 17 goals mainly with Real Madrid, but also played in Italy for Inter Milan, winning 13 major titles between both teams.

Solari began working as a coach in 2013, going on to spend several years associated with Real Madrid in different capacities.

==Playing career==
===Club===
====Early career and River====
Born in Rosario, Santa Fe, Solari played youth football for Newell&#x27;s Old Boys and Renato Cesarini, after returning from the United States where he attended Richard Stockton College in New Jersey. He joined River Plate midway through the 1995–96 season, making his Primera División debut on 12 May.

Solari appeared in 24 league games in his first full campaign, helping River to both the Apertura and Clausura tournaments.

====Atlético Madrid====
Solari moved to Spain late in the 1999 January transfer window, signing with Atlético Madrid. He played his first La Liga game on 7 February, in a 2–1 away loss against Salamanca.

Solari had his best individual season in 1999–2000 when he scored six goals in 34 matches, but the &quot;Colchoneros&quot; were relegated from the top division.

====Real Madrid====
Subsequently, Solari moved across the city to join Real Madrid, who paid Atlético his buyout clause of 600 million pesetas. After a poor first season he became a regular, albeit as a substitute; in the final of the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League, in which he played the full 90 minutes, he was involved in the play that led to Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s wonder strike against Bayer Leverkusen, in an eventual 2–1 win.

Solari&#x27;s best season with Real was 2003–04, but his five goals from 34 appearances – 15 starts, 1,539 minutes of action – could only help the side to the fourth position in the league. During his five-year spell he also played 49 matches in the Champions League, netting seven times.

====Inter and later years====
Solari signed a three-year contract with Inter Milan in the summer of 2005 for €6 million, being sparingly used during his three-year stint (maximum 21 games in his second season) but winning three consecutive Serie A titles to add to his trophy cabinet, the 2006 edition due to the Calciopoli scandal.

On 30 June 2008, Solari&#x27;s contract with the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; expired and he joined San Lorenzo shortly after. On 9 July of the following year, he moved teams and countries again and signed with Atlante from Mexico, again on a free transfer.

In early September 2010, the 34-year-old Solari signed with Uruguayan club Peñarol for one year, yet again as a free agent. He retired after only a couple of months.

===International===
Solari made eleven appearances for the Argentina national football team in five years, but was not selected for any major international tournaments.

==Coaching career==
===Real Madrid===
Solari started working as a manager in 2013, first being in charge of Real Madrid&#x27;s youths. Ahead of the 2016–17 season, he was appointed at the reserves who competed in Segunda División B.

On 29 October 2018, Solari was named caretaker manager of the first team after the dismissal of Julen Lopetegui. He assumed the role the next day, and became the official coach 14 days later because in Spain no club was allowed to have a caretaker for more than two weeks. He won the FIFA Club World Cup during his tenure, extending Real&#x27;s reign in the competition to three consecutive titles.

Solari was sacked on 11 March 2019, following a humiliating elimination from the UEFA Champions League by Ajax.

===Club América===
On 29 December 2020, Solari was unveiled as the new manager of Club América from Mexico after signing a two-year contract, replacing the fired Miguel Herrera. He did not obtain his work permit in time, and as a result could not be on the sideline for the team&#x27;s opening match of the season against Atlético San Luis. He made his Liga MX debut the following week in a 1–0 away defeat to Monterrey, and earned his first win against Juárez on 26 January. He led the side to a second-place finish in the general table, but was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Pachuca.

América began the Apertura 2021 tournament with four victories and one draw from five matches, taking Solari&#x27;s total tally with the club to 18 wins from his first 27 games, tying the mark set by Leo Beenhakker during the 1994–95 campaign. He guided them to the final of the CONCACAF Champions League in late October, losing 1–0 to Monterrey. The team finished the Apertura regular phase first in the table with 37 points, though once again falling at the quarter-final stage, being ousted by Club Universidad Nacional 3–1 on aggregate; they had managed to remain unbeaten at home throughout the 2021 calendar year (winning 13 and drawing three).

Solari was dismissed on 2 March 2022, after a poor run of results, departing after eight games in the Grita México Clausura 2022.

==Style of play==
A dynamic and versatile left-footed winger, with excellent technical ability, Solari was mainly known for his dribbling skills, although he was also an accurate passer and was capable of striking the ball from distance with both feet.

==Broadcasting==
Since 2010, Solari worked as pundit for ESPN.

==Personal life==

Nicknamed &quot;Indiecito&quot; (&quot;Little Indian&quot; in Spanish), Solari came from a sporting family: his uncle Jorge, his father Eduardo and two of his four siblings, younger Esteban and David, were also footballers. His younger sister, Liz, worked as an actress. He is of Spanish and Italian descent.

His uncle Jorge played for several clubs during his career, mostly River Plate, whilst his cousin Natalia married Fernando Redondo who also represented Real Madrid. All but David played for Argentina.

<text>The Special Service Medal () was a decoration of South Vietnam which was issued between the years of 1950 and 1974. The decoration was awarded to any military service member who performed an act of outstanding meritorious service to the Vietnamese State. The Special Service Medal was also awarded to members of foreign militaries and was presented frequently to members of the United States Armed Forces during the years of the Vietnam War.

The U.S. military considered the Special Service Medal to be the equivalent of the Bronze Star. When awarded to U.S. personnel, the decoration was permitted for wear on U.S. uniforms after all United States military awards.

In 1975, with the fall of Saigon, the South Vietnamese military effectively ceased to exist and the Special Service Medal became obsolete. Today, it is only available by private purchase through military insignia dealers.

<doc id="1116074" wikidata="Q531154" url="?curid=1116074" title="Dirty (Sonic Youth album)">
<text>Dirty is the seventh full-length studio album and second double album by American rock band Sonic Youth, released on July 21, 1992, by DGC Records. The band recorded and co-produced the album with Butch Vig in early 1992 at the Magic Shop recording studios. The sound on &quot;Dirty&quot; was inspired by the popularity of grunge music at the time, and has been described by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as experimental rock.

&quot;Dirty&quot; reached number 83 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number six on the UK Albums Chart. The album spawned four singles: the lead single &quot;100%&quot; charted well, but was not the crossover hit the label anticipated, followed by &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot;, which did not chart as well. The last two were &quot;Sugar Kane&quot; and &quot;Drunken Butterfly&quot;, with the former performing better commercially than the latter. In support of the album, Sonic Youth embarked on the &quot;Pretty Fucking Dirty&quot; tour of 1992 and 1993, where they played most of the album during sets. In late 1992, they toured North America, and in early 1993, they toured New Zealand and Australia and released the &quot;Whores Moaning&quot; EP, which featured most of the &quot;Sugar Kane&quot; B-sides.

== Background ==

Following the release of &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; in 1988, Sonic Youth were interested in signing with a major record label. By the middle of 1989, the top contenders for the band&#x27;s new label were A&amp;M Records, Atlantic Records and Mute Records. Between late 1989 and early 1990, Geffen Records announced its interest in signing the band. Sonic Youth eventually signed a five-album deal with Geffen for an estimated $300,000. However, the band was disappointed when they discovered that the albums would be released on the newly created Geffen sub-label, DGC Records.

In 1990, the band released &quot;Goo&quot;, which achieved moderate commercial success, peaking at No. 96 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States and charting in the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Critical reception to the album was positive. To support its release, Sonic Youth toured Europe and North America twice in 1990. Preceding the mainstream breakthrough of alternative rock and grunge, the band toured Europe again in late summer 1991 with Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr, Babes in Toyland and Gumball. On this tour, they premiered &quot;Orange Rolls, Angel&#x27;s Spit&quot; and &quot;Chapel Hill&quot;, both of which would later appear on &quot;Dirty&quot;. The latter tour was chronicled in the documentary &quot;1991: The Year Punk Broke&quot;, directed by Dave Markey. In November, the group began recording demos at their rehearsal space in Hoboken, New Jersey.

== Recording ==
For &quot;Dirty&quot;, Sonic Youth worked with producer Butch Vig and mixer Andy Wallace, who both had worked in the same roles on Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, although this was not why the band chose them. On the album&#x27;s sound, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; would later opine that &quot;they weren&#x27;t entirely catering to the new ears Nirvana&#x27;s success was sending their way&quot;, but &quot;were at least taking it into consideration on a semi-conscious level&quot;. During his first meeting with the group, Vig told the band that he wanted to tighten the song arrangements and focus on crafting the guitar sounds. Vig quickly landed the producer job for the record. During a visit to the apartment of Sonic Youth members Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, Moore told Vig that he wanted the album to sound like a Mecht Mensch single that Vig had produced.

The band sent a series of cassette tapes to Vig in late 1991, featuring their new compositions. Vig was pleased with the material but also uncertain about how to handle it, as the tapes consisted of long instrumentals with unclear song structures. The second batch of cassettes that Vig received demonstrated that the band had performed some self-editing with its compositions. Vig moved to New York City for three months in early 1992 and the band began recording the album at the Magic Shop in March. Ian MacKaye of Fugazi contributed guest guitar on &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot;. The last song on the album, &quot;Crème Brûlée&quot;, was recorded by guitarist Lee Ranaldo while Gordon was playing guitar and singing, drummer Steve Shelley was playing the drums, and Moore was trying to turn on his amplifier.

After recording was completed, the album needed to be trimmed down from eighteen completed tracks. Moore, Gordon and the band&#x27;s A&amp;R representative, Gary Gersh, agreed that Ranaldo&#x27;s song &quot;Genetic&quot; would be removed. Ranaldo did not react well to the decision; coupled with personal issues he was facing at the time, it led him to consider leaving the group. &quot;Genetic&quot; and Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Hendrix Necro&quot; were instead featured on the &quot;100%&quot; single. Another track recorded during the sessions, &quot;Stalker&quot;, was added to the album&#x27;s vinyl release.

== Lyrics and themes ==
The songs &quot;100%&quot; and &quot;JC&quot; were written about the murder of Joe Cole, a roadie and friend of the band, and how it affected the band. The next song, &quot;Swimsuit Issue&quot;, is about a then-current Geffen employee who was remanded to therapy for sexual harassment, hence the lyrics &quot;Don&#x27;t touch my breast, I&#x27;m just working at my desk.&quot; The last section of the song features Gordon naming all of the models in the March 1992 &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;. The lyrics to &quot;Drunken Butterfly&quot; were taken wholly from song titles and lyrics of Heart songs, and the track was originally titled &quot;Barracuda&quot; after a Heart song. The final title was taken from Heart song &quot;Dog &amp; Butterfly&quot;, which sounds a bit like &quot;drunken butterfly&quot;. &quot;Sugar Kane&quot; is said to be about Marilyn Monroe, and is named after her character in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;. &quot;Chapel Hill,&quot; one of the first songs written for the album, is about the murder of Internationalist Books owner Bob Sheldon in Carrboro, North Carolina.

== Packaging ==
The front cover of the album, a photograph taken by Gordon&#x27;s longtime friend Mike Kelley, depicted an orange stuffed toy with Sonic Youth written down the sides. The theme continued through the CD booklet with pictures of a teddy bear, rabbit and other plush animals. The credits were also included in the booklet. The back cover featured images of individual members of the band along with the track listing. The vinyl version differed, with the back cover featuring the stuffed toys and the band photos in the inserts. Some versions of the CD have a &quot;dirty picture&quot; of Bob Flanagan and Sheree Rose defiling stuffed toys while naked.

== Release ==
Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Sonic Youth undertook a short Northeast tour in which most of &quot;Dirty&quot; was premiered. &quot;Dirty&quot; was released on July 21, 1992, on double LP vinyl, CD and Cassette. The LP version of the album came with an extra track titled &quot;Stalker&quot;. The album hit No. 6 in the UK Albums Chart (their highest charting album in the UK) and No. 83 in the US. In the wake of the success of Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, DGC pushed &quot;Dirty&quot; heavily. In the same month as the album was issued, &quot;100%&quot; was released as a single, but was not the crossover hit the label anticipated. Geffen executive Mark Kates admitted it &quot;was not a great radio song&quot;; however, the song was popular on alternative and college radio, reaching No. 4 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs and No. 28 in the UK Singles Chart. In September, the band appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, performing &quot;100%&quot;. At the urging of Kates, &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot; was released in December as the album&#x27;s second single. The single did not sell well or receive airplay (though it did chart at No. 52 in the UK), and Kates referred to the decision as &quot;one of the biggest professional mistakes of my life&quot;.

In late 1992, the band began their &quot;Pretty Fucking Dirty&quot; tour, starting in North America. All of the songs from &quot;Dirty&quot; were played at least once, except for &quot;Crème Brûlée&quot;. They also played &quot;Genetic,&quot; but occasionally swapped it for &quot;Eric&#x27;s Trip&quot; or &quot;Mote&quot;. They changed the setlists frequently, but kept &quot;Shoot&quot; as the opener. In November and December, they toured Europe, also appearing on &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot; to perform &quot;Drunken Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Sugar Kane&quot; and &quot;JC&quot;. In January and February 1993, Sonic Youth toured Australia and New Zealand, and released the &quot;Sugar Kane&quot; single, which performed much better than &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot;, reaching No. 26 in the UK Singles Chart. The same month, they released the &quot;Whores Moaning&quot; Australia-only EP to coincide with the tour. The EP included the &quot;Sugar Kane&quot; B-sides along with the track &quot;Tamra&quot;. The last single from the album, &quot;Drunken Butterfly&quot;, was released in August 1993 in Germany only.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Dirty&quot; was generally well-received by critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the album, calling it &quot;possibly the finest hour (59 minutes, actually) from this New York noise &amp; roll band. It is also much-needed proof that the old-fangled concept of a rock guitar band can still result in vital, undeniably moving music&quot;, and ending the review with, &quot;At this point, every other rock &amp; roll album that visits our planet this year will have a hard time topping [&quot;Dirty&quot;]&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined that &quot;Dirty&quot; &quot;easily rank[s] with &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; and &quot;Sister&quot;&quot; as &quot;the band&#x27;s most unified and unforgettable recorded works&quot;.

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; saw &quot;Dirty&quot; as a big improvement over &quot;Goo&quot;, which it felt had &quot;fail[ed] miserably&quot;. AllMusic would later call it &quot;a damn good rock album, and on those terms it ranks with Sonic Youth&#x27;s best work&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Dirty&quot; was deemed the best album of 1992 by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

== Music videos ==
The first music video from &quot;Dirty&quot; was for &quot;100%&quot;. It was directed by Tamra Davis and Spike Jonze, and shot in Los Angeles. Much of the video footage was shot by Jonze while riding on a skateboard, following others in the streets (including then-skateboarder, now-actor Jason Lee). The video also alluded to the shooting death of Cole, but is not specifically about him, and more about friendship between two skateboarders. Sonic Youth is shown playing a house party throughout the film. In the video, Gordon plays a yellow Fender bass guitar which she had borrowed from actor Keanu Reeves.

The second music video, for &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot;, was directed by Nick Egan. The video was shot in the concrete flood control channel of the Los Angeles River with the band playing while FMX bikers ride around. Imagery of fascism, Nazism and communism was spliced into the video, plus an insurrection mixed with pictures of punk bands and fashion.

The third music video was for &quot;Sugar Kane&quot;; like &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot;, it was directed by Egan. The video was shot in New York City and portrayed Sonic Youth performing in the midst of a fashion show that showcased &quot;grunge&quot; clothing. The clothing, in fact, was one of the collections (&quot;Grunge Collection&quot;) done by Marc Jacobs for Perry Ellis in 1992. Jacobs was a close friend of Gordon and the band. The video also marked the first film appearance of Chloë Sevigny.

The fourth video from &quot;Dirty&quot; was for &quot;Drunken Butterfly&quot;, directed by Stephen Hellweg, the winner of an MTV &quot;120 Minutes&quot; contest in which fans were asked to send in videos for any song on &quot;Dirty&quot;. It featured puppets and dolls made up to look like Sonic Youth performing the song onstage. The fifth (for &quot;Swimsuit Issue&quot;, which featured shirtless men smoking together in a room listening to &quot;Dirty&quot;) and sixth (for &quot;Nic Fit&quot;, showing someone running around in a field holding up a flaming stuffed animal) videos stemmed from the same contest.

<doc id="1116077" wikidata="Q7208006" url="?curid=1116077" title="Point Defiance Park">
<text>Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, Washington, United States, is a large urban park. The park includes Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium, the Rose Garden, Rhododendron Garden, beaches, trails, a boardwalk, a boathouse, a Washington State Ferries ferry dock for the Point Defiance-Tahlequah route to Vashon Island, Fort Nisqually, an off-leash dog park, and most notably about 400 acres of old-growth forest. It receives more than three million visitors every year. Point Defiance Park is maintained and operated by Metro Parks Tacoma.

==Wildlife==
Point Defiance Park offers something for all its visitors, both wildlife and people. Not all the wild animals are confined inside Zoo &amp; Aquarium. From high bluffs overlooking the Tacoma Narrows people can watch bald eagles feed on salmon runs passing through on the strong tidal currents. Their calls can be heard from their nests in the old growth forest that is preserved and make up the northern of the park.

In winter, sea lions migrating from California feed in the swirling tides beneath the Gig Harbor overlook on the northernmost point of the peninsula. Harbor seals are abundant near on the east facing beach approaching the point. Seal pups are frequently observed north of Owen Beach in late summer and early fall (humans and their dogs should keep their distance to avoid spooking the pups). The park also provides habitat for mule deer, red foxes, coyotes, pileated woodpeckers, Douglas squirrels, and raccoons. Point Defiance’s beaches and bluffs are also a good place to spot the occasional humpback whale or orca.

==History==
Point Defiance Park began as a military reservation after the Wilkes Expedition visited Puget Sound in the 1840s to map the bays and estuaries. Wilkes is thought to have said that with a fort positioned at the point, and at Gig Harbor across the narrows, one could &quot;defy&quot; the world. The high cliffs and prominent location were never used for military operations. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland authorized its use as a public park. By 1890, streetcars brought visitors to wander among the gardens. In 1903, a waterfront pavilion was completed. By 1907 a seaside resort designed by Frederick Heath offered heated saltwater bathing in a pavilion called the Nereides Baths located on a bluff above the boathouse.

Fort Nisqually is a replica of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s presence in the region in the 19th century when the English trading company had trading forts stretching from Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River, Fort Nisqually on south Puget Sound near the Nisqually River and continuing to the Far North to Fort Yukon on the Yukon River in Canadian territory which later became the state of Alaska.

In recent years, Fort Nisqually programs invite community members, including local tribal members, to a weekend of re-enacting — in period dress — this early period of trade and travel through the region by dugout cedar canoe.

In 2019, the city&#x27;s second-division soccer team renamed itself to Tacoma Defiance in reference to the park.

The park opened Frank Herbert Trail and Dune Peninsula in July 2019 to honor science fiction writer Frank Herbert, known for his &quot;Dune&quot; novels, who was born in Tacoma. The American Planning Association designated Point Defiance Park as a 2011 Great American Place. 

In 1964, Point Defiance Park was home to the fairytale and nursery rhyme based attraction known as Never Never Land. Created by Alfred Petterson, the park featured various figurine characters from fables such as Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, and the Little Red Riding Hood. The park brought in visitors until 2001 when Metro Parks shut down operations. In September 2021, nearly a decade after several figurines were destroyed in an arson fire, they were put up for auction. The money that was raised was used to support Metro Parks&#x27;s historical assets and public art.

== Features/Recreation ==

===Formal Gardens===
The gardens remain today. Visitors find a Japanese Garden, Rose Garden, and Dahlia gardens surrounding the former superintendent&#x27;s home. The home was built in 1898 in the year of the Yukon Gold Rush. The gardens are located near the park&#x27;s main entrance on the approach to the Zoo &amp; Aquarium. It is sited on a bluff looking down on a waterfront containing the boathouse, Anthony&#x27;s Restaurant and Washington State Ferry landing providing access to Vashon Island. Other public gardens on site include the Native Plant, Herb, Fuchsia, and Iris gardens.

The prominent feature of the Japanese Garden is the Pagoda, built in 1914 as a streetcar station. When buses replaced street cars throughout the West, the Pagoda became a waiting area for buses in 1938. In 1963 it was transformed into a center for flower shows and social gatherings. The Pagoda and Lodge were refurbished in 1988. The Pagoda and Lodge are rented throughout the year for weddings and receptions.
In 2011 the Pagoda was heavily damaged in an arson fire but beautifully restored. The Pagoda in 2001 was also the prior home of the figurines from Never Never Land before the arson fire.

===Brownfields and boating facilities===
After a century of depositing slag into the waters of Puget Sound, Asarco&#x27;s Tacoma Smelter created a peninsula to form the park&#x27;s protected harbor. The Tacoma Yacht Club and Dune Peninsula Park sit on the peninsula&#x27;s promontory as a guardian of snug harbor. A public boat launch at the entrance of the harbor is part of the park&#x27;s recreational facilities.

===Zoo &amp; Aquarium===
Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium is a 1.1 mile 4 minute drive from the Pearl Street entrance to Point Defiance Park. Roughly 15 minutes walking.
===Science and Math Institute===
In the fall of 2009, Tacoma Public Schools opened the Science and Math Institute (SAMI), a science- and math-centered magnet high school within Point Defiance Park. SAMI features classes on the beach, pagoda, forests, and Zoo. Metro Parks was approached by the school district and gave them space for portable classrooms on the site of the recently evicted Camp 6 Logging Museum. The school has a concept and schedule similar to the district&#x27;s other Magnet high school, Tacoma School of the Arts (TSOTA). The SAMI institute features classes on natural sciences and mathematics. SAMI is an early introductory to the STEM classes and possible school routes and lifestyles.

===Landscapes and activities===
In addition to old-growth forest with 450-year-old Douglas fir (Mountaineer Tree) are 250-foot vertical bluffs exposing rich geology. Groups and individuals regularly gather at the park for picnics, weddings, organized runs, and other special events. In 2022 Five Mile Drive’s outer loop became pedestrian and bicycle only. The park has an off-leash dog park; fee-based attractions include Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium and Fort Nisqually.

As the largest urban park in Pierce County, the network of roads and trails weaving through the forest preserve provides a quiet retreat for joggers, cyclists, and hikers. Trails are marked with symbols. The outer loop of Five Mile Drive was permanently closed to cars in 2022, creating a quieter experience on pedestrian forest trails and a more carefree path for bikes and pedestrians on the paved road. There are many hiking trails along Pt. Defiance&#x27;s bluffs and through its forest, including trails with sweeping views of Vashon Island, Dalco Passage, Gig Harbor, and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The road network also passes by Fort Nisqually.

On Owen Beach you can find kayakers, people fishing, and beach goers. The Marina is a common place for fishing year round. Chinook salmon and squid are two of the most popular catches during the fall.

The Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium is open year round.

From 1964 to 2010, the Camp 6 Logging Museum operated in the park.

==Community involvement==
Tacomans appealed to President Grover Cleveland in 1888 to repurpose Point Defiance from a military reserve to a park; in 1905 President Theodore Roosevelt signed legislation giving city full title to park. The park&#x27;s first superintendent, Ebenezer Roberts, asked schoolchildren in 1895 to donate rose clippings to start a rose garden; today gardens have expanded to include native plants, herbs, iris, dahlia, and fuchsia; volunteers contribute time and plants. Citywide 2005 Park Bond Program provides $5.5 million to improve Point Defiance Park; projects include restoration of the Pagoda, trail maintenance, soil decontamination and converting mowed turf to habitat plantings. More than 1,500 citizens have engaged in the park&#x27;s 2005 Park Improvement Bond planning since the process began in 2008.

<text>Vahevuni was one of the ancient noble houses of Armenia, believed to derive from Vahagn, god (dic) of fire and war. According to Movses Khorenatsi, the Vahevunis were ranked in the Gahnamak among the first noble houses of Armenian by King Valarshak.

The princely house of Vahevunis traditionally held the title of the high priests (qrmapet) of Vahagn. They also possessed the temple town of Ashtishat in the gavarr of Vahevuniq (on the left bank of the Aratzani river in Taron. Most likely, in the pre-Christian Armenia, the Vahevunis also hereditarily held the rank of the Sparapet, i.e. the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armenian Army.

The main known rulers from the Vahevuni family from c. 400–800 are:
*Mani Vahevuni c. 445
*Gyut Vahevuni c. 445
*Barshegh (Baršł) Vahevuni c. 480
*Samvel Vahevuni c. 590
*Khosrov c. 595

<text>Vanand () is the area of historic Armenia that roughly corresponds to the Kars Province of present-day Turkey. Named after the Armenian family of Vanandi (derived from the Bulgar chieftain Vund), it was a principality of the Kingdom of Armenia and a later province of the Democratic Republic of Armenia. Its historic capital was the city of Kars. The region fell to numerous invaders including the Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Mongols, Persians, and the Ottoman Turks. After the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War, the Russian Empire acquired the region at the Congress of Berlin. The area still retained a substantial Armenian population, but after World War I, most of it was decimated during the Turkish-Armenian War in 1920. This region was passed to Turkish control by the Treaty of Alexandropol and the Treaty of Kars.

<doc id="1116088" wikidata="Q418139" url="?curid=1116088" title="Esmolol">
<text>Esmolol, sold under the brand name Brevibloc, is a cardio selective beta1 receptor blocker with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilising activity at therapeutic dosages.

It is a class II antiarrhythmic. Esmolol decreases the force and rate of heart contractions by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system, which are found in the heart and other organs of the body. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine.
It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1987.

==Medical uses==
To terminate supraventricular tachycardia,

Episodic atrial fibrillation or flutter,

Arrhythmia during anaesthesia,

To reduce HR and BP during and after cardiac surgery, and

In early treatment of myocardial infarction.

Esmolol is also used in blunting the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Esmolol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is selective for the β1-adrenergic receptor and has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Esmolol is considered a soft drug, one that is rapidly metabolized to an inactive form. Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol&#x27;s short duration of action is based on the ester-methyl side chain which allows for quick hydrolysis. Esmolol&#x27;s structure is reflected in its name, es-molol as in ester-methyl. Plasma cholinesterases and red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase do not have any action. This metabolism results in the formation of a free acid and methanol. The amount of methanol produced is similar to endogenous methanol production. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about two minutes and an elimination half-life of about nine minutes.

Esmolol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects.

<doc id="1116091" wikidata="Q5314755" url="?curid=1116091" title="Dundas Cactus Festival">
<text>The Dundas Cactus Festival occurs on the third weekend of August in Dundas, Ontario, Canada. The midway is opened on Wednesday and with King Street blocked off from York Road to Market Street, there is a parade on Thursday evening.

Following that, from Friday to Sunday, there are live musicians, buskers, arts &amp; crafts, games, vendors and even some charity gambling to entertain the public.

==History==
The Dundas Cactus Festival began in 1976 as a festival to mark the beginning of summer. In 1979 the festival was moved to August with local downtown merchants having sidewalk sales to coincide with it.

The name &#x27;Dundas Cactus Festival&#x27; is inspired by the activities of Barend (Ben) Veldhuis, a Dutch immigrant who ran a large greenhouse specializing in cacti, who was the reason Dundas became known as &quot;the cactus capital of the universe&quot;.

<text>The House of Paluni was a dynastic house in Greater Armenia from the fourth to the sixth century AD.

The princes of Paluni occupied a remnant of the territorial dominion of the people of Lope or Puli, found in the Hittite annals, situated between Astyan and Taron, a domain that became named for them (the Balabitene occupied another remnant of that territory). The Paluni seem to have become part of the Mamikonian-ruled Taron, and then emigrated to Vaspurakan, which it named for itself. It disappeared soon after the start of the sixth century.

<doc id="1116109" wikidata="Q3021669" url="?curid=1116109" title="Delimiter-separated values">
<text>Formats that use delimiter-separated values (also DSV) store two-dimensional arrays of data by separating the values in each row with specific delimiter characters. Most database and spreadsheet programs are able to read or save data in a delimited format. Due to their wide support, DSV files can be used in data exchange among many applications.

A delimited text file is a text file used to store data, in which each line represents a single book, company, or other thing, and each line has fields separated by the delimiter.
Compared to the kind of flat file that uses spaces to force every field to the same width, a delimited file has the advantage of allowing field values of any length.

== Delimited formats ==

Any character may be used to separate the values, but the most common delimiters are the comma, tab, and colon. The vertical bar (also referred to as &quot;pipe&quot;) and space are also sometimes used. Column headers are sometimes included as the first line, and each subsequent line is a row of data. The lines are separated by newlines.

For example, the following fields in each record are delimited by commas, and each record by newlines:
 &quot;Date&quot;,&quot;Pupil&quot;,&quot;Grade&quot;
 &quot;25 May&quot;,&quot;Bloggs, Fred&quot;,&quot;C&quot;
 &quot;25 May&quot;,&quot;Doe, Jane&quot;,&quot;B&quot;
 &quot;15 July&quot;,&quot;Bloggs, Fred&quot;,&quot;A&quot;
 &quot;15 April&quot;,&quot;Muniz, Alvin &quot;Hank&quot;&quot;,&quot;A&quot;

Note the use of the double quote to enclose each field. This prevents the comma in the actual field value (Bloggs, Fred; Doe, Jane; etc.) from being interpreted as a field separator. This necessitates a way to &quot;escape&quot; the field wrapper itself, in this case the double quote; it is customary to double the double quotes actually contained in a field as with those surrounding &quot;Hank&quot;. In this way, any ASCII text including newlines can be contained in a field.

ASCII and Unicode include several control characters that are intended to be used as delimiters. They are: 28 for File Separator, 29 for Group Separator, 30 for Record Separator, and 31 for Unit Separator. Example of such use is MARC 21 bibliographic data format. Use of these characters has not achieved widespread adoption; some systems have replaced their control properties with more accepted controls such as CR/LF and TAB.

== Uses and applications ==

Due to their widespread use, comma- and tab-delimited text files can be opened by several kinds of applications, including most spreadsheet programs and statistical packages, sometimes even without the user designating which delimiter has been used. Despite that each of those applications has its own database design and its own file format (for example, accdb or xlsx), they can all map the fields in a DSV file to their own data model and format.

Typically a delimited file format is indicated by a specification. Some specifications provide conventions for avoiding delimiter collision, others do not. Delimiter collision is a problem that occurs when a character that is intended as part of the data gets interpreted as a delimiter instead. Comma- and space-separated formats often suffer from this problem, since in many contexts those characters are legitimate parts of a data field. Most such files avoid delimiter collision either by surrounding all data fields in double quotes, or only quoting those data fields that contain the delimiter character. One problem with tab-delimited text files is that tabs are difficult to distinguish from spaces; therefore, there are sometimes problems with the files being corrupted when people try to edit them by hand. Another set of problems occur due to errors in the file structure, usually during import of file into a database (in the example above, such error may be a pupil&#x27;s first name missing).

Depending on the data itself, it may be beneficial to use non-standard characters such as the tilde (~) as delimiters. With rising prevalence of web sites and other applications that store snippets of code in databases, simply using a &quot; which occurs in every hyperlink and image source tag simply is not sufficient to avoid this type of collision. Since colons (:), semi-colons (;), pipes (|), and many other characters are also used, it can be quite challenging to find a character that is not being used elsewhere.

<doc id="1116115" wikidata="Q2586745" url="?curid=1116115" title="General Leibniz rule">
<text>In calculus, the general Leibniz rule, named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, generalizes the product rule for the derivative of the product of two (which is also known as &quot;Leibniz&#x27;s rule&quot;). It states that if formula_1 and formula_2 are -times differentiable functions, then the product formula_3 is also -times differentiable and its -th derivative is given by
formula_4
where formula_5 is the binomial coefficient and formula_6 denotes the &quot;j&quot;th derivative of &quot;f&quot; (and in particular formula_7).

The rule can be proven by using the product rule and mathematical induction.

==Second derivative==
If, for example, , the rule gives an expression for the second derivative of a product of two functions:
formula_8

==More than two factors==
The formula can be generalized to the product of &quot;m&quot; differentiable functions &quot;f&quot;1...,&quot;f&quot;&quot;m&quot;.
formula_9
where the sum extends over all &quot;m&quot;-tuples (&quot;k&quot;1...,&quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot;) of non-negative integers with formula_10 and
formula_11
are the multinomial coefficients. This is akin to the multinomial formula from algebra.

==Proof==

The proof of the general Leibniz rule proceeds by induction. Let formula_1 and formula_2 be formula_14-times differentiable functions. The base case when formula_15 claims that:
formula_16
which is the usual product rule and is known to be true. Next, assume that the statement holds for a fixed formula_17 that is, that
formula_18

Then,
formula_19
And so the statement holds for and the proof is complete.

==Relationship to the binomial theorem==

The Leibniz rule bears a strong resemblance to the binomial theorem, and in fact the binomial theorem can be proven directly from the Leibniz rule by taking formula_20 and formula_21 which gives
:formula_22
and then dividing both sides by formula_23

==Multivariable calculus==
With the multi-index notation for partial derivatives of functions of several variables, the Leibniz rule states more generally:
formula_24

This formula can be used to derive a formula that computes the symbol of the composition of differential operators. In fact, let &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; be differential operators (with coefficients that are differentiable sufficiently many times) and formula_25 Since &quot;R&quot; is also a differential operator, the symbol of &quot;R&quot; is given by:
formula_26

A direct computation now gives:
formula_27

This formula is usually known as the Leibniz formula. It is used to define the composition in the space of symbols, thereby inducing the ring structure.

<text>Titlow Beach is in Tacoma, Washington, USA. It is located along Puget Sound near the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. It has a beach, community center, park, water play area (all of which are run by Metro Parks Tacoma), one restaurant, a view of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, a small boardwalk, and is a popular scuba diving area.

==History==

Local lawyer Aaron R. Titlow purchased the property in 1903 and in 1911 built the 3 1/2 story Swiss Chalet-style Hotel Hesperides, a resort hotel that lasted until 1923. In 1926, the hotel was acquired by the park district. During the 1930s, a renovation by the WPA project removed one and one-half stories of the lodge. The lodge served as the home of the assistant superintendent for parks and then the caretaker for the park until 1990. It was remodeled in 2011, and the pool was replaced in 2013 with a water play area.

From June 3, 1928 until 1950 a ferry service ran between Titlow Beach, Pt Fosdick and Fox Island. Ferry service was interrupted in July 1940 with the completion of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, and resumed November 8, 1940 with the collapse of the bridge.

In 1963, octopus wrestling championships were held at the beach.

<text>Goght’n (; also mentioned in sources as Goght’an, , and alternatively transliterated as ) was a canton () located in the province of Vaspurakan in historical Armenia. Its borders roughly corresponded to the modern Ordubad Rayon of Nakhichevan, Azerbaijan.

Goght’n was well known for winemaking, the quality of its grape and fruit orchards. The region also was the birthplace of a number of prominent Armenian &quot;gusans&quot; (minstrels). The ancestors of the renowned twentieth-century Armenian composer and music ethnologist Komitas Vardapet were originally from Goght’n. Some of the region&#x27;s oldest towns and villages have survived to this day, including Jugha (now Julfa) and Ordvat’ (modern-day Ordubad).

==History==
===Early to medieval===

According to Movses Khorenatsi, King Tigran Ervanduni (of the Orontid line) of Armenia settled his wife and his daughters in an area to the east of (Ararat) and up to Goght’n, in Tambat, Oskiokh, Djaghguyn and other settlements giving them also three towns – Khram, Jugha and Khoshakunik, and on the other bank of the river (Arax) all the fields from Ajanakan up to the Nakhchavan Fortress. Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet, is assumed to have lived and worked in the town of Msrvanis (Mesropavan) during his stay in Goght’n. The Armenian princes of Goght’n probably had branched off from the family in Syunik’ and had their own regional bishop. The second &quot;Gahnamak&quot;, or Military List, notes that the princes were expected during time of war to furnish 500 cavalry to help defend the Kingdom of Armenia&#x27;s southern gate (that is, its southern border).

The seventh-century Armenian atlas &quot;Ashkharhats’uyts’&quot; mentions Goght’n as the 31st of the 35 districts of Vaspurakan. Its last hereditary Armenian prince, Vahan, who had been brought up in Damascus as a Muslim, converted back to his Christian faith after returning to Armenia. For this act of apostasy, he was seized by the Muslims and sent to Syria, where he was tortured and executed in 737. Sometime in the early tenth century, during the tenure of the emir of Iranian Azerbaijan Yusuf ibn Abi&#x27;l-Saj, Goght’n fell to a Muslim emir called, by the contemporary Armenian historian Hovhannes Draskhanakertts&#x27;i, Agarene, probably from the Arab Shaybani tribe. Goght’n may have been referred to at this time as &quot;Kilit&quot; by the Arabs. When the fortress of Yernjak fell to Yusuf in 912/14, Yusuf awarded it to the emir, whose successors sought to expand their landholdings through the course of the tenth century. The city of Nakhchavan was taken, though by the second half of the ninth century the emir of Goght’n had lost it to the Bagratuni kings of Armenia. The emirs of Goght’n and Armenians kings continued to struggle over control of the Arax River Valley until King Gagik I () reduced them at end of the tenth century. It was later overrun by the Seljuks, passing under the control of the Mongols and later Safavid Persia.

===Early modern to modern===
In 1604, the region was depopulated by Shah Abbas I and its Armenian inhabitants deported to Iran. Goght’n became a part of the khanate of Nakhichevan in the mid-1700s and was divided into five districts (&quot;mahals&quot;): Ordubad, Agulis, Dasht, Belev, and Chananab. In 1752, it was attacked and subjugated by Azad Khan.

In the early twentieth century, Goght&#x27;an was the name given to the subregion of Sharur-Nakhichevan by the government of the First Republic of Armenia. Its administrative center was at Agulis, with commissar Ashot Melik-Musian and militia chief Movses Giulnazarian at its head. The region suffered intense fighting during a brief conflict between Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in the latter half of 1919, including the destruction of Agulis in December by a Muslim mob.

==Monuments==
A number of historical Armenian churches were once found in Goght’n. These included Basilica of St. James in Shor’ot’, the Monastery of St. Thomas the Apostle in Upper Agulis, Holy Mother of God Church in Ts’gnay, and Monastery of St. Mesrop in Msrvanis.

<text>Puegnago del Garda (Gardesano: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy.

It is bounded by the comunes of San Felice del Benaco, Manerba del Garda, Muscoline, Polpenazze del Garda and Salò.

==History==

Thanks to the finding of the remains of lake-dwelling villages in the small lakes of &quot;Sovenigo&quot;, it has been possible to ascertain that the area was already inhabited during the prehistoric era. When visiting &quot;Monte Boccale&quot; it is possible to encounter plaques belonging to the Romanesque period, the most spectacular being walled into the door of the parish church in San Michele.

The town experienced Lombard domination, as is demonstrated by documents listing the property of some Lombards; in the 14th century it was subjected to the dominion of Mastino della Scala and in the 15th century to domination from Venice. During the period under the Venetian Republic Puegnago became part of the Valtenesi area. The plague of 1630 did not spare the town, bringing great suffering and mourning.

Puegnago was subjected to the raids of bandits in the 17th century, among whom there was the terrible &quot;Dominisette&quot;, who subjected the population to appalling outrages. With the arrival of the war of Spanish succession, French and Spanish troops plundered Puegnago of the money of the Company of the Sacred Body of Christ and of many sacred works contained in the town. The population was proud of the assistance given to neighbouring towns after the battle of San Martino, when they aided the numerous injured soldiers.

From 1818 to 1825 Puegnago, Soiano and San Felice were gathered together, whereas only in 1928 was Puegnago joined to Raffa. The origin of the unusual name is thought to date back to the Roman era, from the Roman &quot;Popinius&quot; which became &quot;Popiniacus&quot; following a form of Romanisation.

<text>Gugark (, , ) was the 13th province of the ancient kingdom of Armenia. It now comprises parts of northern Armenia, northeast Turkey, and southwest Georgia.

== Etymology ==
Etymologically, Gugark in Armenian language denotes land of Gugars. word &quot;Gugar&quot; being a root and suffix -k meaning &quot;land of&quot;.

==History==
In ancient Urartian inscriptions dating to 785 BC, the territory of Gugark is referred to as Zabaha, which is known today as Javakheti (Javakhk in Armenian). In the beginning of IV century BC, (302BC) the territory was under Caucasian Iberia, but during Artaxias I&#x27;s reign it was conquered. During the reign of the Artaxiad and Arshakuni kings of Armenia, Gugark was ruled by one of the kingdom&#x27;s four &quot;bdeashkhs&quot;. The &quot;bdeashkh&quot; of Gugark was responsible for protecting the state&#x27;s northern border. During the 4th century, the region was ruled by members of a branch of the House of Mihran. In 387, Armenia was partitioned between the Byzantine and Sassanid empires and Gugark, with the exception of the canton of Tashir, was annexed to Caucasian Iberia. The ruler of the region around 425 was Arshusha. In 652, the Armenian prince Theodore Rshtuni was allowed by the Arabs to unite Gugark with his realms. 

In the following centuries, Gugark and its cantons fell under the sway of several rulers. In the 8th century, it became a part of Emirate of Tbilisi. In the middle of the 9th century, it was taken by the Georgian Bagrationis, while the Armenian Bagratunis took over its eastern cantons.

== Inhabitants ==
Armenian catholicos and historian Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi says in his history that the majority of this region was Armenian people with minority of Iberian people. Also an Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi mentions Arshusha V, &quot;bdeashkh&quot; of the Iberians.

<text>Rshtunik () was a canton () of the province of Vaspurakan of historical Armenia, encompassing the area on the southern coast of Lake Van, which was also referred to as (&quot;Sea of Rshtunik&quot;), as well as Aghtamar Island. It was located to the east of the canton of Andzevatsik, to the north of Moxoene, to the west of Hayots Dzor, and to the east of Yerevark of Turuberan province. It was ruled by the Rshtuni (also referred to as Rashduni) noble house until the ninth century.

The name of the region is likely connected with the name of Urartu/Urashtu, the Iron Age kingdom that was centered on the coastal regions around Lake Van.

Rshtunik covered a mountainous region filled with river rapids, fertile lands, and rich mines. It was also home to a royal residence of the king of Armenia called , located directly across from Aghtamar Island. In medieval times, Rshtunik contained numerous churches and monasteries, which functioned as centers of learning and art. One of the most famous of these was Narekavank (since demolished), where St. Gregory of Narek lived and studied.

The region corresponded approximately to the latter-day district of Gevaş in the Van Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Before the Armenian genocide, this district contained more than twenty Armenian-populated villages with a total population of about ten thousand.

<text>Andzevatsik (in , &quot;Anjewacʼikʼ&quot;) was a region of ancient and medieval Armenia c. 400–800 in the South-East of Vaspurakan, ruled by the Antzevatsi family.

Andzevatsik was the eleventh ghavar (region) of the province of Vaspurakan of Great Armenia. There were 3 fortified cities in the region: Alaman, Mihravan and Ahzi. Bordered in the south with the province of Korchayk. In the region there was a significant monastery of Hogyats and Kangavar fortress.

Andzevatsik was one of the nine main principalities of Greater Armenia, which did not allow the Sassanids to advance their borders, and the borders of their vassals (Iveria and Albania), further into the interior of Armenia, after the partition of the Armenian kingdom in 387 between the Sassanid and the Roman Empire.

The Armenian princely family of Andzevatsi owned five ghavaras (regions) of the province (ashkhar) of Vaspurakan south of Lake Van (Tosp). Anzevaci descended from the kings of Hubushkia.
Princely clan of Andzevatsi put forward a number of prominent nakharars (Tachat Andzevatsi were presiding prince of the Emirate of Armenia) and church leaders (Khosrov Andzevatsi). After the gradual ruin and weakening of this princely clan as a result of wars and uprisings, the princely clan of Artsruni took possession of their lands.

<text>Avis Gray (born September 3, 1954) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, and again from 1992 to 1995.

==Biography==
Gray was born in Virden, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. She subsequently worked as a home economist, and was a member of the Manitoba Home Economics Association and the Canadian Home Economics Association.

Gray was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1988 provincial election as a Liberal, defeating incumbent New Democrat Harvey Smith by 624 votes in the central Winnipeg riding of Ellice. The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Gray joined 19 other Liberals in the official opposition. She argued for an increase in welfare rates during this period.

The Liberals fell back to seven seats in the 1990 provincial election, and Gray lost to NDP candidate Conrad Santos by 108 votes. Two years later, she returned to the legislature via a by-election in the south Winnipeg riding of Crescentwood, defeating NDP candidate Tim Sale by 441 votes.

Despite an early lead in the polls, the Manitoba Liberal Party ran a poor campaign in the 1995 provincial election and fell from seven to three seats. Gray placed last in a close three-way race in Crescentwood, finishing behind Sale and PC candidate Debbie Vivian. She has not sought a return to the legislature since this time.

Gray worked as the campaign manager for federal Liberal cabinet minister Reg Alcock when he ran for re-election in Winnipeg South in the 2004 federal election, and was subsequently hired as a lobbyist of the Canadian Wheat Board, a department under Alcock&#x27;s ministry.

<doc id="1116207" wikidata="Q6927892" url="?curid=1116207" title="Mozart's name">
<text>The composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart went by many different names in his lifetime. This resulted partly from the church traditions of the day, and partly from Mozart being multilingual and freely adapting his name to other languages.

==Baptismal record==
Mozart was baptized as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart on 28 January 1756, the day after his birth, at St. Rupert&#x27;s Cathedral in Salzburg. The baptismal register of the cathedral parish contains the entry shown below, written down in Latin by city chaplain Leopold Lamprecht. A transcription with editorial additions by Otto Erich Deutsch follows.

Mozart&#x27;s father Leopold announced the birth of his son in a letter to the publisher Johann Jakob Lotter with the words &quot;... the boy is called Joannes Chrisostomus, Wolfgang, Gottlieb&quot; (&quot;der Bub heißt Joannes Chrisostomus, Wolfgang, Gottlieb&quot; in German). The baptismal names &quot;Joannes&quot; and &quot;Chrysostomus&quot; also have German equivalents, namely &quot;Johann&quot; and &quot;Chrysostomos&quot; (or less frequently, &quot;Chrysostom&quot;). The widely used &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; employs these versions in the heading name for its Mozart article, which parenthesizes the little-used baptismal names: &quot;(Johann Chrysostom) Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.&quot;

Here are the details of the various names given on the register:
*Mozart&#x27;s first two baptismal names, &quot;Joannes Chrysostomus&quot;, represent his saint&#x27;s name, following the custom of the Catholic Church. They result from his birthday, 27 January, being the feast day of St. John Chrysostom. The document also records that Mozart was of legitimate birth and gives the names of his parents and his father Leopold&#x27;s occupation as court musician. The first paragraph indicates that the baptism took place at 10:30 in the morning, and that Mozart had been born at 8:00 the night before. The baptismal name &quot;Joannes Chrysostomus&quot; was in conformance to Catholic custom and was not used by Mozart in everyday life. &quot;Chrysostomus&quot; means &quot;golden mouth.&quot;
*&quot;Wolfgangus&quot; is &quot;Wolfgang&quot;, adapted to the Latin used in the parish register. Mozart used &quot;Wolfgang&quot; in German-speaking contexts. Wolfgang was the name of his maternal grandfather, .
*&quot;Theophilus&quot; comes from Greek and is variously rendered as &quot;lover of God&quot; or &quot;loved by God.&quot; &quot;Gottlieb&quot; is its German form, and the familiar &quot;Amadeus&quot; is its Latin form. In later life, Mozart himself would use the Italian and French equivalents, respectively &quot;Amadeo&quot; and &quot;Amédée&quot;. &quot;Theophilus&quot; was a name of Mozart&#x27;s godfather, the merchant Joannes Theophilus Pergmayr, whose presence is recorded in the fourth paragraph.

==Later life==

Austrian musicologist Otto Erich Deutsch, who studied all available letters and documents about Mozart, arrived at the following conclusion about what he had called himself: &quot;In Italy, from 1770, Mozart called himself &#x27;Wolfgango Amadeo&#x27;, and from about 1777, &#x27;Wolfgang Amadé&#x27;.&quot;

The use of multiple language versions of the same name was common in Mozart&#x27;s day. Joseph Haydn went by &quot;Joseph&quot; (German, English and French), &quot;Josephus&quot; (Latin) and &quot;Giuseppe&quot; (Italian); and Ludwig van Beethoven published his works as &quot;Luigi&quot; (Italian) and as &quot;Louis&quot; (French).

Mozart&#x27;s preference for &quot;Wolfgang Amadè&quot; can be seen on the wedding contract for his marriage to Constanze Weber, dated August 3, 1782, where his signature says &quot;Wolfgang Amadè Mozart&quot;. In the St. Stephen&#x27;s parish register entry for the marriage, dated August 4, Mozart is referred to as &quot;Herr Wolfgang Adam Mozart&quot;, which is a different name but probably a misspelling for &quot;Amadé&quot; (or Amadeus).

Mozart spelled &quot;Amadè&quot; variously in regard to the accent on the final letter. Robert Spaethling, who translated many of Mozart&#x27;s letters, writes, he &quot;is especially nonchalant in his placement of Italian and French accents: sometime he writes &#x27;chèr papa&#x27;, at other times &#x27;chér papa,&#x27; and even his own name appears variously as &#x27;Amadé&#x27;, &#x27;Amadè&#x27;, and plain &#x27;Amade&#x27;.&quot;

Mozart&#x27;s preference for &quot;Amadè&quot; was not in general respected by others. Frequently, he was called either &quot;Wolfgang Amadeus&quot; or &quot;Wolfgang Gottlieb&quot;. Here are examples:
*The day Mozart died, his name was entered in the death records of the Vienna Magistrate as &quot;Wolfgang Amadeus&quot;. This is the earliest posthumous source that uses the Latin version of his name. In this time it was common practice to use a latinized form for all death records.
*In a letter dated December 11, 1791, Mozart&#x27;s widow Constanze, in severe financial straits, asked to be given a pension by the Emperor (the appeal was ultimately successful). She signed herself &quot;Konstantia Mozart, née Weber, widow relict of the late Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.&quot; Imperial officials, replying to her request, used the same name.
*A benefit concert for Mozart&#x27;s family was held in Prague on December 28, 1791, billed as &quot;Concert in memory of Wolfgang Gottlieb Mozart&quot;.

==The rise of &quot;Amadeus&quot;==

It is possible that the now-standard &quot;Amadeus&quot; originated as a facetious name. He signed some letters in mock Latin as &quot;Wolfgangus Amadeus Mozartus&quot;; this was certainly no accident as in one letter he did the same to the date of the letter as well: adding &quot;-us&quot; to the end of each word. But he never signed any letter as &quot;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&quot; himself.

Mozart&#x27;s only mention as &quot;Wolfgang Amadeus&quot; in an official document made during his lifetime was found in 1998 by Mozart scholar Michael Lorenz in the registers of the Lower Austrian Governorship, where in May 1787 &quot;Mozart Wolfgang Amadeus&quot; is referred to as having applied for the return of his written surety for his friend . Other uses of &quot;Amadeus&quot;, from immediately after Mozart&#x27;s death in 1791, are given above.

The 19th century saw the gradual victory of &quot;Amadeus&quot; over alternative middle names. The earliest (18th century) biographers of Mozart, such as Friedrich Schlichtegroll and Franz Niemetschek, used &quot;Gottlieb&quot;. However, in 1798 the publishing firm of Breitkopf &amp; Härtel began to issue a (partial) Complete Works edition under the name &quot;Amadeus&quot;. The dominance of &quot;Amadeus&quot; began around about 1810; Romanticism, notably in the person of E. T. A. Hoffmann, &quot;seized upon this name to proclaim its veneration for Mozart&quot;. Although various scholars since that time have made use of &quot;Amadè&quot; or &quot;Gottlieb&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot; remains by far the most familiar term for the general public.
The signature on the autograph scores is commonly &quot;(di) Wolfgango Amadeo Mozart&quot;, although sometimes &quot;Amadeo Wolfgango Mozart&quot; is seen, for example on Symphony No. 1 and the Haffner Symphony. The violin concertos also show this variation, with the autographs of numbers 1 (K. 207) and 3 (K. 216) autographs in Krakow showing &quot;Amadeo Wolfgango&quot; and the remaining, including Violin Concerto No. 5 (K. 219) held at the U.S. Library of Congress, showing the more common Wolfgango Amadeo.

==Facetious names==
In the frequently playful letters of his youth Mozart would sometimes spell his name backwards, viz., &quot;Mozart Wolfgang&quot; or &quot;Trazom&quot;. See above for the possible origin of &quot;Amadeus&quot; as facetious.

<text>Stubbington is a village which is located between Southampton and Portsmouth, in the county of Hampshire on the south coast of England. It is within the borough of Fareham.

==History==

Both Stubbington and neighbouring Crofton were mentioned in the Domesday Book (the 11th-century UK census) as small districts belonging to the estates of Titchfield Abbey.

The earliest known cricket match to have been played in Hampshire took place in the village in 1733.

During the 19th century, Stubbington engulfed Crofton and the small fishing village of Hill Head. The Crofton name still remains in the name of many local facilities, such as the Crofton School and Crofton Old Church.

At the start of the 20th century, the village still consisted of just a few dozen cottages and farms. By 1939, the population had risen to around 2,500, and a number of small shops had opened surrounding the village green. This remains the focus of the village to the present day, with a war memorial situated on the central village green.

==The Church==

The &#x27;Crofton Old Church&#x27; at Crofton is one of the oldest known inhabited sites in the area. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086, and it is thought to date back to the reign of King Alfred the Great in the 9th century. It is believed to have caught the eye of Samuel Pepys in 1662, and was extensively renovated during the 13th century. A new church (Holy Rood) was built in Stubbington which took over the function of Crofton Church in 1878.

==The War Memorial and Village Pump==

In 1922 a wooden War Memorial was built to commemorate those from Stubbington and Hill Head who fell in the First World War. Their names were carved into the roof of the memorial although over the years they have been worn away. The Memorial takes the form of a shelter over the village pump, and today it is one of few pre-war structures standing in the vicinity of Stubbington Village Centre. The names carved into the roof of the memorial have now been cleaned and can be seen clearly.

==Present day==
The population of Stubbington has risen to over 25,000, with new housing estates taking over a number of the surrounding fields. The town has a number of modern shops as well as a range of other facilities, including a doctor, dentist, library, community centre and seven schools. The former Royal Navy site of HMS &quot;Daedalus&quot; lies between Stubbington and neighbouring Lee-on-the-Solent, and a small part is currently being developed, however more is scheduled for further development that could further expand the town.

=== Neighbouring areas===
The nearest village is Titchfield. Also near Stubbington is the area of Fareham called Hill Head and the town of Lee-on-the-Solent.

<text>Rshtuni (, also spelled Rashduni, Rshdouni, Reshdouni, Rashdouni, Rachdouni, Rachdoni, Rshduni, and Rushdoony) was an old Armenian noble house which ruled the region of Rshtuniq who were purportedly descendants of Rusas I of Urartu. 

The first attested member of the house is Manadjihr Rshtuni from about 330, brother of Zora, attested in 335 and 350 both of whom revolted against the King of Armenia Tiran, along with the prince Vatche Artsruni. The king ordered the extermination of the two families, but Savasp Artsruni and Tadjat Rshtuni survived. The latter is the father of Garegin Rshtuni, attested between 370–80.

Artak Rshtuni is attested in 445. The family rules from their region of Rshtuniq, as well as Bznuniq obtained from Arshakunis after the extermination of the family Bznuni. Rshtunis support the Sassanid Persians for the most part against the Byzantines.

The best-known member and the leading figure of the family in the early 7th century is Theodoros Rshtuni, marzban then prince of Armenia from 638 to 655, who had the difficult task of ensuring Armenia&#x27;s survival between Byzantine and Arab ambitions. Following the destruction of the Sassanid empire, the Muslim incursions into Armenia in 642 began. He is eventually exiled by the Caliph to Damascus.

The family becomes increasingly irrelevant following Theodoros&#x27; exile, becoming vassals of the Artsrunis and losing their hereditary land of Bznunik to the Mamikonians in 656. Vart Rshtuni is the last attested member of the family in 705.

<text>Arrin Hawkins is an American activist and political candidate. Hawkins ran as the vice presidential nominee of the Socialist Workers Party in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, while Róger Calero ran for president.

Because she could not reach 35 years of age in time for inauguration, she was constitutionally ineligible to serve as vice president. Therefore, some states did not allow Hawkins&#x27;s name to be listed on the ballot. In those states, Margaret Trowe, the Socialist Workers&#x27; vice-presidential candidate from the 2000 ticket, stood in for her on the ballot.
Calero also required an alternate in some states, because he was born in Nicaragua; the original candidate Martin Koppel would also have been ineligible. The ticket with Calero at the head won 5,150 votes and that with James Harris won 2,424.

As the running mate of Martin Koppel, she was the SWP candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 2002. She ran for Manhattan Borough president in 2005, winning 2,375 votes (1%), losing by a wide margin to Scott Stringer.

Hawkins is a leader in the youth wing of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. She holds a degree from the University of Minnesota, where she spent time in Senegal studying the role of women in African society.

<doc id="1116216" wikidata="Q587670" url="?curid=1116216" title="Delta ray">
<text>A delta ray is a secondary electron with enough energy to escape a significant distance away from the primary radiation beam and produce further ionization. The term is sometimes used to describe any recoil particle caused by secondary ionization. The term was coined by J. J. Thomson.

==Characteristics==
A delta ray is characterized by very fast electrons produced in quantity by alpha particles or other fast energetic charged particles knocking orbiting electrons out of atoms. Collectively, these electrons are defined as delta radiation when they have sufficient energy to ionize further atoms through subsequent interactions on their own. Delta rays appear as branches in the main track of a cloud chamber (See Figs. 1,2). These branches will appear nearer the start of the track of a heavy charged particle, where more energy is imparted to the ionized electrons.

==Delta rays in particle accelerators==

Otherwise called a knock-on electron, the term &quot;delta ray&quot; is also used in high energy physics to describe single electrons in particle accelerators that are exhibiting characteristic deceleration. In a bubble chamber, electrons will lose their energy more quickly than other particles through Bremsstrahlung and will create a spiral track due to their small mass and the magnetic field. The Bremsstrahlung rate is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the electron.

==Epsilon ray==
An Epsilon ray or Epsilon radiation is a type of tertiary radiation. Epsilon rays are a form of particle radiation and are composed of electrons. The term was coined by J. J. Thomson, but is very rarely used as of 2019.

<doc id="1116217" wikidata="Q2360881" url="?curid=1116217" title="Moxoene">
<text>Moxoene or Mokk&#x27; () was a territory of Kingdom of Armenia and later Sasanian Armenia, located east of Arzanene from south of Lake Van to north of Bohtan river. The territory was ruled by a local dynasty.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Moxoene&quot; only appears in ancient sources in the early fourth century. In later centuries, Armenian sources used the name &quot;Mokkʿ.&quot; The ancient name is preserved in modern times with the local Kurds using the name &quot;Miks&quot; for the main town of the area. Attempts have been made to find the pre-Armenian attestations of Moxoene and some ethnonyms have been suggested including &quot;Μύκοι&quot; by Herodotus, &quot;Muški&quot; from Assyrian sources and &quot;τῶν Μοσχικῶν ὄρη&quot; or &quot;Μοξιανοί&quot; by Ptolemy as attested by him in &quot;Geography&quot;. However, none of these fit the geographical and linguistic criteria.

== History ==

In 198, Moxoene was emerged into Corduene.

During the Battle of Samarra in 363, Roman soldiers likely marched through Moxoene under generals Procopius and Sebastianus to join Arshak II. During the territorial negotiations that same year, the Sasanian Empire demanded the area of Moxoene. After the war, Moxoene emerged as a new political entity part of the Sasanian Empire. The diocese of Moxoene belonged to Nestorianism.

The settlement was known in Roman times as Moxos, after the 8th century as Mokks or Moks, and after the 18th century as Mukus. Moxoene may have been named after the Bronze Age Mushki people, who according to Assyrian sources, settled in the region.

<doc id="1116220" wikidata="Q6704603" url="?curid=1116220" title="Luoma Lake">
<text>Luoma Lake () is located in central Jiangsu province, China, northwest of Suqian. In an average year, the lake, connecting with the Grand Canal, takes up an area of 375 square kilometers. In Jiangsu, it is perceived as one of the four major freshwater lakes. Besides its historical values, it is currently known as a travel destination; it is listed as one of the main attractions for tourists visiting the city of Suqian.

== Origin ==
Currently, most people in the city believe that Luoma Lake gets its name from its shape, which looks like the backbone of a horse. They insist that this lake is formed by nature. Indeed, Luoma Lake was initially formed as a tectonic lake and enlarged by the change of river system. Due to the change in the course of the Yellow River which temporarily merged with the Si River and Huai River between the Song and Qing dynasties, the Yellow River flooded this area for several times and enlarged the surface area of Luoma Lake. During the past 300 years, the Yellow River brought sediments into Luoma Lake and created depositions inside the lake. In the 1950s, dams were constructed around the lake and made the lake a larger semi-artificial reservoir.

== History ==
The history of Luoma Lake can be traced back to the period of Gaozong of Song. According to his autobiography, he came to this place and named it as Luoma, which literally means horse backbone. Because &quot;Luoma&quot; shares the same pronunciation with the phrase &quot;being removed from office due to corruption&quot; in Mandarin Chinese, the county government of Xinyi renamed it &quot;Longma Lake&quot;, which has been boycotted by local people.

== Ecosystem ==
Due to its temperature and humidity appropriate for living, several species inhabit in Luoma Lake. Those species include phragmites, nelumbo nucifera, silver carp, Chinese white shrimp, and crab.

=== Cyanobacteria Community ===
A study was conducted in Luoma Lake in 2015 to investigate the factors that influence the cyanobacteria abundance. It suggests that this abundance has a positive relationship with the concentration of ammonium and a negative one with oxygen concentration.

<doc id="1116223" wikidata="Q3844447" url="?curid=1116223" title="Nam Phương">
<text>Empress Nam Phương (14 November 1913 – 16 September 1963), born Marie-Thérèse Nguyễn Hữu Thị Lan, was the last empress consort of Vietnam. She was the wife of Bảo Đại (), the last emperor of Vietnam (officially named as Đại Nam before March 1945), from 1934 until her death. She was also the second and last empress consort (&quot;hoàng hậu&quot;) of the Nguyễn dynasty.

==Background==
Marie-Thérèse Nguyễn Hữu Thị Lan was born in Gò Công, Biên Hòa province, which is sometimes misunderstood as what is now Gò Công city. Her birth date, according to both the book &quot;Souverains et notabilites d&#x27;Indochine&quot; compiled by the Government-General of French Indochina and the book &quot;Nguyễn Phúc tộc thế phả&quot; compiled by the Board of Trustees of the House of Nguyễn Phúc (_), is 4 November 1914. On her tomb in France and in the records of Saigon City Governor&#x27;s Office, her date of birth is written as 14 November 1913.

Her father, Pierre Nguyễn Hữu Hào, described as a wealthy merchant, had been born into a poor ethnic Vietnamese Catholic family in Kiến Hòa district, Định Tường province. Through an introduction from the Bishop of Saigon, he became secretary to the billionaire Lê Phát Đạt, Duke of Long-My, and eventually married his employer&#x27;s daughter, Marie Lê Thị Bình, and inherited his title.

A naturalized French citizen, Nguyễn Hữu Thị Lan, who was known as Mariette, studied at the Couvent des Oiseaux, an aristocratic Catholic school located in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, where she was sent at the age of 12.

She was a distant cousin of her future husband, the emperor.

==Marriage==
On 9 March 1934, the public announcement of the engagement of Nguyễn Hữu Thị Lan and Bảo Đại, Emperor of Đại Nam, was released. In it, Bảo Đại stated, &quot;The future Queen, reared like us in France, combines in her person the graces of the West and the charms of the East. We who have had the occasion to meet her believe that she is worthy to be our companion and our equal. We are certain by her conduct and example that she fully merits the title of First Woman of the Empire.&quot;
After a formal betrothal ceremony in the imperial summer palace in Da Lat, the emperor married Nguyễn Hữu Thị Lan on 20 March 1934, in Huế. The ceremony was Buddhist, though the ruler&#x27;s Catholic fiancée caused some controversy; the country&#x27;s population was not entirely in favor of the bride&#x27;s religious affiliation. Others suspected that the marriage &quot;smelled high of French chicanery.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;discontent was general&quot; in the country, given that Nguyễn Hữu Thị Lan had declined to renounce Catholicism and was appealing to Pope Pius XI for a dispensation. Another article noted that there was much discussion over a report that the pope might allow the bride to &quot;remain a Catholic if she gave the Church her girl children.&quot; Further complicating the wedding plans was the apparent disapproval of the young monarch&#x27;s mother, Doan Huy, and his late father&#x27;s secondary wives, all of whom had other bridal candidates that Bảo Đại apparently did not consider.

At the state ceremony that marked the end of the four-day wedding festivities, Nguyễn Hữu Thị Lan was given the title &#x27;Empress Consort&#x27; and the name Nam Phương, which can be roughly translated as &#x27;Fragrance of the South&#x27;, in acknowledgment of her place of birth.

&quot;Time&quot; on 2 April 1934 closely followed the traditional royal nuptials:

&quot;Little Mariette Nguyen Huu Hao was beautifully married. It took four days. On her way up Annam&#x27;s great mandarin road along the coast she stopped off to climb a mountain and drink of the &quot;frozen spring.&quot; Outside Huê, a cavalcade of palace mandarins on short native Phu-Yen horses met her in the Valley of Clouds and escorted her through the three walls of the Red City into the Palace of Passengers. Next day, dressed in a great brocaded Annamite gown, she stepped into an automobile and was driven to the Emperor&#x27;s Palace, followed by the Imperial princesses and the blue-turbaned wives of the mandarins. Two scrolls, on which were written a prayer to Bảo Đại&#x27;s ancestors and the name and age (18) of Nguyen Huu Hao, were burnt on the altars. Finally the two young people were brought face to face and married. It took three more days of Buddhist rites behind the locked gates of the Red City to complete the ceremony. On the fourth day a battalion of mandarins led in musicians and the bearers of the royal insignia. The new Queen, her hair elaborately wound about a tiara encrusted with precious stones, received the Imperial seal and the golden book. Finally she arose and bowed her forehead to the floor three times, in the traditional Chinese kowtow (pronounced ker-toe) of thanks.&quot;

At the time of her marriage, a song was written in her honor: &quot;In the firmament of the Son of Heaven a brilliant new star has risen!/Supple as the neck of the swan is the charm of her graceful form./Her black and sparkling eyes, in hours of ease, envelop and thrill that happy mortal allowed to see./O, Nguyễn Hữu-Hào! Beautiful are all thy ways.&quot;

=== Empress ===

She was titled as the Empress Consort soon after her marriage to Emperor Bảo Đại in 1934. Bảo Đại bestowed upon her the title of &quot;Nam Phương Hoàng hậu&quot; which went against the convention established by Gia Long. From Gia Long until Khải Định all empresses consort were known as &quot;Hoàng phi&quot; and would only be known as a &quot;Hoàng hậu&quot; after their deaths. 

On 18 June 1945, Nam Phương was raised in rank from &quot;Her Majesty&quot; to &quot;Her Imperial Majesty&quot;. Bảo Đại continued to assume the title of emperor after proclaiming the country&#x27;s independence from France on March 11, 1945, as he was urged to rule his empire as a member of Japan&#x27;s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At this time, Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina, which came under the control of Imperial Japan after the coup d&#x27;état in French Indochina, were reunited to become the Empire of Vietnam. However, the emperor was later convinced to abdicate the throne by the revolutionary movement Viet Minh, at that time not widely known as being led by communists. He accepted Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s invitation to become a supreme advisor to the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam later in 1945.

==Children==
The emperor and empress had five children, most of whom were educated at the French boarding school their mother had attended, .

* Crown Prince Bảo Long (4 January 1936 – 28 July 2007).
* Princess Phương Mai (1 August 1937 – 16 January 2021; married Don Pietro Badoglio, 2nd Duke of Addis Abeba and Marquis of Sabotino).
* Princess Phương Liên born on 2 November 1938 (married Bernard Maurice Soulain).
* Princess Phương Dung born on 5 February 1942.
* Prince Bảo Thăng (30 September 1944 – 15 March 2017).

Nam Phương&#x27;s first official visit to Europe, in the summer of 1939, launched a craze for what one reporter described as &quot;trousers and embroidered tunics for evenings; pagoda silhouettes, [and] revers or sleeve forms.&quot; To the surprise of fashion observers, when she met with Pope Pius XII during that trip, &quot;the visitor from Indochina did not wear the traditional black, long-sleeved gown and veil. Instead, she appeared in a gold, dragon-embroidered tunic, red scarf, and gold hat. She wore silver trousers.&quot;

==Later life==
Nam Phương served as a member of the Reconstruction Committee for Vietnam after the end of World War II and was the patron of the Vietnamese Red Cross. She raised funds and called for the recognition of the independence of Vietnam. After Bảo Đại left Huế for Hanoi in September 1945, he had other mistresses. The next year, the former emperor fled into exile in China. He returned to Vietnam in 1949 at the invitation of the nationalist government and was named Chief of the State of Vietnam, but he went into exile again in 1954.

In 1947, after the communist takeover of the country, the empress and her children moved to Château Thorenc, outside of Cannes, France, which had been in the family since its purchase by her maternal grandfather in the early 20th century. She separated from her husband in 1955. Two years later, when the Vietnamese government announced its confiscation of the imperial family&#x27;s personal property, the bill specifically excluded any real estate owned by the empress prior to 1949. These properties included her father&#x27;s villa at Da Lat, which is now Lam Dong Museum.

==Death==
Empress Nam Phương died on 16 September 1963 from a heart attack, at &quot;Domaine de La Perche&quot;, her home near the small rural village of Chabrignac, Corrèze, France. She was buried in the local cemetery.

== Pictures==
==Media==
Nam Phương was portrayed by the actress Yến Chi in the 2004 Vietnamese miniseries &quot;Ngọn nến Hoàng cung&quot; (&quot;The Imperial Palace&#x27;s Candlelight&quot;). The empress was also portrayed by the singer Hòa Minzy in her 2020 MV &quot;Không thể cùng nhau suốt kiếp&quot;.

<text>Junior officer, company officer or company grade officer refers to the lowest operational commissioned officer category of ranks in a military or paramilitary organization, ranking above non-commissioned officers and below senior officers.

==Duties==
Junior officers are responsible for commanding small groups of enlisted personnel. Depending on their branch and specialty, junior officers may operate and maintain complex systems, such as weapons, vehicles, communication systems, or aircraft. They manage teams, oversee daily operations, and ensure the welfare and discipline of their subordinates. Junior officers are often tasked with planning, coordinating, and supervising tasks or missions. This might involve logistics, tactical oversight, or administrative tasks. Since Junior officers are in the early stages of their careers they are expected to develop leadership, strategic thinking, and operational expertise through experience and formal training.
==Countries==
=== United States===
The terms company officer or company-grade officer are used more in the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps as the ranks of captain, lieutenant grades and other subaltern ranks originated from the officers in command of a company or equivalent (Cavalry troop and artillery battery). In many armed forces, a junior officer is specifically a commissioned officer holding rank equivalent to a naval lieutenant, an army captain or a flight lieutenant or below. In the United States Armed Forces, the term junior officer is used by the Navy, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and NOAA Corps for officers in the ranks of chief warrant officer (W-2 to W-4), ensign (O-1), lieutenant (junior grade) (O-2), and lieutenant (O-3).

<doc id="1116229" wikidata="Q137651" url="?curid=1116229" title="Genesis creation narrative">
<text>The Genesis creation narrative is the creation myth of both Judaism and Christianity, told in the book of Genesis chapters 1 and 2. While the Jewish and Christian tradition is that the account is one comprehensive story, modern scholars of biblical criticism identify the account as a composite work made up of two different stories drawn from different sources. 

The first account, in Genesis 1:1–2:3, is from what scholars call the Priestly source (P), largely dated to the 6th century BCE. In this story, Elohim (the Hebrew generic word for &quot;god&quot;) creates the heavens and the Earth in six days, and then rests on, blesses, and sanctifies the seventh (i.e., the Biblical Sabbath). The second account, which takes up the rest of Genesis 2, is largely from the Jahwist source (J), commonly dated to the 10th or 9th centuries BCE. In this story, God (now referred to by the personal name Yahweh) creates Adam, the first man, from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden. There, he is given dominion over the animals. Eve, the first woman, is created from Adam&#x27;s rib as his companion.

The first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch is thought to have been composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the J source) and was later expanded by other authors (the P source) into a work much alike to Genesis as known today. The authors of the text were influenced by Mesopotamian mythology and ancient near eastern cosmology, and borrowed several themes from them, adapting and integrating them with their unique belief in one God. The combined narrative is a critique of the Mesopotamian theology of creation: Genesis affirms monotheism and denies polytheism.

==Composition==
===Genre===
Scholarly writings frequently refer to Genesis as myth, a genre of folklore consisting primarily of narratives that play a fundamental role in a society. For scholars, this is in contrast to more vernacular usage of the term &quot;myth,&quot; which refers to a belief that is not true. Instead, the veracity of a myth is not a defining criterion.

===Authorship and dating===
Although Orthodox Jews and fundamentalist Christians attribute the authorship of book of Genesis to Moses &quot;as a matter of faith,&quot; the hypothesis of Mosaic authorship has been questioned since the 11th century and rejected in scholarship since the 17th century. Scholars of biblical criticism conclude that it, together with the following four books (making up what Jews call the Torah and biblical scholars call the Pentateuch), is &quot;a composite work, the product of many hands and periods.&quot; 

The creation narrative consists of two separate accounts drawn from different sources. The first account, in Genesis 1:1–2:3, is from what scholars call the Priestly source (P), largely dated to the 6th century BCE. The second account, which is older and takes up the rest of Genesis 2, is largely from the Jahwist source (J), commonly dated to the 10th or 9th centuries BCE. 

The two stories were combined, but there is currently no scholarly consensus on when the narrative reached its final form. A common hypothesis among biblical scholars today is that the first major comprehensive narrative of the Pentateuch was composed in the 7th or 6th centuries BCE. A sizeable minority of scholars believe that the first eleven chapters of Genesis, also known as the primeval history, can be dated to the 3rd century BCE based on discontinuities between the contents of the work and other parts of the Hebrew Bible.

The &quot;Persian imperial authorisation,&quot; which has gained considerable interest and controversy, proposes that the Persians, after their conquest of Babylon in 538 BCE, agreed to grant Jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire, but required the local authorities to produce a single legal code accepted by the entire community. According to this theory, there were two powerful groups in the community: the priestly families who controlled the Temple and the landowning families who made up the &quot;elders,&quot; which were in conflict over many issues. Each had its own &quot;history of origins,&quot; but the Persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text.

===Two stories===
The creation narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the two first chapters of the book of Genesis (there are no chapter divisions in the original Hebrew text; see chapters and verses of the Bible). 

In the first story, the Creator deity is referred to as &quot;Elohim&quot; (the Hebrew generic word for &quot;god&quot;), whereas in the second story, he is referred to with a composite divine name; &quot;L God&quot;. Traditional Jewish and evangelical scholars such as Collins explain this as a single author&#x27;s variation in style in order to, for example, emphasize the unity and transcendence of &quot;God&quot;, who created the heavens and Earth by himself, in the first narrative. Critical scholars such as Richard Elliot Friedman, on the contrary, take this as evidence of multiple authorship. Friedman states that the J source originally only used the &quot;L&quot; (Yahweh) title, but a later editor added &quot;God&quot; to form the composite name: &quot;It therefore appears to be an effort by the Redactor (R) to soften the transition from the P creation, which uses only &#x27;God&#x27; (thirty-five times), to the coming J stories, which use only the name YHWH.&quot;

The first account employs a repetitious structure of divine fiat and fulfillment, then the statement &quot;And there was evening and there was morning, the [&quot;n&quot;th] day,&quot; for each of the six days of creation. In each of the first three days, there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the &quot;waters above&quot; from the &quot;waters below,&quot; and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days, these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with the Sun, Moon, and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally, land-based creatures and humanity populate the land. 

In the second story, Yahweh creates Adam, the first man, from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden. There, he is given dominion over the animals. Eve, the first woman, is created from Adam&#x27;s rib as his companion.

A literary bridge joins the primary accounts in each chapter in Genesis 2:4, reading, &quot;These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created.&quot; This echoes the first line of Genesis 1, &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&quot;, and is reversed in the next phrase, &quot;...in the day that the God made the earth and the heavens&quot;. This verse is one of ten &quot;generations&quot; ( &quot;&quot;) phrases used throughout Genesis, which provide a literary structure to the book. They normally function as headings to what comes after, but the position of this, the first of the series, has been the subject of much debate.

The overlapping stories of Genesis 1 and 2 are usually regarded as contradictory but also complementary, with the first (the P story) concerned with the creation of the entire cosmos while the second (the J story) focuses on man as moral agent and cultivator of his environment.

===Mesopotamian influence===

Comparative mythology provides historical and cross-cultural perspectives for Jewish mythology. Both sources behind the Genesis creation narrative were influenced by Mesopotamian mythology, borrowing several themes from them but adapting them to Israelite religion and establishing a monotheistic creation in opposition to the polytheistic creation myth of ancient Israel&#x27;s neighbors. 

Genesis 1 bears striking similarities and differences with &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;, the Babylonian creation myth. The myth begins with two primeval entities: Apsu, the male freshwater deity, and Tiamat, the female saltwater deity. The first gods were born from their sexual union. The younger gods killed both Apsu and Tiamat. Marduk, the leader of the gods, builds the world with Tiamat&#x27;s body, which he splits in two. With one half, he creates a dome-shaped firmament in the sky to hold back Tiamat&#x27;s upper waters. With the other half, Marduk forms dry land to hold back her lower waters. Marduk then organises the heavenly bodies and assigns tasks to the gods in maintaining the cosmos. When the gods complain about their work, Marduk creates humans out of the blood of the god Kingu. The grateful gods build a temple for Marduk in Babylon. This is similar to the Baal Cycle, in which the Canaanite god Baal builds himself a cosmic temple over seven days.

In both Genesis 1 and &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;, creation consists of bringing order out of chaos. Before creation, there was nothing but a cosmic ocean. During creation, a dome-shaped firmament is put in place to hold back the water and make Earth habitable. Both conclude with the creation of a human called &quot;man&quot; and the building of a temple for the god (in Genesis 1, this temple is the entire cosmos). In contrast to &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;, Genesis 1 is monotheistic. There is no theogony (account of God&#x27;s origins), and there is no trace of the resistance to the reduction of chaos to order (Greek: theomachy, lit. &quot;God-fighting&quot;), all of which mark the Mesopotamian creation accounts. The gods in &quot;Enuma Elish&quot; are amoral, they have limited powers, and they create humans to be their slaves. In Genesis 1, however, God is all-powerful. He creates humans in the divine image and cares for their wellbeing, and gives them dominion over every living thing.

&quot;Enuma Elish&quot; has also left traces on Genesis 2. Both begin with a series of statements of what did not exist at the moment when creation began; &quot;Enuma Elish&quot; has a spring (in the sea) as the point where creation begins, paralleling the spring (on the land; Genesis 2 is notable for being a &quot;dry&quot; creation story) in that &quot;watered the whole face of the ground&quot;; in both myths, Yahweh/the gods first create a man to serve him/them, then animals and vegetation. At the same time, and as with Genesis 1, the Jewish version has drastically changed its Babylonian model: Eve, for example, seems to fill the role of a mother goddess when, in , she says that she has &quot;created a man with Yahweh&quot;, but she is not a divine being like her Babylonian counterpart.

Genesis 2 has close parallels with a second Mesopotamian myth, the Atra-Hasis epic—parallels that, in fact, extend throughout , from the Creation to the Flood and its aftermath. The two share numerous plot details (e.g., the divine garden and the role of the first man in the garden, the creation of the man from a mixture of earth and divine substance, the chance of immortality, etc.), and have a similar overall theme: the gradual clarification of man&#x27;s relationship with God(s) and animals.

===Cosmology===
Genesis 1–2 reflects ancient ideas about science: in the words of E.A. Speiser, &quot;on the subject of creation biblical tradition aligned itself with the traditional tenets of Babylonian science.&quot; The opening words of Genesis 1, &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&quot;, sum up the belief of the author(s) that Yahweh, the god of Israel, was solely responsible for the creation and had no rivals. Later Jewish thinkers, adopting ideas from Greek philosophy, concluded that God&#x27;s Wisdom, Word and Spirit penetrated all things and gave them unity. Christianity, in turn, adopted these ideas and identified Jesus with the creative word: &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&quot; (John 1:1). When the Jews came into contact with Greek thought, there followed a major reinterpretation of the underlying cosmology of the Genesis narrative. The biblical authors conceived the cosmos as a flat disc-shaped Earth in the centre, an underworld for the dead below, and heaven above. Below the Earth were the &quot;waters of chaos&quot;, the cosmic sea, home to mythic monsters defeated and slain by God; in Exodus 20:4, God warns against making an image &quot;of anything that is in the waters under the earth&quot;. There were also waters above the Earth, and so the &quot;raqia&quot; (firmament), a solid bowl, was necessary to keep them from flooding the world. During the Hellenistic period, this was largely replaced by a more &quot;scientific&quot; model as imagined by Greek philosophers, according to which the Earth was a sphere at the centre of concentric shells of celestial spheres containing the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets.

The idea that God created the world out of nothing (&quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot;) has become central today to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism – indeed, the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared – yet it is not found directly in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible. According to Walton, the Priestly authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function. John Day, however, considers that Genesis 1 clearly provides an account of the creation of the material universe. Even so, the doctrine had not yet been fully developed in the early 2nd century AD, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God; by the beginning of the 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.

===Alternative biblical creation accounts===
The Genesis narratives are not the only biblical creation accounts. The Bible preserves two contrasting models of creation. The first is the &quot;logos&quot; (speech) model, where a supreme God &quot;speaks&quot; dormant matter into existence. Genesis 1 is an example of creation by speech. 

The second is the &quot;agon&quot; (struggle or combat) model, in which it is God&#x27;s victory in battle over the monsters of the sea that marks his sovereignty and might. There is no complete combat myth preserved in the Bible. However, there are fragmentary allusions to such a myth in Isaiah 27:1, Isaiah 51:9–10, Job 26:12–13. These passages describe how God defeated the forces of chaos. These forces are personified as sea monsters. These monsters are variously named Yam (Sea), Nahar (River), Leviathan (Coiled One), Rahab (Arrogant One), and Tannin (Dragon). 

Psalm 74 and Isaiah 51 recall a Canaanite myth in which God creates the world by vanquishing the water deities: &quot;Awake, awake! ... It was you that hacked Rahab in pieces, that pierced the Dragon! It was you that dried up the Sea, the waters of the great Deep, that made the abysses of the Sea a road that the redeemed might walk...&quot;

==First narrative: Genesis 1:1–2:3==
===Background===
The first creation account is divided into seven days during which God creates light (day 1); the sky (day 2); the earth, seas, and vegetation (day 3); the sun and moon (day 4); animals of the air and sea (day 5); and land animals and humans (day 6). God rested from his work on the seventh day of creation, the Sabbath.

The use of numbers in ancient texts was often numerological rather than factual – that is, the numbers were used because they held some symbolic value to the author. The number seven, denoting divine completion, permeates Genesis 1: verse 1:1 consists of seven words, verse 1:2 has fourteen, and 2:1–3 has 35 words (5×7); Elohim is mentioned 35 times, &quot;heaven/firmament&quot; and &quot;earth&quot; 21 times each, and the phrases &quot;and it was so&quot; and &quot;God saw that it was good&quot; occur 7 times each.

The cosmos created in Genesis 1 bears a striking resemblance to the Tabernacle in , which was the prototype of the Temple in Jerusalem and the focus of priestly worship of Yahweh; for this reason, and because other Middle Eastern creation stories also climax with the construction of a temple/house for the creator god, Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a description of the construction of the cosmos as God&#x27;s house, for which the Temple in Jerusalem served as the earthly representative.

=== Pre-creation (Genesis 1:1–2) ===
:1 In the beginning God [Elohim] created the heaven and the earth.
:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit [] of God moved upon the face of the waters.

The opening phrase of Genesis 1:1 is traditionally translated in English as &quot;in the beginning God created&quot;. This translation suggests (). The Hebrew, however, is ambiguous and can be translated in other ways. The NRSV translates verses 1 and 2 as, &quot;In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void...&quot; This translation suggests that earth, in some way, already existed when God began his creative activity. 

Biblical scholars John Day and David Toshio Tsumura argue that Genesis 1:1 describes the initial creation of the universe, the former writing: &quot;Since the inchoate earth and the heavens in the sense of the air/wind were already in existence in Gen. 1:2, it is most natural to assume that Gen. 1:1 refers to God&#x27;s creative act in making them.&quot; Other scholars such as R. N. Whybray, Christine Hayes, Michael Coogan, Cynthia Chapman, and John H. Walton argue that Genesis 1:1 describes the creation of an ordered universe out of preexisting, chaotic material.

The word &quot;created&quot; translates the Hebrew , a word used only for God&#x27;s creative activity; people do not engage in . Walton argues that does not necessarily refer to the creation of matter. In the ancient Near East, &quot;to create&quot; meant assigning roles and functions. The which God performs in Genesis 1 concerns bringing &quot;heaven and earth&quot; from chaos into ordered existence. Day disputes Walton&#x27;s functional interpretation of the creation narrative. Day argues that material creation is the &quot;only natural way of taking the text&quot; and that this interpretation was the only one for most of history. 

Most interpreters consider the phrase &quot;heaven and earth&quot; to be a merism meaning the entire cosmos. Genesis 1:2 describes the earth as &quot;formless and void&quot;. This phrase is a translation of the Hebrew (). by itself means &quot;emptiness, futility&quot;. It is used to describe the desert wilderness. has no known meaning, although it appears to be related to the Arabic word &quot;bahiya&quot; (&quot;to be empty&quot;), and was apparently coined to rhyme with and reinforce . The phrase appears also in Jeremiah 4:23 where the prophet warns Israel that rebellion against God will lead to the return of darkness and chaos, &quot;as if the earth had been &#x27;uncreated&#x27;&quot;.

Verse 2 continues, &quot;&quot;darkness&quot; was upon the face of the &quot;deep&quot;&quot;. The word &quot;deep&quot; translates the Hebrew (), a primordial ocean. Darkness and are two further elements of chaos in addition to . In &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;, the watery deep is personified as the goddess Tiamat, the enemy of Marduk. In Genesis, however, there is no such personification. The elements of chaos are not seen as evil but as indications that God has not begun his creative work. 

Verse 2 concludes with, &quot;And the of God [Elohim] moved upon the face of the waters.&quot; There are several options for translating the Hebrew word (). It could mean &quot;breath&quot;, &quot;wind&quot;, or &quot;spirit&quot; in different contexts. The traditional translation is &quot;spirit of God&quot;. In the Hebrew Bible, the spirit of God is understood to be an extension of God&#x27;s power. The term is analogous to saying the &quot;hand of the Lord&quot; (). Historically, Christian theologians supported &quot;spirit&quot; as it provided biblical support for the presence of the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, at creation. 

Other interpreters argue for translating as &quot;wind&quot;. For example, the NRSV renders it &quot;wind from God&quot;. Likewise, the word &#x27; can sometimes function as a superlative adjective (such as &quot;mighty&quot; or &quot;great&quot;). The phrase &#x27; may therefore mean &quot;great wind&quot;. The connection between wind and watery chaos is also seen in the Genesis flood narrative, where God uses wind to make the waters subside in Genesis 8:1. 

In &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;, the storm god Marduk defeats Tiamat with his wind. While stories of a cosmic battle prior to creation were familiar to ancient Israelites , there is no such battle in Genesis 1 though the text includes the primeval ocean and references to God&#x27;s wind. Instead, Genesis 1 depicts a single God whose power is uncontested and who brings order out of chaos.

===Six days of Creation (1:3–2:3)===
Creation takes place over six days. The creative acts are arranged so that the first three days set up the environments necessary for the creations of the last three days to thrive. For example, God creates light on the first day and the light-producing heavenly bodies on the fourth day.

Each day follows a similar literary pattern:
# Introduction: &quot;And God said&quot;
# Command: &quot;Let there be&quot; 
# Report: &quot;And it was so&quot;
# Evaluation: &quot;And God saw that it was good&quot;
# Time sequence: &quot;And there was evening, and there was morning&quot;

Verse 31 sums up all of creation with, &quot;God saw every thing that He had made, and, indeed, it was very good&quot;. According to biblical scholar R. N. Whybray, &quot;This is the craftsman&#x27;s assessment of his own work... It does not necessarily have an ethical connotation: it is not mankind that is said to be &#x27;good&#x27;, but God&#x27;s work as craftsman.&quot;

At the end of the sixth day, when creation is complete, the world is a cosmic temple in which the role of humanity is the worship of God. This parallels &quot;Enuma Elish&quot; and also echoes Job 38, where God recalls how the stars, the &quot;sons of God&quot;, sang when the corner-stone of creation was laid.

====First day (1:3–5)====
The process of creation illustrates God&#x27;s sovereignty and omnipotence. God creates by fiat; things come into existence by divine decree. Like a king, God has merely to speak for things to happen. On day one, God creates light and separates the light from the darkness. Then he names them. God therefore creates time. 

Creation by speech is not found in Mesopotamian mythology, but it is present in some ancient Egyptian creation myths. While some Egyptian accounts have a god creating the world by sneezing or masturbating, the Memphite Theology has Ptah create by speech. In Genesis, creative acts begin with speech and are finalized with naming. This has parallels in other ancient Near Eastern cultures. In the Memphite Theology, the creator god names everything. Similarly, &quot;Enuma Elish&quot; begins when heaven, earth, and the gods were unnamed. Walton writes, &quot;In this way of thinking, things did not exist unless they were named.&quot; According to biblical scholar Nahum Sarna, this similarity is &quot;wholly superficial&quot; because in other ancient narratives creation by speech involves magic:

====Second day (1:6–8)====


On day two, God creates the firmament (), which is named ( or ), to divide the waters. Water was a &quot;primal generative force&quot; in pagan mythologies. In Genesis, however, the primeval ocean possesses no powers and is completely at God&#x27;s command.

 is derived from , the verb used for the act of beating metal into thin plates. Ancient people throughout the world believed the sky was solid, and the firmament in Genesis 1 was understood to be a solid dome. In ancient near eastern cosmology, the earth is a flat disc surrounded by the waters above and the waters below. The firmament is a solid dome that rests on mountains at the edges of the earth. It is transparent, allowing men to see the blue of the waters above with &quot;windows&quot; to allow rain to fall. The sun, moon and stars are underneath the firmament. Deep within the earth is the underworld or Sheol. The earth is supported by pillars sunk into the waters below.

The waters above are the source of precipitation, so the function of the was to control or regulate the weather. In the Genesis flood narrative, &quot;all the fountains of the great deep burst forth&quot; from the waters beneath the earth and from the &quot;windows&quot; of the sky.

====Third day (1:9–13)====
By the end of the third day God has created a foundational environment of light, heavens, seas and earth. God does not create or make trees and plants, but instead commands the earth to produce them. The underlying theological meaning seems to be that God has given the previously barren earth the ability to produce vegetation, and it now does so at his command. &quot;According to (one&#x27;s) kind&quot; appears to look forward to the laws found later in the Pentateuch, which lay great stress on holiness through separation.

In the first three days, God set up time, climate, and vegetation, all necessary for the proper functioning of the cosmos. For ancient peoples living in an agrarian society, climatic or agricultural disasters could cause widespread suffering through famine. Nevertheless, Genesis 1 describes God&#x27;s original creation as &quot;good&quot;—the natural world was not originally a threat to human survival.

The three levels of the cosmos are next populated in the same order in which they were created—heavens, sea, earth.

====Fourth day (1:14–19)====


On the first day, God makes light (Hebrew:). On the fourth day, God makes &quot;lights&quot; or &quot;lamps&quot; (Hebrew:) set in the firmament. This is the same word used elsewhere in the Pentateuch for the lampstand or menorah in the Tabernacle, another reference to the cosmos being a temple. Specifically, God creates the &quot;greater light&quot;, the &quot;lesser light&quot;, and the stars. According to Victor Hamilton, most scholars agree that the choice of &quot;greater light&quot; and &quot;lesser light&quot;, rather than the more explicit &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;moon&quot;, is anti-mythological rhetoric intended to contradict widespread contemporary beliefs in sun and moon deities. Indeed, Rashi posits that the account of the fourth day reveals that the sun and the moon operate only according to the will of God, and so demonstrates that it is foolish to worship them.

On day four, the language of &quot;ruling&quot; is introduced. The heavenly bodies will &quot;govern&quot; day and night and mark seasons, years and days. This was a matter of crucial importance to the Priestly authors, as the three pilgrimage festivals were organised around the cycles of both the sun and moon in a lunisolar calendar that could have either 12 or 13 months. 

In Genesis 1:17, the stars are set in the firmament. In Babylonian myth, the heavens were made of various precious stones with the stars engraved in their surface (compare Exodus 24:10 where the elders of Israel see God on the sapphire floor of heaven).
====Fifth day (1:20–23)====
On day five, God creates animals of the sea and air. In Genesis 1:20, the Hebrew term () is first used. They are of higher status than all that has been created before this, and they receive God&#x27;s blessing.

The Hebrew word (translated as &quot;sea creatures&quot; or &quot;sea monsters&quot;) in Genesis 1:21 is used elsewhere in the Bible in reference to chaos-monsters named Rahab and Leviathan (Psalm 74:13, Isaiah 27:1 and 51:9). In Egyptian and Mesopotamian mythologies (&quot;Instruction of Merikare&quot; and &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;), the creator-god has to do battle with the sea-monsters before he can make heaven and earth. In Genesis, however, there is no hint of combat, and the are simply creatures created by God. The Genesis account, therefore, is an explicit polemic against the mythologies of the ancient world.

====Sixth day (1:24–31)====

On day six, God creates land animals and humans. Like the animals of the sea and air, the land animals are designated (). They are divided into three categories: domesticated animals (), whild herd animals that serve as prey (), and wild predators (). The earth &quot;brings forth&quot; animals in the same way that it brought forth vegetation on day three.

In Genesis 1:26, God says &quot;Let &quot;us&quot; make man...&quot; This has given rise to several theories, of which the two most important are that &quot;us&quot; is majestic plural, or that it reflects a setting in a divine council with God enthroned as king and proposing the creation of mankind to the lesser divine beings. A traditional interpretation is that &quot;us&quot; refers to a plurality of persons in the Godhead, which reflects Trinitarianism. Some justify this by stating that the plural reveals a &quot;duality within the Godhead&quot; that recalls the &quot;Spirit of God&quot; mentioned in verse 2; &quot;And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters&quot;.

The creation of mankind is the climax of the creation account and God&#x27;s implied purpose for creating the world. Everything created up to this point was made for humanity&#x27;s use. Man was created in the &quot;image of God&quot;. The meaning of this is unclear but suggestions include:
# Having the spiritual qualities of God such as intellect, will, etc.;
# Having the physical form of God;
# A combination of these two;
# Being God&#x27;s counterpart on Earth and able to enter into a relationship with him;
# Being God&#x27;s representative or viceroy on Earth;
# Having dominion over Creation like the angels in ;
# Moral excellence and the possibility of glorification (cf. ; ; ).

When in Genesis 1:26 God says &quot;Let us make man&quot;, the Hebrew word used is &quot;adam&quot;; in this form it is a generic noun, &quot;mankind&quot;, and does not imply that this creation is male. After this first mention the word always appears as &quot;ha-adam&quot;, &quot;the man&quot;, but as Genesis 1:27 shows (&quot;So God created man in his &quot;[own]&quot; image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.&quot;), the word is still not exclusively male.

God blesses humanity, commanding them to reproduce, &quot;subdue&quot; () the earth and &quot;rule&quot; () over it, in what is known as the cultural mandate. Humanity is to extend the Kingdom of God beyond Eden, and, imitating the Creator-God, is to labour to bring the earth into its service, to the end of the fulfilment of the mandate. This would include the procreation of offspring, the subjugation and replenishment of the earth (e.g., the use of natural resources), dominion over creatures (e.g., animal domestication), labor in general, and marriage. God tells the animals and humans that he has given them &quot;the green plants for food&quot;creation is to be vegetarian. Only later, after the Flood, is man given permission to eat flesh. The Priestly author of Genesis appears to look back to an ideal past in which mankind lived at peace both with itself and with the animal kingdom, and which could be re-achieved through a proper sacrificial life in harmony with God.

Upon completion, God sees that &quot;every thing that He had made ... was very good&quot; (). According to Israel Knohl, this implies that the materials that existed before the Creation (&quot;&quot;tohu wa-bohu&quot;,&quot; &quot;darkness&quot;, &quot;tehom&quot;) were not &quot;very good&quot;. He thus hypothesized that the Priestly source set up this dichotomy to mitigate the problem of evil. However according to Collins, since the creation of man is the climax of the first creation account, &quot;very good&quot; must signify the presentation of man as the crown of God&#x27;s creation, which is to serve him.

====Seventh day: divine rest (2:1–3)====


These three verses belong with and complete the narrative in chapter 1. Creation is followed by &quot;rest&quot;. In ancient Near Eastern literature the divine rest is achieved in a temple as a result of having brought order to chaos. Rest is both disengagement, as the work of creation is finished, but also engagement, as the deity is now present in his temple to maintain a secure and ordered cosmos. Compare with Exodus 20:8–20:11: &quot;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the thy , in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.&quot;

==Second narrative: Genesis 2:4–2:25==
Genesis 2–3, the Garden of Eden story, was probably authored around 500 BCE as &quot;a discourse on ideals in life, the danger in human glory, and the fundamentally ambiguous nature of humanity – especially human mental faculties&quot;. The Garden in which the action takes place lies on the mythological border between the human and the divine worlds, probably on the far side of the cosmic ocean near the rim of the world; following a conventional ancient Near Eastern concept, the Eden river first forms that ocean and then divides into four rivers which run from the four corners of the earth towards its centre. According to Meredith Kline, who represents covenant theology and the framework interpretation, the narrative establishes the site of the &quot;climactic probation test&quot;, which is also where the &quot;covenant crisis&quot; of Genesis 3 occurs.

The pericope that constitutes the second narrative is generally taken to begin at (&quot;These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,&quot;) because it is widely recognized as a chiasmus (in the following quote, each subject of the chiasmus is preceded by &quot;[&quot;x&quot;]&quot; to denote its place in the chiastic configuration; &quot;These are the generations [&quot;a&quot;] of the heavens [&quot;b&quot;] and of the earth [&quot;c&quot;] when they were created [&quot;c″&quot;] in the day that the God made [&quot;b″&quot;] the earth [&quot;a″&quot;] and the heavens&quot;).

=== The origin of humanity and plant life (2:4–7) ===
The content of the verse 4 opening is a set introduction similar to those found in Babylonian myths. Before the man is created, the earth is a barren waste watered by an &quot;’êḏ&quot; (); of the King James Version has the translation &quot;mist&quot; for this word, following Jewish practice. Since the mid-20th century, Hebraists have generally accepted that the real meaning is &quot;spring of underground water&quot;.

In Genesis 1 the characteristic word for God&#x27;s activity is &quot;bara&quot;, &quot;created&quot;; in Genesis 2 the word used when he creates the man is &quot;yatsar&quot; ( &quot;yîṣer&quot;), meaning &quot;fashioned&quot;, a word used in contexts such as a potter fashioning a pot from clay. God breathes his own breath into the clay and it becomes &quot;nephesh&quot; (), a word meaning &quot;life&quot;, &quot;vitality&quot;, &quot;the living personality&quot;; man shares &quot;nephesh&quot; with all creatures, but the text describes this life-giving act by God only in relation to man.

=== The Garden of Eden (2:8–14) ===

The word &quot;Eden&quot; comes from a root meaning &quot;fertility&quot;: the first man is to work in God&#x27;s miraculously fertile garden. The &quot;tree of life&quot; is a motif from Mesopotamian myth: in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; (c. 1800 BCE) the hero is given a plant whose name is &quot;man becomes young in old age&quot;, but a serpent steals the plant from him. Kline regards the tree of life as a symbol or seal of the reward of eternal life for successful fulfilment of the covenant by humanity. There has been much scholarly discussion about the type of knowledge given by the second tree. Suggestions include: human qualities, sexual consciousness, ethical knowledge, or universal knowledge; with the last being the most widely accepted. In Eden, mankind has a choice between wisdom and life, and chooses the first, although God intended them for the second.

The mythic Eden and its rivers may represent the real Jerusalem, the Temple and the Promised Land. Eden may represent the divine garden on Zion, the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem; while the real Gihon was a spring outside the city (mirroring the spring which waters Eden); and the imagery of the Garden, with its serpent and cherubs, has been seen as a reflection of the real images of the Temple of Solomon with its copper serpent (the nehushtan) and guardian cherubs. Genesis 2 is the only place in the Bible where Eden appears as a geographic location: elsewhere (notably in the Book of Ezekiel) it is a mythological place located on the holy Mountain of God, with echoes of a Mesopotamian myth of the king as a primordial man placed in a divine garden to guard the tree of life &quot;in the midst of the garden&quot; (2:9).

=== God&#x27;s covenant with Adam (2:15–17) ===
Kline states that the terms of the covenant (a divine legal transaction with divinely sanctioned commitments), specifically the Covenant of Works, are summarised in verses 15-17. In verse 15, humanity is to &quot;dress&quot; and &quot;keep&quot; the garden (KJV), or to &quot;work it&quot; and &quot;take care of it&quot; (NIV). In verse 17, God gives the &quot;focal probationary proscription&quot;, that Adam must not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which refers to &quot;judicial discernment&quot; (cf. ; ) and a curse is attached if the proscription is transgressed, which is said to be death, although Kline interprets this to be spiritual death or eternal perdition rather than physical death. The Hebrew behind this is in the form used in the Bible for issuing death sentences. &quot;Good and evil&quot; can also be interpreted as a merism, so in this case it would mean simply &quot;everything&quot;.

=== A suitable helper (2:18–25) ===
After God&#x27;s observation that it is &quot;not good that man should be alone&quot; in , but before he causes Adam to sleep, then creating Eve from his side in verses 21–22, Adam&#x27;s first recorded action is carried out alone, his naming of each of the other creatures brought to him by God (). This appears to be an exercise of the authority and the dominion given to Adam in . Verse 20 also states that, among all the animals, none was found to be a suitable helper for him, which leads into the account of the creation of Eve.

The first woman is created out of one of Adam&#x27;s ribs to be &quot;ezer kenegdo&quot; ( &quot;‘êzer kəneḡdō&quot;) – a term notably difficult to translate – to the man. &quot;Kəneḡdō&quot; means &quot;alongside, opposite, a counterpart to him&quot;, and &quot;‘êzer&quot; means active intervention on behalf of the other person. God&#x27;s naming of the elements of the cosmos in Genesis 1 illustrated his authority over creation; now the man&#x27;s naming of the animals (and of Woman) illustrates Adam&#x27;s authority within creation.

The woman is called &quot;ishah&quot; ( &quot;’iš-šāh&quot;), &quot;Woman&quot;, with an explanation that this is because she was taken from &quot;ish&quot; ( &quot;’îš&quot;), meaning &quot;man&quot;, but the two words are not in fact connected. 

Adam rejoices at being given a helper, exclaiming (or singing) that she is &quot;bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh&quot;. Henri Blocher refers to Adam&#x27;s words as &quot;poetry&quot;; Alistair Wilson proposes that they should be treated as &quot;song&quot;.

Later, after the story of the Garden is complete, the woman receives a name: &quot;Ḥawwāh&quot; (, Eve). This means &quot;living&quot; in Hebrew, from a root that can also mean &quot;snake&quot;. Assyriologist Samuel Noah Kramer connects Eve&#x27;s creation to the ancient Sumerian myth of Enki, who was healed by the goddess Nin-ti, &quot;the Lady of the rib&quot;; this became &quot;the Lady who makes live&quot; via a pun on the word , which means both &quot;rib&quot; and &quot;to make live&quot; in Sumerian. The Hebrew word traditionally translated &quot;rib&quot; in English can also mean &quot;side&quot;, &quot;chamber&quot;, or &quot;beam&quot;. A long-standing exegetical tradition holds that the use of a rib from man&#x27;s side emphasises that both man and woman have equal dignity, for woman was created from the same material as man, shaped and given life by the same processes.

==Interpretations==
===Hexameral literature===

The Genesis creation narrative inspired a genre of Jewish and Christian literature known as the Hexameral literature. This literature was dedicated to the composition of commentaries, homilies, and treatises concerned with the exegesis of the biblical creation narrative through ancient and medieval times. The first Christian example of this genre was the &quot;Hexaemeron&quot; of the fourth-century theologian Basil of Caesarea, and many other works went on to be written by authors including Augustine of Hippo, Jacob of Serugh, Jacob of Edessa, Bonaventure, and so on.

===Framework interpretation===
The framework interpretation (also known as the &quot;literary framework&quot; view, &quot;framework theory&quot;, or &quot;framework hypothesis&quot;) is a description of the structure of the first creation narrative (more precisely, ). Biblical scholars and theologians present the structure as evidence that the first creation narrative constitutes a symbolic rather than literal presentation of creation.

==== Two triads and three kingdoms ====
Kline&#x27;s analysis divides the six days of creation in Genesis into two groups of three (&quot;triads&quot;). The introduction, Genesis 1:1–2, &quot;In the beginning… the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep…&quot;, describes the primal universe containing darkness, a watery &quot;deep&quot;, and a formless earth, over which hovers the spirit of God. The following three days describe the first triad: the creation of light and its separation from the primal darkness (Genesis 1:3–5); the creation of the &quot;firmament&quot; within the primal waters so that the heavens (space between the firmament and the surface of the seas) and the &quot;waters under the firmament&quot; can appear (Genesis 1:6–8); and the separation of the waters under the firmament into seas and dry land with its plants and trees. The second triad describes the peopling of the three elements of the first: sun, moon, and stars for the day and night (Genesis 1:14–19), fish and birds for the heavens and seas (Genesis 1:20–23), and finally animals and man for the vegetated land (24–31). This framework is illustrated in the following table.

Differences exist in classifying the two triads, but Kline&#x27;s analysis is suggestive: the first triad (days 1–3) narrates the establishment of the creation kingdoms, and the second triad (days 4–6), the production of the creature kinds. Furthermore, this structure is not without theological significance, for all the created realms and regents of the six days are subordinate vassals of God, who takes his royal Sabbath rest as the Creator on the seventh day. Thus, the seventh day marks the climax of the creation week.

====Supporters and critics====
The framework interpretation is held by many theistic evolutionists and some progressive creationists. Some argue that it has a precedent in the writings of the Church Father Augustine of Hippo. Arie Noordzij of the University of Utrecht was the first proponent of the Framework Hypothesis in 1924. Nicolaas Ridderbos (not to be confused with his more well-known brother, Herman Nicolaas Ridderbos) popularized the view in the late 1950s. It has gained acceptance in modern times through the work of such theologians and scholars as Meredith G. Kline, Henri Blocher, John H. Walton and Bruce Waltke. Old Testament and Pentateuch scholar Gordon Wenham supports a schematic interpretation of Genesis 1 as described in the following quote.
The framework view has been successful in the modern era because it is seen as a resolution of the traditional conflict between the Genesis creation narrative and contemporary science. It presents an alternative to literalist interpretations of the Genesis narratives, which are advocated by some conservative Christians and creationists at a popular level. Creationists who take a literalist approach reject symbolic or allegorical interpretations of the Genesis creation narrative as conceding to scientific authority at the expense of biblical authority. Advocates of the framework view respond by noting that scripture affirms God&#x27;s general revelation in nature (see ; ); therefore, in the search for the truth about the origins of the universe, we must be sensitive to both the &quot;book of words&quot; (scripture) and the &quot;book of works&quot; (nature). Since God is the author of both &quot;books&quot;, we should expect that they do not conflict with each other when properly interpreted.

Opponents of the framework interpretation include James Barr, Andrew Steinmann, Robert McCabe, and Ting Wang. Additionally, some conservative systematic theologians, such as Wayne Grudem and Millard Erickson, have criticised the framework interpretation, deeming it an unsuitable reading of the Genesis text. Grudem states that &quot;while the &#x27;framework&#x27; view does not deny the truthfulness of Scripture, it adopts an interpretation of Scripture which, upon closer inspection, seems very unlikely&quot;.

=== Literal interpretations ===
The meaning to be derived from the Genesis creation narrative will depend on the reader&#x27;s understanding of its genre, the literary &quot;type&quot; to which it belongs (e.g., creation myth, historical saga, or scientific cosmology). 

While biblical criticism has deconstructed many traditional views on the Bible, conservative evangelical traditions have tended to interpret the Genesis creation narrative in a literal way but have also engaged in (sometimes heated) disputes on the interpretation of Genesis.

According to Biblical scholar Francis Andersen, misunderstanding the intention of the author(s) and the culture within which they wrote will result in a misreading. Reformed and evangelical scholar Bruce Waltke cautions against one such misreading: the &quot;woodenly literal&quot; approach, which leads to &quot;creation science&quot;, but also to such &quot;implausible interpretations&quot; as the &quot;gap theory&quot;, the presumption of a &quot;young earth&quot;, and the denial of evolution. Scholar of Jewish studies Jon D. Levenson goes further in doubting whether historicity can be attributed to Genesis at all:
Another scholar, Conrad Hyers, summed up the same thought by writing, &quot;A literalist interpretation of the Genesis accounts is inappropriate, misleading, and unworkable [because] it presupposes and insists upon a kind of literature and intention that is not there.&quot;

<text>The Principality of Anjewaci or Andzewatsi was an Armenian dynasty of Median or Carduchian ancestry, who ruled in an eponymous region in southern Armenia (modern southeastern Anatolia in today&#x27;s south east Turkey). It was located in southeast of Lake Van and northwest of &quot;Ake&quot; and centered at the castle of Kangvar.

In 780, its chief prince Tachat Andzevatsi was under the suzerainty of the Abbasid Caliph. After him, the dynasty declined and it was reduced to vassalage of the Artsrunis in 860.

<text>Khari Stephenson (; born 18 January 1981) is a Jamaican former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

==Youth and College==
A product of the Real Mona youth system, Stephenson played college soccer at Williams College from 2000 to 2003, where he was named a Division III first-team All-American his junior and senior seasons. In his senior year, Stephenson scored 15 goals for the team, and finished his career there with 40 goals and 18 assists. Before playing at Williams, he was a star of his prep school soccer team at Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut.

== Club career ==

=== Kansas City Wizards (2004–2005) ===
Upon graduating, Stephenson was drafted 27th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by Chicago Fire. He did not make the Fire team, however, and was traded to Kansas City Wizards for a third-round 2005 MLS SuperDraft pick. Stephenson played very little for the Wizards in his rookie season, finishing the year with no points, having played only 44 minutes over three games. He became a starter in the playoffs, playing in every game and even scoring a goal on the Wizards&#x27; run to the final.

=== Move to Scandinavia (2006–2010) ===
In 2006, Stephenson made his move to Scandinavia, starting in Sweden with GAIS, where he had an outstanding season as a midfielder. He then made a move to AIK in 2007, where he had an inconsistent season for a team that finished in the top half of the league. In August 2008, Khari then moved to Aalesunds FK in Norway, where he was joined by Jamaican international teammate Demar Phillips in the midfield. After not receiving significant playing time in early 2009, he gained a vital midfield role as the season progressed, eventually leading the team to the Norwegian Cup in 2009 and qualification for the 2010/11 Europa Cup.

=== San Jose Earthquakes (2010–2012) ===
Stephenson returned to the United States on loan from Aalesunds FK and signed with the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer on 9 August 2010 until the remainder of the MLS season. Stephenson returned to Norway and then signed a permanent deal on 14 February 2011 with San Jose Earthquakes.

Stephenson remained with San Jose through the 2012 season before being released following the 2012 season. He subsequently entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a free agent after going undrafted in both rounds of the draft.

=== Real Salt Lake (2013) ===
On 22 February 2013, he was signed by Real Salt Lake. He played one season in Utah; however, he was not retained following the season.

=== Return to San Jose (2014–present) ===
Stephenson signed for his old club San Jose Earthquakes on 11 March 2014.
Stephenson scored 2 goals during the 2014 season.

=== San Antonio Scorpions (2015 loan) ===
On 6 August 2015, Stephenson was loaned from San Jose to San Antonio Scorpions of the North American Soccer League.

==International career==
Stephenson appeared for the Jamaican U-20&#x27;s in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship in Argentina and made his debut for the &#x27;Reggae Boyz&#x27; in 2004 against Guatemala. He has earned 32 caps (3 goals).

==Personal life==
Stephenson holds a U.S. green card which qualifies him as a domestic player for MLS roster purposes.

<doc id="1116264" wikidata="Q279376" url="?curid=1116264" title="Australian labour movement">
<text>The Australian labour movement began in the early 19th century and since the late 19th century has included industrial (Australian unions) and political wings (Australian Labor Party). Trade unions in Australia may be organised (i.e., formed) on the basis of craft unionism, general unionism, or industrial unionism. Almost all unions in Australia are affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), many of which have undergone a significant process of amalgamations, especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The leadership and membership of unions hold and have at other times held a wide range of political views, including socialist, democratic and right-wing views.

According to ABS figures, in August 2013, there were 1.7 million members of trade unions in relation to their main job (17% of all employees). A further 4% did not know whether they were trade union members or not, while 1% were trade union members not in conjunction with their main job. Of those who were a trade union member in relation to their main job, over two-thirds (68%) had been members for five years or more. Trade union membership has steadily declined over recent years, with 2013 being the lowest proportion in the history of the ABS series. According to ACTU figures, the number of members of trade unions in 1983 was 2,376,900 but by 2002 it was 1,833,700, and declining.

The Australian Labor Party at both a federal and state/colony level pre-dates, among others, both the British Labour Party and the New Zealand Labour Party in party formation, government, and policy implementation. In particular, the 1910 federal election represented a number of firsts: it was Australia&#x27;s first elected federal majority government; Australia&#x27;s first elected Senate majority; the world&#x27;s first Labour Party majority government at a national level; after the 1904 Chris Watson minority government the world&#x27;s second Labour Party government at a national level; and the first time it controlled &quot;both&quot; houses of a bicameral legislature.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In 1788, the First Fleet landed in Sydney and subsequently established the colony of New South Wales as a penal colony. Working conditions were analogous to slavery, with convicts that were transported to the colony required to work, without pay, for either the colony&#x27;s administration or private landholders. Others, particularly the &quot;Kanaka&quot; from the South Pacific islands, were either kidnapped or otherwise induced into exploitative long-term indentured service contracts.

Initially, following British laws, trade unions in Australia were suppressed, particularly under the Combination Laws of 1799 and 1800. A trade union or other association could also be regarded as illegal because of being considered a &quot;restraint of trade&quot;. The British Master and Servant Act 1823, and subsequent updates, were generally regarded as heavily biased towards employers, and designed to discipline employees and repress the &quot;combination&quot; of workers in trade unions. The law required the obedience and loyalty from servants (i.e., workers) to their contracted employer, with infringements of the contract, or disobedience, subject to criminal penalties, often with a jail sentence of hard labour; and the calling for strikes was punished as an &quot;aggravated&quot; breach of contract. Over time though, the position was slowly liberalised and through the British Trade Union Act 1871, alongside the subsequent Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875, trade unions were legitimised. Craft unions in Australia began in the early 19th century as craft associations of highly skilled urban workers who sought to organise (form a labour union), to increase their low wages and decrease their high number of hours.

By 1902, the Master and Servant Act 1823 had been modified to include forfeit of wages if the written or unwritten contract for work was unfulfilled. Absence from place of work was punishable by imprisonment of up to three months with or without hard labour. There were also penalties of up to £10 for anyone who harboured, concealed or re-employed a &#x27;servant&#x27; who had deserted or absconded or absented himself from his duty implied in the &#x27;contract&#x27;. The Act was used against workers organising for better conditions from its inception until well after the first United Kingdom Trade Union Act 1871 was implemented, which secured the legal status of trade unions. Under the Master and Servant Acts enacted in the Australian colonies in the 1840s, employees who left their employment without permission were subject to being hunted down under the Bushrangers Act. As little as one hour&#x27;s absence by a free servant without permission could precipitate a punishment of prison or the treadmill. In the Melbourne jurisdiction, between 1835 and 1845, when labour shortages were acute, over 20% of prison inmates were convicted under the New South Wales &quot;Master and Servant Act&quot; for offences including leaving place of work without permission and being found in hotels.

==== Eight-hour day campaign ====

In the 1800s, most Victorians worked up to 14 hours a day, six days a week. There was no sick leave, no holiday leave, and employers could sack employees at any time, without giving a reason.

On 18 August 1855 the Stonemasons Society in Sydney issued an ultimatum to employers that in six months time, masons would only work an eight-hour day. However men working on the Holy Trinity Church (Garrison Church) in Argyle Cut, and on the Mariners Church, (an evangelical mission to seafarers, now an art gallery and café) in Lower George Street (98-100 George Street), could not contain their enthusiasm and decided not to wait. They pre-emptively went on strike, won the eight-hour day, and celebrated with a victory dinner on 1 October 1855. On 21 April 1856 Stonemasons led by Cooper Bridges, building workers on building sites around Melbourne stopped work and marched from the University of Melbourne to Parliament House to achieve an eight-hour day. Their direct action protest was a success, and they are noted as being among the first organised workers in the world to achieve the eight-hour day with no loss of pay.

It took further campaigning and struggles by trade unions to extend the reduction in hours to all workers in Australia. In 1916, the Victorian &quot;Eight Hours Act&quot; was passed granting the eight-hour day to a wide range of workers in the state. The eight-hour day was not achieved nationally until the 1920s, but that was in the context of a 48-hour week. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court gave approval of the 40-hour five-day working week nationally beginning on 1 January 1948.

==== Trades Halls ====

During 1856 the Melbourne Trades Hall Committee was formed and received a grant of land to build the Melbourne Trades Hall, which was completed in 1859. The Trades and Labor Council of Sydney was formed by eight unions in 1871, and Sydney Trades Hall was built between 1888 and 1895. The United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia has a history dating back to 1884.

==== 1890s great strikes ====
As the craft union movement broadened, less skilled and rural workers began to organise which led to the colonies of Australia being convulsed by a number of great strikes in the 1890s; The response to these events of union action saw the use of breakup actions. For Instance, the 1890 maritime strike was met by the New South Wales and Victorian armed forces to combat protestors. The 1891 shearers&#x27; strike in Queensland was broken after 13 union leaders were charged with sedition and conspiracy, and convicted. The 1892 Broken Hill miners&#x27; strike in New South Wales collapsed after several strike leaders were arrested and tried for &#x27;unlawful conspiracy and inciting riots&#x27;, found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment and it became unpracticable for locals to defend the mines from imported labour. In the 1894 shearers&#x27; strike sheep shearers in Queensland struck against poor conditions and wages that were being lowered, with the strike broken by the use of non-union labour and police.

Each of these industrial conflicts was seen as a demoralising blow for the labour movement. William Lane and many others sought refuge in building a new society called New Australia in Paraguay. Others in the labour movement, demoralised with direct action, turned to a political solution and sought election to colonial parliaments, and led to the formation of the Australian Labor Party.

==== Trade union banners ====

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, trade union banners were unfurled with pride in annual eight-hour day marches which advocated &#x27;Eight Hours Labour, Eight Hours Recreation and Eight Hours Rest&#x27;. These marches were one of the most prominent annual celebrations staged in Australia by any group. In Sydney alone, by the early 20th century, thousands of unionists representing up to seventy different unions would take part in such parades, marching behind the banner emblematic of their trade. Most of these banners have not survived; Unions NSW has the largest surviving collection at Sydney Trades Hall in Sussex Street, Sydney.

The State Library of NSW has a small collection of trade union banners that were donated to the library in the early 1970s such as this photograph of a Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron &amp; Steel Shipbuilders of Australia banner thought to have been made c. 1913–1919. The banner features a kneeling figure in the centre surrounded by scroll work and is decorated with Australian native flowers and images representative of the work of union members such as a New South Wales Government Railways 34 class steam locomotive, the Hawkesbury River rail bridge built in 1889, and a furnace. The reverse of the banner shows the warship &quot;Australia&quot; at sea. The banner is painted on canvas.

==== Support for White Australia policy ====
Melbourne Trades Hall was opened in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe.

Australia gained a reputation as &quot;the working man&#x27;s paradise.&quot; Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the White Australia Policy. The &quot;Australian compact&quot;, based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century.

The growth of the sugar industry in Queensland in the 1870s led to searching for labourers prepared to work in a tropical environment. During this time, thousands of &quot;Kanakas&quot; (Pacific Islanders) were brought into Australia as indentured workers. This and related practices of bringing in non-white labour to be cheaply employed was commonly termed &quot;blackbirding&quot; and refers to the recruitment of people through trickery and kidnappings to work on plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations of Queensland (Australia) and Fiji. In the 1870s and 1880s, the growing trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for &quot;substandard&quot; wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation.

Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas. It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned. Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration. Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots.

Agreements were made to further increase these restrictions in 1895 following an Inter-colonial Premier&#x27;s Conference where all colonies agreed to extend entry restrictions to all non-white races. However, in attempting to enact this legislation, the Governors of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania reserved the bills, due to a treaty with Japan, and they did not become law. Instead, the Natal Act of 1897 was introduced, restricting &quot;undesirable persons&quot; rather than any specific race.

The British government in London was not pleased with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its Empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed. Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain explained in 1897:We quite sympathise with the determination...of these colonies...that there should not be an influx of people alien in civilisation, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labouring population.

The Barton government which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers Union and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.

=== Growth of the trade and industrial unions ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the union movement was in disarray across Australia. Only a few tough craft unions had survived. The majority of workers were un-unionised. A variety of skilled organisers turned this around and achieved remarkably high union membership density rates by 1914.

The threats of wild cat industrial action on a national level convinced the Federal Parliament to adopt a system of compulsory registration of unions, and compulsory arbitration in disputes. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act was assented to in 1904, and dictated the terrain of industrial relations conflicts and unionism until the 1990s.

In part this was caused by two new ideas of unionism: trade unionism and industrial unionism. Trade unionists sought to organise all people engaged in the same trade on job sites. Rather than simply organising the ditch diggers into one craft union and the dirt movers into another craft union, trade unionists sought to organise all people who moved earth into one union.

Industrial unionism went one step further, claiming that all workers on one worksite, diggers, plasterers, engine drivers, cleaners, caterers, engineers, accountants and clerks should belong to one union, as part of a &quot;construction industry.&quot; Industrial unionists sought to organise all workers into One Big Union which could then conduct a strike across the entire society and peacefully usher in socialism. The 1912 Brisbane General Strike showed the combined power of the labour movement, effectively operating as an alternative social administration for five weeks, undermining the power of the conservative government.

At the time there was no real conflict or division between the trade and industrial union mentality. Many supporters of the ALP in the Trades and Labour Councils were radical, militant and supported socialism.

=== Politics ===

The failure of each of the industrial conflicts of the 1890s was seen as a demoralising blow for the labour movement. Some unionists, demoralised with direct action, turned to a political solution and sought election to colonial parliaments, and led to the formation of the Australian Labor Party. The first general election contested by Labour candidates was the 1891 New South Wales election, where Labour Electoral League of New South Wales candidates won 35 of 141 seats, giving Labour the balance of power. Also in 1891, three United Labor Party (ULP) of South Australia candidates were elected to the South Australian Legislative Council. At the 1893 South Australian election the United Labor Party led by John McPherson won 10 of the 54 seats and the balance of power in the House of Assembly, allowing the liberal government of Charles Kingston to be formed, ousting the conservative government of John Downer. By the 1905 South Australian election Thomas Price became the first Labor Premier of South Australia. Re-elected at the 1906 double dissolution election serving until his death in 1909, it was the world&#x27;s first stable Labour Party government. So successful, John Verran led Labor to form the state&#x27;s first of many majority governments at the 1910 South Australian election. 

Labour candidates emerged in the late 19th century with much success, being a part of informal coalition governments from the early 1890s. In 1899, Anderson Dawson formed a Labour minority government in Queensland, the first Labour government in the world, which lasted one week while the conservatives regrouped after a split. . The first national Labour government in the world was that of Chris Watson in 1904, whose government lasted four months. Labour held the balance of power in the early years of federation, and was able to use it to secure the setting up of the protectionist system in Australia, and the passage of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, to set up a compulsory arbitration system in Australia. In the 1870s and 1880s, the trade union movement had organised a series of protests against &quot;foreign&quot; (by which was meant non-Anglo-Saxon) labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for &quot;substandard&quot; wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation. The movement gave support to the White Australia policy following federation, which involved the expulsion of the Kanakas (South Pacific islanders) and stopping all immigration of non-white people.

A scandalised establishment, took measures to counter Labour&#x27;s growing electoral dominance. Believing that an anti-socialist alliance was necessary, it pressured Deakin and Anti-Socialist Party&#x27;s new leader, Joseph Cook, to begin merger talks. The main body of Protectionists, including Deakin and his supporters, merged with the Anti-Socialist Party in May 1909 to become the Commonwealth Liberal Party. The more liberal Protectionists joined Labour.

The 1910 federal election was a straight two-party contest between Labour and the combined anti-Labour forces. The election delivered total victory to Labour under the leadership of Andrew Fisher. It delivered the first national Labour majority government in the world, the first national majority government in Australia, and the first Senate majority in Australia. The Fisher government was able to pass 113 Acts in the three years of the government, an unprecedented record, a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth up until that point. The Fisher government carried out many reforms dear to the labour movement in defence, constitutional matters, finance, transport and communications, and social security, such as establishing old-age and disability pensions, a maternity allowance and workers compensation, issuing Australia&#x27;s first paper currency, forming the Royal Australian Navy, the commencement of construction for the Trans-Australian Railway, expanding the bench of the High Court of Australia, founding Canberra and establishing the government-owned Commonwealth Bank.

The state branches formed their first majority governments in New South Wales and South Australia in 1910, in Western Australia in 1911, and in Queensland in 1915. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years.

=== World War I ===
The chief proponent of industrial unionism in Australia was the Industrial Workers of the World, which actively sought out conflicts with management. The IWW also acted on a political plane, opposing boyhood conscription, then the first world war. The Australian labour movement united around opposition to conscription, largely due to vocal opposition by the IWW and Catholic archbishop of Melbourne, Daniel Mannix. Two referendum proposals to introduce conscription by Labor Prime Minister Billy Hughes were defeated, making Australia and South Africa the only nations at war during the First World War not to introduce conscription.

The Labor governments of Hughes in the Federal sphere, and William Holman in New South Wales, were held in low regard by much of the labour movement due to their policies on military conscription.

On 23 September 1916 twelve members of the IWW (most of them active organisers) were arrested and charged with treason under the &quot;Treason Felony Act (1848)&quot;. As four buildings had been deliberately damaged by fire, the charge of arson was added to the charges. They became known as the Sydney Twelve with many unions and people in the labour movement actively campaigning for their release for several years.

The &quot;Unlawful Associations Act (1916)&quot; was rushed through Federal Parliament in late December and the IWW was declared an illegal organisation. The IWW simply changed its name to &quot;Workers&#x27; Defence and Release Committee&quot;, and continued as normal. In late July 1917 the Act was amended resulting in any organisation or individual able to be easily proscribed. In return the IWW ran a &#x27;free speech movement&#x27; campaign in which over 80 members in Sydney were sentenced to 6 months hard labour (the maximum) for simply proclaiming their membership, which was enough to scare many others away from open defiance. Those not born in Australia were subsequently deported at the end of their sentences, mostly to Chile. A chain of international protests about the Sydney Twelve IWW prisoners followed. (&quot;Sydney&#x27;s Burning (An Australian Political Conspiracy)&quot;)

At the end of the first world war in Australia there were a number of major industrial and political actions which threatened the stability of society. In Queensland counter-revolutionary and racist riots broke out in the Red Flag Riots, when it was made illegal to fly or wear the red flag, except as a sign of danger. The New South Wales General Strike of 1917 started on 2 August 1917, by railway workers over the introduction of the Taylor system of determining where work could be speeded-up. It was the most widespread labour upheaval since the 1890s, and ended when mining workers returned to work on 15 October 1917.

=== Interwar period ===
The Communist Party of Australia was formed in October 1920 by a group of Trades Hall radicals that included Jock Garden, the members of the illegal IWW, and members of earlier socialist organisations in Australia. The party achieved some influence in the trade union movement in New South Wales, but by the mid-1920s it had dwindled to an insignificant sect, and Garden and other communists were expelled from the Labor Party in 1924. However, the Communist Party began to win positions in particular trade unions, such as the Miners Federation and the Waterside Workers&#x27; Federation of Australia.

Strikes in this period were commonplace, and remained threatening to the Commonwealth government, which took measures to control union activity. In 1926 the federal Crimes Act was amended for the Act to apply to unions and in 1928 the &quot;Transport Workers Act 1928&quot; (more commonly referred as the Dog Collar Act) was enacted, directed against the Waterside Workers&#x27; Federation. Of particular note is the 1923 Victorian Police strike.

Trade union membership was 703,000 in 1921 and reached its peak in 1927, according to Green and Cromwell, when trade union membership &quot;comprised less than 15 per cent of the whole population, only 47 per cent of the workforce.&quot; In 1931 union membership was 769,000.

==== The Great Depression ====
After the Transport Workers Act 1928, more widely known as &quot;The Dog Collar Act&quot;, was passed, the Australian union movement sought to protect itself by forming a permanent national trade union organisation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions. By this point the idea of trade unionism had won out over industrial unionism. This was in part encouraged by the industrial courts which freely gave registration to small, shop and trade-specific unions. While the Communist Party of Australia would always argue for industrial unions, the idea of industrial unions smouldered until the 1960s, and only received support from the ACTU and the ALP in the 1980s.

The Dog Collar Act was used to break up strong unions, in forestry and on the docks. These unions were perceived to be revolutionary, or at least militant. At the same time the fragmented trade unions sought to maintain member conditions in an environment of massive unemployment. For instance, rates of male unemployment in the industrial city of Newcastle never dropped below 20% throughout the 1920s. When the Great Depression hit, formal unemployment rates rose above 30%.

The 1929 Australian timber workers&#x27; strike was the first large strike during the depression when Justice Lukin handed down a new timber industry award that increased the working week from 44 to 48 hours and reduced wages. During the strike Lukin ordered a secret ballot to be held which was the first attempt to enforce a secret ballot in an industrial dispute.

A 15-month lockout during 1929–1930 of miners on the northern New South Wales coalfields was particularly bitter. The Rothbury riot resulted in police shooting at miners, killing Norman Brown and seriously injuring many more.

The trade union response to unemployment was not inspiring. Before the depression, some strong trade unions would provide welfare for unemployed members, and seek jobs for them. However, the depression rendered this system unworkable, where it existed at all. (Union welfare primarily existed in seasonal work with militant unions, like dock-working. It was precisely these unions that were attacked by the Dog Collar Act).

In response to the depression, the remains of the IWW set up a union for the unemployed. This idea was quickly taken up by both the CPA and the ALP, both of which established associations (not organised as unions of workers) for the unemployed. The militance of unemployed workers who identified with the CPA or ALP, and the spirit of universal unionism which remained from the IWW, changed these movements of the unemployed into effective unions. The unemployed unions attacked local councils, and occasionally landlords, in order to win conditions. Infamously, a series of CPA inspired riots occurred against evictions in Newtown, Bankstown, Newcastle and Wollongong. The unemployed movements did not win significant employment, payment or condition victories for the unemployed workers. No future union of the unemployed would ever match the achievements of the unemployed unions of the 1930s.

As Australia approached the Second World War, the Dalfram dispute of 1938 in Port Kembla showed that trade unions and workers were not afraid to take strike action on political issues, in this case the export of pig iron to a military aggressive Japan invading China. Although workers returned to work after 10 weeks and 2 days on strike, the &quot;Transport Workers Act of 1928&quot; (&quot;The Dog Collar Act&quot;) had been shown to be ineffective when concerted action and solidarity was undertaken. Attorney General Robert Menzies earned his nickname of Pig Iron Bob during this dispute as a result of significant union protest.

=== World War II and after ===

World War II created a significant feeling of sympathy for the Soviet Union among Australian workers, and the CPA attempted to take advantage of this by industrial agitation after the war in the 1948 Queensland Railway strike and the 1949 Australian coal strike (the first time the military were used in peacetime to break a strike), and disputes on the waterfront and in the meat industry. This attempt to seize control of the union movement failed and was the start of the decline in communist leadership and influence in the labour movement. At the same time, agitation by Catholic organisations such as the National Civic Council (or Groupers) started setting up Industrial Groups within unions to counter the influence of communists.

The 1950s and 1960s period were generally one of industrial peace, dictated by preference agreements and closed shops. This period saw union membership keep pace with the growth of the workforce.

The post-war years saw the Australian labour movement support Indigenous Australians in their fight for human rights, cultural rights and native title, through supporting the 1946 Pilbara strike, The Gurindji Strike at Wave Hill in the Northern Territory, equal pay for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, and support for the Noonkanbah people in their land rights dispute with the Western Australian Government over mining companies disturbing sacred sites.

During the 1960s, a number of unions became locked in contests with governments and employers. Governments relied on penal powers to keep union activists in line. The general strike over Clarrie O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s imprisonment broke the government law and ushered in a period of rising union demands. These demands existed in the context of a general social radicalisation under Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser.

The militant wave was broken by the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s Prices and Incomes Accord in 1984 under Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke. After 1984 industrial militance declined, and a newly amalgamated trade union movement presided over falls in real wages. In the 1985 Mudginberri dispute and the 1986 Dollar Sweet&#x27;s dispute employer organisations such as the National Farmers Federation successfully backed legal sanctions to defeat union industrial action. The 1989 Australian pilots&#x27; strike saw the Federal Labor government using RAAF planes and pilots to break industrial action by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, taken outside the Prices and Incomes Accord.

During the Hawke Labor government in the 1980s, Australia experienced a push for economic reform encompassing deregulation of a number of previously regulated markets, including the labour market. This was first pursued by the Keating Labor government in 1991, through the Enterprise Bargaining Agreements introduced into Australia under the Prices and Incomes Accord in 1991 (Mark VII). They later became the centrepiece of the Australian industrial relations system when the Accord was next revised in 1993 (Mark VIII). This ended nearly a century of centralised wage-fixing based industrial relations.

Under the post-1996 Howard Liberal government, increasing pressure was brought to bear on industrial relations reforms, aiming to reduce the industrial power of Australian trade unions. This included the introduction of Australian Workplace Agreements — individual contractual agreements on pay and conditions between an employee and employer — and the reduction of minimum conditions contained in Industrial awards. One of the first targets of the conservative Government was to undermine the power of the Maritime Union of Australia, through breaking its closed shop on waterfront labour. The 1998 Australian waterfront dispute resulted with the stevedoring firm, Patrick Corporation under CEO Chris Corrigan, attempting to sack its entire waterfront workforce of 1400 people through company restructuring. The Australian Council of Trade Unions condemned the sacking as a gross act of collusion between Patrick, the Government, and the National Farmers Federation, and with the threat of legal action against the Government and Patrick Corporation, a settlement was negotiated to allow some reform with the MUA retaining its effective closed shop.

When the Howard Liberal government won an unexpected Senate majority at the 2004 election, despite not being part of their election manifesto they took the opportunity to introduce WorkChoices, a decision which would ultimately seal their fate at the 2007 election.

==== WorkChoices ====
After the Howard Liberal government&#x27;s 2004 election victory, and with a majority in the Senate from 1 July 2005, changes to industrial laws to further reduce the collective bargaining power of trade unions continued. In May 2005 the Howard government announced its Industrial Relations changes known as WorkChoices. This legislation received widespread criticism from the Australian union movement, many religious and community groups and, significantly (but not widely reported), the International Labour Organization, of which Australia is a member.

On 30 June 2005, up to 100,000 people marched through Melbourne in opposition to the proposed industrial relations changes, with meetings also held in capital cities and regional towns around Australia.

On 15 November 2005, the ACTU organised a national day of protest, during which the ACTU estimated 546,000 people took part in marches and protests in Australia&#x27;s state capitals and other cities. The rallies were addressed by State premiers and religious leaders. Other notable Australians, including former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, also spoke in opposition to the industrial relations changes. John Howard said that the protests will not change his policy and employer groups estimated that 95% of the workforce did not attend.

The Bill was passed by the Senate, with minor amendments, by a vote of 35-33 on 2 December 2005 and received the Royal Assent on 14 December.

Following the defeat of the Howard Liberal government at the 2007 federal election, the Rudd Labor government moved quickly to outlaw Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) besides other changes.

WorkChoices legislation was superseded by the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot; on 1 July 2009 which, whilst seen as an improvement for workers, has attracted criticism from industry experts, the Australian Greens and organised labour, especially the Victorian Branch of the Electrical Trades Union. In May 2009 the findings of a secret report on the new legislation, commissioned by the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), were revealed. The report found that &quot;the act does not bring our laws into compliance with ILO standards&quot;. Geoff Borenstein, an in-house solicitor of the ETU stated that the Fair Work legislation breaches ILO conventions regarding the right to strike, industrial action generally and restrictions on the content of industrial instruments (awards, collective agreements &amp;c). Professor Ron McCallum of the University of Sydney asserts that the new legislation will &quot;probably&quot; be deemed a breach of international law by the International Labour Organization, particularly in regards to ILO Conventions 87 and 98.

== 457 visas ==

The &quot;Temporary Business (Long Stay)&quot; (subclass 457) visa was introduced soon after John Howard became Prime Minister in 1996. It soon became the most common visa for Australian or overseas employers to sponsor skilled overseas workers to work temporarily in Australia. From 2013, the visa became strongly criticised by Australian unions and others. It was replaced by the &quot;Temporary Skill Shortage Visa&quot; (subclass 482) on 18 March 2018 by the Turnbull government. 

== Overseas farm workers ==
=== Pacific labour scheme ===
In 2012 the Australian government introduced a seasonal worker scheme under the 416 and 403 visas to bring in Pacific Islander labour to work in the agricultural industry performing tasks such as picking fruit. By 2018, around 17,320 Islanders, mostly from Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga, had been employed with the majority being placed on farms in Queensland. Workers under this programme have often been subject to working long hours in extreme temperatures and being forced to live in squalid conditions. Poor access to clean water, adequate food and medical assistance has resulted in at least 12 deaths. These reports together with allegations of workers receiving as little as $10 a week after rent and transport deductions resulted in the &quot;Harvest Trail Inquiry&quot; into the conditions of migrant horticultural workers. The ACTU and other labour groups gave evidence. This inquiry confirmed widespread exploitation, intimidation and underpayment of workers with at least 55% of employers being non-compliant in regard to payments and conditions. (As was then standard in the industry, many workers were contracted under a &quot;piece rate&quot; of pay with no written agreement and no minimum hourly rate.) Even though some wages were recovered and a number of employers and contractors were fined, the inquiry found that much more regulation was needed. Despite this report, the government expanded the programme in 2018 with the Pacific Labour Scheme which included three year contracts. Critics have decried the scheme as modern day blackbirding with sixteen labourer deaths occurring between 2019 and 2021. After 1,181 seasonal workers ran away from their employers amidst allegations of inhumane conditions, the Australian government launched a campaign in 2021 warning the pickers that they would bring shame to their families if they absconded. 

=== Backpacker schemes ===
Slavery-like exploitation of young foreign tourists as agricultural labourers during the 2010s and 2020s on the subclass 417 Working Holiday visa have also been reported. On this visa these tourists, usually backpackers, are obligated to work 88 days in regional areas in order to get approval for the second year of the visa. Widespread sexual harassment, wages as low as $2.50 to $4 an hour and blackmail have been described.

The introduction of the &quot;Modern Slavery Act 2018&quot; into Australian law was partly based upon concerns of slavery being evident in the agricultural sector. Further to this, a landmark provisional ruling by the Fair Work Commission in November 2021 ruled that farm workers in Australia on piece rates must be paid a minimum wage of $25.41 an hour.

=== Undocumented farm workers ===
In 2021 there were estimated 60,000 to 100,000 undocumented migrant workers labouring in the Australian agricultural industry. Poorly regulated migration agents entice many of these people to Australia on invalid visas and then in conjunction with farmers, force them to work off their debts in regional agricultural districts. Some are paid only around $30 a day for back-breaking work, forced to rent substandard housing, have poor access to health care, and are subject to abuse and sexual harassment. This exploitative labour system is openly acknowledged to be propping up many aspects of the Australian farm sector, and there appears to be little desire to implement any meaningful government regulation.

<doc id="1116274" wikidata="Q3461904" url="?curid=1116274" title="St. Boniface (provincial electoral district)">
<text>St. Boniface () is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It should not be confused with the federal electoral division of the same name, which includes most of the provincial riding&#x27;s territory but has expanded boundaries and a larger population base. The riding has existed, in one form or another, since the province&#x27;s creation.

In Manitoba&#x27;s first general election (1870), the riding was divided into St. Boniface East and St. Boniface West. It became a single constituency in 1874, and has existed continuously since then.

The St. Boniface constituency elected its representation by preferential balloting from 1926 to 1953, a single member by instant runoff voting from 1926 to 1945 and two members by single transferable voting in 1949 and 1953. On all other occasions, it has been a single-member constituency, electing its member by First Past The Post.

St. Boniface is located in the central-eastern Winnipeg. Its boundaries roughly correspond with the historical community of Saint Boniface, Manitoba, which was a distinct civic jurisdiction before being amalgamated with the City of Winnipeg in 1971.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,646. The average family income in 1999 was $45,193, with an unemployment rate of 10.5%. The service sector accounts for 18% of the riding&#x27;s industry, with a further 15% in health and social services.

St. Boniface has historically been home to the largest francophone community in the Winnipeg area. According to a 1999 census, 34% of the riding&#x27;s residents speak French as their first language—the highest rate in the province. The riding&#x27;s aboriginal population is 8%, and almost 19% of the population is over 65 years of age.

For many years after the introduction of partisan politics in 1882, St. Boniface was a hotly contested battleground riding between the provincial Liberals and Conservatives (although candidates of the parliamentary left were also elected in the 1930s and 1940s). During the 1950s and 1960s, it was generally regarded as a safe seat for the Liberals.

In 1969, St. Boniface MLA Laurent Desjardins decided to sit as a &quot;Liberal Democrat&quot;, supporting the New Democratic Party government of Edward Schreyer. He formally joined the NDP in 1971, and aside from an overturned election result in 1973, continued to represent the area until 1988.

The provincial Liberals recaptured the seat in 1988, during a period of resurgence for that party in the province. After Neil Gaudry&#x27;s death in 1999, Greg Selinger recaptured the seat for the NDP. He was reelected in 2003 with about 75 percent of the popular vote, and was named premier of Manitoba in 2009.

Selinger left politics two years after the NDP was heavily defeated at the 2016 provincial election, and newly elected Liberal leader Dougald Lamont won the seat at the ensuing by-election.

In the 2023 Manitoba general election, Lamont was defeated by the NDP and resigned as Liberal leader.

<doc id="1116275" wikidata="Q6789188" url="?curid=1116275" title="Matt Pickens">
<text>Matt Pickens (born April 5, 1982) is an American retired soccer player who is currently the goalkeeping coach for Nashville SC in Major League Soccer.

==Career==

===Youth and amateur===
Pickens initially attended Meramec Community College before playing college soccer for Missouri State University from 2000 to 2003. He also played for Chicago Fire Premier in the USL Premier Development League.

===Professional===

Upon graduating, Pickens was drafted 19th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the Fire. He was not able, however, to break through a deep lineup of Fire goalkeepers, which initially included Henry Ring and D.J. Countess, and later Zach Thornton. He was loaned out for much of the year to the A-League Virginia Beach Mariners, where he played 290 minutes, conceding only 3 goals.

During the latter half of 2006, after an injury to Zach Thornton, Pickens started in goal for the Fire even once Thornton was match fit again. Pickens won the 2006 Open Cup as the starter for Chicago Fire. Also in 2006, was his first MLS play-off start on October 22, 2006, for the Fire, keeping a clean sheet in a game that the Fire won, 1-0 thanks to a goal from Justin Mapp in the 35th minute. Zach Thornton was traded to the Colorado Rapids before the 2007 season, clearing the way for Pickens to start.

In February 2008, Pickens signed a deal with Queens Park Rangers until the end of the 2008 season.

In May 2008, it was announced that Pickens would not have his contract extended and that he would be released by the club at the end of June.

Pickens trained/trailed with numerous clubs in England and Scotland after his release, including Hibernian, Doncaster Rovers, Falkirk and Nottingham Forest, the latter of which he claims he was close to signing with. However, despite not securing a new contract in Europe, Chicago Fire traded Pickens rights to Colorado Rapids on January 15, 2009 and was signed by the club shortly after.

Pickens helped the Rapids to playoff appearances in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 the Rapids and Pickens won their first MLS Cup, beating FC Dallas 2–1 in extra time. Early in the 2013 season, Pickens suffered a broken arm in a match against Real Salt Lake making this his last appearance with the Rapids.

Pickens was released early in the 2014 season.

After Pickens was released by Colorado Rapids in early 2014 New England Revolution acquired him in the waiver draft.

Soon after signing with New England, Pickens was sold to Tampa Bay Rowdies in the North American Soccer League.

On November 30, 2017 Nashville SC announced Pickens as the club&#x27;s first signing ahead of their inaugural 2018 season in United Soccer League.

Nashville S.C. earned back to back playoff appearances in 2018 and 2019. Pickens was the USL Championship Goalkeeper of the year in 2019. Also in 2019, Pickens broke the 100 professional shutouts milestone in his career.

Other accomplishments for Pickens was being named MLS Player of the Month for September 2006 and October 2007, proving his ability to compete under pressure getting his team into the playoffs both years late in the MLS season.

==International==
As of December 2010, Pickens has been called up to five United States training camps, including the camp in January 2011. However, he has never earned a national cap or been part of the final 18-man roster.

==Coaching==
In January 2020, Pickens was announced as the first goalkeeping coach for Major League Soccer&#x27;s Nashville SC. Pickens departed Nashville in October 2024.

==Honors==

*U.S. Open Cup Champion: 2006

===Colorado Rapids===
*Major League Soccer Eastern Conference Championship: 2010
*Major League Soccer MLS Cup Champion: 2010

<text>Hang-Ups is the second studio album by American punk rock band Goldfinger, released by Mojo Records on September 9, 1997. Many of the album&#x27;s tracks feature more of a ska sound than their debut. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;This Lonely Place&quot; was not as successful as &quot;Here in Your Bedroom&quot;, a single off their debut album, but it did gain them numerous talk show appearances and spins of the video, which parodies the 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;.

Like their self-titled debut, the horns on the album are provided by several members of the Orange County ska scene, most notably Dan Regan and Scott Klopfenstein of Reel Big Fish on trombone and trumpet, respectively. The song &quot;Carlita&quot; features Angelo Moore of Fishbone on saxophone and vocals.

&quot;Superman&quot; was used in films &quot;Kingpin&quot; and &quot;Meet the Deedles&quot;. Two years after its release, the song gained further recognition thanks to the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; video game franchise when it first appeared in the first installment of the series, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; in addition to its 2012 and 2020 remakes. The song has become so strongly associated with the video game that it forms a core part of the recognisability of the series, with the 2020 documentary about the games, &quot;Pretending I&#x27;m a Superman: The Tony Hawk Video Game Story&quot;, being named from the song.

<text>G-Sale is a 2003 mockumentary film about garage sales and the people who are obsessed by them. The film is reminiscent of the movies of Christopher Guest and won several film festival awards.
==Plot==
Bogwood, Washington is a pleasant suburban community with a special distinction—it has more garages per capita than any other town in America. Not surprisingly, Bogwood is also the &quot;Garage Sale Capital of the U.S.A.&quot;

When retirees Doris &amp; Clayton Fenwick decide to empty their nest of retro-modern antiques, they set the wheels in motion for a frantically funny &quot;g-sale&quot; involving Bogwood&#x27;s most avid garage sale junkies: Angela Cocci (an obsessive market researcher), Ed LaSalle (a beleaguered computer programmer and creator of the cult fantasy roleplaying game &quot;Caves &amp; Beasts&quot;), Dick Nickerson (a retired star of the 60s sitcom &quot;Pot o&#x27; Gold&quot;), and BJ Harwood &amp; Helen Ziegler (partners and owners of a trendy retro-modern antique store).

These colorful characters try to outmaneuver each other to score their ultimate garage sale treasure: an antique board game worth a fortune.

==Location==
Bogwood was filmed on location in Seattle, Bellevue, and Bainbridge Island, Washington.

<doc id="1116301" wikidata="Q35315" url="?curid=1116301" title="Ghomara language">
<text>The Ghomara language is a Northern Berber language spoken in Morocco. It is the mother tongue of the Ghomara Berbers, who total around 10,000 people. Ghomara Berber is spoken on the western edge of the Rif, among the Beni Bu Zra and Beni Mansur tribes of the Ghomara confederacy. Despite being listed as endangered, it is still being passed on to children in these areas.

Ghomara Berber is relatively similar to Senhadja de Srair Berber spoken around Ketama. However, it is difficult to understand for a speaker of Rifian.

Some typical features that distinguish the Ghomara variety of Berber from Rifian Berber are the use of the preposition &quot;dar&quot; instead of the Rifian &quot;ghar&quot;, the feminine plural ending &quot;-an&quot; instead of &quot;-in&quot;, and the absence of spirantisation in word-initial position.

==Current status==
Although elderly Ghomara teach children how to speak Ghomara Berber at home, the language is still considered threatened, with only 10,000 known speakers. A major reason can be attributed to the small geographical location where this language is used, as well as the more common usage of Moroccan Arabic throughout Morocco.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Like Arabic, Ghomara and the other Berber dialects have three vowels: a-, i-, u-.

=== Consonants ===
Ghomara has 44 consonants, and most consonants in Ghomara have geminated forms.

==Grammar==
===Nouns===
For nouns in Ghomara Berber, there are several common trends. The prefix a-, i-, or u- commonly identifies the masculine singular nouns in the language (i.e., &quot;arg&#x27;az&quot; “man”). For feminine singular nouns, there is both a prefix and a suffix such as ta-...-t (i.e., &quot;tarbat&quot; “girl”). This is the most common way to identify feminine singular nouns. Masculine plural nouns are characterized by i-...-en or i-...-an (i.e., &quot;irg&#x27;azen&quot; “men”). For feminine plural nouns, ti-...-an (i.e., &quot;tirbatan&quot; “girls”) is the most common circumfix.

===Pronouns===
Ghomara Berber uses personal, singular, and plural pronouns.

The first person singular pronoun &quot;nekkin&quot; is equivalent to &quot;I&quot; in English. The second person singular male pronoun &quot;kedžin&quot; and female pronoun &quot;kemmin&quot; is equivalent to &quot;you&quot; in English. Similarly, in Ghomara Berber, the third person singular male pronoun &quot;netta&quot; and female pronoun &quot;nettaθa&quot; is equivalent to him or her in English respectively.

The first person plural pronoun &quot;nuçna&quot; is equivalent to &quot;we&quot; in English and the second person plural pronoun &quot;kunna&quot; is equivalent to &quot;you all&quot; in English. Lastly, &quot;niçma&quot; is the third person plural pronoun equivalent to &quot;they&quot; in English, and is not distinguished by gender.

===Verbs===
In Ghomara Berber verbs contain certain affixes that characterize singularity, plurality, and point of view (POV). The following is an example of the verb conjugations for the English word &quot;to write&quot; or &quot;ara&quot; in Ghomara Berber:

===Adjectives===
Adjectives have either suffix -ø, which characterizes masculine singular nouns or -θ, which characterizes both feminine singular and all plural nouns. For example:
*Masculine singular: &quot;tayfur mellulø&quot; “the, a white table”
*Feminine singular: &quot;tamɣart mezziθ&quot; “the, a little woman”
*Masculine plural: &quot;irgazen muqqreθ&quot; “(the) big men”
*Feminine plural: &quot;timettutan muqqreθ&quot; “(the) big women”

==Vocabulary==
An example of common English words in Ghomara Berber:
*&quot;targat&quot;: “dream”
*&quot;ahlan&quot;: “welcome, hello” (borrowed from Arabic)
*&quot;hemmam&quot;: “bathroom” (borrowed from Arabic)
*&quot;tamuda&quot;: “pig&quot;
*&quot;lmakla&quot;: “food” (borrowed from Arabic)
*&quot;tanebdut&quot;: “summer”
*&quot;kama&quot;: “bed” (borrowed from Spanish)

==Numbers==
Ghomara Berber uses a numerical system similar to many other languages. Cardinal numbers &quot;yan&quot; (“one”, masculine) and &quot;yat&quot; (“one”, feminine) are the only Berber numerals in Ghomara, while all the other cardinal numbers are borrowed from Moroccan Arabic (&quot;zuž&quot; (“two”), &quot;tlata&quot; (“three”), &quot;ɛišrin &quot; (“twenty”), &quot;tlatin&quot; (“thirty”), etc.).

<doc id="1116305" wikidata="Q260807" url="?curid=1116305" title="Colgan Air">
<text>Colgan Air was a regional airline in the United States that operated from 1965 until 2012, when it became a subsidiary of Pinnacle Airlines Corp. The initial headquarters of Colgan Air was in Manassas, Virginia until 2010, and then Memphis, Tennessee until closure in 2012.

Colgan Air operated for Continental Express/United Express, and US Airways Express. Pinnacle Airlines Corporation phased out the Colgan Air name on September 5, 2012, and transferred personnel and logistics to Pinnacle Airlines.

== History ==

Charles J. Colgan founded fixed-base operator Colgan Airways Corporation at Manassas Airport in 1965. It began scheduled service under contract with IBM in 1970 between Manassas, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., and Dutchess County Airport near Poughkeepsie, New York. In 1986 Colgan Air received its first airline contract with New York Air operating as New York Air Connection with Beechcraft Model 99s, Beechcraft 1900Cs, and Short 330s. New York Air was merged into Continental Airlines on February 1, 1987, at which time Colgan became a Continental Express feeder carrier. Jetstream 31 aircraft were then acquired. In 1986 and 1987 Colgan also code-shared with Pan Am as a Pan Am Partner on the Washington Dulles to Norfolk route. Colgan later sold to Presidential Airways which was also a Continental Express operator. In mid 1988 Colgan and Presidential switched from a Continental Express feeder to become a United Express feeder carrier. This operation under the United Airlines banner also only lasted about one year before Presidential shut down in 1989. 

After Presidential went defunct, Colgan and his son, Michael J., restarted service under the name National Capital on a Washington-Dulles to Binghamton, NY, route on December 1, 1991. Service was provided with Beechcraft 1900C equipment. .This route was later dropped and the name Colgan Air adopted. On July 1, 1997 Colgan became a feeder for Continental Airlines once again, this time operating under the name Continental Connection.

On December 11, 1999, Colgan left the Continental system and became exclusively a US Airways Express carrier, focusing its routes around major US Airways stations such as LaGuardia, Pittsburgh, and Boston. However, in 2005 Colgan acquired additional Saab 340 aircraft and resumed service as Continental Connection out of Houston.

Early on the morning of September 11, 2001, the day of the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda hijackers Mohammed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari flew on Colgan Air Flight 5930 from Portland International Jetport in Portland, Maine to Boston Logan Airport in Boston, where they boarded American Airlines Flight 11.

On October 4, 2005, Colgan Air started providing flights for United Express flights out of Washington&#x27;s Dulles International Airport. Initially serving Charleston, West Virginia, and Westchester County Airport in White Plains, New York, Colgan expanded its United Express service to include State College, Pennsylvania; Charlottesville, Virginia; Allentown, Pennsylvania; and Binghamton, New York.

Colgan Air was acquired by Pinnacle Airlines Corporation on January 18, 2007, for US$20 million. Under the terms of the purchase, Colgan&#x27;s regional aircraft fleet continued to operate independently of Pinnacle Airlines Corporation&#x27;s major subsidiary, Pinnacle Airlines, whose all regional jet fleet continued to fly and operate in the livery of Northwest Airlink. It was a strategic move by Pinnacle to get access to Colgan’s partners, Continental Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways.

Colgan Air began providing service out of Newark Liberty International Airport (as Continental Connection) starting in early 2008.

Colgan&#x27;s headquarters moved from Manassas, VA, to Pinnacle&#x27;s headquarters in Memphis, TN, in December 2009.

In July 2010, Pinnacle Airlines Corporation announced that the Colgan Air name would be phased out and all Pinnacle Airlines Corporation propeller flights would be operated by Mesaba Airlines. Colgan operated for two more years before winding down operations in 2012.

On May 15, 2012, Colgan Air ceased flying for US Airways Express. On June 5, 2012, flying in and out of the Houston (IAH) hub for United Express ceased. Colgan had previously operated as Continental Connection from IAH with Saab 340 aircraft prior to Continental-United merger. On July 31, Colgan Air phased out operations to Saab 340 fleet.

The last revenue flight, Colgan Air doing business as United Express Flight 3923 from Washington-Dulles to Albany, NY, was on September 5, 2012.

The remaining Bombardier Q400s on order were delivered to Republic Airways. Republic then phased out the Q400s between September 2014 and September 2016.

On January 3, 2017, the airline’s founder, Charles J. Colgan, died at the age of 90.

==Fleet==

All aircraft were operated under Colgan Air&#x27;s operating certificate.

Q400 aircraft were scheduled for interior configuration changes to install first class.
Saab 340 aircraft are also operated.

== Headquarters ==
The headquarters of Colgan Air were, at the end of the airline&#x27;s life, located in Memphis, Tennessee. The headquarters were formerly on the grounds of the Manassas Regional Airport in Manassas, Virginia. On Tuesday June 28, 2005, the Prince William County, Virginia, Board of County Supervisors voted to sell of land in the Innovation@Prince William business park in Prince William County to Colgan. Colgan Air planned to build a corporate headquarters and training facility in the business park for $1.7 million (including equipment costs) and move its headquarters from its airport site. Colgan planned to move its administrative and training employees from the headquarters site and other sites in Manassas and Prince William County to the new complex. The company also planned to hire around 90 additional employees as part of the process.

After Pinnacle Airlines Corp. bought Colgan Air in 2007 and made Colgan Air its subsidiary, Pinnacle agreed to keep Colgan&#x27;s headquarters in Manassas as long as, in the company&#x27;s words, &quot;it continues to make operational and financial sense for the organization.&quot; In 2009, Colgan Air announced that it was moving its headquarters to Memphis to be in proximity to the offices of Pinnacle Airlines, Colgan Air&#x27;s parent company. 50 employees were scheduled to transfer to Memphis to work in crew scheduling, dispatch, training, flight operations, and other administrative tasks. While 45 other employees were asked to move to Memphis, they declined so they could stay in the Manassas area. In September 2009, the human resources department was scheduled to stay in Manassas. In October 2009, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. tried to get additional incentives from the State of Tennessee as the Colgan headquarters were about to move. During that month, Colgan announced that 20 employees would remain in Manassas to man the two hangars at Manassas Regional Airport. 100 jobs in Manassas were lost as part of the headquarters move. Helaine Becker, a transportation analyst employed by Jesup &amp; Lamont Securities Corp, believes that the moving of Colgan will help reduce costs; she said that the company did not need two corporate headquarters and that &quot;I think it has more to do with that than anything else.&quot;

In 2010, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. considered moving its headquarters to Downtown Memphis and to Olive Branch, Mississippi, and the airline also considered keeping the headquarters in its current location. Pinnacle selected Downtown Memphis, and on October 8, 2010, the airline held a celebration for its decision to move into One Commerce Square in Downtown Memphis. The Center City Commission, the City of Memphis, and Shelby County gave out $10 million in incentives, including free parking, to convince Pinnacle to move to Downtown Memphis.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* August 26, 2003: Flight 9446, a Beechcraft 1900D (registered N240CJ) operated for US Airways Express as a non-revenue &quot;ferry flight&quot; hit the water off the coast of Yarmouth, Massachusetts, shortly after taking off from Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis, MA. Both pilots died in the crash.
* February 12, 2009: Flight 3407, a Bombardier Q400 (registered N200WQ) operated for Continental Connection crashed into a house located at 6038 Long Street in Clarence Center, New York, while on approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport, resulting in 50 deaths. The NTSB report states that pilot error, in particular a non-standard response to stick-shaker system, was the cause of the crash. Secondary causes included pilot fatigue.
* September 7, 2011: Flight 3222, a Saab 340B (registered N352CJ) operated for Continental Connection with 23 passengers en route from Houston, TX, to Lake Charles Regional Airport in Lake Charles, Louisiana, landed at nearby Southland Field in Carlyss, which was a similarly oriented airport located southwest of the intended destination.

<doc id="1116319" wikidata="Q918046" url="?curid=1116319" title="Britannia Airways">
<text>Britannia Airways was a charter airline based in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1961 as Euravia and became the world&#x27;s largest holiday airline. Britannia&#x27;s main bases were at London Gatwick, London Stansted, London Luton, Cardiff, Bristol, East Midlands, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds Bradford, Liverpool, and Glasgow. It had its headquarters at Britannia House in Luton.

Britannia was originally a charter operator for Universal Sky Tours and later for Thomson holidays where it became the in-house airline with a fleet of Boeing jet aircraft.

In 2000, Thomson Travel Group, and thereby Britannia Airways, were acquired by TUI Group of Germany. As part of a wider reorganisation of TUI&#x27;s UK operations in September 2004, Britannia was rebranded as Thomsonfly.

==History==
===Origins===
The airline was established as &quot;Euravia (London)&quot; by British businessman T.E.D. Langton and aviation consultant J.E.D. Williams on 1 December 1961. It was founded at a time of considerable turmoil for the independent sector of the British air operators industry, during the early 1960s, several firms suffered from severe financial hardship and were even driven into bankruptcy. Upon deciding to launch operations, the company quickly obtained the necessary licences from the Air Transport Licensing Board, airworthiness certificates for its aircraft from the Air Registration Board, and an Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate from the Ministry of Aviation. These applications were not without some difficulty as Euravia had the distinction of being refused more licences than any other two airlines put together; this was due to the fact that the firm placed a larger number of applications than any British airline, except for British United Airways (BUA).

On 1 April 1962, Euravia established its initial operating base at Luton Airport; on 13 April, the airline&#x27;s first aircraft, a Lockheed Constellation, was delivered for certification and training. Early on, Euravia benefitted from its close association with inclusive tour holiday company Universal Sky Tours. On 5 May 1962, Euravia commenced flight operations, using an initial batch of three Constellations to perform flights on behalf of Universal Sky Tours. Within ten days, the operation was reportedly breaking-even; by a month later, the firm&#x27;s initial fleet was operating at its maximum planned utilisation rate.

On 5 October of that same year, a rival charter airline Skyways, one of Britain&#x27;s foremost independent airlines during the 1950s and early 1960s, was taken over by Euravia and integrated into its operations. The Skyways takeover did not include Skyways Coach-Air Limited, a Skyways associate, established in the early 1950s by Eric Rylands to operate low-fare coach-air services between London and several European capital cities. Following Euravia&#x27;s acquisition of Skyways, Skyways Coach-Air remained independent until its successor Skyways International was taken over by Dan-Air in 1972.

By 15 June 1963, Euravia was operating a mixed fleet of eight Constellations and four Avro Yorks. Euravia also took on Skyways Pan Am engine contract at London Heathrow using ex-Skyways Yorks; under this arrangement, one of these aircraft was on permanent standby at Heathrow ready to fly a spare jet engine to rescue any PanAm Boeing 707 jetliner that encountered engine problems. These rescue flights were flown as far afield as Singapore and Hong Kong. The other Yorks were used for ad hoc freighting until 1965 when the last aircraft G-AGNV was flown from Luton to Staverton, Gloucester to be an exhibit at the now defunct Skyfame museum. Upon retirement, this aircraft was preserved and placed on display at the RAF Museum Midlands, Cosford.

===Rebranding===

On 16 August 1964, the airline was rebranded, becoming &quot;Britannia Airways&quot;; this name was adopted to coincide with re-equipping with ex-British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Bristol Britannia turboprop airliners to replace the Constellations. The type would not be used for long however; during December 1970, the last remaining Britannia 102 was withdrawn from service, consequently, the airline became an all-jet operator at this point. During the late 1960s, Britannia became the first charter airline to offer assigned seating, as well as hot in-flight meals.

During the mid-1960s, Britannia had attracted the interest of the newspaper business magnate Lord Thomson, who sought a good prospect with which to diversify his business stakes; Thomson also approved of the company&#x27;s activities being beneficial to the general public. As a result of this interest, during 1965, Britannia became part of Thomson, itself part of the Canadian-owned International Thomson Organisation. This acquisition was beneficial to the company&#x27;s prospects, including financing the acquisition of a new generation of jet-powered airliners to enable Britannia&#x27;s rapid transition into the jet age.

During 1968, Britannia commenced a re-equipment effort involving the then-new Boeing 737-200 jetliner; it had the distinction of being the first European airline to operate the type. The purchase of the brand new and relatively unproved 737 was seen as a major breach of traditional practice; historically, charter airliners procured secondhand aircraft from their larger scheduled airlines. In addition, the large &#x27;flag carriers&#x27; were comparatively wary of the value of jet-powered aircraft, normally opting for comfort and high-quality passenger conditions over speeds. This unconventional purchase was also politically controversial; Sir George Edwards, the chairman of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), had expected Britannia to order the rival BAC One-Eleven and lobbied government officials to convince the airline to procure the British airliner instead. These pressure tactics ultimately proved to be unsuccessful; by 1975, Britannia was operating a fleet of 13 Boeing 737s.

By 1972, the airline had become the largest of the British independent charter airlines. Prior to the mid-1970s, Britannia, much like other British charter airlines of the era, had concentrated upon low-cost flights to Spain and the use of provincial airports (other than its Luton base) to provide its services. However, the company held ambitions to expand beyond this. During 1988, Britannia&#x27;s 767s were used to commence regular charter flights between Britain and Australia, as well as to New Zealand the following year. Between 1968 and 1984, Britannia carried nearly 42 million passengers, while the company&#x27;s fleet grew to include twenty-nine Boeing 737s and a pair of 767s.

Britannia also became the first European airline to fly the Boeing 767, which was added to its fleet in the 1980s; the 767 was the first widebodied aircraft to enter service in the company&#x27;s fleet and enabled Britannia to become the first British holiday airline to offer passengers free in-flight audio and video entertainment.

During August 1988, Britannia&#x27;s immediate parent company, the Thomson Travel Group, purchased Horizon Travel and its airline, Orion Airways, which was then integrated into Britannia.

===Later service===
During the 1990s, Britannia also began to operate services for Skytours and Portland Direct, themselves also part of the Thomson Group. During this time, Britannia heavily modernised its fleet and expanded its route network to holiday destinations in Asia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. During 1997, 34 per cent of Britannia&#x27;s flights were flown to long-haul destinations. By the summer of 1998, Britannia&#x27;s operations, which were by then centered around Germany, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, operated a mixed fleet of three Airbus A320s, a single Boeing 737-800, 24 757s and 13 767s.

Several efforts were made at European expansion during this time. During 1997, Britannia formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Britannia GmbH, based in Germany to operate long and short-haul flights from airports in Germany, Switzerland and Austria for German tour operators, flying several 767-300s. On 3 November 1997, the subsidiary&#x27;s inaugural flight was flown, flying between Berlin and the Dominican Republic. At one point, Britannia Airways GmbH employed roughly 200 people and operated 4 Boeing 767-300s; however, this division was successful( more than 1 million passengers per year) but closed down during March 2001 due to the TUI acquisition.
During early 1998, the Thomson Travel Group also acquired the Scandinavian holiday operation, Fritidsresor Group, along with its airline Blue Scandinavia, which was later renamed Britannia Nordic (since rebranded as TUI fly Nordic).

In addition, it was during this decade that Britannia launched several public image and service quality initiatives, such as the &quot;flying with confidence&quot; course and closer customer service coordination within Thomson. During the early 1990s, the airline launched its in-flight &quot;Royal Service&quot; brand to increase the profile of the company&#x27;s high-end services, somewhat akin to the premium service levels available on scheduled airlines. It was succeeded by a newer brand, &quot;360&quot;, during the late 1990s; this service was billed as being less old-fashioned and possessed greater personality.

During 2000, Thomson Travel Group, and thereby Britannia Airways, were acquired by TUI Group of Germany. As part of a wider reorganisation of TUI&#x27;s UK operations in September 2004, it was announced that Britannia would be rebranded as Thomsonfly.

== Fleet ==
The Britannia Airways fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

The Airline also operated Bristol Britannia aircraft and Boeing 707s. 

== Competitors ==
At the time of rebranding, Britannia was the largest charter airline in the United Kingdom, its position of market dominance being owed to the growth of Thomson Holidays. Initially its main competitor was British Airtours. The 1980s saw the growth of Monarch Airlines as a credible competitor. In the 1990s Air 2000, Airtours International, First Choice Airways and Flying Colours Airlines grew as competitors. Its main competitor at the time of rebranding was Thomas Cook Airlines.

== Incidents and accidents ==
Britannia Airways suffered two accidents whilst operating under that name (1961–2005):
* On 1 September 1966, Britannia Airways Flight 105, a Bristol 175 Britannia, crashed into high ground on the approach to landing at Ljubljana, Slovenia due to pilot error after a flight from Luton, England. Of the 117 onboard 98 died.
* On 14 September 1999, Britannia Airways Flight 226A, a Boeing 757-204, crashed on its second attempt at landing in heavy rain and poor weather conditions. Of the 236 passengers and 9 crew on board, two were seriously injured and 41 sustained minor injuries. One of the passengers who had apparently sustained only minor injuries died five days later of suspected internal injuries. The flight was an international charter between Cardiff, Wales and Girona Airport, Spain.

<doc id="1116326" wikidata="Q7899800" url="?curid=1116326" title="Uravan, Colorado">
<text>Uravan (a contraction of uranium/vanadium) is a former uranium mining town in western Montrose County, Colorado, United States, which still appears on some maps. The town was a company town established by U. S. Vanadium Corporation in 1936 to extract the rich vanadium ore in the region. As a byproduct of vanadium extraction, small amounts of uranium were also produced, at the time mostly used as a yellow pigment for ceramics.

The town was located approximately south-southwest of Grand Junction along the San Miguel River. At one time, over 800 people lived in Uravan, and the town housed a school, a trading center (store), medical facilities, tennis courts, a recreation center, and a pool. The school and some other facilities remained operational until at least 1983; however, Uravan was shut down by mid-1985, and no traces of its former buildings remain. Uravan is now an uninhabited, undeveloped Superfund site.

==Prehistory==
There are several prehistoric sites near Uravan on the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties:
* Dolores Cave was inhabited from about 600 BC to AD 1400. A corn cob dated about AD 1500 was found in the site, which indicates that corn was grown in the area after the Ancient Pueblo People (Anasazi) abandoned their Colorado pueblos in the 13th century.
* Tabeguache Cave II is a large prehistoric rock shelter occupied from about AD 600 - 1500. There is also a Tabeguache Cave and two other rock shelters near Nucla, Colorado.

==History==
===Gold===
In 1885, placer gold was discovered in a tributary of the San Miguel River, Mesa Creek, nine miles from Nucla, Colorado. The Montrose Placer Mining Company constructed the Hanging Flume on the east wall of Dolores River Canyon.

===20th century uranium mining===
During World War II, Uravan provided part of the uranium needed by the Manhattan Project for the first atomic bomb. Because of wartime secrecy the Manhattan Project would only publicly admit to purchasing the vanadium, and did not pay the uranium miners for the uranium ore (in a much later lawsuit, many miners were able to reclaim lost profits from the U.S. government).

In the beginning of the Cold War, to ensure adequate supplies of uranium for national defense, the United States Congress passed the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1946, creating the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) which had the power to withdraw prospective uranium mining land from public purchase, and also to manipulate the price of uranium to meet national needs. By setting a high price for uranium ore, the AEC created a uranium &quot;boom&quot; in the early 1950s, which attracted many prospectors to the Four Corners region of the country. Uravan&#x27;s fortunes grew as it became one of the major &quot;yellowcake boomtowns&quot; in the region.

American military requirements of uranium declined in the 1960s, and the government completed its uranium procurement program by the end of 1970. Simultaneously, a new market emerged: commercial nuclear power plants. However, the U.S. domestic uranium mining industry collapsed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, due to lack of new nuclear power plants, and to low-price uranium imported from Canada.

The town had been in decline for several years; the decision was made to close Uravan in 1985 and commence a large-scale clean-up of the entire site. Environmental cleanup of the site commenced in 1986 and was completed in 2008. All the buildings have been removed and the site regraded and replanted, about 800 inhabitants had to move. All that remains is a turnoff and interpretive sign along State Highway 141. Former residents of Uravan raised funds to preserve a boarding house and recreation center on the old town site, but Dow Chemical, which acquired Union Carbide, the owner of the Uravan mill, in 1999, burned them down in 2007 due to fears of radiative contamination.

== Future ==
On May 6, 2012, the Montrose County Board of County Commissioners signed the Omnibus Agreement with Dow Chemical, giving them three tracts of land: Ballpark Parcel #1, a plot between Hwy. 141 and the San Miguel River; Ballpark Parcel #2, approximately northwest of the first parcel; and the townsite property, located between County Roads EE22 and Y11.

Montrose County agreed to accept this property on behalf of the Rimrocker Historical Society of Western Montrose County, which has worked since 1990 to preserve and interpret the history of Uravan. The Rimrocker Historical Society and Montrose County entered into a long-term lease on May 1, 2013 for a section of Ballpark parcel #1, with the intention of building a museum and campground on the property.
The Rimrocker Historical Society of Western Montrose County hosts the annual Uranium History Celebration and Reunion Picnic at Historic Uravan, Colorado every August. Over 1,000 people attended the 100th anniversary of the original Joe Jr. Mill in 2012.

<doc id="1116335" wikidata="Q1054445" url="?curid=1116335" title="Bundanoon, New South Wales">
<text>Bundanoon is a town in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia, in Wingecarribee Shire, on Gandangarra and Dharawal Country (where these two countries meet). It is an Aboriginal name meaning &quot;place of deep gullies&quot; and was formerly known as &quot;Jordan&#x27;s Crossing&quot;.
Bundanoon is colloquially known as &quot;Bundy/Bundi&quot;.

Bundanoon, like its fellow Southern Villages of the Southern Highlands, has had a boom-and-bust economic cycle. The town became a well-known tourist destination early in the 20th century; its picturesqueness and the scenery of what is now Morton National Park, combined with being served by the railway network, made it a pleasant and convenient holiday area for city dwellers who could not afford more expensive accommodations at the popular Blue Mountains resort area. By the 1950s, however, changes in lifestyle, particularly the affordability of the motor car, gave city dwellers more options and Bundanoon declined.

The Sydney real estate boom of the early 21st century made Bundanoon an affordable haven within commuting distance of the city. Property values increased several-fold, and houses in Bundanoon were selling for over a million dollars by 2007.

Several houses in the town were destroyed by a bushfire in January 2020.

==Population==
At the 2021 census there were 2,869 people residing in Bundanoon.

The recorded 2,729 people living in Bundanoon. The town&#x27;s population was significantly older than the general population: their median age was 56 years, 18 years older than the national median age of 38. Children aged under 15 made up 13.8% of the population (fewer than the national average of 18.7%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 36.0% of the population (more than double the national average of 15.8%). This is reflected in the low workforce participation, with only 1,078 of the 2,729 people reporting themselves as being in the labour force. Of these, 49.6% were employed full-time, 41.7% were employed part-time and 4.2% were unemployed. 76.6% of people living in Bundanoon were born in Australia; the next most common countries of birth were England 8.7%, New Zealand 1.4%, and Germany 1.1%. 92.5% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.4%, Anglican 27.4% and Catholic 18.7%.

==Annual events==
* Brigadoon Highland Gathering – every April (established 1977) – attracts Scottish participants and tourists from around the world.
* Garden Ramble – every October (established 1996)
* Bundanoon hosts the Sydney Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera every spring over 1 weekend. Performances are a sellout at the Soldiers&#x27; Memorial Hall and are a much loved annual event.

==Churches==
Anglican: Part of the Sutton Forest parish.
In 1879, Holy Trinity Anglican church was built on its present site. (The timber church was destroyed by bushfire in December 1904; rebuilt in stone in 1905.)

Catholic: Part of the parish of St Paul&#x27;s in Moss Vale.
St Brigid&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in 1895. Prior to that, Roman Catholic services were conducted at Sutton Forest.

Uniting: Part of the Moss Vale–Bundanoon–Robertson parish.
By 1870 the Primitive Methodist Church was established on the corner where the Soldiers&#x27; Memorial Hall now stands. The Primitive Methodists moved to a new building in 1885 (now the Uniting Church) and leased the original site to shop owners.

==Other places of worship==
Theravada Buddhist: Santi Forest Monastery is at 100 Coalmines Rd, Bundanoon. Santi Forest vihara is a Buddhist Nuns&#x27; hermitage meditation and contemplative monastery, a place of practice for Bhikkhunī nuns in the Theravada Forest tradition of Buddhism.

==School==
Bundanoon Public School was established in 1871. It had an enrolment of 190 students as at 2016, which had dropped to 160 in 2020.

The Primitive Methodist Church hall served as the first school, with Mrs Dinah Osborne as teacher. A new school of two rooms was built in 1880 and is still used as the school library.

==Transport==
Bundanoon railway station is located on the Southern Highlands line. Most services terminate at Moss Vale, meaning Bundanoon only receives limited services. Sydney to Canberra services also stop at the station.

Local bus services are provided by Berrima Bus Lines.

On the day of the , 4.1% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 65.3% by car (either as driver or as passenger).

==Sport==
*Football – Bundanoon Rebels Football Club (est 1991) enters junior and senior teams in the local Highlands competition. Soccer is the main winter sport played with 5 acres of fields provided at Ferndale Reserve.
*Cricket – Bundanoon Cricket Club enters junior cricket teams for boys and girls, and senior cricket teams, in the HDCA competition.
*Rolloff World Championships are held in Bundanoon.

==Heritage listings==
Bundanoon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Main Southern railway: Bundanoon railway station

== History ==
The town was originally named Jordan&#x27;s Crossing. The change of name for post office was gazetted in April 1881, although it had been reported as &quot;Bundanoon township at Jordan&#x27;s Crossing&quot; when a meeting was held in 1870 to establish the public school.

=== Bundanoon History Group ===
Established in the early 1980s, the Bundanoon History Group meets once a month in The Old Goods Shed, where its collection of photographs and written records are held.

===Ban on bottled water===
In July 2009 &quot;Bundy on Tap&quot;, a community initiative in Bundanoon, declared itself opposed to the sale of bottled drinking water on environmental grounds; local businesses instead committed themselves to filling re-usable bottles with tap water on request. The issue of bottled water was to protest against companies Norlex and Coca-Cola (that owns Australian bottled water brands Neverfail and Mount Franklin) extracting water from the town&#x27;s groundwater.

=== 2020 Bushfire ===
In January 2020, the town was affected by a bushfire during the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season. Several homes were destroyed.

* David Foster (born 1944) novelist
* Margaret Jeffrey (1896–1977) senior policewoman

<doc id="1116337" wikidata="Q34174" url="?curid=1116337" title="Tarifit">
<text>Tarifit, also known as Riffian or locally as Tamazight (, ; ) is a Zenati Berber language spoken in the Rif region in northern Morocco. It is spoken natively by some 1,200,000 Rifians, comprising 3.2% of the population, primarily in the Rif provinces of Nador, Al Hoceima and Driouch.

== Name ==
In the Rif, the native name of this language is &#x27;Tmaziɣt&#x27; (pronounced Tmazixt in most dialects). Speakers may specify by calling it &#x27;Tarifiyt&#x27; (pronounced Tarifect in central dialects).

== Classification ==

Riffian is a Zenati Berber language which consists of various sub-dialects specific to each clan and of which a majority are spoken in the Rif region, a large mountainous area of Northern Morocco, and a minority spoken in the western part of neighbouring Algeria.

== Geographic distribution ==

Riffian is spoken mainly in the Moroccan Rif on the Mediterranean coast and in the Rif mountains, with a large minority in the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla. There are also speakers of Riffian in Morocco outside the Rif region, notably in the rest of Moroccan cities where they compose a minority. The neighbour state of Algeria is also home to Rif minorities. A Riffian-speaking community exists in the Netherlands and Belgium as well as to a lesser extent other European countries.

=== Morocco ===
There is a large amount of dialectal variation in Riffian Berber; this can easily be seen using the dialect Atlas (Lafkioui, 1997), however Riffian compose a single language with its own phonetical innovations distinct from other Berber languages. Majority of them are spoken in Northern Morocco, this includes the varieties of Al Hoceima, Temsamane, Nador, Ikbadene (including Iznasen) and the more southernly variety in the Taza province. Besides Riffian, two other related and smaller Berber languages are spoken in North Morocco: the Sanhaja de Srair and the Ghomara languages. They are only distantly related to Riffian and are not mutually intelligible with it.

=== Algeria ===

A few Riffian dialects are or used to be in the western part of Algeria, notably by the Beni Snouss tribe of the Tlemcen, as well in Bethioua but also in various colonial districts Riffians started to emigrate to since the 19th century.

== Dialects ==
There is no consensus on what varieties are considered Riffian and not, the difference of opinion mainly lie in the easternmost dialects of the Znassia and the westernmost dialects of Senhaja de Sraïr and Ketama. Dialects include West-Riffian (Al Hoceima), Central-Riffian (Nador) and East-Riffian (Berkane). Iznasen (Beni Znassen) is counted as a dialect in Kossman (1999), but Blench (2006) classifies it as one of the closely related Mzab–Wargla languages.

Lafkioui (2020) argues that the Berber varieties of the Rif area (North, Northwest, and Northeast Morocco), – including the varieties of the Senhaja (westernmost group) and of the Iznasen (easternmost group) – form a language continuum with 5 stable core aggregates:
*Western Rif Berber: cities such as Ketama, Targuist and Taghzout.
*West-Central Rif Berber: cities such as Al Hoceima, Bni Hadifa, Imzouren.
*Central Rif Berber: cities such as Nador, Midar and Kassita.
*East-Central Rif Berber: cities such as Al Aaroui, Driouch and Ain Zohra.
*Eastern Rif Berber: cities such as Berkane and Ras Kebdana.

They cut across the traditionally used groupings of Senhaja, Rif, Iznasen which are in fact ethnonyms and hold no classification value of any kind, neither do they correspond to the sociolinguistic landscape of the Rif area, which shows considerable complexity.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
* A mid-central vowel /ə/ can occur in lax positions.
* Lax allophones of /i, a, u/ are heard as [ɪ, æ, ʊ].
* In the vicinity of pharyngealized consonants, /i, a, u/ are heard as [ɪˤ, ɑˤ, ʊˤ].
* Vowels lengthen in closed final syllables, e.g. tisit [θɪsɪˑθ] &#x27;mirror&#x27;.

==== Vocalized r ====

=== Consonants ===
All consonants except for /ŋ/, /tʃ/ and /ʔ/ have a geminate counterpart. Most of the time, a geminate is only different from its plain counterpart because of its length. Spirantized consonants have long stops as their geminate counterparts, e.g. yezḏeɣ &#x27;he lives&#x27; vs. izeddeɣ &#x27;he always lives&#x27;. There are only a few phonatactic expeceptions to this, e.g. in verb suffixes before vowel-initial clitics, ṯessfehmeḏḏ-as . A few consonants have divergent geminated counterparts; ḍ (/dˤ/ and /ðˤ/) to ṭṭ (/tˤː/), w (/w/) to kkʷ (/kːʷ/), ɣ (/ʁ/) to qq (/qː/), and ř (/r/) to ǧ (/dʒː/). There are some exceptions to this. This is most common with ww, e.g. acewwaf &#x27;hair&#x27;, and rarely occurs with ɣɣ and ḍḍ e.g. iɣɣed &#x27;ashes&#x27;, weḍḍaạ &#x27;to be lost&#x27;. /dʒ/ and /dʒː/ are allophonic realizations of the same phoneme, both are common.
Notes:
* /ʝ/ has become /j/ in most of Central Riffian e.g. ayenduz instead of aɡ̠enduz &#x27;calf&#x27;.
* /ç/ has mostly become /ʃ/ in Central Riffian and only occurs in a few words, e.g. seḵsu &#x27;couscous&#x27;.
* Pharyngealization is a spreading feature, it may spread to a whole word.
* The only pharyngealized consonants common in Berber roots are /dˤ/, /ðˤ/, /zˤ/ and /rˤ/; the others seem to mainly occur in words of Arabic and Spanish origin.
* /ʃˤ/ seems to only occur in the nouns ucca &#x27;greyhound&#x27; and mucc &#x27;cat&#x27;.
* /ŋ/ occurs exclusively before the consonant /w/, it may be an assimilatory variant of n.
* Labialization only occurs with the geminates /kːʷ/ and /gːʷ/.

==== Assimilations ====
There are quite a few assimilations that occur with the feminine suffixes t and ṯ.

:ḇ + ṯ = fṯ/ft (e.g. tajeǧeft &lt; tajeǧeḇṯ &#x27;gown/djellaba&#x27;)
:z + ṯ = sṯ/st (e.g. talwist &lt; talwizṯ &#x27;gold coin&#x27;)
:ẓ + ṯ = ṣṯ/ṣt (e.g. tayạạẓiṣt &lt; tayạạẓiẓṯ &#x27;hare&#x27;)
:j + ṯ = cṯ/ct (e.g. taɛejjact &lt; taɛejjajṯ &#x27;dust&#x27;)
:ɣ + ṯ = xṯ/xt (e.g. tmazixt &lt; tmaziɣt &#x27;Berber language&#x27;)
:ɛ + ṯ = ḥṯ/ḥt (e.g. tqubeḥt &lt; tqubeɛṯ &#x27;little bird&#x27;)

There are also other assimilations.

:ḏ + ṯ = tt (e.g. tabritt &lt; tabriḏṯ &#x27;path&#x27;)
:d + ṯ = tt (e.g. a t-tawi &lt; a d-ṯawi &#x27;she will bring here&#x27;)
:ḍ + ṯ = ṭṭ (e.g. tyaẓiṭṭ &lt; tyaẓiḍṯ &#x27;hen&#x27;)
:m + ṯ = nt (e.g. taxxant &lt; taxxamṯ &#x27;small room&#x27;)
:ř + ṯ = č (e.g. tameǧač &lt; tameǧařṯ &#x27;egg&#x27;)

Spirantized consonants become stops after the consonant &#x27;n&#x27;, this occurs between words as well.

:qqimen da &lt; qqimen ḏa &#x27;they sit here&#x27;
:tilifun tameqqṛant &lt; tilifun ṯameqqṛant &#x27;the big phone&#x27;

=== Sound shifts ===

====Zenati sound shifts====
The initial masculine &quot;a-&quot; prefix is dropped in certain words, e.g., afus &#x27;hand&#x27; becomes &quot;fus&quot;, and afiɣaṛ &#x27;snake&#x27; becomes &quot;fiɣạṛ&quot;. This change, characteristic of Zenati Berber varieties, distances Riffian from neighbouring dialects such as Atlas-Tamazight and Shilha.

==== L and ř ====
In the history of Western and Central Riffian /l/ has become /r/ in a lot of words. In most dialects there is no difference in this consonant (ř) and in original r, but in some dialects it is more clearly distinguished by the fact that ř is trilled while r is a tap. The difference becomes clearer when they are preceded by a vowel, because only original r has a heightening effect on the vowel preceding it e.g. aři [æɾɪ] vs ari [aɾɪ]. This sound shift has affected other consonants as well.

* in other dialects corresponds to &#x27;ř&#x27; (//) in Riffian (e.g. &quot;ul&quot; &gt; &quot;uř&quot; &#x27;heart&#x27;)
* The geminate equivalent, () in other dialects corresponds to &#x27;ǧ&#x27; (//) in Riffian (e.g. &quot;yelli&quot; &gt; &quot;yeǧi&quot; &#x27;my daughter&#x27;). It is underlyingly řř.
* in other dialects corresponds to &#x27;č&#x27; () in Riffian (e.g. &quot;weltma&quot; &gt; &quot;wečma&quot; &#x27;my sister&#x27;). It is underlyingly řt.

These sound shifts do not occur in the easternmost Riffian dialects of Icebdanen and Iznasen and the westernmost dialects.

==== R vocalization ====
Postvocalic preceding a consonantal coda is vocalized, as in taddart &gt; taddaat &#x27;house/home&#x27;. Thus in tamara &#x27;hard work/misery&#x27; the is conserved because it precedes a vowel. These sound shifts do not occur in the easternmost Riffian dialects of Icebdanen and Iznasen and the westernmost dialects beyond Ayt Waayaɣeř.

==Writing system==
Like other Berber languages, Riffian has been written with several different systems over the years. Unlike the nearby Tashelhit (Shilha), Riffian Berber has little written literature before the twentieth century. The first written examples of Riffian Berber start appearing just before the colonial period. Texts like R. Basset (1897) and S. Biarnay (1917) are transcribed in the Latin alphabet but they are transcribed in a rather deficient way. Most recently (since 2003), Tifinagh has become official throughout Morocco. The Arabic script is not used anymore for writing Riffian Berber. The Berber Latin alphabet continues to be the most used writing system online and in most publications in Morocco and abroad.

== Grammar ==
===Nouns===
Tarifiyt has two genders, masculine and feminine. In countable nouns with Berber affixes, gender is derivative: in principle, every masculine noun has a feminine counterpart. Gender derivation is relatively straightforward. The feminine is derived from 
the masculine form by adding an element /t-/ to the prefix, and a suffix /-t/, as in most Berber languages. With humans and higher animals, masculine and feminine mark natural gender, e.g.
:aḥenjia (M) &#x27;boy&#x27; → taḥenjiat (F) &#x27;girl&#x27;
:ayyaw (M) &#x27;grandson&#x27; → tayyawt (F) &#x27;granddaughter&#x27;
:asaadun (M) &#x27;male mule&#x27; → tasaadunt (F) &#x27;female mule&#x27;
:afunas (M) &#x27;ox&#x27; → tafunast (F) &#x27;cow&#x27;
For a few basic items there exist suppletive pairs, e.g. 
:aayaz (M) &#x27;man&#x27; → tamɣaat (F) &#x27;woman&#x27;
:amyan (M) &#x27;he-goat&#x27; → tɣaṭṭ (F) &#x27;she-goat&#x27;
:icarri (M) &#x27;ram&#x27; → tixsi (F) &#x27;ewe&#x27;
:yis (M) &#x27;hore&#x27; → řɛawda (F) &#x27;mare&#x27;

Tarifiyt countable nouns distinguish a singular from a plural. Masculine plurals generally take the prefix /i-/, feminines /ti-/, and take the suffix /-en/ in the masculine and /-in/ in the feminine, e.g.
:axxam (SG) &#x27;room&#x27; → ixxamen (PL) &#x27;rooms&#x27;
:tafunast (SG) &#x27;cow&#x27; → tifunasin (PL) &#x27;cows&#x27;
A few nouns have suppletive plurals: 
:uma (SG) &#x27;my brother&#x27; → ayetma (PL) &#x27;my brothers&#x27;
:učma (SG) &#x27;my sister&#x27; → issma (PL) &#x27;my sisters&#x27;

Nouns with Berber affixes distinguish two forms, which are related to the syntactic context and function of the noun, &quot;Free State&quot; and &quot;Annexed State&quot;. The Annexed State is used for subjects placed after the verb, after all prepositions except ař and břa, as a post­topic put in extraposition to the central clause and after a few pre­nominal elements. The Annexed State is formed as follows: in masculines, initial /a/ becomes /we/ and initial /i/ becomes /ye/. In feminines, initial /ta/ usually becomes /te/ and initial /ti/ also usually becomes /te/, e.g.
:asnus → wesnus &#x27;donkey foal (M)&#x27;
:tasnust → tesnust &#x27;donkey foal (F)&#x27;
:isnas → yesnas &#x27;donkey foals (M)&#x27;
:tisnas → tesnas &#x27;donkey foal (F)&#x27;

In the Annexed State of the masculine, the high vowels u and i are used instead of the semivowels w and y when the noun stem starts with a consonant followed by a vowel (including schwa). The feminine AS prefix does not have schwa under this condition. This has to do with the constraint on schwa in open syllables, e.g.
:afunas → ufunas &#x27;bull&#x27;
:tafunast → tfunast &#x27;cow&#x27;
:ifunasen → ifunasen &#x27;bulls&#x27;
:tifunasin → tfunasin &#x27;cows&#x27;

==Lexicon==
=== Basic vocabulary ===
=== Loanwords ===
Tarifit has loaned a fair amount of its vocabulary from Arabic, Spanish and French. Around 51.7% of the vocabulary of Tarifit is estimated to have been borrowed (56.1% of nouns and 44.1% of verbs). All loaned verbs follow Riffian conjugations, and some loaned nouns are Berberized as well. A lot of loans are not recognizable because of sound shifts that have undergone, e.g. ǧiřet &#x27;night&#x27; (Arabic: al-layla), hřec &#x27;sick&#x27; (Arabic: halaka).

<doc id="1116344" wikidata="Q637306" url="?curid=1116344" title="Peter Robinson (novelist)">
<text>Peter Robinson (17 March 1950 – 4 October 2022) was a British-born Canadian crime writer who was best known for his crime novels set in Yorkshire featuring Inspector Alan Banks. He also published a number of other novels and short stories, as well as some poems and two articles on writing.

==Early life==
Robinson was born in Armley, Leeds, on 17 March 1950. His father, Clifford, worked as a photographer; his mother, Miriam (Jarvis), was a homemaker. Robinson studied English literature at the University of Leeds, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts with honours. He then emigrated to Canada in 1974 to continue his studies, obtaining a Master of Arts in English and Creative Writing from the University of Windsor, with Joyce Carol Oates as his tutor. He was later awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in English at York University in 1983.

==Career==
Robinson taught at several colleges and universities in Toronto, and the University of Windsor (his alma mater) as writer-in-residence from 1992 to 1993. He was best known for the Inspector Banks series of novels set in the fictional Yorkshire town of Eastvale. His first novel, &quot;Gallows View&quot;, was published in 1987. It garnered him the Crime Writers of Canada Arthur Ellis Award, which he went on to win six more times during his career. The series was eventually translated into twenty languages by the time of his death. He also wrote two collections of short stories – &quot;Not Safe After Dark&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Price of Love&quot; (2009) – as well as another novel, &quot;Caedmon&#x27;s Song&quot;, released in 1990.

==Personal life==
Robinson resided in the Beaches area of Toronto with his wife, Sheila Halladay, and he occasionally taught crime writing at the University of Toronto&#x27;s School of Continuing Studies. He also taught at a number of Toronto colleges and served as Writer-in-Residence at the University of Windsor, 1992–1993. Robinson and his wife had a holiday cottage in Richmond, North Yorkshire. He died on 4 October 2022, at the age of 72.

== Awards and honours ==
In 2020, Robinson received the Grand Master Award from Crime Writers of Canada, and in 2010, he received their Derrick Murdoch Award. Two years prior, he had been honoured with the Toronto Public Library Celebrates Reading Award.
== Publications ==

===Inspector Banks series===
The novels are set in the fictional English town of Eastvale in the Yorkshire Dales. Robinson has stated that Eastvale is modelled on Ripon and Richmond and is somewhere north of Ripon, close to the A1 road. A former member of the London Metropolitan Police, Inspector Alan Banks leaves the capital for a quieter life in the Dales. Since 2010 several of the novels have been adapted for television under the series title &quot;DCI Banks&quot; with Stephen Tompkinson in the title role.

<text>The Giro di Lombardia (), officially Il Lombardia, is a cycling race in Lombardy, Italy. It is traditionally the last of the five &#x27;Monuments&#x27; of the season, considered to be one of the most prestigious one-day events in cycling, and one of the last events on the UCI World Tour calendar. Nicknamed the &quot;Classica delle foglie morte&quot; (&quot;the Classic of the falling (dead) leaves&quot;), it is the most important Autumn Classic in cycling. The race&#x27;s most famous climb is the Madonna del Ghisallo in the race finale.

The first edition was held in 1905. Since its creation, the Giro di Lombardia has been the classic with the fewest interruptions in cycling; only the editions of 1943 and 1944 were cancelled for reasons of war. Italian Fausto Coppi won a record five times.

Because of its demanding course, the race is considered a &quot;climbers classic&quot;, favouring climbers with strong descending skills and a strong sprint finish.

==History==

===Milan–Milan===
The Tour of Lombardy was created as an idea of journalist Tullo Morgagni. Morgagni wanted to give Milanese rider Pierino Albini the opportunity to take revenge for his defeat against Giovanni Cuniolo in the short-lived &quot;Italian King&#x27;s Cup&quot;. His newspaper la Gazzetta dello Sport organized a new race as a &#x27;rematch&#x27; on 12 November 1905, called &quot;Milano–Milano&quot;. The race attracted vast crowds along the course and ended in Milan with the victory of Giovanni Gerbi, at the time one of the stars of cycling. Gerbi won the race 40 minutes ahead of Giovanni Rossignoli and Luigi Ganna.
The race soon became a fixture as the closing race of the Italian and European cycling season. It was renamed &quot;Giro di Lombardia&quot; in 1907. After the pioneering years, the race was dominated alternately by Frenchman Henri Pélissier and local heroes Gaetano Belloni and Costante Girardengo, all winning the race three times.

===Race of the Champions===

From the 1930s to the 1950s, Alfredo Binda, Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi, icons of Italian cycling, were the main protagonists and immortalized the race with their exploits. Coppi won the race 5 times (of which 4 consecutive wins) and Binda 4 times. Coppi finished solo on every win, following a successful strategy of attacking on the Madonna del Ghisallo and maintaining his lead to the finish in Milan. Gino Bartali was the king of the podium with 9 top-3 finishes (3 wins, 4 second places and 2 third places).

The race of 1956 was a particularly fascinating battle. At 60 km from the finish a breakaway was formed with Fausto Coppi, seeking his sixth victory. Italian rider Fiorenzo Magni had missed the break, and as he fell further behind, a car passed him with Giulia Occhini, Coppi&#x27;s infamous mistress, sitting in the back. The two did not get on and as her car passed, Magni saw her sneer at him. Infuriated, Magni set out in an improbable solo pursuit of the breakaway and caught the leaders in the final kilometres. He and Coppi openly argued and André Darrigade, sensing their indecisiveness, attacked to claim the victory, thereby relegating Coppi and Magni to second and third place.

In 1961, the finish of the Tour of Lombardy was moved from Milan to Como and the identity of the race changed fundamentally. The previous flat finale towards the finish in Milan was replaced with a spectacular finish by Lake Como, just 6 km after the top of the last climb. Despite an occasional return to finishing in Milan, the race had developed a new personality, defined by a series of arduous climbs amid a mountainous scenery.

Over the years the race has been dominated mainly by Italian riders. Frenchman Henri Pelissier and Ireland&#x27;s Sean Kelly were the only non-Italian riders to win the race three times. Cycling legend Eddy Merckx won three consecutive victories from 1971 to 1973, but his last win was stripped after a positive doping test and awarded to second-place finisher Felice Gimondi.

The race of 1974 gave birth to another memorable anecdote. Eddy Merckx wanted to get his revenge, but fellow Belgian Roger De Vlaeminck attacked early in the race, inducing Merckx to make his team work in pursuit. De Vlaeminck, not really intending to go solo, stopped and hid behind a bush to let the peloton pass. He rode back to the front of the peloton and jokingly asked a baffled Merckx whom they were chasing. De Vlaeminck won the race ahead of Merckx.

===The Autumn Classic===
For nearly 70 years the race was called &quot;il Mondiale d&#x27;Autunno&quot; in Italy (&quot;the World Championship of Autumn&quot;), as the real World Championship was held at the end of summer. It lost this particular role in 1995 when the UCI revolutionized the international cycling calendar and moved the World Championship from August to October, one week before the Giro di Lombardia.

From 1988 to 2004 the Tour of Lombardy was the final leg of the UCI Road World Cup and was often the decisive race in that competition. In 1997 Michele Bartoli needed to finish ahead of Rolf Sørensen in the race to be the winner of the 1997 World Cup. For 30 km he did solo work in a four-man breakaway, so sacrificing his chances to win the sprint. The edition was won by Frenchman Laurent Jalabert, Bartoli finished fourth and won the World Cup.
The race had become the most important &quot;Autumn Classic&quot; together with Paris–Tours in France, which was mainly won by sprinters or escapees. By the early 21st century however, Paris–Tours lost its status as a World Tour race, and the Tour of Lombardy was the one remaining major Classic in autumn, the only Monument in the latter part of the year. Damiano Cunego imposed himself as the &quot;Lord of Lombardy&quot; with three victories.

In 2006, the race celebrated its 100th edition, won by Paolo Bettini, one week after becoming world champion. The edition was particularly emotional because Bettini&#x27;s brother had died in a car accident just five days before the race, and the Italian was overcome with emotion when he crossed the finish line. Bettini is one of seven riders to win the Tour of Lombardy after becoming world champion earlier the same year. The other six are Alfredo Binda, Tom Simpson, Eddy Merckx, Felice Gimondi, Giuseppe Saronni and Oscar Camenzind.

Since 2012 both the World Championship and the Giro di Lombardia have a new, earlier date on the calendar at the end of September, and the name officially became &quot;Il Lombardia&quot;. It was the beginning of a remarkable revival for the Monument race. The Tour of Lombardy is now the classic &quot;par excellence&quot; for riders to take revenge for the world championship or to achieve an &quot;&quot;Autumn Double&quot; win&quot;. In recent years Philippe Gilbert, Joaquim Rodríguez and Vincenzo Nibali all won the race twice.

==Route==

Like most of cycling&#x27;s classics, the route has developed over the years, and the Tour of Lombardy has undergone more changes than any other cycling monument. Since the 1960s it has been notable for its hilly and varied course around Lake Como, to the northeast of Milan, with a flat finish in one of the cities on the shores of the lake.

Its signature symbol is the climb of the Madonna del Ghisallo, one of the iconic sanctuaries in cycling. The climb starts near Bellagio at the shore of the Como Lake, and heads up until the church of Madonna del Ghisallo (754 m), the patroness of cyclists. Over the years, it has become indelibly linked with the race and with cycling in general. It was the favourite climb of cycling greatnesses Fausto Coppi and Gino Bartali, who immortalized it. The church also serves as a museum containing religious and cycling-related objects.

===Course changes===
Originally the Tour of Lombardy was raced from Milan to Milan, and like many cycling classics, climbs were gradually introduced to the course, in a bid to make the race more demanding. In 1961, the finish was moved to Como and the character of the race changed fundamentally. The long and flat run-in to the finish in Milan was abandoned; in its place came a mountainous lake-side finish, just 6 km from the top of the last climb. The route usually has some changes every year, sometimes a complete restyling, only to be altered again the next edition.
From 1984 to 1989 the finish returned to Milan and in 1990 to its suburb Monza, inviting attackers for long-distance breakaways. From 1995 to 2003 the finish was in Bergamo, with the Colle del Gallo (Col Gàl in Bergamasque) as the last climb of the day. The Colle del Gallo, with its sanctuary of the &quot;Madonna dei ciclisti&quot; at the top, often proved to be decisive.

In 2004, after twenty years, the finish returned to the lakefront in Como, with the short but steep San Fermo della Battaglia climb just before the arrival. The 2010 edition saw the re-introduction of the Muro di Sormano, a spectacular climb with a maximum gradient of 27%, which replaced the Civiglio after the Ghisallo.

In 2011 the route was fully renewed, with a first-time finish in Lecco. The Sormano was included again, but was climbed before the Ghisallo. After the Ghisallo, a flat stretch led to the final climb of the race: the steep Villa Vergano in Galbiate. After the descent only 3 km remained until the finish in Lecco. The 3,4 km climb of Villa Vergano was the decisive site in the 2011 and 2012 edition.

In 2014 the finish was moved to Bergamo. Organizer RCS announced that from 2014 to 2017 the finish of the Tour of Lombardy will alternate between Bergamo and Como.

===Race characteristics===
The Giro di Lombardia is considered a climbers classic and one of the most arduous races of the season, because of its distance (ca. 255 km) and several famous climbs. Nowadays the route usually features five or six significant climbs. The best-known of them is the Madonna del Ghisallo, one of the few fixed locations of the race. The climb is 10,6 kilometres long, with an average gradient of 5.2% and stretches of over 10%.
Because the race usually has a downhill or flat run-in to the finish, the main contenders are riders with a broad range of skills. As such, the course favours climbers with a strong sprint finish and even Grand Tour specialists. Time trial specialist Tony Rominger won the Tour of Lombardy twice in the 1990s and Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali won the 2015 edition after a downhill attack on the penultimate descent. The race is often compared to Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the monument race in Belgium earlier in the year. Both classics have a similar hilly course and show a similar palmarès since the 1960s, but are different in character. The hills in Lombardy are usually longer than those in the Belgian Ardennes and are more spread out over the course. Liège–Bastogne–Liège has 12 categorized climbs, usually shorter and steeper, coming in faster succession than in the Tour of Lombardy, and has an uphill-finish.
Because of its position in autumn as one of the last classics of the year, the race is commonly nicknamed the &quot;Race of the Falling Leaves&quot;. Consequently, the weather repeatedly plays a decisive role in the nature of the race. In bad weather - common to mountainous Lombardy - the race is often a grueling contest where the strongest riders attack well ahead of the finish. The editions of 2006, 2010, and 2012 were exceptionally rainy. In 2010 Philippe Gilbert and Michele Scarponi attacked with 40 km to go; Gilbert distanced Scarponi on the San Fermo della Battaglia and won the race. In 2012 Gilbert crashed on a wet descent.

When the weather conditions are good, teams are able to control the race more easily and decisive attacks come later in the race. On sunny days, the leaves on the trees typically blaze a golden trail around Lombardy, and TV coverage displays extensive aerial footage of the scenery around the Como Lake. The Italian press, never shy to introduce a poetic epithet, has also coined the phrase &quot;The Romantic Classic&quot; to denote the race.

==Trittico di Autunno==

The Trittico di Autunno &quot;(Autumn Triptych)&quot; is an unofficial trio of cycling classics held in the Lombardy and Piedmont regions of Northern Italy, in early October. Three one-day races, Milano–Torino, the Giro del Piemonte (Tour of Piedmont) and the Tour of Lombardy, are held within a four-day timeframe in the week following the World Championship. Milan-Turin is held on the Thursday after the World Championship, the Giro del Piemonte on Friday and the Tour of Lombardy is the closing race on Sunday. The Tour of Lombardy is the pinnacle, the hardest and unequivocally most important race of this unofficial trio.

All three races have a rich history, dating back more than a century. Milan-Turin, with its first running in 1876, is the oldest classic in the world, three decades older than the Tour of Lombardy. Until 1986, and again from 2005 to 2007, Milan-Turin was organized in the spring. Since 1987 the three races are held as an &quot;Autumn Trio&quot;, initially mid-October and since 2012 two weeks earlier. Both Milan-Turin and the Giro del Piemonte have suffered some continuity problems in the past, but are on back on the calendar of 2015. For many, particularly Italian riders, Milan-Turin and the Giro del Piemonte (both 200-km races) are the ultimate races to prepare for the Tour of Lombardy.

==Milan–San Remo and Tour of Lombardy Double==
The Tour of Lombardy is one of five Monuments in cycling, one of two Italian Monuments together with Milan–San Remo. Milan–San Remo is called the &quot;Spring Classic&quot; and considered a sprinters race, whereas the Tour of Lombardy is called the &quot;Autumn Classic&quot; and considered a climbers race. In total, 21 riders have won both races at least once in their career. Following Paolo Bettini, the most recent one to do this was Vincenzo Nibali who won the &quot;Primavera&quot; in 2018 and the Tour of Lombardy in 2015 and 2017.

Winning Milan–San Remo and the Tour of Lombardy in the same year is considered as something of a &quot;holy grail&quot; in Italian cycling, dubbed by Italian press as &quot;La Doppietta&quot; (The Double). Seven riders have achieved this feat, on ten occasions. Fausto Coppi did it three consecutive times, Eddy Merckx is the last rider as yet.

<doc id="1116381" wikidata="Q847237" url="?curid=1116381" title="Goodbye Mr Mackenzie">
<text>Goodbye Mr Mackenzie is a Scottish rock band formed in Bathgate near Edinburgh. At the band&#x27;s commercial peak, the line-up consisted of Martin Metcalfe on vocals, John Duncan on guitar, Fin Wilson on bass guitar, Shirley Manson and Rona Scobie on keyboards and backing vocals, and Derek Kelly on drums.

The band came to prominence in the early 1980s after releasing two independent label singles, and were signed to Capitol Records. They charted in the United Kingdom with their debut album, &quot;Good Deeds and Dirty Rags&quot; and single release &quot;The Rattler&quot;, but the band were hindered by record company conflicts and failed to break through outside the UK. The band split up in 1993, leaving Manson, Metcalfe, Wilson and Kelly to form Angelfish to continue recording music. Manson left for Garbage in 1994, and Goodbye Mr Mackenzie played their final live show at the end of 1995.

In 2019, Goodbye Mr Mackenzie reformed and embarked on a tour of Scotland. Manson did not join her former bandmates due to work commitments with Garbage. Metcalfe claimed that the band had asked Manson to join them on the tour, claiming that &quot;people do not realise how busy she is&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career (1984–1987)===
The band began when Martin Metcalfe moved on from his first band Teenage Dog Orgy in 1984. They were named after author Jean Rhys&#x27;s 1931 novel &quot;After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie&quot;.

Their first single was released through a pilot music industry course run by Bathgate College under the Youth Training Scheme, a split-single 7-inch format of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; in 1984. Limited to 1,000 copies, and with a track by Lindy Bergman on the flipside, it quickly sold out. Shortly after, they signed a management deal with Precious Organisation, who had just launched another Scottish group, Wet Wet Wet. Precious managed to include both groups on &quot;Honey at the Core&quot;, a 1986 compilation of up and coming Scottish acts compiled by Glasgow Herald journalist John Williamson, and released the band&#x27;s first commercial single &quot;The Rattler&quot;. The single suffered from a lack of distribution, but received airplay on Radio One and Radio Clyde. A home-made music video for the single was broadcast on &quot;The Chart Show&quot;. The band also performed &quot;The Rattler&quot; on &quot;The Tube&quot;. Precious organised an A&amp;R showcase in Glasgow but, as the band did not receive any interest from the labels invited, they chose to leave Precious.

===Debut album and &quot;Hammer and Tongs&quot; (1987–1992)===

After leaving their management, they released an independent 12-inch single, &quot;Face to Face&quot;, in 1987, and signed a major label record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol issued three multi-formatted singles, of which a re-release of &quot;The Rattler&quot; was the most successful, charting at No. 37 in 1989. The label followed up the band&#x27;s chart debut with &quot;Good Deeds and Dirty Rags&quot;, which reached No. 23 on the UK Albums Chart. A further single from the album, &quot;Goodwill City&quot;, reversed the band&#x27;s upward trend, stalling at No. 49. Capitol ended the year by releasing &quot;Fish Heads and Tails&quot;, a mid-price live and B-side compilation, while the band relocated to studios in Berlin to record their second album. While at the studios, the band witnessed the Fall of the Berlin Wall.

The following year, the band were transferred sideways across EMI, from Capitol to Parlophone, who released two new recordings &quot;Love Child&quot; and &quot;Blacker Than Black&quot; (the latter being released across Europe and in North America) as taster singles. Both tracks failed to gain on the chart position set by &quot;The Rattler&quot; a year prior, and in response Parlophone cancelled the planned album release for the group&#x27;s second set, titled &quot;Hammer and Tongs&quot;. The band continued to tour heavily, became radio mainstays on Scottish radio and performed at the televised concert &quot;The Big Day&quot; on Glasgow Green.

===&quot;Five&quot; (1992–1994)===

Gary Kurfirst, who managed Talking Heads and Debbie Harry, bought the band&#x27;s contract from Parlophone and signed them to his own label, Radioactive, a subsidiary of MCA. Radioactive were keen to release the band&#x27;s second album, but required a chart friendly track. They completed recording &quot;Now We Are Married&quot;, in Edinburgh, and Radioactive issued it as a single ahead of &quot;Hammer and Tongs&quot;. Both releases again failed to chart, and the group were persuaded to leave the label by their management. Radioactive meanwhile released a compilation of the band&#x27;s two albums self-titled as &quot;Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie&quot; in North America, Europe, Australia and Japan.

The band continued to write material; Manson was also given the opportunity to record lead vocals on a number of tracks planned for the band&#x27;s third album, titled &quot;Five&quot;. In the end, Manson only featured on a duet, &quot;Normal Boy&quot;. The band issued the album on their own Blokshok label.

===Angelfish and disbandment (1994)===
With relations between MCA and the band&#x27;s management hitting a low point, the band left MCA. Gary Kurfirst wanted to keep working with the band and suggested they record a whole album with Shirley Manson on lead vocals. After hearing several demos, Kurfirst signed Manson to Radioactive as a solo artist, with Metcalfe, Kelly and Wilson signing the publishing deal. Recording under the name Angelfish, and using some of the newly written material and a previously released Mackenzie B-side, Manson and the group recorded the tracks that would make up the &quot;Angelfish&quot; album in Connecticut with Talking Heads&#x27; Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. A lead in track &quot;Suffocate Me&quot; sent to college radio where it was well received. &quot;Angelfish&quot; and second single &quot;Heartbreak to Hate&quot; followed in 1994. Angelfish toured the United States, Canada, France, Belgium, and co-supported Live on a tour of North America, along with Vic Chesnutt.

The music video for &quot;Suffocate Me&quot; was aired on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. Producer and musician Steve Marker saw the broadcast and thought Manson would be a great singer for his band, Garbage, which also featured producers Duke Erikson and Butch Vig. Manson left Angelfish, and The Mackenzies, to join the group in 1994. Derek Kelly, Fin Wilson and Martin Metcalfe formed a new band, Isa &amp; the Filthy Tongues, with American singer Stacey Chavis.

===Reformation (2019–present)===
In an interview with the Edinburgh Evening News on 4 April 2019, Martin Metcalfe announced that Goodbye Mr Mackenzie would be reforming and would be performing a mini Scottish Tour. Warm up gigs were performed in Dundee on 17 May and Dunfermline on 18 May, followed by full shows in Glasgow at The Garage (venue of their farewell concert) on 22 May, Aberdeen Lemon Tree on 23 May and Edinburgh Liquid Rooms on 25 and 26 May 2019. These shows were followed up by a winter tour of the UK, culminating in a sold out performance at the Glasgow Barrowlands on 20 December.

During interviews to promote their tour, Metcalfe revealed that a number of hurdles had to be overcome to reunite the band, including Duncan&#x27;s multiple sclerosis and the fact that Scobie had not played keyboard in over 20 years. He described Duncan&#x27;s ability to relearn his guitar parts in spite of his ongoing health concerns as &quot;something of a miracle&quot;. A documentary about the reunion entitled &quot;Until the End of the Road&quot; was released in 2020.

A live album entitled &quot;A Night in the Windy City&quot; was released in February 2021 and featured their 2019 performance at the Glasgow Barrowlands.

In April 2024, the band announced six more concerts in October to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their third album, &quot;Five&quot;. The same month, the album was remastered and reissued. On 1 December 2024, &quot;Five&quot; was released digitally.

<text>The cavatina &quot;&quot; is an aria for Figaro from the first act of the opera &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The libretto was written by Lorenzo Da Ponte based on a stage comedy by Pierre Beaumarchais, &quot;La folle journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro&quot; (1778). The Italian title means &quot;If you want to dance&quot;. Figaro&#x27;s voice type is given as bass in the score, but in modern performance practice is sung by a bass-baritone.

Susanna has told her fiancé Figaro that the count intends to exercise his newly reasserted feudal , the , to sleep with her before their marriage. Figaro sings of how he will unravel the count&#x27;s schemes and thwart him.

<doc id="1116402" wikidata="Q5464591" url="?curid=1116402" title="Folklore of Sarajevo">
<text>As a historic city, [[Sarajevo]] has numerous myths and folklore. The character Nasrudin Hodža is popular throughout the former lands of the Ottoman Empire, and Sarajevo is no exception. Numerous stories about him dealing with the city have been written over the years. A famous piece of Sarajevo folklore is the story of the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was said that when a request came to build it, authorities required that it be no higher than the tallest minaret in Sarajevo. A wise old man was then said to have advised that the church be built into the ground. Thus the building reached a proper height but met the restrictions.

Numerous other famous bits of Sarajevo folklore survive representing many different eras of Sarajevo&#x27;s history. One of the earliest is the story of the Goat&#x27;s Bridge. As the story goes, an old goat herder was tending his goats by the river Miljacka when one of them started ferociously digging at a certain spot of the ground. Mystified, he walked over for a closer look only to find numerous sacks of gold. With the gold, he then built a great bridge over the river that would for years be the main crossing for travelers on their way to Istanbul.

Far more recent is the story of Sarajevo&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet. During the Serbian siege of Sarajevo the couple of a young Serb boy and Bosniak girl decided to flee the city. They got as far as the Sniper Alley&#x27;s &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; before the boy was shot dead and the girl wounded by the Serbs. Rather than flee alone however, she turned to stay by her lover&#x27;s side, where she too eventually died. This is not a myth; their names were Boško Brkić and Admira Ismić, and they died on the Vrbanja bridge in May 1993.

<text>Madonna del Ghisallo is a hill in Magreglio, close to Lake Como in Italy. It is named after an alleged Marian apparition.

According to the legend, the Medieval count Ghisallo was travelling by the hamlet of Magréglio when he was attacked by bandits. He saw an image of Virgin Mary at a shrine, ran to it and was saved from the robbers. The apparition became known as La Madonna del Ghisallo, and she became a patroness of local travellers.

In later times, the hill Madonna del Ghisallo was made part of the Giro di Lombardia bicycle race and has often featured in the Giro d&#x27;Italia as well. The church sits atop a steep hill that climbs up from the shores of Lake Como. It became a natural stopping point for cyclists.

For this reason a local priest, Father Ermelindo Vigano, proposed that La Madonna del Ghisallo be declared the patroness of cyclists. This was confirmed by Pope Pius XII in 1949. Nowadays the shrine of Madonna del Ghisallo contains a small cycling museum with photos and artefacts from the sport. There also burns an eternal flame for cyclists who have died. One particularly notable artifact is the crumpled bicycle that Fabio Casartelli, a native of the region, rode on the day that he died in a crash in the Tour de France.

The church is home to many bikes and cycling jerseys used by cyclists in races. The Fondazione Museo del Ciclismo-Madonna del Ghisallo was created in 2000. Its first action was to organize a torch relay from the chapel to the Vatican, delivering the torch to the then Pope John Paul II. In 2010 a bike museum, the Museo del Ghisallo, opened nearby.

The Colle del Ghisallo is a mountain pass road that connects the upper part of Valassina Larian Triangle. The point of the pass, at an altitude of 754 m above sea level, is located near Magreglio.

<text>Frank Wynne (born 1962) is an Irish literary translator and writer.

== Biography ==
Born in County Sligo in the west of Ireland, Frank Wynne worked as a comics editor at Fleetway and later at comic magazine &quot;Deadline&quot;. He worked for a time at AOL, before becoming a literary translator. He has translated many authors, including Michel Houellebecq, Boualem Sansal, Frédéric Beigbeder and the late Ivoirian novelist Ahmadou Kourouma.

He has twice jointly won the International Dublin Literary Award: with Houellebecq for &quot;Atomised&quot; (his translation of &quot;Les Particules élémentaires&quot;); and with Alice Zeniter for &quot;The Art of Losing&quot; (his translation of &quot;L&#x27;Art de Perdre&quot;). His translation of Frédéric Beigbeder&#x27;s &quot;Windows on the World&quot;, a novel set in the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York during the September 11, 2001 attacks, won the 2005 Independent Foreign Fiction Prize.

Notably, he is a two-time winner of both the Scott Moncrieff Translation Prize for translation from the French (in 2008 for Frédéric Beigbeder&#x27;s &quot;Holiday in a Coma&quot; and &quot;Love Lasts Three Years&quot; and in 2015 for Boualem Sansal&#x27;s &quot;Harraga&quot;) and the Premio Valle Inclán for Spanish Translation (in 2011 for Marcelo Figueras&#x27;s &quot;Kamchatka&quot; and in 2013 for Alonso Cueto&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Hour&quot;).

Wynne&#x27;s book &quot;I Was Vermeer&quot;, a biography of Han van Meegeren, was published by Bloomsbury in August 2006 and serialised as the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Book of the Week&quot; (read by Anton Lesser) in August 2006.

Wynne has edited two major anthologies for Head of Zeus: &quot;Found in Translation: 100 of the finest stories every translated&quot;, (2018) and the &quot;QUEER: LGBTQ Writing from Ancient Times to Yesterday&quot; (2021).

In 2021, it was announced that he would be the Chair of the judging panel of the 2022 International Booker Prize – the first time a translator has chaired the panel.

<doc id="1116419" wikidata="Q1269924" url="?curid=1116419" title="Ashy storm petrel">
<text>The ashy storm petrel (Hydrobates homochroa) is a small, scarce seabird of the storm petrel family Hydrobatidae. It breeds colonially on islands off the coasts of California and Mexico, and is one of six species of storm petrel that live and feed in the rich California Current system.

==Taxonomy==
The ashy storm petrel was first described by American ornithologist Elliott Coues in 1864. Both its common and scientific name, &quot;homochroa&quot;, &quot;uniformly colored&quot;, from Ancient Greek (h)omoia (&quot;όμοια&quot;), &quot;alike&quot; + &quot;chroma&quot; (&quot;χρώμα&quot;) &quot;color&quot;, come from its coloration.

It was formerly defined in the genus &quot;Oceanodroma&quot; before that genus was synonymized with &quot;Hydrobates&quot;.

==Description and ecology==
This is a small, uniformly sooty-brown storm petrel with a forked tail, closely resembling the black storm petrel, but it is smaller and has a more fluttering style of flight, with the upstroke only becoming horizontal to the body before beginning the downstroke (other storm petrels in its range have a higher upstroke).

It is a gregarious bird at sea, feeding nocturnally on cephalopods, fish (particularly the deep-sea myctophids, which rise to the sea&#x27;s surface at night) and euphausiid krill such as &quot;Thysanoessa spinifera&quot;, which also swarm at the surface. They also attend fishing vessels for the fish oils released when the nets are pulled.

Ashy storm petrels nest in rock burrows on offshore islands, returning to the nests at night. The species has a long breeding cycle, laying eggs in May and fledging in October, although timing varies greatly, more so than in most other storm petrels; some pairs may have a chick that is half grown when other pairs are still laying. Like in many other seabirds, pairs show both mate and site fidelity, mating in the same pair with the same mate for many years and nesting at the same burrow, despite the pairs spending their lives out of the breeding season separate from each other, and despite the fact that many individuals might seem to compete for burrows at the nesting colonies. A change in mate is usually associated with a change in nesting site.

The ashy storm petrel is a long-lived bird; a banded individual has lived at least 31 years.

==Distribution, status, and threats==
Ashy storm petrels breed on 17 islands in the northeast Pacific, principally off the coast of California, but including a few sites off the coast of northwestern Mexico. Half the world&#x27;s population nests on the Farallon Islands near San Francisco. Other breeding islands include the eight Channel Islands of California and a small population on Mexico&#x27;s Coronados. Bat Cave, on the north side of Santa Cruz Island in Southern California, has the largest nesting colony for the ashy storm petrel in the world, with over 100 nests. Outside of the breeding season, it is believed to be more widely distributed, foraging on the California Current, but it undertakes no large migration and does not range as far as other species of storm petrels. In the early fall, large flocks can be seen in Monterey Bay. The birds do not range inland any significant distance except when storm-blown; for example, a sighting in San Mateo County, California was considered &quot;unusual&quot; by an experienced naturalist.

The world population is estimated to be around 10,000 birds, 8,000 of them breeders, with the Farallon population having declined by one-third between 1972 and 1992. The ashy storm petrel is designated as a species of conservation concern in California. It is threatened by western gull and burrowing owl predation, illumination from fishing boats, introduced predators such as rats and feral cats, and pollution. Most of the islands where it breeds are covered by some degree of protection.

Global warming could have a profound impact on ashy storm petrels. Future changes to coastal California waters due to global warming could result in warmer, less productive waters, which would mean less food would be available for the petrels. In addition, ocean acidification may result in a decline of crustacean prey species due to the effects that excess CO2 will have on the animals&#x27; shells. Sea-level rise will also threaten certain nesting sites that would be located too close to water.

<doc id="1116423" wikidata="Q168647" url="?curid=1116423" title="Henry II, Duke of Austria">
<text>Henry II (; 1107 – 13 January 1177), called Jasomirgott, a member of the House of Babenberg, was Count Palatine of the Rhine from 1140 to 1141, Duke of Bavaria (as &quot;Henry XI&quot;) and Margrave of Austria from 1141 to 1156, and the first Duke of Austria from 1156 until his death. 

==Family==
Henry was the second son of Margrave Leopold III of Austria, from his second marriage with Agnes of Waiblingen, a sister of the last Salian emperor, Henry V. Leopold himself was expected to stand as a candidate in the 1125 election as king of Germany; nevertheless, he renounced in favour of his step-son (and Henry&#x27;s half-brother), the Hohenstaufen duke Frederick II of Swabia, who eventually lost against Lothair of Supplinburg. Among Henry&#x27;s younger brothers were Bishop Otto of Freising and Archbishop Conrad II of Salzburg. His sister Judith became the wife of Marquess William V of Montferrat.

Henry&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Jasomirgott&quot;, was first documented during the 13th century in the form of &quot;Jochsamergott&quot;, the meaning of which is unclear. According to popular etymology, it is derived from the Middle High German form of the oath &quot;joch sam mir got helfe&quot; (meaning: &quot;Yes, so help me God&quot;).

==Reign==

When Margrave Leopold III died in 1136, he was succeeded by his third-born son Leopold IV, probably because Henry already administered the Rhenish possessions of his mother&#x27;s now-extinct Salian dynasty. In April 1140, the Hohenstaufen king Conrad III of Germany enfeoffed him with the County Palatine of the Rhine, which he ruled for only a short time as he was appointed Bavarian duke and margrave of Austria when his younger brother Leopold IV unexpectedly died in October 1141. Leopold had received the Duchy of Bavaria in 1139, after King Conrad had deposed Duke Henry the Proud in the course of the dispute between the Welf and Hohenstaufen dynasties. 

Henry took his residence in the Bavarian capital of Regensburg (&quot;Ratisbona&quot;). In May 1142 he married Gertrude, daughter of Emperor Lothair and widow of Henry the Proud. She died after less than one year, giving birth to her only child with Henry.

The duke remained a loyal follower of the Hohenstaufens and in May 1147 accompanied King Conrad on the Second Crusade. When they suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Dorylaeum against the Seljuk Turks in October, Henry narrowly escaped together with Conrad&#x27;s nephew, young Frederick Barbarossa. Later on, he attended the Council of Acre along with king Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa, then the Siege of Damascus. On their way home, Henry stayed at the court of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos, where he married his niece Theodora in late 1148.

Elected king of Germany in 1152, Frederick Barbarossa tried to reach a compromise with the Welfs and endowed Henry the Lion, son of the late Henry the Proud, with the Duchy of Bavaria in 1156. A replacement duchy had to be found for the Babenberg family, which was accomplished by the &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot;, through which Frederick elevated Henry&#x27;s Margraviate of Austria to a duchy with complete independence from Bavaria.

Unlike his father, who had resided in Klosterneuburg most of the time, Henry moved his Austrian residence to Vienna in 1145. Only by this act could Vienna surpass other cities within the duchy, such as Krems, Melk, and Klosterneuburg. Since then, it has remained the capital of the country. In addition, in 1147 the first St. Stephen&#x27;s Church was completed, becoming a visible landmark for the city and showing its prominence. In 1155, Henry founded the Schottenstift monastery in Vienna, in the courtyard of which a statue of him stands to this day.

In November 1176, while his Austrian lands were campaigned by the forces of Duke Soběslav II of Bohemia, Henry II with his horse fell from a rotten bridge near Melk and suffered a femoral neck fracture. Henry II succumbed to his injuries on 13 January 1177 in Vienna. According to his last will, he was buried in the Schottenstift monastery.

==Marriage and children==
Until 1143, Henry II was married to Gertrude of Süpplingenburg, the daughter of Emperor Lothair II. In 1148 he married Theodora Komnene, niece of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I. Both marriages were an expression of the importance of the Babenberg dynasty in Central Europe in that period.

Henry had one child by Gertrude of Süpplingenburg:
* Richenza (1143 – unknown), married to Heinrich Landgraf von Steffling

Henry had three children by Theodora Komnene:

<text>ISO 18245 is an ISO standard concerning the assignment of merchant category codes (MCC) in retail financial services.

These are used to control usage of corporate credit cards. MCCs are assigned by merchant type (e.g. one for hotels, one for office supply stores, etc.), with each merchant being assigned an MCC by the bank. Corporations can then control which MCCs their employees may use their corporate cards at, and this is enforced through the authorization system.

They are four digits in length. For example, MCC 5967 represents &quot;Inbound
telemarketing merchants.&quot;

New MCCs can be applied for through TC68. They are generally reserved for merchant categories having at least $10 million annual revenue.

===Emoji modifiers===

The Miscellaneous Symbols block has two emoji that represent people or body parts.
They can be modified using U+1F3FB–U+1F3FF to provide for a range of human skin color using the Fitzpatrick scale:
Additional human emoji can be found in other Unicode blocks: Dingbats, Emoticons, Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs, Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs, Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A and Transport and Map Symbols.

==History==
In Unicode 1.0 (1991) the same block was named Miscellaneous Dingbats (not to be confused with current &quot;Dingbats&quot; block, which was then renamed to &quot;Zapf Dingbats&quot;).

The following Unicode-related documents record the purpose and process of defining specific characters in the Miscellaneous Symbols block:

<doc id="1116453" wikidata="Q7739170" url="?curid=1116453" title="The Heart of Chicago 1967–1997">
<text>The Heart of Chicago 1967–1997 is the fifth greatest hits album, and twenty-third album overall, by the American band Chicago, released in 1997. It was compiled to commemorate the group&#x27;s 30th anniversary of their formation.

The idea was to bridge their two eras on one CD: the James William Guercio and Columbia Records period of the 1970s, and the David Foster and Warner Bros. Records period of the 1980s. In addition, the band added two new songs, &quot;The Only One&quot; produced by Lenny Kravitz and &quot;Here in My Heart&quot; by James Newton Howard. Both of these new tracks were successful in the adult contemporary market; &quot;Here in My Heart&quot; topped the AC charts, and &quot;The Only One&quot; was a top 20 AC hit.

Though the album was certified gold following its April 1997 release, many critics and fans disapproved of the concept, due to the clashing styles of both decades, and the lack of many significant hits such as &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;, &quot;Call on Me&quot;, and &quot;What Kind of Man Would I Be?&quot;. To balance this out, a second album, &quot;The Heart of Chicago 1967–1998 Volume II&quot; was released the following year to fill in the missing gaps that were left in the first one. Rhino Records&#x27; 2002 two-CD release &quot;The Very Best of Chicago: Only the Beginning, &quot;with chronological sequencing, is generally considered to supersede both volumes of &quot;The Heart of Chicago&quot;.

<text>ISO/IEC 15897 (&quot;Procedures for the registration of cultural elements&quot;) is an ISO/IEC standard for the registration of new POSIX locales and POSIX charmaps. This standard is the result of a &quot;fast-track&quot; adoption of CEN ENV 12005, a European prestandard published by CEN. It was originally published in 1999, and a second edition was published in 2011.

The standard was produced by Working Group 20 (WG20) of the JTC 1/SC 22 committee, but in 2006 the standard was transferred to the JTC 1/SC 35 committee. The registry is maintained by Danish UNIX-systems User Group (DKUUG), although it has not been updated since December 2001. The standard was confirmed in 2017, following a five-yearly systematic review.

Items registered in the registry are:
*Narrative Cultural Specifications
*POSIX Locales
*POSIX Charmaps
*Repertoiremaps

It overlaps somewhat with the CLDR project hosted at the Unicode Consortium.

<text>Proskynesis (), also called proscynesis () or proskinesis (; ; ), was a solemn gesture of respect towards gods and people in many societies. Among the Persians, it referred to a man prostrating himself and kissing the land or the limbs of a respected person. It was also one of the religious rites among both Greeks and Romans.

In Byzantine society, it was a common gesture of supplication or reverence. The physical act ranged from full-fledged prostration or alternatively genuflection, a bow, or a simple greeting that concretized the relative positions of performer and beneficiary within a hierarchical order ( ).

==Etymology==
The Greek word is derived from the verb προσκυνέω, &quot;proskyneo&quot;, itself formed from the compound words πρός, &quot;pros&quot; (towards) and κυνέω, &quot;kyneo&quot; ([I] kiss). It describes an attitude of humbling, submission, or worship adoration – particularly towards a sovereign ruler, God or the gods.

==Practice==
According to Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot;, a person of equal rank received a kiss on the lips; someone of a slightly lower rank gave a kiss on the cheek; and someone of a very inferior social standing had to completely bow down to the other person before them. To the Greeks, giving proskynesis to a mortal was seen as barbaric and ludicrous. In his &quot;Anabasis&quot; (3.2.13), Xenophon cites the Greek refusal to perform &quot;proskynesis&quot; as a sign of their freedom distinguishing them from the Persians: &quot;As tokens of these victories [over Xerxes&#x27;s invasion] we may, indeed, still behold the trophies, but the strongest witness to them is the freedom of the states in which you were born and bred; for to no human creature do you pay homage as master, but to the gods alone [οὐδένα γὰρ ἄνθρωπον δεσπότην ἀλλὰ τοὺς θεοὺς προσκυνεῖτε].&quot;

=== Applications ===
The Persian custom may have led some Greeks to believe that they worshipped their king as a god, the only person who received proskynesis from everyone, and other misinterpretations caused cultural conflicts. Proskynȇsis was not a specific custom of the Achaemenid court alone, since it was practiced earlier in the Assyrian court. Contrary to the suggestions of Greek authors, Near Eastern sources leave no doubt that proskynȇsis did not have the character of a religious gesture, but was an element of the court ceremony.

Alexander the Great proposed this practice during his lifetime in adapting to the local customs of the Persian areas he conquered, but it was not accepted by his Greek companions (such as noted by the court historian, Callisthenes); he later did not insist on the practice. Most of his men could cope with Alexander&#x27;s interest for having a Persian wardrobe, but honoring the king as if he was a god with proskynesis went a bit too far. According to Arrian, Callisthenes explains the existence of separated ways of honoring a god or a human and that prostration is a way to explicitly honor gods. It is seen as a threat to the Greeks, ‘who are men most devoted to freedom’. According to Callisthenes, prostration was a foreign and degrading fashion.

The emperor Diocletian (AD 284–305) is usually thought to have introduced the practice to the Roman Empire, forming a break with the Republican institutions of the principate, which preserved the form, if not the intent, of republican government. However, there is some evidence that an informal form of proskynesis was already practiced at the court of Septimius Severus. The political reason for this change was to elevate the role of the emperor from &quot;first citizen&quot; to an otherworldly ruler, remote from his subjects, thus reducing the likelihood of successful revolt, which had plagued the Empire during the preceding 50 years.

Certain forms of proskynesis, such as those which entailed kissing the emperor&#x27;s breast, hands, or feet, were reserved to specific categories of officials. The audience granted to native or foreign delegations included multiple series of proskynesis at points marked by porphyry disks (&quot;omphalia&quot;) set in the floor. Until the 10th century at least, imperial ceremonial avoided proskynesis on Sundays out of reverence for the God. As a show of loyalty, proskynesis had strong political overtones; it recurs in imperial iconography and its importance in imperial ceremonial could sometimes raise delicate diplomatic dilemmas when foreign potentates were involved.

Similarly, the emperor was hailed no longer as &quot;Imp(erator)&quot; on coins, which meant &quot;commander in chief&quot; but as &quot;D(ominus) N(oster)&quot; – &quot;Our Lord.&quot; With the conversion of Constantine, I to Christianity, proskynesis became part of an elaborate ritual, whereby the emperor became God&#x27;s on earth. Titular inflation also affected the other principal offices of the Empire. Justinian I and Theodora both insisted on an extreme form of proskynesis, even from members of the Roman Senate, and they were attacked for it by Procopius in his &quot;Secret History&quot;.

==In Christianity==
The verb προσκυνέω (&quot;proskyneo&quot;) is often used in the Septuagint and New Testament for the worship of pagan gods or the worship of the God of Israel. In addition, this word in some cases was used for the worship of angels.

As with the Greeks five centuries earlier, the practice was shocking but prevailed. With the conversion of Constantine to Christianity, it became part of an elaborate ritual, making the emperor &quot;vice-regent of God on earth.&quot;

The question of the admissibility of proskynesis in relation to icons (bowing and kissing to icons) was raised in the 8th century during the period of iconoclasm. Opponents of proskynesis in relation to the icons referred to the second commandment of the Law of Moses:

&quot;You shall not make for yourself a carved image any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down (προσκυνήσεις) to them nor serve (λατρεύσῃς) them. For I, the  your God, am a jealous God.&quot;

One defender of proskynesis in relation to icons was John of Damascus. He wrote &quot;Three Treatises on the Divine Images&quot; in defense of the icons, in which he described several kinds of proskynesis. The first kind is the proskynesis of latreia (λατρεία), which people give to God, who alone is adorable by nature. John believed that only the first kind of proskynesis associated with latreia was forbidden by God. Other kinds of proskynesis: proskynesis performed in relation to saints and images of them (icons) are permitted by God.

In Christian theology, proskynesis denotes that simple veneration which is also permitted to saints, icons, etc., as opposed to latreia (worship), which is due only to triune God. Different authors translate the Greek word &quot;προσκύνησις&quot; from Christian texts into English differently: adoration, worship, veneration, bow, reverence.

&quot;Greetings and respected proskynesis&quot; (; ) for icons was established by the Second Council of Nicaea (Seventh Ecumenical Council) in 787.

==In the Book of Mormon==
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, proskynesis occurs in a number of the narratives in the Book of Mormon.

<text>The Heart of Chicago 1967–1998 Volume II is the sixth greatest hits album, and twenty-fourth album overall, by American rock band Chicago, released in 1998. As the sequel to 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Heart of Chicago 1967–1997&quot;, this edition also features a mixture of songs from Chicago&#x27;s entire 30-year career to date.

As with the first edition, &quot;The Heart of Chicago 1967–1998 Volume II&quot; is noted for containing two exclusive new songs. &quot;All Roads Lead to You&quot; and &quot;Show Me a Sign&quot; were both produced by Roy Bittan of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band.

Released in May 1998, &quot;The Heart of Chicago 1967–1998 Volume II&quot; was not as successful as its predecessor, peaking only at #154 in the US. Both editions of &quot;The Heart of Chicago&quot; are comparable to Rhino Records&#x27; 2002 two-CD package &quot;The Very Best of Chicago: Only the Beginning&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Aspro&quot; (SS/AGSS-309), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the aspro, a fish found abundantly in the upper Rhône River. According to legend, the aspro comes to the surface only in bad weather, when other fishes take refuge near the bottom. This trait gave rise to its nickname, &quot;Sorcerer.&quot;

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Aspro&quot; was laid down on 27 December 1942 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 7 April 1943; sponsored by Mrs. William L. Freseman; and commissioned on 31 July 1943.

==World War II==

&quot;Aspro&quot; held shakedown training in the waters off Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Newport, Rhode Island; and New London, Connecticut. After completing her tests and trial runs, she sailed on 17 September for Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 October and immediately began preparations for her first war patrol which would take her to waters around Formosa and Sakishima Gunto.

=== First war patrol, November 1943 – January 1944 ===
She departed Hawaii on 24 November and made a brief fuel stop at Midway Atoll on 28 November before proceeding to her assigned area. On 15 December, she spotted a Japanese convoy consisting of one tanker, two freighters, and two escorts. The submarine fired torpedoes at the tanker and claimed a hit, but apparently failed to inflict serious damage.

Her next chance came on the night of 17–18 December, when she spotted a convoy of 15 Japanese ships. At 22:26, &quot;Aspro&quot; fired her stern tubes at a large tanker and an adjacent freighter. The submarine then made an end around run and attacked again. She claimed to have witnessed three vessels sinking, one severely crippled ship being taken under tow, and two other vessels having been damaged. &quot;Aspro&quot; escaped counterattack by the Japanese destroyer . With only one torpedo left, she returned to Midway on 1 January 1944, terminating her patrol after 39 days at sea. Postwar analysis failed to substantiate any of the sinkings, crediting her with damaging fleet tankers &quot;Sarawak Maru&quot; and &quot;Tenei Maru&quot;.

During the course of the patrol, Stevenson had noticed his eyesight was growing progressively weaker. Therefore, after arriving at Midway, he underwent an eye examination and was disqualified for sea duty. He then suggested that his brother, Lt. Comdr. William A. Stevenson, relieve him. This recommendation was approved, and the change took place on 15 January 1944.

=== Second war patrol, January – March 1944 ===
Following a refit &quot;Aspro&quot; departed Midway on 15 January and proceeded to Pearl Harbor to undergo brief training before heading back to Midway on 3 February en route to her second patrol. This assignment took her to an area north of Truk, as part of Operation Hailstone. On 15 February at 11:21, she spotted a large Japanese submarine, which was later identified as . After a long surface pursuit, &quot;Aspro&quot; drew within range of &quot;I-43&quot;, and at 22:23 fired four torpedoes. Her crew saw and heard an explosion, followed shortly by another. They then saw her target&#x27;s bow rise as the victim sank by her stern at . This was &quot;Aspro&quot;″s first confirmed sinking.

On 17 February, she underwent a depth charge attack, but suffered no damage. &quot;Aspro&quot; torpedoed a freighter on 4 March, and the subsequent explosion shook the submarine violently. However, the Japanese vessel was merely damaged, not sunk. The rest of this patrol passed uneventfully, and &quot;Aspro&quot; retired to Pearl Harbor on 28 March after 54 days at sea.

=== Third war patrol, April – June 1944 ===
&quot;Aspro&quot; carried out her third patrol near the Palau Islands. After refitting she got underway on 22 April and headed west. Following a brief stop at Midway for supplies four days later, she continued on to waters around the Palau Islands. On 14 May, the submarine encountered a convoy of two freighters protected by three escorts. At 05:54, she fired a spread of torpedoes at one freighter and, one and one-half hours later, saw the damaged ship lying dead in the water and sinking by the stern. At the end of two hours of intermittent observation, this ship later disappeared from sight. The next day, &quot;Aspro&quot; attacked one of the escorts of the same convoy and heard one explosion. The submarine&#x27;s crew watched from the bridge as the target sank. &quot;Aspro&quot; remained on patrol for another month before reaching Fremantle, Western Australia, on 16 June. There, she was officially credited with sinking one ship and assisting in destroying another for a total loss of 8,650 tons of Japanese shipping. {15 May 1944 the Sinking ship &quot;Jokuja Maru&quot; 6,440 tons was sunk at 10.10N 131.25E}

=== Fourth war patrol, July – August 1944 ===
The submarine spent two weeks undergoing a refit before beginning her fourth patrol on 9 July. After pausing at Darwin, Northern Territory on 16 July to top off her fuel tanks, she proceeded to the South China Sea. Shortly thereafter, on 19 July, &quot;Aspro&quot; found a convoy of four medium-sized ships in company with five escort vessels off the west coast of Luzon and fired her torpedoes at 05:45 and heard a series of explosions. As a result of this, she claimed to have sunk one ship and damaged a second. The next day, the submarine fired torpedoes at a member of a three-ship convoy, but all apparently missed.

On 28 July, &quot;Aspro&quot; sighted an anchored ship flying a Japanese flag and launched a spread of torpedoes. The submarine heard three explosions, and her target emitted heavy smoke amidships and began listing to starboard and settling by the bow. The vessel became a mass of flames, and her fires continued to rage as &quot;Aspro&quot; withdrew from the area. A week later, she encountered the moored ship again – hard aground, listing to starboard, and completely gutted by fire. Two large holes in the hull at the waterline were visible. {This was the transport &quot;Peking Maru&quot; of 2,288 tons at 17.33N 120.21E}

On 6 August, the submarine spotted two Japanese freighters and opened fire at 10:16. One of these ships was later seen to be listing 15 degrees to port, but still underway. The next day, &quot;Aspro&quot; attacked a 12-ship convoy. Her torpedoes hit a large freighter which sagged in the middle and started to settle. Following this action, &quot;Aspro&quot; continued her patrol uneventfully before returning to Fremantle on 18 August.

=== Fifth war patrol, September – October 1944 ===
On 10 September, &quot;Aspro&quot; sailed for her fifth patrol which took her back to the South China Sea. While still in transit to the patrol area, she found her first targets on 30 September off the northeast coast of Luzon where she met a convoy of seven or eight vessels protected by four escorts. She torpedoed and heavily damaged a freighter. Two days later, she attacked a tanker and heard breaking-up noises for 10–15 minutes. Through her periscope, she saw her victim listing to starboard with her bow high in the air. Soon &quot;Aspro&quot; lost sight of the ship and claimed to have sunk her. About an hour later, &quot;Aspro&quot; attacked another freighter in the same convoy. The ship was seen sinking in a vertical dive, stern first. {The 2 Oct 1944 credit was the cargo &quot;Azuchisan Maru&quot; of 6,888 tons at 18.25M 120.32E}

Following this action, &quot;Aspro&quot; rendezvoused with and to form a wolf pack. On 7 October, &quot;Hoe&quot; spotted a large convoy consisting of about a dozen ships. At 04:55, &quot;Aspro&quot; fired four torpedoes at a freighter and witnessed the ship&#x27;s sinking. {This was the Passenger-cargo &quot;Macassar Maru&quot; of 4,026 tons at 17.54N 119.57E}. Shortly thereafter, she terminated her patrol at Saipan on 14 October and then proceeded to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 25 October.

=== Sixth war patrol, November 1944 – February 1945 ===
&quot;Aspro&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 21 November and headed for Saipan. On 28 November, her No. 1 main generator threw a banding wire off the rotor, necessitating a replacement of the armature. Such repairs required her return to Pearl Harbor. 
After a week&#x27;s work there, &quot;Aspro&quot; got underway on 13 December for her sixth war patrol. She was assigned lifeguard duties west of Taiwan to support carrier strikes for the week of 3 January 1945. While on her station, she attacked the amphibious assault ship Shintsu Maru. Two torpedoes hit and sank this target.

Her only other torpedo attack during the patrol occurred on 6 January, when she fired on two small freighters but missed. Her most important accomplishment of the patrol – which ended at Pearl Harbor on 11 February 1945 – was her rescue of four downed American aviators.
She was under the command of James H. Ashley, Jr. (class of 1934, USNA) who received the Navy Cross for this mission.

=== Seventh war patrol, June – August 1945 ===
Following this patrol, &quot;Aspro&quot; left Hawaii bound for the California coast. She entered Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard on 20 February and spent the next three months undergoing overhaul. This work ended on 31 May, and she sailed for Pearl Harbor to resume her combat duties.

Her seventh and final patrol began on 25 June and covered waters south of the Japanese home islands. On 8 July, she was assigned lifeguard duties in support of planes that had taken off from Iwo Jima for strikes on military targets in Japan. Beginning 20 July, she shifted position to cover carrier-based strikes against southeastern Honshū. Five days later, the submarine attacked and claimed to have sunk a Japanese tug with her final torpedo spread of the war.

On 3 August, she carried out a daring rescue of a downed aviator. &quot;Aspro&quot; entered Sagami Wan and came within five to six miles of the Japanese mainland to retrieve the pilot. Despite repeated Japanese air attacks, she succeeded in saving the American. Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Freeman USN (1922–2014) jumped into the waters after shooting down one of the Japanese bombers attacking the &quot;Aspro&quot; realizing the submarine was in the process of submerging during Japanese bomber attacks. After 2 hours she surfaced and picked up the wounded pilot and seaman. For his &quot;Conspicuous Gallantry&quot; Freeman was awarded a Silver Star and a Purple Heart for wounds he received.

Her patrol ended on 13 August, when she moored at Midway to commence a refit. It was here that &quot;Aspro&quot; received word of the Japanese capitulation which ended the war. On 1 September &quot;Aspro&quot; departed Midway, bound for the California coast. She arrived at San Francisco on 11 September for preservation work prior to being placed out of commission on 30 January 1946 and entering the Pacific Reserve Fleet in the Mare Island berthing area.

== Post-War service ==

&quot;Aspro&quot; was recommissioned on 6 July 1951 and, for the next two years, operated out of San Diego, her new home port, and performed routine work along the west coast. On 9 November 1953, she was placed in a reserve status and was berthed with the Mare Island group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. &quot;Aspro&quot; was decommissioned on 30 April 1954.

The submarine was placed back in commission on 4 May 1957. She completed shakedown and was accepted into the active fleet on 8 June. She resumed her services to various units stationed along the west coast. This routine was broken first by the 1959 movie &quot;Battle of the Coral Sea&quot;, starring Cliff Robertson, which was shot in part aboard &quot;Aspro&quot;, then by a deployment to the western Pacific in mid-1959.

Upon her return to San Diego on 22 January 1960, &quot;Aspro&quot; underwent overhaul. On 1 July 1960, &quot;Aspro&quot; was redesignated AGSS-309. She then resumed her services along the west coast. On 7 September 1962, &quot;Aspro&quot; was decommissioned, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 9 October 1962. She was later sunk as a target by off San Diego, California on 16 November 1962.

==Awards==
&quot;Aspro&quot; won seven battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Burkhard Earl of Geisenhausen was the first margrave in the Bavarian &quot;marchia orientalis&quot;, the territory that was to become the March of Austria, after its recapture at the 955 Battle of Lechfeld.

When German king Otto I had defeated the Magyars, the &quot;marchia&quot; was re-established in the conquered territories and put under the command of Burkhard, a brother-in-law of Duchess Judith, Duchess of Bavaria. As he had joined the uprising of Duke Henry II of Bavaria against Emperor Otto II, he was deposed at the Reichstag of Regensburg in 976, when the territory was given to Leopold of Babenberg.

From 970 to 972 Burkhard was multiple mentioned as Margrave of marchia orientalis. He is also considered the father of Bishop Henry I of Augsburg.

Burkhard&#x27;s residence at marchia orientalis was probalbly at Poechlarn, this connects him in context with Rüdiger of Bechelaren (The song of the Nibelungs).

The German name for Austria was only first mentioned as &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; in a famous document of 996.

<text>The International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC) is a unique identifier for musical works, similar to ISBN for books. It is adopted as international standard ISO 15707. The ISO subcommittee with responsibility for the standard is TC 46/SC 9.

== Format ==
Each code is composed of three parts:
# prefix element (1 character)
# work identifier (9 digits)
# check digit (1 digit)

Currently, the only prefix defined is &quot;T&quot;, indicating Musical works. However, additional prefixes may be defined in the future to expand the available range of identifiers and/or expand the system to additional types of works.

===Computation of the check digit===

With
* formula_1: one of the nine digits of the work identifier (i=1 to 9) from left to right.
* formula_2: check digit.

formula_3

formula_4

====Example: T-034.524.680-C====

formula_5

formula_6

ISWC identifiers are commonly written the form &quot;T-123.456.789-C&quot;. The grouping is for ease of reading only; the numbers do not incorporate any information about the work&#x27;s region, author, publisher, etc. Rather, they are simply issued in sequence. These separators are not required, and no other separators are allowed.

The first ISWC was assigned in 1995, for the song &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; by ABBA; the code is T-000.000.001-0.

== Usage ==
To register an ISWC, the following minimal information must be supplied:
* title
* names of all composers, arrangers and authors, with their role in the piece (identified by role code) and their CAE/IPI number
* work classification code (CIS)
* identification of other works it is a derivative of

Note: an ISWC identifies works, not recordings. ISRC can be used to identify recordings. Nor does it identify individual publications (e.g. issues of a recording on physical media, sheet music, broadcast at a particular frequency/modulation/time/location...)

Its primary purpose is in collecting society administration, and to clearly identify works in legal contracts. It would also be useful in library cataloguing.

Due to the fact that a musical work can have multiple authors, it is inevitable that, on rare occasions, a duplicate ISWC might exist and might not be detected immediately. Because of the existing business practices among collecting societies, it is not possible to simply declare an ISWC as obsolete. In such cases, as soon as they are identified, the system will deal with duplicate registrations by linking such registration records in the ISWC database and its related products.

<doc id="1116527" wikidata="Q5134779" url="?curid=1116527" title="Clock Face, St Helens">
<text>Clock Face is a village and area of the town of St Helens, England, south of the town centre. It is a ward within the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens and forms part of the parish of Bold.

Historically a part of Lancashire, the village and area is so named because of a large clock face that adorned the Inn. The name was also adopted by a colliery in the area. The Clock Face public house, although not the original building, is built close to the original location and maintains the naming tradition.

Clock Face is home to the amateur rugby league side Clock Face Miners, originally established in 1921 as &#x27;Clock Face Rangers&#x27;. The club colours are yellow and blue.

==Industry==
The area was an important coal mining village with three collieries in the vicinity, including Clock Face Colliery (which was closed in 1966), Sutton Manor Colliery (which was closed in 1991), and Parkside Colliery, which was closed in 1992, following a lengthy NUM-linked sit-in protest, as the last deep mine in the Lancashire Coalfield.

Clock Face Country Park is situated on the site of one of the former collieries. In the late 1990s, the site was reclaimed by St Helens Council as a public open space. It contains developing woodlands, meadow areas and a fishing pond leased to a local angling club. The former mineral railway route has been reclaimed as a pathway to Sutton Manor Woodlands.

==Transportation==
Clock Face was once served by the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway at Clock Face station on Gartons Lane. The area is currently served by Lea Green railway station on the northern route of the Liverpool to Manchester Line. Arriva North West operate bus services in Clock Face, routes 32/32A, 30 and 33 link the area to St Helens Hospital and the Town Centre. Other bus companies serving the area include Merseytravel&#x27;s 140 bus route and Halton Transport&#x27;s 17/17B bus routes. Arriva have since taken over some 17 bus routes to Widnes as part of a scheme to boost travel between both Widnes and St Helens.

<text>The Coronation Cup was a one-off football tournament to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, between four English and four Scottish clubs, held in Glasgow in May 1953. This tournament, like the Empire Exhibition Trophy, was held in very high regard by football clubs, as at the time it allowed teams to test themselves against teams from another country in the days before European football.

Celtic and Hibernian met in the final at Hampden Park, Celtic coming out the winners 2–0 before 117,000 spectators. Celtic&#x27;s victory meant that they became the unofficial champions of Britain.

<doc id="1116542" wikidata="Q901481" url="?curid=1116542" title="Damon and Pythias">
<text>The story of Damon (; , gen. Δάμωνος) and Pythias (; 
or
; or Phintias, ) is a legend in Greek historic writings illustrating the Pythagorean ideal of friendship. Pythias is accused of and charged with plotting against the tyrannical Dionysius I of Syracuse. Pythias is sentenced to death, but requests of Dionysius to first be allowed to settle his affairs. Dionysius agrees, on the condition that Pythias&#x27; friend, Damon, be held hostage and, should Pythias not return, be executed in his stead. When Pythias returns, Dionysius, amazed by the love and trust in their friendship, frees them both.

== Greek legend ==

As told by Aristoxenus, and after him Cicero (&quot;De Offic.&quot; 3.45), Diodorus Siculus (10.4), and others, Pythias and his friend Damon, both followers of the philosopher Pythagoras, traveled to Syracuse during the reign of the tyrant Dionysius I (r. 405–367 BC). Pythias was accused of plotting against the tyrant and sentenced to death.

Accepting his sentence, Pythias asked to be allowed to return home one last time to settle his affairs and bid his family farewell. Not wanting to be taken for a fool, the king refused, believing that, once released, Pythias would flee and never return. Damon offered himself as a hostage in Pythias&#x27; absence, and when the king insisted that, should Pythias not return by an appointed time, Damon would be executed in his stead, Damon agreed and Pythias was released.

Dionysius was convinced that Pythias would never return, and as the day Pythias promised to return came and went, he called for Damon&#x27;s execution—but just as the executioner was about to kill Damon, Pythias returned.

Apologizing to his friend for the delay, Pythias explained that on the passage back to Syracuse, pirates had captured his ship and had thrown him overboard, but that he had swum to shore and made his way back to Syracuse as quickly as possible, arriving just in time to save his friend.

So astonished by and pleased with their friendship, Dionysius pardoned both men. It was also said that the tyrant then sought to become their third friend, but was denied.

Another version says that it was a test planned by the king and his courtiers. The Pythagoreans were renowned for their moral strength and superiority, but some Syracusan courtiers argued the claim was false, and others disagreed, so with their king they devised a test—a crisis that would show whether two Pythagoreans lived up to that reputation.

== Works based on the legend==

*In 1564, the material was made into a tragicomic play by the English poet Richard Edwardes (&quot;Damon and Pythias&quot;).
*The best-known modern treatment of the legend is the German ballad &quot;Die Bürgschaft&quot;, written in 1799 by Friedrich Schiller, based on the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot; version. (In this work, Damon is sentenced to death, not Pythias.)
*In 1821, the Irish poet John Banim wrote a play based on the legend (&quot;Damon and Pythias&quot;). Familiarity with this play led Justus H. Rathbone to found the fraternal order Knights of Pythias.
*In 1914 in the United States, Universal Pictures produced and released the film &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; starring William Worthington and Herbert Rawlinson in the title roles.
*In 1915, the book &quot;The Story of Damon and Pythias&quot; by Albert Payson Terhune was published. It was &quot;adapted and illustrated from the photo-play conceived and produced by The Universal Film Manufacturing Company&quot;, referring to the 1914 film starring William Worthington and Herbert Rawlinson. This book, like the German ballad, casts Damon as the condemned and the one who must return in time to save Pythias.
*In 1925, William Faulkner published &quot;Damon and Pythias Unlimited&quot; in the New Orleans &quot;Double Dealer,&quot; one of several &quot;sketches&quot; he wrote for the paper when he moved there.
*In Japan, the 1940 short story &quot;Run, Melos!&quot; by Osamu Dazai and an earlier nursery tale by Miekichi Suzuki are based on the legend, as is a 1992 anime produced by Toei Company, Ltd.
*The short story &quot;Pythias&quot; by Frederik Pohl, published in 1955, entwines the mythic elements with modern political and psychokinetic concerns.
*The film &quot;The Delicate Delinquent&quot; (1957) features characters &quot;Mike Damon&quot; (Darren McGavin, but imagined for Dean Martin) and &quot;Sidney Pythias&quot; (Jerry Lewis). As released, the film only vaguely resembles the legend — Pythias avoids jail — but intends instead to be a testament to the Martin and Lewis friendship.
*In a 1959 &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; episode, Beaver&#x27;s father relates the Damon and Pythias story and Beaver donates his homework to friend Larry to prove their friendship. Larry confesses moments before Beaver loses a week of recesses.
*The 1962 MGM film &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; remains true to the ancient story; it stars Guy Williams as Damon and Don Burnett as Pythias.
* The 1966 adventure film &quot;Adventure in Kigan Castle&quot;, which was adapted loosely from &quot;Run, Melos!&quot;, has Osumi (Toshiro Mifune), a soldier of fortune, promise to deliver holy manuscripts from Gandhara while Ensai, a monk who freed him from slavery at the beginning of the film, offers to be executed in his place. Osumi succeeds and the king calls off the execution when he sees how selfless the man is. 
*The Dreamworks animated film &quot;&quot; (2003) features the title character going on a journey to find a treasure, while his best friend remains behind in Syracuse to be executed in his place should he fail to return; he comes back and both are saved.
*The story is reproduced in an episode of the animated series &quot;Mythic Warriors: Guardians of the Legend&quot;.

==Idiomatic use==
&quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; came to be an idiomatic expression for &quot;true friendship.&quot;

* Denis Diderot&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Two Friends from Bourbonne&quot; (1770), begins: &quot;There used to be two men here who might be called the Damon and Pythias of Bourbonne.&quot; 
* In &quot;The Small House at Allington&quot; (1864) by Anthony Trollope, the Countess De Courcy teases the young Adolphus Crosbie for a long stay in the country with his friend Bernard Dale by remarking, &quot;Quite a case of Damon and Pythias.&quot; 
* The canines Bummer and Lazarus were eulogized as &quot;the Damon and Pythias of San Francisco&quot; upon Bummer&#x27;s death in 1865. 
* In Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, Henry Jekyll&#x27;s two oldest friends, Dr. Lanyon and Mr. Utterson (a lawyer), have an exchange while discussing Dr. Jekyll&#x27;s apparent self-imposed isolation. In the discussion (below), the use of the Damon-and-Pythias idiom would seem to indicate that, whether the difference was on a point of science or something else, it was not &quot;only&quot; some trivial difference:
...said Utterson. &quot;I thought you had a common bond of interest&quot;.

&quot;We had&quot;, was the reply. &quot;But it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in the mind... Such unscientific balderdash&quot;, said the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, &quot;would have estranged Damon and Pythias&quot;.

This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson. &quot;They have only differed on some point of science&quot;, he thought...

* Chapter Two (titled &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot;) of Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s 1869 novel &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; tells of the friendship of Frederick Moreau and Charles Deslauriers.
* The 1889 novel &quot;A Marriage Below Zero&quot; by Alfred J. Cohen (pen name: Alan Dale) has a young gay couple continually referring to themselves as Damon and Pythias. Soon the upscale social world that they try pass in begins to refer to them with the same term, but as a derogatory codeword for &#x27;gay couple.&#x27;
* Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet addresses his close friend Horatio as &quot;O Damon dear.&quot;
* In the novel &quot;Little Men&quot; by Louisa M. Alcott (1871), Chapter 14 is entitled &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot;. This is a reference to two of the characters, Nat and Dan. Early in the book, Nat is responsible for introducing Dan to the school which is the setting of the novel. Later, when Nat is falsely accused of theft, Dan stands by him and then later takes responsibility for the theft himself, saying that he could bear the mistrust and anger of the other boys more easily than his weaker friend. In fact, neither boy is guilty, and they are later cleared of involvement.
* Two clerks arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct in Charles Dickens&#x27;s story &quot;Making a Night of It&quot; (in &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;) allude to Damon and Pythias.
* In &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot;, by John Hersey, Captain Purvis&#x27;s and Mayor Joppolo&#x27;s friendship is compared to the friendship of Damon and Pythias because they dated sisters.
* In 1895, Jack London used Damon and Pythias as the nicknames of the two main characters in &quot;Who Believes in Ghosts!&quot;
* In the 1940 movie &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) remarks, with great irony, that C. K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) and George Kittredge (John Howard) are just like Damon and Pythias.
* During World War II, P-51 fighter pilots Major Dominic Salvatore Gentile (1920–1951) and his wingman Captain John T. Godfrey (1922–1958), both of the 4th Fighter Group, were referred to as &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot;. This remarkable team destroyed over 50 German aircraft.
* In the 1950 Bowery Boys movie &quot;Blonde Dynamite&quot;, the boys establish a male escort service out of their foil Louie&#x27;s ice cream parlor while they have conveniently sent him to Coney Island on vacation; Slip Mahoney (Leo Gorcey) tells the other boys to &quot;Let Damon and Pythias fight it out!&quot;—meaning to let Sach (Huntz Hall) and Whitey (Billy Benedict) fight to see which would be included in a group date with a bevy of femmes fatale.
* Jim Kjelgaard&#x27;s 1957 novel &quot;Double Challenge&quot; names two trophy whitetail bucks as Damon and Pythias in the rurals of Pennsylvania.
* In season 2, episode 32 (aired May 7, 1959) of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, &quot;Friendship&quot;, Ward Cleaver uses it as a reference to his sons, due to Beaver having an argument with his friend Larry Mondello.
* In the 1971 P. G. Wodehouse novel &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;, Bertie Wooster tells his Aunt Dahlia that at Oxford, his friendship with Ginger Winship was comparable to that of Damon and Pythias. It is not the author&#x27;s only usage of the reference, as it crops up when introducing the central characters of his 1919 story &quot;A Woman Is Only a Woman&quot;, whose friendship is compared to them as well.
* In Episode 8, season 1 of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, a character describes his friendship for the murder victim by saying that people referred to them as &quot;Damon and what&#x27;s-his-name.&quot;
* In a 1997 episode of the TV series &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;A Modern Prometheus,&quot; a character portraying Lord Byron mentions Damon and Pythias before he jumps with another man to their &quot;death.&quot;
* In Season 9, Episode 22 of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Admissions&quot;, ADA Carmichael used the reference to describe the relationship between two graduate students who were covering each other in the murder of a fellow female student.
* In the Anthony Trollope novel &quot;The Three Clerks&quot;, when two of the clerks have a falling out he says, &quot;Damon and Pythias [were] no longer; that war waged between them.&quot;
* In the western movie &quot;Showdown&quot; (1973), Childhood friends Billy Massey (Dean Martin) and Chuck Jarvis (Rock Hudson) go in opposite directions after Chuck ends up married to Billy&#x27;s former sweetheart, Kate (Susan Clark). Billy becomes a train robber, Chuck a sheriff. But they end up joining forces against common enemies in a final SHOWDOWN. A series of life circumstances put two close childhood friends pitted against each other. The seemingly inevitable ending takes a twist that allows the friendship to continue after Billy commits an act of bravery that he knows is suicidal but saves Chuck&#x27;s life. Kate (Susan Clark) refers to Chuck and Billy&#x27;s friendship as that of Damon and Pythias.

<doc id="1116543" wikidata="Q5470426" url="?curid=1116543" title="Forrest, Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Forrest (postcode: 2603) is a suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Forrest is named after Sir John Forrest, an explorer, legislator, federalist, Premier of Western Australia, and one of the fathers of the Australian Constitution. Streets in Forrest are named after explorers and governors. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Forrest is the second most Socio-Economic advantaged location in Australia after the neighbouring suburb of Barton.

Forrest is one of the few suburbs in Canberra built to the original Canberra plans. It contains many circular and geometric patterns in its streets and can be quite confusing to drive in. Forrest was renamed from the earlier suburb Blandfordia (the name of the Christmas Bell) and gazetted as a suburb in 1928.
South Blandfordia became part of the new suburb of Griffith at the same time.

The original residents of Forrest were mostly senior public servants who were moved from Melbourne.

== Demography ==

In the , the population of Forrest was 1,827; 0.4% were Indigenous and 72.1% were born in Australia. 36.5% of dwellings were separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.3%), 16.9% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.6%) and 46.6% were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 14.2%). 42.5% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 24.0%. 20.5% worked in central government administration, compared to the Australian average of 1.1% and the Canberra-wide average of 17.1%. The median weekly personal income for people aged 15 years and over was $1,816, compared to the median Australian income of $805. The weekly median family income was $4,532, as compared to the Australian weekly median family income of $2,120. 

== Education ==

Forrest Primary School is situated in Hobart Avenue in Forrest. It caters for students in years P-6. The students wear red and yellow. The school celebrated its fiftieth anniversary on 4 April 2008.

Forrest residents get preference for:
*Forrest Primary
*Telopea Park School (for high school)
*Narrabundah College

== Suburb amenities ==
The suburb includes part of the Manuka shopping centre. The suburb also contains a government run primary school.

Forrest together with the eastern part of Deakin and the northern part of Red Hill (sometimes called &quot;old Deakin&quot; and &quot;old Red Hill&quot;), represent the most prestigious residential area in Canberra. Most of the area is detached dwellings in which a 1600 m2 block would be on the small side, and 2000 m2 blocks are not atypical.

== Notable places ==

Forrest includes several areas that are listed by the ACT Heritage Council, covering most of the suburb:
*The Blandfordia 4 Precinct, bounded by Arthur Circle, Moresby Street, Mugga Way, Melbourne Avenue and Empire Circuit, which was developed as three separate residential subdivisions between 1926 and 1965, on Garden City principles.
*The Blandfordia 5 Precinct (this is mostly in Griffith, but includes houses north of Furneaux Street between Arthur Circle and Bougainville Street), the first stage of which was developed in 1926 and 1927 to meet the urgent need for housing for public servants for the opening of the provisional Parliament House in Canberra in 1927. It was planned by Sir John Sulman (and departs from Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s intent for the area) and the planting was guided by Thomas Charles Weston.
*The Forrest Housing Precinct (bounded by National Circuit, Hobart Avenue, Arthur Circuit, Empire Circuit and Melbourne Avenue), a Garden City precinct that was mostly developed in 1926 and 1927.
*The Forrest Fire Station Precinct, bounded by Canberra Avenue, Empire Circuit, Manuka Circle and Fitzroy Street, which was built in 1938.
*Manning Clark&#x27;s house, 11 Tasmania Circle, which was designed by Robin Boyd and is an early example of the Boyd Peninsula House design. It was the residence of the historian, Manning Clark.
*The Burns Memorial, which has been a memorial for over 60 years, symbolising the contribution of those of Scottish descent to Australia&#x27;s settlement and development and the loyalty and affection in which Scottish communities in Australia held the poet Robert Burns and Scotland at the time.
*St Christopher&#x27;s Cathedral Precinct, which has been the centre of Catholic worship and education in the Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn since 1928.
*Federal Capital Commission (FCC) Type 15 House, 15 Arthur Circle, which was designed in 1926 and, according to the Heritage Council, &quot;comprises the only example of a Federal Capital Commission (FCC) Type 15 residence to have been built in Canberra, being rare as both as a two-storey residence and demonstrating the architectural style of the English Arts and Crafts movement&quot;. It is one of four houses of the type that were designed by FCC architects under the influence of Charles Voysey, but the others have been substantially altered.
*St Andrew&#x27;s Church Precinct, which was opened in 1934 and is one of the largest and most ornate Inter-War Gothic style buildings in the ACT. It has stained glass windows by Norman Carter and John Radecki.
*Free Serbian Orthodox Church, 32 National Circuit, is, according to the Heritage Council, &quot;a successful modern reminder of traditional Serbian church planning.&quot; Its murals, which were produced by one elderly artist over a period of nearly 16 years, are also considered noteworthy.

=== Forrest Housing Precinct ===

The Forrest Housing Precinct is subject to conservation measures to preserve its character. Important values being preserved in the suburb are:
*The majority of the precinct was constructed in 1926 – 27 to meet the urgent need to provide housing for public servants prior to the opening of the provisional Parliament House in 1927.
*The Melbourne firm Oakley, Parkes and Scarborough won a 1924 competition to design the housing for the precinct.
*The street layout is directly derived from Griffin&#x27;s 1913 plan which defined the major axes of Melbourne and Hobart Avenues radiating from Capital Hill and concentric circles. The road layout and subdivision pattern of the precinct is mirrored on the opposite side of Melbourne Avenue.
*The public domain landscaping of the precinct is associated with Thomas Charles Weston, Superintendent of Parks, Gardens and Afforestation, Canberra 1913–1926. Weston&#x27;s use of Australian native species was an unusual practice for this period.
*The precinct is also a repository of a small number of compatible privately built dwellings designed by early local architects including Kenneth H Oliphant, one of Canberra&#x27;s first independent architects. Oliphant&#x27;s work has contributed notably to the character of the urban architecture of Canberra.

=== Street furniture ===

The remnants of street furniture, that is street signs, fire hydrants and footpath lighting and other elements including kerbs and gutters and examples of brick drains, are valued for their contribution to the aesthetic of a twentieth-century &#x27;Garden City&#x27; planned subdivision. The furniture of the Garden City precincts (Blandfordia 4 and 5 and the Forrest Housing precincts) is now protected.

=== Forrest Fire Station Precinct ===

These buildings are in the block bounded by Canberra Avenue, Empire Circuit, Manuka Circle and Fitzroy Street. They were completed in 1938 and include a former fire station. The buildings are considered important examples of Australian Early Modern Architecture and illustrate a distinctive comparison with the &quot;Federal Capital Architecture&quot; that dominated in Canberra in the 1920s and 30s.

=== Tennyson Crescent Christmas lights ===

The Richards&#x27; family home in Tennyson Crescent took out the Guinness World Record for the most lights on a residential property on 4 December 2011. Electricity at the house lights more than half a million Christmas lights. The lighting display opened to visitors, with gold coin donations accepted to raise money for SIDS and Kids ACT.

==Notable people==
Notable people from or who have lived in Forrest include:
* John Cumpston, CMG, first Director-General of the Australia Department of Health
* Harry Wyatt Wunderly, instrumental in the management and reduction of tuberculosis

==Geology==
Mount Painter Volcanics dark grey to green grey dacitic tuff is found in all except the northeast side. There are a few outcrops of sediments in amongst the volcanics containing shale and sandstone. On the northeast a patch of Ordovician Pittman Formation greywacke outcrops along Canberra Avenue. Black Mountain Sandstone is near St Andrew&#x27;s church in the north north east. Canberra Formation, calcareous shale is found in the north. The Deakin Fault runs from State Circle to Manuka separating the Mount Painter Volcanics from the other sediments.

<doc id="1116545" wikidata="Q3978136" url="?curid=1116545" title="Al-Mu'awwidhatayn">
<text>Al-Mu&#x27;awwidhatayn (Arabic: المعوذتين), an Arabic expression meaning &quot;The Two Protectors&quot; or &quot;The Two Protective Incantations&quot;, refers to the final two surahs (chapters) of the Quran: 113 (Al-Falaq) and 114 (Al-Nas). They are called by this name because of their use of the term &quot;ʿādhā&quot; (meaning &quot;protection&quot; or &quot;refuge&quot;) in a phrase that occurs in both surahs: ʿ&quot;qul aʿūdhu bi-rabbi al- ... min ...&quot; (&quot;Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of ... from/against ... &quot;). Likewise, the two surahs appear consecutively in the Qur&#x27;an, are both very short, and bear additional stylistic resemblances with one another, broadly functioning as incantations that appeal to God&#x27;s protection from evils or ailments. Some in the Islamic tradition have claimed that the two surahs were also revealed at the same time to Muhammad. 

Some scholars have argued that the content and style of the Al-Mu&#x27;awwidhatayn is &quot;wholly different&quot; from the rest of that in the Quran. Relatedly, the placement of the Al-Mu&#x27;awwidhatayn in the Quran appears to have been disputed in the earliest years of Islam, as these two surahs, along with Surah Al-Fatihah (the first chapter of the Uthmanic codex used today), are absent from the codex of Ibn Mas&#x27;ud, one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions. Their inclusion may have reflected the mission of the Uthmanic committee to a fully canonical text.

== Text ==
=== Al-Falaq ===

# Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of Daybreak.
# From the evil of what He created.
# And from the evil of the darkness as it gathers.
# And from the evil of those who practice sorcery.
# And from the evil of an envious when he envies.”

=== Al-Nas ===

# Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind.
# The King of mankind.
# The God of mankind.
# From the evil of the sneaky whisperer.
# Who whispers into the hearts of people.
# From among jinn and among people.”

== Style and genre ==
The genre of these surahs has been described as prophylactic incantations, meant to ward off evil, and to be recited in a private as opposed to a public domain. One stylistic feature of the Al-Mu&#x27;awwidhatayn, shared only in Surah 1 and Surah 109 elsewhere in the Quran, is the use of the first-person human voice throughout the entire surah. To the exclusion of Surah 109, however, these three surahs are more closely grouped by that the first-person singular is structured as a prayer towards God. Like Surah 112, the Al-Mu&#x27;awwidhatayn also begin with the formula &quot;Say!&quot; (&quot;kul&quot;). Only in the Mu&#x27;awwidhatayn, however, this is followed by the expression &quot;I seek refuge in the Lord&quot; (&quot;aʿūdhu birabbi&quot;), which also appears as a common near eastern formula outside of the Quran. The surahs proceed with an enunciation of ailments from which God is appealed to for protection from.

Though there are important structural similarities between the two surahs, there are also important stylistic differences, especially thematically and lexically:

* While Surah 113 has end-rhyme, often focusing on the assonance of the &quot;q&quot;-root in the first four of the five end-words in the surah, Surah 114 focuses on the use of the same word entirely (&quot;nās&quot;) at the end of all six lines but one.

* A much greater-use of the phrase &quot;from the evil of&quot; in Surah 113, where it appears three times, versus only one in Surah 114.
* Three referents to God&#x27;s leadership over humanity in Surah 114 (&quot;the Lord of humanity, the King of humanity, the God of humanity&quot;), versus none in Surah 113.
* The focus on evil in Surah 113, versus the focus on the devil in Surah 114.
* There are five words in Surah 113 that occur in no other surah (terms that are known as &quot;hapax legomena&quot;), including: &quot;falaq&quot; (dawn), &quot;ghāsiq&quot; (nightgloom), &quot;waqab&quot; (blots), &quot;naffāthāt&quot; (whispering sorceresses) and &quot;ʿuqad&quot; (talismanic knots). By contrast, only one word occurs in Surah 114 that does not occur anywhere else in the Quran: &quot;khannās&quot; (stealthily).

== Structure ==
The placement of Al-Mu&#x27;awwidhatayn at the end of the Quran has raised questions as to why it appeared there. Historians have put forwards multiple explanations for why this occurred. For Theodor Noldeke and Friedrich Schwally, this occurred due to a superstition that this placement would afford protection to the reciter. Angelika Neuwirth, following and updating the theory of Noldeke and Schwally, argued that the surahs functioned as something akin to a colophon that closed the Quran and helped protect it from profanation.

The placement of these two surahs at the end of the Quran fulfills a broader purpose alongside the placement of Al-Fatihah at the beginning of the Quran: Al-Fatihah formally opens up the Quranic text, whereas these two surahs close it with appeals to divine protection from harm.

Chronologically, Raymond Farrin has placed these passages as having been formulated around the same time as Surah 23 based on stylistic correspondences between the two.

== Historical context ==
Devin J. Stewart has related the content of Al-Mu&#x27;awwidhatayn to pre-Islamic protective charms, typically structured in the form of (1) &quot;I take refuge&quot; (2) &quot;in the Lord of [X], from the evil of [Y]&quot;. Emran El-Badawi has argued that these texts belongs to a tradition of amulets in the form of the performance of apotropaic magic, or magic that is purposed to turn away or ward off evil influences. El-Badawi has observed, for example, that several early manuscripts containing these surahs are small papyrus amulets. El-Badawi compares these surahs to the Greek Amulet of Alexandria, which El-Badawi argues closely resembles their style and syntax, including in the purpose of calling upon God to protect the reciter from demons, spirits and sorcery, alongside several more specific syntactic similarities. 

Giovanni Mazzini has related a sorcerous act involving blowing/spitting from Surah 113:4, referred to by the root &quot;nfṯ&quot;, to a similar violation described with the same root in an earlier Sabaic inscription. The two texts both seek to attain protection from the deity by those who seek to cause harm by this act and may be drawing on beliefs about the nature and threat of magical activities from pre-Islamic Arabia in doing so. Ahmad Al-Jallad has related the reference to cultic whispering in Surah 114:4 to an inscription that requests the aid of a deity in the face of &quot;whisperer&#x27;s mischief&quot;. He also relates the Quranic reference to cultic whispering to wider classical and ancient Near Eastern attestations of this phenomena.

<doc id="1116547" wikidata="Q7169495" url="?curid=1116547" title="Peroxide process">
<text>The peroxide process is a method for the industrial production of hydrazine.

In this process hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidant instead of sodium hypochlorite, which is traditionally used to generate hydrazine. The main advantage of the peroxide process to hydrazine relative to the traditional Olin Raschig process is that it does not coproduce salt. In this respect, the peroxide process is an example of green chemistry. Since many millions of kilograms of hydrazine are produced annually, this method is of both commercial and environmental significance.

==Production==
===Ketazine formation===
In the usual implementation, hydrogen peroxide is used together with acetamide. This mixture does not react with ammonia directly but does so in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone to give the oxaziridine.

Balanced equations for the individual steps are as follows. Imine formation through condensation:
:Me(Et)C=O + NH3 → Me(Et)C=NH + H2O
Oxidation of the imine to the oxaziridine:
:Me(Et)C=NH + H2O2 → Me(Et)CONH + H2O
Condensation of the oxaziridine with a second molecule of ammonia to give the hydrazone:
:Me(Et)CONH + NH3 → Me(Et)C=NNH2 + H2O
The hydrazone then condenses with a second equivalent of ketone to give the ketazine:
:Me(Et)C=O + Me(Et)C=NNH2 → Me(Et)C=NN=C(Et)Me + H2O

Typical process conditions are 50 °C and atmospheric pressure, with a feed mix of H2O2:ketone:NH3 in a molar ratio of about 1:2:4. Methyl ethyl ketone is advantageous to acetone because the resulting ketazine is immiscible in the reaction mixture and can be separated by decantation. A similar process based on benzophenone has also been described.

===Ketazine to hydrazine===
The final stage involves hydrolysis of the purified ketazine:
:Me(Et)C=NN=C(Et)Me + 2 H2O → 2 Me(Et)C=O + N2H4

The hydrolysis of the azine is acid-catalyzed, hence the need to isolate the azine from the initial ammonia-containing reaction mixture. It is also endothermic, and so requires an increase in temperature (and pressure) to shift the equilibrium in favour of the desired products: ketone (which is recycled) and hydrazine hydrate. The reaction is carried out by simple distillation of the azeotrope: typical conditions are a pressure of 8 bar and temperatures of 130 °C at the top of the column and 179 °C at the bottom of the column. The hydrazine hydrate (30–45% aqueous solution) is run off from the base of the column, while the methyl ethyl ketone is distilled off from the top of the column and recycled.

==History==
The peroxide process, also called the Pechiney–Ugine–Kuhlmann process, was developed in the early 1970s by Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann. Originally the process used acetone instead of methyl ethyl ketone. Methyl ethyl ketone is advantageous because the resulting ketazine is immiscible in the reaction mixture and can be separated by decantation. The world&#x27;s largest hydrazine hydrate plant is in Lannemezan in France, producing 17,000 tonnes of hydrazine products per year.

===Bayer ketazine process===
Before invention of the peroxide process, the Bayer ketazine process had been commercialized. In the Bayer process, the oxidation of ammonia by sodium hypochlorite is conducted in the presence of acetone. The process generates the ketazine but also sodium chloride:
:2 Me2CO + 2 NH3 + NaOCl → Me2C=NN=CMe2 + 3 H2O + NaCl
:Me2C=NN=CMe2 + 2 H2O → N2H4 + 2 Me2CO

<doc id="1116553" wikidata="Q1654582" url="?curid=1116553" title="International Standard Audiovisual Number">
<text>International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) is a unique identifier for audiovisual works and related versions, similar to ISBN for books. It was developed within an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) TC46/SC9 working group. ISAN is managed and run by ISAN-IA.

==Overview==
The ISAN standard (ISO standard 15706:2002 &amp; ISO 15706-2) is recommended or required as the audiovisual identifier of choice for producers, studios, broadcasters, Internet media providers and video games publishers who need to encode, track, and distribute video in a variety of formats. It provides a unique, internationally recognized and permanent reference number for each audiovisual work and related versions registered in the ISAN system. The ISO 15706-2 is the ISO standard, an extension to the existing 2002 published standard ISO 15706:2002. The ISO 15706-2 is the Information and documentation ISAN Part 2: Version identifier.

ISO 15706-2:2007 specifies the basic systems and procedures to support the issuance and administration of V-ISANs.

ISAN identifies works throughout their entire life cycle from conception, to production, to distribution and consumption.

ISANs can be incorporated in both digital and physical media, such as theatrical release prints, DVDs, publications, advertising, marketing materials and packaging, as well as licensing contracts to uniquely identify works.

The ISAN identifier is incorporated in many draft and final standards such as AACS in Blu-rays and HD DVDs, DCI, MPEG, DVB, and ATSC. The identifier can be provided under descriptor 13 (0x0D) for &quot;Copyright identification system and reference&quot; within an ITU-T Rec. H.222 or ISO/IEC 13818 program.

==Number format==

The ISAN is a 12 byte block comprising three segments: a 6 byte root, a 2 byte episode or part, and a 4 byte version.

uimsbf: unsigned integer, most significant bit first

A root is assigned to a core work by the ISAN-IA.

If a root has subsequent film parts (i.e., sequels) or television episodes then the root_part is incremented and started at a point defined by the producing studio. (i.e., relates to the production number)

If a root_part has been modified in some way—for example, dubbing, 24/30/25 frame conversions and subtitling the work into other languages—can have different versions. Common uses are when the native North American 30000/1001 frame version is set to one, the 25 frame conversion for PAL compatible markets is set to two.

When the 12 byte ISAN is represented in hexadecimal form it has 24 digits, for example: 000000018947000000000000. However, a printed ISAN designed for human reading always begins with the ISAN label, appears with hyphens to separate the number into more manageable groups of digits, and adds two check characters (alphanumeric) to help identify transcription errors. The resulting number appears as: ISAN 0000-0001-8947-0000-8-0000-0000-D

ISAN-IA has also developed a recommended practice for encoding the ISAN in a two-dimensional barcode 96 pixels square.

An ISAN is a centrally registered and permanently assigned reference number. The work or content it references is identified by a metadata set registered with ISAN-IA. Appointed Registration Agencies and ISAN-IA work together to prevent duplicate assignments of ISANs with the same metadata set. The ISAN metadata set includes the title (original and alternative), cast (director, actors, producer, screenwriter, etc...), type of works (movie, documentary, TV series or entertainment show, sport events, video games, etc...), duration, year of production and dozens of other fields related to the work. This metadata applies to all type of audiovisual works, including their related versions of trailers, excerpts, videos and broadcasts.

The Microsoft High Capacity Color Barcode will be used too.

==ISAN-IA==
ISAN-IA (ISAN International Agency) is a Geneva-based non-profit association, founded in 2003, by AGICOA, CISAC, and FIAPF to run the ISAN standard.

ISAN-IA is in charge of:

*maintaining the ISAN central repository
*implementing, running and managing the ISAN system
*accrediting and appointing the ISAN registration agencies worldwide
*promoting with the help of the registration agencies, the ISAN standard to the audiovisual industry.

<doc id="1116555" wikidata="Q272637" url="?curid=1116555" title="Katherine Dunham">
<text>Katherine Mary Dunham (June 22, 1909 – May 21, 2006) was an African American dancer, choreographer, anthropologist, and social activist. Dunham had one of the most successful dance careers of the 20th century and directed her own dance company for many years. She has been called the &quot;matriarch and queen mother of black dance.&quot;

While a student at the University of Chicago, Dunham also performed as a dancer, ran a dance school and earned an early bachelor&#x27;s degree in anthropology. Receiving a postgraduate academic fellowship, she went to the Caribbean to study the African diaspora, ethnography and local dance. She returned to graduate school and submitted a master&#x27;s thesis to the anthropology faculty. She did not complete the other requirements for that degree, however, as she realized that her professional calling was performance and choreography.

At the height of her career in the 1940s and 1950s, Dunham was renowned throughout Europe and Latin America and was widely popular in the United States. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called her &quot;dancer Katherine the Great.&quot; For almost 30 years she maintained the Katherine Dunham Dance Company, the only self-supported American black dance troupe at that time. Over her long career, she choreographed more than ninety individual dances. Dunham was an innovator in African-American modern dance as well as a leader in the field of dance anthropology, or ethnochoreology. She also developed the Dunham Technique, a method of movement to support her dance works.

==Early life==
Katherine Mary Dunham was born on the 22 of June in 1909 in a Chicago hospital. Her father, Albert Millard Dunham, was a descendant of slaves from West Africa and Madagascar. Her mother, Fanny June Dunham, who, according to Dunham&#x27;s memoir, possessed Indian, French Canadian, English, and probably African ancestry, died when Dunham was four years old. She had an older brother, Albert Jr., with whom she had a close relationship. After her mother died, her father left the children with their aunt Lulu on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. At the time, the South Side of Chicago was experiencing the effects of the Great Migration where Black southerners attempted to escape the Jim Crow South and poverty. Along with the Great Migration, came White flight and her aunt Lulu&#x27;s business suffered and ultimately closed as a result. This led to a custody battle over Katherine and her brother, brought on by their maternal relatives. This meant neither of the children was able to settle into a home for a few years. However, after her father remarried, Albert Sr. and his new wife, Annette Poindexter Dunham, took in Katherine and her brother. The family moved to a predominantly white neighborhood in Joliet, Illinois. There, her father ran a dry-cleaning business.

Dunham became interested in both writing and dance at a young age. In 1921, a short story she wrote when she was 12 years old, called &quot;Come Back to Arizona&quot;, was published in volume 2 of &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book.&quot;

She graduated from Joliet Central High School in 1928, where she played baseball, tennis, basketball, and track; served as vice-president of the French Club, and was on the yearbook staff. In high school she joined the Terpsichorean Club and began to learn a kind of modern dance based on the ideas of Europeans [Émile Jaques-Dalcroze] and [Rudolf von Laban]. At the age of 15, she organized &quot;The Blue Moon Café&quot;, a fundraising cabaret to raise money for Brown&#x27;s Methodist Church in Joliet, where she gave her first public performance. While still a high school student, she opened a private dance school for young black children.

==Academia and anthropology==
After completing her studies at Joliet Junior College in 1928, Dunham moved to Chicago to join her brother, Albert, at the University of Chicago.

During her time in Chicago, Dunham enjoyed holding social gatherings and inviting visitors to her apartment. Such visitors included ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax, novelist and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston, Robert Redfield, Bronisław Malinowski, A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, Fred Eggan, and many others that she met in and around the University of Chicago.
After noticing that Katherine enjoyed working and socializing with people, her brother suggested that she study Anthropology. University of Chicago&#x27;s anthropology department was fairly new and the students were still encouraged to learn aspects of sociology, distinguishing it from other anthropology departments in the US that focused almost exclusively on non-Western peoples. The Anthropology department at Chicago in the 1930s and 40s has been described as holistic, interdisciplinary, with a philosophy of liberal humanism, and principles of racial equality and cultural relativity.

Dunham officially joined the department in 1929 as an anthropology major, while studying dances of the African diaspora. As a student, she studied under anthropologists such as A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, Edward Sapir, Melville Herskovits, Lloyd Warner and Bronisław Malinowski. Under their tutelage, she showed great promise in her ethnographic studies of dance. Redfield, Herskovits, and Sapir&#x27;s contributions to cultural anthropology, exposed Dunham to topics and ideas that inspired her creatively and professionally. For example, she was highly influenced both by Sapir&#x27;s viewpoint on culture being made up of rituals, beliefs, customs and artforms, and by Herkovits&#x27; and Redfield&#x27;s studies highlighting links between African and African American cultural expression. It was in a lecture by Redfield that she learned about the relationship between dance and culture, pointing out that Black Americans had retained much of their African heritage in dances. Dunham&#x27;s relationship with Redfield in particular was highly influential. She wrote that he &quot;opened the floodgates of anthropology&quot; for her. He showed her the connection between dance and social life giving her the momentum to explore a new area of anthropology, which she later termed &quot;Dance Anthropology&quot;.

Katherine Dunham received her Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Doctoral degrees in anthropology from the University of Chicago, and later did an extensive anthropological study, particularly in the Caribbean.

In 1935, Dunham was awarded travel fellowships from the Julius Rosenwald and Guggenheim foundations to conduct ethnographic fieldwork in Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, and Trinidad studying the dance forms of the Caribbean. One example of this was studying how dance manifests within Haitian Vodou. Dunham also received a grant to work with Professor Melville Herskovits of Northwestern University, whose ideas about retention of African culture among African Americans served as a base for her research in the Caribbean.

After her research tour of the Caribbean in 1935, Dunham returned to Chicago in the late spring of 1936. In August she was awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree, a Ph.B., bachelor of philosophy, with her principal area of study being social anthropology. She was one of the first African-American women to attend this college and to earn these degrees. In 1938, using materials collected ethnographic fieldwork, Dunham submitted a thesis, &quot;The Dances of Haiti: A Study of Their Material Aspect, Organization, Form, and Function,&quot;. to the Department of Anthropology in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a master&#x27;s degree. However, fully aware of her passion for both dance performance, as well as anthropological research, she felt she had to choose between the two. Although Dunham was offered another grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to pursue her academic studies, she chose dance. She did this for many reasons. However, one key reason was that she knew she would be able to reach a broader public through dance, as opposed to the inaccessible institutions of academia. Never completing her required coursework for her graduate degree, she departed for Broadway and Hollywood.

Despite her choosing dance, Dunham often voiced recognition of her debt to the discipline: &quot;without [anthropology] I don&#x27;t know what I would have done….In anthropology, I learned how to feel about myself in relation to other people…. You can&#x27;t learn about dances until you learn about people. In my mind, it&#x27;s the most fascinating thing in the world to learn&quot;.

==Ethnographic fieldwork==
Her field work in the Caribbean began in Jamaica, where she lived for several months in the remote Maroon village of Accompong, deep in the mountains of Cockpit Country. (She later wrote &quot;Journey to Accompong&quot;, a book describing her experiences there.) Then she traveled to Martinique and to Trinidad and Tobago for short stays, primarily to do an investigation of Shango, the African god who was still considered an important presence in West Indian religious culture. Early in 1936, she arrived in Haiti, where she remained for several months, the first of her many extended stays in that country through her life.

While in Haiti, Dunham investigated Vodun rituals and made extensive research notes, particularly on the dance movements of the participants. She recorded her findings through ethnographic fieldnotes and by learning dance techniques, music and song, alongside her interlocutors. This style of participant observation research was not yet common within the discipline of anthropology. However, it has now became a common practice within the discipline. She was one of the first researchers in anthropology to &quot;use&quot; her research of Afro-Haitian dance and culture for remedying racist misrepresentation of African culture in the miseducation of Black Americans. She felt it was necessary to use the knowledge she gained in her research to acknowledge that Africanist esthetics are significant to the cultural equation in American dance.
Years later, after extensive studies and initiations in Haiti, she became a mambo in the Vodun religion. She also became friends with, among others, Dumarsais Estimé, then a high-level politician, who became president of Haiti in 1949. Somewhat later, she assisted him, at considerable risk to her life, when he was persecuted for his progressive policies and sent in exile to Jamaica after a coup d&#x27;état.

==Dancer and Choreographer==
===From 1928 to 1938===

Dunham&#x27;s dance career first began in Chicago when she joined the Little Theater Company of Harper Avenue. In 1928, while still an undergraduate, Dunham began to study ballet with Ludmilla Speranzeva, a Russian dancer who had settled in Chicago, after having come to the United States with the Franco-Russian vaudeville troupe &quot;Le Théâtre de la Chauve-Souris,&quot; directed by impresario Nikita Balieff. Dunham also studied ballet with Mark Turbyfill and Ruth Page, who became prima ballerina of the Chicago Opera. Additionally, she worked closely with Vera Mirova who specialized in &quot;Oriental&quot; dance. Through her ballet teachers, she was also exposed to Spanish, East Indian, Javanese, and Balinese dance forms.

In 1931, at the age of 21, Dunham formed a group called &quot;Ballets Nègres,&quot; one of the first black ballet companies in the United States. The group performed Dunham&#x27;s &quot;Negro Rhapsody&quot; at the Chicago Beaux Arts Ball. After this well-received performance in 1931, the group was disbanded. Encouraged by Speranzeva to focus on modern dance instead of ballet, Dunham opened her first dance school in 1933, calling it the Negro Dance Group. It was a venue for Dunham to teach young black dancers about their African heritage.

In 1934–1936, Dunham performed as a guest artist with the ballet company of the Chicago Opera. Ruth Page had written a scenario and created the choreography for William Grant Still&#x27;s ballet &quot;La Guiablesse&quot; (&quot;The Devil Woman&quot;), based on a Martinican folk tale in Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s &quot;Two Years in the French West Indies&quot;. It opened in Chicago in 1933, with a black cast and with Page dancing the title role. The next year the production was repeated with Katherine Dunham in the lead and with students from Dunham&#x27;s Negro Dance Group in the ensemble. Her dance career was interrupted in 1935 when she received funding from the Rosenwald Foundation which allowed her to travel to Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad, and Haiti for eighteen months to explore each country&#x27;s respective dance cultures. The result of this trip was Dunham&#x27;s Master&#x27;s thesis entitled &quot;The Dances of Haiti&quot;.

Having completed her undergraduate work at the University of Chicago and decided to pursue a performing career rather than academic studies, Dunham revived her dance ensemble. In 1937 she traveled with them to New York to take part in &quot;A Negro Dance Evening&quot;, organized by Edna Guy at the 92nd Street YMHA. The troupe performed a suite of West Indian dances in the first half of the program and a ballet entitled &quot;Tropic Death&quot;, with Talley Beatty, in the second half. Upon returning to Chicago, the company performed at the Goodman Theater and at the Abraham Lincoln Center. Dunham created &quot;Rara Tonga&quot; and &quot;Woman with a Cigar&quot; at this time, which became well known. With choreography characterized by exotic sexuality, both became signature works in the Dunham repertory. After her company performed successfully, Dunham was chosen as dance director of the Chicago Negro Theater Unit of the Federal Theatre Project. In this post, she choreographed the Chicago production of &quot;Run Li&#x27;l Chil&#x27;lun&quot;, performed at the Goodman Theater. She also created several other works of choreography, including &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; (a response to the play by Eugene O&#x27;Neill) and &quot;Barrelhouse&quot;.

At this time Dunham first became associated with designer John Pratt, whom she later married. Together, they produced the first version of her dance composition &quot;L&#x27;Ag&#x27;Ya&quot;, which premiered on January 27, 1938, as a part of the Federal Theater Project in Chicago. Based on her research in Martinique, this three-part performance integrated elements of a Martinique fighting dance into American ballet.

===From 1939 to the Late 1950s===
In 1939, Dunham&#x27;s company gave additional performances in Chicago and Cincinnati and then returned to New York. Dunham had been invited to stage a new number for the popular, long-running musical revue &quot;Pins and Needles 1940&quot;, produced by the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers Union. As this show continued its run at the Windsor Theater, Dunham booked her own company in the theater for a Sunday performance. This concert, billed as &quot;Tropics&quot; and &quot;Le Hot Jazz&quot;, included not only her favorite partners Archie Savage and Talley Beatty, but her principal Haitian drummer, Papa Augustin. Initially scheduled for a single performance, the show was so popular that the troupe repeated it for another ten Sundays.

Based on this success, the entire company was engaged for the 1940 Broadway production &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;, staged by George Balanchine and starring Ethel Waters. With Dunham in the sultry role of temptress Georgia Brown, the show ran for 20 weeks in New York. It next moved to the West Coast for an extended run of performances there. The show created a minor controversy in the press.

After the national tour of &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;, the Dunham company stayed in Los Angeles, where they appeared in the Warner Brothers short film &quot;Carnival of Rhythm&quot; (1941). The next year, after the US entered World War II, Dunham appeared in the Paramount musical film &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; (1942) in a specialty number, &quot;Sharp as a Tack,&quot; with Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson. Other movies she performed in as a dancer during this period included the Abbott and Costello comedy &quot;Pardon My Sarong&quot; (1942) and the black musical &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943), which featured a stellar range of actors, musicians and dancers.

The company returned to New York. The company was located on the property that formerly belonged to the Isadora Duncan Dance in Caravan Hill but subsequently moved to W 43rd Street. In September 1943, under the management of the impresario Sol Hurok, her troupe opened in &quot;Tropical Review&quot; at the Martin Beck Theater. Featuring lively Latin American and Caribbean dances, plantation dances, and American social dances, the show was an immediate success. The original two-week engagement was extended by popular demand into a three-month run, after which the company embarked on an extensive tour of the United States and Canada. In Boston, then a bastion of conservatism, the show was banned in 1944 after only one performance. Although it was well received by the audience, local censors feared that the revealing costumes and provocative dances might compromise public morals. After the tour, in 1945, the Dunham company appeared in the short-lived &quot;Blue Holiday&quot; at the Belasco Theater in New York, and in the more successful &quot;Carib Song&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre. The finale to the first act of this show was &quot;Shango&quot;, a staged interpretation of a Vodun ritual, which became a permanent part of the company&#x27;s repertory.

In 1946, Dunham returned to Broadway for a revue entitled &quot;Bal Nègre&quot;, which received glowing notices from theater and dance critics. Early in 1947 Dunham choreographed the musical play &quot;Windy City&quot;, which premiered at the Great Northern Theater in Chicago. Later in the year she opened a cabaret show in Las Vegas, during the first year that the city became a popular entertainment as well as gambling destination. Later that year she took her troupe to Mexico, where their performances were so popular that they stayed and performed for more than two months. After Mexico, Dunham began touring in Europe, where she was an immediate sensation. In 1948, she opened &quot;A Caribbean Rhapsody&quot;, first at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London, and then took it to the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris.

This was the beginning of more than 20 years during which Dunham performed with her company almost exclusively outside the United States. During these years, the Dunham company appeared in some 33 countries in Europe, North Africa, South America, Australia, and East Asia. Dunham continued to develop dozens of new productions during this period, and the company met with enthusiastic audiences in every city. Despite these successes, the company frequently ran into periods of financial difficulties, as Dunham was required to support all of the 30 to 40 dancers and musicians. Richard Buckle&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Adventures of a Ballet Critic&quot; (Cresset Press, 1953) contains extended descriptions of his association with Dunham and John Pratt during her company&#x27;s residency in London in 1948 with &quot;A Caribbean Rhapsody&quot;, and Buckle&#x27;s collaboration with Dunham on a book about her work (&quot;Katherine Dunham: Her dancers, singers and musicians&quot; (Ballet Productions, 1949). This book was printed but never on sale due to Buckle&#x27;s financial problems; the British Library holds a copy. 

Dunham and her company appeared in the Hollywood movie &quot;Casbah&quot; (1948) with Tony Martin, Yvonne De Carlo, and Peter Lorre, and in the Italian film &quot;Botta e Risposta&quot;, produced by Dino de Laurentiis. Also that year they appeared in the first ever, hour-long American spectacular televised by NBC, when television was first beginning to spread across America. This was followed by television spectaculars filmed in London, Buenos Aires, Toronto, Sydney, and Mexico City.

In 1950, Sol Hurok presented Katherine Dunham and Her Company in a dance revue at the Broadway Theater in New York, with a program composed of some of Dunham&#x27;s best works. It closed after only 38 performances. The company soon embarked on a tour of venues in South America, Europe, and North Africa. They had particular success in Denmark and France. In the mid-1950s, Dunham and her company appeared in three films: &quot;Mambo&quot; (1954), made in Italy; &quot;Die Grosse Starparade&quot; (1954), made in Germany; and &quot;Música en la Noche&quot; (1955), made in Mexico City.

===Later career===
The Dunham company&#x27;s international tours ended in Vienna in 1960. They were stranded without money because of bad management by their impresario. Dunham saved the day by arranging for the company to be paid to appear in a German television special, &quot;Karibische Rhythmen&quot;, after which they returned to the United States. Dunham&#x27;s last appearance on Broadway was in 1962 in &quot;Bamboche!&quot;, which included a few former Dunham dancers in the cast and a contingent of dancers and drummers from the Royal Troupe of Morocco. It was not a success, closing after only eight performances.

A highlight of Dunham&#x27;s later career was the invitation from New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera to stage dances for a new production of &quot;Aida&quot;, starring soprano Leontyne Price. In 1963, she became the first African American to choreograph for the Met since Hemsley Winfield set the dances for &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; in 1933. The critics acknowledged the historical research she did on dance in ancient Egypt, but they were not appreciative of her choreography as staged for this production.

Subsequently, Dunham undertook various choreographic commissions at several venues in the United States and in Europe. In 1966, she served as a State Department representative for the United States to the first ever World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal. In 1967 she officially retired, after presenting a final show at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. Even in retirement Dunham continued to choreograph: one of her major works was directing the premiere full, posthumous production Scott Joplin&#x27;s opera &quot;Treemonisha&quot; in 1972, a joint production of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Morehouse College chorus in Atlanta, conducted by Robert Shaw. This work was never produced in Joplin&#x27;s lifetime, but since the 1970s, it has been successfully produced in many venues.

In 1978 Dunham was featured in the PBS special, &quot;Divine Drumbeats: Katherine Dunham and Her People&quot;, narrated by James Earl Jones, as part of the &quot;Dance in America&quot; series. Alvin Ailey later produced a tribute for her in 1987–88 at Carnegie Hall with his American Dance Theater, entitled &quot;The Magic of Katherine Dunham.&quot;

==Educator and writer==

In 1945, Dunham opened and directed the Katherine Dunham School of Dance and Theatre near Times Square in New York City. Her dance company was provided with rent-free studio space for three years by an admirer and patron, Lee Shubert; it had an initial enrollment of 350 students.

The program included courses in dance, drama, performing arts, applied skills, humanities, cultural studies, and Caribbean research. In 1947 it was expanded and granted a charter as the Katherine Dunham School of Cultural Arts. The school was managed in Dunham&#x27;s absence by Syvilla Fort, one of her dancers, and thrived for about 10 years. It was considered one of the best learning centers of its type at the time. Schools inspired by it were later opened in Stockholm, Paris, and Rome by dancers who had been trained by Dunham.

Her alumni included many future celebrities, such as Eartha Kitt. As a teenager, she won a scholarship to the Dunham school and later became a dancer with the company, before beginning her successful singing career. Dunham and Kitt collaborated again in the 1970s in an Equity Production of the musical &quot;Peg,&quot; based on the Irish play, &quot;Peg O&#x27; My Heart.&quot; Dunham Company member Dana McBroom-Manno was selected as a featured artist in the show, which played on the Music Fair Circuit.

Others who attended her school included James Dean, Gregory Peck, Jose Ferrer, Jennifer Jones, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier, Shirley MacLaine and Warren Beatty. Marlon Brando frequently dropped in to play the bongo drums, and jazz musician Charles Mingus held regular jam sessions with the drummers. Known for her many innovations, Dunham developed a dance pedagogy, later named the Dunham Technique, a style of movement and exercises based in traditional African dances, to support her choreography. This won international acclaim and is now taught as a modern dance style in many dance schools.

By 1957, Dunham was under severe personal strain, which was affecting her health. She decided to live for a year in relative isolation in Kyoto, Japan, where she worked on writing memoirs of her youth. The first work, entitled &quot;A Touch of Innocence: Memoirs of Childhood&quot;, was published in 1959. A continuation based on her experiences in Haiti, &quot;Island Possessed&quot;, was published in 1969. A fictional work based on her African experiences, &quot;Kasamance: A Fantasy&quot;, was published in 1974. Throughout her career, Dunham occasionally published articles about her anthropological research (sometimes under the pseudonym of Kaye Dunn) and sometimes lectured on anthropological topics at universities and scholarly societies.

In 1963 Dunham was commissioned to choreograph &quot;Aida&quot; at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera Company, with Leontyne Price in the title role. Members of Dunham&#x27;s last New York Company auditioned to become members of the Met Ballet Company. Among her dancers selected were Marcia McBroom, Dana McBroom, Jean Kelly, and Jesse Oliver. The Met Ballet Company dancers studied Dunham Technique at Dunham&#x27;s 42nd Street dance studio for the entire summer leading up to the season opening of &quot;Aida.&quot; Lyndon B. Johnson was in the audience for opening night. Dunham&#x27;s background as an anthropologist gave the dances of the opera a new authenticity. She was also consulted on costuming for the Egyptian and Ethiopian dress. Dana McBroom-Manno still teaches Dunham Technique in New York City and is a Master of Dunham Technique.

In 1964, Dunham settled in East St. Louis, and took up the post of artist-in-residence at Southern Illinois University in nearby Edwardsville. There she was able to bring anthropologists, sociologists, educational specialists, scientists, writers, musicians, and theater people together to create a liberal arts curriculum that would be a foundation for further college work. One of her fellow professors, with whom she collaborated, was architect Buckminster Fuller.

The following year, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Dunham to be technical cultural adviser—a sort of cultural ambassador—to the government of Senegal in West Africa. Her mission was to help train the Senegalese National Ballet and to assist President Leopold Senghor with arrangements for the First Pan-African World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar (1965–66). Later Dunham established a second home in Senegal, and she occasionally returned there to scout for talented African musicians and dancers.

In 1967, Dunham opened the Performing Arts Training Center (PATC) in East St. Louis in an effort to use the arts to combat poverty and urban unrest. The restructuring of heavy industry had caused the loss of many working-class jobs, and unemployment was high in the city. After the 1968 riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Dunham encouraged gang members in the ghetto to come to the center to use drumming and dance to vent their frustrations. The PATC teaching staff was made up of former members of Dunham&#x27;s touring company, as well as local residents. While trying to help the young people in the community, Dunham was arrested. This gained international headlines and the embarrassed local police officials quickly released her. She also continued refining and teaching the Dunham Technique to transmit that knowledge to succeeding generations of dance students. She lectured every summer until her death at annual Masters&#x27; Seminars in St. Louis, which attracted dance students from around the world. She established the Katherine Dunham Centers for Arts and Humanities in East St. Louis to preserve Haitian and African instruments and artifacts from her personal collection.

In 1976, Dunham was guest artist-in-residence and lecturer for Afro-American studies at the University of California, Berkeley. A photographic exhibit honoring her achievements, entitled &quot;Kaiso! Katherine Dunham,&quot; was mounted at the Women&#x27;s Center on the campus. In 1978, an anthology of writings by and about her, also entitled &quot;Kaiso! Katherine Dunham&quot;, was published in a limited, numbered edition of 130 copies by the Institute for the Study of Social Change.

=== Dunham Technique ===
Dunham technique is a codified dance training technique developed by Katherine Dunham in the mid 20th century. Commonly grouped into the realm of modern dance techniques, Dunham is a technical dance form developed from elements of indigenous African and Afro-Caribbean dances. Strongly founded in her anthropological research in the Caribbean, Dunham technique introduces rhythm as the backbone of various widely known modern dance principles including contraction and release, groundedness, fall and recover, counterbalance, and many more. Using some ballet vernacular, Dunham incorporates these principles into a set of class exercises she labeled as &quot;processions&quot;. Each procession builds on the last and focuses on conditioning the body to prepare for specific exercises that come later. Video footage of Dunham technique classes show a strong emphasis on anatomical alignment, breath, and fluidity. Dancers are frequently instructed to place weight on the balls of their feet, lengthen their lumbar and cervical spines, and breathe from the abdomen and not the chest. There is also a strong emphasis on training dancers in the practices of engaging with polyrhythms by simultaneously moving their upper and lower bodies according to different rhythmic patterns. These exercises prepare the dancers for African social and spiritual dances that are practiced later in the class including the Mahi, Yonvalou, and Congo Paillette.

According to Dunham, the development of her technique came out of a need for specialized dancers to support her choreographic visions and a greater yearning for technique that &quot;said the things that [she] wanted to say.&quot; Dunham explains that while she admired the narrative quality of ballet technique, she wanted to develop a movement vocabulary that captured the essence of the Afro-Caribbean dancers she worked with during her travels. In a different interview, Dunham describes her technique &quot;as a way of life,&quot; a sentiment that seems to be shared by many of her admiring students. Many of Dunham students who attended free public classes in East St. Louis Illinois speak highly about the influence of her open technique classes and artistic presence in the city. Her classes are described as a safe haven for many and some of her students even attribute their success in life to the structure and artistry of her technical institution. Dunham technique is also inviting to the influence of cultural movement languages outside of dance including karate and capoeira.

Dunham is still taught at widely recognized dance institutions such as The American Dance Festival and The Ailey School.

==Social activism==
The Katherine Dunham Company toured throughout North America in the mid-1940s, performing as well in the racially segregated South. Dunham refused to hold a show in one theater after finding out that the city&#x27;s black residents had not been allowed to buy tickets for the performance. On another occasion, in October 1944, after getting a rousing standing ovation in Louisville, Kentucky, she told the all-white audience that she and her company would not return because &quot;your management will not allow people like you to sit next to people like us.&quot; She expressed a hope that time and the &quot;war for tolerance and democracy&quot; (this was during World War II) would bring a change. One historian noted that &quot;during the course of the tour, Dunham and the troupe had recurrent problems with racial discrimination, leading her to a posture of militancy which was to characterize her subsequent career.&quot;

In Hollywood, Dunham refused to sign a lucrative studio contract when the producer said she would have to replace some of her darker-skinned company members. She and her company frequently had difficulties finding adequate accommodations while on tour because in many regions of the country, black Americans were not allowed to stay at hotels.

While Dunham was recognized as &quot;unofficially&quot; representing American cultural life in her foreign tours, she was given very little assistance of any kind by the U.S. State Department. She had incurred the displeasure of departmental officials when her company performed &quot;Southland&quot;, a ballet that dramatized the lynching of a black man in the racist American South. Its premiere performance on December 9, 1950, at the Teatro Municipal in Santiago, Chile, generated considerable public interest in the early months of 1951. The State Department was dismayed by the negative view of American society that the ballet presented to foreign audiences. As a result, Dunham would later experience some diplomatic &quot;difficulties&quot; on her tours. The State Department regularly subsidized other less well-known groups, but it consistently refused to support her company (even when it was entertaining U.S. Army troops), although at the same time it did not hesitate to take credit for them as &quot;unofficial artistic and cultural representatives&quot;.

===The Afonso Arinos Law in Brazil===
In 1950, while visiting Brazil, Dunham and her group were refused rooms at a first-class hotel in São Paulo, the Hotel Esplanada, frequented by many American businessmen. Understanding that the fact was due to racial discrimination, she made sure the incident was publicized. The incident was widely discussed in the Brazilian press and became a hot political issue. In response, the Afonso Arinos law was passed in 1951 that made racial discrimination in publi places a felony in Brazil.

===Hunger strike===
In 1992, at age 83, Dunham went on a highly publicized hunger strike to protest the discriminatory U.S. foreign policy against Haitian boat-people.
&quot;Time&quot; reported that, &quot;she went on a 47-day hunger strike to protest the U.S.&#x27;s forced repatriation of Haitian refugees. &quot;My job&quot;, she said, &quot;is to create a useful legacy.&quot; During her protest, Dick Gregory led a non-stop vigil at her home, where many disparate personalities came to show their respect, such as Debbie Allen, Jonathan Demme, and Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam.

This initiative drew international publicity to the plight of the Haitian boat-people and U.S. discrimination against them. Dunham ended her fast only after exiled Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Jesse Jackson came to her and personally requested that she stop risking her life for this cause. In recognition of her stance, President Aristide later awarded her a medal of Haiti&#x27;s highest honor.

==Personal life==
Dunham married Jordis McCoo, a black postal worker, in 1931, but he did not share her interests and they gradually drifted apart, finally divorcing in 1938. About that time Dunham met and began to work with John Thomas Pratt, a Canadian who had become one of America&#x27;s most renowned costume and theatrical set designers. Pratt, who was white, shared Dunham&#x27;s interests in African-Caribbean cultures and was happy to put his talents in her service. After he became her artistic collaborator, they became romantically involved. In the summer of 1941, after the national tour of &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; ended, they went to Mexico, where inter-racial marriages were less controversial than in the United States, and engaged in a commitment ceremony on 20 July, which thereafter they gave as the date of their wedding. In fact, that ceremony was not recognized as a legal marriage in the United States, a point of law that would come to trouble them some years later. Katherine Dunham and John Pratt married in 1949 to adopt Marie-Christine, a French 14-month-old baby. From the beginning of their association, around 1938, Pratt designed the sets and every costume Dunham ever wore. He continued as her artistic collaborator until his death in 1986.

When she was not performing, Dunham and Pratt often visited Haiti for extended stays. On one of these visits, during the late 1940s, she purchased a large property of more than seven hectares (approximately 17.3 acres) in the Carrefours suburban area of Port-au-Prince, known as Habitation Leclerc. Dunham used Habitation Leclerc as a private retreat for many years, frequently bringing members of her dance company to recuperate from the stress of touring and to work on developing new dance productions. After running it as a tourist spot, with Vodun dancing as entertainment, in the early 1960s, she sold it to a French entrepreneur in the early 1970s.

In 1949, Dunham returned from international touring with her company for a brief stay in the United States, where she suffered a temporary nervous breakdown after the premature death of her beloved brother Albert. He had been a promising philosophy professor at Howard University and a protégé of Alfred North Whitehead. During this time, she developed a warm friendship with the psychologist and philosopher Erich Fromm, whom she had known in Europe. He was only one of a number of international celebrities who were Dunham&#x27;s friends. In December 1951, a photo of Dunham dancing with Ismaili Muslim leader Prince Ali Khan at a private party he had hosted for her in Paris appeared in a popular magazine and fueled rumors that the two were romantically linked. Both Dunham and the prince denied the suggestion. The prince was then married to actress Rita Hayworth, and Dunham was now legally married to John Pratt; a quiet ceremony in Las Vegas had taken place earlier in the year. The couple had officially adopted their foster daughter, a 14-month-old girl they had found as an infant in a Roman Catholic convent nursery in Fresnes, France. Named Marie-Christine Dunham Pratt, she was their only child.

Among Dunham&#x27;s closest friends and colleagues was Julie Robinson, formerly a performer with the Katherine Dunham Company, and her husband, singer and later political activist Harry Belafonte. Both remained close friends of Dunham for many years, until her death. Glory Van Scott and Jean-Léon Destiné were among other former Dunham dancers who remained her lifelong friends.

==Death ==
On May 21, 2006, Dunham died in her sleep from natural causes in New York City. She died at age 96.

==Legacy==
===Anthropology===
Katherine Dunham predated, pioneered, and demonstrated new ways of doing and envisioning Anthropology six decades ahead of the discipline.

In the 1970s, scholars of Anthropology such as Dell Hymes and William S. Willis began to discuss Anthropology&#x27;s participation in scientific colonialism. This wave continued throughout the 1990s with scholars publishing works (such as &quot;Decolonizing Anthropology: Moving Further in Anthropology for Liberation&quot;, Decolonizing Methodologies, and more recently, &quot;The Case for Letting Anthropology Burn&quot;) that critique anthropology and the discipline&#x27;s roles in colonial knowledge production and power structures. Much of the literature calls upon researchers to go beyond bureaucratic protocols to protect communities from harm, but rather use their research to benefit communities that they work with.

Six decades before this new wave of anthropological discourse began, Katherine Dunham&#x27;s work demonstrated anthropology being used as a force for challenging racist and colonial ideologies. After recovering crucial dance epistemologies relevant to people of the African diaspora during her ethnographic research, she applied anthropological knowledge toward developing her own dance pedagogy (Dunham Technique) that worked to reconcile with the legacy of colonization and racism and correct sociocultural injustices. Her dance education, while offering cultural resources for dealing with the consequences and realities of living in a racist environment, also brought about feelings of hope and dignity for inspiring her students to contribute positively to their own communities, and spreading essential cultural and spiritual capital within the U.S.

Just like her colleague Zora Neale Hurston, Dunham&#x27;s anthropology inspired the blurring of lines between creative disciplines and anthropology. Early on into graduate school, Dunham was forced to choose between finishing her master&#x27;s degree in anthropology and pursuing her career in dance. She describes this during an interview in 2002: &quot;My problem—my strong drive at that time was to remain in this academic position that anthropology gave me, and at the same time continue with this strong drive for motion—rhythmic motion&quot;. She ultimately chose to continue her career in dance without her master&#x27;s degree in anthropology. A key reason for this choice was because she knew that through dance, her work would be able to be accessed by a wider array of audiences; more so than if she continued to limit her work within academia.

However, this decision did not keep her from engaging with and highly influencing the discipline for the rest of her life and beyond. As one of her biographers, Joyce Aschenbrenner, wrote: &quot;anthropology became a life-way&quot; for Dunham. Her choreography and performances made use of a concept within Dance Anthropology called &quot;research-to-performance&quot;. Most of Dunham&#x27;s works previewed many questions essential to anthropology&#x27;s postmodern turn, such as critiquing understandings of modernity, interpretation, ethnocentrism, and cultural relativism. During this time, in addition to Dunham, numerous Black women such as Zora Neal Hurston, Caroline Bond Day, Irene Diggs, and Erna Brodber were also working to transform the discipline into an anthropology of liberation: employing critical and creative cultural production.

Numerous scholars describe Dunham as pivotal to the fields of Dance Education, Applied Anthropology, Humanistic Anthropology, African Diasporic Anthropology and Liberatory Anthropology. Additionally, she was named one of the most influential African American anthropologists. She was a pioneer of Dance Anthropology, established methodologies of ethnochoreology, and her work gives essential historical context to current conversations and practices of decolonization within and outside of the discipline of anthropology. Her legacy within Anthropology and Dance Anthropology continues to shine with each new day.

===Dance===
Anna Kisselgoff, a dance critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called Dunham &quot;a major pioneer in Black theatrical dance ... ahead of her time.&quot; &quot;In introducing authentic African dance-movements to her company and audiences, Dunham—perhaps more than any other choreographer of the time—exploded the possibilities of modern dance expression.&quot;

As one of her biographers, Joyce Aschenbrenner, wrote: &quot;Today, it is safe to say, there is no American black dancer who has not been influenced by the Dunham Technique, unless he or she works entirely within a classical genre&quot;, and the Dunham Technique is still taught to anyone who studies modern dance.

The highly respected &quot;Dance&quot; magazine did a feature cover story on Dunham in August 2000 entitled &quot;One-Woman Revolution&quot;. As Wendy Perron wrote, &quot;Jazz dance, &#x27;fusion,&#x27; and the search for our cultural identity all have their antecedents in Dunham&#x27;s work as a dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist. She was the first American dancer to present indigenous forms on a concert stage, the first to sustain a black dance company... She created and performed in works for stage, clubs, and Hollywood films; she started a school and a technique that continue to flourish; she fought unstintingly for racial justice.&quot;

Scholar of the arts Harold Cruse wrote in 1964: &quot;Her early and lifelong search for meaning and artistic values for black people, as well as for all peoples, has motivated, created opportunities for, and launched careers for generations of young black artists ... Afro-American dance was usually in the avant-garde of modern dance ... Dunham&#x27;s entire career spans the period of the emergence of Afro-American dance as a serious art.&quot;

Black writer Arthur Todd described her as &quot;one of our national treasures&quot;. Regarding her impact and effect he wrote: &quot;The rise of American Negro dance commenced ... when Katherine Dunham and her company skyrocketed into the Windsor Theater in New York, from Chicago in 1940, and made an indelible stamp on the dance world... Miss Dunham opened the doors that made possible the rapid upswing of this dance for the present generation.&quot; &quot;What Dunham gave modern dance was a coherent lexicon of African and Caribbean styles of movement—a flexible torso and spine, articulated pelvis and isolation of the limbs, a polyrhythmic strategy of moving—which she integrated with techniques of ballet and modern dance.&quot; &quot;Her mastery of body movement was considered &#x27;phenomenal.&#x27; She was hailed for her smooth and fluent choreography and dominated a stage with what has been described as &#x27;an unmitigating radiant force providing beauty with a feminine touch full of variety and nuance.&quot;

Richard Buckle, ballet historian and critic, wrote: &quot;Her company of magnificent dancers and musicians ... met with the success it has and that herself as explorer, thinker, inventor, organizer, and dancer should have reached a place in the estimation of the world, has done more than a million pamphlets could for the service of her people.&quot;

&quot;Dunham&#x27;s European success led to considerable imitation of her work in European revues ... it is safe to say that the perspectives of concert-theatrical dance in Europe were profoundly affected by the performances of the Dunham troupe.&quot;

While in Europe, she also influenced hat styles on the continent as well as spring fashion collections, featuring the Dunham line and Caribbean Rhapsody, and the Chiroteque Française made a bronze cast of her feet for a museum of important personalities.&quot;

The Katherine Dunham Company became an incubator for many well known performers, including Archie Savage, Talley Beatty, Janet Collins, Lenwood Morris, Vanoye Aikens, Lucille Ellis, Pearl Reynolds, Camille Yarbrough, Lavinia Williams, and Tommy Gomez.

Alvin Ailey, who stated that he first became interested in dance as a professional career after having seen a performance of the Katherine Dunham Company as a young teenager of 14 in Los Angeles, called the Dunham Technique &quot;the closest thing to a unified Afro-American dance existing.&quot;

For several years, Dunham&#x27;s personal assistant and press promoter was Maya Deren, who later also became interested in Vodun and wrote &quot;The Divine Horseman: The Voodoo Gods of Haiti&quot; (1953). Deren is now considered to be a pioneer of independent American filmmaking. Dunham herself was quietly involved in both the Voodoo and Orisa communities of the Caribbean and the United States, in particular with the Lucumi tradition.

Not only did Dunham shed light on the cultural value of black dance, but she clearly contributed to changing perceptions of blacks in America by showing society that as a black woman, she could be an intelligent scholar, a beautiful dancer, and a skilled choreographer. As Julia Foulkes pointed out, &quot;Dunham&#x27;s path to success lay in making high art in the United States from African and Caribbean sources, capitalizing on a heritage of dance within the African Diaspora, and raising perceptions of African American capabilities.&quot;

<doc id="1116565" wikidata="Q458041" url="?curid=1116565" title="Union-Castle Line">
<text>The Union-Castle Line was a British shipping line that operated a fleet of passenger liners and cargo ships between Europe and Africa from 1900 to 1977. It was formed from the merger of the Union Line and Castle Shipping Line.

It merged with Bullard King and Clan Line in 1956 to form British &amp; Commonwealth Shipping, and then with South African Marine Corporation (commonly referred to as Safmarine) in 1973 to create International Liner Services, but maintained its separate identity throughout. Its shipping operations ceased in 1977.

==Predecessor lines==

The Union Line was founded in 1853 as the Southampton Steam Shipping Company to transport coal from South Wales to Southampton. It was renamed the Union Steam Collier Company and then the Union Steamship Company. In 1857, renamed the Union Line, it won a contract to carry mail to South Africa, mainly the Cape Colony. The inaugural sailing of &quot;Dane&quot; left Southampton on 15 September.

Meanwhile, Donald Currie had built up the Castle Packet Co. which traded to Calcutta round the Cape of Good Hope. This trade was substantially curtailed by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and the Castle Line started to run to South Africa instead, later becoming the Castle Mail Packet Company.

In 1872 the Cape Colony gained responsible government and its first Prime Minister, John Molteno, ordered a re-negotiation of the country&#x27;s mail services. In 1876, keen to avoid either of the two main companies gaining a monopoly on the country&#x27;s shipping, he awarded the South African mail contract jointly to both the Castle Mail Packet Company and the Union Line. The contract included a condition that the two companies would not amalgamate, as well as other clauses to promote competition, such as alternating services and speed premiums. This competition led to their shipping services running at unprecedented speed and efficiency. The contract was eventually to expire however, and the period of intense competition was later to give way to co-operation, including transporting troops and military equipment during the Boer War. Finally, on 8 March 1900, the Union Line and Castle Shipping Line merged, creating the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, Ltd, with Castle Shipping Line taking over the fleet.

==Union-Castle Line==



Union-Castle named most of their ships with the suffix &quot;Castle&quot; in their names; the names of several inherited from the Union Line were changed to this scheme (for example, &quot;Galician&quot; became ) but others (such as ) retained their original name. They were well known for the lavender-hulled liners with red funnels topped in black, running on a rigid timetable between Southampton and Cape Town. Every Thursday at 4pm a Union-Castle Royal Mail Ship would leave Southampton bound for Cape Town. At the same time, a Union-Castle Royal Mail Ship would leave Cape Town bound for Southampton. In 1922 the line introduced its Round Africa service, a nine-week voyage calling at twenty ports en route. Alternate sailings travelled out via the Suez Canal and out via West Africa.

The combined line was sold to the Royal Mail Line in 1911, but continued to operate as Union-Castle. Many of the line&#x27;s vessels were requisitioned for service as troop ships or hospital ships in the First World War, and eight were sunk by mines or German U-boats. The Royal Mail Line ran into financial difficulties in the 1930s, culminating in the prosecution of its director Lord Kylsant, and Union-Castle Line became an independent company again with Vernon Thomson as Managing Director. Many vessels were again requisitioned in the Second World War. Three – , &quot;Carnarvon Castle&quot;, &quot;Dunvegan Castle&quot; became armed merchant cruisers. (1939) was also first requisitioned as an armed merchant cruiser, but later served as an escort carrier.

After the war the line made good use of its three ships converted to troop transports to facilitate carrying the vast number of emigrants seeking new lives in East and South Africa. When they ran out of berths the line set up its own internal travel agency to book passages on other lines and even air services. The mail service to South Africa, curtailed during hostilities, recommenced with the sailing of &quot;Roxburgh Castle&quot; from Southampton on 2 January 1947.

==British &amp; Commonwealth, and International Liner Services==
The company took over the King Line in 1949, and merged with Bullard King and Clan Line in 1956 to form British &amp; Commonwealth Shipping. It merged with South African Marine Corporation in 1973 to create International Liner Services, but competition with air travel adversely affected its shipping activities, and cargo shipping rapidly became containerised. The final South African mail service arrived in Southampton on 24 October 1977, and International Liner Services withdrew from shipping in 1982. British &amp; Commonwealth continued in other fields, and acquired Atlantic Computers in 1989, but accounting problems soon became apparent and British &amp; Commonwealth was liquidated in 1990.

In the 1950s and 60s the line operated a fleet of fifteen ships, eight on the principal weekly mail run from Southampton to Cape Town. Each ship could carry an average of two hundred First Class passengers and four hundred and fifty in Tourist Class. Six of the remaining ships operated the monthly Round Africa service, sailing both clockwise and anti-clockwise round the continent. The remaining ship operated a service carrying up to 750 Tourist Class passengers to Beira and back via the West Coast route every three months.

In December 1999 the Union-Castle name was revived for a millennium cruise; the P&amp;O ship was chartered for a 60-day cruise around Africa, and had its funnel repainted for the occasion.

The last few surviving Union-Castle Line ships were scrapped in the early 21st century, the former &quot;Kenya Castle&quot; in 2001, the former in 2003, the former &quot;Dunnottar Castle&quot; in 2004, and finally in 2005.

==Ships==

The initial Union fleet consisted of the colliers &quot;Union&quot;, &quot;Briton&quot;, &quot;Saxon&quot;, &quot;Norman&quot; and &quot;Dane&quot;. In 1860 this was augmented by the much larger &quot;Cambrian&quot;.

and the Castle Line fleet included:
:&quot;Arundel Castle&quot; (3) (1894–1905), &quot;Avondale Castle&quot; (1897–1912), &quot;Braemar Castle&quot; (1) (1898–1924), &quot;Carisbrook Castle&quot; (1898–1922), &quot;Doune Castle&quot; (1890–1904), &quot;Dunolly Castle&quot; (1897–1905), (1890–1913), &quot;Dunvegan Castle&quot; (1896–1923), &quot;Garth Castle&quot; (1880–1901), &quot;Harlech Castle&quot; (1894–1904), &quot;Hawarden Castle&quot; (1883–1904), (1899–1931), &quot;Kinfauns Castle&quot; (2) (1899–1927), &quot;Lismore Castle&quot; (1891–1904), (1883–1903), (2) (1883–1906), &quot;Raglan Castle&quot; (1897–1905), &quot;Roslin Castle&quot; (2) (1883–1904), &quot;Tantallon Castle&quot; (2) (1894–1901), &quot;Tintagel Castle&quot; (1) (1896–1912)

<text>The Olin Raschig process is a chemical process for the production of hydrazine. The main steps in this process, patented by German chemist Friedrich Raschig in 1906 and one of three reactions named after him, are the formation of monochloramine from ammonia and hypochlorite, and the subsequent reaction of monochloramine with ammonia towards hydrazine. The process was further optimised and used by the Olin Corporation for the production of anhydrous hydrazine for aerospace applications.

== Process ==
The commercially used Olin Raschig process consists of the following steps:

First, sodium hypochlorite solution is mixed with a threefold excess of ammonia at 5 °C to give monochloramine. The primary reaction proceeds according to the idealised equation

The monochloramine solution is then added to a 30-fold excess of ammonia at 130 °C and elevated pressure, causing a second reaction

The hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide byproducts undergo a secondary reaction to release the byproducts of water and sodium chloride. The overall reaction is thus

Excess ammonia and sodium chloride are removed by distillation, followed by azeotropic distillation with aniline to remove water.

<doc id="1116583" wikidata="Q1263335" url="?curid=1116583" title="Stoa of Attalos">
<text>The Stoa of Attalos (also spelled Attalus; ) was a stoa (covered walkway or portico) in the Agora of Athens, Greece. It was built by and named after King Attalos II of Pergamon, who ruled between 159 and 138 BC. The building was reconstructed from 1952 to 1956 by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and currently houses the Museum of the Ancient Agora.

The museum&#x27;s exhibits are mostly connected with the Athenian democracy. The collection of the museum includes clay, bronze and glass objects, sculptures, coins and inscriptions from the 7th to the 5th century BC, as well as pottery of the Byzantine period and the Turkish conquest.

==Building==
Typical of the Hellenistic age, the stoa was more elaborate and larger than the earlier buildings of ancient Athens and had two rather than the normal one storeys. The stoa&#x27;s dimensions are and it is made of Pentelic marble and limestone. The building skillfully makes use of different architectural orders. The Doric order was used for the exterior colonnade on the ground floor with Ionic for the interior colonnade. This combination had been used in stoas since the Classical period and was by Hellenistic times quite common. On the upper floor of the building, the exterior colonnade was Ionic and the interior Pergamene. 

Each storey had two aisles and twenty-one rooms lining the western wall. The rooms of both stories were lighted and vented through doorways and small windows located on the back wall. There were stairways leading up to the upper storey at each end of the stoa.

The building is similar in its basic design to the Stoa that Attalos&#x27; brother, and predecessor as king, Eumenes II, had erected on the south slope of the Acropolis next to the Theatre of Dionysus. The main difference is that Attalos&#x27; stoa had a row of 42 closed rooms at the rear on the ground floor which served as shops. The spacious colonnades were used as a covered promenade.

==History==
A dedicatory inscription engraved on the architrave states that it was built by Attalos II, who was ruler of Pergamon. The stoa was a gift to the city of Athens for the education that Attalos received there under the philosopher Carneades. His elder brother and his father had previously made substantial gifts to the city. The building was constructed on the east side of the Agora or market place of Athens and was used from approximately 150 B.C. onwards for a variety of purposes.

The stoa was in frequent use until its woodwork was burned by the Heruli in AD 267. The ruins became part of a fortification wall, which made it easily seen in modern times. 
Between 1859-62 and in 1898-1902 the ruins of the Stoa were cleared and identified by the Greek Archaeological Society. Their efforts were completed by the American School of Classical Studies during the course of its excavation of the Agora which had commenced in May 1931 under the supervision of T. Leslie Shear.
In 1948, Homer Thompson (who was field director of the Agora excavations from 1946–1967 being undertaken by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA) proposed that the Stoa of Attalos be reconstructed to serve as a museum to house archaeological finds. The Stoa was a suitable size and enough architectural elements remained to assist in producing an accurate reconstruction. In particular enough of the northern end remained to allow engineers to ensure that the reconstructed building would be the same height as the original building. His proposal was accepted and so in June 1953, Ward M. Canaday (president of the Board of Trustees of ASCSA from 1949–1964) authorized the beginning of the work, and in January 1954, the landscape program was formally inaugurated.

Funded by contributions from American donors (including a US$1 million financial contribution from John D. Rockefeller Jr., and from industrialist and car manufacturer Ward Murphey Canaday, his wife Mariam Canaday née Coffin and their daughter Doreen Canaday Spitzer) the reconstruction of the Stoa was carried out by the ASCSA under the general supervision of the Department for Restoration of Ancient and Historic Monuments of the Ministry of Education, directed by Anastasios Orlandos. The plans were drawn by John Travlos, architect of the Agora excavations, while the reconstruction was supervised by the New York architecture firm of W. Stuart Thompson &amp; Phelps Barnum. Greek civil engineer George Biris served as consulting engineer.
The building was reconstructed on the original foundations but in order to facilitate its new role as a museum some changes were made to the basement storage area, window sizes and door positions while some internal walls were eliminated. The building incorporated as much of the original structure and materials as possible. In particular the north end, the southernmost shops, part of the south wall, and the south end of the outer steps were able to be retained. Quarries in Piraeus and on Mount Pentelicus were opened so as to provide material similar to the original. The walls were built of limestone from Piraeus, while the facade, the columns and interior trim used Pentelic marble from Mt. Pentelicus, and the roof tiles, clay from Attica. As many as 150 workmen were employed, including 50 master masons, 20 carpenters, and five steelworkers.

With the exception of the reconstruction of the Panathenaic Stadium for the 1896 Olympics, the rebuilding of the Stoa of Attalos was the most ambitious reconstruction of a freestanding ancient building carried out in Athens to that time. The reconstruction is particularly important in the study of ancient monuments because it is a faithful replica of the original building, to the degree possible within the limits of archaeological knowledge.
The Stoa was formally dedicated on 3 September 1956 at an event attended by members of the royal family, the Archbishop of Athens, various politicians and members of the public.

In 1957, the Greek state assumed responsibility for the administration and security of the museum and the archaeological site.

The ceremony of the signing of the 2003 Treaty of Accession of 10 countries – Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia – to the European Union was conducted in the Stoa of Attalos on 16 April 2003.

The Greek Ministry of Culture undertook further renovations in 2003 to 2004.

The second floor of the building was refurbished and reopened in 2012.

<doc id="1116584" wikidata="Q714013" url="?curid=1116584" title="Artsruni dynasty">
<text>The Artsrunis (; also Ardzruni or Artsrunid) were an ancient princely and, later, royal dynasty of Armenia.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Artsruni&quot; contains the ending , which is widespread in old Armenian family names. The early Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi derives the name from (, ). He implies that the Artsrunis carried standards with eagles on them and makes reference to a legend from Hadamakert (the center of the Artsrunis&#x27; home district of Aghbak) in which a bird protects a sleeping boy from the rain and sun; this is presumed to be a legend about the Artsrunis&#x27; ancestor (Sanasar, according to Manuk Abeghian) involving an eagle. James Russell notes that the eagle was a totemic animal for the Artsrunis and connects the dynasty&#x27;s name with Urartian , which is attested as the name of an Urartian king&#x27;s horse and may derive from Armenian . On this basis, Russell suggests that the Artsrunis may have had Urartian ancestors.

Hrach Martirosyan writes that this connection of &quot;Artsruni&quot; with is &quot;is quite attractive as far as the mythical context [surrounding the Artsrunis] is concerned&quot; but is unlikely to be a true etymology. He instead proposes that &quot;Artsruni&quot; is a patronymic deriving from an unattested name *, meaning &quot;having swift horses&quot;.

==Origins==
The Artsrunis claimed descent from the Assyrian king Sennacherib (). It mirrors the Bagratuni claim of Davidic descent and the Mamikonian claim of descent from the royal Han dynasty and is usually interpreted as a piece of genealogical mythology. The Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi is the first to mention this claim. This tradition likely developed among those houses after the Christianization of Armenia in the early 4th century, drawing from the biblical account according to which Sennacherib&#x27;s sons Adramelech and Sharezer fled to Armenia after murdering their father (Isaiah 37:38). Khorenatsi writes that the Armenian leader Skayordi settled one of the princes, Sanasar (biblical Sharezer), on the mountain of Sim (in the region of Sasun) and from him descended the Artsrunis and Gnunis.

On this basis of his connection of &quot;Artsruni&quot; with Urartian (see above), Russell suggests that the Artsrunis may have had Urartian ancestors. Vrezh Vardanyan writes that the dynasty was of purely local, Armenian origin and that they are mentioned in Urartian inscriptions as and lived southeast of Lake Van at that time.

According to the genealogist and historian Cyril Toumanoff, as well as historian M. Chahin, the Artsruni family were an offshoot of the earlier Orontids. Toumanoff, following Nicholas Adontz and Josef Markwart, suggests that Mithrobarzanes, the viceroy of Tigranes the Great in Sophene in 69 BC, may have been the earliest attested member of the family. &quot;Mithrobarzanes&quot;, or more precisely &quot;Mithrobuzanes&quot;, corresponds to Armenian , which was a common name among members of the Artsruni dynasty. &quot;Mithrobuzanes&quot; was also the name of the successor of Zariadres, a king of Sophene in the 2nd century BC who is thought to have been an Orontid. Markwart, Adontz and Toumanoff hypothesized that Mithrobuzanes, the viceroy of Tigranes, was a member of the Orontid branch which ruled Sophene as independent kings until Tigranes annexed Sophene to Greater Armenia. The Artsrunis are supposed to have ruled continued to rule Sophene, giving up their royal title but receiving the title of (&quot;vitaxa&quot;, &#x27;viceroy&#x27; or &#x27;margrave&#x27;). Then, according to Toumanoff, after the adoption of Christianity in Armenia, the Artsrunis obscured their Orontid origins with a genealogical myth drawn from the Bible. 

== History ==
During the reign of the Arsacid dynasty over Armenia, the Artsrunis ruled the princely estates of Greater and Lesser Aghbak in Vaspurakan (around modern Başkale, Turkey), southeast of Lake Van, gradually annexing the surrounding territory. In the middle of the 4th century the family was deposed. Chavash survived, and recovered power. In 369 the state was led by Meruzhan Artsruni who guided Persian troops to Armenia, exchanged Christianity for Mazdaism, and defeated the General (&quot;sparapet&quot;) Mamikonian. The latter recovered power soon after, however, and Meruzhan was killed.

Around 772 the Artsruni presided over the families of Amatuni, Rshtuni, Teruni of Daroynk (before a possession of the Bagratuni) and ruled the regions of Maku, Artaz, Great Zab Valley and Van river. In the same 8th century, the Bagratid dynasty, re-established the monarch of Armenia, and the Artsrunis were &quot;among its most powerful vassals and rivals&quot;. When the territory of historical Armenia was, about a century later, succeeded by several subkingdoms (each of whom were rule by &quot;lesser princes&quot;), the area of Vaspurakan came to be ruled in by the Artsrunis, who, in 908, received their investiture from their Abbasid suzerains. Thus, Khatcḥik-Gagik II Artsruni was the first of the Artsrunis to rule Vaspurakan under Abbasid suzerainty.

Gagik I of Vaspurakan claimed the title of &quot;King of Armenia&quot; from the Bagratuni dynasty until his death in 936 or 943.

In the beginning of the 11th century, the Artsruni settled westwards in Cappadocia, retreating from eastern invaders. In 1021, Senekerim-Hovhannes of Vaspurakan was given Sebaste, Evdokia, and possibly Amasia as fiefdom from the Byzantine emperor Basil II in return for his entire kingdom. He and 14,000 of his retainers settled in the Theme of Sebasteia, while the Kingdom of Vaspurakan became the Byzantine theme of Vasprakania, which lasted for fifty years until 1071.

==Cultural legacy==
The Artsrunis were patrons of the arts, which, as Toumanoff states, is evidenced in the &quot;splendid tenth-century monuments of architecture and of fresco and miniature painting especially in the palace and the church of Aghtamar&quot;. These two constructions were built on the order of Khachik Gagik II. In the ninth and tenth centuries, a member of the house, Tovma Artsruni, wrote &quot;The History of the House of Artsruni&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Umberto Eco introduced the character of Artsruni, a nobleman and alchemist in Cilicia, in his fantastic novel &quot;Baudolino&quot;.

<text>Chen () was a state founded by the Duke Hu of Chen during the Zhou dynasty of ancient China. It existed from c. 1045 BC–479 BC. Its capital was Wanqiu, in present-day Huaiyang County in the plains of eastern Henan province. Chen, the 4th most popular Chinese surname in the world, and members of the Hu clan, the 13th most popular Chinese surname in the world, would claim descent from the Duke Hu of Chen who was in turn descended from the legendary Emperor Shun. At its peak, Chen encompassed fourteen cities in modern-day Henan and Anhui.

== Name ==
It is written 陳 the same as the Chen surname. In ancient texts, it is sometimes misspelled as 敶, also pronounced Chen.

== Territory ==
Chen was originally from Taihao (太昊、太皞), the capital of Fuxi&#x27;s clan. It was south of the Yellow River.

=== Capital ===

Its capital was Wanqiu, in present-day Huaiyang County in the plains of eastern Henan province. Zhu Xi explains that Wanqiu means &quot;[a hill] with a crater on top surrounded by high walls on all four sides&quot;.

== History ==

According to tradition, the royal family of Chen were descendants of the legendary sage king Emperor Shun. After the conquest of the Shang dynasty in 1046/45 BC, King Wu of Zhou enfeoffed his son-in-law Gui Man, a descendant of Shun, at Chen, and Man became known as Duke Hu of Chen (Chen Hugong).

Duke Shēn of Chen, son of Hugong then became second duke of Chen.

Chen later became an ally state of Chu, fighting as an ally of Chu at the Battle of Chengpu. It was finally unified with the Chu in 479 BC. Many people of Chen then took the name of their former country as their family name, and account for the many of Chinese people with the family name Chen today. After the destruction of the old Chu capital at Ying, Chen became the Chu capital.

== Achievements and descendants ==

* The founding duke, formally known as Duke Hu of Chen, is credited with being the originator of the Hu (surname) and the Chen (surname).
* The Chen clan would later found the Chen dynasty of China and then the Trần dynasty, a golden age of Vietnam (陳朝 Tran is the Vietnamese pronunciation of Chen).
* In 1400 AD, Hồ Quý Ly overthrew the Trần dynasty and established the Hồ dynasty (Hồ is the Vietnamese pronunciation for &quot;Hu&quot;). He claimed to be a descendant of Chen Hugong and Emperor Shun, and changed the name of Vietnam from Đại Việt to Đại Ngu (大虞), or Great Ngu (Ngu is the Vietnamese pronunciation for Yu 虞 the legendary state of Emperor Shun).
* In ancient times 陳 sounded similar to 東 dong, meaning &#x27;East&#x27;. It also sounded similar to 田 tian. After the warring states period, some members of the Chen clan in Qi (state) adopted the surname 田 Tian, which later became popular in Chinese and Japanese surnames. 
In summary, surnames with descent from Chen include:

* Chen surname 陳姓
* Gui surname 妫姓
* Hu surname 胡姓
* Tian surname 田姓
* Yu surname 虞姓
* Yao surname 姚姓
* Yuan surname 袁姓

== Culture ==
The Shijing has at least 10 songs dedicated to Chen:《宛丘》、《東門之枌》、《衛門》、《東門之池》、《東門之楊》、《墓門》、《防有鵲巢》、《月出》、《株林》、《澤陂》。

== Rulers ==
The state of Chen lasted nearly 600 years and produced over 25 rulers. In chronological order from first to last (note Hu Gong means Duke of Hu and vice versa):
# Duke Hu of Chen
#Duke Shēn of Chen 
#Duke Xiang of Chen

<doc id="1116589" wikidata="Q3548101" url="?curid=1116589" title="Ultravisitor">
<text>Ultravisitor is the seventh studio album by English electronic musician Tom Jenkinson, under the alias of Squarepusher. It was released on 8 March 2004 through Warp Records. In September 2024, Jenkinson announced a remaster of the album to commemorate its 20th anniversary, as well as an expanded and remastered edition of &quot;Venus No. 17&quot;, which was released on 25 October 2024.

== Background ==
The album incorporates many of the various musical styles exhibited by Jenkinson on his previous albums, including drum and bass, acid techno, jazz fusion, and electronic noise. A few of the tracks feature layered, modulated, or filtered bass guitar.

In an interview with I-D, Jenkinson confirmed that most of the tracks on &quot;Ultravisitor&quot; were recorded from shows in the UK, US and Canada. &quot;The point of using live versions of the tracks is that they show stupid people that, though their own stubbornness prevents them from being able to engage with my music, they hear other people cheering in the background, and realise that although this music is obscure, it cannot be totally inaccessible because other people like it.&quot;

Jenkinson has stated that the track &quot;50 Cycles&quot; took over a month to complete; &quot;I think the most time-consuming was 50 Cycles on &quot;Ultravisitor&quot;. Roughly speaking it took a month to make. This was the last piece to be completed on &quot;Ultravisitor&quot;, which contains several other pieces that also took unprecedentedly long to complete.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Ultravisitor&quot; was released on 8 March 2004. It was released on standard and special edition CDs, as well as on 2xLP. The special edition of the album came with a hardbound case and six page booklet. Jenkinson has stated that &quot;Ultravisitor is my spectacle of beauty and of terror. It is unknowable, and will never be understood by anybody, least of all its creator.

== Anniversary Edition ==
On 19 September 2024, Warp Records announced that the album would be remastered and reissued to coincide with its 20th anniversary. The reissue also included a bonus album, &quot;Venus No. 17 Maximised&quot;. This album consisted of material derived from the promo-only EP, &quot;Square Window&quot;, which was given out with original WarpMart pre-orders of &quot;Ultravisitor&quot;, as well as the &quot;Venus No. 17&quot; EP. The reissue was released on 20 October 2024, on 2xCD, 2xLP and streaming services.

== Reception ==
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;Ultravisitor&quot; received an average score of 74, based on 21 reviews, indicating a score of &quot;generally favorable&quot;.

&quot;Ultravisitor&quot; was generally well-received by critics. Reviewing the album for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Dominique Leone of gave the album a positive review, stating &quot;In some ways, &quot;Ultravisitor&quot; is the only Squarepusher album you need to know about. It contains instances of every idea, texture or beat he&#x27;s presented until now, and unlike recent releases Do You Know Squarepusher or Go Plastic, little of it sounds stale.&quot; Writing for &quot;AllMusic&quot;, John Bush called the album &quot;vastly more impressive than anyone could&#x27;ve expected from Squarepusher&quot;. Joshua Ostroff of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; said it was &quot;an album of surprising heart and laid-back calm, albeit still boasting bursts of mayhem.&quot;

Other critics were not so positive, however; reviewing the album for &quot;The Observer&quot;, Emma Warren said &quot;There will be people who think of Squarepusher&#x27;s music as the kind of clever and very important racket they should like - but never actually want to listen to. And if one fast-forwarded to the middle of 29-year-old Tom Jenkinson&#x27;s ninth album, you&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking they were right.&quot; Additionally, Leone also commented that &quot;At almost 80 minutes, &quot;Ultravisitor&quot; contains too much music to really hold together as a cohesive statement.&quot; Dorian Lynskey of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the album three stars, saying that &quot;&quot;Ultravisitor&quot; is yet another scattershot Squarepusher album [...] that infuriates as often as it delights.&quot;

<text>The Pantanal () is a natural region encompassing the world&#x27;s largest tropical wetland area, and the world&#x27;s largest flooded grasslands. It is located mostly within the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, but it extends into Mato Grosso and portions of Bolivia and Paraguay. It sprawls over an area estimated at between . Various subregional ecosystems exist, each with distinct hydrological, geological, and ecological characteristics; up to 12 of them have been defined.

Roughly 80% of the Pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons, nurturing a biologically diverse collection of aquatic plants and helping to support a dense array of animal species.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Pantanal&quot; comes from the Portuguese word and the Spanish word &quot;pantano&quot; that mean &quot;swamp&quot;, &quot;wetland&quot;, &quot;bog&quot;, &quot;quagmire&quot;, or &quot;marsh&quot; plus the suffix &quot;-al&quot;, that means &quot;abundance, agglomeration, collection&quot;.

== Geography and geology ==
The Pantanal covers about of gently-sloped basin that receives runoff from the upland areas (the Planalto highlands) and slowly releases the water through the Paraguay River and tributaries. The formation is a result of the large, concave, pre-Andean depression of the Earth&#x27;s crust, related to the Andean orogeny of the Tertiary. It constitutes an enormous internal river delta, in which several rivers flowing from the surrounding plateau merge, depositing their sediments and erosion residues, which have been filling the large depression area of the Pantanal. This area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger Parana-Paraguay Plain area, which encompasses a total of .

The Pantanal is bounded by the Chiquitano dry forests to the west and northwest, by the Arid Chaco dry forests to the southwest, and the Humid Chaco to the south. The Cerrado savannas lie to the north, east, and southeast. 

===Climate===
The Pantanal is a tropical wet and dry region with an average annual temperature of and rainfall between per year. Extreme temperatures can reach a high of or drop to . Throughout the year, temperature varies about with the warmest month being November (with an average temperature of ) and the coldest month being June (with an average temperature of ). Its wettest month is January (with an average of ) and its driest is June (with an average of ).

=== Hydrodynamics ===
Floodplain ecosystems such as the Pantanal are defined by their seasonal inundation and desiccation. They shift between phases of standing water and phases of dry soil, when the water table can be well below the root region. Soils range from high levels of sand in higher areas to higher amounts of clay and silt in riverine areas.

Elevation of the Pantanal ranges from above sea level. Annual rainfall over the flood basin is between , with most rainfall occurring between November and March. Annual average precipitation ranged from 920 to 1,540 mm in the years 1968-2000. In the Paraguay River portion of the Pantanal, water levels rise between two meters to five meters seasonally; water fluctuations in other parts of the Pantanal are less than this. Flood waters tend to flow slowly ( per second) due to the low gradients and high resistance offered by the dense vegetation.

When rising river waters first contact previously dry soil, the waters become oxygen-depleted, rendering the water environs anoxic. Many natural fish kills can occur if there are no oxygenated water refuges available. The reason for this remains speculative: it may be due to the growth of toxin-producing bacteria in the deoxygenated water rather than as a direct result of lack of oxygen.

== Flora ==
The vegetation of the Pantanal, often referred to as the &quot;Pantanal complex&quot;, is a mixture of plant communities typical of a variety of surrounding biome regions: these include moist tropical Amazonian rainforest plants, semiarid woodland plants typical of northeast Brazil, Brazilian &quot;cerrado&quot; savanna plants, and plants of the &quot;Chaco&quot; savannas of Bolivia and Paraguay. Forests usually occur at higher altitudes of the region, while grasslands cover the seasonally inundated areas. The key limiting factors for growth are inundation and, even more importantly, water-stress during the dry season.

According to Embrapa, approximately 2,000 different plants have been identified in the Pantanal biome and classified according to their potential, with some presenting significant medicinal promise.

== Fauna ==
The Pantanal ecosystem is home to some 463 species of birds, 269 species of fishes, more than 236 species of mammals, 141 species of reptiles and amphibians, and over 9,000 subspecies of invertebrates.

The apple snail (&quot;Pomacea lineata&quot;) is a keystone species in Pantanal&#x27;s ecosystem. When the wetlands are flooded once a year, the grass and other plants will eventually die and start to decay. During this process, decomposing microbes deplete the shallow water of all oxygen, suffocating larger decomposers. Unlike other decomposing animals, the apple snails have both gills and lungs, making it possible for them to thrive in anoxic waters where they recycle the nutrients. To get oxygen, they extend a long snorkel to the water surface, pumping air into their lungs. This ability allows them to consume all the dead plant matter and turn it into nutritious fertilizer available for the plants in the area. The snails themselves are also food for a variety of animals.

Among the rarest animals to inhabit the wetland of the Pantanal are the marsh deer (&quot;Blastocerus dichotomus&quot;) and the giant river otter (&quot;Pteronura brasiliensis&quot;). Parts of the Pantanal are also home to the following endangered or threatened species: the hyacinth macaw (&quot;Anodorhyncus hyacinthinus&quot;) (a bird endangered due to smuggling), the crowned solitary eagle (&quot;Buteogallus coronatus&quot;), the maned wolf (&quot;Chrysocyon brachyurus&quot;), the bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus&quot;), the South American tapir (&quot;Tapirus terrestris&quot;), and the giant anteater (&quot;Myrmecophaga tridactyla&quot;). Common species in the Pantanal include the capybara (&quot;Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris&quot;), ocelot &quot;(Leopardus pardalis)&quot;, and the yacare caiman (&quot;Caiman yacare&quot;). According to 1996 data, there were 10 million caimans in the Pantanal, making it the highest concentration of crocodilians in the world. The Pantanal is home to one of the largest and healthiest jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;) populations on Earth.

There are thirteen species of herons and egrets, six species of ibises and spoonbills, and five species of kingfishers that use the Pantanal as a breeding and feeding ground. There are nineteen species of parrots documented in the Pantanal, including five species of macaws. Some migratory birds include the American golden plover, peregrine falcon, and the bobolink.

Most fish are detritivores, primarily ingesting fine particles from sediments and plant surfaces. This is characteristic of fish living in South American flood-plains in general. Fish migration between river channels and flood-plain regions occurs seasonally. These fish have many adaptations that allow them to survive in the oxygen-depleted flood-plain waters.

In addition to the caiman, some of the reptiles that inhabit the Pantanal are the yellow anaconda (&quot;Eunectes notaeus&quot;), the gold tegu (&quot;Tupinambis teguixin&quot;), the red-footed tortoise (&quot;Geochelone carbonaria&quot;), and the green iguana (&quot;Iguana iguana&quot;).

== Threats ==
The Pantanal region includes essential sanctuaries for migratory birds, critical nursery grounds for aquatic life, and refuges for such creatures as the yacare caiman, deer, and Pantanal jaguar. Most species are not under threat due to the low deforestation rates (less than 17%) of native vegetation now in the area due to new regulations.

Some of the causes which threaten the Pantanal ecosystems are:

*Fishing
**Commercial fishing is focused on only a few species and is probably not sustainable. National and international sport fishing in the Paraguay river and its tributaries are the main focus for fishing activities. Local fishing communities have been under close watch by environmentalists as well.
*Cattle-ranching:
**Approximately 99% of the land in the Pantanal is privately owned for the purpose of agriculture and ranching, even though there are some regulations on available land based on the extent of flooding during each wet season.
**There are 2500 fazendas in the region and up to eight million cattle.
**Erosion and sedimentation caused by this activity alter the soil and hydrological characteristics of Pantanal flood-plain ecosystems; consequently, native species are threatened by the change in ecosystem variables.
*Hunting, poaching, and smuggling of endangered species: Reptile, wildcat, and parrot species are particularly at risk from the smuggling industry due to their high value on the black market.
*Uncontrolled tourism and overuse of natural resources
*Deforestation
**Establishment of logging companies during political turmoils in the region resulted in peak deforestation rates between 1978-1989. Many livelihoods were dependent on harvesting rubber trees as new waves of migrants arrived, resulting in what is now there today.
**Silt run-off from deforested highlands alters soil hydrology and is a significant threat to the Pantanal.
*Pollution from gold mining operations and agro-industry
**The Pantanal is a natural water treatment system as it removes chemicals, including pollutants, from water. Pollution from industrial development (especially gold mining) can harm native flora and fauna.
**However, water quality in the Pantanal was not significantly degraded as of 2002.
*Pollution from sewage systems and pesticides
**Movement to large-scale agriculture of food crops, mainly soy-beans, has adopted the use of large quantities of chemical pesticides and fertilizers which leach into the soil or run-off to the flood plains of the Pantanal.
*Infrastructure development (shipping canals, raised roads, pipelines)
**The proposed plan to dredge the Paraguay and Paraná Rivers to allow oceangoing ships to travel inland is of particular concern and could affect the hydrology (flooding and drainage cycles) of the region, and therefore impact the ecosystem.
*Forest Fires
**In late 2020, a quarter of the wetland was destroyed by an unprecedented fire attributed to climate change. An area estimated of about was razed by the fire, killing millions of vertebrates. Experts say 2020 was the most active year on record for wildfires. Until November 2020, Brazil&#x27;s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) had detected more than 21,200 fires in the Pantanal biome, a figure that is 69% higher than 2005, when the INPE recorded roughly 12,500 fires. There were 8,106 fires in September 2020 alone—more than four times the historic average for the month.
*Climate change
**Current predictive climate models indicate a progressive increase in the frequency of extreme events (for example, extreme rainfalls and extended droughts). These events could affect the Pantanal´s ecosystem functioning, amplifying and worsening human modifications of hydrological and environmental conditions in the basin.

== Protected areas ==
A portion of the Pantanal in Brazil has been protected as the Pantanal Matogrossense National Park. This park, established in September 1981, is located in the municipality of Poconé in the State of Mato Grosso, between the mouths of the Baía de São Marcos and the Gurupi Rivers. The park was designated a Ramsar Site of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention on May 24, 1993.

The SESC Pantanal Private Natural Heritage Reserve (&quot;Reserva Particular do Patrimonio Natural SESC Pantanal&quot;) is a privately owned reserve in Brazil, established in 1998 and in size. It is located in the north-eastern portion, known as &quot;Poconé&quot; Pantanal, not far from the Pantanal National Park. It is a mix of permanent rivers, seasonal streams, permanent and seasonal floodplain freshwater lakes, shrub-dominated wetlands and seasonally flooded forests, all dedicated to nature preservation, and was designated a Ramsar Site of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.

Otuquis National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area is a national park of Bolivia in the Pantanal. The entrance to Otuquis National park is through the town of Puerto Suarez.

<text>Ian Van Dahl is a Belgian vocal trance and Eurodance music project created by Christophe Chantzis and Erik Vanspauwen, with first singer Martine Theeuwen (aka Marsha), who also co-wrote and sang the song &quot;Castles in the Sky&quot;. Cindy Mertens was the second singer and can be seen in the music video for &quot;Castles in the Sky&quot;; her vocal contribution was limited to live performances only. In 2001, she was replaced by Annemie Coenen, who would become front singer of the project.

== History ==

The name Ian Van Dahl is derived from the names Jan Vandaal (Average Joe) and Roald Dahl.

The project&#x27;s first single was &quot;Castles in the Sky&quot;, with lyrics co-written and vocals performed by Martine Theeuwen. The single never became a major hit in Belgium but did very well in the European clubscene. With popularity peaking in party locations like Ibiza where the single got massive support from DJs like Tiësto and Armin van Buuren. This all led to the record being picked up by Dave Pearce, a BBC Radio 1 DJ, and owner of the English dance label Nulife. Many other countries followed and Castles in the Sky got licensed to over 65 countries with labels like Robbins Entertainment in the US and Central Station in Australia.

Thanks to the huge amount of radio airplay and DJ support, Castles in the Sky became a big hit in many countries around the world. Reaching No.3 on the UK Singles Chart while also spending seven weeks in the top 10 in the summer of 2001. The single had also managed to crossover onto the American Charts and reached the Billboard Hot 100 where it peaked at No.91. In 2021, 20 years after the original release, &quot;Castles in the Sky&quot; reached platinum status in the United Kingdom with sales surpassing 600,000 copies.

The follow-up singles, recorded with Annemie Coenen, became major hits on the UK singles charts as well. The single &quot;Will I?&quot; peaked at No.5, &quot;Reason&quot; at No.8 and &quot;Try&quot; at No.15. The &quot;Ace&quot; album reached No.7 in the UK where it achieved Gold status.

Ace is an acronym for Annemie, Christophe and Erik, the first names of the 3 group members. The single Castles in the Sky was the biggest-selling dance single of the year in the UK. The album Ace became the biggest-selling dance album of the year in the UK. A unique achievement for a Belgian band.

In 2004, recordings of the second album &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; began with Belgian producers Peter Luts and David Vervoort joining Christophe Chantzis and Erik Vanspauwen for the production of this album. The album singles &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let You Go&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Where Are You Now?&quot; and &quot;Inspiration&quot; were all successful, but failed to match the massive commercial sales of the previous singles from the first album. Two final singles, &quot;Movin On&quot; and &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, were released in 2005 and 2006.

In 2008 Annemie Coenen decided to leave Ian Van Dahl and start her own solo project, AnnaGrace.

Christophe Chantzis, founder of the group and writer of the hits, is still touring the world performing as a DJ under the Ian Van Dahl banner.

<doc id="1116610" wikidata="Q8007190" url="?curid=1116610" title="William Coventry">
<text>Sir William Coventry (4 October 162723 June 1686) was an English statesman.

==Early life and Civil War==
William was the son of the lord keeper Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry, by his second wife Elizabeth Aldersley. Coventry matriculated at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, at the age of fourteen. Owing to the outbreak of the English Civil War he was forced to abandon his studies, but according to Sir John Bramston, the younger he had a good tutor, and through travelling, he learned to speak the French language fluently. He was young at the time of the war, yet Clarendon wrote that he joined the army and had the command of a foot company and shortly afterwards went to France. Here he remained till all hopes of obtaining foreign assistance and of raising a new army had to be laid aside when he returned to England and kept aloof from the various royalist intrigues. When the prospect of a restoration appeared in 1660, Coventry hurried to Breda, was appointed secretary to James, Duke of York (who was Lord High Admiral of England) and headed the royal procession when Charles II entered London in triumph.

==Restoration of the monarchy==
Coventry was returned to the Restoration Parliament of 1661 for Great Yarmouth, became commissioner for the navy in May 1662 and in 1663 was made Doctor of Civil Law at Oxford. His great talents were very soon recognised in parliament, and his influence as an official was considerable. His appointment was rather that of secretary to the admiralty than of personal assistant to the duke of York, and was one of large gains. Anthony Wood states that he collected a fortune of £60,000. Accusations of corruption in his naval administration, and especially during the Dutch war, were brought against him, but there is no real evidence for this. Samuel Pepys, in his diary, testifies to the excellence of Coventry&#x27;s administration and to his zeal for reform and economy; his consistent praise for Coventry is in notable contrast to his strictures on his other colleagues, who are generally referred to as &quot;knaves&quot; or &quot;old fools&quot;. Coventry&#x27;s ability and energy did little to avert the naval collapse, owing chiefly to financial mismanagement and ill-advised appointments.

==1665–1669==
Coventry denied all responsibility for the Dutch War in 1665, and his repudiation is supported by Pepys; it was, moreover, contrary to his well-known political opinions. The war greatly increased his influence, and shortly after the Battle of Lowestoft, on 3 June 1665, he was knighted and made a Privy Councillor (26 June) and was subsequently admitted to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 1667 he was appointed to the board of treasury to effect financial reforms. &quot;I perceive,&quot; writes Pepys on 23 August 1667, &quot;Sir William Coventry is the man and nothing done till he comes&quot;, and on his removal in 1669 the Duke of Albemarle, no friendly or partial critic, declares that &quot;nothing now would be well done.&quot; His appointment came too late to ward off the naval disaster at Chatham the same year, the Raid on the Medway, and the national bankruptcy in 1672.

Coventry&#x27;s rising influence had been from the first the cause of increasing jealousy to the Lord Chancellor, Clarendon, who disliked and discouraged the younger generation. Coventry resented this. He became the chief mover in the successful attack on Clarendon, but refused to take any part in his impeachment, although Clarendon never forgave him for what he saw as Coventry&#x27;s betrayal. Two days after Clarendon&#x27;s resignation (on 31 August), Coventry announced his intention of terminating his connection with the navy.

As a principal agent in effecting Clarendon&#x27;s fall, he naturally acquired new power and influence, and was expected to be Clarendon&#x27;s successor as first minister of the crown. Coventry retained merely his appointment at the treasury, and the brilliant but unscrupulous and incapable George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of the king, succeeded. The relations between the two men soon became unfriendly. Buckingham ridiculed Sir William&#x27;s steady attention to business, and was annoyed at his opposition to Clarendon&#x27;s impeachment. Coventry rapidly lost influence and was excluded from the cabinet council. His career depended now entirely on the support of the Duke of York: but ironically by bringing down Clarendon, Coventry had helped to weaken the influence of the Duke, Clarendon&#x27;s son-in-law and principal defender.

Finally, in March 1669, Coventry challenged Buckingham for having written a play in which Sir William was ridiculed. Notice of the challenge reached the authorities through the duke&#x27;s second, and Sir William was imprisoned in the Tower on 3 March and subsequently expelled from the privy council. He was superseded in the treasury on 11 March by Buckingham&#x27;s favourite, Sir Thomas Osborne, and was at last released from the Tower on 21 March in disgrace. The real cause of his dismissal was the final adoption by Charles of the policy of subservience to France and desertion of the Netherlands and Protestant interests. Six weeks before Coventry&#x27;s fall, the conference between Charles, James, Arlington, Clifford and Arundel had taken place, which resulted, a year and a half later in the Treaty of Dover. To such schemes, Sir William, with his steady hostility to France and active devotion to Protestantism, was doubtless a formidable opponent. He now withdrew definitely from official life, still retaining, however, his ascendancy in the House of Commons, and leading the party which condemned and criticised the reactionary and fatal policy of the government, his credit and reputation being rather enhanced than diminished by his dismissal.

==1670s==
In 1673 a pamphlet entitled &quot;England&#x27;s appeal from the Private Cabal at Whitehall to the Great Council of the Nation by a true Lover of his Country&quot; went through five editions. The anonymous work was universally ascribed to Sir William, and forcefully reflects his opinions on the French entanglement. In the great matter of the Indulgence, while refusing to discuss the limits of prerogative and liberty, he argued that the dispensing power of the crown could not be valid during the session of parliament, and criticised the manner of the declaration while approving its ostensible object. He supported the Test Act, but maintained a statesmanlike moderation amidst the tide of indignation rising against the government, and refused to take part in the personal attacks upon ministers, drawing upon himself the same unpopularity as his nephew, George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, incurred later. In the same year, he denounced the alliance with France. He showed his appreciation for the loyalty Samuel Pepys had always displayed to him by vigorously supporting Pepys&#x27; right to sit in the House of Commons (to which he was elected in 1673), and ridiculing the claims (which were entirely unfounded) that Pepys was a Roman Catholic.

During the summer of 1674, he was again received at court. In 1675 he supported the bill to exclude Roman Catholics from both Houses, and also the measure to close the House of Commons to ; and he showed great activity in his opposition to the French connection, especially stigmatising the encouragement given by the government to the levying of troops for the French service. In May 1677 he voted for the Dutch alliance. Like most of his contemporaries, he accepted the story of the Popish Plot in 1678. Coventry several times refused the highest court appointments, and he was not included in Sir W. Temple&#x27;s new-modelled council in April 1679.

==1680s==
In the exclusion question he favoured at first a policy of limitations, and on his nephew Halifax, who on his retirement became the leader of the moderate party, he enjoined prudence and patience, and greatly regretted the violence of the opposition which eventually excited a reaction and ruined everything. He refused to stand for the new parliament, and retired to his country residence at Minster Lovell near Witney, in Oxfordshire. He died unmarried on 23 June 1686, at Somerhill near Tunbridge Wells, where he had gone to take the waters, and was buried at Penshurst, where a monument was erected to his memory at St John the Baptist, Penshurst. In his will he ordered his funeral to be at small expense, and left £2000 to the French Protestant refugees in England, besides £3000 for the liberation of captives held by the Barbary Pirates in Algiers. He had shortly before his death already paid for the liberation of sixty slaves. He was much beloved and respected in his family circle, his nephew, Henry Savile, alluding to him in affectionate terms as &quot;our dearest uncle and incomparable friend&quot;.

==Assessment==
Writing Coventry&#x27;s biography in the Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, Philip Chesney Yorke stated that &quot;though Sir William Coventry never filled that place in the national administration to which his merit and exceptional ability clearly entitled him, his public life together with his correspondence are sufficient to distinguish him from amongst his contemporaries as a statesman of the first rank. Lord Halifax obviously derived from his honoured mentor those principles of government which, by means of his own brilliant intellectual gifts, originality and imaginative insight, gained further force and influence. Halifax owed to him his interest in the navy and his grasp of the necessity of a country of a powerful maritime force. He drew his antagonism to France, his religious tolerance, and wider religious views but firm Protestantism doubtless from the same source. Sir William was the original Trimmer&quot;.

Writing to his nephew Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, while denying the authorship of &quot;The Character of a Trimmer&quot;, he says, &quot;I have not been ashamed to own myself to be a trimmer... one who would sit upright and not overturn the boat by swaying too much to either side.&quot; He shared the Trimmers&#x27; dislike of party, urging Halifax in the exclusion contest not to be thrust by the opposition of his enemies into another party, but that he keep upon a national bottom which at length will prevail. His prudence was expressed in his perpetual unwillingness to do things which he could not undo. A singular independence of spirit, a breadth of mind which refused to be contracted by party formulas, a sanity which was proof against the contagion of national delirium, were equally characteristic of uncle and nephew. Sir William Coventry&#x27;s conceptions of statesmanship, under the guiding hand of his nephew, largely inspired the future revolution settlement, and continued to be an essential condition of English political growth and progress.

==Bibliography==
Besides the tract already mentioned, Coventry was the author of &quot;A Letter to Dr Burnet giving an Account of Cardinal Pools Secret Powers...&quot; (1685). &quot;The Character of a Trimmer&quot;, often ascribed to him, is now known to have been written by Lord Halifax. &quot;Notes concerning the Poor, and an essay concerning the decay of rents and the remedy&quot;, are among the &quot;Malet Papers&quot; (Hist. MSS. Comm. Ser. 5th Rep. app. 320 (a)) and &quot;Add. MSS. Brit. Mus.&quot; (cal. 1882–1887); &quot;an Essay concerning France&quot; (4th Rep. app. 229 (b)) and &quot;a Discourse on the Management of the Navy&quot; (23ob) are among the MSS. of the marquess of Bath, also a catalogue of his library (233(a)).

<doc id="1116613" wikidata="Q2133102" url="?curid=1116613" title="Smoke ring">
<text>A smoke ring is a visible vortex ring formed by smoke in a clear atmosphere.

Smokers may blow smoke rings from the mouth, intentionally or accidentally. Smoke rings may also be formed by sudden bursts of fire (such as lighting and immediately putting out a cigarette lighter), by shaking a smoke source (such as an incense stick) up and down, by firing certain types of artillery, or by the use of special devices, such as vortex ring guns and vortex ring toys. The head of a mushroom cloud is a large smoke ring.

A smoke ring is commonly formed when a puff of smoke is suddenly injected into clear air, especially through a narrow opening. The outer parts of the puff are slowed by the still air (or by edges of the opening) relative to the central part, imparting it the characteristic poloidal flow pattern.

The smoke makes the ring visible, but does not significantly affect the flow. The same phenomenon occurs with any fluid, producing vortex rings which are invisible but otherwise entirely similar to smoke rings.

Rare visible vortex rings produced by volcanoes have been incorrectly called &quot;smoke rings&quot;, despite being formed by the condensation of erupting steam, rather than by combustion.

==Smoking and breathing==

A smoker may produce rings by taking smoke into their mouth and expelling it with a tongue flick, by closing the jaw, tapping the cheek, or producing a sudden burst of air with the lungs and throat. The smoker may also use any of those methods to blow into a cloud of smoke outside their mouth.

A trick often performed in conjunction with mouth-blown smoke rings is the .

It is also possible to produce a vapour ring by using the same techniques on a cold day by exhaling.

The most famous such steam rings were those produced during the mid-20th century by Douglas Leigh&#x27;s billboard on the Hotel Claridge in New York City&#x27;s Times Square, advertising Camel cigarettes. An automated steam chamber behind the billboard produced puffs of steam every four seconds, giving the appearance of smoke rings leaving the smoker&#x27;s open mouth and drifting away. Inspired by a World War II-era prohibition on lighted advertising, the Camel smoker remained a Times Square landmark long afterwards.

Some users of electronic cigarettes modify their devices to inhale large amounts of vapour at once, to exhale &quot;clouds&quot; in patterns like smoke rings.

<text>3 of a Kind were a UK garage act, best known for their 2004 number one hit single, &quot;Baby Cakes&quot;. Its members were Liana Caruana (a.k.a. Miz Tipzta), Nicholas Gallante (a.k.a. MC Devine) and Marc Portelli. Marc and Liana met the day they recorded &quot;Baby Cakes&quot;.

==Career==
===2004: &quot;Baby Cakes&quot;===

&quot;Baby Cakes&quot; went straight to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and to number 3 on the Irish Singles Chart. It also just crept onto the Eurochart Hot 100 charting at number 91. The song also charted in Belgium, France, Netherlands and Sweden. 

===After Baby Cakes===
3 of a Kind never released a follow-up to &quot;Baby Cakes&quot;, making them one-hit wonders in the UK. A potential follow-up track, &quot;Wink One Eye&quot;, was put forward as the second single, but was pulled from the new release listings and never rescheduled.

Nicholas Gallante appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in November 2014, as part of the &quot;Identity Parade&quot; round and it was revealed he is now a party planner.

<text>The International Standard Identifier for Libraries and Related Organisations (ISIL), ISO 15511, assigns unique identifiers to libraries and related organisations, such as archives and museums.

The Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces is the international authority for maintaining the standard and its registry.

An ISIL is alphanumeric, with a maximum of 16 characters. Valid symbols are A-Z, 0-9, solidus (/), hyphen-minus and colon.

An ISIL consists of a prefix identifying the authority which issued the ISIL, a dash, and then an identifier issued by that authority. All two letter prefixes are reserved for the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, followed by an identifier assigned by that country&#x27;s national library authority. Global-level identifiers can also be assigned, which are not associated with a particular country, e.g. &#x27;oclc-&#x27; for the OCLC. The suffix is generally a pre-existing system of identifying libraries; thus, ISIL unifies existing systems around the world rather than instituting an entire system from scratch.

<text>Alice Fulton (born 1952) is an American author of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. Fulton is the Ann S. Bowers Professor of English Emerita at Cornell University. Her awards include the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature, National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, Library of Congress Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Award, the MacArthur Fellowship, an Ingram Merrill Foundation Award, as well as a Guggenheim Fellowship.

== Biography ==
Fulton was born and raised in Troy, New York, the youngest of three daughters. Her father was the proprietor of the historic Phoenix Hotel, and her mother was a visiting nurse. She began writing poetry in high school. In 1979 she attended a women&#x27;s poetry conference in Amherst, Mass., which she would later cite as a formative experience. While an undergraduate, she received competitive scholarships to study poetry with Thomas Lux at The Writers Community in New York City. In 1980 she married Hank De Leo and moved to Ithaca, New York, to study poetry under A. R. Ammons, Phyllis Janowitz, Kenneth McClane, and Robert Morgan in Cornell University&#x27;s Creative Writing Program. While at Cornell, her first book was selected by W. D. Snodgrass for the Associated Writing Program&#x27;s publication prize. After receiving her MFA, she was a fellow at The Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown. In 1983 Fulton moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for a three-year appointment as Fellow in the Michigan Society of Fellows. Mark Strand selected Fulton&#x27;s second book, &quot;Palladium&quot;, for publication in the 1985 National Poetry Series. In the interdisciplinary Society of Fellows she further developed her interest in using scientific metaphor and began her lifelong friendship with John H. Holland. She has often cited Holland&#x27;s writing on Complex Adaptive Systems as being instrumental in the development of her theory on Fractal Poetics [see Fulton&#x27;s prose collection]. It was also where she met the composers William Bolcom and Enid Sutherland. In 1991 Fulton was awarded a MacArthur &quot;Genius Grant&quot; Fellowship.

In addition to poetry, Fulton has written essays and criticism and has been widely praised for her finely crafted and emotionally powerful short fiction. &quot;The Nightingales of Troy&quot; collects the ten stories she had published before 2008. Two of those stories were selected for inclusion in &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;. Three contemporary authors share the distinction of appearing in both &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; and &quot;The Best American Poetry&quot; series: Alice Fulton, Lydia Davis, and Stuart Dybek.

Alice Fulton was a senior fellow in the Michigan Society of Fellows from 1996 to 2000. She remained at University of Michigan until 2002, when she returned to Ithaca as the Ann S. Bowers Distinguished Professor of English at Cornell University. In 2011 she received an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature. The Library of Congress awarded Fulton the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt Award in 2002. In 2004 she was the Holloway Lecturer in the Practice of Poetry at University of California, Berkeley, and in 2010 she was the George Elliston Poet at University of Cincinnati. She has also been a visiting professor at University of California, Los Angeles, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and a number of other universities.

== Works ==
Fulton&#x27;s poetics &quot;challenges the conventional wisdom among many poets that the content of a poem is less important than its form. In practice, Fulton has created a poetic style that is remarkably &quot;about things&quot; in the sense that her poems explore their overt subject matter deeply and uphold their convictions with rigor. &quot;Cascade Experiment&quot; ... amply demonstrates not only Fulton&#x27;s broad range of interests but also her continual and evolving sense of how to use the most seemingly insignificant details to illuminate the nuances of difficult moral ideas.&quot;

-- Sarah Cohen
Alice Fulton has suggested that poetry is a &quot;model of the way the world works&quot;. Her poetry has been described as &quot;intricately crafted, yet expansive — even majestic — in its scope and vision. One senses there is something startling about to be revealed in these poems, and indeed that mystery or tension often resolves in powerful acts of linguistic reckoning, as if a piece of psychological origami were unfolding before our eyes.&quot; The editors of &quot;Twentieth-Century American Poetry&quot; suggest that &quot;In her drive to freshen poetic diction, avoid cliche and sentimentality, and create &#x27;skewed domains‚&#x27; in her poetry, Fulton has distinguished herself as one of the most original American poets writing today. She has succeeded in challenging not only assumptions about gender roles, but also the assumptions underlying current modes of poetry such as the autobiographical, first-person lyric or the experimental &#x27;Language poem.&#x27;&quot;

In his introduction to Fulton&#x27;s first book, &quot;Dance Script With Electric Ballerina&quot;, W. D. Snodgrass reads Fulton&#x27;s poetry as a rare example of &quot;logopoeia&quot; (&quot;the dance of the intellect among words&quot;) and writes that &quot;we are always engaged by ... the sense of linguistic virtuosity ... a constant delight ... in language textures, the every-shifting shock and jolt of an electric surface.&quot;
&quot;Newsday&quot;, called it an &quot;extremely impressive poetic debut‚&quot; and a &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reviewer wrote, &quot;Reading her poems is something like listening to a set of the most spirited and peculiar jazz: you must sharpen your spirit to be moved by what is uncanny and rare.&quot; While most critical response to this debut volume was positive, conservative critics were &quot;more guarded, or even catty.&quot;

Her second collection consolidated the &quot;polyphonic textures,&quot; shifts in diction, and signature enjambments that have become hallmarks of her poetry. &quot;Palladium&quot; is structured in six parts, each focused on the etymology of &quot;palladium&quot; with the trope carried to Ellen Foscue Johnson&#x27;s palladium photographic print on the cover. One review explained the organizing structure this way: &quot;Etymology breeds metaphor; palladium generates the imagery and energy of the poems, informing them all without necessarily intruding upon them. The organizing principle of an Alice Fulton poem allows for cohesiveness yet is not so narrow or restrictive as to inhibit the flow of associations and ideas. It&#x27;s as though the world itself were endowed with a centrifugal force, enabling the poet to branch out in numerous directions — parallel lines that manage to intersect on their separate paths to infinity.&quot; Sven Birkerts, noting Fulton&#x27;s &quot;irrepressible inventiveness&quot; and &quot;startling juxtapositions,&quot; named this an &quot;aesthetic of profusion.&quot; Critics praised these &quot;compressed poems of great texture and inventiveness,&quot; as &quot;prepossessing and formidable,&quot; &quot;hardwon and solid.&quot; &quot;Palladium&quot; was admired for its &quot;energy and passion for specificity,&quot; its &quot;wit and unpredictable, wildly heterogenous combinations,&quot; the way &quot;surface and substance, style and content, coexist and are often at odds with one another.&quot; Peter Stitt described the style of &quot;Palladium&quot; as having &quot;so much texture, thanks to [Fulton&#x27;s] images and to her use of words, and that texture places a palpable surface on the abstract construct of the poem.&quot; Many critics praised Fulton&#x27;s &quot;energy,&quot; but Calvin Bedient and others were hostile toward the &quot;wicked intelligence&quot; in &quot;Palladium.&quot; Fulton defiantly included these criticism in the hand-written marginal comments of her innovative &quot;Point of Purchase&quot; in &quot;Powers of Congress&quot;. Rita Dove in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; described it as &quot;a wry sendup of academics, featuring a bona-fide poem littered with marginalia from different critics, each with distinct personalities, literary persuasions and handwriting.&quot; Stephen Behrendt commented that this poem &quot;comes with its own set of marginal annotations by (and in) several different hands. Not since Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; has a long poem presented the reader with so remarkable an example of this particular phenomenon.&quot;

Fulton has often referred to Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;I am large, I contain multitudes&quot; as a guiding principle for postmodern verse. David Baker, in reference to the multiplicity of experience evident in &quot;Powers Of Congress,&quot; wrote that &quot;Fulton is embarked on a project to redefine or recreate poetry according to the multiforms of experience and intellect, rather than to shape experience by modeling it on a received poetic vision.&quot; For Larissa Szporluk, Fulton&#x27;s &quot;truly phenomenal poetics leave me where I&#x27;ve never been, changing the rules of the game of poetry completely.&quot; Lawrence Joseph instructs Fulton&#x27;s reader to &quot;expect a vision of American society — its technological, sexual, class, and religious relationships and context — embodied in language conscientiously intelligent and physical.&quot; Commenting on how Fulton&#x27;s treatment of the &quot;real world is never treated only as an exercise in &#x27;realism&#x27;&quot; British poet Rodney Pybus notes the &quot;blessedly unpredictable and unconventional&quot; nature of her use of &quot;psychic and social turmoil.&quot; David Barber argues that Fulton&#x27;s &quot;expansiveness&quot; of subject is realized in &quot;poems that binge not just on language but on lexicons and argots, poems that lift their riffs not only from the deep wells of the American vernacular but from the streamlined vaults of newfangled technology and scientific determinism.&quot; &quot;Powers of Congress&quot; contains many examples of her signature use of polyphony and word superclusters which Fulton has described in interviews and in a 1990 essay on her own poetics, &quot;To Organize A Waterfall.&quot;

&quot;Sensual Math&quot; introduced Fulton&#x27;s invention of the double-equal or bride sign (see Poetics below). Dorothy Barresi claimed that this work is &quot;what great poetry must do and be&quot; and that &quot;Fulton&#x27;s poems are like no one else&#x27;s today‚&quot; with their &quot;on-again, off-again elasticity — a stretching smoothness to some lines, and a snapped back, taut quality to others — that manages to sound both eloquent and scared.&quot; Barresi concluded that &quot;Fulton writes with fiery intelligence, and unapologetically so, for it is in the acts of thinking and rethinking that this poet believes we stave off the brute world&#x27;s numbing assault.&quot; Stephen Yenser remarked, &quot;Hers is a maximalist poetry, exploding beyond its boundaries.&quot;

Many critics have praised the aural dimension of Fulton&#x27;s poetry. Writing about &quot;Sensual Math,&quot; Larissa Szporluk asserted that &quot;Fulton&#x27;s acoustic signals reign, giving the impression that behind their creation lies some kind of unimaginable technology, telepathic jazz, or just plain genius.&quot; Edward Falco corroborated, &quot;Her poems, spoken out loud or &#x27;heard&#x27; in the process of reading, offer a subtle, magnificent jazz: a music for the intellect, felt on the tongue and in the body, resonating in the mind. And nowhere is the music of Fulton&#x27;s poetry more stirring than in &quot;Sensual Math.&quot;&quot; &quot;Sensual Math&quot; contained a long sequence &quot;reimagining Daphne and Apollo.&quot; Donald Riggs writes helpfully about Fulton&#x27;s translation from the Latin and concludes, &quot;It is within this larger and deeper context that Ovid&#x27;s tale of Daphne and Apollo takes on, in Fulton&#x27;s version, an expanded significance: that of the suppression of women&#x27;s power by the Indo-Aryan patriarchal culture.&quot; Building on the music within the poems, the composer Enid Sutherland produced a monumental operatic scoring of this sequence that runs nearly two and one-half hours.

Writing about &quot;Felt&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Book Review,&quot; Megan Harlan also commented on how Fulton&#x27;s poems are &quot;aurally rich with slant rhymes and musical rhythms.&quot; The wordplay present in Fulton&#x27;s earliest poems has by now become thoroughly suffused:

In Alice Fulton&#x27;s poetry, those charged instances when the literal and the metaphysical (and the sensual and the philosophical) overlap are often mediated by wordplay — a pun, a double entendre, a witty turn of phrase. The title of her marvelous fifth collection, &quot;Felt,&quot; is meant to signify both an emotion once experienced [and] the fabric constructed by fibers that are forcibly pressed, rather than woven, together.

Carol Muske-Dukes has asserted that Fulton&#x27;s &quot;poetic intuition is a kind of apperceptive proof — never false,&quot; concluding that &quot;Felt&quot; is &quot;fetishistic, wildly associative, demonically apt and simply eloquent, calling to mind Max Planck&#x27;s quote about the purpose of science as an &#x27;unresting endeavor&#x27; developing toward a vision which &#x27;poetic intuition may apprehend, but which the intellect can never fully grasp.&#x27; &quot; Selected from all poetry books published in the United States in 2000 and 2001, &quot;Felt&quot; was praised by the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt Award committee as &quot;Full of animated, charged poems.&quot; The statement also noted that &quot;Felt&quot; sizzles with logophilia and tropes, is blessed with the kind of direct wiring between sensation and language, feeling and form, that strikes first with physical and then with intellectual and emotional wallop. Hers is a poetic sensibility at once remarkably comprehensive and remarkably precise, and felt; her best book so far is possessed of great velocity, great staying-power.&quot; &quot;Felt&quot; was also selected by the Los Angeles Times as one of the Best Books of 2001.

As with her poetry collections, Fulton&#x27;s first fiction collection is carefully constructed from interwoven parts &quot;playing off and enhancing the meaning of one another.&quot;

What sets &quot;The Nightingales of Troy&quot; apart from so many other precocious debut collections is Fulton&#x27;s knack for the ineffable, for creating stories that are more than the sum of their intricately assembled parts. Her best stories not only exhibit her architectural prowess, they also remind the reader of the near-magical capaciousness of the story form.

Donna Seaman notes that &quot;Fulton displays extraordinary verve in the originality of the predicaments she creates for her irresistible characters, her evocation of the majesty of the land and the rise and decline of the town, and her ravishingly inventive language&quot; and that she draws &quot;brilliantly on the vernacular and ambience of each decade.&quot; &quot;Fulton&#x27;s prose thrives on the tactile, and, as in her poetry, the language is brilliantly precise. While often rooted in the physical, Fulton&#x27;s narration frequently moves beyond the immediate, both powerfully and subtly.&quot;

==Poetics==
Fulton&#x27;s &quot;fingerprint-distinct voice&quot; is immediately recognizable for its poetic ambition laced with humor and shifting poetic diction. While sharing an interest in scientific metaphors and diction with her mentor, A.R. Ammons, she differs from Ammons through her engagement with injustice and cruelty. In a statement accompanying her selection of Lisa F. Jackson&#x27;s film, &quot;The Greatest Silence,&quot; for the 2008 &quot;Revolution&quot; writers conference and film festival at University of North Dakota, Fulton had this to say about her poetics:

As a poet and writer, I&#x27;m committed to undermining postures of arrogance and entitlement, the context of &quot;impunity&quot; [depicted in &quot;The Greatest Silence&quot;]. Silence — especially enforced silence – has been one of my deep subjects, as has resistance, a quality as important to poetics as to revolutions. I&#x27;ve tried to engage with the background rather than the figure, to find new linguistic ways of confronting disenfranchisement, cruelty, and suffering, while retaining the uncanny qualities of poetry. I&#x27;ve tried to be a student of inconvenient knowledge — the sort of knowledge that, when taken to heart, forces us to change our lives in revolutionary ways.

Sacred, religious, spiritual, compassionate, and ethical themes are incorporated in her work. Miller has noted that &quot;faith&quot; is an &quot;issue that comes up in all of [Fulton&#x27;s] volumes and in poem after poem,&quot; as have Marchant and others. Peter Brier asserts that &quot;Fulton conveys much of the ecstasy that is associated with the strongest religious poets, poets such as Gerard Manley Hopkins&quot; with similarities in phrasing, imagery, and sprung rhythm. Camille Paglia also finds &quot;heavy sprung rhythms ... reminiscent of the poet-priest Gerard Manley Hopkins&quot; and that Fulton&#x27;s &quot;ecstatic techniques&quot; are deployed &quot;for far earthier and more carnal purposes.&quot;

&quot;Like the Language poets, Fulton is interested in linguistic play and artifice, and also in critical theory and philosophy, although the theories most evident in her poetry and essays are those of science and mathematics.&quot; &quot;From the first,&quot; Fulton &quot;has been as theoretically astute as the Language poets&quot; as well as being interested in a poetry that will &quot;discomfit readers and unsettle their expectations, a poetry of &quot;inconvenient&quot; knowledge,&quot; a phrase originally used in Fulton&#x27;s 1997 essay.

Fulton first proposed her ideas for a new poetics based on the concepts of fractals and emergent patterns in her 1986 essay, &quot;Of Formal, Free, and Fractal Verse: Singing the Body Eclectic,&quot; in which she uses the term &quot;fractal&quot; to suggest &quot;a way to think about the hidden structures of free verse.&quot; Tigerlily states that Fulton &quot;coined the phrase &#x27;fractal poetry&#x27; as a method of revisioning the value of both formal and free verse, calling the &#x27;poetry of irregular form fractal verse.&#x27;&quot; Some critics have taken Fulton to task for an inexact usage of &quot;fractal.&quot; Other critics have countered that her use of &quot;fractal&quot; is more metaphorical than literal. Susan Duhig in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; noted that &quot;For Fulton, the fractal serves as a potent metaphor for a poetry with a form that exists somewhere between utter shapelessness and the Euclidean order of regular meter and genre, a poetry whose volatile, irregular patterning exists on the threshold of structure.&quot; Duhig concluded that Fulton&#x27;s essays explicate &quot;one possible language for understanding poetry in the age of quantum mechanics.&quot; Biogeneticist Ana Marti-Subirana writes at length and with specificity on how &quot;Chaos theory and fractal poetics allow Fulton to analyze the complexity of social structures and cultural constructions through new perspectives in poetic form.&quot; Fulton&#x27;s fractal poetics operates &quot;as a means to engage both the poet and the reader of poetry into an intellectual immersion beyond the obvious.&quot;

Fulton elaborated on her conceptualization of fractal verse in her 1996 essay, &quot;Fractal Amplifications: Writing in Three Dimensions,&quot; in which she posits a &quot;poem plane,&quot; a concept analogous to the picture plane in painting. She suggests that &quot;By juxtaposing transparent with textured passages, fractal poetry constructs a linguistic screen that alternately dissolves and clouds.&quot; This later fractal essay shows evidence of her conversations with Holland on the subject of complexity. Fulton has stated that John H. Holland&#x27;s work in complexity theory &quot;greatly affected my poetics in the nineties.&quot; A full description of Fractal Verse is beyond the scope of this article; both of the seminal essays are reprinted in Fulton&#x27;s prose collection. A third essay titled &quot;Fractal Poetics: Adaptation and Complexity&quot; was published in 2005 in &quot;Interdisciplinary Science Reviews&quot; (UK) with this summary:

Barbara Fischer&#x27;s analysis of Fulton&#x27;s ekphrastic poem &quot;Close&quot; in &quot;Felt&quot; explains this maximalist approach:

Fulton&#x27;s mixture of media is edgy and experimental — &quot;This is not an illustration.&quot; She stands close enough to her subjects to see that art, visual or verbal, is adulterated by evidence of the processes that have made it. The museum-goer notes that &quot;In person, [the painting] looked a little dirty. / I could see the artist&#x27;s hairs / in the pigment—traces of her / head or dog or brush.&quot; She sees &quot;gooey gobs of / process painted in,&quot; and notes Mitchell&#x27;s knifework, which has &quot;left some gesso showing through, / a home for lessness that— / ... / is a form of excess.&quot; This paradoxical excess of absence describes a characteristic feature in Fulton&#x27;s work, here and in earlier books — a lavish and roiling expenditure of imagery and wordplay that draws attention to the means by which any representational illusion of plenitude is sustained. Critics have emphasized the &quot;excesses&quot; of Fulton&#x27;s vivacious artifice, digressiveness, and heterogeneous diction (I would agree with those who do not consider such &quot;excess&quot; pejorative), and &quot;Felt&quot; ... powerfully investigates the emotional stakes of this &quot;form of excess&quot; as a poetics.

Reviewing &quot;Powers Of Congress&quot; in 1991, Eavan Boland was the first to liken Fulton to Emily Dickinson. With the 1995 publication of &quot;Sensual Math,&quot; Publishers Weekly suggested &quot;[Fulton] may be Dickinson&#x27;s postmodern heir.&quot; Critic and Dickinson scholar Cristanne Miller further expounded on similarities between Dickinson and Fulton: &quot;Like Dickinson, Fulton crosses the boundaries of popular and highly experimental genres of poetry writing ... Even in long poems and sequences of poems, Fulton&#x27;s verse has the tight constructedness and multiple layered qualities of Dickinson&#x27;s poetry ... Fulton shares Dickinson&#x27;s outrageous sense of play with both cultural icons and aspects of English normally taken for granted.&quot; Miller also has pointed to Fulton&#x27;s kinship with Dickinson in the use of end-of-line syntactic doubling, and was the first critic to note similarities in punctuation.

Where Dickinson makes the dash key to the rhythms and expression of her poetry, Fulton introduces a new sign of punctuation that she calls &#x27;a bride / after the recessive threads in lace&#x27; [= =]. This double-equal sign, which &#x27;might mean immersion,&#x27; is &#x27;the unconsidered // mortar&#x27; between bricks; it makes &#x27;visible the acoustic signals / of things about to flame,&#x27; &#x27;hinging one phrase to the next,&#x27; throwing the reader into the same kind of adventurous uncertainty as Dickinson&#x27;s dash.

Miller goes on to say, &quot;For both poets, this interest in hinges, in connections, in incongruities and contiguities reveals itself in verbal and syntactical structures as well as in themes. In short, while these are poets of big ideas, they also are very much poets of language ... Like Dickinson, Fulton makes us see the pomposity, ridiculousness, and fragility of our beliefs, hopes, and attitudes as well as the sometimes terrible wonder of human interaction and the universe beyond ourselves.&quot; In addition to Dickinson&#x27;s influence, Mark Jarman and Cristanne Miller have noted the influence of Marianne Moore. Rita Dove has written that &quot;Nabokov is one of Alice Fulton&#x27;s literary mentors: The sheer delight in language&#x27;s subterfuges, the knotty avenues of recollections and desire, the human need for &#x27;significance&#x27; that forms narratives even where there are none — these themes are the very bone and gristle of Fulton&#x27;s prodigal, energetic poetry.&quot;

Many critics have commented on Fulton&#x27;s command of scientific metaphor. Marti-Subirana asserted that &quot;Alice Fulton&#x27;s poetry stands as one of the most representative examples of intellectual exchange between contemporary experimental poetics and modern science — as represented by quantum physics, chaos theory and complexity theory.&quot; Marti-Subirana has elaborated on Fulton&#x27;s use of &quot;Complexity theory and Darwinism‚&quot; and has identified a dimension of Fulton&#x27;s work that she calls &quot;Fulton&#x27;s &quot;poetry of emergence.&quot;&quot; &quot;This dimension examines individual and collective emotions (such as detachment and compassion), and behavioral patterns (such as cruelty) from the perspective of emergence and emergent patterns.&quot; &quot;Emergence‚&quot; is a central tenet of John H. Holland&#x27;s description of Complex Adaptive Systems.

Harvard mathematician Barry Mazur has written about Fulton&#x27;s poetics and its relation to the &quot;science of connections bridging differences.&quot; Mazur claims that Fulton engages with mathematics as the &quot;science of the subtle glues ... that bind different ideas together, and yet keep them distinguished.&quot; He noted that &quot;The very connectors themselves come out into the open in the poem entitled &#x27;= =.&#x27; &quot;
&quot;Sensual Math&quot; contains a number of poems that deploy and define her &quot;bride sign.&quot; As with all of Fulton&#x27;s books, including her fiction and nonfiction prose, &quot;Sensual Math&quot; is a carefully constructed web of interrelated parts that form an organic whole. One critic predicted that &quot;&quot;Sensual Math&quot; might well come to be seen as one of the most significant volumes of the 1990s.&quot;

Writing about the double-equal sign, Lynn Keller commented,

Her inventive work, which stretches the linguistic, tonal, vocal, and emotional range of contemporary lyric, points ultimately to resources that lie between recognized categories, in liminal states, and at the cultural margins as offering hope for significant social and aesthetic change. Her double equal sign and other rejections of patriarchal binaries aim ... to counter the destructive othering that pervades all aspects of our lives ...

Physicist Karen Barad&#x27;s book, &quot;Meeting the Universe Halfway,&quot; takes its title from Alice Fulton&#x27;s poem &quot;Cascade Experiment,&quot; first published in 1989. Gabriel Mckee, comments that the poem &quot;contains this compelling passage:

&quot;The poem is a wonderful combination of science and faith, and finds mystery in empiricism.&quot; Mckee continues, saying that the poem reminds him &quot;of the 14th-century mystical text The Cloud of Unknowing, the title of which offers perhaps the most famous illustration of apophatic theology ... Fulton&#x27;s poem makes an eloquent and moving case for science that seeks the unknowable, the unbelievable, and the impossible.&quot;

Fulton&#x27;s formal inventions invariably employ &quot;form&quot; in the service of content. She has stated that &quot;During the act of writing, technique and meaning are inextricably linked, and it is only for the convenience of critical discussion that one could wish to separate them. The realization that craft depends on content leads to the concept of organic form and the idea that whatever elements help us experience a poem as a whole can be called its form.&quot; In an essay concerned with the body poems of Anne Sexton and Alice Fulton, Deborah Landau asserts that &quot;Fulton&#x27;s forms often reinforce the discursive claims of her poems.&quot; The editors of &quot;20th Century Poetics&quot; point to &quot;active enjambments&quot; in Fulton&#x27;s work &quot;that make words do double duty as different parts of speech.&quot; Peter Brier says that Fulton uses enjambment‚ &quot;to sharpen her phrasing, which in turn is remarkably sure and strengthened by the vividness of her imagery.&quot; Fulton has stated in interviews that she tries to &quot;think freshly about the why of every line&quot; and how to make &quot;meaning shift at enjambments without the end word in the line changing its part of speech.&quot; Another of Fulton&#x27;s techniques is that &quot;she often refuses to gender her speakers, forcing her readers to reconsider their assumptions about what constitutes male or female identity.&quot;

Throughout her career, Fulton has juxtaposed references to popular culture with allusions to literary and high culture. Ernest Smith has argued that a &quot;significant theme in Fulton&#x27;s work is the relationship among the individual, imagination, and culture, both historically constructed aspects of culture and contemporary, popular culture.&quot; Smith also comments on Fulton&#x27;s &quot;polyphonic texture&quot; as &quot;a sense of multiplying resonance akin to the use of counterpoint in music.&quot;
