<text>The siege of Antioch took place during the First Crusade in 1097 and 1098, on the crusaders&#x27; way to Jerusalem through Syria. Two sieges took place in succession. The first siege, by the crusaders against the city held by the Seljuk Empire, lasted from 20 October 1097 to 3 June 1098. The second siege, of the crusader-held city by a Seljuk relieving army, lasted three weeks in June 1098, leading to the Battle of Antioch in which the crusaders defeated the relieving army led by Kerbogha. The crusaders then established the Principality of Antioch, ruled by Bohemond of Taranto.

Antioch (modern Antakya) lay in a strategic location on the crusaders&#x27; route to Judea through the Syrian Coastal mountain range. Supplies, reinforcements and retreat could all be controlled by the city. Anticipating that it would be attacked, the Seljuk governor of the city, Yağısıyan, began stockpiling food and sending requests for help. The Byzantine walls surrounding the city presented a formidable obstacle to its capture, but the leaders of the crusade felt compelled to besiege Antioch anyway.

The crusaders arrived outside the city on 21 October and began the siege. The garrison sortied unsuccessfully on 29 December. After stripping the surrounding area of food, the crusaders were forced to look farther afield for supplies, opening themselves to ambush. On 31 December, a force of 20,000 crusaders encountered a relief army led by Duqaq, ruler of Damascus, heading to Antioch and defeated them. As the siege went on, supplies dwindled and in early 1098 one in seven of the crusaders was dying from starvation, and people began deserting.

A second relief force, this time under the command of Duqaq&#x27;s brother Ridwan, emir of Aleppo, advanced towards Antioch, arriving on 9 February. Like the army of Duqaq before, it was defeated. Antioch was captured on 3 June, although the citadel remained in the hands of the Turkish defenders. Kerbogha, atabeg of Mosul, began the second siege, against the crusaders who had occupied Antioch, which lasted from 7 to 28 June 1098. The second siege ended when the crusaders exited the city to engage Kerbogha&#x27;s army in battle on 28 June and succeeded in defeating them. On seeing the Turkish army routed, the defenders remaining in the citadel surrendered.

==Background==
There are a number of contemporaneous sources relating to the siege of Antioch and the First Crusade. There are four narrative accounts: those of Fulcher of Chartres, Peter Tudebode, and Raymond of Aguilers, and the anonymous &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;. Nine letters survive relating to or from the crusading army; five of them were written while the siege was underway and another in September, not long after the city had been taken.

While there are many sources the number of people on crusade is unclear because they fluctuated regularly and many non-combatants on pilgrimage accompanied the soldiers. Historian Jonathan Riley-Smith offers a rough guide, suggesting that perhaps 43,000 people (including soldiers, armed poor, and non-combatants) were involved in the siege of Nicaea in June 1097, while as few as 15,000 may have taken part in the siege of Jerusalem in July 1099.

Lying on the slopes of the Orontes Valley, in 1097 Antioch covered more than and was encircled by walls studded by 400 towers. The river ran along the city&#x27;s northern wall before entering Antioch from the northwest and exiting east through the northern half of the city. Mount Silpius, crested by a citadel, was Antioch&#x27;s highest point and rose some above the valley floor. There were six gates through which the city could be entered: three along the northern wall, and one on each of the south, east, and west sides.

The valley slopes made approaching from the south, east, or west difficult, so the most practical access route for a large number of people was from the north across flatter ground. The city&#x27;s defences dated from the reign of the Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century. Though Antioch changed hands twice between then and the arrival of the crusaders in 1097, each time it was the result of betrayal rather than inadequacy of the defences.

After the Byzantine Empire reconquered Antioch in 969 a programme of fortification building was undertaken in the surrounding area to secure the gains. As part of this, a citadel was built on Mount Silpius in Antioch. High enough to be separate from the city below, historian Hugh Kennedy opined that it &quot;[relied] on inaccessibility as its main defence&quot;. At its fall to Seljuk dynasty in 1085, Antioch was the last Byzantine fortification in Syria. Yaghi-Siyan was made Governor of Antioch in 1087 and held the position when the crusaders arrived in 1097.

Yaghi-Siyan was aware of the approaching crusader army as it marched through Anatolia in 1097; the city stood between the crusaders and Palestine. Though under Turkish control, the majority of Antioch&#x27;s inhabitants were Christians. Yaghi-Siyan had previously been tolerant of the Christian populace, however that changed as the crusaders approached. To prepare for their arrival he imprisoned the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, John the Oxite, turned St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral into a stable and expelled many leading Christians from the city. Yaghi-Siyan then sent out appeals for help: his request was turned down by Ridwan of Aleppo because of personal animosity, however Yaghi-Siyan was more successful in his approaches to other nobles in the region and Duqaq of Damascus, Toghtekin, Kerbogha, the sultans of Baghdad and Persia, and the emir of Homs all agreed to send reinforcements. Meanwhile, back in Antioch Yaghi-Siyan began stockpiling supplies in anticipation of a siege.

Knowing they had to capture Antioch, the crusaders considered how best to go about the task. Attrition suffered during the army&#x27;s long journey across Anatolia meant the leaders considered leaving an assault until reinforcements arrived in spring. Tatikios, the Byzantine advisor to the crusade, suggested adopting tactics similar to those used by the Byzantines themselves when they moved to capture Antioch in 968. They had installed themselves at Baghras some away and from there conducted a blockade of the city by cutting off its lines of communication. Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, was alone in advocating assaulting the city. In the end, the crusaders chose to advance on Antioch and establish a siege close to Antioch.

==First siege==

===Starting the siege===
Before the siege could be properly started, the control of three key sites was essential: the town of Artah, the Iron Bridge across the Orontes, as well as the harbour of St Simeon. Artah&#x27;s importance resulted from its strategic position as it was situated on vital routes connecting the Euphrates and the Orontes valleys as well as Apamea, Aleppo and Antioch. A detachment of the crusade army led by Robert of Flanders was sent to take the city but discovered that the local Armenian population had ejected the Turkish garrison and welcomed Robert and his forces with supplies for men and horses. Yaghi-Siyan then sent a force to retake Artah but this force retreated upon arrival of the main army of the crusaders.

On 20 October 1097 the crusaders reached the Iron Bridge, a fortified crossing on the Orontes River outside Antioch. Robert II, Count of Flanders and Adhemar of Le Puy, the Catholic Bishop of Puy-en-Velay, led the charge across the bridge, opening the way for the advancing army. Bohemond of Taranto took a vanguard along the river&#x27;s south bank and headed towards Antioch on 21 October and the crusaders established themselves outside the city&#x27;s north wall. The crusaders divided into several groups. Bohemond camped outside Saint Paul&#x27;s Gate near the northernmost corner of the city walls and immediately to the west were Hugh I, Count of Vermandois; Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy; Robert II, Count of Flanders; and Stephen II, Count of Blois. Adhemar of Le Puy and Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, took up positions outside the Dog Gate either side of where the Orontes penetrated Antioch&#x27;s defences. Godfrey of Bouillon was stationed west of the Duke&#x27;s Gate in the northwest of the city walls. The bridge across the Orontes outside Antioch&#x27;s west walls remained under Yaghi-Siyan&#x27;s control at this point. The ensuing nine-month siege has been described as &quot;one of the great sieges of the age&quot;.
The sources emphasise that a direct assault would have failed. For instance, Raymond of Aguilers noted that the chaplain of Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, said &quot;[Antioch] is so well fortified that it need not fear attack by machinery nor the assault of man, even if all mankind came together against it&quot;. According to Fulcher of Chartres the leaders resolved to maintain the siege until the city was forced into submission. Though his figures may not be accurate, Raymond of Aguilers gave an account of the army defending the city: &quot;There were, furthermore, in the city two thousand of the best knights, and four or five thousand common knights and ten thousand more footmen&quot;.

One of the problems of camping so close to the city was that it left the besiegers vulnerable to sorties from the garrison and even missiles. For the first fortnight of the siege, the crusaders were able to forage in the surrounding area as the defenders chose not to leave the safety of the city walls. However, in November Yaghi-Siyan learned that the crusaders felt the city would not fall to an assault so was able to turn his attentions from the defensive to harrying the besiegers. He mobilised his cavalry and began harassing the besiegers. With the immediate area stripped clean, the crusaders&#x27; foraging parties had to search further afield for supplies leaving them more vulnerable and on several occasions were attacked by the garrisons of nearby fortifications. Yaghi-Siyan&#x27;s men also used the Dog Bridge, outside the Dog Gate to harass the crusaders. Adhemar of Le Puy and Raymond IV&#x27;s men, who were camped closest to the bridge, attempted to destroy it using picks and hammers, but made little impact on the strong structure while under missile fire from Antioch&#x27;s defenders. Another attempt was made to render the bridge unusable, this time with a mobile shelter to protect the crusaders, but the garrison sortied and successfully drove them away. Soon after, three siege engines were built opposite the Dog Gate. In the end, the crusaders erected a blockade on the bridge to obstruct potential sorties.

The port of St Symeon on the Mediterranean coast, west of Antioch would allow the crusaders to bring reinforcements. Raymond of Aguilers mentions that the English landed at the port before the crusade reached Antioch, but did not record whether a battle for control of St Symeon took place. Reinforcements in the form of thirteen Genoese ships reached St Symeon on 17 November, and though the route from Antioch to St Symeon ran close to the city walls, meaning the garrison could impede travel, joined up with the rest of the crusaders. According to the Genoese chronicler Caffaro di Rustico da Caschifellone, the Genoese suffered heavy casualties en route from St Symeon to Antioch. Bohemond&#x27;s troops built a counterfort outside Saint Paul&#x27;s Gate in Antioch&#x27;s northeast wall to protect themselves against missiles from Antioch&#x27;s defenders. Known as Malregard, the fort was built on a hill and probably consisted of earthen ramparts. The construction has been dated to around the time the Genoese arrived. The crusaders were further bolstered by the arrival of Tancred, who set up camp to the west of his uncle, Bohemond.

===Winter===
As the crusaders&#x27; food supply reached critical levels in December, Godfrey fell ill. On 28 December, Bohemond and Robert of Flanders took about 20,000 men and went foraging for food and plunder upstream of the Orontes. Knowing the crusaders&#x27; force had been divided, Yaghi-Siyan waited until the night of 29 December before making a sortie. He attacked Count Raymond&#x27;s encampment across the river, and though caught by surprise, Count Raymond was able to recover and turn Yaghi-Siyan&#x27;s men back. He almost succeeded in reversing the attack entirely, forcing a way across the bridge and establishing a foothold on the other side and holding open the city gates. As the crusaders threatened to take the city, a horse lost its rider and, in the ensuing confusion in the dark, the crusaders panicked and withdrew across the bridge with the Seljuks in pursuit. The stalemate was restored, and both sides had suffered losses.

While Count Raymond was repulsing a sally from Antioch&#x27;s garrison, an army under the leadership of Duqaq of Damascus was en route to relieve Antioch. Bohemond and Robert of Flanders were unaware that their foraging party was heading towards Duqaq&#x27;s men. On 30 December news reached Duqaq while his army was at Shaizar that the crusaders were nearby. On the morning of 31 December Duqaq marched towards Bohemond and Robert&#x27;s army and the two met at the village of Albara. Robert was the first to encounter Duqaq&#x27;s men as he was marching ahead of Bohemond. Bohemond joined the battle and with Robert fought back Duqaq&#x27;s army and inflicted heavy casualties. Though they fought off Duqaq&#x27;s army, which retreated to Hama, the crusaders suffered too many casualties to keep foraging and returned to Antioch. As a result of the fight the crusaders lost the flock they had gathered for food and returned with less food than they needed. The month ended inauspiciously for both sides: there was an earthquake on 30 December, and the following weeks saw such unseasonably bad rain and cold weather that Duqaq had to return home without further engaging the crusaders. The crusaders feared the rain and earthquake were signs they had lost God&#x27;s favour, and to atone for their sins such as pillaging, Adhemar of Le Puy ordered that a three-day fast should be observed. In any case at this time supplies were running dangerously low, and soon after one in seven men was dying of starvation.

Though local Christians brought food to the crusaders, they charged extortionate prices. The famine also affected the horses, and soon only 700 remained. The extent to which the crusader army was affected is difficult to gauge, but according to Matthew of Edessa one in five crusaders died from starvation during the siege and the poorer members were probably worse off. The famine damaged morale and some knights and soldiers began to desert in January 1098, including Peter the Hermit and William the Carpenter. On hearing of the desertion of such prominent figures, Bohemond despatched a force to bring them back. Peter was pardoned while William was berated and made to swear he would remain with the crusade.

===Spring===
The arrival of spring in February saw the food situation improve for the crusaders. That month Tatikios repeated his earlier advice to resort to a long-distance blockade but his suggestion was ignored; he then left the army and returned home. Tatikios explained to the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos that Bohemond had informed him that there was a plan to kill him, as they believed Alexios was secretly encouraging the Seljuks. Those close to Bohemond claimed that this was treachery or cowardice, reason enough to break any obligations to return Antioch to the Byzantines. News arrived that a Seljuk army was approaching and Bohemond used the situation to his advantage. He declared that he would leave unless he was allowed to keep Antioch for himself when it was captured. Knowing fully that Bohemond had designs on taking the city for himself, and that he had probably engineered Tatikios&#x27; departure in order to facilitate this, Godfrey and Raymond did not give in to his demands, but Bohemond gained the sympathies and cooperation of the minor knights and soldiers.
Yaghi-Siyan had reconciled with Ridwan of Aleppo and the advancing army was under his command. In early February news reached the besiegers that Ridwan had taken nearby Harim where he was preparing to advance on Antioch. At Bohemond&#x27;s suggestion, the crusaders sent all their cavalry (numbering about 700 knights) to meet the advancing army while the infantry remained behind in case Antioch&#x27;s defenders decided to attack. On the morning of 9 February, Ridwan moved towards the Iron Bridge. The crusaders had moved into position the previous night and charged the advancing army before it reached the bridge. The first charge caused few casualties, but Ridwan&#x27;s army followed the crusaders to a narrow battlefield. With the river on one side and the Lake of Antioch on the other, Ridwan was unable to outflank the crusaders and exploit his superior numbers. A second charge had more impact and the Seljuk army withdrew in disorder. At the same time, Yaghi-Siyan had led his garrison out of Antioch and attacked the crusader infantry. His offensive was forcing the besiegers back until the knights returned. Realising Ridwan had been defeated, Yaghi-Siyan retreated inside the city. As Ridwan&#x27;s army passed through Harim panic spread to the garrison he had installed there and they abandoned the town, which was retaken by the Christians.

According to Orderic Vitalis an English fleet led by Edgar Ætheling, the exiled Saxon claimant to the throne of England, arrived at St Symeon on 4 March carrying supplies from the Byzantines. Historian Steven Runciman repeated the assertion, however it is unknown where the fleet originated and would not have been under Edgar&#x27;s command. Regardless, the fleet brought raw materials for constructing siege engines, but these were almost lost on the journey from the port to Antioch when part of the garrison sallied out. Bohemond and Raymond escorted the material, and after losing some of the materials and 100 people, they fell back to the crusader camp outside Antioch. Before Bohemond and Raymond, rumours that they had been killed reached Godfrey who readied his men to rescue the survivors of the escort. However, his attention was diverted when another force sallied from the city to provide cover for the men returning from the ambush. Godfrey was able to hold off the attack until Bohemond and Raymond came to his aid. The reorganised army then caught up with the garrison before it had reached the safety of Antioch&#x27;s walls. The counter-attack was a success for the crusaders and resulted in the deaths of between 1,200 and 1,500 of Antioch&#x27;s defenders. The crusaders set to work building siege engines, as well as a fort, called La Mahomerie, to block the Bridge Gate and prevent Yaghi-Siyan attacking the crusader supply line from the ports of Saint Simon and Alexandretta, whilst also repairing the abandoned monastery to the west of the Gate of Saint George, which was still being used to deliver food to the city. Tancred garrisoned the monastery, referred to in the chronicles as Tancred&#x27;s Fort, for 400 silver marks, whilst Count Raymond of Toulouse took control of La Mahomerie. Finally the crusader siege was able to have some effect on the well-defended city. Food conditions improved for the crusaders as spring approached and the city was sealed off from raiders.

===Fatimid embassy===
In April a Fatimid embassy from Egypt arrived at the crusader camp, hoping to establish a peace with the Christians, who were, after all, the enemy of their own enemies, the Seljuks. Peter the Hermit was sent to negotiate. These negotiations came to nothing. The Fatimids, assuming the crusaders were simply mercenary representatives of the Byzantines, were prepared to let the crusaders keep Syria if they agreed not to attack Fatimid Palestine, a state of affairs perfectly acceptable between Egypt and Byzantium before the Turkish invasions. But the crusaders could not accept any settlement that did not give them Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the Fatimids were treated hospitably and were given many gifts, plundered from the Seljuks who had been defeated in March, and no definitive agreement was reached. Nevertheless, it taught the crusaders the value of diplomacy and they decided to send an embassy to Duqaq of Damascus asking for his neutrality, stating they had no ambitions on his territory. They were, however, rejected by Duqaq.

==Capture of Antioch==
The siege continued, and at the end of May 1098 a Turkish army from Mosul under the command of Kerbogha approached Antioch. This army was much larger than the previous attempts to relieve the siege. Kerbogha had joined with Ridwan and Duqaq and his army also included troops from Persia and from the Ortuqids of Mesopotamia. The crusaders were luckily granted time to prepare for their arrival, as Kerbogha had first made a three-week-long excursion to Edessa, which he was unable to recapture from Baldwin of Boulogne, who had becomes its ruler earlier in March 1098.

The crusaders concluded that they would have to take the city before Kerbogha arrived if they had any chance of survival. Weeks earlier, Bohemond had secretly established contact with someone inside the city named Firouz, an Armenian guard who controlled the Tower of the Two Sisters. Firouz&#x27;s motivation was unclear even to Bohemond, perhaps avarice or revenge, but he offered to let Bohemond into the city in exchange for money and a title. Bohemond then approached the other crusaders and offered access to the city, through Firouz, if they would agree to make Bohemond the Prince of Antioch. Raymond was furious and argued that the city should be handed over to Alexios, as they had agreed when they left Constantinople in 1097, but Godfrey, Tancred, Robert, and the other leaders, faced with a desperate situation, gave in to Bohemond&#x27;s demand.

Despite this, on 2 June, Stephen of Blois and some of the other crusaders deserted the army. Later on the same day, Firouz instructed Bohemond to feign a march south over the mountains to ostensibly confront Kerbogha, but then to double-back at night and scale the walls at the Tower of the Two Sisters where Firouz held watch. This was done. Firouz allowed a small contingent of crusaders to scale the tower (including Bohemond), who then opened a nearby postern gate allowing a larger contingent of soldiers hiding in the nearby rocks to enter the city and overwhelm the alerted garrison. While Bohemond attempted to capture the citadel and the remaining crusader soldiers fought the remaining Turkish defenders, the poorer crusaders seized everything they could in a disorderly manner. In the ensuing chaos, the Armenians and Greeks joined the crusaders in fighting the Turks they could find although the deaths also included many non-Turkish civilians, including Firouz&#x27;s own brother. Yaghi-Siyan fled but was captured by Armenian and Syrian Christians some distance outside the city and his severed head was brought to Bohemond.

==Second siege==

By the end of the day on 3 June, the crusaders controlled most of the city, except for the citadel, which remained in the hands of Yaghi-Siyan&#x27;s son Shams ad-Daulah. John the Oxite was reinstated as patriarch by Adhemar of Le Puy, the papal legate, who wished to keep good relations with the Byzantines, especially as Bohemond was clearly planning to claim the city for himself. However, the city was now short on food, and Kerbogha&#x27;s army was still on its way. Kerbogha arrived only two days later, on 5 June. He tried, and failed, to storm the city on 7 June, and by 9 June he had established his own siege around the city.

More crusaders had deserted before Kerbogha arrived, and they joined Stephen of Blois in Tarsus. Stephen had seen Kerbogha&#x27;s army encamped near Antioch and assumed all hope was lost; the deserters confirmed his fears. On the way back to Constantinople, Stephen and the other deserters met Alexios, who was on his way to assist the crusaders, and did not know they had taken the city and were now under siege themselves. Stephen convinced him that the rest of the crusaders were as good as dead, and Alexios heard from his reconnaissance that there was another Seljuk army nearby in Anatolia. He therefore decided to return to Constantinople rather than risking battle.

===Discovery of the Holy Lance===
Meanwhile, in Antioch, on 10 June an otherwise insignificant priest from southern France by the name of Peter Bartholomew came forward claiming to have had visions of St. Andrew, who told him that the Holy Lance was inside the city. The starving crusaders were prone to visions and hallucinations, and another monk named Stephen of Valence reported visions of Christ and the Virgin Mary. On 14 June a meteor was seen landing in the enemy camp, interpreted as a good omen. Although Adhemar was suspicious, as he had seen a relic of the Holy Lance in Constantinople, Raymond believed Peter. Raymond, Raymond of Aguilers, William, Bishop of Orange, and others began to dig in the cathedral of Saint Peter on 15 June, and when they came up empty, Peter went into the pit, reached down, and produced a spear point. Raymond took this as a divine sign that they would survive and thus prepared for a final fight rather than surrender. Peter then reported another vision, in which St. Andrew instructed the crusader army to fast for five days (although they were already starving), after which they would be victorious.

Bohemond was sceptical of the Holy Lance as well, but there is no question that its discovery increased the morale of the crusaders. It has also been suggested that the item Peter found was indeed an object which the local population believed to be the Holy Lance as Greek Orthodox sources document the possession and veneration of a Holy Lance in Antioch as early as the tenth century. It is also possible that Peter was reporting what Bohemond wanted (rather than what St. Andrew wanted) as Bohemond knew, from spies in Kerbogha&#x27;s camp, that the various factions frequently argued with each other. Kerbogha of Mosul was indeed suspected by most emirs to yearn for sovereignty in Syria and often considered as a bigger threat to their interests than the Christian invaders. On 27 June, Peter the Hermit was sent by Bohemond to negotiate with Kerbogha, but this proved futile and battle with the Seljuks was thus unavoidable. Bohemond drew up six divisions: he commanded one himself, and the other five were led by Hugh of Vermandois and Robert of Flanders, Godfrey, Robert of Normandy, Adhemar, and Tancred and Gaston IV of Béarn. Raymond, who had fallen ill, remained inside to guard the citadel with 200 men, now held by Ahmed ibn Merwan, an agent of Kerbogha.

==Battle of Antioch==
On Monday 28 June the crusaders emerged from the city gate, with Raymond of Aguilers carrying the Holy Lance before them. Kerbogha hesitated against his generals&#x27; pleadings, hoping to attack them all at once rather than one division at a time, but he underestimated their size. He pretended to retreat to draw the crusaders to rougher terrain, while his archers continuously pelted the advancing crusaders with arrows. A detachment was dispatched to the crusader left wing, which was not protected by the river, but Bohemond quickly formed a seventh division and beat them back. The Seljuks were inflicting many casualties, including Adhemar&#x27;s standard-bearer, and Kerbogha set fire to the grass between his position and the crusaders, but this did not deter them: they had visions of three saints riding along with them: St. George, St. Mercurius, and St. Demetrius. The battle was brief and disastrous for the Seljuk empire. Duqaq deserted Kerbogha, as did Soqman and the Emir of Homs and this desertion reduced the great numerical advantage the Turkish army had over its Christian opponents. Soon the defeated Turkish troops were in panicked retreat.

==Aftermath==

As Kerbogha fled, the citadel under command of Ahmed ibn Merwan finally surrendered, but only to Bohemond personally, rather than to Raymond; this seems to have been arranged beforehand without Raymond&#x27;s knowledge. As expected, Bohemond claimed the city as his own although Adhemar and Raymond disagreed. Hugh of Vermandois and Baldwin of Hainaut were sent to Constantinople, although Baldwin disappeared after an ambush on the way. Alexios, however, was uninterested in sending an expedition to claim the city this late in the summer. Back in Antioch, Bohemond argued that Alexios had deserted the crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. Bohemond and Raymond occupied Yaghi-Siyan&#x27;s palace, but Bohemond controlled most of the rest of the city and flew his standard from the citadel. It is a common assumption that the Franks of northern France, the Provencals of southern France, and the Normans of southern Italy considered themselves separate &quot;nations&quot; and that each wanted to increase its status. This may have had something to do with the disputes, but personal ambition is more likely the cause of the infighting.

Soon an epidemic broke out, possibly of typhus, and on 1 August Adhemar of le Puy died. In September the leaders of the crusade wrote to Pope Urban II, asking him to take personal control of Antioch, but he declined. For the rest of 1098, they took control of the countryside surrounding Antioch, although there were now even fewer horses than before, and Arab peasants refused to give them food. The minor knights and soldiers became restless and starvation began to set in and they threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders. In November, Raymond finally gave in to Bohemond for the sake of continuing the crusade in peace and to calm his mutinous starving troops. At the beginning of 1099 the march was renewed, leaving Bohemond behind as the first Prince of Antioch, and in the spring the siege of Jerusalem began under the leadership of Raymond.

The success at Antioch was too much for Peter Bartholomew&#x27;s skeptics. Peter&#x27;s visions were far too convenient and too martial, and he was openly accused of lying. Challenged, Peter offered to undergo ordeal by fire to prove that he was divinely guided. Being in Biblical lands, they chose a Biblical ordeal: Peter would pass through a fiery furnace and would be protected by an angel of God. The crusaders constructed a path between walls of flame; Peter would walk down the path between the flames. He did so, and was horribly burned. He died after suffering in agony for twelve days on 20 April 1099. There was no more said about the Holy Lance, although the Provencal contingent of Raymond maintained that Peter had passed safely through the flames but had been pushed back by the crowd welcoming him. Also, count Raymond kept the Lance with all reverence in his chapel.

The siege of Antioch quickly became legendary, and in the 12th century it was the subject of the &quot;chanson d&#x27;Antioche&quot; and the &quot;Siège d&#x27;Antioche&quot;, two &quot;chansons de geste&quot; in the Crusade cycle.

&quot;Count Bohemond&quot; by Alfred Duggan (1964) is a historical novel concerning the life of Bohemond and describes the siege of Antioch.

<doc id="1119251" wikidata="Q466987" url="?curid=1119251" title="Marceline Desbordes-Valmore">
<text>Marceline Desbordes-Valmore (20 June 1786 – 23 July 1859) was a French Romantic poet and novelist.

== Early life and education ==
Desbordes-Valmore was born in Douai. Following the French Revolution, her father&#x27;s business was ruined, and she traveled with her mother to Guadeloupe in search of financial help from a distant relative. Marceline&#x27;s mother died of yellow fever there, and the young girl somehow made her way back to France. At age 16, back in Douai, she began a career on stage. In 1817 she married her husband, the &quot;second-rate&quot; actor Prosper Lanchantin-Valmore.

== Career ==
Desbordes-Valmore published &quot;Élégies et Romances&quot;, her first poetic work, in 1819. In 1821 she published the narrative work &quot;Veillées des Antilles&quot;. It includes the novella &quot;Sarah&quot;, a contribution to the genre of slave stories in France.

Desbordes-Valmore appeared as an actress and singer in Douai, Rouen, the Opéra-Comique in Paris, and the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels, where she notably played Rosine in Beaumarchais&#x27;s &quot;Le Barbier de Séville&quot;. She retired from the stage in 1823. She later became friends with the novelist Honoré de Balzac, and he once wrote that she was an inspiration for the title character of &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;.

Desbordes-Valmore was a friend of the writer Louise Crombach, who introduced Desbordes-Valmore to Marie Pape-Carpantier. Their friendship ended after Crombach was prosecuted for lesbianism in 1845.

The publication of her innovative volume of elegies in 1819 marks her as one of the founders of French Romantic poetry. Her poetry is also known for taking on dark and depressing themes, which reflects her troubled life. She is the only female writer included in the famous &quot;Les Poètes maudits&quot; anthology published by Paul Verlaine in 1884. A volume of her poetry was among the books in Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s library.

<doc id="1119256" wikidata="Q7114082" url="?curid=1119256" title="Overwaitea Foods">
<text>Overwaitea Foods was a regional chain of supermarkets located in British Columbia, Canada.

On March 8, 1915, Robert C. Kidd purchased a store at 746 Columbia Street in New Westminster, British Columbia. He developed several innovative merchandising techniques to attract customers, including odd-penny pricing and selling 18 ounces of tea for the price of a pound. The store was soon known as the &quot;over-weight tea&quot; store. When Kidd opened his second store, he called it &quot;Overwaitea&quot;.

In 1968, Jim Pattison purchased Overwaitea. As of January 2007, the chain operated 15 outlets throughout the province, primarily in the smaller towns of British Columbia, while a number of stores formerly operated under the Overwaitea brand have since been converted to that of its sister chain, Save-On-Foods. Their parent company, the Overwaitea Food Group, also owns Urban Fare, PriceSmart Foods and Cooper&#x27;s Foods. All are owned by the Jim Pattison Group.

On March 22, 2018, the remaining two Overwaitea locations in British Columbia were closed, reopening the following day as Save-On-Foods stores.

<text>The carbon-dioxide laser (CO2 laser) was one of the earliest gas lasers to be developed. It was invented by Kumar Patel of Bell Labs in 1964 and is still one of the most useful types of laser. Carbon-dioxide lasers are the highest-power continuous-wave lasers that are currently available. They are also quite efficient: the ratio of output power to pump power can be as large as 20%.
The CO2 laser produces a beam of infrared light with the principal wavelength bands centering on 9.6 and 10.6 micrometers (μm).

==Amplification==
The active laser medium (laser gain/amplification medium) is a gas discharge which is air- or water-cooled, depending on the power being applied. The filling gas within a sealed discharge tube consists of around 10–20% carbon dioxide (), around 10–20% nitrogen (), a few percent hydrogen () and/or xenon (Xe), with the remainder being helium (He). A different mixture is used in a &quot;flow-through&quot; laser, where is continuously pumped through it. The specific proportions vary according to the particular laser.

The population inversion in the laser is achieved by the following sequence: electron impact excites the {v1(1)} quantum vibrational modes of nitrogen. Because nitrogen is a homonuclear molecule, it cannot lose this energy by photon emission, and its excited vibrational modes are therefore metastable and relatively long-lived. {v1(1)} and {v3(1)} being nearly perfectly resonant (total molecular energy differential is within 3 cm−1 when accounting for anharmonicity, centrifugal distortion and vibro-rotational interaction, which is more than made up for by the Maxwell speed distribution of translational-mode energy), collisionally de-excites by transferring its vibrational mode energy to the CO2 molecule, causing the carbon dioxide to excite to its {v3(1)} (asymmetric stretch) vibrational mode quantum state. The then radiatively emits at either 10.6 μm by dropping to the {v1(1)} (symmetric-stretch) vibrational mode, or 9.6 μm by dropping to the {v20(2)} (bending) vibrational mode. The carbon dioxide molecules then transition to their {v20(0)} vibrational mode ground state from {v1(1)} or {v20(2)} by collision with cold helium atoms, thus maintaining population inversion. The resulting hot helium atoms must be cooled in order to sustain the ability to produce a population inversion in the carbon dioxide molecules. In sealed lasers, this takes place as the helium atoms strike the walls of the laser discharge tube. In flow-through lasers, a continuous stream of CO2 and nitrogen is excited by the plasma discharge and the hot gas mixture is exhausted from the resonator by pumps.

The addition of helium also plays a role in the initial vibrational excitation of , due to a near-resonant dissociation reaction with metastable He(23S1). Substituting helium with other noble gases, such as neon or argon, does not lead to an enhancement of laser output.

Because the excitation energy of molecular vibrational and rotational mode quantum states are low, the photons emitted due to transition between these quantum states have comparatively lower energy, and longer wavelength, than visible and near-infrared light. The 9–12 μm wavelength of CO2 lasers is useful because it falls into an important window for atmospheric transmission (up to 80% atmospheric transmission at this wavelength), and because many natural and synthetic materials have strong characteristic absorption in this range.

The laser wavelength can be tuned by altering the isotopic ratio of the carbon and oxygen atoms comprising the molecules in the discharge tube.

==Construction==

Because CO2 lasers operate in the infrared, special materials are necessary for their construction. Typically, the mirrors are silvered, while windows and lenses are made of either germanium or zinc selenide. For high power applications, gold mirrors and zinc selenide windows and lenses are preferred. There are also diamond windows and lenses in use. Diamond windows are extremely expensive, but their high thermal conductivity and hardness make them useful in high-power applications and in dirty environments. Optical elements made of diamond can even be sand blasted without losing their optical properties. Historically, lenses and windows were made out of salt (either sodium chloride or potassium chloride). While the material was inexpensive, the lenses and windows degraded slowly with exposure to atmospheric moisture.

The most basic form of a CO2 laser consists of a gas discharge (with a mix close to that specified above) with a total reflector at one end, and an output coupler (a partially reflecting mirror) at the output end.

The CO2 laser can be constructed to have continuous wave (CW) powers between milliwatts (mW) and hundreds of kilowatts (kW). It is also very easy to actively Q-switch a CO2 laser by means of a rotating mirror or an electro-optic switch, giving rise to Q-switched peak powers of up to gigawatts (GW).

Because the laser transitions are actually on vibration-rotation bands of a linear triatomic molecule, the rotational structure of the P and R bands can be selected by a tuning element in the laser cavity. Prisms are not practical as tuning elements because most media that transmit in the mid-infrared absorb or scatter some of the light, so the frequency tuning element is almost always a diffraction grating. By rotating the diffraction grating, a particular rotational line of the vibrational transition can be selected. The finest frequency selection may also be obtained through the use of an etalon. In practice, together with isotopic substitution, this means that a continuous comb of frequencies separated by around 1 cm−1 (30 GHz) can be used that extend from 880 to 1090 cm−1. Such &quot;line-tuneable&quot; carbon-dioxide lasers are principally of interest in research applications. The laser&#x27;s output wavelength is affected by the particular isotopes contained in the carbon dioxide molecule, with heavier isotopes causing longer wavelength emission.

==Applications==
===Industrial (cutting and welding)===
Because of the high power levels available (combined with reasonable cost for the laser), CO2 lasers are frequently used in industrial applications for cutting and welding, while lower power level lasers are used for engraving. In selective laser sintering, CO2 lasers are used to fuse particles of plastic powder into parts.

===Medical (soft-tissue surgery)===
Carbon-dioxide lasers have become useful in surgical procedures because water (which makes up most biological tissue) absorbs this frequency of light very well. Some examples of medical uses are laser surgery and skin resurfacing (&quot;laser facelifts&quot;, which essentially consist of vaporizing the skin to promote collagen formation). CO2 lasers may be used to treat certain skin conditions such as hirsuties papillaris genitalis by removing bumps or podules. CO2 lasers can be used to remove vocal-fold lesions, such as vocal-fold cysts. Researchers in Israel are experimenting with using CO2 lasers to weld human tissue, as an alternative to traditional sutures.

The 10.6 μm CO2 laser remains the best surgical laser for the soft tissue where both cutting and hemostasis are achieved photo-thermally (radiantly). CO2 lasers can be used in place of a scalpel for most procedures and are even used in places a scalpel would not be used, in delicate areas where mechanical trauma could damage the surgical site. CO2 lasers are the best suited for soft-tissue procedures in human and animal specialties, as compared to laser with other wavelengths. Advantages include less bleeding, shorter surgery time, less risk of infection, and less post-op swelling. Applications include gynecology, dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and many others.

A CO2 dental laser at the 9.25–9.6 μm wavelength is sometimes used in dentistry for hard-tissue ablation. The hard-tissue is ablated at temperatures as high as 5,000 °C, producing bright thermal radiation.

===Other===
The common plastic poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) absorbs IR light in the 2.8–25 μm wavelength band, so CO2 lasers have been used in recent years for fabricating microfluidic devices from it, with channel widths of a few hundred micrometers.

Because the atmosphere is quite transparent to infrared light, CO2 lasers are also used for military rangefinding using LIDAR techniques.

CO2 lasers are used in spectroscopy and the Silex process to enrich uranium.

In semiconductor manufacturing, CO2 lasers are used for extreme ultraviolet generation.

The Soviet Polyus was designed to use a megawatt carbon-dioxide laser as an in-orbit weapon to destroy SDI satellites.

<text>David Bremner Henderson (March 14, 1840 – February 25, 1906) was an American attorney, Civil War veteran and Republican Party politician who served as the 34th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1899 to 1903. He represented Iowa in the House from 1883 to 1903. He was the first Speaker from west of the Mississippi River, the second foreign-born Speaker (after Charles Frederick Crisp), the only Speaker from Iowa, and the last Speaker who was a veteran of the Civil War.

Henderson was born in Old Deer, Scotland in 1840 and emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1846. After settling in Winnebago County, Illinois, the family relocated to Clermont in Fayette County, Iowa in 1849. He enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was wounded at the Battle of Fort Donelson and Second Battle of Corinth. After he was mustered out in 1864, Henderson started a legal practice in Dubuque, Iowa in 1865. From 1869 to 1871, he was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa.

In 1882, Henderson was elected as a Republican to represent Iowa&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. In 1889, he stood for Speaker of the House but finished behind Thomas Brackett Reed and William McKinley. From 1891 to 1895, he was the ranking Republican member of the powerful House Committee on Appropriations. When Republicans regained control of the House in the 1894 elections, Reed passed him over in favor of Joseph Gurney Cannon as committee chair, and Henderson was instead made chair of the House Committee on the Judiciary from 1895 to 1899. However, following Reed&#x27;s resignation from the House in 1899, Henderson was elected to succeed him as Speaker. In 1902, Henderson abruptly abandoned his campaign for re-election to the House, and he was succeeded by Cannon as Speaker in 1903.

==Early life==
Henderson was born in Old Deer, Scotland on March 14, 1840. He emigrated to the United States with his parents, who settled in Winnebago County, Illinois in 1846. The family moved to a farm near Clermont, in Fayette County, Iowa in 1849. He attended the common schools, and the Upper Iowa University at Fayette, Iowa.

Henderson married Augusta Fox, a fellow student at Upper Iowa University. While pursuing the same course of study they formed a lifelong attachment. After finishing their studies, their paths diverged for a time. Fox returned to her home and Henderson entered the army as a private. He was severely wounded and lost a leg, but he returned to active service and accepted a colonelcy even before fully recovering. After the close of the war Colonel Henderson and Fox were married. Fox was a native of Ohio, but had moved to Iowa at an early age. They had two daughters and one son. The elder daughter married Samuel Peaslee, and the other daughter, Isabelle, was an accomplished musician.

==Civil War service==
Henderson served in the Union Army during the Civil War and was wounded severely twice, once in the neck and later in the leg, which resulted in progressive amputations of that leg. He enlisted in the Union Army on September 15, 1861, as a private in Company C, 12th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Henderson was elected and commissioned first lieutenant of that company. In the Battle of Fort Donelson, he was shot in the neck in the final charge over the breastworks. After returning to the Regiment in April 1862, he lost one foot and part of one leg at the Second Battle of Corinth in October 1862. He was discharged on February 26, 1863, due to his wounds, and returned to Iowa. After serving as commissioner of the board of enrollment of the third district of Iowa from May 1863 to June 1864, he re-entered the Army as colonel of the new 46th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment, one of the &quot;Hundred Days Men&quot; regiments, and commanded the Regiment until it was mustered out in September 1864.

==Law practice==
Henderson was a successful lawyer prior to pursuing his political career. After studying law, he was admitted to the bar in 1865 and commenced practice in Dubuque. He was the collector of internal revenue for the third district of Iowa from November 1865 to June 1869, when he resigned to accept a position as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa, where he served until 1871. He was in private practice in Dubuque until 1882.

==Congressman and committee chair==
In 1882, Henderson was elected as a Republican to represent Iowa&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in the U.S. House, where he served from March 4, 1883, to March 3, 1903. He ran for Speaker of the House when the 51st Congress convened in 1889, finishing well behind Thomas Brackett Reed and runner-up William McKinley. He served as the chairman of the Committee on Militia in the 51st Congress, and chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary in the 54th and 55th congresses. He was also the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Appropriations during the 52nd and 53rd congresses, when the House had a Democratic majority. When Republicans regained the majority after the 1894 elections, Speaker Reed broke from tradition by returning the chairmanship to Joseph Gurney Cannon, who had served more nonconsecutive terms in the House and would have outranked Henderson had Cannon not lost his House seat for two years.

Henderson was an aggressive debater and an intense Republican partisan. He seems to have loved a fight; he got into enough of them from his very first term, exercising his power of personal vituperation and abuse against Democrats whenever he found grounds to do so. &quot;I would rather spend an eternity in hell with a Confederate than an eternity in heaven with a northern Copperhead,&quot; he told one crowd. His secret for political success came from combining mainstream Republican causes with those dear to the hearts of his farmland constituency. In the summer of 1886, he led House forces in favor of levying a high tax on oleomargarine. At the same time he sponsored a bill to raise the benefits for veterans&#x27; widows by fifty percent. (On the final passage of another bill he favored, increasing the pensions of disabled veterans, Henderson withheld his vote, since he would stand among the beneficiaries). His commitment to pension legislation, general and individual, marked his whole career and took up most of his time.

==Speaker of the House==

With the support of fellow &quot;western state&quot; Republicans, Henderson was elected to succeed Reed as Speaker following Reed&#x27;s resignation from the post in 1899. During his two terms as speaker (in the 56th and 57th congresses), Henderson, by longstanding tradition also held the role as chairman of the Committee on Rules.

On September 16, 1902—with the next Congressional election less than two months away—Henderson surprised nearly everyone by announcing that he was withdrawing from the re-election campaign. Several explanations for his abrupt withdrawal were suggested. Henderson&#x27;s letter announcing his decision referred to &quot;a growing sentiment, among Republicans, that I do not truly represent their views on the tariff question.&quot; Some attributed his decision to the lingering effects of his war injuries.

In a letter to Henderson&#x27;s successor Joe Cannon dated three days after Henderson&#x27;s announcement, former House Clerk Henry H. Smith stated that &quot;there can be but one explanation of the reason for his action [the resignation] . . . they relate not alone to poker playing, but to his alleged intimacy with a certain &#x27;lobbyess&#x27; who is reported to have some written evidence that would greatly embarrass the Speaker. . . . He seemed to have lost all control of himself and become reckless. . . . This is not mere guesswork at all but private and reliable information which I am sure you will recognize when I tell you the name.&quot; - Whatever the cause, Henderson&#x27;s resignation ushered in the beginning of Cannon&#x27;s famous tenure as Speaker.

==Death and honors==
After leaving Congress, Henderson practiced law in New York City until health problems caused him to retire to Southern California. Henderson died in Dubuque on February 25, 1906, aged 65. He is buried at Linwood Cemetery in Dubuque.

His portrait hangs in the speakers&#x27; room in the U.S. Capitol, and statues of Henderson by J. Massey Rhind are found in the collections of the Iowa State Historical Society and in Clermont.

Henderson is a namesake of Allison-Henderson Park, a city park in Dubuque, alongside six-term U.S. Senator William B. Allison, another citizen of Dubuque.

<text>Sir Amias Paulet (1532 – 26 September 1588) of Hinton St. George, Somerset, was an English diplomat, Governor of Jersey, and the gaoler for a period of Mary, Queen of Scots.

==Origins==
He was the son of Sir Hugh Paulet of Hinton St George by his wife Philippa Pollard, a daughter of Sir Lewis Pollard (c.1465 – 21 October 1526), Justice of the Common Pleas, of King&#x27;s Nympton, Devon.

==Career==
Paulet went to Jersey in 1550 when his father was made Governor and immediately acted as his assistant. The following year he was sent by his father to complain to the Privy Council that officials in Normandy were refusing to hand over six thieves who had escaped from Jersey. He was sent to Paris with a letter for the Constable of France, and thence to Normandy, returning ultimately to Jersey with his prisoners.

In 1556 he was formally appointed Lieutenant-Governor and by the end of the decade he was effectively running the island in his father&#x27;s absence. He kept this post until 1573. His father Hugh died that year, and Paulet was made Governor, a post he held until his death. There was much concern at this time about invasion by the French and Paulet went on a spying mission to the Brittany coast to discover for himself whether ships and troops were being gathered. Nothing happened because the death of the French king brought a temporary cessation to threats against the Channel Islands. However, relations with nearby Normandy were not good, as shown by a letter from Amias to his father:
Mr St Aubin has been arrested by Mons Boisrougier of Coutances, and after fourteen days imprisonment dismissed with the loss of a goshawk and 20 ells of canvas. I wrote to this Monsieur for redress, but he answered he was sorry he had dismissed his prisoner, and that his stock was not better, advising me to look to myself, as he hoped to pluck me out of my house, as he had the Captain of Alderney. If I had the Queen&#x27;s leave, I would ask no aid but the retinue of this Castle to pluck him out of his house.

Amias continued his father&#x27;s work on strengthening Mont Orgueil Castle, despite the lack of funds available from Elizabeth. He wrote in 1557:
&quot;Though I have husbanded Her Majesty&#x27;s money well I have been constrained to employ more than I received, and our walls want a third part yet&quot;.
And in 1563:
&quot;I am much deceived, considering the depth of the foundation, the height and thickness of the walls, if a greater piece of work hath ever been done for the like sum&quot;.
And again in 1573:
&quot;A strong piece of work, begun four or five years ago, lacks completion of one third. Four hundred pounds will be needed this year and four hundred next.&quot;

Like his father, Amias was strongly anti-Catholic, although more Calvinist than Protestant. When the first Huguenot refugees poured into Jersey in 1558 he appointed some of the priests among them as Rectors and ignored his father&#x27;s wishes, and to an extent those of Queen Elizabeth, over which prayer book should be used in island churches. His appointment to the Town Church of Guillaume Morise, a Huguenot minister from Anjou, led to the establishment of what Chroniques de Jersey described as the first &quot;real Reformed Church in Jersey&quot;.

There was a second influx of Huguenots in 1568 and they, too, were welcomed by Amias, although his father had reservations and wrote:
&quot;I approve my son&#x27;s zeal in receiving these strangers, but I cannot like their continued abode in the isle. They should be passed on.&quot; But father and son got on well, despite these occasional disagreements, and in 1571 Amias was made joint-Governor, becoming sole Governor on his father&#x27;s death, probably in 1578, although there are no records of the transition.

In 1576 Queen Elizabeth raised him to knighthood, appointed him Ambassador to Paris and at the same time put the young Francis Bacon under his charge. Paulet was in this embassy until he was recalled November 1579. In 1579, he took into his household, the young Jean Hotman, son of Francis Hotman, to tutor his two sons Anthony and George. When the family returned to England, the tutor and his two charges settled at Oxford.

His duties increasingly meant that Amias was absent from the island for long periods. He was appointed resident Ambassador in France for three years in 1576 and appointed Guillaume Lempriere, Seigneur of Trinity, his Lieutenant-Governor. He was clearly well trusted, because Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s principal secretary Sir Francis Walsingham wrote:
&quot;Her Majesty wishes you in matters that concern her service to deal as you think fit, though you have no special direction, such trust she reposes in you.&quot;
Paulet sent a new design of farthingale to Elizabeth I in March 1577 which was worn by Louise of Lorraine and Margaret of Valois. Paulet was present in Jersey in 1583 for the swearing-in of his son Anthony as Lieutenant-Governor and his brother George as Bailiff, before leaving to join the Privy Council.

== Paulet and Mary, Queen of Scots ==
A fanatical Puritan with a harsh character, Paulet was appointed gaoler of Mary, Queen of Scots, by Elizabeth in January 1585, at Chartley Castle, and guarded her very strictly. He replaced the more tolerant Sir Ralph Sadler and his assistant John Somers who had given Mary far more liberty. He remained her keeper until Mary&#x27;s execution at Fotheringhay Castle on 8 February 1587.

During his time with the Scottish Queen at Chartley, Paulet wrote to Francis Walsingham describing the activities of women who contributed to Mary&#x27;s secret correspondence. Paulet discovered that a gentlewoman living near the castle helped send Mary&#x27;s letters to her son James VI. The laundry women lived and worked outside the castle, and might become a security risk. Mary&#x27;s ladies in waiting could be conduits of foreign news. Letters addressed to the women of the household might attract less scrutiny. Paulet tried to recruit laundrywomen from Somerset, without local connections and so less likely to be useful to Mary&#x27;s helpers, but none would travel so far for work. Walsingham also instructed Paulet to prevent Mary&#x27;s household distributing alms or charity to houses outside the castle.

In September 1586, Paulet invited Mary to go riding in the countryside, but it was a ruse and she was taken to Fotheringhay Castle where she was made to stand trial for treason. After Mary&#x27;s conviction, Walsingham wrote to Paulet requesting he assassinate Mary, to spare Elizabeth from involvement in her death. In a letter to Walsingham, Paulet refused to &quot;make so great a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity, as shed blood without law or warrant&quot;. He was the appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter.

==Marriage and progeny==
He married Margaret Harvey, a daughter of Antony Harvey, of Columbjohn in Devon, an &quot;expert surveyor&quot;, by whom he had three sons and three daughters:
* Hugh Paulet (b. 1558), the eldest son, who predeceased his father.
* Anthony Paulet (b. 1562), eldest surviving son and heir, who also succeeded his father as Governor of Jersey. His son was John Poulett, 1st Baron Poulett (born c. 1585).
* George Paulet (b. 1565), who married his distant cousin Elizabeth Paulet, daughter and heiress of Edward Paulet of Goathurst, in Somerset
* Joan Paulet, wife of Robert Haydon (1560–1626) of Bowood, Epford and Cadhay House in Devonshire.
* Sarah Paulet, second wife of Sir Francis Vincent, 1st Baronet (c. 1568 – 1640) of Stoke d&#x27;Abernon, in Surrey. Sir Francis Vincent&#x27;s third wife was Eleanor Mallet (1573–1645), the widow and step-first cousin of Sir Arthur Acland (died 1610) of Acland in the parish of Landkey, and of Columbjohn in the parish of Broadclyst, Devon.
* Elizabeth Paulet, died unmarried.

==Death and burial==
Paulet died in London on 26 September 1588 and was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. However, his remains and monument were later removed to the Church of St George, Hinton St George, after the original church was rebuilt. His name (as &quot;Amyas le Poulet&quot;) was used by Mark Twain for a character in &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;.

<text>Frederick Huntington Gillett (; October 16, 1851 – July 31, 1935) was an American politician who served as the 42nd Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1919 to 1925 and as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1925 to 1931. A Republican, Gillett first began his career in politics when he served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1890 to 1891, and would go on to serve in the House from 1893 to 1925. In 1924, he became the oldest individual elected to a first term in the U.S. Senate, a record that he would hold until Peter Welch&#x27;s victory in the 2022 United States Senate election in Vermont 98 years later.

== Early life and education ==
Frederick H. Gillett was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, to Edward Bates Gillett (1817–1899) and Lucy Fowler Gillett (1830–1916). He graduated from Amherst College, where he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, in 1874 and Harvard Law School in 1877. He entered the practice of law in Springfield in 1877.

== Career ==

Gillett was the Assistant Attorney General of Massachusetts from 1879 to 1882. For two one-year terms he was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He was elected to the Fifty-third United States Congress in 1892.

A Republican, Gillett served in the United States House of Representatives from 1893 to 1925. On January 24, 1914, he introduced legislation to initiate the adoption of an Anti-Polygamy Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Republicans gained a net total of 24 seats in the 1918 elections, increasing the size of their majority in the House. Gillett was nominated by the Republican caucus for Speaker of the House in the upcoming 66th United States Congress. On May 19, 1919, Congress convened, and he was elected speaker, defeating the Democratic incumbent Champ Clark 228–172. Gillett was expected to exercise less control than his predecessor, since he was characterized by one reporter as someone who did not drink coffee in the morning &quot;for fear it would keep him awake all day&quot;. He was reelected as speaker in 1921 and again in 1923.

In 1923, votes cast by the Progressive wing of the GOP resulted in multiple ballots as no Speaker candidate gained a majority. On the ninth ballot, after the Republican leadership agreed to Progressive procedural reforms, Gillet was eventually elected. This was the only time in the 20th century that the House failed to elect a Speaker during the first roll call, and the 14th time in history that election of the Speaker required multiple ballots. The previous occurrence was in 1859 for the 36th Congress, which elected William Pennington after 44 ballots. The next occurrence was a century later in 2023 for the 118th Congress, which elected Kevin McCarthy after 15 ballots.

Gillett decided to run for the United States Senate in 1924. He won the Republican primary easily over two other candidates and then narrowly defeated incumbent Senator David I. Walsh in the Republican landslide of November 1924 led by President Calvin Coolidge, a former governor of Massachusetts. He was at the time the oldest person ever elected to a first term in the Senate, a record that would stand for 98 years. &quot;Time&quot; magazine chose him for its November 17, 1924 cover. He served one term in the Senate from 1925 to 1931, and decided not to seek re-election in the face of a difficult primary challenge. In June 1930, he declined to state his position on prohibition or its repeal when queried by prohibition advocates.

== Personal life ==
On November 25, 1915, Gillett married Christine Rice Hoar, the widow of his former colleague in Congress, Rockwood Hoar. In 1934, he published a biography of George Frisbie Hoar, an earlier congressman and senator from Massachusetts, and his wife&#x27;s father-in-law from her previous marriage.

During his time in Washington, Gillett spent his free time driving his 1926 Pontiac Coupe and playing golf in the morning. In retirement, he wintered in Pasadena, California. He died in a hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts, on July 31, 1935. Gillett was buried at Pine Hill Cemetery in Westfield.

<doc id="1119334" wikidata="Q584560" url="?curid=1119334" title="Dysgraphia">
<text>Dysgraphia is a neurological disorder and learning disability that concerns impairments in written expression, which affects the ability to write, primarily handwriting, but also coherence. It is a specific learning disability (SLD) as well as a transcription disability, meaning that it is a writing disorder associated with impaired handwriting, orthographic coding and finger sequencing (the movement of muscles required to write). It often overlaps with other learning disabilities and neurodevelopmental disorders such as speech impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or developmental coordination disorder (DCD).

In the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (&quot;DSM-5&quot;), dysgraphia is characterized as a neurodevelopmental disorder under the umbrella category of specific learning disorder. Dysgraphia is when one&#x27;s writing skills are below those expected given a person&#x27;s age measured through intelligence and age-appropriate education. The DSM is unclear in whether writing refers only to the motor skills involved in writing, or if it also includes orthographic skills and spelling.

Dysgraphia should be distinguished from agraphia (sometimes called acquired dysgraphia), which is an acquired &quot;loss&quot; of the ability to write resulting from brain injury, progressive illness, or a stroke.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;dysgraphia&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;dys&quot; meaning &quot;impaired&quot; and γραφία &quot;graphía&quot; meaning &quot;writing by hand&quot;.

==Development==
There are at least two stages in the act of writing: the linguistic stage and the motor-expressive-praxic stage. The linguistic stage involves the encoding of auditory and visual information into symbols for letters and written words. This is mediated through the angular gyrus, which provides the linguistic rules which guide writing. The motor stage is where the expression of written words or graphemes is articulated. This stage is mediated by Exner&#x27;s writing area of the frontal lobe.

The condition can cause individuals to struggle with feedback and anticipating and exercising control over rhythm and timing throughout the writing process.

People with dysgraphia often write on some level and may experience difficulty with other activities requiring reciprocal movement of their fingers and other fine motor skills, such as; tying shoes, fastening buttons or playing certain musical instruments. However, dysgraphia does not affect all fine motor skills. People with dysgraphia often have unusual difficulty with handwriting and spelling, which in turn can cause writing fatigue. Unlike people without transcription disabilities, they tend to fail to preserve the size and shape of the letters they produce if they cannot look at what they are writing. They may lack basic grammar and spelling skills (for example, having difficulties with the letters p, q, b, and d), and often will write the wrong word when trying to formulate their thoughts on paper. The disorder generally emerges when the child is first introduced to writing. There is accumulating evidence that, in many cases, individuals with SLDs and DCD do not outgrow their disorders. Accordingly, it has been found that adults, teenagers, and children alike are all subject to dysgraphia. Studies have shown that higher education students with developmental dysgraphia still experience significant difficulty with hand writing, fine motor skills and motor-related daily functions when compared to their peers without neurodevelopmental disorders.

==Classification==
Dysgraphia is nearly always accompanied by other learning disabilities and/or neurodevelopmental disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or oral and written language learning disability &quot;(OWL LD)&quot; and this can impact the type of dysgraphia a person has. Tourette syndrome, ASD and dyspraxia are also common diagnoses among dysgraphic individuals. Developmental dysgraphia was originally described as being a disorder that occurs solely in dyslexic individuals. Dysgraphia was not studied as a separate entity until mid-20th century when researchers discovered there were different types that occur without dyslexia. Dyslexics and dysgraphics experience similar synchronization difficulties and issues with spelling. However, dyslexia does not seem to impair physical writing ability or dramatically impact fine motor skills and dysgraphia does not impact reading comprehension. Methods for evaluating, managing and remedying dysgraphia are still evolving, but there are three principal subtypes of dysgraphia that are recognized.

===Dyslexic===
There are several features that distinguish dyslexic-dysgraphia (sometimes called &quot;linguistic dysgraphia&quot;) from the other types. People with dyslexic-dysgraphia typically have poor oral and written spelling that is typically phonemic in nature. Their spontaneously written work is often illegible, has extra or deleted syllables or letters, and contains unnecessary capitalization or large spaces in the middle of words which can make each individual word unrecognizable. They may also insert symbols that do not resemble any letter of the alphabet. Writing production generally requires long periods of contemplation and correction.

Dyslexic-dysgraphic individuals have fairly good copied work, and their ability to draw is also preserved. Their finger tapping speed (a method for identifying fine motor problems) is normal, indicating that the deficit does not likely stem from cerebellar damage. Impaired verbal executive functioning has also been related to this form of the disorder.

One study found that boys with ADHD and dysgraphia struggle primarily with motor planning rather than have a linguistic impairment but the prevalence of linguistic/dyslexic-dysgraphia compared to other subtypes is uncertain.

===Motor===

Motor dysgraphia (sometimes called &quot;peripheral dysgraphia&quot;) is due to deficient fine motor skills, poor dexterity, poor muscle tone or unspecified motor clumsiness. Motor dysgraphia impairs both motor patterns and motor memory. Letter formation may be acceptable in very short samples of writing, but this requires extreme effort and an unreasonable amount of time to accomplish, and it cannot be sustained for a significant length of time, as it can cause arthritis-like tensing of the hand. Overall, their written work is poor to illegible even if copied by sight from another document, and drawing is impaired. Oral spelling for these individuals is normal, and their finger tapping speed is below normal. This shows that there are problems within the fine motor skills of these individuals. People with developmental coordination disorder may be dysgraphic and motor-dysgraphia may serve as a marker of dyspraxia. Motor-dysgraphics struggle with proper finger grip and writing is often slanted due to holding a pen or pencil incorrectly. Average writing speed is slower than that of non-dysgrapic individuals, but this seems to improve with age. Motor skill deficits appears to be a common cause of dysgraphia; a study using digital tablets to measure various components of dysgraphic children&#x27;s writing found that 78% of children with the disorder present kinematic difficulties, while 58% of them display issues with exerting pressure.

===Spatial===
A person with spatial dysgraphia has an impairment in the understanding of space. This impaired spatial perception causes illegible spontaneously written work, illegible copied work, abnormal spacing between letters and majorly impaired drawing abilities. They have normal oral spelling and normal finger tapping speed, suggesting that this subtype is not fine motor based. 

===Miscellaneous===
Other subtypes and informal classification systems have been proposed by researchers; this includes but is not limited to phonological dysgraphia, deep dysgraphia and surface dysgraphia.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms to dysgraphia are often overlooked or attributed to the student being lazy, unmotivated, careless or anxious. The condition may also be dismissed as simply being an expression of attention deficiency or having delayed visual-motor processing. In order to be diagnosed with dysgraphia, one must have a cluster, but not necessarily all, of the following symptoms:

The symptoms of dysgraphia can change as one ages. Dysgraphia may cause students distress often due to the fact that no one can read their writing, and they are aware that they are not performing to the same level as their peers. Emotional problems that may occur alongside dysgraphia include impaired self-esteem, lowered self-efficacy, reduced motivation, poorer social functioning, heightened anxiety, and depression. They may put in extra efforts in order to have the same achievements as their peers, but often get frustrated because they feel that their hard work does not pay off. Dysgraphia is a hard disorder to detect as it does not affect specific ages, gender, or intelligence. The main concern in trying to detect dysgraphia is that people hide their disability behind their verbal fluency/comprehension and strong syntax coding as a means to mask the handwriting impairments caused by the disorder. Having dysgraphia is not related to a lack of cognitive ability, and it is not uncommon in intellectually gifted individuals, but due to dysgraphia their intellectual abilities are often not identified.

===Associated conditions===

There are some common problems not related to dysgraphia but often associated with dysgraphia, the most common of which is stress. Developing an aversion to writing is another common issue. Often children &quot;(and adults)&quot; with dysgraphia will become extremely frustrated with the task of writing specially on plain paper (and spelling); younger children may cry, pout, or refuse to complete written assignments. This frustration can cause the individuals a great deal of stress and can lead to stress-related illnesses. This can be a result of any symptom of dysgraphia.

==Causes==

The underlying causes of the disorder are not fully understood, but dysgraphia is known to have genetic causes. More specifically, it is a working memory problem caused by specific neurodevelopmental dysfunction. In dysgraphia, individuals fail to develop normal connections among different brain regions needed for writing. People with dysgraphia have difficulty in automatically remembering and mastering the sequence of motor movements required to write letters or numbers. Dysgraphia is also in part due to underlying problems in orthographic coding, the orthographic loop, and graphomotor output (the movements that result in writing) by one&#x27;s hands, fingers and executive functions involved in letter writing. The orthographic loop is when written words are stored in the mind&#x27;s eye, connected through sequential finger movement for motor output through the hand with feedback from the eye.

Family history of specific learning disabilities may play a role. Children with developmental dysphasia, developmental dysgraphia and developmental dyslexia may be more likely to have family members with one of these conditions. Genetic studies suggest that verbal executive function tasks, orthographic skills, and spelling ability may have a genetic basis. Genes on chromosomes 6 and 15 may play some role with SLDs as they have linked to poorer reading, poorer spelling and lower phonemic awareness.

== Diagnosis ==
Unlike specific learning disabilities and neurodevelopmental disorders that have been more extensively studied, there is no gold standard for diagnosing dysgraphia. This is likely due to writing systems often differing substantially between countries and languages and there being considerable heterogeneity among medical professionals who are charged with diagnosing dysgraphia. Consequently, there are several tests that are used to diagnose dysgraphia like Ajuriaguerra scale, BHK for children or teenagers, the Minnesota Handwriting Assessment, ETCH, SCRIPT, DASH and HHE scale.

With devices like drawing tablets, it is now possible to measure the position, tilt, and pressure in real time. From these features, it is possible to compute automatic features like speed and shaking and train a classifier to diagnose automatically children with atypical writing. The features extracted have different importances in the classification through development and allow to characterize different subtypes of dysgraphia that could have different origins, outcomes and could require different remediation strategies.

It is not uncommon for dysgraphic individuals to be intellectually gifted, possess a rich vocabulary and have strong comprehension of language when speaking or reading, though their disorder is often not detected or treated; which may also be in part to developmental dyslexia receiving far more academic and medical attention than developmental dysgraphia. In addition, gifted children with transcription disabilities seldom receive programming for their intellectual talents due to their difficulties in completing written assignments.

==Treatment==
Treatment for dysgraphia varies and may include treatment for motor disorders to help control writing movements. Helping dysgraphic students overcome writing avoidance and accept the purpose and necessity of writing may be needed. The use of occupational therapy can be effective in the school setting, and teachers should be well informed about dysgraphia to aid in carry-over of the occupational therapist&#x27;s interventions. One common form of therapy is the use of Thera-putty, which helps develop dexterity. Treatments may address impaired memory or other neurological problems. Some physicians recommend that individuals with dysgraphia use computers to avoid the problems of handwriting. Speech-to-text programs have also been suggested as a potential treatments for dysgraphia. Speech-recognition technologies are used in two ways: dictation and computer control. As a dictation tool, spoken words are translated into written text; the student speaks the words into a microphone and the words are typed. The computer-control tool allows students to control the computer and software applications by speaking commands. If students are going to use speech-recognition software, they need to use consistent, clear speech. The use of computers also allows patients to experiment with different ergonomic keyboards. Today, there are many alternative keyboards for consideration. There are keyboards with enlarged and/or alphabetically arranged letters; there are key boards that are ergonomically designed; and there are mini keyboards for students who have a limited range of motion. Dysgraphia can sometimes be partially overcome with appropriate and conscious effort and training.

== Prevalence ==
It has been estimated that up to 10% of children in the world are affected by disabilities like dysgraphia, dyslexia, dyscalculia and dyspraxia. 

==School==

There is no special education category for students with dysgraphia; in the United States, The National Center for Learning Disabilities suggests that children with dysgraphia be handled in a case-by-case manner with an Individualized Education Program, or provided individual accommodation to provide alternative ways of submitting work and modify tasks to avoid the area of weakness. (It can often be difficult for students to have general accommodations for any student that might have dysgraphia as &quot;Careful planning should precede all technology purchases, as many technologies are costly and school budgets are limited. In considering adoption of any of the technology recommended&quot;) Students with dysgraphia often cannot complete written assignments that are legible, appropriate in length and content, or within given time. It is suggested that students with dysgraphia receive specialized instructions that are appropriate for them. Children will mostly benefit from explicit and comprehensive instructions, help translating across multiple levels of language, and review and revision of assignments or writing methods. Direct, explicit instruction on letter formation and guided practice will help students achieve automatic handwriting performance before they use letters to write words, phrases, and sentences. Some older children may benefit from the use of a personal computer or a laptop in class so that they do not have to deal with the frustration of falling behind their peers. Predictive text technology has been suggested as something that could greatly help students with dysgraphia.
It is also suggested by Berninger that teachers with dysgraphic students decide if their focus will be on manuscript writing (printing) or keyboarding. In either case, it is beneficial that students are taught how to read cursive writing as it is used daily in classrooms by some teachers. It may also be beneficial for the teacher to come up with other methods of assessing a child&#x27;s knowledge other than written tests; an example would be oral testing. This causes less frustration for the child as they are able to get their knowledge across to the teacher without worrying about how to write their thoughts. Dysgraphic students may benefit from special accommodation by their teachers when being required to write. Accommodations that may be helpful include but are not limited to; offering larger pencils or pencils with special grips, supplying paper with raised lines to provide tactile feedback, allowing extra time for classwork assignments, scaling down large written assignments and breaking down long written assignments into multiple shorter assignments.

The number of students with dysgraphia may increase from 4 percent of students in primary grades, due to the overall difficulty of handwriting, and up to 20 percent in middle school because written compositions become more complex. With this in mind, there are no exact numbers of how many individuals have dysgraphia due to its difficulty to diagnose and exact prevalence depends on the definition of dysgraphia. There are slight gender differences in association with written disabilities; overall it is found that males are more likely to be impaired with handwriting, composing, spelling, and orthographic abilities than females.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) does not use the term dysgraphia but uses the phrase &quot;an impairment in written expression&quot; under the category of &quot;specific learning disorder&quot;. This is the term used by most doctors and psychologists. To qualify for special education services, a child must have an issue named or described in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). While IDEA does not use the term &quot;dysgraphia&quot;, it describes it under the category of &quot;specific learning disability&quot;. This includes issues with understanding or using language (spoken or written) that make it difficult to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell or to do mathematical calculations.

<text>The Mitsubishi Lancer is an automobile that was produced by the Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors from 1973 until 2024.

The Lancer has been marketed as the Colt Lancer, [[Dodge Colt]], [[Plymouth Colt]], Chrysler Valiant Lancer, Chrysler Lancer, [[Eagle Summit]], Hindustan Lancer, Soueast Lioncel, and [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] in various countries at different times, and has been sold as the Mitsubishi Galant Fortis in Japan since 2007. It has also been sold as Mitsubishi Lancer Fortis in Taiwan with a different facelift than the Galant Fortis. In Japan, it was sold at a specific retail chain called Car Plaza.

Between its introduction in 1973 and 2008, over six million units were sold. There have been ten generations of Lancers.

Mitsubishi ended production of the Lancer in August 2017 worldwide, with the exception of Taiwan. An extensive facelift was given to the car by Pininfarina&#x27;s Chinese offices. Production in Taiwan ended in 2024, marking the end of the Lancer nameplate after 51 years.


== First generation (A70; 1973) ==


The first Lancer (A70) was launched in February 1973. It served to fill the gap between the Minica kei car and the larger Galant. The sporting 1600 GSR model began the Lancer&#x27;s long and successful rally history, winning the Safari Rally twice and the Southern Cross Rally four times.

There were four body styles, two- and four-door sedans, a two-door hardtop coupe and a long-running five-door station wagon (built until replaced by the front-wheel drive Lancer/Mirage Van in March 1984). Engines were different 1.2-liter, 1.4-liter, and 1.6-liter fours.

This car was marketed under a variety of names: Dodge Colt in the United States, Plymouth Colt in Canada, Dodge Lancer in some Latin American countries, Chrysler Valiant Lancer in Australia, and Colt Lancer in some European markets.

=== Celeste ===
In February 1975, the Lancer was complemented by a hatchback called the Lancer Celeste, succeeding the Galant FTO. It was also called the Mitsubishi Celeste (New Zealand) or Colt Celeste in some markets; and sold as the Chrysler Lancer in Australia, the Dodge Lancer Celeste in El Salvador, the Plymouth Arrow in the United States, and the Dodge Arrow in Canada.

Four-door Lancer assembly began in New Zealand in 1975, supplementing the larger English Hillman Avengers also built locally by importer Todd Motors. The Celeste was imported built-up from Japan initially and assembly of a single 1.6- liter, manual transmission model began in 1978 followed by a minor facelift about a year later.

The Celeste was originally available with 1.4- and 1.6-liter options, while a bigger 2.0-liter model was added later. An even larger 2.6-liter four was available in the US-market Plymouth Fire Arrow. The Celeste was facelifted in 1978, receiving square headlights and bigger squarer bumpers. Production of the Lancer Celeste ended in July 1981 and it was replaced by the front-wheel drive Cordia in early 1982.
== Second generation (EX/A170; 1979) ==

In 1979, the Lancer EX was presented in Japan. Its revised styling with integrated plastic bumpers reflected that of the recently introduced Galant and Sapporo.

This generation is only available as 4-door sedan, while the previous generation Celeste coupé and wagon/van were continued for a few more years. More spacious, it grew in all dimensions. Only two engines were offered at first, a 1.4-litre MCA-Jet equipped engine paired with Mitsubishi&#x27;s Silent Shaft Technology, which generated and a 1.6-litre engine that generated . The MCA-Jet system was an entirely new concept when compared with the previously used carburetor system. The MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air which meant that the EX passed both Japan and US emission standards, while the new cylinder head design of the engine gave way for a Jet valve which introduced an extra swirl of air to the combustion chamber, swirling the fuel-air mixture for a cleaner, efficient and more thorough burn.

Another innovation in the Lancer lineup was marketed as &quot;Silent Shaft Technology,&quot; consisting of two counterbalancing shafts that rotated in opposite directions, cancelling the power pulses inherent in an inline four-cylinder engine. This reduced both engine noise and vibration, and provided a smoother driving experience. The 1.8-litre Sirius 80 engines were then introduced in the Lancer in 1980, expanding the Lancer&#x27;s range of engines. Also, a turbocharged, engine was added in 1980 for sportier performance, and an intercooler system was also integrated in the existing turbocharged engine to produce in 1983.

In 1980, The Lancer EX was introduced with a 1.8-litre turbocharged inline-four option known as the 1800GSR and GT Turbo. The first generation 1800GSR and GT were only available with a turbocharged, non-intercooled .

New Zealand importer Todd Motors assembled the new Lancer EX from 1980 with 1.6-liter carburetor gasoline engine and a choice of manual or automatic transmission. The model was also a popular base for rally cars in that market, with some success. It was replaced by the front-drive Tredia in 1982 with the Cordia coupé equivalent effectively replacing the earlier Celeste.

This generation was manufactured locally in Indonesia by Mitsubishi&#x27;s partner, PT. Krama Yudha Kesuma Motor at their plant in Jakarta. Unique for this market, this generation was fitted with a 1.4-litre (1439 cc) 4G33 engine, inherited from the previous generation Lancer (never offered in the country) and possibly the only market that received this engine in this generation. It was only offered with a single trim called SL.

=== Europe ===

In Europe, the Lancer EX sold well as its restrained styling better matched the desires of European buyers than its somewhat fussy predecessor. Other considerations concerned handling and also the demand for more passenger room, as Mitsubishi tailored the Lancer towards European consumers. It went on sale locally after making its European premier at the 1979 Frankfurt Show.

Unlike in Japan at the time of introduction, European buyers could get a 1.2-litre option which suited local tax conditions. This engine later did become available in Japan as well, beginning in May 1981, but was discontinued in 1983 after the introduction of the smaller Lancer Fiore. Claimed outputs in Europe were lower than in the domestic market because of the net rating, with the 1200, 1400, and 1600 being good for respectively. Here, the Lancer EX was also offered with a turbocharged 2.0-litre SOHC engine, known as the Lancer EX2000 Turbo. It achieved a maximum output of and managed a top speed of . This model was equipped with Electronically Controlled Injection (ECI).

A rally version of the Lancer 2000 Turbo was made and homologated for Group 4 and Group B, made out . At home, sales of the turbo model were low because of emission regulations Japan imposed at that time.

=== Japan ===
While exports were generally halted in 1983, this generation continued to be available alongside the Mirage-based, front-wheel drive Lancer Fiore until 1987 in Japan.

== Third to seventh generations (1982–2003: Mirage-based Lancers) ==
Between 1982 and 2003, the Lancer in Japan derived from the subcompact Mirage—itself sold in many export markets under the name Colt. Mitsubishi had originally launched the Mirage in 1978 as a front-wheel drive hatchback, with a sedan variant later released in 1982—and a version of which sold in Japan as &quot;Lancer Fiore&quot;. Five generations of Mirage were manufactured by Mitsubishi up until 2003, with new generations released in 1983 and 1987 (with the equivalent Lancer delayed until 1988), 1991 to 1995. It was not until 1988—with the 1979 to 1987 Lancer now departed—that the Mirage-based Lancer eschewed the Fiore suffix in the home market.

Between 1982 and 1987, the aforementioned Mirage sedan with minor styling modifications sold as the Lancer Fiore through Japanese retail channels. The Fiore spanned two generations, the second of which came to the market in 1983. Internationally, the Fiore sedan often sold under the abbreviated name Lancer, and sometimes as the &quot;Lancer F&quot; (for example, in Germany). Thus, with the rear-wheel drive Lancer as introduced in 1979 and the front-wheel drive Lancer Fiore, Mitsubishi had two similarly sized models competing in the same market segment, sometimes even while sharing the Lancer badge.

Although naming conventions varied, for all generations, sedan versions of the Mirage were typically badged as Lancer in export markets such as the Philippines, although notably not in the United States. In Japan, sedan variants of the Mirage and Lancer sold alongside one another with minor differences in trim. The station wagon, part of the 1983 and 1991 iterations, was typically known as the Lancer in export markets. Likewise, the Mirage coupe variant, available with the 1991 and 1995 generations, also became part of the Lancer lineup in some regions. The 1983 generation also spawned a licence built derivative in the form of the Malaysian built Proton Saga.

Mitsubishi introduced replacements for the Mirage starting in 2000, with a new generation of Lancer sedan—now larger and having moved up to the compact segment. Then in 2002, a subcompact five-door hatchback badged Colt internationally became available, thus substituting the Mirage hatchback. By 2003, the Mirage had been completely phased out of mainstream Japanese production and Lancer became the primary title for Mitsubishi&#x27;s compact offerings.

=== Timeline ===
== Eighth generation (2000) ==

May 2000 saw the release in Japan of the Lancer Cedia (meaning CEntury DIAmond), though in most markets the previous 1995 vintage Mirage-based Lancer soldiered on for a while longer, production continuing at Mitsubishi&#x27;s Mizushima plant in Japan. The new model was available in sedan and station wagon forms. In Europe, the Lancer was not offered in some countries, being too close to the size of the Dutch-built Mitsubishi Carisma, so the Evolution VII model sold there bore the Carisma name. This series of Lancer was still sold in Japan for 3 years alongside the 2007 onwards generation Lancer, sold there as the &quot;Galant Fortis&quot;.

In February 2003, for the 2004 model year, a heavily restyled Lancer surfaced with a front styling that brought it into line with the Mitsubishi corporate look, as well as a restyled rear, to further differentiate itself from the Lancer Evolution. The car&#x27;s grille was then redesigned again in 2005 for the 2006 model year.

=== Marketing ===
==== Asia ====
In Japan, the Lancer Cedia was offered with many different trim levels and engines, including some options never exported, such as a cargo variant of the station wagon, which was replaced by a rebranded Nissan AD. It was also one of the first models to use the INVECS-III CVT transmission. There was also a Ralliart version of the Sportswagon which was powered by a turbocharged 1.8-liter GDI engine. Until 2010, it was still sold alongside the 9th generation, known in Japan as the Galant Fortis.

In Taiwan, the Mitsubishi Lancer was produced and marketed by China Motor Corporation, and the car was slightly restyled in the beginning with larger front grilles, extra chrome trims, and the rear license plate located on the trunk lid instead of the rear bumper. Later, following the internationally sold facelift version, the front lamps were restyled and reshaped to be triangular while the tail lamps extended onto the trunk lid which is different from the version sold in other parts of the world. An additional facelift was added again in 2005 with white marker lights in the front replacing the amber ones and restyled tail lamps.

In Indonesia, the Lancer was available in GLXi and SEi trims. It was assembled locally and sold from 2002 until 2012.

In Malaysia, the Lancer was made available after Mitsubishi had sold all its shares in Malaysian carmaker Proton, marking the return of Mitsubishi in the Malaysian market after being absent since 1985 due to the agreement with Proton. The Lancer sold in Malaysia was powered by the &quot;4G18&quot; engine which also powered the early 1.6-liter Proton Waja model.

In the Philippines, the Lancer Cedia was originally launched in 2003, sourced from Mitsubishi&#x27;s Thailand plant until 2008, with 2008 to 2012 models assembled in Mitsubishi&#x27;s production plant in Cainta, Rizal. Initially offered with 3 trim levels; the GLX, GLS and MX. Both GLX and GLS were powered with a 1.6-litre &quot;4G18&quot; SOHC engine with 110 PS (81 kW). The MX was powered with a 1.8-litre &quot;4G93&quot; SOHC engine. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual (GLX and GLS) or &quot;INVECS-III&quot; CVT (GLS and MX). The refreshed Lancer was introduced between 2005 and 2007 with same 3 trim levels. During 2007, Mitsubishi Philippines also marketed the GT and GSR trims. Both were powered with a 2.0-litre &quot;4G63&quot; engine, mated with a 4-speed &quot;INVECS-II&quot; transmissions. The only differences between that GT received semi-bucket seats and a Momo steering wheel, while the GSR had leather seats and only came in Glaire Beige (champagne). At the same time, the lower trim GL was added into the lineup. Initially offered with a manual transmission and a 1.6-litre engine. In 2008, it got also the third facelift; featuring front grille, front bumper, 7-spoke alloy wheel design, revised taillights and black smoked headlights. It was only offered in 2 trim levels; the GLX with a manual transmission and GLS with an &quot;INVECS-III&quot; CVT transmission. Both were powered with a 1.6-litre &quot;4G18&quot; engines.

In Pakistan, this variant was launched in 2005 with cosmetic changes from the front and the back. Thai production was switched to the new model, and in all markets except for India the previous model was no longer marketed, four years after the Cedia&#x27;s introduction. In India, it was first introduced at the 2006 Auto Expo in New Delhi as the Lancer Cedia, complementing the lower-priced Lancer. All Lancer variants were built by Mitsubishi&#x27;s Indian partner Hindustan Motors. From 2009 on, it was sold under the Cedia name alone, available as the Cedia Select and the Cedia Sports. In order to comply with the emissions regulations and to accommodate lower quality petrol, it used a slightly detuned version of the SOHC 16-valve 4G94 found on the Lancer, having at 5250 rpm and at 4250 rpm. The Cedia, a rather expensive car for Indian conditions, was discontinued without a direct successor in June 2013 as Mitsubishi India chose to focus on SUVs. Production was reported to have ended in November 2012.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, this series of Lancer was introduced as the CG series in July 2002 with the 2.0-liter &quot;4G94&quot; engine. The 2003 facelift, designated the CH series, introduced a heavily updated VR-X, which included new 16&quot; alloys, stiffer suspension, body styling kit, and gear shifter borrowed from the Lancer Evolution. In 2004, the new Lancer wagon was introduced as a direct replacement for its ageing circa 1992 predecessor.

In August 2005, all Lancers were upgraded to the 2.4-liter &quot;4G69&quot; engine, producing and of torque. The upgraded engine also saw a change in trim levels and upgraded equipment—the ES and LS models now featured a more upmarket looking black interior, while the VR-X gained a new black grille to closer resemble the Lancer Evolution IX. The equipment levels of all models were also upgraded, with the LS and VR-X gaining climate control, and a premium audio system sourced from the luxury Mitsubishi Verada. The Exceed model was discontinued, and all updated models now used JDM sized rear bumpers instead of the larger USDM sized versions. Additionally, the wagon also saw these changes; and as of 2007, continues to be sold alongside the sedan.

The ES and LS models were given a minor facelift for the 2007 model year; this time gaining the same front grille as the US models, and putting it into line with the current corporate look—similar to that of the Colt and the locally built 380. A limited edition ES model dubbed &quot;Velocity&quot; went on sale prior to this generation being replaced. This package included VR-X grille, rear spoiler, leather/Alcantara bolstered seats, sports pedals, 15-inch alloy wheels and chrome exhaust tip—all for the same price as the previous standard ES.

==== Europe ====
In some European markets, the Lancer began to take the place of the Carisma in 2004. It is powered by a 1.3-liter SOHC 16-valve &quot;4G13&quot; engine producing at 5,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. The next engine in the range is the 1.6-liter SOHC &quot;4G18&quot; engine producing at 5,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm. Finally, there is the 2.0-liter DOHC &quot;4G63&quot; producing at 5,750 rpm and at 4,500 rpm.

==== North America ====
In North America, the Lancer was introduced in 2001 for the 2002 model year as a direct replacement for the Mirage. In the United States, Chrysler had offered an unrelated Dodge Lancer at various stages between the 1950s and 1980s. However, when Daimler, who owned Chrysler at the time, briefly controlled Mitsubishi through the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi alliance from 2000 through to 2004, the rights to the &quot;Lancer&quot; name were relinquished to Mitsubishi for usage in North America. Consequently, after Mitsubishi discontinued the 1995 series Mirage for North America in 2001, the replacement model adopted the Lancer name for the first time. This also allowed Mitsubishi to save themselves the licensing fees to use the &quot;Mirage&quot; name from Grand Touring Cars, Inc., who had the rights to the name for the Mirage race car series.

North American Lancers were powered by a 2.0-liter &quot;4G94&quot; engine producing and of torque. In Mexico, the Lancer sedan was available in DE, ES, LS and GS trims with a 2.0-liter DOHC 4G63 engine.


In addition to the facelift, North America received three additional models to the Lancer line in 2004—Lancer Ralliart, LS Sportback and Ralliart Sportback. Ralliart slots in between the base models and high-performance Evolution. These cars came equipped with Mitsubishi&#x27;s 2.4-liter &quot;4G69&quot; engine (rated at / for the Sportback, and / for the Ralliart). The power gain was due to a tuned muffler for the Ralliart, and also included a new, stiffer suspension package that improved handling and lowered for Ralliart and lifted the LS Sportback by 2.9 inches. The LS Sportback had 15-inch steel or optional 15-inch alloy wheels. The Ralliart came with 16-inch alloy wheels, front bucket seats borrowed from Japan&#x27;s Mitsubishi Evolution GT-A, optional fog lamps, and a new aerodynamic ground package for Ralliart. The LS Sportback and Ralliart Sportback were equipped with a four-speed INVECS-II automatic transmission, while the Ralliart came with a five-speed manual transmission with an option for the four-speed automatic.

For the 2006 model year, the fascia was changed again from a bridged fascia to one with an open vent after Mitsubishi received complaints from current owners regarding its similarity in appearance to General Motors Division Pontiac&#x27;s corporate look, and to bring the appearance closer to its bigger brother, the Evolution.

The Lancer Sportback wagon was cancelled in the United States one year after its release, but the Mitsubishi Lancer wagon was sold in Canada for a while longer.
== Ninth generation (2007) ==


In 2005, Mitsubishi revealed the &quot;Concept X&quot; model car at the Tokyo Motor Show and its &quot;Concept Sportback&quot; model at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The new Lancer was previewed by these two concepts. The new Lancer was officially revealed in January 2007 at the North American International Auto Show and went on sale in North American markets in March 2007 as a 2008 model. New Lancer features Mitsubishi&#x27;s next-generation &quot;RISE&quot; safety body.

==== Asia ====
With the exception of the Lancer Evolution X, the Lancer is marketed as the Galant Fortis (Latin for strong, brave and resolute) in the Japanese domestic market because the sixth generation of Lancer is still in production at that time. It comes in three trim levels: Exceed, Super Exceed, and Sport.

Due to the popular demand for the previous 2000-era Lancer in Singapore, it continued to be sold alongside the new 2007 era Lancer which was called &quot;Lancer EX&quot; to differentiate itself from the former for two years. The 1.5- and 2.0-liter engine sizes and a flagship GT trim level were available in Singapore. For model year 2009, the design was refreshed all around with an updated front grille, darkened clear tail lamps, and chrome lining with an additional floor console internally. The rear for the 2.0-liter variants had disc brakes for better stopping power. From 2014 models onwards, only a 1.6-liter engine was offered in Elegance and Sports trim with factory AM/FM radio, ducktail spoiler, and 16&quot; black gloss 10-spoke chrome rims or 16&quot; Spaco gunmetal rims. For a limited period between 2015 and 2017, the Lancer EX had a slightly revamped rear with double rectangular “C-shaped” LED tail lamp clusters and had its Lancer badge positioned to the center of the boot.

In Malaysia, the Lancer was first launched in August 2007 with a sole variant known as GT. The Lancer was then updated in 2009 and an EX variant was launched in July 2010. In October 2010, the Sportback bodystyle was launched in October 2010. The Lancer was then updated in August 2012 and April 2014. Also, Proton had renewed cross-licensing and technology transfer agreements with Mitsubishi as of October 2008 and lead to the Proton Inspira which is a badge-engineered 2007–2017 Lancer.

In Indonesia, only the GT is sold and it utilizes the 2.0-liter &quot;4B1&quot; engine and is sold alongside the Evolution X. The previous generation Lancer was still sold, marketed as the Cedia using the 1.8-liter &quot;4G9&quot; engine.

Hong Kong received its unique edition of the Lancer in 2008, dubbed the Lancer 2.0. The car comes in two trim levels, without a name for either of them. Both are equipped with the &quot;4B11&quot; 2.0-liter engine, seven airbags, eight-speaker stereo system, adaptive front-lighting system (AFS) with HID as well as 18-inch alloy wheels. The upper trim has a Ralliart style body kit which includes a revised front bumper, side skirt, rear bumper with diffuser, and the addition of a correct-to-Evolution X rear spoiler, while the lower trim makes do without the above-mentioned features.

In the Philippines, the 9th generation Lancer was launched in mid-2008 as the &quot;Lancer EX&quot; to differentiate it from the previous generation Lancer sold alongside it, which would be discontinued in 2012. It is only offered with a 2.0-litre &quot;4B11&quot; powerplant, and trims were the top-of-the-line GT and GT-A. The GT and GT-A were essentially the same, both coming with rear spoilers, side skirts, and 18-inch alloy wheels. The only differences between that GT came with a 5-speed manual, which was discontinued in 2010, while the GT-A came with an &quot;INVECS-III&quot; CVT with paddle shifters. A Ralliart version was took place in 2010, with a 2.0-litre single turbo engine, making 240 hp, paired to a 6-speed &quot;dual-clutch&quot; transmission. Like the Evolution X, it came with an all-wheel-drive system featuring active yaw control and an active center differential. In 2011, 3 trim levels were offered as the previous generation; the base GLX with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed &quot;INVECS-II&quot; transmission, the mid-range GLS, which was discontinued in 2012 and higher-spec MX were both equipped with a 4-speed &quot;INVECS-II&quot; transmissions and all powered with a 1.6-litre &quot;4A92&quot; MIVEC engines. The refreshed Lancer EX was took place in 2016 with 2 trim levels are available; the GLS with a 1.6-litre &quot;4A92&quot; MIVEC engine, mated with a 5-speed manual transmission and GT-A also with a 2.0-litre &quot;4B11&quot; engine, equipped with an electronic sunroof and mated with an &quot;INVECS-III&quot; CVT transmission.

Between August 2015 and August 2017, GHK Motors (Mitsubishi Brunei) had offered a version of the Lancer Sportback under the name Mitsubishi Galant in Brunei. The Galant is equipped with the 2.4-liter engine, 18-inch alloy wheels, a Ralliart style front grille, side skirts, rear spoiler, and sports front seats.

==== Australia ====
The Lancer was released in Australia in October 2007, designated the CJ series, and was initially available in ES, VR and VRX trim. The ES included cruise control, driver, passenger, and knee airbags, stability and traction control as standard. The VR added alloy wheels, fog lights, side skirts, boot lip spoiler, rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, six-disc CD changer, as well as curtain and side airbags. The VRX received extra skirts including front aprons, a larger rear spoiler, 18-inch alloys, 9-speaker Rockford Fosgate sound system, keyless entry, keyless engine start, and Bluetooth connectivity with voice control. All three models shared the same 4B11 2.0-litre engine and can be found with a manual gearbox or CVT. The Sportback body followed the sedan and has been available for all variants except the Aspire.

In July 2008, the Lancer Evolution X (officially just &quot;Lancer Evolution&quot; at the time) became available for orders in Australia.

In September 2008, another variant, the Aspire, was introduced. The Aspire was based on the 2009 model VRX, which had a new 4B12 2.4-litre engine. The Aspire included more luxury features and only came with a CVT, whereas the VRX maintained a manual gearbox option.

In late 2008, the Ralliart variant became available. It featured a single turbocharged version of the 4B11 engine, all-wheel drive (AWD) and a twin-clutch six-speed (TC-SST) gearbox.

In 2010, the limited edition ACTiV was added to the lineup. The ACTiV was based on the ES and added features such as 16-inch alloy wheels, side skirts, rear spoiler, hands-free Bluetooth and multi-function leather steering wheel.

Various special models have also been introduced, such as the Platinum Edition, which is based on the VR but added a chrome grille, window surrounds (sedan only), MMCS satellite navigation, and Bluetooth. The RX version is derived from the ES but comes with standard alloy wheels. Another model introduced in 2010 was the SX coming with factory alloys, leather steering wheel, and gear shifter as well as factory spoiler.

From the 2013 model year onward (introduced in late 2012), the Aspire was dropped.

==== Europe ====
In Europe, a diesel model was also available from 2007 to September 2010. This was a 2.0-liter PD-TDI engine sourced from Volkswagen, with engine code BWC. From September 2010, it was also available with Mitsubishi&#x27;s own 1.8-liter &quot;4N1&quot; engine. This engine has an aluminium cylinder block, four valves per cylinder and a common rail injection system with variable geometry turbocharger and variable valve timing. It develops and .

In Ireland, the specifications are different from those of models sold in the United Kingdom. The Lancer is available in five-door hatchback (Sportback) or four-door sedan body styles. Engines are the 1.5- and 1.8-liter petrol and the 2.0-liter diesel—all available in the United Kingdom until 2012. Trim levels are GS2, GS3, and GS4 for the saloon, and GS2, GS3, and Juro (satellite navigation and rear-view camera) for the Sportback. The Sportback Juro model marked a temporary end to the line in the UK and was the most generously equipped. A Ralliart version (petrol), a detuned version of the Evolution, was also available. Mitsubishi intended to supply the UK with 400 further Lancers in late 2014.

==== North America ====
For the United States, the Lancer was initially available in DE, ES, and GTS trim levels. DE, ES, and GTS models are powered by a GEMA based &quot;4B11&quot;, 2.0-liter DOHC engine producing (except for California models which have been detuned to to meet regulations). Transmission options include a brand new &quot;F1CJA&quot; continuously variable transmission (CVT), sourced from Jatco, alongside a regular &quot;F5MBB&quot; five-speed manual sourced from Aisin Seiki. GTS models get a six-speed paddle shift version of the CVT.

In Canada, a fourth model (SE) was introduced to the Lancer lineup. The SE model is a cross between the ES and GTS models. Features not included in the SE model that is found in the GTS are the FAST key, automatic climate control, carbon-fiber trim pieces, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and 18-inch wheels.

For US markets, starting with the 2009 model year, an ES Sport version was released similar to the SE model for the Canadian market. Externally the ES Sport is similar in appearance to the GTS—with side skirts, rear spoiler, etc. (with the exception of the wheels, the ES Sport retains the ES wheelset). The ES Sport also uses the 2.0-liter engine.

For 2009, the GTS is powered by a 2.4-liter &quot;4B12&quot; engine producing and .

For 2012, A new trim level called SE was added. The SE model features the 2.4-liter &quot;4B12&quot; engine and Mitsubishi&#x27;s all-wheel-drive system. The SE is only available with a CVT transmission. For 2013, another trim level called GT was added. Based on the all-wheel-drive SE trim level, excluding the all-wheel control system, the GT features sportier suspension, upmarket options, and an available manual transmission.

The five-door hatchback version, known as the &quot;Sportback&quot;, was introduced for the Canadian market in spring 2009, and in the US for the 2010 model year in mid-2009.

A detuned and cheaper version of the Evolution X was announced at the 2008 North American International Auto Show. This model became available for purchase in the United States in October 2008.

For 2009, the Ralliart is available exclusively with the TC-SST transmission. The TC-SST transmission equipped in the Ralliart offers two modes (Normal, Sport) rather than the three modes the same transmission offers in the Lancer Evolution X MR (Normal, Sport, S-Sport). The car also includes a simplified version of the Evolution X&#x27;s AWD system, with a simple &quot;mechanical limited-slip&quot; rear differential.

==== South America ====
To differentiate it from the previous model, still, on sale, this model is marketed as &quot;Lancer Serie R&quot; in Chile. For the same reason, in El Salvador, depending on the engine and trim, this series is titled &quot;Lancer EX&quot; or &quot;Lancer GT&quot;.

In Brazil, Lancer was officially sold by Mitsubishi Motors 2007–2019. Between 2015 and 2019 was produced in Catalão Mitsubishi&#x27;s factory. It was sold in four versions: MT, HL, HLE, and GT. All versions come with the 2.0-liter &quot;4B11&quot; I4 engine (gasoline). The Lancer Sportback was sold until 2013 in a single version, signed by Ralliart, and the Lancer Evolution X is also sold, although not produced locally.

=== Facelift ===

In October 2015, Mitsubishi released details of the model year 2016 Lancer facelift for North America. The MY16 update was announced and released for Australia in December 2015. It sports a mildly altered front and does without the Ralliart-style grille of the MY15 version, now with a cleaner front bumper with integrated chrome upper and lower grilles. New C-shaped LED daytime running lamps surrounding the foglights and side skirts complete the exterior changes, while the cabin gains a high-contrast instrument cluster, a new front centre console with silver and black accents, and a new colour touchscreen audio system with DAB digital radio. It was also released in the Philippines in April 2016 and it came in two trims; GLS and GT-A.

=== Discontinuation ===
Mitsubishi Motors North America&#x27;s executive vice president and CEO, Don Swearingen, confirmed in January 2017 that Mitsubishi would end the Lancer&#x27;s production in August 2017 (production in Brazil continue until 2019), without a successor. Mitsubishi&#x27;s main focus was to be on crossovers and SUVs, but production of the Mirage hatchback and the G4 sedan will continue due to ongoing popular demand for the Mirage nameplate in the North American market.

=== Lancer Fortis / Lancer iO ===
The Lancer Fortis and Lancer iO are derivatives of the global Lancer model. Both models were developed primarily for the Taiwanese market, historically a stronghold for Mitsubishi vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancer Fortis 08/2007 news.u-car.com.tw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Lancer Fortis and iO are locally assembled in Taiwan and China by CMC and Soueast respectively. CMC also exported the Lancer Fortis to the Middle East.

The Lancer Fortis made its debut in Taiwan in August 2007. The Fortis has a unique exterior design, but its interior styling and mechanical underpinnings are largely identical to the global Lancer model. Early models of the Lancer Fortis were powered by the , 2.0-litre &quot;4B11&quot; engine paired to the INVECS-III CVT gearbox.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancer Fortis 08/2007 autonet.com.tw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later variants were offered with the , 1.8-litre &quot;4B10&quot; plant, while the 2.0-litre Fortis models were discontinued by 2010.

In April 2008, Mitsubishi launched the Lancer iO in Taiwan. The iO was pitched as a sportier version of the Lancer Fortis, featuring a more aggressive front grille and bumper combination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancer iO 06/2008 feature.u-car.com.tw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Mitsubishi discontinued the Fortis-based iO, and launched the global Lancer locally under the iO nameplate. The Taiwanese colloquial term for the 2012 Lancer iO and the global Lancer is &#x27;shark head&#x27; (鯊魚頭).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancer iO 04/2012 carstuff.com.tw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lancer Fortis made its Chinese debut at the 2013 Shanghai Motor Show. The Chinese market Lancer Fortis features a different front grille and bumper design in addition to other minor cosmetic changes. The base models are powered by the , 1.6-litre &quot;4A92&quot; engine, and the range topping variants received the 1.8-litre &quot;4B10&quot;. The Lancer Fortis in China is positioned in between the more expensive Lancer EX, and the cheaper Lancer Classic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand Lancer 07/2016 carnewschina.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taiwanese market Lancer Fortis and iO were simultaneously facelifted in May 2014. The design of the front grille and bumper combination on both models became more aggressive, while the Fortis adopted the &#x27;shark head&#x27; design and the headlamps from the global Lancer. The rear lamps on both models were also revised, and the interior designs received minor cosmetic enhancements. The powerplant configuration for both models was refined for better fuel efficiency but was otherwise largely unchanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancer Fortis/iO 05/2014 news.u-car.com.tw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese market Lancer EX was later updated in line with the Lancer iO design.


==Tenth generation (2017) ==

In January 2017, Mitsubishi Motors agreed to continue the Lancer nameplate in certain Asian markets such as Taiwan after 2017, due to ongoing popular demand for the Lancer nameplate within the Chinese-speaking world. The development of the new Grand Lancer in Taiwan was led and designed by the Taiwanese China Motor Corporation (CMC). Part of the design was partnered with Pininfarina Shanghai. Due to the international version being discontinued, the new generation Lancer is built on the same platform as the existing model as an extensive facelift. It comes with the new Mitsubishi Dynamic Shield grille and redesigned creases over the side body panels. The interior, front hood, front bumpers, front fenders, front and rear door panels including the rear passenger door window, the boot lid, and the rear bumper have been completely redesigned for the new generation, while the rest is carried over from the pre-2017 model.

===Discontinuation===
On 1 April 2024, CMC confirmed the Grand Lancer had ended production, marking the end of the nameplate after 51 years.

== Sales ==
=== Australia ===
Since 2007, the Lancer has regularly featured within the Top 10 and Top 20 vehicle sales charts. Prior to the discontinuation of Lancer production in 2017, John Signoriello, CEO of Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd, decided to stockpile as many Lancers as possible, in order to sell them in succeeding years. The following table shows sales since 2006.

<text>Purple Butterfly () is a 2003 Chinese film, directed by Lou Ye. It is Lou&#x27;s third film after &quot;Weekend Lover&quot; and &quot;Suzhou River&quot;. It stars Chinese mainland actors, Zhang Ziyi, Liu Ye and Li Bingbing, as well as Japanese actor Tōru Nakamura. The film premiered on May 23, 2003, at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, and was given a limited release in New York City the following year on November 26, 2004.

Cynthia (Zhang Ziyi) and a Japanese student, Itami (Tôru Nakamura), have fallen in love in Japanese controlled Manchukuo prior to the war when Itami is forced to return to Japan.

Years later, in Shanghai, Szeto (Liu Ye) and Tang Yiling (Li Bingbing) have fallen in love. Cynthia has also returned to Shanghai now as a member of Purple Butterfly, a powerful resistance group against the Japanese occupation, led by Xie Ming (Feng Yuanzheng). After a case of mistaken identity and a shootout at a railroad station that leaves Yiling dead, Szeto finds himself an unexpected pawn in the battle between former lovers Cynthia and Itami who has also come to Shanghai, now as a member of the Japanese secret police unit tasked with dismantling Purple Butterfly.

== Reception ==
With the success of Lou&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Suzhou River&quot; (2000), &quot;Purple Butterfly&quot; was an anticipated follow up with a considerably larger budget. The film received polarizing receptions. Rotten Tomatoes records a 45% &quot;rotten&quot; rating. Metacritic records the film received a 68 score out of 100, meaning &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

G. Allen Johnson of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; describes the film as &quot;a gorgeously shot, ambitious epic&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film, &quot;a remarkable period piece, evoking the bustling, dense and increasingly dangerous Shanghai of the &#x27;30s&quot;. Thomas praised Zhang as an actress with &quot;formidable resources&quot; and &quot;has that crucial gift of holding herself in check at just the right moments for maximum dramatic impact and psychological complexity&quot;. Thomas further state the film is &quot;suspenseful, atmospheric and sometimes puzzling&quot;.
However, other critics saw the film as technically masterful but a case where style had trumped substance. In particular the film&#x27;s labyrinthine and difficult to follow plot was pointed to as a major point of complaint. One such review by Sean Axmaker of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; called the film &quot;lush but confusing&quot;, and states &quot;&quot;Purple Butterfly&quot; is rich with emotional turmoil and searing beauty, but it could have used a little more time in the editing room to make sense of it all.&quot;

<doc id="1119342" wikidata="Q976837" url="?curid=1119342" title="Dynamic nuclear polarization">
<text>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is one of several hyperpolarization methods developed to enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. While an essential analytical tool with applications in several fields, NMR’s low sensitivity poses major limitations to analyzing samples with low concentrations and limited masses and volumes. This low sensitivity is due to the relatively low nuclear gyromagnetic ratios (&quot;γn&quot;) of NMR active nuclei (1H, 13C, 15N, etc.) as well as the low natural abundance of certain nuclei. Several techniques have been developed to address this limitation, including hardware adjustments to NMR instruments and equipment (e.g., NMR tubes), improvements to data processing methods, and polarization transfer methods to NMR active nuclei in a sample—under which DNP falls.

Overhauser et al. were the first to hypothesize and describe the DNP effect in 1953; later that year, Carver and Slichter observed the effect in experiments using metallic lithium. DNP involves transferring the polarization of electron spins to neighboring nuclear spins using microwave irradiation at or near electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) transitions. It is based on two fundamental concepts: first, that the electronic gyromagnetic moment (&quot;γe&quot;) is several orders of magnitude larger than &quot;γn&quot; (about 658 times more; see below), and second, that the relaxation of electron spins is much faster than nuclear spins.

formula_1,

where

formula_2

is the Boltzmann equilibrium spin polarization. Note that the alignment of electron spins at a given magnetic field and temperature is described by the Boltzmann distribution under thermal equilibrium. A larger gyromagnetic moment corresponds to a larger Boltzmann distribution of populations in spin states; through DNP, the larger population distribution in the electronic spin reservoir is transferred to the neighboring nuclear spin reservoir, leading to stronger NMR signal intensities. The larger γ and faster relaxation of electron spins also help shorten T1 relaxation times of nearby nuclei, corresponding to stronger signal intensities.

Under ideal conditions (full saturation of electron spins and dipolar coupling without leakage to nuclear spins), the NMR signal enhancement for protons can at most be 659. This corresponds to a time-saving factor of 434,000 for a solution-phase NMR experiment. In general, the DNP enhancement parameter η is defined as:

formula_3

where I is the signal intensity of the nuclear spins when the electron spins are saturated and I0 is the signal intensity of the nuclear spins when the electron spins are in equilibrium.

DNP methods typically fall under one of two categories: continuous wave DNP (CW-DNP) and pulsed DNP. As their names suggest, these methods differ in whether the sample is continuously irradiated or pulsed with microwaves. When electron spin polarization deviates from its thermal equilibrium value, polarization transfers between electrons and nuclei can occur spontaneously through electron-nuclear cross relaxation or spin-state mixing among electrons and nuclei. For example, polarization transfer is spontaneous after a homolysis chemical reaction. On the other hand, when the electron spin system is in a thermal equilibrium, the polarization transfer requires continuous microwave irradiation at a frequency close to the corresponding EPR frequency. It is also possible that electrons are aligned to a higher degree of order by other preparations of electron spin order such as chemical reactions (known as chemical-induced DNP or CIDNP), optical pumping, and spin injection. A polarizing agent (PA)—either an endogenous or exogenous paramagnetic system to the sample—is required as part of the DNP experimental setup. Typically, PAs are stable free radicals that are dissolved in solution or doped in solids; they provide a source of unpaired electrons that can be polarized by microwave radiation near the EPR transitions. DNP can also be induced using unpaired electrons produced by radiation damage in solids. Some common PAs are shown.

Described below are the four different mechanisms by which the DNP effect operates: the Overhauser effect (OE), the solid effect (SE), the cross effect (CE), and thermal mixing (TM). The DNP effect is present in solids and liquids and has been utilized successfully in solid-state and solution-phase NMR experiments. For solution-phase NMR experiments, only the OE mechanism is relevant, whereas for solid-state NMR any of the four mechanisms can be employed depending on the specific experimental conditions utilized.

The first DNP experiments were performed in the early 1950s at low magnetic fields but until recently the technique was of limited applicability for high-frequency, high-field NMR spectroscopy because of the lack of microwave (or terahertz) sources operating at the appropriate frequency. Today, such sources are available as turn-key instruments, making DNP a valuable and indispensable method especially in the field of structure determination by high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

==Mechanisms==

===Overhauser effect===
DNP was first realized using the concept of the Overhauser effect, which is the perturbation of nuclear spin level populations observed in metals and free radicals when electron spin transitions are saturated by microwave irradiation. This effect relies on stochastic interactions between an electron and a nucleus. The &quot;dynamic&quot; initially meant to highlight the time-dependent and random interactions in this polarization transfer process.

The DNP phenomenon was theoretically predicted by Albert Overhauser in 1953 
and initially drew some criticism from Norman Ramsey, Felix Bloch, and other renowned physicists of the time on the grounds of being &quot;thermodynamically improbable&quot;. The experimental confirmation by Carver and Slichter as well as an apologetic letter from Ramsey both reached Overhauser in the same year.

The so-called electron-nucleus cross-relaxation, which is responsible for the DNP phenomenon is caused by rotational and translational modulation of the electron-nucleus hyperfine coupling. The theory of this process is based essentially on the second-order time-dependent perturbation theory solution of the von Neumann equation for the spin density matrix.

While the Overhauser effect relies on time-dependent electron-nuclear interactions, the remaining polarizing mechanisms rely on time-independent electron-nuclear and electron-electron interactions.

===Solid effect===
The simplest spin system exhibiting the SE DNP mechanism is an electron-nucleus spin pair. The Hamiltonian of the system can be written as:

:formula_4

These terms are referring respectively to the electron and nucleus Zeeman interaction with the external magnetic field, and the hyperfine interaction. S and I are the electron and nuclear spin operators in the Zeeman basis (spin {{frac|1|2}} considered for simplicity), &quot;ωe&quot; and &quot;ω&quot;n are the electron and nuclear Larmor frequencies, and &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are the secular and pseudo-secular parts of the hyperfine interaction. For simplicity we will only consider the case of |&quot;A&quot;|,|&quot;B&quot;|«|&quot;ω&quot;n|. In such a case &quot;A&quot; has little effect on the evolution of the spin system. During DNP a MW irradiation is applied at a frequency &quot;ω&quot;MW and intensity &quot;ω&quot;1, resulting in a rotating frame Hamiltonian given by
:formula_5where formula_6

The MW irradiation can excite the electron single quantum transitions (&quot;allowed transitions&quot;) when &quot;ω&quot;MW is close to &quot;ω&quot;e, resulting in a loss of the electron polarization. In addition, due to the small state mixing caused by the B term of the hyperfine interaction, it is possible to irradiate on the electron-nucleus zero quantum or double quantum (&quot;forbidden&quot;) transitions around &quot;ω&quot;MW = &quot;ω&quot;e ± &quot;ω&quot;n, resulting in polarization transfer between the electrons and the nuclei. The effective MW irradiation on these transitions is approximately given by &quot;Bω&quot;1/2&quot;ω&quot;n.

====Static sample case====
In a simple picture of an electron-nucleus two-spin system, the solid effect occurs when a transition involving an electron-nucleus mutual flip (called zero quantum or double quantum) is excited by a microwave irradiation, in the presence of relaxation. This kind of transition is in general weakly allowed, meaning that the transition moment for the above microwave excitation results from a second-order effect of the electron-nuclear interactions and thus requires stronger microwave power to be significant, and its intensity is decreased by an increase of the external magnetic field B0. As a result, the DNP enhancement from the solid effect scales as B0−2 when all the relaxation parameters are kept constant. Once this transition is excited and the relaxation is acting, the magnetization is spread over the &quot;bulk&quot; nuclei (the major part of the detected nuclei in an NMR experiment) via the nuclear dipole network.
This polarizing mechanism is optimal when the exciting microwave frequency shifts up or down by the nuclear Larmor frequency from the electron Larmor frequency in the discussed two-spin system. The direction of frequency shifts corresponds to the sign of DNP enhancements.
Solid effect exist in most cases but is more easily observed if the linewidth of the EPR spectrum of involved unpaired electrons is smaller than the nuclear Larmor frequency of the corresponding nuclei.

====Magic angle spinning case====
In the case of magic angle spinning DNP (MAS-DNP), the mechanism is different but to understand it, a two spins system can still be used. The polarization process of the nucleus still occurs when the microwave irradiation excites the double quantum or zero quantum transition, but due to the fact that the sample is spinning, this condition is only met for a short time at each rotor cycle (which makes it periodical). The DNP process in that case happens step by step and not continuously as in the static case.

===Cross effect===

====Static case====
The cross effect requires two unpaired electrons as the source of high polarization. Without special condition, such a three spins system can only generate a solid effect type of polarization. However, when the resonance frequency of each electron is separated by the nuclear Larmor frequency, and when the two electrons are dipolar coupled, another mechanism occurs: the cross-effect. In that case, the DNP process is the result of irradiation of an allowed transition (called single quantum) as a result the strength of microwave irradiation is less demanded than that in the solid effect. In practice, the correct EPR frequency separation is accomplished through random orientation of paramagnetic species with g-anisotropy. Since the &quot;frequency&quot; distance between the two electrons should be equal to the Larmor frequency of the targeted nucleus, cross-effect can only occur if the inhomogeneously broadened EPR lineshape has a linewidth broader than the nuclear Larmor frequency. Therefore, as this linewidth is proportional to external magnetic field B0, the overall DNP efficiency (or the enhancement of nuclear polarization) scales as B0−1. This remains true as long as the relaxation times remain constant. Usually going to higher field leads to longer nuclear relaxation times and this may partially compensate for the line broadening reduction.
In practice, in a glassy sample, the probability of having two dipolarly coupled electrons separated by the Larmor frequency is very scarce. Nonetheless, this mechanism is so efficient that it can be experimentally observed alone or in addition to the solid-effect.

====Magic angle spinning case====
As in the static case, the MAS-DNP mechanism of cross effect is deeply modified due to the time dependent energy level. By taking a simple three spin system, it has been demonstrated that the cross-effect mechanism is different in the Static and MAS case. The cross effect is the result of very fast multi-step process involving EPR single quantum transition, electron dipolar anti-crossing and cross effect degeneracy conditions.
In the most simple case the MAS-DNP mechanism can be explained by the combination of a single quantum transition followed by the cross-effect degeneracy condition, or by the electron-dipolar anti-crossing followed by the cross-effect degeneracy condition.

This in turn change dramatically the CE dependence over the static magnetic field which does not scale like B0−1 and makes it much more efficient than the solid effect.

===Thermal mixing===
Thermal mixing is an energy exchange phenomenon between the electron spin ensemble and the nuclear spin, which can be thought of as using multiple electron spins to provide hyper-nuclear polarization. Note that the electron spin ensemble acts as a whole because of stronger inter-electron interactions. The strong interactions lead to a homogeneously broadened EPR lineshape of the involved paramagnetic species. The linewidth is optimized for polarization transfer from electrons to nuclei, when it is close to the nuclear Larmor frequency. The optimization is related to an embedded three-spin (electron-electron-nucleus) process that mutually flips the coupled three spins under the energy conservation (mainly) of the Zeeman interactions. Due to the inhomogeneous component of the associated EPR lineshape, the DNP enhancement by this mechanism also scales as B0−1.

===DNP-NMR enhancement curves===

Many types of solid materials can exhibit more than one mechanism for DNP. Some examples are carbonaceous materials such bituminous coal and charcoal (wood or cellulose heated at high temperatures above their decomposition point which leaves a residual solid char). To separate out the mechanisms of DNP and to characterize the electron-nuclear interactions occurring in such solids a DNP enhancement curve can be made. A typical enhancement curve is obtained by measuring the maximum intensity of the NMR FID of the 1H nuclei, for example, in the presence of continuous microwave irradiation as a function of the microwave frequency offset.

Carbonaceous materials such as cellulose char contain large numbers of stable free electrons delocalized in large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Such electrons can give large polarization enhancements to nearby protons via proton-proton spin-diffusion if they are not so close together that the electron-nuclear dipolar interaction does not broaden the proton resonance beyond detection. For small isolated clusters, the free electrons are fixed and give rise to solid-state enhancements (SS). The maximal proton solid-state enhancement is observed at microwave offsets of ω ≈ ωe ± ωH, where ωe and ωH are the electron and nuclear Larmor frequencies, respectively. For larger and more densely concentrated aromatic clusters, the free electrons can undergo rapid electron exchange interactions. These electrons give rise to an Overhauser enhancement centered at a microwave offset of ωe – ωH = 0. The cellulose char also exhibits electrons undergoing thermal mixing effects (TM). While the enhancement curve reveals the types electron-nuclear spin interactions in a material, it is not quantitative and the relative abundance of the different types of nuclei cannot be determined directly from the curve.

===DNP-NMR===
DNP can be performed to enhance NMR signals but also to introduce an inherent spatial dependence: the magnetization enhancement takes place in the vicinity of the irradiated electrons and propagates throughout the sample. Spatial selectivity can finally be obtained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, so that signals from similar parts can be separated based on their location in the sample.
DNP has triggered enthusiasm in the NMR community because it can enhance sensitivity in solid-state NMR. In DNP, a large electronic spin polarization is transferred onto the nuclear spins of interest using a microwave source. There are two main DNP approaches for solids. If the material does not contain suitable unpaired electrons, exogenous DNP is applied: the material is impregnated by a solution containing a specific radical. When possible, endogenous DNP is performed using the electrons in transition metal ions (metal-ion dynamic nuclear polarization, MIDNP) or conduction electrons. The experiments usually need to be performed at low temperatures with magic angle spinning. It is important to note that DNP was only performed ex situ as it usually requires low temperature to lower electronic relaxation.

<text>The 1967 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1967 season. The 64th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. In a rematch of the 1946 World Series, the Cardinals won in seven games for their second championship in four years and their eighth overall. The Series was played from October 4 to 12 at Fenway Park and Busch Memorial Stadium. It was the first World Series since 1948 that did not feature the Yankees, Dodgers, or Giants.

==Background==
This was the sixth meeting between teams from Boston and St. Louis for a major professional sports championship.

===Boston Red Sox===

The &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; Red Sox were led by triple crown winner Carl Yastrzemski (who won the Most Valuable Player award for his 1967 performance) and ace pitcher Jim Lonborg, who won the American League Cy Young Award. The Red Sox reached the World Series by emerging victorious from a dramatic four-team pennant race that revitalized interest in the team after eight straight losing seasons. Going into the last week of the season, the Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox were all within one game of each other in the standings. The White Sox lost their last five games (two to the lowly Kansas City Athletics and three to the similarly inept Washington Senators) to fall out of the race. Meanwhile, the Red Sox and Twins met in Boston for the final two games of the season, with Minnesota—who won the AL Pennant two years earlier—holding a one-game lead. Boston swept the Twins, but needed to wait out the result of the Tigers&#x27; doubleheader with the California Angels in Detroit. A Detroit sweep would have enabled them to tie the Red Sox for first place. The Tigers won the first game but the Angels won the nightcap, enabling the Red Sox to claim their first pennant since 1946.

===St. Louis Cardinals===

The Cardinals won 101 games en route to the National League pennant, with a team featuring All-Stars Orlando Cepeda (selected as the National League Most Valuable Player), Lou Brock, Tim McCarver, and 1964 World Series MVP Bob Gibson, as well as former two-time American League MVP Roger Maris and Curt Flood. Twenty-two-year-old Steve Carlton won 14 games in his first full major league season, beginning what was to be a lengthy and very successful career. The Cardinals overcame the absence of Bob Gibson, who missed almost one-third of the season with a broken leg on July 15 (on disabled list, July 16 – September 6) suffered when he was struck by a ball hit by Pittsburgh&#x27;s Roberto Clemente. Gibson still managed to win 13 games, and while he was out, Nelson Briles filled his spot in the rotation brilliantly, winning nine consecutive games as the Cardinals led the N.L. comfortably for most of the season, eventually winning by games over the San Francisco Giants.

==Summary==
Pitching dominated this World Series, with Bob Gibson leading the Cardinals. Lonborg pitched the decisive final game of the regular season for Boston, so he was unable to start Game 1. Facing José Santiago, Gibson and St. Louis won the Series opener, 2–1. Maris (obtained from the New York Yankees in December 1966) knocked in both of St. Louis&#x27; runs with third and seventh-inning grounders. Santiago pitched brilliantly and homered in the third inning off Gibson for the Red Sox&#x27; only run.

Gibson cemented his reputation as an unhittable postseason pitcher in this series, allowing only three total runs over three complete games. His efforts allowed the Cardinals to triumph despite the hitting of Yastrzemski (.500 OBP, .840 SLG), and pitching of Lonborg, who allowed only one run total in his complete-game wins in Games 2 and 5. In Game 2, Yastrzemski belted two homers but the story was Lonborg. The Boston ace retired the first 19 Cardinals he faced until he walked Curt Flood with one out in the seventh inning. He had a no-hitter until Julián Javier doubled down the left field line with two out in the eighth. Lonborg settled for a one-hit shutout in which he faced only 29 batters.

In St. Louis, the El Birdos (as Cepeda had nicknamed them) took Games 3 and 4, with Briles pitching the home team to a 5–2 victory (a two-run homer by Mike Shannon proved to be the decisive factor), and Gibson tossing a 6–0 whitewashing (with two RBIs apiece by Maris and McCarver). With the Cardinals leading 3 games to 1, Lonborg kept the Bosox in the series with a 3–1 victory in Game 5. The 25-year-old righthander tossed two-hit shutout ball over innings, then finally gave up a run when Maris homered to right.
Going for the clincher at Fenway Park in Game 6, the visiting team took a 2–1 lead going into the fourth inning when Dick Hughes (who led the National League with a .727 winning percentage and won 16 games during the regular season) gave up a record three homers in a single inning. Yastrzemski led off the inning with a long drive over the wall in left center and, two outs later, rookie Reggie Smith and Rico Petrocelli hammered consecutive shots. Brock tied the game with a two-run homer in the seventh, but Boston responded with four runs of their own in the bottom of that inning and went on for the 8–4 triumph to tie the series at three games all. The Cardinals set a World Series record using eight pitchers.

The decisive Game 7 featured Gibson and Lonborg facing each other for the first time in the series, but Lonborg was starting on only two days&#x27; rest and was unable to compete with Gibson, who allowed only three hits over the course of a complete game. Going into Game 7, both pitchers were 2–0 in the series with Gibson giving up four hits in 18 innings and Lonborg surrendering a single run and four hits in his 18. Something had to give—and it was Lonborg. The Cardinal ace clearly dominated the finale, allowing only three hits, striking out 10 batters and even adding a home run blast of his own in the fifth. Javier added a three-run shot off Lonborg in the sixth and Gibson cruised to the decisive 7–2 victory. He now boasted a 5–1 record and a 2.00 ERA in two World Series, with 57 strikeouts in 54 innings and only 37 hits allowed.

==Matchups==

===Game 1===

In attendance for the opening match-up were Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy, both Massachusetts natives and supporters of the Red Sox.

Ace Bob Gibson (13–7, 2.98), who sat out July and August with a broken leg, started Game 1 for the Cardinals while 21-year-old José Santiago (12–4, 3.59) started for the Red Sox. Santiago, starting because Sox ace Jim Lonborg had pitched the final day of the regular season, won seven straight second-half games helping Boston stave off the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins to win the pennant by one game in a tightly fought race.

Pitching was prime as Gibson and Santiago seemed to have their best stuff for this afternoon game at Fenway. The Cards got on the board in the top of the third on a leadoff single to center by Lou Brock, a double by Curt Flood, and a Roger Maris groundout to first scoring Brock from third. The Sox came right back to tie the score in the bottom of the same inning. After Bob Gibson struck out Red Sox catcher Russ Gibson, Santiago helped his own cause by homering to left center field.

However, Bob Gibson was masterful the rest of the way finishing with ten strikeouts, allowing just six hits with one walk. Santiago matched Gibson until the top of the seventh when Brock again led off with a single to right (his fourth hit), promptly stole second base, and eventually scored on back-to-back groundouts by Flood and Maris. That run would hold up for a 2–1 Cardinal win, but Lonborg was waiting in the wings to start Game 2.

===Game 2===

Jim Lonborg enjoyed his best season as a professional in 1967 capturing the Cy Young Award with an A.L. best 22 wins (against nine losses), was tops with 246 strikeouts, and had an impressive earned run average of 3.16. Lonborg continued his superb pitching starting Game 2 for the Red Sox and for innings, the Cardinals could only manage one baserunner, a seventh inning walk by Curt Flood. After Tim McCarver and Mike Shannon led off the eighth with groundouts, Julián Javier turned a Lonborg fastball around, lining a double into the left-field corner breaking up his no-hitter. Bobby Tolan, pinch-hitting for weak-hitting Dal Maxvill, ended the inning by grounding out to second-base. Lonborg retired the side in order in the ninth ending the game as close to perfect, giving up just one hit and one walk while striking out four.

Carl Yastrzemski provided more than enough offense by homering in the fourth and adding a three-run shot in the seventh (scoring Jose Tartabull and Dalton Jones.) The other Red Sox run came in the sixth inning on walks to George Scott and Reggie Smith and a sacrifice-fly by shortstop Rico Petrocelli. The final score was 5–0 to even up the series at one game apiece with an upcoming journey to St. Louis for Game 3.

===Game 3===

After &quot;Sleepwalking in Boston&quot;, the St. Louis Cardinals came out of their hitting slumber and tagged Boston starter Gary Bell for three runs on five hits in the first two innings of Game 3. A former 16-game winner for the Cleveland Indians, Bell was an early-season pickup who pitched well in 29 games for the Sox going 12–8 with an ERA of 3.16. But he didn&#x27;t have his best stuff against the Cardinals&#x27; starter, 23-year-old Nelson Briles. Briles, after losing 15 games in 1966, alternated between middle-relief and starting pitching in &#x27;67, and finished with a neat 14-win, five-loss record (.737 winning percentage—best in the N.L.) and an even neater 2.43 ERA.

The great table-setter Lou Brock started things rolling in the first with a triple to left-center. Curt Flood followed with a single to center scoring Brock for the game&#x27;s first run. In the second, Tim McCarver led off with a single to center followed by a Mike Shannon home run to left. Ineffective Gary Bell was pinch-hit for in the third inning, replaced by Gary Waslewski. Waslewski pitched three perfect innings, striking out three before leaving in the sixth for relief pitcher Lee Stange.

Boston scored their first run in the sixth with Mike Andrews, (pinch-hitting for Bell), singling to center. Andrews took second on a Tartabull sacrifice, immediately scoring on a Dalton Jones base hit to right. But the Cards added some insurance in the bottom of the frame with the disconcerting Brock bunting for a hit, eventually going to third when Stange, attempting a pick-off, threw wild into right-field. Roger Maris, in his next-to-last season, would have a good Series with ten hits and a home run, scored Brock with a single to right-center.

In the seventh Reggie Smith hit a lead-off home run for Boston, trimming the score to 4–2 but the Cards stifled any further Sox comeback scoring their fifth run in the bottom of the eighth when Maris beat out an infield tap for a single and Orlando Cepeda muscled a double off the wall in right-center making the score 5–2. Briles would finish his complete-game victory with a 1–2–3 ninth, the second out recorded when Reggie Smith would interfere with McCarver who was trying to catch his pop-up foul down the first-base line. Up two games to one, St. Louis would send Bob Gibson back to the mound, a championship within reach.

===Game 4===

54,000 plus fans packed Busch Memorial Stadium in anticipation of yet another Bob Gibson post-season, pitching gem. Again, all St. Louis needed was a spark from Lou Brock and this time four runs crossed the plate in the first inning. Brock started things rolling with a slow-roller to third—nothing Dalton Jones could do could match Brock&#x27;s speed, for an infield-hit. Curt Flood singled to shallow left and Roger Maris powered-up going the other way, doubling into the left-field corner scoring both base-runners. Orlando Cepeda then flied out, Maris advancing to third. Tim McCarver hit a clutch single to right to score Maris. After Mike Shannon fouled out to Rico Petrocelli for the second out, Julián Javier would single in the hole between short and third followed by .217 lifetime hitter Dal Maxvill&#x27;s run-scoring single to left for the Cardinals&#x27; fourth run. That would be it for Game 1 starter José Santiago who would only last two-thirds of an inning this time out. Gary Bell would relieve, getting the ninth batter of the inning, Bob Gibson to fly out to left.

Gibson would be on cruise-control the remainder of the game while the Cards would add two more runs off reliever Jerry Stephenson in the third. Cepeda would double into the left-field corner and move to third on a wild pitch. McCarver would add a second RBI on a sac-fly to center scoring Cepeda. Shannon would walk and score on a Julián Javier double just inside the third-base line. That would be it for the scoring as Gibson would win his second Series game, a five-hit complete-game that put his Cardinals up, three games to one.

===Game 5===

With their backs up against the wall, manager Dick Williams again put his trust in the dependable Jim Lonborg. The 25-year-old righty was faced by Steve &quot;Lefty&quot; Carlton. Carlton was 14–9 in 30 games with a 2.98 ERA, striking out 168 in 193 innings during the regular season.

The game played out very tentatively, with just one early run scored by Boston in the top of the third. After Lonborg struck out leading off the inning, Joe Foy struck a single to left field. Mike Andrews reached safely at first after a sacrifice attempt was fumbled by Cardinal third-baseman Mike Shannon for an error. With two on and one out, team hero Carl Yastrzemski looked at a third strike for the second out, but Ken Harrelson followed with a clutch single to left, scoring Foy. This would be enough to saddle Carlton with the loss.

Pitching with a slight cold (and a paper horseshoe in his back pocket) Lonborg again sparkled, at one point retiring 12 straight. After a Roger Maris single in the fourth, the next batter to reach base was Julián Javier, who got on base in the eighth on an error by Rico Petrocelli. Carlton was just as good but left after six innings of work and would take the loss despite having no earned runs (the run in the third was unearned). He was replaced by Ray Washburn, who then pitched two scoreless innings.

St. Louis Manager Red Schoendienst brought in Ron Willis to pitch the ninth. The Red Sox greeted Willis by loading the bases on a George Scott walk, a Reggie Smith double, and an intentional walk to Petrocelli. Jack Lamabe relieved Willis after a 1–0 count on Elston Howard who promptly popped a single to right scoring Scott. Maris threw high to the plate, allowing Smith to score the second run. With the score 3–0, St. Louis came to bat in the last of the ninth in a last attempt comeback bid. But Lonborg&#x27;s luck continued, getting Brock and Flood to ground out to second and third respectively. Maris spoiled the shutout bid by homering over the right-field fence but Orlando Cepeda ended the game on a ground-out to third. The Red Sox were now back in the Series, although still down three games to two.

===Game 6===

Pivotal Game 6 matched rookie Gary Waslewski (2–2, 3.21) who had only pitched in 12 regular season games, versus one-year wonder Dick Hughes (16–6, 2.67) who pitched three seasons, winning only twice more in 1968 before retiring due to arm problems.

Rico Petrocelli gave the Red Sox an early lead with a second inning blast over the Green Monster in left field. St. Louis came back with two runs in the top of the third when Julián Javier hit a lead-off double off that same Green Monster. After retiring the next two batters, Waslewski gave up a single to Lou Brock, scoring Javier. Then after a Brock steal, Curt Flood singled to left, scoring Brock.

In the Sox half of the fourth, Carl Yastrzemski, Reggie Smith, and Rico Petrocelli would all go deep setting a new World Series record with three home runs in the same inning. A demoralized Hughes wouldn&#x27;t finish the inning and Ron Willis would be summoned from the bullpen to get the last out, an Elston Howard groundout to third.

Waslewski was very workmanlike, but started to tire in the sixth inning when, after giving up two walks, was replaced by John Wyatt who would get out of the jam retiring Mike Shannon on a popup to short and Javier on a fly to short right. The Cards would come back and hit Wyatt hard in the seventh. After pinch-hitter Bobby Tolan walked, Lou Brock hit a homer into the right-center field bleachers. Flood and Maris hit long fly-outs to center but their hits stayed in the park to end the inning, St. Louis had tied the score at four apiece.

The Red Sox would send ten batters to the plate in the bottom of the seventh inning and regain the lead. Elston Howard would lead off making both the first and last outs but four runs would cross the plate in-between. After all was said and done, the Cardinals would send four pitchers to the mound in the inning and when Hal Woodeshick would come into pitch the eighth, a Series record would be tied with eight (8) pitchers used also setting a two team record of 11 pitchers used. St. Louis had one more good chance to win the game loading the bases in the eighth, but highlighted by a great Yastrzemski catch in left-center, the Cards couldn&#x27;t push one across and wouldn&#x27;t score again going quietly in the ninth; with Gary Bell pitching the last two innings for the save. The Red Sox survived to play another day and the Series was now tied at three games apiece. Wyatt took the win and Jack Lamabe, who was the first pitcher for the Cardinals in the eighth, would be given the loss.

===Game 7===

The seventh game finally matched up the aces, Bob Gibson against Jim Lonborg. Lonborg was pitching on two-days rest, while Gibson had rested an extra day since his last outing. Only once before had a seventh game of a Series brought together starting pitchers who both had 2–0 records in the Series—in 1925, when the Washington Senators&#x27; Walter Johnson pitched against the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; Vic Aldridge. The Cardinals players were angered by the quip &quot;Lonborg and Champagne&quot; which was Dick Williams&#x27; response when asked after Game 6 who was to be the Red Sox starting pitcher for the Series-deciding contest and the headline dominating the front page of Boston&#x27;s &quot;Record American&quot; the morning of Game 7.

From the start, it was apparent that Lonborg was struggling. Three Cardinal hits and a wild pitch put St. Louis ahead 2–0 in the third inning. Two more scored in the fifth on a home run by Gibson, Lou Brock&#x27;s single and two stolen bases (his seventh steal—a new Series record), and a Roger Maris sacrifice-fly to right. A Boston run in the fifth cut the score to 4–1, but the Red Sox dream was abruptly halted in the sixth on a three-run homer by Julián Javier off the arm-weary Lonborg to end his night in the sixth inning. Gibson allowed only one other Boston run for another complete game, striking out 10. With the 7–2 defeat, Boston&#x27;s &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; ended one win short, and the St. Louis Cardinals were World Series Champions for the second time in the 1960s, and eighth overall.

==Aftermath==
The 1967 Series was the first non-exhibition meeting between Major League Baseball teams from St. Louis and Boston since the departures of the Boston Braves and St. Louis Browns following (respectively) the 1952 and 1953 seasons ended regular season meetings between teams from those cities (Braves vs Cardinals, Browns vs Red Sox). It also marked the last time that a St. Louis-based team defeated a Boston-based team in the championship round of any professional sport until 2019 when the St. Louis Blues defeated the Boston Bruins 4 games to 3 in the Stanley Cup Finals. In the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals the Bruins swept the Blues with Bobby Orr scoring the memorable series-winning goal in overtime in Game 4. The New England Patriots followed suit by defeating the St. Louis Rams&#x27; &quot;Greatest Show on Turf&quot; team 20–17 in Super Bowl XXXVI after the 2001 NFL season, with kicker Adam Vinatieri scoring the game-winning field goal on the final play. In the 2004 World Series, the Red Sox swept the Cardinals in four to break the &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;, then bested them again in six games nine years later. In the NBA Finals, the Boston Celtics and St. Louis Hawks met four times in five years, with the Celtics winning in 1957, 1960 and 1961 and the Hawks winning in 1958. (The Hawks moved to Atlanta in 1968.)

This was the first year since 1948 that neither the Yankees, nor the Giants, nor the Dodgers played in the World Series. It would be another seven years before the Dodgers would return to the series and nine before the Yankees came back. The Giants would not play again in a World Series until .

This was the Cardinals&#x27; first World Series that was not played in Sportsman&#x27;s Park, which had closed partway through the 1966 season. It was the first of six played in Busch Memorial Stadium, also known as Busch Stadium II, which opened in 1966 to replace Sportsman&#x27;s Park (which had been renamed Busch Stadium in 1953).

This would be the Cardinals second and final World Series win of the 1960s. The next year, they lost to Detroit in seven games. St. Louis wouldn&#x27;t get back to the World Series until 1982 when they beat Milwaukee.

<doc id="1119348" wikidata="Q1196647" url="?curid=1119348" title="Japanese ironclad Kōtetsu">
<text>, later renamed , was the first ironclad warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy. She was designed as an armored ram for service in shallow waters, but also carried three guns. The ship was built in Bordeaux, France, for the Confederate States Navy under the cover name Sphinx, but was sold to Denmark after the sale of warships by French builders to the Confederacy was forbidden in 1863. The Danes refused to accept the ship and sold her to the Confederates which commissioned her as CSS &quot;Stonewall&quot; in 1865. The ship did not reach Confederate waters before the end of the American Civil War in April and was turned over to the United States.

The Tokugawa shogunate of Japan bought her from the United States in 1867 and renamed her &quot;Kōtetsu&quot;, but delivery was held up by the Americans until after the Imperial faction had established control over most of the country. She was finally delivered in March 1869 to the new government and had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the completion of the military phase of the Meiji Restoration.

Renamed &quot;Azuma&quot; in 1871, she played minor roles in the Saga Rebellion and the Taiwan Expedition, both in 1874. The ship ran aground later that year, but was refloated and repaired. During the Satsuma Rebellion three years later, she was little used. &quot;Azuma&quot; was stricken in 1888 and was sold for scrap the following year.

==Description==
&quot;Sphinx&quot; was long between perpendiculars and had an overall length of including her prominent pointed naval ram. The ship had a beam of and a draught of . The brig&#x27;s composite hull was sheathed in copper to protect it from parasites and biofouling and it featured a pronounced tumblehome. She displaced and her crew numbered 135 officers and crewmen. To improve her maneuverability the ship was fitted with twin rudders.

Her main battery consisted of a single 300-pounder Armstrong rifled muzzle-loading (RML) gun located in the bow turret in a pivot mount. The fixed turret had three or five gun ports. A pair of 70-pounder Armstrong RML guns were positioned in the oval fixed turret abaft the mainmast, one pivot mount on each broadside firing through two gun ports. The Japanese removed one of the 70-pounder guns and added a pair of Armstrong 6-pounder guns, four 4-pounder field guns and a Gatling gun.

The ship was designed to withstand hits by guns. Her hull was protected by a wrought-iron armored belt that extended below the waterline that was backed by about 15 inches of teak. The hull armor was amidships and tapered to towards the bow and stern. Above it was a strake of armor thick. The bow turret was protected with armor and the amidships turret was fitted with armor plates.

The power plant consisted of a pair of Mazeline horizontal two-cylinder single-expansion steam engines, each driving a four-bladed, screw using steam provided by two Mazeline tubular boilers. The engines were rated at a total of . The ship reached a maximum speed of during her sea trials on 9 October 1864. She had an estimated range of with a full load of of coal.

==Origins and career==
In June 1863, John Slidell, the Confederate commissioner to France, asked Emperor Napoleon III in a private audience if it would be possible for the Confederate government to build ironclad warships in France. Arming ships of war for a recognized belligerent like the Confederate States would have been illegal under French law, but Slidell and his agent, James D. Bulloch, were confident that the Emperor of France would be able to circumvent his own laws more easily than other potential secret contractors. Napoleon III agreed to the building of ironclads in France on the condition that their destination remain a secret. The following month Bulloch entered a contract with Lucien Arman, a French shipbuilder and a personal confidant of Napoleon III, to build a pair of ironclad rams capable of breaking the Union blockade. To avoid suspicion, the ships&#x27; guns were manufactured separately from the ship herself and the pair were named &quot;Cheops&quot; and &quot;Sphinx&quot; to encourage rumors that they were intended for the Egyptian Navy.

Prior to delivery, however, a shipyard clerk walked into the U.S. Minister&#x27;s office in Paris and produced documents which revealed that Arman had fraudulently obtained authorization to arm the ships and was in contact with Confederate agents. The French government blocked the sale under pressure from the United States, but Arman was able to sell the ships to Denmark and Prussia, which were then fighting on opposite sides of the Second Schleswig War. &quot;Cheops&quot; was sold to Prussia as , while &quot;Sphinx&quot; was sold to Denmark under the name &quot;Stærkodder&quot; on 31 March 1864.

Manned by a Danish crew, the ship left Bordeaux for its shakedown cruise on 21 June 1864. The crew tested the vessel while final negotiations were being conducted between the Danish Naval Ministry and Arman. Intense haggling over the final price and a disagreement over compensation from the company for cited problems and late delivery led to negotiations breaking down on 30 October, although the ship had set sail for Copenhagen, Denmark, on 25 October. The Danish government refused to relinquish the vessel, claiming confusion in regards to the negotiations. She arrived in Copenhagen on 10 November and was in the dockyard at the beginning of 1865.

===American career===
At the beginning of 1865 the Danes sold the ship to the Confederacy. On 6 January the vessel took aboard a Confederate States Navy crew at Copenhagen under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Jefferson Page, although the ship was still commanded by a Danish captain when she put to sea the following day. Heavy weather forced the ship to take refuge at Elsinore, but she set sail shortly afterward for the French coast. She also used the cover name &quot;Olinde&quot; during this time. There she rendezvoused with the new British blockade runner &quot;City of Richmond&quot;, taking on supplies and ammunition, as well as more crewmen, from and . During this time she was commissioned CSS &quot;Stonewall&quot; while still at sea and Page assumed command of the ship. High seas in the Bay of Biscay damaged her rudders while en route for the island of Madeira, Portugal, and forced the ship to seek refuge in Ferrol, Spain. Permanent repairs took several months and provided time for the Union to be notified of the ship&#x27;s location.

In February and March, the Union steam frigate and steam sloop kept watch from a distance as &quot;Stonewall&quot; lay anchored off A Coruña, waiting for &quot;Stonewall&quot; to finish her repairs. On 24 March Page put to sea, prepared to engage them, but the unarmored Union ships declined to fight. &quot;Stonewall&quot; steamed for Lisbon, Portugal, to re-coal, intending to cross the Atlantic Ocean from there. &quot;Stonewall&quot; reached Nassau, Bahamas, on 6 May and then sailed on to Havana, Cuba, where Page learned of the war&#x27;s end when he arrived five days later.

Union ships first arrived at Havana on 15 May and were reinforced over the course of the month, to include the monitors and . Page decided to turn &quot;Stonewall&quot; over to the Spanish Captain General of Cuba for the sum of $16,000 to pay the crew&#x27;s wages. The vessel would then be turned over to United States representatives in return for reimbursement of the same amount. The Americans did not pay until 2 November and &quot;Stonewall&quot; required some repairs before she could put to sea again. Escorted by the paddle steamers and , the ironclad departed Havana on 15 November and arrived at the Washington Navy Yard on 24 November. While sailing through Chesapeake Bay on the night of 22/23 November, &quot;Stonewall&quot; accidentally rammed and sank a coal schooner off Smith Island, Maryland; there were no deaths. She was subsequently paid off and laid up at the Washington Navy Yard.

===Japanese career===

Seeking to reinforce its fleet with modern warships, the Tokugawa shogunate sent representatives to the United States in 1867, seeking to purchase surplus ships.
Acting envoy to the United States Ono Tomogoro discovered &quot;Stonewall&quot; in the Washington Navy Yard in May and made a formal offer to the United States government for the purchase of the ironclad. The purchase was concluded for the price of $400,000 and she was turned over to the Japanese on 5 August who renamed her &quot;Kōtetsu&quot;. However, by the time of her arrival in Shinagawa harbor on 22 January 1868, the Boshin War between the shogunate and pro-Imperial forces had begun, and the United States took a neutral stance, stopping the delivery of military material, including the delivery of &quot;Kōtetsu&quot;, to the Shogunate. The ship had arrived under a Japanese flag with an American crew, but the US Resident-Minister, Robert B. Van Valkenburg, ordered her put back under the American flag. &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; was finally delivered to the new Meiji government in early March 1869.

====Boshin War====

Before &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; was turned over to the Japanese, Tokugawa admiral Enomoto Takeaki refused to surrender his warships after the surrender of Edo Castle to the new government, and escaped to Hakodate in Hokkaido with the remainder of the Tokugawa Navy and a handful of French military advisers and their leader Jules Brunet. His fleet of eight steam warships was the strongest in Japan at the time. On 27 January 1869, Tokugawa loyalists declared the foundation of the Republic of Ezo and elected Enomoto as president. The Meiji government refused to accept partition of Japan and dispatched its newly formed Imperial Japanese Navy, which consisted of &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; as the flagship and a collection of various steam-powered warships that had been contributed by the various feudal domains loyal to the new government. On 25 March 1869, during the Battle of Miyako Bay, &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; successfully repulsed a surprise night attempt at naval boarding by the rebel (spearheaded by survivors from the &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;), making use of a mounted Gatling gun. &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; subsequently supported the invasion of Hokkaidō and various naval engagements in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay.

====Subsequent career====
Following the end of the Boshin War in August 1870, &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; was classified as a third-class warship on 15 November 1871 and was renamed &quot;Azuma&quot; on 7 December. By January 1873, her fighting ability was assessed as low. &quot;Azuma&quot; was assigned to guard Nagasaki during the Saga rebellion in February 1874 and during the Taiwan Expedition of May 1874. On 19 August she ran aground at Kagoshima during a typhoon, but was refloated and repaired at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. During the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, she was assigned to guard duties in the Seto Inland Sea. She was stricken from the navy list on 28 January 1888, and was sold for scrap on 12 December 1889. Her armor plating was reused to make the armature shafts in the electric generators in the Asakusa Thermal Power Station, built in Tokyo in 1895.

<text>Neyland Stadium ( ) is a sports stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. It serves primarily as the home of the Tennessee Volunteers football team, but is also used to host large conventions and has been a site for several National Football League (NFL) exhibition games. The stadium&#x27;s official capacity is 101,915. Constructed in 1921 as Shields–Watkins Field (which is now the name of the playing surface), the stadium has undergone 16 expansion projects, at one point reaching a capacity of 104,079 before being slightly reduced by alterations in the following decade. Neyland Stadium is the sixth largest stadium in the United States, the eighth largest stadium in the world, and the third largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference. The stadium is named for Robert Neyland, who served three stints as head football coach at the University of Tennessee between 1926 and 1952.

==History==

The Tennessee Volunteers football team originally played at Baldwin Park, which was once located between Grand Avenue and Dale Avenue, north of Fort Sanders. From 1908 to 1920, the team played at Wait Field, which was located where the Walters Life Science Building now stands.

The stadium was first conceived in 1919. Colonel W.S. Shields, president of Knoxville&#x27;s City National Bank and a University of Tennessee trustee, provided the initial capital to prepare and equip an athletic field. Thus, when the original stadiumthe lower level of the current stadium&#x27;s West Standswas completed in March 1921, it was called Shields–Watkins Field in honor of the donor and his wife, Alice Watkins-Shields. However, the project ran out of funds and was suspended temporarily until MacGregor Smith suggested at a meeting of the university&#x27;s Scarabbean Senior Society in mid 1921 that the students and faculty finish the project together. At the group&#x27;s behest, students and faculty finished the field over a two-day period. An invitational track meet was then held as a celebration and thus became the first event at Neyland Stadium. The first UT football game at the stadium took place on September 24, 1921, with the Vols defeating Emory &amp; Henry, 27–0. The first night game at Neyland Stadium was played on September 16, 1972, with the Vols defeating Penn State, 28–21.
In 1962, the stadium was renamed Neyland Stadium in honor of General Robert Neyland, the recently deceased former athletic director and coach. Neyland, the man credited with making the Vols a national football power, coached the team from 1926 to 1952, with two interruptions for military service. In 1968, the stadium became one of the first stadiums to have an artificial turf surface. It stayed until natural grass was restored to the field in 1994. Reflecting the Vols&#x27; growth in stature, the stadium&#x27;s capacity jumped more than 14-fold during his 38-year association with UT as either an assistant coach (1925), head coach (three separate tenures from 1926 to 1952), or athletic director (1946–1962). By comparison, when Neyland arrived in Knoxville in 1925, Shields-Watkins Field was not even a fraction the size of Tennessee&#x27;s largest stadium at the time Vanderbilt&#x27;s Dudley Field. Shortly before his death, he spearheaded the stadium&#x27;s first major expansion. The plans he drafted were so far ahead of their time that they have formed the basis for every expansion since then. The playing surface is still named Shields–Watkins Field.

The latest additions and updates to the facility were part of a $136.4 million series of renovations, beginning in 2004 and completed by 2010. They included the bricking around the field and the removal of the previous hedges, numerous changes to the inside and outside of the stadium structure, additions and reconfigurations of seating areas, as well as new home locker, press, and varsity rooms.

In a Spring 2001 poll in &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, Neyland Stadium was ranked as the nation&#x27;s #1 college football stadium. In 2004, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked Neyland Stadium, the University of Tennessee campus, and the surrounding Knoxville area, as the best college football weekend experience. On April 8, 2009, it was announced that Neyland Stadium was one of seventy stadiums named for the United States&#x27; bid to host either the 2018 or 2022 World Cup.

===Attendance records===
Attendance has been recorded for Tennessee Volunteer football games at Neyland Stadium since 1946. Average attendance since that year has been 68,925 fans per game. The largest crowd ever recorded at Neyland Stadium was 109,061 on September 18, 2004, when Tennessee defeated Florida, 30–28. Tennessee set a school record by averaging 107,595 fans per home game in 2000.

===Vols&#x27; performance at Neyland===

Through week one of the 2022 season, the Tennessee Volunteers football team had compiled a record of 485 wins, 141 losses, and 17 ties at Neyland, for a winning percentage of . The team has had 37 perfect home records, the last coming in the 2022 season. The team&#x27;s longest home winning streak was 30, set between December 8, 1928, and October 21, 1933. The Vols have never had more than four consecutive losses at Neyland Stadium.

===Other uses===
Neyland Stadium is occasionally used for concerts, political rallies, and religious gatherings. One of Neyland Stadium&#x27;s most notable non-sporting events took place in May 1970, when the stadium hosted the Billy Graham Crusade, with President Richard Nixon as a guest speaker. The event occurred just three weeks after the Kent State shootings, at the height of the anti-war movement, and several anti-war protestors were arrested for trying to disrupt the event. The Jacksons performed three concerts at Neyland Stadium in August 1984, during their Victory Tour. East Tennessee native Kenny Chesney performed in Neyland Stadium in June 2003.

Neyland Stadium has hosted several NFL exhibition games, most recently in 1995, when the Washington Redskins played the Houston Oilers. The Knox County Football Jamboree, a preseason event for local high school teams, was held annually at the stadium until 2013. The discontinuation of the Jamboree at Neyland Stadium was due in part to maintaining the condition of the field in the month prior to the beginning of college football.

==Structure and seating==
===Growth===

Shields–Watkins Field opened in 1921 with a single grandstand along the west sideline–the lower portion of the current facility&#x27;s West Stands–having a capacity of 3,200. The East Stands were added five years later in 1926 to increase capacity to 6,800. The West Stands were increased from 17 rows to 42 rows in 1930, increasing capacity to 17,860.

In 1937, a small row of seats (called North Section X) was constructed across the north end zone, adding 1,500 seats. The next year, in 1938, the East Stands were expanded to 44 rows. The capacity after these expansions was 31,390.

In 1948, the south end zone was enclosed in a &quot;horseshoe&quot; style (see Harvard Stadium for an example) with 15,000 seats, bringing total capacity to 46,290.

Several expansions were undertaken in the 1960s. First, in 1962, the West Stands were double-decked, adding 5,837 seats and a press box. In 1966 North SectionX was replaced by a grandstand (the North Stands) with 5,895 seats. In 1968, the East Stands were double-decked as well (6,307), bringing total capacity to 64,429.

The two Upper Decks were connected to fully enclose the south end zone during two expansions in 1972 and 1976. The 1972 Southwest Upper Deck addition extended the West Upper Deck to the south by 6,221 seats, and the 1976 Southeast Upper Deck addition extended the East Upper Deck to the south by 9,600, giving contiguous upper seating around three sides, and increasing total capacity to 80,250.

In 1980, the North Stands were rebuilt, netting a capacity increase of 10,999 seats. It also enclosed the north end zone in a &quot;bowl&quot; style (see Rose Bowl and Yale Bowl for examples). A net loss of seats in 1987 to accommodate the West Executive Suites construction was more than offset by a student seating adjustment in 1990, increasing capacity to a total of 91,902.

In 1996, the last major expansion was completed with the North Upper Deck to fully enclose the upper level, giving a net gain of 10,642 seats. A 1997 seating adjustment to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was followed by addition of the East Executive Suites, topping total capacity at 104,037 in 2000.

The addition of the East and West Club Seats in 2006 and 2009, respectively, decreased the total capacity to 100,011. In 2010, the completion of the Tennessee Terrace raised stadium capacity to its current total of 102,455 people.

===2004–2010 renovations===
In 2004, the University of Tennessee implemented the Neyland Stadium Master Plan, a long-term strategy for expanding, renovating, and maintaining the stadium. The plan called for the addition of club seats, widening of concourses, creation of entry plazas, and updates to the stadium&#x27;s infrastructure. The estimated $200 million renovations, which will be carried out over a series of several phases, are to be funded entirely by private donations and revenue generated from priority and club seats.

Phase I of the master plan, completed in 2006 at a cost of $26 million, involved the addition of the East Club Seats, renovation and widening of the north lower concourse, the addition of LED signage, and the addition of extra restrooms and concessions. The East Club Seats, built on the East Upper Deck, includes 422 seats and an adjoining club room overlooking the Tennessee River.
Phase II of the master plan, completed in 2008 at a cost of $27.4 million, involved the renovation and widening of the west lower concourse, renovations to the Peyton Manning Locker Complex and the concourse connecting it with Shields–Watkins Field, and the construction of the Lauricella Center for Letter Winners and the Stokely Family Media Room. The Lauricella Center for Letter Winners, named for Vol All American running back Hank Lauricella, sits adjacent to the locker complex, and provides a gathering area for athletes, coaches, and their family members. The Stokely Family Media Room provides a setting for press conferences and coach and player interviews.
Phase III of the master plan, completed in 2010 at a cost of $83 million, included the construction of the West Club Seats, improvements to the Executive Suites and press box, renovations to the west top level concourse, the addition of elevators and stairwells to the West Side, the creation of the Gate 21 Plaza and other entry plazas, the construction of the Tennessee Terrace, and the installation of a statue of General Neyland, created by sculptor Blair Buswell, to the west entrance. The West Club Seats are similar to the East Club Seats, with 422 seats and an adjoining club room. The Tennessee Terrace features 1,782 priority seats, with an adjacent climate-controlled concourse area, overlooking the west sideline.

Phases IV and V will involve renovation of the south and east concourses and the creation of an entry plaza at Gate 10.

==Shields–Watkins Field==
From 1921 to the end of the 1967 season, the field surface was natural grass. In 1964, the orange-and-white checkerboard end zones were added. This was one of the many changes initiated by new head coach Doug Dickey, who also added the &quot;T&quot; logo to the football helmet and initiated the tradition of the team running onto the field through the &quot;Power T&quot; formed by the Pride of the Southland Band, and moved the Tennessee bench from the east side line to the west side line.
In 1968, coinciding with the addition of the East Upper Deck, Tennessee-Turf (TartanTurf-3M) was installed as the playing surface, in part to provide better drainage following heavy rains. The checkerboard end zones were initially not included as part of the Tennessee-Turf playing surface. End zone designs used through the years on the artificial surface included having TENNESSEE and VOLUNTEERS in orange turf lettering and the end zone green turf. The end zones, as well as the midfield logo, were unique in that they were separate pieces of contrasting turf rather than painted turf. The artificial surface, as many from this era, was blamed for excessive leg injuries. In 1989, the orange-and-white checkerboard end zone patterns were restored, and an interlocking &quot;UT&quot; was placed at midfield.

The artificial surface was used through the 1993 season, the last game on the surface being a 62–14 win over Vanderbilt. Afterwards the surface was ripped up and sections were auctioned off to raise funds for the university. The turf was replaced with natural grass the following year, with the checkerboard end zones and midfield logo retained. In 1998, the interlocking &quot;UT&quot; was replaced with the same Power T logo as seen on the football helmets. Since 2007, the entire surface gets re-sodded annually with Tifway Bermuda grass, which rests on a 12-inch bed of sand to enhance drainage.

<doc id="1119390" wikidata="Q466151" url="?curid=1119390" title="Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov">
<text>Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov (; ) was a Russian nobleman and field-marshal, renowned for his success in the Napoleonic Wars and most famous for his participation in the Caucasian War from 1844 to 1853.

==Early life==
Vorontsov was born on 30 May 1782, in Saint Petersburg in the Russian Empire. He was the only son of Ekaterina Alekseevna Seniavina and Count Semyon Vorontsov. Mikail and his sister, Catherine (who later became the wife of George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke), spent their childhood and youth with his father in London, where his father was the Russian Ambassador to Great Britain.

He was the nephew of Imperial Chancellor Alexander Vorontsov, Elizaveta Vorontsova and Princess Dashkova, a friend of Catherine the Great and a conspirator in the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that deposed Tsar Peter III and put his wife on the throne.

==Career==

From 1803 to 1804, he served in the Caucasus under Pavel Tsitsianov and Gulyakov. From 1805 to 1807, he served in the Napoleonic Wars and was present at the battles of Pułtusk and Friedland. From 1809 to 1811 he participated in the Russo-Turkish War.
He commanded the composite grenadiers division in Prince Petr Bagration&#x27;s Second Western Army during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia in 1812. At the Battle of Borodino, his division was on the front line and was attacked by three French divisions under Marshal Davout. Of the 4,000 men in his division, only 300 survived the battle. Vorontsov was wounded but recovered to rejoin the army in 1813. He commanded a new grenadiers division and fought at the Battle of Dennewitz and the Battle of Leipzig. He was the commander of the corps of occupation in France from 1815 to 1818.

On 7 May 1823 he was appointed governor-general of New Russia, as the southern provinces of the empire were then called, and &quot;namestnik&quot; of Bessarabia.
In the year of the start of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, Vorontsov succeeded the wounded Menshikov as commander of the forces besieging Varna, which he captured on 28 September 1828. It was through his energetic efforts that the plague, which had broken out in the Ottoman Empire, did not penetrate into Russia.

In 1844, Vorontsov was appointed commander-in-chief and viceroy of the Caucasus (for military details see Murid War). At the Battle of Dargo (1845), he was nearly defeated and barely fought his way out of the Chechen forest. 

By 1848 he had captured two-thirds of Dagestan, and the situation of the Russians in the Caucasus, so long almost desperate, was steadily improving. For his campaign against Shamil, and for his difficult march through the dangerous forests of Ichkeria, he was raised to the dignity of prince, with the title of Serene Highness. In the beginning of 1853, Vorontsov was allowed to retire because of his increasing infirmities. He was made a field-marshal in 1856, and died the same year at Odessa. His archives were published, in 40 volumes, by Pyotr Bartenev between 1870 and 1897.

==Personal life==

Vorontsov was married to Polish Countess Elżbieta &quot;Elisabeth&quot; Branicka, a daughter of Count Franciszek Ksawery Branicki and Aleksandra von Engelhardt (a member of the powerful Engelhardt family). Her brother was Count Władysław Grzegorz Branicki who married Countess Róża Potocka (daughter of Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki). His wife reportedly had a liaison with Alexander Pushkin during her stay in Odessa, which resulted in some of the finest poems in the Russian language. Together, Mikhail and Elisabeth were the parents of:

* Prince Semyon Mikhailovich Vorontsov (1823–1882), who began construction of Massandra Palace upon his return from the Russo-Turkish War but died before completion; he married, against his parents&#x27; wishes, Maria Vasilyevna Stolypina, née Princess Trubetskoy (1819-1895), daughter of Prince Vasily Sergeevich Trubetskoy (1773-1841) and Sophia Andreevna Weiss (1795-1848); widow of Alexei Grigoryevich Stolypin. They married in Alupka on August 26, 1851.
* Princess Sofya Mikhailovna Vorontsova (1825–1879), who married Count Andrey Pavlovich Shuvalov in 1844.

Prince Vorontsov died on 18 November 1856 in Odessa.

===Descendants===
As his son died without issue, his grandson through his daughter Sofya, Count Mikhail Andreyevich Shuvalov (1850–1903), inherited the title of Prince Vorontsov. Upon his death, without issue in 1903, the Vorontsov fortune passed to his elder sister, Countess Elizabeth Andreevna Shuvalova (1845–1924), who had married Count Illarion Vorontsov-Dashkov.

===Legacy===

Between 1828 and 1848, Vorontsov built Vorontsov Palace as a summer residence for 9 million roubles. The palace is located at the foot of the Crimean Mountains near the town of Alupka in Crimea. Today, it is one of the oldest and largest palaces in Crimea and one of the most popular tourist attractions on Crimea&#x27;s southern coast. It was designed in a loose interpretation of the English Renaissance revival style by English architect Edward Blore and his assistant William Hunt. The building is a hybrid of several architectural styles, but faithful to none. Among those styles are elements of Scottish Baronial, Indo-Saracenic Revival Architecture, and Gothic Revival architecture. The house stayed in the family until four years after the October Revolution when it was nationalised in 1921 and converted into a museum.

A statue of Prince Vorontsov was unveiled in Odesa in 1863. On 11 November 2023 the monumental status of this sculpture was scrapped in order to comply with 2023 derussification-laws. In front of the statue stands the Transfiguration Cathedral with the marble tombs of Prince Vorontsov and his wife. After the Soviets demolished the cathedral in 1936, Vorontsov&#x27;s remains were secretly reburied in a local cemetery. The cathedral was rebuilt in the early 2000s. The remains of Vorontsov and his wife were solemnly transferred to the church in 2005.

<text>The Mitsubishi Colt is a nameplate from Mitsubishi Motors that has been applied to a number of automobiles since 1962. It was first introduced with a series of kei and subcompact cars in the 1960s, and then for the export version of the subcompact Mirage between 1978 and 2002. Chrysler, Mitsubishi&#x27;s longtime partner, also used the name when applying its long-running practice of rebadging Mitsubishi vehicles as the Dodge and Plymouth Colt captive imports for the North American market between 1970 and 1994.

The most recent version was a subcompact car model manufactured between 2002 and 2013, sold under the Colt nameplate internationally. Mitsubishi replaced this series in 2013 with a newer generation which reverted to the Mirage name.

In addition to these small cars, &quot;Colt&quot; in the Mitsubishi vernacular has been used for unrelated vehicles of various forms as discussed below. The name has also been disaffiliated from Mitsubishi as an independent marque in some markets.

== Nameplate history ==


The &quot;Colt&quot; nameplate was first introduced in 1962, which started as a line of small cars sold predominantly in Japan. These models continued on in various similar forms until 1971. Between 1978 and 2002, the nameplate was applied to export versions of the Mirage in markets such as Europe and for a time, in Australia. Between 2002 and 2013, the nameplate was referred to a subcompact hatchback (and derivative body styles) that replaced the Mirage line. Unlike previously, the &quot;Colt&quot; nameplate was used internationally.

Various other unrelated models have been designated &quot;Colt&quot; over time as well. The L200 pickup truck in South Africa utilised the &quot;Colt&quot; nameplate from 1992 to 2008. The nameplate is also used in export markets for a series of light commercial vehicles consisting of Delica-based &quot;Colt T100/T120/L300/1400&quot; (1968–present), Suzuki Carry-based &quot;Colt T120SS&quot; (1991–2019), and Canter-based &quot;Colt T200/Diesel&quot; (1975–2022).

Colt was also used as a marque from 1974 to 1984 by the Colt Car Company to market Mitsubishi vehicles in the United Kingdom. In New Zealand, the Colt brand ceased in favour of the Mitsubishi name in 1970, upon the release of the &quot;Dyna-wedge&quot; Galant model.

== Colt 600, 800, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1500 (1962–1971) ==
Mitsubishi introduced the &quot;Colt&quot; name in 1962 on the Mitsubishi Colt 600, the first of a line of small family cars complementing their Mitsubishi 500, the company&#x27;s first post-war passenger car. The Colt 600 is powered by a 594 cc &quot;NE35B&quot; OHV air-cooled straight-twin engine. At this time, Mitsubishi did not yet exist as an autonomous company, and vehicles were being produced by three regional subsidiaries of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. MHI, which had been formally dismantled after World War II, resumed operating as a single entity in 1964, but continued to use the &quot;Colt&quot; marque until the 1970s in Asia, and the 1980s in Europe.

To complement the 600, a larger compact car was introduced in 1963, the Colt 1000. The larger Colt 1500 arrived in 1965, the Colt 1100 replaced the Colt 1000 in 1966, and the Colt 1200 took the 1100s place in 1968.

The third Colt line was the smaller, fastback Colt 800 and its derivatives the 1000F, 1100F, and 11-F. This series was built from 1965 until late 1971.

== Mirage-based Colt (1978–2002) ==
Mitsubishi reintroduced the Colt nameplate as a front-wheel drive hatchback in 1978, with a sedan later released in 1982. Sold in Japan as the Mirage, the Colt name was restricted to markets such as Europe and Australia (where the Colt was built by Mitsubishi Motors Australia from 1982 to late 1989).

Five generations of Mirage-based Colts were sold between 1978 and 2002, with new generations released in 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1995. These Mirage derivatives were sold in various forms as the Mitsubishi Lancer in many markets, with the Colt nameplate in Europe typically restricted to the hatchback variants; sedans and station wagons were relegated to the Lancer name.

== Colt (Z30; 2002) ==
In November 2002, a new Colt was released by Mitsubishi in Japan with a design by Olivier Boulay and built on the same platform as the Smart Forfour. In Japan, it was sold at a specific retail chain called &quot;Galant Shop&quot;. A European version made at Mitsubishi&#x27;s NedCar facility followed into production a year later (see below). This generation is not sold in the United States.

In 2004, the Colt was launched in Europe and Australia, with models including a 1.1, 1.3, and a 1.5-litre, fuel injected petrol engines with MIVEC as well as a turbocharged version of the 1.5. A three-door arrived in 2005 for Europe only.

The Smart Forfour also shared the 2003 specification chassis, with Brabus releasing a performance version of the Forfour in 2004 using the same engine as used in the 2004 European cz-&quot;T&quot;, but squeezing extra out of the same 4G15.

In November 2004, a 1.5 L D-ID direct injection turbo-diesel version with turbocharger and intercooler, producing was made available, with an option of the &quot;Allshift&quot; automated manual gearbox with electrohydraulic clutch and six gears.

The performance specification 1.5 T was based on the 4G15 block, with a Turbo and Intercooler to aid power (up to at 6000 rpm and torque at 3500 rpm). MIVEC variable valve timing was also used to increase the output, upping the power dramatically from the 1.5 MPI. The same performance engine was also used to power the later released CZC cabrio model Colt (2005), with the more petrol-friendly 1.5 MPI available as an option.

Mitsubishi released its new Colt CZC coupé cabriolet at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2005, and the car has been on sale since 2006. The car is a 2+2 with a retractable hard-top and available with the turbo engine from the European CZ-&quot;T&quot; or as just a 1.5 MPI. Jointly developed by Mitsubishi and Pininfarina under Ken Okuyama, it was partially made in the Netherlands, with final assembly taking part at Pininfarina in Turin, Italy.

=== Colt Ralliart Version-R ===
Mitsubishi released the Colt Ralliart Version-R in Japan on 30 May 2006. Its &quot;4G15&quot; engine, with MIVEC variable valve timing and turbocharger, produces at 6000 rpm and at 3500 rpm for the manual model, with torque reduced to at 2500 rpm for the CVT model. Other key features include a stiffer spot welded chassis, stiffer suspensions, improved exhaust system, improved steering mounting, body kit, 240 km/h speedometer, low profile high-grip 16-inch tires (205/45R16), and Recaro bucket seats borrowed from the Lancer Evolution VIII MR. The rear seats are moulded for two passengers, as opposed to three in the rest of the range. Incidentally, this is the same engine used in the 2004 European performance specification Colt (CZ-&quot;T&quot;), only running slightly increased horsepower figures (torque stayed the same). This version is also sold in Australia and New Zealand as the Colt Ralliart, without the &#x27;Version-R&#x27; designation. The CVT version is officially sold in Singapore and Hong Kong under the same designation as Japan.

In 2008, the Version R went through a minor facelift with its engine uprated to at 6000 rpm and 210 N·m (150 lb·ft) at 3500 rpm for the manual model. The CVT model&#x27;s output remained as before. In Australia and New Zealand the 2008 and onwards models were fitted with lighter rims and chrome headlamps, but the sunglass holder and front Recaro seats were removed and replaced with standard sports seats to reflect a reduced retail price.

Also in 2008, a limited version called Colt Ralliart Version-R Special was launched in the Japanese market for a limited number of 300 units. The difference from the usual version is further stiffer continuous seam-welded chassis and a Ralliart muffler. Another 200 units of Version-R Special were launched in 2010.

In Switzerland, presents itself as a sporty top model from 2008 - apart from the former Colt CZT with turbocharged - the CZT Ralliart high performance version with at 6000 rpm and at 3500 rpm. The extensive modifications include a lowered ride height, a reinforcement of the rear axle, and a tighter coordination of shock absorbers and springs. Special front and rear spoilers and side skirts provide the appropriate visual appearance.

=== Colt MIEV ===
In 2006 Mitsubishi displayed the Colt MIEV, using a separate electric motor at each wheel. Development of their MIEV technology was first announced May 2006 when Mitsubishi unveiled the Colt version is a rear-wheel drive all-electric vehicle fitted Colt MIEV test-bed. With two 20 kW in-wheel motors. The Colt MIEV has a top speed of and a cruising range of on a single charge. Charge times have been suggested to be a quick as 10 minutes, although whether this is partial or full is undisclosed. It does however point to the usage of quick-charge batteries such as those developed by Toshiba.

Mitsubishi used the Colt test bed to perform on-road testing to identify and resolve any problems unique to the in-wheel motor vehicle, including any deterioration in road holding and ride comfort due to increases in unsprung weight, as well as reliability and durability issues in the in-wheel motor system and its peripheral components (suspension, wheels, tires). They simultaneously worked on developing a more powerful version of the in wheel motors for 4WD applications.

=== Colt Plus ===
In 2004, the Colt Plus was launched in Japan, and later to other international markets. This was essentially a longer version of the standard Colt with around more boot space compared to the regular colt. The Colt Plus also features an automatic tailgate with an obstacle sensor. The tailgate can also be opened via the remote. The Colt Plus uses a 4A91 MIVEC engine instead of the 4G15 MIVEC one.

In March 2007, Mitsubishi launched Colt Plus in Taiwan, which is similar to the version launched in Japan in 2004 but the engine is different. It&#x27;s powered by a 1.6-litre SOHC 4G18 engine and it&#x27;s the same engine used in the 2000 Taiwanese Lancer, running slightly increased horsepower figures ( at 6,000 rpm / 14.9 kg-m at 4,500 rpm) and it uses the INVECS-III CVT transmission in fully-automatic mode. In 2008 it added a sporty version for the Taiwan market called &quot;Colt Plus iO&quot; which used the INVECS-III with 6-speed shift and changed the facelift to fit the styling in Japan. The Taiwanese model later received a facelift changing most of its body panels, while the Colts in other markets are replaced by the Mitsubishi Mirage.

The Colt Plus Turbo has the same feature as the Colt Plus except for the difference in engine and transmission. They use the same 4G15 engine as the 2004 European CZT with an output of 143 bhp but with 180 nm of torque. The Colt Plus Turbo also uses the Invecs III with a 6-speed sport shift.

The Colt Plus Ralliart is basically a 2006 facelifted version of the Colt Plus Turbo. The 4G15 engine power has been uprated to to match the Colt Version R. The styling of the Colt Plus Ralliart also matches the Colt Version R with the same EVO-inspired bonnet vents and bumpers. It is also accompanied with leather seats.

=== Facelift (2008)===
Colts built in the Netherlands received a facelift in 2008. The Japanese-built Colt has had the facelift in October 2009. The facelifted Colts featured revised interiors (including a new stereo, air conditioning dials, instrument cluster and other various parts). However, the 1.5 L OM639 diesel was removed from the range, with lack of demand cited.

=== Engines ===


=== Colt Plus facelifts (Taiwan only)===

In 2013, China Motor Corporation (CMC), as the dealer of Mitsubishi cars of Taiwan conducted a major facelift on the Colt Plus. This is the second facelift of the current generation Colt Plus, and also the biggest facelift, with every single body panel redesigned and upgrading the wheels from 4 bolt wheels to 5 bolt wheels. The facelifted Colt Plus remains on sale in Taiwan alongside other long-serving Mitsubishi models like the Grand Lancer (Lancer EX), an updated version as the next generation of the 2007 international model and an updated version of the third generation Delica. A new Colt Plus X-Sports with extra exterior plastic cladding is also exclusively available in Taiwan.

In June 2017, CMC launched the third facelift for the current generation Colt Plus, and included the Dynamic Shield design featured on various late Mitsubishi products including the Outlander, Eclipse Cross, and Grand Lancer.

<text>Johan Norberg (; born 1973) is a Swedish author and historian of ideas, devoted to promoting economic globalization and what he describes as classical liberal positions. He is the author of &quot;In Defense of Global Capitalism&quot; (2001), &quot;&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Capitalist Manifesto: Why the Global Free Market Will Save the World&quot; (2023). Since 15 March 2007, he has been a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, and since January 2017 an executive editor at Free To Choose Media, where he regularly produces documentaries for US public television.

== Early life and education ==

Johan Norberg was born in Stockholm, the son of former Swedish National Archivist Erik Norberg and his wife Birgitta. He grew up in the suburb of Hässelby in western Stockholm. In his youth, Norberg was active as an &quot;anti-industrial anarchist&quot; during high school, but later abandoned those views and became a classical liberal. According to the biography given on his personal website, Norberg was disillusioned with the anarchist view of liberty when he discovered the collectivist themes in the major anarchist works and was unable to sympathize with the pre-industrial society which its anarcho-primitivism promoted. This realization made him embrace classical liberalism, which he felt &quot;took freedom seriously.&quot; He studied at Stockholm University from 1992 to 1999 and earned an M.A. with a major in the history of ideas. His other subjects included philosophy, literature and political science. During his time at Stockholm University, he was active in the libertarian network Frihetsfronten (&quot;the Liberty Front&quot;) and was the editor of its journal &quot;Nyliberalen&quot; (&quot;The Neoliberal&quot;/&quot;The Libertarian&quot;) from 1993 to 1997.

== Career ==
In 1997, Norberg was contacted by the Swedish liberal think tank Timbro, who invited him to write a book about the Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg. The book, &quot;Motståndsmannen Vilhelm Moberg&quot;, sold well and sparked much debate which allowed him to write another book, on the history of Swedish liberalism. This book, &quot;Den svenska liberalismens historia&quot;, also became a success and in 1999 Norberg joined the permanent staff of Timbro. From 1999 to 2002 he was assistant editor-in-chief of the webzine Smedjan.com. In 1999 he started the website Frihandel.nu to put forward the case for free trade and open economies.

Having participated in a number of debates against the Swedish anti-globalization movement, in May 2001 he released the book &quot;In Defense of Global Capitalism&quot; () where he assembles his arguments for globalization and free trade. In 2002 the book was selected for the Sir Antony Fisher International Memorial Award by the Atlas Economic Research Foundation and in 2003 Norberg was awarded the gold medal of the German Hayek Stiftung (an award shared with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the German economist Otmar Issing). The British Channel 4 also invited him to present the documentary film &quot;Globalisation is Good&quot; (released in 2003), which is based on his book.

From 2002 to 2005, Norberg was head of political ideas at Timbro. From 2006 to 2007 he was a Senior Fellow with the Brussels-based think tank Centre for the New Europe.

Since 15 March 2007, he has been a Senior Fellow at the Washington, D.C.–based Cato Institute. He is also a member of the international Mont Pelerin Society. In January 2017 Norberg became Executive Editor of Free To Choose Media.

In September 2020 he published the book &quot;Open: The Story of Human Progress&quot;, described by The Economist as &quot;clear, colourful and convincing&quot;.

<doc id="1119420" wikidata="Q806227" url="?curid=1119420" title="Band of Susans">
<text>Band of Susans was an American alternative rock No Wave band formed in New York City in 1986 and active until 1996. It originally consisted of Robert Poss (guitar/vocals), Susan Stenger (bass/vocals), Ron Spitzer (drums), with Susan Lyall (guitar), Susan Tallman (guitar), and Alva Rogers (vocals). The band would undergo several permutations over the years, usually involving three guitarists. Poss, Stenger, and Spitzer were the band&#x27;s core members throughout its duration. They originated in the New York No Wave noise rock scene, but due to their layered guitar sound were sometimes seen as the American counterparts to the UK shoegazing bands. Like Sonic Youth, they drew influence from noise music experimental composers for the electric guitar Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca.

==History==
In the early to mid-1980s, Poss studied under the tutelage of avant-garde guitar ensemble composer Rhys Chatham, and played in the bands Tot Rocket and Western Eyes. The band was formed by avant-garde flautist Susan Stenger and guitarist Robert Poss, they took their name from the trio of Susans then in the lineup. Poss, Stenger, and Spitzer grew up together in Buffalo, New York.

Band of Susans released the 12&quot; EP &quot;Blessing And Curse&quot; on Poss&#x27;s own Trace Elements label. A record-release party (also said to be the band&#x27;s first-ever live gig) was held at NYC&#x27;s The Love Club on January 31, 1987; BoS were the opening act for a band called Das Furlines. They were soon signed to the avant-garde Blast First imprint of UK record label Mute Records.

After the release of début album &quot;Hope Against Hope&quot;, Rogers, Lyall and Tallman quit, and were replaced by Karen Haglof (guitar) and Page Hamilton (guitar). This lineup recorded the album &quot;Love Agenda&quot; and a Peel Sessions EP, which featured a cover of Gang Of Four&#x27;s &quot;I Found That Essence Rare&quot;. The two new guitarists then quit, with Hamilton quickly forming the more metal-influenced Helmet. Anne Husick (guitar) and Mark Lonergan (guitar) then joined BoS, yielding the band&#x27;s &quot;classic lineup&quot; which made three more albums, including The Word and the Flesh and one EP, all on Restless Records.

According to &quot;The Great Indie Discography&quot; compilation, &quot;...unfortunately, success is the one thing that has eluded the Band of Susans and Co. throughout their decade-plus lifespan.&quot;

==Sonic characteristics==
Band of Susans was a &quot;rock band without the rock clichés ... each instrument was given its own part, and they fitted together like building blocks to create droning, dense textures.&quot; As their history of having eight guitarists in all (and never less than three at any given time) attests, Band of Susans were a heavily guitar-centric outfit. They are generally included in New York City&#x27;s abrasive post-no wave scene which produced Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca, Live Skull, and Swans. They generally used G&amp;L brand guitars (which appear on several of the band&#x27;s album covers), Fender Jazzmasters, and Park (a budget brand made by Marshall) amplifiers. G&amp;L owner Leo Fender was a fan of the band and later befriended Poss. 

Musically, the band organised their three guitarists into providing an overwhelming wall of feedback and guitar noise layered atop more conventional song structures. Due to their focus on atmospheric textures, the band is often considered a peripheral member of the shoegaze movement, though they had a more abrasive sound closer to that of their New York contemporaries than most of the primarily-British bands of the shoegaze genre. Like shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Band of Susans were notorious for playing live at extremely high volumes in order to recreate the visceral impact of their studio albums. In an interview, guitarist Robert Poss noted the similarity between shoegaze and Band of Susan&#x27;s hypnotic soundscape, saying &quot;My Bloody Valentine have been contemporaries of ours, and we played shows with them in Europe and in the U.S. in 1989.&quot; Despite the band&#x27;s experimental leanings, Poss was a big fan of The Rolling Stones, which would later manifest in covers of the Stones&#x27; songs &quot;Child of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Paint It, Black&quot;.

==Live performances==
Band of Susans toured the U.S. and Europe sporadically. They played with bands such as Live Skull, My Bloody Valentine, Butthole Surfers, Wire, Rollins Band, Smegma, Das Furlines, and Lovely. During the band&#x27;s final U.S. and European tours, Jay Braun (who formed the Negatones shortly thereafter) filled in for Lonergan and Kelly Burns filled in for Ron Spitzer. Band of Susans also performed, with Rhys Chatham as a warmup &quot;group&quot;, at &quot;The Kitchen&quot; on 19th Street, in the early 1980s as part of a &quot;performance art&quot; piece. Afterward, they performed at CBGB, although not with their original lineup, with the exception of Susan Stenger, Robert Poss, and possibly Karen Hagloff. Forgotten drummer during the 1991 European and American support tour for the band&#x27;s release, &quot;Word and the Flesh&quot; was New Jersey–based drummer, Joseph Kochan, who performed as &quot;Joey Kaye&quot;.

==Post-breakup==
After the dissolution of the band in late 1996, Poss and Stenger performed with Bruce Gilbert of Wire as gilbertpossstenger; one album was released under this moniker. Stenger and Poss have also worked extensively with composer Phill Niblock. Poss has concentrated on production and solo work, whilst Stenger played live with Siouxsie Sioux&#x27;s second band the Creatures in 1998, and worked with Nick Cave, John Cale and Alan Vega (Suicide) among others.

<doc id="1119446" wikidata="Q1847429" url="?curid=1119446" title="MMMBop">
<text>&quot;MMMBop&quot; is a song written and performed by American pop rock band Hanson. It was released on April 15, 1997, by Mercury Records as the lead single from their first full-length studio album, &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; (1997). The song is the band&#x27;s most successful single to date and was nominated for Record of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;MMMBop&quot; was a major success worldwide, reaching number one in at least 12 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Its music video was directed by Tamra Davis.

The song was voted the best single of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, while also topping critics&#x27; polls from such media as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, and VH1, and was ranked number 20 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90s&quot;, as well as number 98 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years&quot;. In 2023, Hanson released a new version of &quot;MMMBop&quot;, entitled &quot;MMMBop 2.0&quot; in collaboration with English pop punk band Busted.

==Background and composition==
The song originally appeared on the 1996 independent album &quot;MMMBop&quot; with a slower tempo, but was reworked as an upbeat pop track by producers the Dust Brothers. This became the hit version. In an August 2004 interview with Songfacts, Zac Hanson explained the song&#x27;s origins:

&quot;MMMBop&quot; is written and composed in the key of A major.

==Critical reception==
Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;The rush of youth-driven acts on radio accelerates with the onset of this candy-coated pop confection. Try to imagine what the Jackson 5 might sound like with the accompaniment of a skittling funk beat and scratchy faux-grunge guitars, and you will have a clear picture of where Hanson is coming from. Initially it&#x27;s a mildly jarring combination, but it&#x27;s ultimately quite cool. Factor in an instantly catchy chorus, and you have the making of a runaway smash.&quot; A reviewer from Scottish &quot;Daily Record&quot; noted, &quot;They&#x27;re about half the age of the Spice Girls, but Hanson can sing, play their own instruments and string a sentence together. It must be their American upbringing.&quot; Sara Scribner from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named it &quot;a lighthearted dollop of nonsensical pop.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Music Week&quot; gave the song four out of five, stating that &quot;media attention is sky high for these three Tulsa brothers, aged 11, 14 and 16. And this cutesy, catchy pop song is the ideal debut single to cash in on that interest.&quot;

Chuck Eddy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt it &quot;sticks in your brain like Trident in your shag carpet.&quot; He explained, &quot;Built on a turntable-scratch update of the soul rhythms that served as turn-of-the-&#x27;70s bubblegum rock&#x27;s secret weapon, the song is as unintelligible as it is indelible. Its hooks suburbanize the Jackson 5 as expertly as the Osmonds used to, but whether its quivering lyrics really deal with chewing (a favorite bubble entendre since the Ohio Express&#x27; &quot;Chewy Chewy&quot;) is anybody&#x27;s guess.&quot; Ben Knowles from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; said &quot;MMMBop&quot; sounded like &quot;a one-off, tasty, unbelievably ear-tingling, perfect pop treat.&quot; Ian Hyland from &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; gave the song eight out of ten, commenting, &quot;Teenage brothers from America who sound a bit like Sheryl Crow on helium. You&#x27;ll love this at first, but in a few weeks you&#x27;ll be kicking the TV in whenever their smiley faces appear.&quot; David Sinclair from &quot;The Times&quot; concluded, &quot;No 1 in America and all over British radio like a rash, it sounds like a gilt-edged pop standard already.&quot;

&quot;MMMBop&quot; was voted the best single of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, while also topping critics&#x27; polls from such media as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, and VH1, and was ranked number 20 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90s&quot;, as well as number 98 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it as the ninth-best boy band song of all time.

==Chart performance==
On the chart dated May 3, 1997, &quot;MMMBop&quot; debuted at number 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On the chart dated May 10, 1997, the song rose to No. 6. It continued to rise the next week, reaching No. 2. On the chart dated May 24, 1997, the song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, staying there for three weeks before falling to No. 2.

==Music video==
A music video was produced to promote the single, directed by American film, television and music video director Tamra Davis. It features the Hanson brothers singing and playing their instruments in a suburban living room. In between, there are clips of them entering a cave, ending up on a beach. Other scenes show them playing around in a city, dancing on the Moon, driving a car or appearing in old footage of Albert Einstein.

==Notable cover versions==
Twenty years after the first recording of &quot;MMMBop&quot;, approximately 93,000 cover versions of the song were counted by MTV reporter Patrick Hosken in March 2016, as represented on YouTube. The Hansons told Rebecca Milzoff at &quot;Vulture&quot; that they had not heard any good cover versions, because &quot;People can&#x27;t sing the chorus right. Most of the time they syncopate it wrong,&quot; according to Isaac Hanson. Later that year, Postmodern Jukebox recorded a cover in the style of 1950s swinging doo-wop with four male singers; picking up 1.5 million views on YouTube in the first year. In July 2019, the official Hanson Twitter feed shared a video by Scary Pockets, a band founded by keyboardist Jack Conte. The Scary Pockets version was fronted by Lucy Schwartz on lead vocals, and Adam Neely covered the electric bass.

In 2023, English band Busted released a cover version of the song, in collaboration with Hanson. The new version, &quot;MMMBop 2.0&quot;, was released as a single worldwide on May 26, 2023. It peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Sales Chart.

<doc id="1119461" wikidata="Q943321" url="?curid=1119461" title="Henry T. Rainey">
<text>Henry Thomas Rainey (August 20, 1860 – August 19, 1934) was an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party from Illinois, he served in the United States House of Representatives from 1903 to 1921 and from 1923 to his death in 1934. He rose to Speaker of the House, during the famous Hundred days of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Rainey attended the public schools and Knox Academy and Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois. He transferred to, and graduated from Amherst College in 1883 and then the Northwestern University School of Law, in Chicago which he graduated in 1885. He was admitted to the bar in 1885 and commenced practice in Carrollton, Illinois.

===Political career===
Rainey was appointed master in chancery for Greene County, Illinois, from 1887 until 1895, when he resigned, and returned to private practice. He then decided to return to politics in 1902 getting elected to Congress and serving for nine terms before losing to Guy L. Shaw in 1920. Two years later, he won back his seat and served until his death. The 1903 Congressional Directory notes that Rainey &quot;belongs to the Knights of Pythias, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Modern Woodmen, the Mutual Protective League, and the Elks.&quot;

===Leadership===
Due to the Great Depression, the Republican party lost its majority in a landslide, and, with John Nance Garner elevated to the Speakership, Rainey ran for, and defeated John McDuffie for the Majority leadership. McDuffie remained as Whip.

===Speaker of the House===
 With Speaker Garner having been inaugurated Vice President on March 4, 1933, Rainey, being next in line, was elected Speaker of the House when President Roosevelt called a special session of Congress two days later. Rainey gave the Roosevelt administration carte blanche to do whatever it wanted, allowing almost the entire New Deal to be passed with little or no changes.

More reforms were passed during the regular session starting December. Rainey died of a heart attack the following summer, on the eve of his seventy-fourth birthday, before the new Congress could meet.

<text>The first USS &quot;Kalk&quot; (DD–170) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Hamilton&quot; (I24) and then into the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS &quot;Hamilton&quot; (I24).

==Construction and career==

===United States Navy===

Named for Stanton Frederick Kalk, &quot;Kalk&quot;, laid down as &quot;Rodgers&quot; 17 August 1918. The ship was launched on 21 December 1918, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. Flora Stanton Kalk, mother of Lieutenant Kalk. &quot;Rodgers&quot; was renamed &quot;Kalk&quot; on 23 December 1918 and commissioned at Boston on 29 March 1919.

After shakedown off Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Kalk&quot; departed Boston on 3 May for Newfoundland. Arriving at Trespassey on 5 May, she sailed 3 days later for the mid-Atlantic to provide rescue cover during the pioneer flight of the United States Navy seaplane NC-4 from Newfoundland to the Azores on 16 to 17 May. After returning to Boston on 20 May, she sailed for Europe on 10 July, arriving at Brest, France, 21 July. Proceeding via England to Hamburg, Germany, she arrived on 27 July to begin a 3-week cruise through the Baltic Sea, visiting Baltic and Scandinavian countries on American Relief Administration operations. She returned to Brest on 23 August to serve as a dispatch and escort ship until departing for the United States 25 January 1920.

Arriving at Boston on 12 February, she trained reserves of the 1st Naval District and operated with DesRon 3 along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Cod to Charleston, South Carolina. As a result of the Five Power Naval Treaty, which was signed at the Washington Conference 6 February 1922, &quot;Kalk&quot; departed Boston 10 May for Philadelphia, where she decommissioned on 10 July and was placed in reserve.

When war in Europe threatened the security of the entire world, &quot;Kalk&quot; was recommissioned on 17 June 1940. The ship departed Philadelphia on 26 July, arriving at Charleston on 31 July for duty with the Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic. &quot;Kalk&quot; was one of 50 overage destroyers turned over to Britain in exchange for strategic bases in the Atlantic under terms of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement of 2 September. She cleared Charleston on 7 September and steamed via Hampton Roads and Newport to Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving on 18 September. &quot;Kalk&quot; decommissioned on 23 September and was turned over to the British the same day.

===Royal Navy===

Commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Hamilton&quot;, which was a placename common to both the UK and US. The 2 November 1940, issue of The Royal Gazette, the newspaper published in the City of Hamilton in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, reported this in an article titled &quot;&quot;NEW&quot; DESTROYER HAS NAME OF HAMILTON: Mayor Here Receives Letter From Her Commander&quot;, and began:

(The article went on to mention that the Mayor was to open a fund to supply the crew of the ship with newspapers and included the text of Shadwell&#x27;s letter).

She collided with (formerly the US destroyer &quot;Maddox&quot;) at St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador on 1 October while en route to England. Proceeding to Saint John, New Brunswick, for repairs, she went aground and suffered extensive damage. Because of a British manpower shortage, she was manned by Canadians during and after repair operations. &quot;Hamilton&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4&quot;/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog anti-submarine weapon.

===Royal Canadian Navy===
Late in June 1941 she commissioned in the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS &quot;Hamilton&quot; fitting within the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers—the Hamilton River of Labrador.

Throughout her active service, she remained in North American waters, protecting convoys from St. John&#x27;s to New York. On 2 August 1942, she sighted and attacked a German U-boat and, by forcing it to submerge, prevented an attack on the convoy. Declared unfit for operations 11 August 1943, she became a tender to at Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Declared surplus 1 April 1945, she decommissioned 8 June at Sydney, Nova Scotia. &quot;Hamilton&quot; departed Sydney 6 July under tow for Baltimore, Maryland, where she was sold for scrapping by the Boston Iron &amp; Metal Company, but was lost while being towed to Baltimore.

<doc id="1119469" wikidata="Q176098" url="?curid=1119469" title="All You Need Is Love">
<text>&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in July 1967, with &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot; as its B-side. It was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was Britain&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Our World&quot;, the first live global television link, for which the band were shown performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries. Lennon&#x27;s lyrics were deliberately simplistic, to allow for broad appeal to the show&#x27;s international audience, and captured the utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States and many other countries, and became an anthem for the counterculture&#x27;s embrace of flower power philosophy.

&quot;Our World&quot; coincided with the height of the Beatles&#x27; popularity and influence, following the release of their album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Rather than perform the song entirely live, the group played to a pre-recorded backing track. With an orchestral arrangement by George Martin, the song begins with a portion of the French national anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and ends with musical quotations from works such as Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot;, &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, Bach&#x27;s Invention No. 8 in F major, and the Beatles&#x27; 1963 hit &quot;She Loves You&quot;. Adding to the broadcast&#x27;s festive atmosphere, the studio was adorned with signs and streamers and filled with guests dressed in psychedelic attire, including members of the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Small Faces. Brian Epstein, the Beatles&#x27; manager, described the performance as the band&#x27;s &quot;finest&quot; moment.

&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, and its B-side, &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot;, were later included on the US &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; album and served as the two morals for the Beatles&#x27; 1968 animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Originally broadcast in black-and-white, the &quot;Our World&quot; performance was colourised for inclusion in the Beatles&#x27; 1995 &quot;Anthology&quot; documentary series. While the song remains synonymous with the 1967 Summer of Love ethos and provided the foundation for Lennon&#x27;s legacy as a humanitarian, numerous critics found the message naïve in retrospect, particularly during the 1980s. Since 2009, Global Beatles Day, an international celebration of the Beatles&#x27; music and social message, takes place on 25 June each year in tribute to their &quot;Our World&quot; performance.

==Background and inspiration==

On 18 May 1967, the Beatles signed a contract to appear as Britain&#x27;s representatives on &quot;Our World&quot;, which was to be broadcast live internationally, via satellite, on 25 June. The Beatles were asked to provide a song with a message that could be easily understood by everyone, and using &quot;basic English&quot; terms. The band undertook the assignment at a time when they were considering making a television special, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, and working on songs for the animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, for which they were contractually obliged to United Artists to supply four new recordings. &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was selected for &quot;Our World&quot; for its contemporary social significance over the Paul McCartney-written &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;. In a statement to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine, Brian Epstein, the band&#x27;s manager, said of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;: &quot;It was an inspired song and they really wanted to give the world a message. The nice thing about it is that it cannot be misinterpreted. It is a clear message saying that love is everything.&quot;

John Lennon later attributed the song&#x27;s simple lyrical statements to his liking of slogans and television advertising. He likened the song to a propaganda piece, adding: &quot;I&#x27;m a revolutionary artist. My art is dedicated to change.&quot; Author Mark Hertsgaard views it as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;most political song yet&quot; up to 1967 and the origins of Lennon&#x27;s posthumous standing as a &quot;humanitarian hero&quot;. The song&#x27;s advocacy of the all-importance of love followed Lennon&#x27;s introduction of the idea in his lyrics to &quot;The Word&quot; in 1965 and George Harrison&#x27;s declaration in &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, from the band&#x27;s recently released &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album, that &quot;With our love, we could save the world&quot;.

The Beatles were unimpressed when Epstein first told them that he had arranged for their appearance on &quot;Our World&quot;, and they delayed choosing a song for the broadcast. In their interviews for &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; in the 1990s, McCartney and Harrison say they were unsure whether &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was written for &quot;Our World&quot;, while Ringo Starr and George Martin, the Beatles&#x27; producer, state that it was. McCartney said: &quot;It was certainly tailored to [the broadcast] once we had it. But I&#x27;ve got a feeling it was just one of John&#x27;s songs that was coming anyway.&quot; In McCartney&#x27;s recollection, the song was entirely Lennon&#x27;s, with Harrison, Starr and his own contributions confined to &quot;ad-libs&quot; at the end of the recording.

==Composition and musical structure==
===Main portion===

&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; contains an asymmetric time signature and complex changes. Musicologist Russell Reising writes that, although the song represents the peak of the Beatles&#x27; overtly psychedelic phase, the change in metre during the verses is the sole example of the experimental aspect that typifies the band&#x27;s work in that genre. The main verse pattern contains a total of 29 beats, split into two  measures, a single bar of , followed by a one bar return of before repeating the pattern. The chorus, however, maintains a steady beat with the exception of the last bar of  (on the lyric &quot;love is all you need&quot;). The prominent cello line draws attention to this departure from pop-single normality, although it was not the first time that the Beatles had experimented with varied metre within a single song: &quot;Love You To&quot; and &quot;She Said She Said&quot; were earlier examples.

The song is in the key of G and the verse opens (on &quot;There&#x27;s nothing you can do&quot;) with a G chord and D melody note, the chords shifting in a I–V–vi chord progression while the bass simultaneously moves from the tonic (G) note to the root note of the relative minor (E minor), via an F, supporting a first inversion D chord. After the verse &quot;learn how to play the game, it&#x27;s easy&quot;, the bass alters the prolonged V (D) chord with F, E, C and B notes. The song includes a dramatic use of a dominant or V chord (here D) on &quot;It&#x27;s easy.&quot; The &quot;Love, love, love&quot; chant involves chords in a I–V7–vi shift (G–D–Em) and simultaneous descending B, A, G notes with the concluding G note corresponding not to the tonic G chord, but acting as the third of the E minor chord; this also introducing the E note of the Em chord as a 6th of the tonic G scale. Supporting the same melody note with different and unexpected chords has been termed a characteristic Beatles technique.

According to Reising, the lyrics advance the Beatles&#x27; anti-materialistic message and are an &quot;anthemic tribute&quot; to universal love in which &quot;nothing is tempered or modulated&quot;. He says that Lennon favours words such as &quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;no one&quot;, &quot;nowhere&quot; and &quot;all&quot;, thereby presenting a series of &quot;extreme statements&quot; that conclude with &quot;the final reversals of &#x27;All you need is love&#x27; and &#x27;Love is all you need&#x27;&quot;.

===Quotations and coda===
On the Beatles&#x27; recording, the song starts with the first few bars of the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, and contains elements from other musical works, such as Glenn Miller&#x27;s 1939 hit &quot;In the Mood&quot;. This use of musical quotations follows an approach first adopted by the Beatles in Harrison&#x27;s composition &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot;, which similarly reflects the ideology behind the hippie movement during the 1967 Summer of Love. George Martin recalled that in &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; &quot;the boys ... wanted to freak out at the end, and just go mad&quot;. During the long coda, elements of other musical works can be heard, including &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, Invention No. 8 in F major (BWV 779) by J. S. Bach, &quot;In the Mood&quot;, &quot;Prince of Denmark&#x27;s March&quot;, and the Beatles&#x27; own songs &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&quot;. The first of these three pieces had been included in the arrangement by Martin, while &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&quot; were the result of improvisation by Lennon during rehearsals.

Like musicologist Alan Pollack, Kenneth Womack views the &quot;She Loves You&quot; refrain as serving a similar purpose to the wax models of the Beatles depicted on the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, beside the real-life band members, and therefore a further example of the group distancing themselves from their past. In his book &quot;Rock, Counterculture and the Avant-Garde&quot;, author Doyle Greene describes the combination of the &quot;Love is all you need&quot; refrain, &quot;She Loves You&quot; reprise, and orchestral quotations from Bach and Miller as &quot;a joyous, collective anarchy signifying the utopian dreams of the counterculture topped off with a postmodern fanfare&quot;.

==Recording==
===Backing track===

The Beatles began recording the backing track for the song at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes, South-West London, on 14 June 1967. The producers of &quot;Our World&quot; were initially unhappy about the use of a backing track for the broadcast, but Martin insisted, saying, &quot;we can&#x27;t just go in front of 350 million people without some work&quot;. The initial line-up was Lennon on harpsichord, McCartney on double bass with a bow, Harrison on violin – three instruments that were unfamiliar to the musicians – while Starr played drums. The band recorded 33 takes, before choosing the tenth take as the best. This performance was transferred onto a new 4-track tape, with the four instruments mixed into one track. The engineers at Olympic thought the Beatles displayed a surprising lack of care during this process, a sign, according to author Ian MacDonald, of the group&#x27;s new preference for randomness in contrast to the high production standards of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.

From 19 June, working at Studio 2 in EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios), the Beatles recorded overdubs including piano (played by Martin), banjo, guitar and some vocal parts. Among the latter were the &quot;Love, love, love&quot; refrains, and a Lennon vocal over the song&#x27;s choruses. On 23 June, the band began rehearsing the song with an orchestra, whose playing was also added to the backing track. On 24 June, the day before the broadcast, the Beatles decided that the song would be their next single. Late that morning, a press call was held at EMI Studios, attended by over 100 journalists and photographers, followed by further rehearsals and recording. Publicity photos were taken during the press call and rehearsals, and a BBC television crew blocked the camera angles required for the live performance. As part of this pre-broadcast promotion, the Beatles posed in a yard beside the studio building, wearing boards that together spelt out &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; and approximations of the song title in three other languages.

===Live broadcast===

The &quot;Our World&quot; broadcast took place in the wake of the Arab–Israeli Six-Day War and, for the Beatles, amid the public furore caused by McCartney&#x27;s admission that he had taken LSD. On 25 June, the live transmission cut to EMI Studios at 8:54 pm London time, about 40 seconds earlier than expected. Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick were drinking scotch whisky to calm their nerves for the task of mixing the audio for a live worldwide broadcast, and had to scramble to hide the bottle and glasses beneath the mixing desk after being told they were about to go on air.&lt;ref name=&quot;Badman/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;Badman, Keith. &quot;Universal Love&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beatles (except for Starr, behind his drum kit) were seated on high stools, accompanied by a thirteen-piece orchestra. The band were surrounded by friends and acquaintances seated on the floor, who sang along with the refrain during the fade-out. These guests included Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Keith Moon, Graham Nash, and Pattie Boyd (Harrison&#x27;s wife), along with Mike McGear and Jane Asher (McCartney&#x27;s brother and girlfriend, respectively). The studio setting was designed to reflect the communal aspect of the occasion while also demonstrating the position of influence that the Beatles held among their peers, particularly following the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Many of the invitations were extended through Beatles aides Mal Evans and Tony Bramwell, who had visited various London nightclubs the night before the broadcast.
Also among the studio audience were members of the Small Faces and the design collective the Fool. Balloons, flowers, streamers and &quot;Love&quot; graffiti added to the celebratory atmosphere. The Beatles and their entourage were dressed in psychedelic clothes and scarves; in his report on the performance, Barry Miles likened the setting to a medieval gathering, broken only by the presence of modern studio equipment such as large headphones and microphones. According to Michael Frontani, an associate professor of communications, whereas &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; showed the Beatles as artists and &quot;serious musicians&quot;, &quot;Our World&quot; emphasised their identity as members of the hippie counterculture.

The segment was directed by Derek Burrell-Davis, the head of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Our World&quot; project. It opened with the band playing &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; for about a minute, before Martin, speaking from the studio control room, suggested that the orchestra should take their places for the recording as the tape was rewound. The BBC presenter, Steve Race, announced that the Beatles had just recorded this performance and were about to complete the recording live. In fact, in author John Winn&#x27;s description, Race&#x27;s statements were part of the &quot;staged&quot; aspect of the segment, which purported to show the Beatles at work in the studio: the opening footage of the band (merely rehearsing over the backing track) had been filmed earlier, and by the time Martin appeared to be issuing instructions, the orchestra were already seated in Studio 1. The Beatles, accompanied by the orchestra and the studio guests, then performed the entire song, overdubbing onto the pre-recorded rhythm track. In addition to the lead and backing vocals and the orchestra, the live elements were McCartney&#x27;s bass guitar part, Harrison&#x27;s guitar solo and Starr&#x27;s drums. In the opinion of music critic Richie Unterberger, the performance of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; is &quot;the best footage of the Beatles in the psychedelic period&quot; and &quot;captures Flower Power at its zenith, with enough irreverence to avoid pomposity, what with the sandwich boards of lyrics, the florid clothing and decor, and celebrity guests&quot;.

===Final overdubs===

Lennon, affecting indifference, was said to be nervous about the broadcast, given the potential size of the international TV audience. Later on 25 June, dissatisfied with his singing, he re-recorded the solo verses for use on the single. On 26 June, in EMI&#x27;s Studio 2, Lennon&#x27;s vocal was treated with ADT, and Starr overdubbed a drum roll at the start of the track, replacing a tambourine part.

The programme was shown in black-and-white since colour television had yet to commence broadcasting in Britain and most of the world. The Beatles&#x27; footage was colourised, based on photographs of the event, for the 1995 documentary &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;. Over the documentary&#x27;s end credits, a snippet of studio conversation from the 25 June overdubbing session includes Lennon telling Martin: &quot;I&#x27;m ready to sing for the world, George, if you can just give me the backing …&quot; The colour version of the band&#x27;s &quot;Our World&quot; appearance also appears on the Beatles&#x27; 2015 video compilation &quot;1&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was issued in the UK on 7 July 1967, on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label, with &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot; as the B-side. The US release, on Capitol Records, took place on 17 July. In his contemporary review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Nick Jones said the Beatles represented the &quot;progressive avant-garde&quot; in their approach to singles releases, and that &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was &quot;another milestone in their very phenomenal career&quot;. He described the song as a &quot;cool, calculated contagious Beatles singsong&quot; that was more immediate than &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, and concluded: &quot;The message is &#x27;love&#x27; and I hope everyone in the whole wide world manages to get it.&quot; The single entered the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart (subsequently the UK Singles Chart) at number 2 before topping the listings for three weeks. In the US, it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for a week. The song was a number 1 hit in many other countries. It was also the subject of a copyright dispute between EMI and KPM, the publisher of &quot;In the Mood&quot;, later in July. Since Martin had not checked the copyright status of Miller&#x27;s piece before incorporating it into the coda, EMI were obliged to pay royalties to KPM. On 11 September, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.
The single coincided with the height of the Beatles&#x27; popularity and influence during the 1960s, following the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. In his retrospective feature on the song in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Gavin Edwards writes that &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; provided &quot;the sing-song anthem for the Summer of Love, with a sentiment that was simple but profound&quot;. According to historian David Simonelli, such was the band&#x27;s international influence, it was the song that formally announced the arrival of flower power ideology as a mainstream concept. The Beatles followed up the utopian spirit of &quot;Our World&quot; in their activities over July and August, during their first summer free of tour commitments. In late July, the band investigated the possibility of buying a Greek island with a view to setting up a hippie-style commune for themselves and members of their inner circle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt/Island&quot;&gt;Hunt, Chris. &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt; After sailing around the Aegean Sea and approving a location on the island of Leslo, the Beatles decided against the idea and returned to London. In early August, Harrison and a small entourage made a well-publicised visit to the international hippie capital of Haight-Ashbury, in San Francisco.

Writing in 2001, Peter Doggett said that the Beatles&#x27; performance on &quot;Our World&quot; &quot;remains one of the strongest visual impressions of the summer of love&quot;; Womack describes it as &quot;flower power&#x27;s finest moment&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranks &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; 370th on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; and 21st on its &quot;100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot; list. &quot;Mojo&quot; placed it at number 28 on a similar list of the best Beatles songs. In his commentary for the magazine, producer and musician Dave Stewart admired the track&#x27;s &quot;jumbled-up mix of music – marching band and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; and recalled the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Our World&quot; appearance as &quot;a signal for those [of us] who felt we were trapped in a mental hospital in some suburban town to break out&quot;. In 2018, the music staff of &quot;Time Out London&quot; ranked &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; at number 4 on their list of the best Beatles songs.

In November 1967, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was included on the American LP version of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, together with the band&#x27;s other singles tracks from that year. It was also included on the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; soundtrack album, released in January 1969. As a statement on the power of universal love, the song served as the moral in the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; film; it plays over a scene where Lennon&#x27;s character defeats the Blue Meanies by throwing the word &quot;Love&quot; at their evil Flying Glove. The song is also featured in Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s show &quot;Love&quot;, based on the songs of the Beatles. It was sequenced as the closing track of the 2006 soundtrack album.

==Cultural responses and legacy==

===Social relevance===


In a 1981 article on the musical and social developments of 1967, sociomusicologist Simon Frith described &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; as a &quot;genuinely moving song&quot; and said that, further to the impact of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, the international broadcast confirmed &quot;the Beatles&#x27; evangelical role&quot; in a year when &quot;it seemed the whole world was waiting for something new, and the power of music was beyond doubt.&quot; Psychiatrist and New Left advocate R. D. Laing wrote about the song&#x27;s contemporary appeal:
The times fitted [the Beatles] like a glove. Everyone was getting the feel of the world as a global village – as us, one species. The whole human race was becoming unified under the shadow of death ... One of the most heartening things about the Beatles was that they gave expression to a shared sense of celebration around the world, a sense of the same sensibility.

Doyle Greene writes that because of its presentation as the conclusion to &quot;Our World&quot;, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; provided &quot;a distinctly political statement&quot;. He says that the song was &quot;selling peace&quot; on a programme that aimed to foster international understanding in a climate of Cold War hostility, the Vietnam War and revolutionary unrest in the Third World. By contrast, &quot;NME&quot; critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler detected self-parody in the song, saying that the Beatles sought to debunk their elevated status during the Summer of Love.

According to author Jon Wiener, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; served as &quot;the anthem of flower power&quot; that summer but also, like &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, highlighted the ideological gulf between the predominantly white hippie movement and the increasingly political ghetto culture in the US. Wiener says that the song&#x27;s pacifist agenda infuriated many student radicals from the New Left and that these detractors &quot;continued to denounce [Lennon] for it for the rest of his life&quot;. He also writes that, in summer 1967, &quot;links between the counterculture and the New Left remained murky&quot;, since a full dialogue regarding politics and rock music was still a year away and would only be inspired by Lennon&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;Revolution&quot;.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1967 single &quot;We Love You&quot; was inspired by the message of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, and John Lennon and Paul McCartney appeared on the song, contributing backing vocals.

In the mid-1970s, according to Carr and Tyler, it was still &quot;impossible&quot; to hear the start of the French national anthem without launching into &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, yet even a contrite &quot;reformed hippie&quot; could &quot;bellow tunelessly along with this glorious, irreverent single &quot;without any real embarrassment&quot; – a measure of its internal strength and durability&quot;.

In 2005, a handwritten copy of the lyrics sold at auction for $1.25 million (equivalent to $ million in ), more than tripling the record for a lyric manuscript previously held by Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;.
===Retrospective criticism===
In the decades following the record&#x27;s release, Beatles biographers and music journalists criticised the lyrics as naive and simplistic and detected a smugness in the message; the song&#x27;s musical content was similarly dismissed as unimaginative. Ian MacDonald viewed it as &quot;one of The Beatles&#x27; less deserving hits&quot; and, in its apparently chaotic production, typical of the band&#x27;s self-indulgent work immediately after &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Regarding the song&#x27;s message, MacDonald writes:
During the materialistic Eighties, this song&#x27;s title was the butt of cynics, there being, obviously, any number of additional things needed to sustain life on earth. It should, perhaps, be pointed out that this record was not conceived as a blueprint for a successful career. &quot;All you need is love&quot; is a transcendental statement, as true on its level as the principle of investment on the level of the stock exchange. In the idealistic perspective of 1967 – the polar opposite of 1987 – its title makes perfect sense.
Writing in 1988, author and critic Tim Riley identified the track&#x27;s &quot;internal contradictions (positivisms expressed with negatives)&quot; and &quot;bloated self-confidence (&#x27;it&#x27;s easy&#x27;)&quot; as qualities that rendered it as &quot;the naive answer to &#x27;A Day in the Life&#x27;&quot;. By contrast, Mark Hertsgaard considers &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; to be among the Beatles&#x27; finest songs and one of the few highlights among their recordings from the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;–&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; era. In his opinion, Lennon&#x27;s detractors fail to discern between &quot;shallow and utopian&quot; when ridiculing the song as socially irrelevant, and he adds: &quot;one may as well complain that Martin Luther King was a poor singer as criticize Lennon on fine points of political strategy; his role was the Poet, not the Political Organizer.&quot;

Writing in 2017, Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; said that the song &quot;appears hopelessly naïve 50 years on&quot; yet its espousal of global connectedness had become increasingly relevant. In his view, through &quot;Our World&quot;, &quot;&#x27;All You Need Is Love&#x27; marked a new chapter in the world&#x27;s colonisation by telecommunications&quot;, and its message inspired the sentiments behind &quot;Love Trumps Hate&quot;, displayed on placards protesting Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 US presidential win, and the One Love Manchester benefit concert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter-Tilney/FT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity of message===
In Granada Television&#x27;s 1987 documentary &quot;It Was Twenty Years Ago Today&quot;, commemorating two decades since &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and the Summer of Love, several of the interviewees were asked whether they still believed that &quot;Love is all you need&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrington/WashPost&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison was the only one who unequivocally agreed with the sentiment. Asked why this was, he told Mark Ellen of &quot;Q&quot; magazine: &quot;They all said &#x27;All You Need Is Love&#x27; but you also need such-and-such else. But … love is complete knowledge. If we all had total knowledge, then we would have complete love and, on that basis, everything is taken care of. It&#x27;s a law of nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellen/Q&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, George Vaillant, the chief investigator of the Grant Study, which tracked 268 Harvard undergraduates for a period of 80 years with the goal of finding what factors led to longevity, said that happiness had a strong correlation to close relationships, summarising: &quot;Happiness is love. Full stop.&quot; The CBC reported that the &quot;[Grant] study proves Beatles right: All You Need is Love.&quot;

===In popular culture===

* During the Yes campaign of the Pablo Picasso purchase referendum of 1967, the slogan &quot;All we need is Pablo&quot; was used in reference to the song.
*In February 1968, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was played in the &quot;Fall Out&quot; episode of the TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, directed by Patrick McGoohan. It was a rare example of the Beatles licensing their music for use in another artist&#x27;s film or television project.
* Tony Palmer titled his 17-part television series &quot;All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music&quot; after the Beatles song. The series, which first aired in 1977, included an episode (&quot;Mighty Good&quot;) dedicated to the band.
* In 1978, the Rutles parodied &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; in their song &quot;Love Life&quot; on their album &quot;The Rutles&quot; and titled their television film satirising the Beatles&#x27; history &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;. According to &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Marc Spitz, writing in 2013, this title was &quot;really an attack&quot; on the commercialisation of rock music by the late 1970s.
* Harrison showed his enduring admiration for the song by referencing the song&#x27;s name in his 1981 tribute to Lennon, &quot;All Those Years Ago&quot;, which appears on the album &quot;Somewhere in England&quot;.
* Bob Geldof said he wrote the 1984 Band Aid charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; out of a wish to create &quot;something that could be sung all around the world, like &#x27;All You Need Is Love&#x27;&quot;. He also credited the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Our World&quot; performance as part of his inspiration for staging Live Aid in 1985.
* At Live Aid on 13 July 1985, Elvis Costello performed &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; before a television audience estimated at up to 1.9 billion. Costello introduced it as an &quot;old Northern English folk song&quot; and sang with a &quot;vitriolic snarl&quot;, in Riley&#x27;s description, that suggested &quot;how far there still was to go rather than how far we&#x27;d come&quot; in terms of realising the song&#x27;s message.
* The song is mentioned by its name in the 1996 science fiction film &quot;Independence Day&quot; by Julius Levinson, played by Judd Hirsch.
* &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was part of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s entrance music at the official millennium celebrations on 31 December 1999. The Beatles&#x27; recording was played just before the midnight festivities at the Millennium Dome in London. In 2002, the song was performed by choirs across Britain during the queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* A cover version of the song was used in a 2007 advertisement for Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Luvs baby product brand.
* In 2009, Global Beatles Day was founded as an international celebration of the Beatles&#x27; music and social message.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBD/IndianExpress&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The event takes place on 25 June each year in memory of the &quot;Our World&quot; performance of the song.
*In October 2021, American singer Katy Perry released a cover of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; for a Gap holiday advertisement.

<text>Melvin Leroy Harder (October 15, 1909 – October 20, 2002), nicknamed &quot;Chief&quot;, was an American right-handed starting pitcher, coach and manager in Major League Baseball, who played his entire career with the Cleveland Indians. He spent 36 seasons overall with the Indians, as a player from 1928 to 1947 and as one of the game&#x27;s most highly regarded pitching coaches from 1948 to 1963. He set franchise records for wins (223), games started (433) and innings pitched (3426) which were later broken by Bob Feller, and he still holds the club record of 582 career games pitched. He was among the American League&#x27;s career leaders in wins (9th), games (8th) and starts (10th) when he retired. He was also an excellent fielder, leading AL pitchers in putouts four times, then a record.

==Career==
Harder was born in Beemer, Nebraska, and graduated from Tech High School in North Omaha, Nebraska. He broke in with the Indians as a relief pitcher in 1928. His pitching style revolved around his fine curveball, a hard fastball and excellent control. He joined the starting rotation in 1930, and posted a record of 39–37 from 1930 to 1932; on July 31, 1932, he pitched the first game ever at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. In 1933 he finished second in the AL with an earned run average of 2.95, trailing teammate Monte Pearson (2.33); under modern rules (one inning pitched per games played by team), enacted in 1951, Harder would have been credited with the league lead, as Pearson only pitched 135 innings. In 1934 he finished with 20 wins, led the league with six shutouts, and was again second in ERA (2.61) to Lefty Gómez. In 1935 he was second to Wes Ferrell in wins (22) and innings (287), and was fifth in the AL with a 3.29 ERA. After developing a sore elbow and bursitis in his shoulder, he won at least 15 games each season from 1936 to 1939; he led AL pitchers in putouts in 1932, 1933, 1935 and 1938.

Harder was one of the most successful All-Stars of the 1930s, appearing in all four games from 1934 to 1937, and setting a record with 13 consecutive innings without an earned run. He won the 1934 All-Star game after relieving Red Ruffing with none out and two men on in the fifth inning, with an 8–6 lead; one run scored on a double steal, but Harder allowed only one hit in his five innings as the AL won 9–7. He earned a save in the 1935 game, pitching three scoreless innings to finish a 4–1 victory, and another in 1937 with three shutout innings in the 8–3 win; he also finished the 4–3 loss played at Cleveland in 1936 with two innings.

In 1940, he posted a 12–11 record, as the Indians finished one game behind the pennant-winning Detroit Tigers, wasting an early September lead amid clubhouse rancor; it would be the only season in his career in which the Indians came within ten games of the AL flag. After several more years in which his record hovered near .500, earning his 200th victory in 1944, Harder ended his career in 1947 with 1160 strikeouts and a 3.80 ERA. In addition to his 223 victories, his 186 losses remain a club record. Ironically, the Indians won the World Series the year after he retired.

From 1948 into the 1950s, he guided what became known as the Indians&#x27; &quot;Big Four&quot; pitching rotation, featuring Feller, Bob Lemon, Early Wynn and Mike Garcia; Harder had successfully transformed Lemon from an infielder into a top pitcher while working with him in the mid-1940s, and he taught future 300 game-winner Wynn the breaking ball and changeup. Wynn had had a losing record (72-87) before being traded to the Indians by the Washington Senators. In 1953, Lemon tied Harder&#x27;s record by leading AL pitchers in putouts for the fourth time, and he broke the record the following year as the Indians won another pennant, but lost to the underdog New York Giants in the World Series. Herb Score was named the AL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year in 1955 after Harder helped to develop his curveball. When Sal Maglie was struggling with the Indians, Harder watched some films of Maglie pitching with the Giants and figured out that he wasn&#x27;t swivelling his foot like he normally did, which kept him from following through with his delivery. &quot;As soon as I went back to the old way, everything was all right,&quot; Maglie said. During his coaching career, Harder served as interim manager of the Indians for the last game of the 1961 season and the last two games of 1962, winning all three contests. Late in his tenure, prominent young pitchers as Sam McDowell, Tommy John and Luis Tiant would come under his guidance. He was fired after the 1963 season, having spent the first 36 years of his adult life in Cleveland.

He later coached with the New York Mets (1964), Chicago Cubs (1965), Cincinnati Reds (1966–68) and Kansas City Royals (1969).

Cleveland retired his number 18 on July 28, 1990 (he wore 43 and 2 as a coach), and he was named one of the Indians&#x27; top 100 players in 2001.

In 2002, Harder died in Chardon, Ohio at age 93; at the time of his death, he had been one of only five living players who had played in the 1920s.

==Legacy==

Harder is one of only four pitchers to pitch at least twenty seasons with one team (the others are Red Faber, Walter Johnson and Ted Lyons). He threw the first pitch ever thrown at Cleveland Municipal Stadium in a 1932 game and six decades later threw the first pitch in the construction site of its successor in Jacobs Field (now known as Progressive Field) in 1992.

Joe DiMaggio recalled that he had more difficulty batting against Harder than against just about any other pitcher. Hank Greenberg also named him one of the five toughest pitchers he faced in his career.

<text>&quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; is a song by Canadian rock band Rush, released from their 1980 album &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;. The song&#x27;s name was inspired by Brampton, Ontario based radio station CFNY-FM&#x27;s slogan. It was significant in the growing popularity of the band, becoming their first top 30 single in Canada and reaching number 51 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

==Background==
The introduction of the song was composed in a mixolydian mode scale built on E; most of the rest, barring repetitions of the introductory guitar riff, is in conventional E major.

Guitarist Alex Lifeson explained the song&#x27;s opening riff as &quot;I just wanted to give it something that gave it a sense of static – radio waves bouncing around, very electric. We had that sequence going underneath, and it was just really to try and get something that was sitting on top of it, that gave it that movement.&quot;

&quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; features the band experimenting with a reggae style in its closing section. Reggae would be explored further on the band&#x27;s next three records, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, &quot;Signals&quot;, and &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;. The group had experimented with reggae-influenced riffs in the studio and had come up with a reggae introduction to &quot;Working Man&quot; on their tours, so they decided to incorporate a passage into &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;, and as Lifeson said, &quot;to make us smile and have a little fun&quot;.

Lyrically, the song is a lament on the change of FM radio from free-form to commercial formats during the late 1970s. The Brampton, Ontario based station CFNY-FM—which had &quot;not&quot; abandoned free-form programming—is cited as an inspiration for the song. The reggae finale also has lyrics inspired by the song &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; by Simon &amp; Garfunkel.

==Single release==
Rush had grazed the UK Top 40 two years earlier with &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, but when &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; was issued as a single in February 1980, it reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart in March. It remains their biggest UK hit to date (the 7&quot; single was a 3:00 edited version which has not appeared on CD, as of 2011). In the US, the single peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1980 and number 22 in Canada, and in 1998 a live version of the song reached number 27 on the Mainstream Rock Chart.

Promotional 12-inch copies were released in the United States in late 1979 with the B-sides of &quot;Working Man&quot; and &quot;The Trees&quot;, and the song being incorrectly titled &quot;The Spirit of the Radio&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;Geddy Lee&#x27;s high vocals and the band&#x27;s electrically charged instrumental should click on AOR lists.&quot;

&quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; was named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and was among five Rush songs inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame on March 28, 2010. &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;crafty rocker that&#x27;s an out-of-the-box AOR-pop smash.&quot;

&quot;Classic Rock&quot; readers voted &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; the fourth best Rush song.

The song was covered by the British alternative rock band Catherine Wheel in 1996, with their version appearing both on their B-sides and rarities album &quot;Like Cats and Dogs&quot; and on the CFNY-branded compilation album &quot;Spirit of the Edge, Vol. 2&quot;.

== Music video ==
In celebration of the 40th anniversary of &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;, on June 12, 2020 Rush produced an animated music video by Fantoons Animation Studio featuring themselves as they appeared around 1980 as well as nods to Guglielmo Marconi (an Italian inventor instrumental in the development of radio) as well as radio djs from the time that were influential in Rush&#x27;s development. The video also pays homage to Rush&#x27;s drummer, the late Neil Peart, &quot;whose music and lyrics continue to capture the hearts and imaginations of the fans&quot;.

<doc id="1119477" wikidata="Q925607" url="?curid=1119477" title="General Motors 54° V6 engine">
<text>General Motors&#x27; Opel subsidiary in Europe designed a compact V6 engine with an unusual 54° vee angle. It was an iron block/aluminum head DOHC design with four valves per cylinder. All 54° engines were assembled at Ellesmere Port in England.

==History==

In the early 1990s, Opel identified the need for a modern, lightweight, and compact power plant to replace its aging straight-six engine range. These engines have a cast-iron engine block with cast aluminium alloy cylinder heads. The cylinder heads contain four valves per cylinder actuated by dual overhead camshafts which are driven by a timing belt. These engines, however, differed from many modern V6 engines in that it has a 54-degree cylinder bank angle as opposed to the more conventional 60-degree or 90-degree setup. This added to the engines&#x27; compactness which was needed to allow its use in front-wheel-drive applications, as well as rear-wheel-drive cars. Other features of these engines included an oil-to-water heat exchanger mounted within the V of the engine block, Bosch Motronic engine management system with full sequential fuel injection, knock control on each bank, Distributorless Ignition System (DIS), and closed-loop lambda sensor control.

Minor changes were made to the unit during its production, including an uprated oil pump around mid-1997, with the addition of larger oilways in the head machining (T-vents), and modified valve lifters to reduce top-end valve noise, at which point the cam belt arrangement also changed with the lower idler moving. Around 1998, the spin-on metal canister oil filter was changed to a disposable paper element.

==Revision==

The engine was reworked substantially in 2000 in order to meet increasing emissions requirements, with the 2.5L and 3.0L being replaced by lower-compression 2.6L and 3.2L units. While displacement was changed the bore centers and deck height were retained. These later power plants had a revised engine management system setup, which used quad lambda sensor control, coil-per-plug ignition system and drive-by-wire throttles. As a result of these changes, the EGR and secondary air injection system were removed.

==Recalls==

In its 3.0 L form, this engine was notable for recalls of all units installed in Cadillac Cateras due to timing belt tensioner bearing failures, which could cause catastrophic damage to the engine because of its interference design.

==2.5==

The C25XE or B258I has an bore and stroke which displaces . It produces a &quot;Deutsches Institut für Normung&quot; (DIN) rated output of @ 6,000 rpm, and generates @ 3,200 rpm of torque. It was introduced in the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier (both codenamed &quot;Vectra-A&quot;) and Opel/Vauxhall Calibra. It features a Bosch Motronic 2.8.1 engine management system (Omega), with later examples featuring M2.8.3 (Calibra 1994, Vectra 1995) and a compression ratio of 10.8:1.

For 1994, in order to meet more stringent emissions requirements, a secondary air injection system and an EGR valve were added to the C25XE and it became the X25XE. The exception being the 1997 Calibras, which due to unavailability of C25XE engine blocks, were produced using the X25XE block but without modifications to the top end of the engine, and without addition of EGR. The X25XE also benefitted from a higher-volume oil pump. Firing order is 1-2-3-4-5-6.

The breakdown of the engine name is as follows:

* X – Exhaust emissions level: 94/12/EC, stage 2
* 25 – Displacement: 2.5 litres

* 1993–1998 Saab 900
* 1993–1995 Vauxhall Cavalier

===MSD version===
A special edition of the X25XE was worked by Motor Sports Developments (MSD); which includes reprofiled camshafts, giving the engine an increase of . This engine appeared in two special edition Vauxhall Vectras: first the Vectra ST200 (not the normal SuperTouring), and then the Vectra 2.5 GSi V6.

Applications:
* Vauxhall Vectra ST200
* Vauxhall Vectra 2.5 GSi

==3.0==

The X30XE, L81, B308I, or B308E has a bore and stroke which displaces with a compression ratio between 9.5:1 and 10.8:1. The naturally-aspirated version of the engine produces between , , and @ 6,000 rpm with to @ 3,400 rpm. The B308E is a slightly modified X30XE used in the Saab 9-5. Engine management systems are Bosch Motronic M2.8.1, and later (approx. 2000) M2.8.3. Firing order is 1-2-3-4-5-6.

* X – Exhaust emissions level: 94/12/EC, stage 2
* 30 – Displacement: 3.0 litres
* X – Compression ratio: 10.0–11.5:1
* E – Mixture system: Injection
Applications:
* 1997–2001 Cadillac Catera
* 1996–2000 Opel Sintra

* 2002–2003 Saturn Vue

===B308E===
For 1997, Saab introduced a turbocharged version called the B308E for its 9-5 model. The engine produced at 5000 rpm and of torque at 2500–4000 rpm. The engine was unique in that it used asymmetrical turbocharging, with the turbocharger driven by the exhaust gases from only one bank of cylinders. A charge pressure of was produced using a Garrett GT15 turbo. The engine was equipped with a special version of Saab Direct Ignition and used the Trionic T7 engine management system. This turbocharged version of the engine weighs .

Applications:
* 1997–2003 Saab 9-5

==2.6==

The Y26SE or LY9 engine has a displacement of with a bore and stroke of , developing a maximum power output of and of torque with a 10.0:1 compression ratio. 

Applications:

* Opel Omega B
* Opel Vectra B
* Cadillac CTS (Europe)

==3.2==

The LA3 or Y32SE is a complete redesign of the L81 for the Cadillac CTS and Opel Omega B. It had fixed (non-variable) valve timing, and a variable length intake manifold. The engine has a bore and stroke with a 10.0:1 compression ratio. This engine produced at 6000 rpm and at 3400 rpm. Production started in July 2001, but the engine was replaced by the new GM High Feature engine starting in 2004.

<text>Aumale (), formerly known as Albemarle, is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region in north-western France. It lies on the River Bresle.

==History==

The town&#x27;s Latin name was &quot;Alba Marla&quot;. It was raised by William the Bastard into a county, for his half-sister, Adelaide of Normandy. It was then held by various Norman and English nobles until its confiscation in 1196 by Philip II of France. Thereafter it was held by the houses of Dammartin, Castile, Harcourt, and Lorraine. In 1547, it was raised to the status of a duchy for Francis of Lorraine. It passed to the house of Savoy, from whom Louis XIV purchased the title in 1675 in order to bestow it upon one of his bastards as an appanage. In 1769, it passed to the House of Orléans. The English Earls of Albemarle, meanwhile, also derive their name from the area.

During World War II, the town was occupied by Germany. The SS operated a subcamp of the V SS construction brigade, in which over 500 men, mostly Poles and Soviets, worked as slave labour on the construction of facilities for the V-1 flying bombs. The prisoners tried to resist the Germans, and several were murdered for sabotaging the rockets or escape attempts. In August 1944, due to Allied advance, the Germans dissolved the subcamp and deported its prisoners to subcamps of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp.
==Geography==
A village of farming and associated light industry, situated in the valley of the Bresle of the Norman Pays de Bray in Normandy on the border with Picardy. It is around southeast of Dieppe at the junction of the D 916, D 920, D 929 and D 49 roads. The A29 autoroute (Saint-Quentin-Beuzeville) passes through the commune&#x27;s northern sector.

<text>RTVI is a global Russian-speaking multi-platform media, which includes a news website (about 4 million users per month) and other digital platforms (2.7 million subscribers): 6 YouTube channels, 2 Telegram channels and accounts in all major social networks.

As of 2023, it broadcasts in 159 countries. It has more than 350 broadcasting operators around the world and 20 million viewers. 
==History==

=== 1990s ===
In 1997, the channel was founded as &quot;NTV International&quot; by Vladimir Gusinsky, where it would serve as the &quot;international, license-cleared version&quot; of the NTV channel. Its main audiences were the Russian-speaking diasporas of Israel, the United States, and Europe.

===2000s===
Following the Kursk disaster, numerous independent media outlets became very critical of Vladimir Putin who later would support an agenda for the state to gain control of these outlets.

In the early 2000s Kiselev sold a majority stake in the network to a group of Russian and foreign investors. The change brought about shifts in editorial direction and programming.

In April 2002, two independent broadcasters the Andrey Norkin and Vyacheslav Kriskevich associated Echo (), which is the television version of the radio station Echo of Moscow, and the Yevgeny Kiselyov associated TV6, which aired the program &quot;Grani&quot; () by Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was an advisor to Vladimir Putin opponent Boris Nemtsov, and would rename itself as TVS, began offering their products to the NTV-International channel, which planned to change its name to RTV or &quot;Russia Televion&quot;. Both Vyacheslav Kriskevich, who was a presenter of &quot;Today on TV6&quot; «Сегодня на ТВ-6», which later was renamed &quot;Now&quot; (), and Andrey Norkin, who both had been employed by TV6, moved their support to RTV instead of TVS.

From 2004 to 2012, Vladimir Kara-Murza who received strong support from Mikhail Khodorkovsky, directed the Washington bureau of RTVi until Ruslan Sokolov took ownership of RTV which led to Kara-Murza&#x27;s dismissal.

===2012, 2017, and 2019 ownership changes===
RTVI was owned by a former director of the Russian state TV channel Zvezda the Russian businessman Ruslan Sokolov () who bought the channel from Gusinsky in 2012.

A group of Israeli private investors purchased RTVI International channel in 2017. In June 2017, The channel, which planned to enter the Russian market, was relaunched with the liberal Dozhd TV&#x27;s pink colors in its new logo, new presenters and editors some of which were from Dozhd or from former NTV&#x27;s independent editorial board. Alexey Pivovarov, who had worked as a manager at STS and is a strong supporter of the old NTV, headed RTVI International until 2020 when he left RTVi to run his 2019 established YouTube channel. Vasily Brovko, Sergey Chemezov and Rostec also were supporting the relaunch. In the Spring of 2019, Yulia Moskvitina chaired the board of directors and Tatyana Druzhnyaeva headed RTVI as the executive director.

In October 2019, the Armenia-born American Mikayel Israyelyan was named the new owner of RTVI.

==Staff==
RTVi&#x27;s News Director till June 2020 was Ekaterina Kotrikadze. Russian journalist Alexey Pivovarov was appointed editor-in-chief in 2016. Pivovarov remained in this position till 25 June 2020. On 10 March 2022, the general producer of RTVI Sergey Shnurov announced the temporary termination of cooperation with RTVI.

<text>The Sarantine Mosaic is a historical fantasy duology by Canadian writer Guy Gavriel Kay, comprising &quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot; (1998) and &quot;Lord of Emperors&quot; (2000). The titles of the novels allude to works by poet W. B. Yeats.

The story&#x27;s setting is based on the 6th-century Mediterranean world, and the looming conflict between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy that had replaced the Western Roman Empire. Varena, the capital of Batiara, alludes to Ravenna, the Ostrogothic capital, while Sarantium, the capital of the Sarantine Empire, is inspired by Byzantium or Constantinople. The novels &quot;The Lions of Al-Rassan&quot;, &quot;The Last Light of the Sun&quot;, and &quot;A Brightness Long Ago&quot; also take place in that unnamed world, although in different settings. In the series the audience is also briefly acquainted with the character Ashar ibn Ashar, who is the creator of the Asharite religion seen in &quot;The Lions of Al-Rassan&quot;. The seeds of change for the great empire based in Sarantium are thus already being sown even at the height of its power and prestige.

==&quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot;==
&quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot;, the first novel in the saga, was published in 1998. In this novel, mosaicist Caius Crispus (&quot;Crispin&quot;), is summoned from Varena to the great metropolis of Sarantium to create a mosaic for Emperor Valerius II (modelled on Byzantine emperor Justinian I). Crispin has lost his family to plague, and has nothing left to him except his mosaic art, for which he is earning attention. The narration follows his travels from the relatively civilized Batiara through the wilder region of Sauradia, where he has an encounter with a creature of supernatural aspect resembling a bison, to Sarantium itself and his compelled entrance into the politics of the metropolis, centred on Valerius and his consort, the Empress Alixana (modelled on Justinian&#x27;s empress, Theodora). While Crispin is a central focus of the book, there are other stories interwoven with his. Overcoming loss (loss of family, loss of the past), rebuilding (life, civilization), journey as change and the importance of art to the individual creator and to civilization itself are themes of the novel. The title and much of the thematic development alludes to the poem Sailing to Byzantium, a work of the Irish poet William Butler Yeats.

Plot

Emperor Apius of Sarantium dies without any heirs, leaving the empire in uncertainty. Petrus of Trakesia plans to have his uncle, Valerius of Trakesia, the Count of the Excubitors (Imperial Guard), become the next emperor. He plants his own men among the different factions to make, and purposely botch, an attempt to have them support Flavius Daleinus, a rich and influential aristocrat with plans to become emperor, thus discrediting Flavius&#x27;s name. At the same time, and also ordered by Petrus, Flavius is murdered on the streets with Sarantine fire while wearing porphyry, a colour exclusive to royalty, and his eldest son is left hideously burned. Valerius is then appointed as the new Emperor by popular demand.

Fifteen years later, Petrus has succeeded his uncle, naming himself Valerius II and making Alixana, formerly Aliana, his empress. Valerius II commissions a great sanctuary to Jad and summons Martinian of Batiara, a renowned mosaicist, to decorate it. The royal request is sent with Pronobius Tilliticus, an Imperial Courier, who delays delivery of the message while pursuing personal pleasure along the road. Martinian, partially on whim and partially believing himself too old to travel, causes Tilliticus to mistake his friend and colleague Caius Crispus (&quot;Crispin&quot;) of Rhodias for him, delivering the message in a public fashion. Crispin is reluctant to accept the prestigious summons, having lost the desire to live when his wife and two daughters died of the plague the previous year. The summons having been much delayed, the season no longer allows Crispin to sail to Sarantium; he must take the road. Martinian sends Crispin to talk to his old and well-traveled friend Zoticus for advice on his journey. Zoticus reveals himself to have some supernatural powers and gives Crispin a mechanical bird, Linon, that is alive, being able to both talk to him aloud and within his mind. He also gives Crispin the name of his daughter and another person in Sarantium who may be able to help him.

The night before he is to leave, Crispin is forcibly abducted and taken to Gisel, the queen of the Antae and ruler over Batiara and Rhodias. The Antae are suspicious that a woman, especially a young one, can rule effectively and Gisel is barely holding onto her throne and life after the recent death of her father. She gives Crispin a secret message to be given only to Emperor Valerius II: an offer of her hand in marriage, which would save her life and give Valerius the western kingdom as well as an heir, as the imperial couple is childless. The palace guards from that night are killed to protect the secret.

Crispin starts his journey under the assumed identity of Martinian, hiring a man named Vargos as his servant. The night before the Day of the Dead, during which Zoticus warned him not to travel, Crispin arrives at an inn where a slave girl, Kasia, begs him to save her, having figured out she is to be given as a human sacrifice to the pagan god on the Day of the Dead. Despite devising an ingenious plan that forces the innkeeper to give him ownership of Kasia, Crispin with his companions is still pursued as they leave the inn, deeming it necessary to travel on the Day of the Dead despite all warnings. They are saved by a zubir, a corporeal representation of the pagan god, which then brings them to the forested area where the human sacrifices are performed. Linon realizes the god wants only her, revealing that she was a girl to be sacrificed to the god long ago but her soul was saved and placed in the bird by Zoticus. She sacrifices herself, releasing her soul from the bird, and allowing the others to leave unharmed.

While admiring an old and impressive mosaic in a sanctuary along the road, Crispin is found by Carullus, a captain leading a squad of soldiers; he has been sent by Valerius due to extended time it has taken to respond to the Emperor&#x27;s summons. After an initial rough encounter, resulting in Crispin being knocked unconscious by Carullus and Vargos and Kasia almost being raped and killed, the group slowly become friends as they finally arrive in Sarantium.

Shortly after arriving, Crispin is immediately summoned to the Emperor and the court, at a speed that is unheard of in the empire. Risking his life, Crispin reveals his true identity only to find out that the Emperor and Empress knew his and Martinian&#x27;s deception from the beginning. Crispin quickly finds favour with them, causing the royal mosaicist to be dismissed and angering his sponsor, Styliane Daleina, the daughter of the murdered Flavius Daleina and new wife of Leontes, the beloved royal Strategos. The Emperor gives Crispin the honour of decorating the newly erected sanctuary, and Empress Alixana publicly invites Crispin for a private audience later that night.

Crispin&#x27;s private audience with the Empress is interrupted by the Emperor and the two reveal that they know of Gisel&#x27;s secret offer of marriage, while Crispin neither confirms or denies the message. It becomes clear that the Emperor will not put aside his beloved though believed to be barren wife - an assumed consequence of her former life as a dancer - but informs both that he had long since summoned the queen to Sarantium, where he plans to use her as an excuse to invade the west and reunite the kingdoms under his rule. The Emperor then brings Crispin to the sanctuary to show him where he is to work, before leaving him under the protection of Carullus to return home.

While returning home, Crispin is attacked by assassins, but survives due to the help of Carullus and the famous and beloved Scortius of the Blues, the most renowned charioteer of the city. Crispin returns to his room only to find Styliane Daleina there; she propositions him and is amused when he rejects her advances.

The next day, while relaxing in a bath house, Crispin finds himself alone with Leontes, the latter having arranged it to discuss his views on the blasphemy of depicting Jad in human form. Before leaving, Leontes exposes another armed assassin entering the sauna, giving Crispin just enough time to overcome his attacker while looking on and refusing to help.

Crispin makes contact with Zoticus&#x27;s daughter, Shirin, principal dancer of the Greens. She is revealed to also have one of her father&#x27;s birds whose thoughts Crispin is able to hear for unknown reasons. With the help of Vargos, it is learned that the assassins were hired by Pronobius Tilliticus as revenge for losing his job when Crispin indirectly revealed his inappropriate and disloyal services.

In Batiara, three Antae noblemen plot to murder Gisel during the dedication of the sanctuary where her father is to be buried. However, on the day of the assassination, it is discovered that the woman believed to be the queen is her servant in disguise. Gisel, with Zoticus&#x27;s help, has fled to Sarantium. Zoticus, upon learning that the pagan god had not forgotten nor relinquished his right to the souls of the human sacrifices given to him, journeys to the forested area where Linon had sacrificed herself to the zubir. There he allows the remaining souls in his mechanical birds to be released back to the god and accepts his death from the zubir, a punishment from taking the souls of the sacrificed woman in the first place.

Crispin further entwines himself into court life and finds reason to continue living through his task of decorating the great sanctuary, through which he sees a chance of immortality. The book ends with an unknown female figure entering the sanctuary while Crispin is working, irresistibly drawing him down to greet her.

==&quot;Lord of Emperors&quot;==
&quot;Lord of Emperors&quot; was published in 2000. The story continues from &quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot; and tells of what happens to Crispin after his arrival in the city of Sarantium. Crispin has been charged with a project to cover the interior of the dome of a grand new religious building in Sarantium with a mosaic work. The confidant of both Alixana, the empress, and of the exiled Queen Gisel of Crispin&#x27;s native Batiara (modelled on the Ostrogoth queen, Amalasuntha), Crispin struggles to survive the political machinations of the era and work on his mosaic. The reader is also introduced to Rustem of Kerakek, a physician from Bassania, an eastern empire roughly analogous to Sassanid Persia, who has also journeyed to the city, finding himself entangled in political intrigue. A significant theme of the book is the interplay between the lives of the politically powerful and the interests of the ordinary people, typified by the chariot races at the hippodrome which become an all-consuming passion for the people even as the empire draws closer to war and upheaval.

Plot

Rustem of Kerakek, a physician from Bassania, is summoned by Shirvan, the King of Kings of Bassania, after being wounded with a poisoned arrow. Rustem saves his life and helps reveal that it is the king&#x27;s son who was behind the assassination attempt. Shirvan rewards the doctor with the promise of raising him to the priestly caste and making him a court physician. However, Shirvan first commands Rustem to go to Sarantium to act as his spy. He leaves behind his two wives and their children, a baby girl and a seven-year-old boy named Shaksi who is suggested to have unusual powers of perception. Shaksi&#x27;s premonitions later compel the family to depart from Kerakek and follow Rustem to Sarantium.

In the capital, Crispin has further settled into his work of creating the mosaic in the sanctuary. He plans to immortalize his wife and daughters, as well as Linon and an image of the zubir, alongside Jad. Carullus has proposed to Kasia and their wedding draws together most of the influential people of the city through the help of their friends. Upon arriving in Sarantium, Rustem&#x27;s servant (who is secretly his guard and protector) is murdered by a young aristocrat. In the process of fleeing for his life through the city, Rustem meets Crispin, who brings him to Kasia and Carullus&#x27;s wedding. There Rustem discovers that the murderer of his servant is Cleander, the son of the Master of the Senate. He approaches the family and subtly blackmails the Senator with this information to secure himself a home and protection in the city as compensation. It is revealed that Rustem was the second person Zoticus had told Crispin to meet - somehow knowing the Bassanid would go to Sarantium long before his arrival. Rustem quickly establishes himself practicing medicine in the city but is disturbed when he receives an order from the King of Kings to assassinate a woman.

Emperor Valerius II makes it known to a few that he intends to wage war to reclaim Batiara in the name of Queen Gisel. Crispin, while at the house of Leontes, allows himself to be seduced by Styliane this time, and escapes through the window when Leontes returns. Styliane tells him of the upcoming invasion of his homeland and also warns him not to become attached to his work.

It is revealed that Empress Alixana was the woman who approached Crispin at the end of the first novel. She again comes to Crispin as he finishes his wife&#x27;s image in the mosaic and is about to begin that of his daughters. She takes him on a boat ride under the premise of showing him dolphins, which she wishes him to put in a mosaic for her private chambers. This depiction is a dangerous one for the Empress to request due to dolphins&#x27; association with the god Heladikos, who some worship as the son of Jad but has been declared paganistic and heretical by the Patriarchs of the faith. The boat arrives at an island where Lecanus Daleinus, the oldest son of the assassinated Flavius Daleinus, is imprisoned; he was hideously burned and blinded by Sarantine Fire during the assassination. Alixana impersonates Styliane&#x27;s voice to try get information from him. Crispin hears the thoughts of yet another mechanical bird talking to Lecanus in his head and realises that although Lecanus cannot see the Empress, he is not deceived. After they leave, he confesses what he heard to Alixana, who quickly deduces that an assassination attempt is being made on her husband. They return to Lecanus&#x27;s hut only to find him gone and his guards killed. A guard attempts to assassinate Alixana but is stopped by Crispin. Alixana tells Crispin to return to the boat with one of her two remaining loyal guards and asks him how he found a reason to live after having lost his family. She returns to Sarantium on a small boat with her remaining guard, discarding her royal robes, cutting her hair, and changing her appearance. Upon arriving in the docks, she disappears into the crowds, disguised as a whore.

Emperor Valerius II is confronted by all three surviving Daleinoi children, including Styliane and Lecanus, in his personal passage between palaces, his guards having been bribed. He quickly deduces that they intend to kill him with Sarantine fire as revenge for the death of their father. He banters with them, trying to undermine each of them and their hold on the guards. He almost succeeds escaping, but is stabbed in the back by Leontes&#x27;s secretary, Pertennius Eubulus - a man who hated the Emperor and Empress, perceiving them to be impious. Lecanus burns the Emperor&#x27;s body along with the guards before allowing himself to be burned, taking the sole blame for the events.

The city erupts in a riot. Leontes is quickly chosen as the new Emperor while Styliane claimed to have arrived too late to stop her brother after learning of his plans. A citywide search for the Empress is started, with guards going from house to house. Rustem, returning home late after treating many riot victims, finds Empress Alixana in his bedroom. She quickly reveals she knew his goal as a spy and asks his help in hiding her while revealing that she knew he had already refused orders to assassinate Queen Gisel. It is also revealed Alixana had already visited the doctor in disguise as a commoner with fertility problems, and Rustem had informed her that she was not barren - thus the imperial couple&#x27;s failure to conceive an heir is due to the Emperor&#x27;s sterility. Rustem helps save her life as she pretends to be a prostitute when the Saratine soldiers break into the doctor&#x27;s home. After the soldiers leave, Rustem allows Alixana to stay the night, finding her gone in the morning.

That same night, Gisel summons Crispin and has him help her slip into the palace. Gisel manages to meet with Leontes, persuading him to see Styliane&#x27;s role in the whole event and convincing him to take her as his new wife. In doing so, the new emperor will have a means of re-taking Batiara while minimizing bloodshed. Styliane is blinded and imprisoned on the same isle her brother had been on, while her remaining brother is found and executed.

Based on information given to him by Alixana before her departure, Rustem realizes that he cannot return to Bassania or he will be killed by the King of Kings for his failure to assassinate Gisel. His family then arrives on his doorstep, accompanied by the soldier who first brought the doctor to Shirvan. Together, they decide that they will travel yet further west, to the peninsula of Esperana, and settle there.

Leontes explains to Crispin that all images of Jad are to be destroyed and images of humans and Jad in sanctuaries are seen as blasphemy. Crispin is crushed by the news that his mosaic is to be destroyed, seeing it as a second death of his wife and daughters. He decides to finish the images of his daughters before they are destroyed anyway, and once they are complete, that it is time to return home.

Crispin says goodbye to all his friends. He is summoned a final time by the new Empress Gisel, and is permitted to go visit Styliane before he leaves. Styliane asks Crispin to kill her, realizing life had nothing left for her in her current state and having already achieved her revenge. He refuses but leaves a dagger that Gisel had, knowingly, given him during their meeting. Shirin confronts Crispin before he leaves where she manages to get Crispin to indirectly indicate he has feelings for her and that she should perhaps eventually join him in Batiara.

Upon arriving home, Crispin finds Martinian and royal couriers waiting for him. Gisel has greatly rewarded him with wealth, as she had originally promised if he were to successfully deliver her message to Emperor Valerius II. She has also sent him materials from Sarantium, such as high-quality glass and stones, needed to create a great mosaic, promising the work would be protected as long as no image of Jad is made.

Crispin spends the next year making an elaborate mosaic in a small abandoned sanctuary, while Martinian decorates the adjoining larger and newer sanctuary in an appropriate way, finally having access to the great materials he had always dreamed of throughout his career. Crispin&#x27;s mosaic depicts the newly appointed Emperor Valerius III (formerly Leontes) and Empress Gisel on one side and the former Emperor Valerius II and Empress Alixana on the other, with all the important figures of court that Crispin had known, including himself, around them.

In a mirror of the ending of the first book, just as Crispin finishes the last piece of his mosaic, a woman distracts him from his work. Assuming it is Shirin finally come to meet him, he is surprised to see Aliana, no longer Alixana after having disappeared that night. She comments on herself in the mosaic and the two of them realize that they have a reason in each other to continue living. The novel ends with the suggestion that they might have a child together.

==References to other novels==
This novel takes place in the same world as &quot;The Lions of Al-Rassan,&quot; &quot;The Last Light of the Sun,&quot; &quot;Children of Earth and Sky&quot;, and &quot;A Brightness Long Ago&quot;. As in the other novels, the three main religions of the Jaddites, Kindath and Asharites are presented based on Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, respectively. Events of the Sarantine Mosaic take place centuries before those of the other four set in the shared world.

It is implied that Rustem is the ancestor of Rodrigo Belmonte from &quot;The Lions of Al-Rassan&quot;.

==Reception==
Reviewing &quot;Lord of Emperors&quot;, Charles de Lint praised both volumes, saying &quot;Kay&#x27;s books ring with authenticity. They are literate and imaginative, and work on many levels. History aficionados will delight in all the small and telling insights Kay brings to the era and its cultures, while other readers will simply delight in the grand sweep of the story, the rich characterization, and Kay&#x27;s sheer gift with language.&quot;

<text>Muzaffarabad (; , IPA: ) is a city in Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir in the disputed Kashmir region. It is the largest city and the capital of Azad Kashmir, which is a Pakistani-administered administrative territory.

The city is located in Muzaffarabad District, near the confluence of the Jhelum and Neelum rivers. The district is bounded by the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the west, the Kupwara and Baramulla districts of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir in the east, and the Neelum District in the north.

==History==
Muzaffarabad was founded in 1646 by Sultan Muzaffar Khan, chief of the Bomba tribe who ruled Kashmir. Khan also constructed the Red Fort that same year for the purpose of warding off incursions from the Mughal Empire.

=== Indo-Pakistani war of 1947 ===

The Battle of Muzaffarabad occurred on 22 October 1947 between Pakistani-backed Pashtun tribesmen, pro-Pakistani Kashmiri rebels, and the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces in the town of Muzaffarabad. The battle resulted in a rapid defeat of the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces, leading to the capture of Muzaffarabad by the tribesmen.
=== 2005 earthquake ===
The city was near the epicenter of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.6 Mw. The earthquake destroyed about 50 percent of the buildings in the city (including most government buildings) and is estimated to have killed up to 80,000 people in the Pakistani-controlled areas. , the Pakistani government&#x27;s official death toll was 87,350, while other estimates have put the death toll at over 100,000.
== Administrative subdivisions ==
The district of Muzaffarabad is administratively divided into 2 tehsils, which are subdivided into 25 union councils.

* Muzaffarabad
* Pattika (Naseerabad)

==Climate==
== Transport ==

Muzaffarabad&#x27;s public transportation system primarily relies on buses, rickshaws, and small pickup trucks for intracity travel. Following the devastating 2005 earthquake that severely damaged infrastructure, including roads, the city government, with international aid, rebuilt roads, bridges, and other essential infrastructure. However, public transportation remains underdeveloped. Notably, Muzaffarabad lacks a railway system and a functional airport. The nearest railway station is located in the Rawalpindi District of Pakistani Punjab.

<text>Munson (Formally Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute) is a regional fine arts center founded in 1919 and located in Utica, New York. The institute has three program divisions, museum of art, performing arts and school of art.

==Museum of art==
The museum of art has a substantial permanent collection of internationally recognized works. They are exhibited in the Munson Museum of Art Building. It is an International-style building designed by architect Philip Johnson and completed in 1960. A model of the building was exhibited in the United States Pavilion at the Brussels&#x27; World&#x27;s Fair of 1958. It is a 60,000 sqft square and supported by eight external ferro-concrete piers, or two on each side. The exterior structural members are clad in bronze and &quot;black&quot; Canadian granite. The windowless cube is set above windowed office areas recessed in a dry moat, giving a &quot;floating&quot; effect. The interior features a two-story central courtyard, illuminated by a skylight, known as the Edward Wales Root Sculpture Court. It also holds an auditorium seating 271. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

Next-door is a Victorian-era Italianate mansion called &quot;Fountain Elms&quot;, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It houses the Munson decorative arts collection. It is connected to the Museum of Art building by an education wing built in 1995.

The museum has an extensive collection of European and American art. A highlight of the permanent collection is the first of the two original sets of Thomas Cole&#x27;s famous series of paintings titled &quot;The Voyage of Life&quot;: The second set is at the National Gallery Washington, DC.

In 2023, as part of a rebranding effort facilitated by a Brooklyn-based design agency, the museum rebranded itself simply &quot;Munson&quot;. The museum president stated that despite its familiarity, few people knew the entire 10-syllable name of the museum.

==School of art==
The art school was begun 1936, when The Arts Guild of New York City moved its school to a remodeled garage on the ground of the Institute and, under the name of the &quot;School of Related Arts and Sciences&quot;, began to offer courses in visual arts, the history and philosophy of art, and comparative symbolism.

In 1999, Munson became a satellite campus of the Pratt Institute. A program called &quot;Pratt at Munson-Williams-Proctor&quot; or PrattMWP allows students to study for two years in Utica, New York, called a &quot;Foundations Program&quot;, before completing their Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Pratt Institute&#x27;s main campus in Brooklyn, New York. PrattMWP is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, Middle States Association, and New York State Education Department.

<text>USS &quot;Burns&quot; (DD-171) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Burns&quot;, named for Otway Burns, was launched 4 July 1918 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California; sponsored by Miss Alice H. Palmer, and commissioned 7 August 1919.

&quot;Burns&quot; was attached to Destroyer Force, Pacific, until March 1920 when she was ordered to special duty as a tender for NC Seaplane Division. On 15 March 1921 she was reclassified DM-11 and on 5 May she was assigned to the Mine Force, Pacific. She was at Mare Island Navy Yard 11 July undergoing conversion and overhaul when her home yard was changed and she departed for Naval Station Pearl Harbor, where she completed the yard period. Thereafter, attached to Mine Squadron 2 Pacific Fleet, she served throughout her active service in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands except for periodic concentrations of the Fleet in other areas for maneuvers and Fleet problems.

In 1925 she joined the Fleet for a tour of Australia and New Zealand. In the summers of 1926, 1927, and 1928 she conducted training cruises for Naval Reservists. In 1927 &quot;Burns&quot; returned to San Diego with her squadron for inspection, training, and recreation. Returning to Pearl Harbor, she participated in mining and gunnery practice, and acted as a high-speed target for submarines in Hawaiian waters until November 1929. Arriving at San Diego 26 November, &quot;Burns&quot; was decommissioned 2 June 1930. On 11 June she was towed to Mare Island Navy Yard where she was used as a barracks ship. She was later scrapped and her material sold 22 April 1932.

<doc id="1119519" wikidata="Q912249" url="?curid=1119519" title="Fender Jag-Stang">
<text>The Fender Jag-Stang is an electric guitar produced by Fender and designed by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. It was intended as a hybrid of two Fender electric guitars models: the Jaguar and the Mustang.

==Origins==
Cobain suggested his idea for an instrument to Fender, resulting in two left-handed prototypes built by former Custom Shop Master Builder Larry L. Brooks, only one of which was played by Cobain himself. In an interview from January 4, 1994, Cobain talked about designing the Jag-Stang, since it had not yet been produced. He stated to Nardwuar the Human Serviette that he designed it by taking a Polaroid of a Mustang and a Jaguar, cutting them in half and pasting them together. It was shipped back to Fender for repairs before Cobain brought it with him on the European leg of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;In Utero&quot; tour in 1994, where the guitar was seldom played live. Cobain sketched a basic design that was sent to Fender, which was later published as part of his &quot;Journals&quot; in 2002.

According to Cobain&#x27;s guitar tech Earnie Bailey, the Jag-stang was played live only a few times; at Nirvana&#x27;s concert at Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana, Slovenia, he used the Jag-Stang for the entire show. Kurt played the song Dumb with a Jag-Stang, but played the Fender Mustang on almost the entire set. “I’d say he played the Jag-Stang between two and five times on stage,” Bailey says. “There was an early show where he may have used it for a song or two, and later on he may have used it for an entire show.” Bailey says that, to his knowledge, Cobain never recorded with the guitar. “Kurt tended to record with guitars that he liked to play live, guitars he was real comfortable with,” Bailey says, “and at that point the Jag-Stang wasn’t one of them. I believe the guitar showed up not long before the &quot;In Utero&quot; tour began, and there wasn’t a lot of recording going on then anyway.”

Even though Fender had built the Jag-Stang to Cobain&#x27;s specs, Bailey modified it as Cobain found things he wanted adjusted. “Basically everything that came in, including the Jag-Stang, I modified,” Bailey says. “Kurt’s older Jaguar was already pretty heavily modded and he liked it pretty much the way it was. But there were always changes of one kind or another to almost everything”.

==Design==
Cobain&#x27;s prototype Jag-Stang had a Fender Texas Special pickup at the neck and a DiMarzio H-3 at the bridge. The production Jag-Stang includes a &quot;vintage style&quot; single coil pickup and one &quot;special design&quot; humbucker, each with its own toggle switch which a player can use to switch from &quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, or &quot;out-of-phase&quot; settings. It employs the Mustang&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Vibrato&quot; bridge and, like both of its predecessors, it has a 24&quot; short scale neck (an exact replica of Cobain&#x27;s favorite neck, from a Fender Mustang).

Originally produced in 1996, after Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death, Fender Japan reissued the Jag-Stang two years after its 2001 cancellation due to popular demand. Fender once again discontinued importing the Jag-Stang from Japan as of May 2006. On July 8, 2021, Fender announced that the Jag-Stang would be reissued once again to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Nevermind, and became available to purchase in October 2021. These Jag-Stangs would be made in Mexico for the first time.

==Jag-Stang users==

Kurt Cobain is the one who recommended the idea to Fender, picking up the &quot;Jag-Stang.&quot; Cobain was the first to receive and play the guitar, which also featured a mimic of his favorite guitar neck. He used it on rare occasions. He only used the bridge pickup, a DiMarzio H-8 humbucker, that was replaced by a Seymour Duncan JB SH-4 at some time. Cobain&#x27;s Sonic Blue Jag-Stang was given to R.E.M.&#x27;s Peter Buck by Courtney Love after Cobain died. He can be seen playing it (modified for right-handed playing) in the &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; music video. Mike Mills, also from R.E.M., played this same guitar in concert during the song &quot;Let Me In&quot;, itself a tribute to Kurt Cobain. An example of this can be seen on their &quot;Road Movie&quot; DVD. TAS 1000 guitarist, Cass Picken is seen playing a Sonic Blue Jag-Stang at a TAS-A-Thon. Ruban Nielson, of the band Unknown Mortal Orchestra, uses a red Jag-Stang.

Dallon Weekes of I Dont Know How But They Found Me uses a Fender bass that appears to be modeled after the Jag-Stang&#x27;s body style. Molly Rankin of Alvvays plays a red Jag-Stang.

<text>Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza (; born 7 September 1981) is a Russian-British political activist, journalist, author, filmmaker, and former political prisoner. A protégé of murdered Russian dissident Boris Nemtsov, Kara-Murza is vice-chairman of Open Russia, an NGO founded by the exiled Russian businessman and former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, which promotes civil society and democracy in Russia. He was elected to the Coordinating Council of the Russian Opposition in 2012, and served as deputy leader of the People&#x27;s Freedom Party from 2015 to 2016. He has directed two documentaries, &quot;They Chose Freedom&quot; and &quot;Nemtsov&quot;. As of 2021, he serves as Senior Fellow to the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. He was awarded the Civil Courage Prize in 2018.

In April 2022, after speaking out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kara-Murza was arrested on charges of disobeying police orders. His arrest was extended after prosecutors introduced new charges of &quot;discrediting&quot; the military, and in October 2022 he was charged with treason. Amnesty International and others called the charges politically motivated due to his anti-war views. In October 2022, he was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize.

In April 2023, Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and was sent to a prison colony in Siberia. In 2024, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary for the columns which he continued to write from his prison cell for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. On 1 August 2024, Kara-Murza was released from prison as part of a prisoner exchange deal involving two dozen individuals from seven different countries.

==Early life and education==
Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza was born in Moscow, the son of Russian journalist and television host Vladimir Alexeyevich Kara-Murza (1959–2019), an outspoken critic of Leonid Brezhnev and supporter of reforms under Boris Yeltsin. His mother is Jewish. His father was a great grandson of Latvian revolutionary Voldemārs Bisenieks (1884–1938), and great-grand-nephew of Latvia&#x27;s first Ambassador to Great Britain, Georgs Bisenieks (1885–1941), both of whom were shot by the NKVD. The Latvian agronomist and publisher Jānis Bisenieks (1864–1923) was their older brother.

He is related to Sergey Kara-Murza (born 1939), a Soviet/Russian historian, chemist, and philosopher. He is a member of the Kara-Murza family, who are descendants of a Tatar aristocrat who settled in Moscow and converted to Christianity in the 15th century AD.

Kara-Murza earned a BA and an MA degree in history at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and he speaks fluent English. With his wife Yevgenia, he has three children.

==Career==
===Author and journalist===

Kara-Murza became a journalist at the age of 16. He worked as London correspondent for a succession of Russian media outlets, including &quot;Novye Izvestia&quot; from 1997 to 2000, from September 2000 to June 2003, and the radio station &quot;Ekho Moskvy&quot; from September 2001 to June 2003. Kara-Murza then briefly became foreign affairs correspondent of &quot;Kommersant&quot; (July 2003 to April 2004) and Washington correspondent for the BBC (December 2004 to December 2005). In 2002, he was editor-in-chief of the London-based financial publication &quot;Russian Investment Review&quot;. In April 2004 he took over as the Washington bureau chief of the RTVi television network, a post he held for the next nine years. On 1 September 2012 he was dismissed from this job.

===Documentarian===
In 2005, Kara-Murza produced a four-part TV documentary, &quot;They Chose Freedom&quot;, dedicated to the history of the Soviet dissident movement. The documentary was based on interviews with Russian dissidents, including Vladimir Bukovsky, Elena Bonner and Sergei Kovalev. It was first aired in October 2005.

The documentary has since been screened at various locations in Europe and North America, with subtitles added in English. On 24 March 2014, Kara-Murza, Anne Applebaum, and Vladimir Bukovsky took part in a discussion following a London screening of the film.

===Author===
In 2011, Kara-Murza published his first book, &quot;Reform or Revolution: The Quest for Responsible Government in the First Russian State Duma&quot; (in Russian only), which recounts the unsuccessful attempt by the Cadets or Constitutional Democratic Party to form a government during the brief existence of the first Russian Parliament or Duma from April to July 1906. Based on the original 1906 parliamentary record and contemporary newspaper reports, as well as memoirs by participants of the events, the book was launched in both Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

In late 2014 and early 2015, he wrote about a number of anti-democratic trends in Russia. President Vladimir Putin, for example, had resumed the Soviet practice of stripping dissidents of their Russian citizenship. As a result of this and other acts, Kara-Murza urged the Council of Europe not to restore Russia&#x27;s voting rights, suspended since the annexation of Crimea. Kremlin SWAT teams, he wrote in December 2014, were breaking up opposition meetings. Putin&#x27;s word was therefore &quot;void of value&quot;, wrote Kara-Murza, citing as evidence the false statements made by the Russian President and his broken promises.

Putin soft-pedaled his response to the opposition during the Sochi Olympics, Kara-Murza wrote in an op-ed for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, published on 26 February 2014. Now that the international event was over, the Russian president was rapidly returning to his former oppressive behaviour. Only hours after the closing ceremony in Sochi, a Moscow court handed prison sentences to seven of the May 2012 Bolotnaya Square protestors.

Pressure was brought to bear not only within Russia. Russia&#x27;s nationwide TV had been broadcasting &quot;hate-filled appeals to crush the protesters in Kiev&quot; for several weeks early in 2014, noted Kara-Murza. For Putin, he explained, &quot;maintaining the status quo in Ukraine was not primarily about preserving a post-Soviet sphere of influence or recreating a Moscow-led empire&quot;. The Russian president feared that &quot;a democratic, pro-European Ukraine&quot; would set &quot;a &#x27;dangerous&#x27; precedent for Russia&quot; and that it would be &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before Russian citizens began to demand similar levels of political and economic freedom.

===Russian politics===
From 1999 to 2001, Kara-Murza was a member of the Democratic Choice of Russia party; from 2001 to 2008 he was a member of the Union of Right Forces. Between 2000 and 2003 he served as an advisor to State Duma opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. He has been in opposition to Vladimir Putin since 2000, backing liberal candidate Grigory Yavlinsky in the 2000 presidential election.

Kara-Murza was a candidate for election to the Russian parliament, or State Duma, in the 2003 parliamentary election, running in Moscow&#x27;s Chertanovsky district. His candidacy was endorsed jointly by the Union of Right Forces and Yabloko. During the campaign, various underhanded methods were used against Kara-Murza. The candidate from the United Russia ruling party Vladimir Gruzdev attempted to have him removed from the ballot; the lighting on Kara-Murza&#x27;s campaign billboards and the sound during his televised debates were turned off; and unlawful carousel voting was discovered on election day. British journalist Andrew Jack named the Chertanovsky district in south Moscow as a case of electoral manipulation in Russia&#x27;s 2003 vote in his book &quot;Inside Putin&#x27;s Russia&quot;. According to the official results, Gruzdev received 149,069 votes (53.8%); Kara-Murza, 23,800 votes (8.6%); and Communist Party candidate Sergei Seregin, 18,992 votes (6.9%).

In January 2004, he co-founded the Committee 2008, an umbrella opposition group led by Boris Nemtsov and Garry Kasparov. In May 2007, Kara-Murza nominated the veteran human rights activist and writer Vladimir Bukovsky as a democratic opposition candidate for the Russian presidency in the 2008 election. &quot;The opposition needs a candidate for president – strong, uncompromising, decisive, with irreproachable political and, more importantly, moral authority,&quot; read the statement written by Kara-Murza on behalf of Bukovsky&#x27;s campaign committee. &quot;Russia needs its own Vaclav Havel, not a new successor from [the KGB].&quot;

From May to December 2007, Kara-Murza chaired Bukovsky&#x27;s campaign committee, which included, among others, Academician Yuri Ryzhov, writer and satirist Victor Shenderovich, columnist Andrei Piontkovsky, lawyer Yuri Schmidt, human rights activist Alexander Podrabinek, and political analyst Vladimir Pribylovsky. In October 2007, Kara-Murza was one of organisers of the &quot;Rally of Free People&quot; held on Moscow&#x27;s Triumfalnaya Square in support of Bukovsky&#x27;s presidential nomination.

On 16 December 2007, Bukovsky was duly nominated as a presidential candidate by 823 members of a voters&#x27; assembly in Moscow (the law required at least 500 people to support such a nomination). At the same meeting, Kara-Murza was elected as Bukovsky&#x27;s plenipotentiary representative to Russia&#x27;s Central Electoral Commission. On 22 December 2007 the Commission refused to register Bukovsky as a candidate for the presidency, thereby denying Bukovsky access to the ballot.

At the founding convention of Solidarnost, Russia&#x27;s united democratic movement, in December 2008, Kara-Murza was elected to the movement&#x27;s federal council, placing second out of 77 candidates, behind Nemtsov. He was re-elected to the Solidarnost council in 2010 and 2013.

In 2012, he took part in the street protests in Moscow against Putin&#x27;s rule, the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in Russia since 1991.

In June 2012, Kara-Murza was elected to the federal council of the Republican Party of Russia – People&#x27;s Freedom Party, co-chaired by Boris Nemtsov, Mikhail Kasyanov, and Vladimir Ryzhkov. In October 2012, he was elected to the Coordinating Council of the Russian Opposition, placing 21st out of 169 candidates and receiving 20,845 votes.

===Institute of Modern Russia===
Soon after, on 1 November 2012, Kara-Murza was hired by the Institute of Modern Russia as the organisation&#x27;s senior policy advisor. &quot;It is an honor for me to join this distinguished institute and contribute to its mission of keeping the spotlight on the situation in Russia and advocating for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law&quot;, said Kara-Murza, &quot;These values should remain at the forefront of international relations.&quot; In February 2013, he took part in panel discussions about Russia&#x27;s future at The Heritage Foundation. In October 2013, with Pavel Khodorkovsky, son of the former entrepreneur and philanthropist Mikhail Khodorkovsky and others, he participated in a similar discussion hosted by the National Endowment for Democracy.

===Open Russia===
Kara-Murza is a coordinator of the Open Russia Foundation, founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The organisation was created with the goal of promoting civil society and democracy in Russia, while revoking Putin&#x27;s grip on power. Launched in 2014, Open Russia has been instrumental in educating Russian citizens on western democracy, whilst bringing opposition groups and activists in contact with support from the west. Kara-Murza is deputy chairman and heads Open elections project designed to promote free and fair elections in Russia; a task he has noted is exceedingly difficult given the government&#x27;s ability to silence opposition and manipulate elections. He also frequently addresses international stages to promote further cooperation and discussion among nations.

===Funeral pallbearer for John McCain===
In April 2018, United States Senator John McCain sent Kara-Murza a message revealing that McCain had been diagnosed with brain cancer and requesting that Kara-Murza, who had worked with McCain on issues relating to Russia since 2010, serve as a pallbearer at the senator&#x27;s eventual funeral. Kara-Murza later said that he was &quot;speechless&quot;, &quot;heartbroken&quot;, and &quot;close to tears&quot;, and that doing so would be &quot;the most heartbreaking honor that anyone could think of&quot;. McCain died on 25 August; Kara-Murza joined fourteen others chosen by McCain himself, including then-former Vice President Joe Biden and actor Warren Beatty, as a pallbearer at McCain&#x27;s funeral at the Washington National Cathedral on 1 September. McCain&#x27;s choice of Kara-Murza was described by &quot;Politico&quot; as a &quot;final dig&quot; at Putin, of whom McCain was a vocal critic, and at U.S. President Donald Trump, for his apparent closeness to the Russian president.

==Magnitsky Act==
As a journalist who was fluent in English and based partly in the U.S., Kara-Murza played a role in the events that led to the 2012 passage of the Magnitsky Act by the U.S. Congress.

In July 2012, Kara-Murza reported that he had been denied access a few days earlier to the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. This decision was taken on the orders of the ambassador himself on the grounds that Kara-Murza was &quot;no longer a journalist&quot;. On 1 September 2012, Kara-Murza dismissal as Washington bureau chief of RTVi was made public. According to several sources, he was now on a &quot;blacklist&quot; and could not be employed as a journalist by any Russian media outlets. The reason for this ban was his advocacy of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, then being considered by the U.S. Congress.

The draft law was named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Moscow tax advisor who uncovered a massive tax-fraud scheme involving several law-enforcement officials and who died in custody of those same officials in 2009 after being tortured and denied medical care. Its purpose was to prevent the issuing of U.S. visas to persons &quot;responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky&quot;, (and for &quot;extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights&quot; in Russia) and to freeze access to any U.S.-based assets those persons might hold. The law also extended to cover Russian officials involved in broader acts of corruption and in violations of basic civil liberties. Kara-Murza explained his support for the law by saying that &quot;The prospect of losing access to the West and its financial systems...may well be, for now, the only serious disincentive to corruption and human rights violations by Russian officials.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The National Interest&quot;, Mark Adomanis warned that the Magnitsky law came with a cost. It had &quot;potential downsides,&quot; and was worsening &quot;Russia&#x27;s already precarious human-rights situation&quot;, driving &quot;some of the ever-dwindling number of effective opposition journalists&quot; from the country. In particular he cited the firing of Kara-Murza, although the journalist&#x27;s employers described his dismissal as part of &quot;a long-planned reorganization&quot;. Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, reported Adomanis, &quot;suggested the decision to fire Kara-Murza may have come from an extremely high-ranking official: Alexei Gromov, the deputy head of the presidential administration.&quot; An article in July by Peter Baker of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was devoted largely to the arguments of the law&#x27;s critics. He did quote Kara-Murza&#x27;s comment that the bill would hit corrupt officials and human-rights violators &quot;where it hurts, closing access to their ill-gotten gains in the West.&quot;

On 25 July 2012, Kara-Murza testified before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the U.S. Congress about human-rights abuses in Russia and described the proposed Magnitsky Law as &quot;a pro-Russian bill which provides a much-needed measure of accountability for those who continue to violate the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens.&quot; He added: &quot;The Kremlin&#x27;s reaction to this legislation shows that it hits them precisely where it hurts. I want to take this opportunity to thank Co-Chairmen McGovern and Wolf for their leadership on this issue. I hope the Magnitsky Act is signed into law before the end of this year.&quot; In a December 2012 article co-written with Nemtsov, Kara-Murza reiterated his support for the Magnitsky Act which he and Nemtsov called &quot;a pro-Russian law that strikes at the heart of the Kremlin&#x27;s mafia-like system&quot;, adding that &quot;Russian opposition and civil society leaders and cultural figures, as well as a plurality of Russian citizens, are in favour of the Magnitsky law.&quot;

On 12 December 2012, the Magnitsky Act became United States law.

Kara-Murza and Nemtsov called on Canada to pass a similar piece of legislation, then under consideration by the International Human Rights Subcommittee of the Canadian parliament&#x27;s House of Commons. Writing for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in December 2012, Michael Petrou reported Kara-Murza&#x27;s visit to Ottawa to urge the passage of the proposed Canadian version of the Magnitsky law, a private member&#x27;s bill introduced by Liberal MP Irwin Cotler: while it was the task of Russian opposition leaders, not foreigners, &quot;to bring democratic change to Russia,&quot; Kara-Murza said, Western democracies could still help the cause of Russian democracy through legislation. Those in Russia who had abused and tormented Magnitsky &quot;rule in the style of Zimbabwe or Belarus,&quot; wrote Petrou, paraphrasing Kara-Murza, &quot;but prefer the West as a safe place to store their money, buy second homes, and send their children to school. And it is in the West where they are most vulnerable.&quot;

In June 2013, in an interview with France 24 television, Kara-Murza discussed the proposed version of the Magnitsky law then being debated in the European Parliament. He spoke in favour of such laws, and noted that the list of persons covered by the U.S. law was being expanded. He distinguished between those in the European Parliament who were &quot;friends of Russia&quot; and those who were &quot;friends of Putin&quot;.

In March 2014, noting that the average Russian opposes intervention in Ukraine by the government of Vladimir Putin, Kara-Murza stated that the world &quot;should respond to Putin&#x27;s aggression&quot; by imposing sanctions against its perpetrators. He called for the list of Russian human-rights abusers who were already banned, under the Sergei Magnitsky Act, from travelling to the United States and keeping assets there to &quot;be dramatically expanded to include senior Kremlin officials responsible for the attack on Ukraine and the crackdown against Russian citizens.&quot; He also expressed the hope that &quot;the European Union would soon follow with its own version of the Magnitsky sanctions.&quot; &quot;Those who commit acts of aggression and abuse the rights of their own citizens should not be entitled to the privileges and comfort of the democratic West,&quot; he said.

===List of state-employed journalists===

On 27 February 2015, opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was assassinated by four shots from behind while he was sitting on a bridge near Red Square in Moscow. According to Bill Browder, Kara-Murza is a protégé of Nemtsov.

In late April 2015, Kara-Murza and Mikhail Kasyanov presented a list of eight names to members of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the US Congress. These were the TV presenters and other state-employed journalists and commentators who, Kara-Murza and Kasyanov alleged, had created an atmosphere of &quot;hatred, intolerance and violence&quot; around the figure of Nemtsov in the months leading up to his murder one hundred yards from the Kremlin. Specifically, the named individuals had stated on nationwide television that Nemtsov was a traitor, an enemy of Russia, part of a &quot;fifth column&quot; within the country, and that he would have welcomed the invading German forces outside Moscow in 1941.

Kara-Murza explained the appeal to U.S. legislators by saying that Russia&#x27;s law-enforcement agencies, unfortunately, had declined to investigate these recorded and documented statements although incitement to harm an individual was also a crime according to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. These eight names, Kara-Murza hoped, would now be added to those already on the Magnitsky List. The eight names were listed in the daily newspaper.

On 18 May 2015, the daily newspaper &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; reported that Yevgeny Alexeyevich Fyodorov, a State Duma deputy for United Russia, had requested the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to assess whether Kasyanov and Kara-Murza had not committed an act of treason, under Article 275 of the RF Criminal Code, by submitting the above list of eight names to members of the US Congress. When approached by the newspaper the Investigative Committee would not pass comment on deputy Fyodorov&#x27;s statement.

==Poisonings==
===2015===
On 26 May 2015, Kara-Murza was suddenly taken ill in Moscow during a meeting. He had eaten lunch at a restaurant and then had a two-hour meeting, during which he consumed nothing and felt normal, before becoming ill over a ten to fifteen minute period, leading to vomiting. At first he was thought to be having heart difficulties, but treatment at a specialised cardiac clinic did nothing to arrest the symptoms. Kara-Murza was then taken to hospital in Moscow. Initial symptoms indicated that he could have been poisoned, according to doctors, and he was later diagnosed with kidney failure.

Coming after the murder of his colleague Boris Nemtsov on 27 February 2015, and mindful of other cases of poisoning, both in Russia (journalist and Duma deputy Yuri Shchekochikhin in 2003, the attempted murder of Anna Politkovskaya in 2004) and abroad (Alexander Litvinenko in October 2006) there was great concern on the part of friends and family. His wife Yevgenia urged that he be evacuated from Russia for examination and treatment abroad. On 2 June, it was announced by a spokesman for the Republican Party of Russia – People&#x27;s Freedom Party that Kara-Murza had emerged from his coma and recognised his wife, who was now by his bedside. The cause of his sudden illness remained a mystery, but in an interview with the BBC his father commented, &quot;if someone did want to frighten us, then they succeeded.&quot; There has never been any conclusive evidence that Kara-Murza has ever been intentionally poisoned.

After his release from the hospital, Kara-Murza stated that it was difficult to &quot;believe this was an accident&quot;, suspecting it was an intentional poisoning, but noted there was no way to be certain. On 15 August 2015, Mikhail Khodorkovsky commented with delight that Kara-Murza had returned to work co-ordinating the Open Elections project. Kara-Murza is working to provide free and fair elections for the Duma.

===2017===

On 2 February 2017, Kara-Murza was again hospitalised after the onset of the same symptoms as his prior illness. He was put in a medically-induced coma and was on life support. He was treated at the same hospital by the same medical team who had already saved his life in 2015. According to his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov, Kara-Murza was diagnosed by the hospital with &#x27;toxic influence of an unknown substance&#x27;. He was released on 19 February and went abroad for rehabilitation. His lawyer sent the Russian Investigative Committee a request to open a criminal case into the alleged poisoning. A similar request after the 2015 incident had been turned down without an explanation.
His blood samples were provided to a number of laboratories including one affiliated to the FBI. But for unclear reasons, the FBI subsequently have not revealed details of their investigations into the substance that triggered Kara-Murza&#x27;s illness, with one US Senator suggesting that it might be &quot;classified&quot;. Two other labs—in France and Israel—have also conducted tests, but they were inconclusive.

In February 2021, a Bellingcat joint investigation with &quot;The Insider&quot; and &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; said that Kara-Murza had been followed by the same FSB unit that allegedly poisoned Alexei Navalny before he fell ill in 2015 and 2017.

==Opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and prosecution for treason==
On Monday 11 April 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kara-Murza was arrested outside his house in Russia on charges of disobeying police orders, and faced up to 15 days in jail or a small fine. It was not immediately clear if Kara-Murza’s arrest was linked to his opposition to Russia’s actions in Ukraine.
The arrest came hours after he had referred to the Putin government as &quot;a regime of murderers&quot;.

On 22 April 2022, Kara-Murza was charged by a Russian court for allegedly spreading false information about the Russian military. The criminal case against Kara-Murza was a result of his March 15th speech to the Arizona House of Representatives, in which he denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In July, new charges of cooperating with an &quot;undesirable&quot; foreign NGO were introduced, for which he faced up to six years in prison. In October, Vadim Prokhorov, one of his lawyers, said that Kara-Murza had also been charged with treason, which could lead to 20 years in prison.

In October 2022, Kara-Murza was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

In April 2023, one of Kara-Murza&#x27;s lawyers said that Russian prosecutors had asked for a 25-year prison sentence, the maximum possible. Additionally, the prosecution also asked for the sentence to be served in a &quot;strict regime&quot; prison colony where conditions are harsh, and where prisoners are held in locked cells rather than barracks. On 17 April 2023, he was convicted on charges of treason and &quot;spreading disinformation&quot; about the Russian military, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The sentence of 25 years was a combination of sentences under three articles of the Russian Criminal Code – seven years in the case of &quot;military fakes&quot;, three years in the case of participation in the activities of an &quot;undesirable&quot; organization, and 18 years in the case of treason. The sentence was the longest given to an opposition figure since the start of the war in Ukraine. By comparison, the maximum term for murder and rape in Russia is 15 years. Kara-Murza&#x27;s conviction is the longest sentence for political activity since the fall of the Soviet Union, and the length of the sentence is comparable only to Stalin&#x27;s purges in the 1930s.

Kara-Murza compared his case to show trials from the Stalin era. In his closing speech before the court, he said: &quot;I know that the day will come when the darkness over our country will be gone. When the war [in Ukraine] will be called a war, and the usurper [in the Kremlin] will be called a usurper; when those who have ignited this war will be called criminals instead of those who tried to stop it... And then our people will open their eyes and shudder at the sight of the horrific crimes committed in their names.&quot; Following his conviction, Kara-Murza was transferred from Moscow to IK-6, a maximum security prison in Siberia, and was immediately placed in a &quot;punishment cell&quot;.

On 29 January 2024, it was reported that Kara-Murza had disappeared after prison authorities informed his lawyers that he was no longer held at IK-6. British foreign secretary David Cameron demanded that Russia account for Kara-Murza&#x27;s whereabouts. It later emerged that Kara-Murza had been transferred to solitary confinement at a harsher facility, IK-7, for supposed breaches of prison rules. In a letter disclosed to the media, Kara-Murza suggested that his transfer was because he had become &quot;too comfortable&quot; at IK-6.

==Release as part of prisoner exchange deal==
On 1 August 2024, Kara-Murza was one of sixteen prisoners held in Russia who were pardoned and released as part of the 2024 Russian prisoner exchange. Kara-Murza and the others were flown to Ankara Esenboğa Airport in Turkey, where they were exchanged for eight Russians who had been imprisoned in several Western countries. David Lammy, who had replaced Cameron as UK foreign secretary, welcomed the releases of Kara-Murza and Paul Whelan, stating that Kara-Murza had been &quot;imprisoned in life-threatening conditions because he courageously told the truth about the war in Ukraine&quot;.

==Post release activity==

On 3 September 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Mongolia, where he was welcomed with a red carpet reception despite an ICC arrest warrant related to alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Kara-Murza signed an open letter urging Mongolia to &quot;immediately detain Vladimir Putin upon his arrival.&quot; Due to Mongolia being a signatory of the Rome Statute of the ICC, Putin could be placed under arrest by the Mongolian authorities if he sets foot on Mongolian territory.

<text>The Lions of Al-Rassan is a historical fantasy novel by Canadian writer Guy Gavriel Kay. It is set in a peninsula of the same world in which &quot;The Sarantine Mosaic&quot; and &quot;The Last Light of the Sun&quot; are set, and is based on Moorish Spain. The novel concentrates on the relationships between the three peoples: the Kindath (analogous to the Jews), the Asharites (analogous to the Muslims), and the Jaddites (analogous to the Christians), although the religions of the Kindath, Asharites, and Jaddites, as described in the novel, bear no relation to Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.

The three protagonists in the novel are from each of these three races and religions: Jehane bet Ishak, a Kindath physician in Fezana (loosely based on Rebecca of York); Rodrigo Belmonte, a Jaddite captain of a company of cavalry (loosely based on El Cid); and Ammar ibn Khairan, an Asharite poet, mercenary, and advisor to King Almalik of Cartada (loosely based on Muhammad ibn Ammar).

==Synopsis==

===Premise===

Three major religions exist in the peninsula in which the story is set. Jaddites and Asharites are the largest groups; the Kindath are a smaller group which is often persecuted and owns minimal territory.

The peninsula now known as Al-Rassan was formerly known as Esperaña when under Jaddite control. The land is split between three Jaddite kingdoms in the north (Valledo, Ruenda, and Jaloña) and several Asharite city-states in the south, of which Cartada and Ragosa figure most prominently in the story. After centuries of being dominated by the Asharites, the Jaddite kingdoms are regaining their strength, while the once-powerful caliphate of Al-Rassan is divided and vulnerable.

Fifteen years prior to the events of the main story, Ammar ibn Khairan assassinated the last Caliph of Esperaña on the orders of Almalik I of Cartada.

===Plot===

The city of Fezana lies in the north of Al-Rassan. It pays parias to the Jaddite kingdom of Valledo. King Almalik I of Cartada organizes a purge of the wealthy citizens of Fezana to be blamed on his longtime courtier Ammar ibn Khairan. Jehane bet Ishak, a physician in Fezana, unwittingly saves one of her patients from the purge.

Ammar joins forces with the heir to Cartada, also called Almalik, and assassinates Almalik I. The new king Almalik II takes the throne and promptly exiles Ammar. Ammar travels to Ragosa, accompanying the former concubine of Almalik I, Zabira. Zabira hopes to overthrow Almalik II and install her own son on the throne of Cartada.

Meanwhile, a group of Valledans brutally attacks a village outside the walls of Fezana. Jaddite Captain Rodrigo Belmonte halts the slaughter, leading to the death of a member of the powerful Derrada family. As a result, Rodrigo is exiled by King Ramiro of Valledo. Rodrigo and Jehane also make their way to Ragosa.

Rodrigo, Ammar, and Jehane meet in the court of King Badir of Ragosa. Ammar and Rodrigo are hired as mercenaries, and Jehane as a physician. Zabira asks Badir to support her son’s claim to the throne of Cartada. Badir eventually agrees to go to war against Cartada. As the story progresses, Jehane develops a platonic friendship with Rodrigo and a romance with Ammar. Ammar and Rodrigo also befriend one another despite their different religions and cultures.

The Jaddites begin a holy war against the Asharite city-states, in a rough parallel to the Crusades. To the south of Al-Rassan, in the Majriti Desert, the Muwardis practice a stricter version of the Asharite religion. The brother of Almalik II convinces the Muwardis to intervene in the affairs of Al-Rassan, both to repel the Jaddites and to cleanse the Asharite lands of their impious leaders.

Unrest in Fezana leads to a massacre of Kindath citizens. Jehane, Ammar, and Rodrigo arrive in Fezana in time to rescue Jehane’s parents. Outside the city, they meet King Ramiro. A Muwardi ambush injures Diego, the son of Rodrigo Belmonte. Jehane’s father performs emergency surgery to save his life.

King Ramiro proposes to begin a conquest of not only the Asharite city-states, but also of the other two Jaddite kingdoms. He hopes to form a united Esperañan government over the whole peninsula. Rodrigo Belmonte is promoted to constable of Valledo. Rodrigo offers to become co-constable with Ammar. Ammar refuses, placing his loyalty to Cartada above his friendship with Rodrigo. Ammar and Jehane leave together. Ammar becomes leader of the Cartadan army. War spreads across the peninsula. Ammar and Rodrigo face each other in single combat before a battle. One man kills the other, though the narrative does not immediately reveal which man is the victor.

In an epilogue, news arrives that Cartada has been conquered, placing the whole peninsula under Esperaña’s control. Rodrigo has been buried in a place of honor, and his epitaph is a line from Ammar’s poetry. Ammar composes a lament for the lost Al-Rassan while his wife Jehane listens.

==Major themes==
The interplay between bigotry and tolerance is a major theme of the novel. The stories of the main characters are interwoven in such a way that each is responsible for saving the lives of persons who are loved by the others. The surgery to save Diego Belmonte is seen as a key event: &quot;In this scene, the son of a Jaddite warleader is saved through an Asharite&#x27;s warning and a Kindath&#x27;s medical skill; it hints at the possibility of peaceful interaction among the three embattled religious groups.&quot; The possibility of cooperation between people of different faith is glimpsed as an ideal that leads to the miraculous, in this case an extraordinary act of surgery. It is in the Epilogue, in the Kindath city of Sorenica, rebuilt after its destruction by Jaddites at the outset of their holy war, where the possibilities of co-existence are realized.

The uses and misuses of religion for political ends are also demonstrated in the novel, with rulers and clergy using religion to manipulate the people and their leaders into desired courses of action.

The definition of civilization and the search for the attributes of a civilized society in a hard divided world is another theme of the novel. Kay characterizes the relatively liberal and tolerant Asharite city of Ragosa or the Kindath city of Sorenica as places of civilization. Silvenes, the capital of the former Khalifate of Al-Rassan, now ruined and largely abandoned, is seen wistfully as the symbol of civilization lost. In contrast, the cruder Jaddite cities of Esperaña with their increasing military power and the ascetic desert communities of the Muwardi Asharites are places with fewer of the attributes of civilization.

While Kay presents war and conquest with an air of nobility and grandeur, the novel also constantly reminds the reader of the real price of war paid in bloodshed, loss and grief.

<doc id="1119555" wikidata="Q281963" url="?curid=1119555" title="Psycho le Cému">
<text>is a Japanese visual kei rock band formed in 1999. Its members are Aya, Daishi, Lida, Seek, and Yura-sama (Yuraサマ). Psycho le Cému distinguished themselves in the visual kei scene via their cosplay, with their members dressing in colorful, extravagant outfits inspired by anime and video game characters.

Psycho le Cému&#x27;s cosplay inspired a dedicated niche fanbase, with fans who shared the band&#x27;s interest in anime and cosplay, and some releases and events were done exclusively for members of Kronos, the band&#x27;s fan club. The band creates a new set of costumes for each single. Promotional music videos often have storylines based on anime or literature. The band also performs as an alter-ego band called &quot;Bad Boys, Be Ambitious!&quot; Each Band member has their own personality in each character, as well as their own color scheme. Example: the Bassist “Seek” is usually the “monster” or “villain” of the story.

==History==
Psycho le Cému formed in early 1999, and released their first maxi-single “Kronos” independently in March 2000. After playing a sold-out gig at Tokyo&#x27;s famed visual-kei venue Rock May Kan, the band joined strong indie label Limited Records, who released their November 2000 maxi single “Risokyu Ryokou Guide Disc”. All 15 tour shows supporting this release were sold-out, including the finale at Shibuya&#x27;s On Air West.

In September 2001, Psycho le Cému released their first album, &quot;Doppelganger&quot;, and began to play nationally and in larger venues. The group was managed by visual kei specialists Sweet Heart, who have also managed Luna Sea, Shazna, La&#x27;cryma Christi, Pierrot, and Plastic Tree.

In 2003, Psycho le Cému was signed by major Japanese label Crown, and their next two singles went into the top ten of Oricon&#x27;s singles chart. In mid-2004 the band made appearances at Pacific Media Expo and Project A-kon and documented the trip in the form of the &quot;Psycho le Cému in USA Live &amp; Document&quot; DVD, which was released in September 2004. The group also kept active in Japan, among other shows they appeared later that year at a festival sponsored by Japan&#x27;s visual-kei oriented magazine Fool&#x27;s Mate. The group returned to the States in early 2005 and performed at three anime conventions: Katsucon in Arlington, Virginia, Megacon in Orlando, Florida, and in San Francisco, California.

On May 31, 2005, singer Daishi underwent a urinalysis that showed up positive for methamphetamine and was arrested by Kanagawa police. When the story broke in the media, all of the band&#x27;s merchandise was removed from shelves in Japan. Daishi&#x27;s solo tour was cancelled, and his solo EP was removed from shelves. On June 5, the band announced via their official website that they would be on hiatus due to Daishi&#x27;s arrest. On September 30, Daishi was sentenced to one year and ten months probation with a suspended sentence of three years by a court in Yokohama.

The members have formed side projects in the meantime; Aya and seek are in the band ISABELLE with three other musicians, and Lida and Yura-sama are in Dacco. They have ended their relationship with their label, Crown Records, as well as with their management, Sweet Child Entertainments, and are pursuing their projects independently. Aya was in Isabelle before Psycho le Cému formed, and re-formed the group for a tour and a live DVD in 2005. Seek and Aya are currently in the group Mix Speaker&#x27;s,Inc., and Seek is an active blogger.

In May 2006 Psycho le Cému toured to support the release of new album &quot;~Epilogue ~ Kataritsugareru Monogatari&quot;. In addition, all of the merchandise that had been pulled from store shelves was reinstated, and the &quot;Live in the USA II&quot; DVD, which was delayed due to Daishi&#x27;s arrest, was finally released. Although as soon as the tour was over, Psycho le Cému went on what seemed to be a permanent hiatus.

Daishi, now freed from jail, started a single career. On March 21, 2007, he released &quot;God Japanese Monster&quot;, his first solo album, accompanied of a Japanese tour. In 2009, the group announced, through their Ameblo blog, &quot;Psycho le Cemu will be going on a short tour to celebrate 10 years since their formation. The tour will be called 「Legend of Sword」, kicks off in June.&quot; As stated, Psycho le Cému members reunited again for the anniversary of the creation of the band with a tour called &quot;10th Anniversary - Legend of Sword&quot;, with new costumes and, the tour started in June of that year.

In 2015, Psycho le Cému reunited for three 15th anniversary concerts on February 11, 14 and 15. Later, the group announced a new single, &quot;Akiramenai Days&quot;, which was released on September 16, 2015, as well as the return of the band.

In 2017, they covered &quot;Darlin&#x27;&quot; by D&#x27;erlanger for the &quot;D&#x27;erlanger Tribute Album ~Stairway to Heaven~&quot;.

==Members==
Musicians credits&#x27; are as per the liner notes of the group&#x27;s own records. Yura-sama is always credited with vocals, although his only lead vocal spot is the song &quot;Area&quot; and &quot;Janus&quot;, which he shares with Daishi, while Lida is never credited with vocals, although he raps a verse in many songs. All members may take backing vocals. Many songs have a pre-recorded or sequenced backing track, to which Aya and Yura-sama will do choreographed dance routines with hand-movements during live performances, called &quot;furitsuke&quot; (or &quot;furi&quot; for short), which in the past have often been mistakenly referred to as para para by international fans.

<text>Charley Riley (April 22, 1922 - May 22, 1994) is an inductee of the Boxing Hall of Fame. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri and was sometimes known as &quot;Chillin&#x27; Charley&quot;.

==Career==
Charley Riley was a top featherweight boxing contender in the 1940s and 1950s. He achieved nationwide recognition in the United States with a trio of exciting fights with ex-NBA featherweight champ Phil Terranova. He lost via a one-punch body-shot knockout on February 22, 1946, but on April 30, 1947, evened the score with a 7th-round TKO of Terranova. On September 3, 1947, he scored a first-round TKO of Terranova. Reports were that the referee stopped this fight on the advice of the ring doctor because Terranova was bleeding profusely.

Riley fought Willie Pep for the featherweight championship in St Louis January 16, 1950 and was knocked out by Pep by a body punch in the fifth round. He accepted a non-title bout with reigning featherweight champion Sandy Saddler November 1, 1950 and lost a decision. He put pressure on Saddler in the first part of the fight but faded in the later rounds. During his career Riley also faced Glen Flanagan, Jackie Graves, Corky Gonzalez, George Araujo and Redtop Davis.

Riley retired in 1954 with a record of 69 wins (39 by knockout), 29 losses, and 2 draws. Although he was never a world champion, Charley Riley was inducted to &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame (disbanded in 1987).

He was also known as the &quot;Finney Avenue Fashion Plate&quot; (an avenue in St. Louis) for his attention to dress.

<text>Vladimir Alexeyevich Kara-Murza (; 24 October 1959 – 28 July 2019) was a Russian journalist and TV host.

==Biography==
Kara-Murza graduated from the history faculty of Moscow State University in 1981; while at the university, he was nearly expelled for defacing portraits of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. He taught history at school. In the 1980s, he refused state employment, citing his opposition to the Soviet regime.

In 1992, with the onset of President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s democratic reforms, he joined the weekly &quot;Itogi&quot; programme on Channel One of Russian TV—first as editor, then as correspondent. In 1993, along with his colleagues, he joined the newly created NTV, Russia&#x27;s first independent television channel founded by Vladimir Gusinsky. In April 1995, Kara-Murza became the anchor of NTV&#x27;s news programme &quot;Today at Midnight&quot;.

In April 2001, in protest at the seizure of NTV by the Russian government, Kara-Murza, along with other NTV journalists (Yevgeny Kiselyov, Viktor Shenderovich, Mikhail Osokin, Svetlana Sorokina), went to TV-6 channel, where he became anchor of the evening news programme &quot;Grani&quot; (&quot;Angles&quot; or &quot;Points of View&quot;). When TV6 was closed down by the government in January 2002, its journalists contested the competition for the frequency, and won, returning in June 2002 as TVS channel. Kara-Murza continued his &quot;Grani&quot; programme, which enjoyed some of the highest viewer ratings on Russian television.

In June 2003, TVS, Russia&#x27;s last independent television channel, was removed from the air by order of the Press Ministry. From August 2003, Kara-Murza was the evening news anchor at RTVi channel.

He was the father of opposition politician Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza.

He died on 28 July 2019 after a period of ill health where he suffered from several strokes.

== Public position ==
In 2004, he became one of the founders of the opposition Committee 2008. In 2018, he was one of the trustees of Grigory Yavlinsky in the presidential election.

He was one of the critics of the policy of the current authorities and President Vladimir Putin, and in his publications regularly criticized the programs of modern Russian television and their presenters.

<doc id="1119576" wikidata="Q2893471" url="?curid=1119576" title="Beck's Bolero">
<text>&quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; is a rock instrumental recorded by English guitarist Jeff Beck in 1966. It is Beck&#x27;s first solo recording and has been described as &quot;one of the great rock instrumentals, epic in scope, harmonically and rhythmically ambitious yet infused with primal energy&quot;. &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; features a prominent melody with multiple guitar parts propelled by a rhythm inspired by Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;.

The recording session brought together a group of musicians, including Jimmy Page, Keith Moon, John Paul Jones, and Nicky Hopkins, who later agreed that the line up was a first attempt at what became Led Zeppelin. However, there is an ongoing disagreement over the composer as well as producer credits. Despite being credited solely to Page, Beck claims that he made significant contributions to the composition. Likewise, Page and Simon Napier-Bell each claim to have produced it, while Mickie Most received the credit.

&quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; was not released until ten months after recording and then only as the B-side to Beck&#x27;s first single. When it finally received greater exposure on Beck&#x27;s debut album &quot;Truth&quot; in the latter part of 1968, it was still considered quite advanced even though it was over two years old, and is considered a key early track in the development of hard rock and heavy metal. One of his favorite works, Beck continued to perform it throughout his career, and several renditions have been recorded by other musicians.

== Background ==
The recording session for &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; was conceived of as a side project for Jeff Beck while he was a member of the Yardbirds. &quot;It was decided that it would be a good idea for me to record some of my own stuff ... partly to stop me moaning about the Yardbirds&quot;, Beck recalled. Also, the Yardbirds&#x27; management was encouraging individual band members to bring attention to the band through success in solo projects. Studio time was booked for May 1966 at the IBC Studios in London. To prepare for the session, Beck called on long-time friend and studio guitarist Jimmy Page, who had recommended Beck as Eric Clapton&#x27;s replacement in the Yardbirds, to work up some ideas for songs to record.

Although there is a disagreement over credits for the composition, both Beck and Page agree that Page began by playing some chords on a twelve-string guitar using a rhythm based on &quot;Boléro&quot;. &quot;Boléro&quot; is a one-movement orchestral piece composed by Maurice Ravel in 1928 and is &quot;built on a persistent, repeating motif supported by a snare drum ... re-creating the Spanish &#x27;bolero&#x27; dance pattern for full orchestra&quot;, according to Beck biographer Martin Power. A melody line for guitar was developed along with a middle section to break up the rhythm, reminiscent of the Yardbirds&#x27; arrangements for &quot;For Your Love&quot; and &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;.

With at least the outline of one song and Page on board to play guitar, Beck approached Keith Moon of the Who, whom he considered one of his favourite drummers. Moon was unhappy with the Who at the time and readily agreed to participate. To avoid a confrontation with Pete Townshend and Kit Lambert, the Who&#x27;s manager, Moon wished to do so incognito. He recommended bandmate John Entwistle, who was similarly discontented with the Who, to provide the bass.

== Recording ==
Recording took place at IBC Studios in London on 16 and 17 May 1966. Moon arrived at the studio disguised in sunglasses and a Russian cossack hat. &quot;Moonie turned up,&quot; Beck recalled, &quot;and I never expected it, because he was so scatty, and you never knew if he was going to show. But once he was in there, we started it off and I went and heard the playback and went, &#x27;Jeez, this is the beginning of something amazing. You guys are not going anywhere.&#x27; Page on rhythm guitar, me on lead, John Paul Jones on bass – it&#x27;s done! …And to cap it all we had Glyn Johns engineering. This is the motherlode! And the next day it was all over.&quot;

When Entwistle did not show, studio musicians John Paul Jones and Nicky Hopkins were brought in at the last minute to provide bass and piano. An unsubstantiated account holds that Ritchie Blackmore may have been involved, but his participation has not been acknowledged by Beck, Page or others at the session. Simon Napier-Bell, the Yardbirds&#x27; producer who had originally promoted the idea, was present for the recording.

Beck used a Gibson Les Paul played through a Vox AC30 amplifier and Page played a Fender Electric XII twelve-string electric guitar. Halfway through the song, Moon smashed the drum microphone with his stick; &quot;You can actually hear him screaming as he does it,&quot; Beck remembered, &quot;so all you can hear from then on is cymbals!&quot; After Moon and Napier-Bell left, Beck and Page added overdubs and sound treatments to complete the track. According to Beck, two or three songs were recorded at the session, but &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; was the only one released.

== Composition ==
&quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; is roughly divided into three parts. The first begins with a reworking of Ravel&#x27;s two-chord progression, transposed to the key of A. Power points out that by using a 12-string guitar, Page is able to take advantage of the instrument&#x27;s &quot;rich chiming quality to emulate the distinct, orchestral &#x27;bolero&#x27; sound&quot;. Beck then introduces the melody line on electric guitar with a fuzz-tone effect producing indefinite sustain; alternating between major and minor modes, it is described as &quot;haunting&quot; by Power and as a &quot;distinctive piercing, sinister tone&quot; by critic Richie Unterberger. In the second section, the piano, bass, and drums come in and the tension builds. Unterberger describes the third section as &quot;suddenly set[ting] off from the main motif into a beautiful serene section highlighting slide-glissando guitars&quot;, with Beck&#x27;s echo-laden slide sounding similar to a steel guitar. The fourth section returns to the main melody with overlaid drawn-out descending slide. According to Beck, &quot;the phasing was Jimmy&#x27;s idea ... I played a load of waffle and he reversed it&quot;. The tension mounts as Moon adds drum flourishes, climaxing with a break.

The second part begins with Moon&#x27;s simultaneous drum break and scream and launches in a hard rock direction. &quot;It was my idea to cut off in the middle, Yardbirds-style&quot;, Beck commented, &quot;Keith upped the tempo and gave it an extra kick. It&#x27;s like a bit of the Who, a bit of the Yardbirds and a bit of me&quot;. The amply-distorted guitar provides &quot;a thick-toned, descending riff&quot;, according to Power. He also describes the break, inspired by the Yardbirds&#x27; rave-up technique, as &quot;eerily presag[ing] the coming era of hard rock and heavy metal&quot;. The third part returns to the main motif with added guitar fills. The melody line is abandoned in the second section and replaced with multiple interwoven takes of guitar effects, including phasing, echo, and controlled feedback. It concludes with a few bars of hard blues rock-style lead guitar and an abrupt ending.

== Releases ==

The record release of &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; was delayed for ten months, when Jeff Beck began his solo career after leaving the Yardbirds. It appeared as the B-side of his first single, &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot;, which was released on 10 March 1967 in the UK (Columbia DB 8151) and 3 April 1967 in the US (Epic 5–10157). The initial UK pressing of the single listed the title as &quot;Bolero&quot; with Jeff Beck as the composer, while later pressings showed &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; and &quot;J. Page&quot;. The single reached number fourteen in the UK Singles Chart, and number 123 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot; was ignored by American underground FM radio, but &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; became a staple of the new radio format.

In 1968, the instrumental gained wider exposure when it was included on the Jeff Beck Group debut album, &quot;Truth&quot;. Released in the US in July, the album reached number 15 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart one month later. &quot;Truth&quot; was issued in October in the UK, but it did not appear in the album charts. On the British monaural releases, &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; has a fifteen-second backwards guitar coda. This version is included as a bonus track on the 2006 remastered &quot;Truth&quot; CD and on the Sundazed Music reissue of the original mono vinyl album. The original album liner notes do not list the personnel for &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; – Jones&#x27; and Hopkins&#x27; contributions are noted for other songs along with &quot;Timpani by &#x27;You Know Who&#x27;&quot;, the &quot;Who&quot; being Moon.

&quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; remained one of Beck&#x27;s favourite pieces and he performed it numerous times, often as his opening number. A live version in 2008 appears on his &quot;Live at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s&quot; album and video. On 4 April 2009, Page formally inducted Beck into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and together they performed &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; at the induction ceremony, with Page playing the original 1965 Fender XII guitar he used for the 1966 recording session.

== Disagreement over credits ==

=== Production ===
Beck&#x27;s later producer, Mickie Most, the Yardbirds&#x27; producer, Simon Napier-Bell, and Jimmy Page have each claimed to be the recording&#x27;s producer. At the time of the release of &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot;, Beck was under contract to Most. Although he was not involved in the recording, under the terms of the contract, Most received a &quot;mandated production credit&quot; and it is his name that appears on the single and album credits. Napier-Bell, who was at least present for the recording, has claimed that his involvement was substantial:

However, according to Jimmy Page, &quot;the track was done and then the producer, Simon Napier-Bell, just disappeared ... [he] just sort of left me and Jeff to do it. Jeff was playing and I was [at the recording console].&quot; Page asserts that he in fact was the instrumental&#x27;s actual producer. In an interview before its release and his involvement with Most, Beck commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve got an example of my production together with Jimmy Page and it&#x27;s an instrumental&quot;, but does not mention Napier-Bell.

=== Composition ===
The initial Columbia Records pressing of the single listed the title as &quot;Bolero&quot; and &quot;Jeff Beck&quot; as the composer. However, Jimmy Page filed for the composer credit for &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; and it is his name that appears on the credits for all but the initial release. Nonetheless, Beck has claimed credit for his contributions to the composition. Both Beck and Page agree that Page came up with the &quot;Boléro&quot;-influenced chords and rhythm. However, Beck specifically claims that key features of the instrumental—the haunting melody line and the second part &quot;hard-rock&quot; break—are his. Beck adds that the break contains &quot;the first heavy metal riff ever written and I wrote it&quot;. While not addressing the specifics, Page asserts &quot;I wrote it, played on it, produced it ... and I don&#x27;t give a damn what [Jeff] says. That&#x27;s the truth&quot;, but adds &quot;the slide bits are his&quot;. Beck later put it behind him: &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t get a songwriting credit, but you win some and lose some down the years&quot;. Over the years, he and Page have made several appearances together in concerts and for interviews.

== Legacy ==
Beck, Page, Hopkins, Jones, and Moon were pleased with the outcome of the recording session and there was talk of forming a working group and additional recordings. This led to the famous quip, &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;ll go down like a lead zeppelin&quot;, which Page later used, with a slight spelling change, for his new group. Page ascribed it to Moon, while Beck&#x27;s and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s later manager Peter Grant claimed Moon used the phrase &quot;go down like a lead balloon&quot;, to which Entwistle added &quot;more like a lead zeppelin&quot;. Group biographer Keith Shadwick notes that forming an actual group at the time &quot;was never a realistic option&quot;, due to existing contractual obligations.
For all their attempts at secrecy, Townshend learned of Moon&#x27;s move. Beck recalled, &quot;I remember [Pete] Townshend looking daggers at me when he heard it ... because it was a bit near the mark. He didn&#x27;t want anybody meddling with that territory [his band, the Who] at all&quot;. Townshend also took to referring to Beck and Page as &quot;flashy little guitarists of very little brain&quot; for their perceived subterfuge (Page responded with &quot;Townshend got into feedback because he couldn&#x27;t play single notes&quot;). In a later interview, Townshend explained

Differences with Moon were resolved and he returned to the Who shortly after the recording. One month later, Page joined the Yardbirds and together with Beck became one of the first dual-lead guitar teams in popular rock. In 1968, Hopkins became a member of the Jeff Beck Group and for performances of &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; during their first US tour in June, singer Rod Stewart played the rhythm guitar part. Also in 1968, Page started Led Zeppelin with Jones. Page incorporated some of the melody line and bolero rhythm into the medley portion of &quot;How Many More Times&quot; for the &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; debut album.

&quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; appears on various &quot;best of&quot; lists and in &quot;Guitar Masters: Intimate Portraits&quot;, Alan di Perna describes it as &quot;one of the great rock instrumentals, epic in scope, harmonically and rhythmically ambitious yet infused with primal energy&quot;. The May 1966 recording pre-dated other mid-1960s hard rock/psychedelic rock milestones, such as the formation of Cream, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s arrival in England, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; album, and the rise of the San Francisco Sound. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield recalled that &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; had a &quot;significant impact on Jimi Hendrix, who named it among his favorite tracks&quot;. Beck recalled performing a live version with Hendrix on lead guitar, but a recording has not been forthcoming.

According to Paul Hornsby, who played with Duane Allman in Hour Glass in 1967–1968 before the Allman Brothers Band, &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; inspired Allman to take up slide guitar. After hearing Beck&#x27;s record, Allman &quot;loved that slide part and told me he was going to learn to play it&quot;, Hornsby recalled. In 1970, Joe Walsh adapted the slide-guitar section of &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; for a James Gang song. Titled &quot;The Bomber&quot;, the multi-part suite also includes a rendition of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; and appears on the &quot;James Gang Rides Again&quot; album.

<text>Bachman–Turner Overdrive is the self-titled debut studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, released in 1973. It was originally to be titled &quot;Brave Belt III&quot;, following the &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; album, made by the previous line-up of the group, called Brave Belt.

The album did not produce a true hit single (&quot;Blue Collar&quot; reached #68 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and #21 in Canada), but it was certified &quot;Gold&quot; by the RIAA in 1974, largely pulled up by strong sales of Bachman–Turner Overdrive&#x27;s next two albums (&quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot; and &quot;Not Fragile&quot;). &quot;Gimme Your Money Please&quot; and &quot;Little Gandy Dancer&quot; were released on a double A-side single in Canada only. After the release of &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot;, this first album was often referred to as &quot;BTO 1&quot;.

<text>Amalio Rafael Carreño Adrián (born April 11, 1964) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball right-handed relief pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies. In his &quot;cup of coffee&quot; big league career, Carreño had a 0–0 record, with two strikeouts, and a 16.20 earned run average (ERA), in innings pitched.

==Career==
Carreño started his professional career with the New York Yankees, who signed him as an amateur free agent in 1983. He spent the 1984 season with the GCL Yankees, the minor league rookie affiliate of the Yankees. He pitched in nine games and started in seven of them, winning one game, losing six, and finishing with an ERA of 4.91. He pitched in one game the following season, and in 1986 split time between the GCL and Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League. After seven games with GCL, going 5–0 with a 1.70 ERA, Carreño was promoted to Fort Lauderdale, where he pitched in three games, winning one and losing one.

In 1987, Carreño pitched for three teams in the Yankees organization: the Prince William Yankees, the Albany-Colonie Yankees, and the Columbus Clippers. He spent the first part of the season with Prince William, then was promoted to Columbus, where his outings included two shutout innings at the AAA level. After 11 appearances with Columbus, he was sent back to Prince William, pitching a complete game in his return appearance. He finished his time at Prince William with a 5–2 record and a 3.03 ERA. Late in the season, he was promoted to Albany-Colonie and spent the rest of the season there. In November, the Yankees purchased Carreño&#x27;s contract and placed him on the 40-man roster.

At the start of the 1988 season, the Yankees signed Carreño to a one-year contract and invited him to spring training. After pitching with the Yankees in March, he was sent along with Clay Parker to Albany-Colonie. He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on July 15, 1988, for Luis Aguayo. Carreño finished the season with three wins, four losses, and a 4.07 ERA in 14 appearances. He remained with the Reading Phillies for the following two years. In 1989, he pitched in 31 games, starting 11, and had a 4.34 ERA and 5–7 record. He was invited to spring training for the Phillies, but was unable to do so after missing a flight out of Venezuela. He was sent to Reading after spring training ended, and moved into the starting rotation for them. On August 25, Carreño was on the losing side of a perfect game thrown by Kevin Morton, losing the game 1–0. He finished the season with a 4–13 record and a 3.66 ERA in 23 starts.

After being re-signed by Philadelphia in 1991, Carreño started the season with the AAA-level Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons. After spending the first three months of the season with the Red Barons, the Phillies placed Roger McDowell on the disabled list and called Carreño up to the major league roster. He made his major league debut on July 7, along with Tim Mauser against the New York Mets, then made two more appearances. In his final appearance on July 14, he was ejected when he struck Steve Decker with a pitch after being warned not to. He was sent back down to Scranton the next day, and finished the season with them. In 33 games, Carreño had four wins, eight losses, and a 5.33 ERA.

At the end of the 1991 season, Carreño became a free agent. He signed with the Baltimore Orioles in January 1992, and participated in spring training with them. He did not earn a spot on the roster, and his professional baseball career was over.

<doc id="1119587" wikidata="Q1225498" url="?curid=1119587" title="Dilgo Khyentse">
<text>Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Tashi Paljor () (c. 1910 – 28 September 1991) was a Vajrayana master, Terton, scholar, poet, teacher, and recognized by Buddhists as one of the greatest realized masters. Head of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism from 1988 to 1991, he is also considered an eminent proponent of the Rime tradition.

As the primary custodian of the vast collection of teachings both authored by and recovered by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Dilgo Khyentse was the &quot;de facto&quot; custodian of a vast majority of Tibetan Buddhist teachings. He taught many eminent teachers, including the 14th Dalai Lama. After the Chinese invasion of Tibet, his personal effort was crucial in the preservation of Tibetan Buddhism.

==Biography==

===Early life, ancestry===
Dilgo Khyentse was born on the 3rd day of the 3rd lunar month of the Iron Dog Year (1910), in the Denma region of Derge, in Denkok Valley, in Kham, Eastern Tibet, during a teaching on the Kalachakra Tantra given in his house by Ju Mipham. Ju Mipham conferred the name Tashi Paljor. The Dilgo family directly descended from Tibet&#x27;s eighth-century King Trisong Detsen, and both his father and mother were children of ministers to the King of Dege, based in Derge. His family and their associates were major patrons of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. He had three brothers: the eldest brother Sanggye; another older brother who became the 9th Benchen Sanggye Nyenpa, Karma Shedrub Tenpai Nyima; and a third older brother that died at a young age.

When Dilgo Khyentse was a year old, he was declared to be a reincarnation of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo by a disciple of Khyentse Wangpo&#x27;s. Several high Rinpoches from the Nyingma, Karma Kagyu, and Sakya schools were to request Dilgo Khyentse be sent to their monasteries, but Ju Mipham advised his father to keep young Dilgo Khyentse Tashi Paljor at home.

In 1912, the 4th Shechen Gyaltsap Pema Namgyal (1871–1926) of Shechen Monastery requested Tashi Paljor for his monastery, and the request was accepted. Shechen Monastery is one of the six principal &quot;Mother Monasteries&quot; of the Nyingma school, where Dilgo Khyentse received novice vows in 1919, and where he was formally enthroned by Shechen Gyaltsab in 1925 as the tulku of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, and given the name Gyurme Tekchok Tenpai Gyeltsen.

During these years, Dilgo Khyentse travelled close to Shechen Monastery to receive teachings in Buddhist philosophy from several masters, including Shechen Kongtrul Pema Drime (1901–1960), the 11th Tai Situ, Pema Wangchok Gyelpo of Palpung Monastery where he seriously studied, from masters at Dzogchen Monastery, Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro, and Khenpo Zhenga of Jyegu Dondrub Ling at Jyekundo. Additionally, he received teachings on the ancient Guhyagarbha Tantra and its various commentaries from Khenpo Tubga at Kyangma Ritro. In all, he studied with more than 50 teachers from the Nyingma school&#x27;s oral (&quot;kama&quot;) and practice lineages within Tibetan Buddhism.

His root guru was Shechen Gyaltsap Rinpoche, and Dzongsar Khyentse Chokyi Lodro (1893–1959) was his other main spiritual master. He completed what is known as the Ngöndro, or Preliminary Practice.

His eldest brother Sanggye was his constant travelling and practice companion, and they entered many brief retreats between teachings which included the &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot;, the
&quot;Madhamikāvatāra&quot;, Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;, the 
&quot;Guhyagarbha Tantra&quot;, works by many masters including Ju Mipham, Terdak Lingpa, Mindroling, Guru Chowang, Jamgon Kongtrul, and by other great masters. His classic training would automatically include training in meditation, in the study of the Kangyur and Tengyur, and in the tantra teachings specifically. He also received training in grammar and poetics in addition to the numerous teachings, transmissions, and empowerments. He remained in close proximity to Shechen Monastery until 1926, when Shechen Gyaltsab passed.

From 1926 until 1934, Dilgo Khyentse remained in solitary retreat in a cave in Denkok, near his birthplace, but attended the enthronement of the 5th Shechen Gyeltsab at Shechen Monastery in 1925, and received the transmissions and teachings. Dilgo Khyentse requested to spend the rest of his life in solitary meditation. In response, Khyentse Chokyi Lodro told him that &quot;(t)he time has come for you to teach and transmit to others the countless precious teachings you have received.&quot;

Two years later while in retreat, a severe fever occurred at the age of 25, and he then decided to become a tantric practitioner with a consort, which supported his transition as a terton. He married Khandro Lhamo, a traditional Tibetan medicine doctor (&quot;Amchi&quot;) from a modest Kham family while both Khyentse Chokyi Lodro and the 10th Zurmang Trungpa, Karma Chokyi Nyingche, had urged him to pursue terma treasure revelations. A teacher had prophesied that a cure for his illness would be marriage, despite the fact he was uninterested in it. Khandro Lhamo became a well-known expert in Tibetan medicine, a supporter of Shechen Monastery and his life-long companion. They had two daughters, the elder being Dechen Wangmo, and the younger being Chime Wangmo.

===Student and master===
Dilgo Khyentse then spent the next 21 years as an active Terton, while also traveling and teaching. In 1936, he revealed a section of &quot;one of his most celebrated treasures&quot;, &quot;Pema&#x27;s Heart Essence of Longevity (pad+ma tshe yi snying thig)&quot;, which he discovered in the Kingdom of Nangchen. Additional sections were revealed the following year.

At the age of 34, Dilgo Khyentse spent two years with Dzongzar Khyentse Chokyi Lodro, receiving teachings and revealing terma. He was a close student, and specifically received Jamgon Kongtrul&#x27;s Rinchen Terdzod, a collection of Revealed Terma Treasures, and his 
&quot;Treasury of Knowledge (shes bya kun khyab)&quot;. In 1946, Dilgo Khyentse travelled in Kham and strengthened his connections to the lineage of another Terton, Chokgyur Lingpa when he discovered and decoded a sheet of paper which became the treasure cycle of the &quot;Kabgye (bka&#x27; brgyad)&quot;.

He continued his revelations as a Terton while travelling and teaching at Derge, Nangchen, Rebkong, Amye Machen, and other places in Do Kham during the early years of China&#x27;s invasion. His treasure cycle of &quot;Nyak Kilaya (gnyag lugs phur ba)&quot; was revealed in Nangchen.

Later on, the 14th Dalai Lama regarded Dilgo Khyentse as both his principal teacher of the Nyingma school lineage, and his Dzogpa chenpo teacher. Dilgo Khyentse was also one of the main teachers of Chögyam Trungpa, whom is held in high regard. After his passing, many of Chogyam Trungpa&#x27;s students became Dilgo Khyentse&#x27;s students. Dilgo Khyentse was also a considered a master to many qualified teachers from all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

===Escape from Tibet, teachings in exile===
In the mid-1950s, when widespread rebellions broke out in Kham and the Chinese Communists began bombing monasteries and massacring people and livestock, the Chinese forces were also specifically hunting certain tulkus, among them Dilgo Khyentse. Khandro Llhamo refused to divulge his whereabouts for weeks in 1956, before Dilgo Khyentse and his family spontaneously migrated with masses of other Tibetans to Central Tibet and Lhasa, leaving behind his library of dharma books and most of his own writings. Shechen Monastery in Kham was destroyed by the Chinese forces.

Then, during the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the 14th Dalai Lama escaped from Lhasa, and Dilgo Khyentse together with his family and a few students also escaped from Tibet, including his brother, the 9th Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche and Tenga Rinpoche. They headed for the border at Bhutan where they stayed in camps before being permitted to cross into India, where they moved and stayed for several years with Dudjom Rinpoche at Kalimpong. From 1961 to 1962, he taught in Bhutan in response to an invitation, and later he was again invited to Bhutan by Nyimalung Monastery in 1965 after which Bhutan became his primary home.

He made frequent visits to India to give teachings to the 14th Dalai Lama at Dharamasala, and he dedicated himself to preserving the Nyingma school lineage by travelling extensively in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. His first journey to the West was in 1975, and he established a three-year retreat center in the Dordogne, France.

He also engaged in scholarship and composed numerous poems, meditation texts and commentaries. He was a Terton, a discoverer of spiritual treasures, and is credited with discovering numerous termas. He was one of the foremost masters of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, for which he bestowed pith instructions, and is one of the principal holders of the Longchen Nyingtik lineage.

In 1980, he reconstructed Shechen Monastery in Nepal, when he founded the Shechen Tennyi Dargyeling Monastery in Boudhanath, Kathmandu, which was the earliest of the Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in Boudhanath to be built. He rebuilt the Shechen Monastery near the great and spiritually significant Jarung Kashor stupa of Boudhanath, in Kathmandu valley, which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

He travelled to Tibet three times, in 1985, 1988, and 1990, during which he funded and advised rebuilding projects, including the consecration of a statue of Padmasambhava at the Jokhang, the re-consecration of Samye Monastery, the re-consecration of the Derge printing house, and he visited several rebuilt Nyingma school monasteries including Dzogchen, Palyul, Katok, and Shechen Monastery where he was able to stay and bestow public teachings. In between his travels to Tibet, he gave many teachings over the years to hundreds of other monks, nuns, lamas, Khenpos and Khenmos, Rinpoches, disciples, laypeople, and to numerous international students. His senior student is Trulshik Rinpoche, whom he named as a spiritual heir.

During this same period and until his paranirvana on 27 September 1991 in Bhutan, Dilgo Khyentse was also involved in publishing as many Tibetan Buddhist teachings as possible, counting more than 300 volumes altogether.

===Final years===
He was one of the few great Tibetan Rinpoches accorded the honorific title &quot;Kyabje&quot;, or &quot;His Holiness&quot;. Following the death of Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche in 1987, he became the head of the Nyingma School, and remained so until his death in Bhutan on 27 September 1991.

Student Matthieu Ricard remarked:

In November 1992, the ritual cremation ceremony for Dilgo Khyentse was consecrated for three-days near Paro in Bhutan, and was attended by over 100 lamas and ordained monks and nuns, the Royal Family and ministers of Bhutan, 500 western disciples and 50,000 devotees and lay people.

==Preservation of lineages==

Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche has been described as a perfect example of an impartial preserver of Tibetan Buddhist lineages, and a Rime master, since in exile he was instrumental in safeguarding all of the lineages of Tibetan Buddhism without partiality. He received and gave empowerments, and wrote volumes of texts that revitalized and interpreted important transmissions and teachings from all four Tibetan Buddhist schools.

Gyatrul Rinpoche (b. 1924), in a purport to Karma Chagmé Rinpoche (, fl. 17th century), conveys Dilgo Khyentse&#x27;s samaya, diligence and humility in receiving empowerments (Tib: དབང,  Wylie: &quot;dbang&quot;) and oral Dharma transmissions (Tib: ལུང, Wylie: &quot;lung&quot;). B. Alan Wallace elaborates:

==Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche==
The Yangsi of Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche is formally named Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Ugyen Tenzin Jigme Lhundrup (Tib. , Wylie &quot;&quot;), and informally called Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche. He was born in Nepal on the 11th day of the 5th lunar month of the Female Water Bird Year (30 June 1993) in Kathmandu, on the day following Guru Rinpoche&#x27;s birthday. His father is Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche, the son of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, and his mother is Sangyum Dechen Paldron. His siblings are Phakchok Rinpoche, Mingyur Paldron, and Kelsang Bhuti. 

Trulshik Rinpoche is said to have had numerous visions concerning the Yangsi, which he shared with Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse&#x27;s grandson. His recognition was also confirmed by the 14th Dalai Lama. On 29 December 1995 Trulshik Rinpoche performed the Yangsi&#x27;s formal name offering ceremony, in Nepal. Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche was enthroned in December 1996. Trulshik Rinpoche also offered a Long Life prayer which he composed for Dilgo Khyentse II of Shechen, at the sacred Maratika Cave.

Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche personally supervised the upbringing of Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche, in Nepal and also in Bhutan where Khenpo Yeshe Gyaltsen focused on providing Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche&#x27;s &quot;Shedra&quot; education.

In 2010, Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche marked the century anniversary of the birth of Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, and his own 17th year, with celebrations in Nepal and Bhutan and with a major tour of Europe, North America, and Asia. The tour began in France at La Sonnerie in the Dordogne, since La Sonnerie is the main European seat of Dilgo Khyentse, and is the French seat of Dudjom Rinpoche.

Afterwards, Dilgo Khentse Yangsi Rinpoche visited and gave teachings at Lerab Ling in France, before continuing with Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche and Matthieu Ricard to the Americas - U.S., Canada and Mexico. The North American leg of the tour included events in New York state, in Boulder, Colorado, Vermont, and in Canada before the tour traveled to Mexico.

In 2014, Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche and Matthieu Ricard gave talks and teachings in France and in the U.K.. At Nyima Dzong in Paris, an empowerment was given for the Dilgo Khyentse Terma of Vajra Vidharana (Dorje Namjon), and Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche celebrated his birthday. Afterwards, teachings were given at Lerab Ling and at Chanteloube. In the U.K., talks were given at Rigpa London, and a series of talks and empowerments were given at the newly opened Buddhist Community Centre UK in Aldershot, hosted by the Nepali Buddhist Community.

Later in July 2014, Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche returned to Mexico and to his center Shechen Mexico, and held two talks and gave a teaching on Rangjung Pema Nyingtik ngondro practice. In Toronto, Canada, at Riwoche gompa, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche gave empowerments on Namgyalma and Vajrakilaya.

In July 2024, Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche gave an eight-day Kurukulle, Guru Padmasambhava, and Yeshe Tsogyal drubchen and puja, in the historic E Maha Viraha (&quot;Yempi Mahaviraha&quot;) in Patan, Kathmandu, Nepal, where Guru Padmasambhava had taught.

==Film==
The film &quot;Spirit of Tibet: Journey to Enlightenment, The Life and World of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche&quot; was released in 1998. It was made by Matthieu Ricard, a French student, photographer, Buddhist monk, and author who had traveled with Khyentse for 14 years. It tells Dilgo Khyentse&#x27;s story from birth to death, to rebirth. The film also tells of his escape from Tibet, following China&#x27;s brutal invasion of Kham and Central Tibet, and of Dilgo Khyentse&#x27;s determination to preserve and transmit Buddhist teachings far and wide. The film reveals Tibet&#x27;s profound and sacred art, ritual philosophy, and the sacred &quot;cham&quot; dances. Along with rarely photographed areas of Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal, the film features interviews with the 14th Dalai Lama, who also speaks about his own spiritual life.

The film &quot;Brilliant Moon: Glimpses of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche&quot;, written and directed by Neten Chokling Rinpoche, and narrated by Richard Gere and Lou Reed, uses animation, previously unseen archival footage and photos along with new interviews of Tibet&#x27;s qualified masters to tell Dilgo Khyentse&#x27;s life story.

<doc id="1119593" wikidata="Q7988959" url="?curid=1119593" title="Westlake, Los Angeles">
<text>Westlake, also known as the Westlake District, is a residential and commercial neighborhood in Central Los Angeles, California, United States. It was developed in the 1920s. Many of its elegant mansions have been turned into apartments and many new multiple-occupancy buildings have been constructed.

Westlake is a high-density area, with a young and heavily Latino population. It contains many primary and secondary schools.

==History==

===Early development===

In 1887, Westlake was referred to as the &quot;southwest quarter&quot; of Los Angeles. The Westlake hills were already &quot;dotted with fine residences, and it is plainly to be seen that the development of this quarter is in its infancy. The Bonnie Brae, Westlake Park and other tracts in the neighborhood have been almost wholly disposed of by the subdividers, and many of the lots have passed into second and third hands, at advancing prices. The Baptist College, now well under way, looms up to the northward.&quot;

The neighborhood was named for Westlake Park, the land for which had been donated by Henricus Wallace Westlake, a Canadian physician who moved to Los Angeles around 1888. He built his house on Burlington Avenue in the district that later bore his name; the residence was the first to rise in the rolling hills west of the more settled and built-up part of the town.

One of the first areas of Los Angeles west of Figueroa Street to see residential development, Westlake came to have a significant Jewish population. Wealthy businessmen commuted to downtown, Wilshire Center (now Koreatown), Hollywood, and the Miracle Mile from the district&#x27;s Spanish Revival and Art Deco mansions. Around the 1940s the district&#x27;s northwestern blocks fringed the home of Los Angeles&#x27; early working class Filipino population who were shifted from what is today Little Tokyo and Bunker Hill, some of which remain in parts of Westlake and nearby neighborhoods like Echo Park, Silver Lake, and East Hollywood.

===Oil exploitation===

In 1899, newly drilled oil wells in the area, with their unsightly derricks, were said to cause pollution and runoff in the streets &quot;at every hard rain,&quot; and residents of the neighborhood were &quot;indignant that nothing was done for their relief.&quot; The city had declared a 1,600-foot zone around Westlake Park where drilling was forbidden (later modified to 1,000 feet), but the legality of that ordinance was under attack by oilmen such as W.E. de Groot. Even City Attorney Walter F. Haas thought the law was invalid, although he had to defend it as part of his duty. Nevertheless, a Superior Court judge, in the case of &quot;People v. Richard Green and others,&quot; held the city law to be valid. By 1900, however, it was found that oil production in Westlake had been, in effect, &quot;pumped dry,&quot; and the situation ceased to make news.

===Proposed factory district===

Residents were alarmed in May 1919 by a petition being circulated by entrepreneur Arthur Evans to build a &quot;high-class,&quot; six-story building on the southwest corner of Westlake Avenue and Orange Street &quot;for the manufacture of women&#x27;s apparel.&quot;

Supposedly having the backing of 85% of property owners adjoining the site in the affected Lazard tract, the promoters said they wanted to build in the Lakewood District because they could not get the kind of women workers they sought if they built in the city&#x27;s industrial district, with its associated smoke and dust. They promised the employment of 1,000 workers, mostly women, as well as a school to teach &quot;the finer grades of needlework&quot; and a permanent exhibition space devoted to showing how garments are made. A &quot;mammoth petition of protest&quot; was presented to a City Council committee on June 12 by a throng of opponents and the applicant, identified as the Brownstein-Lewis Company, withdrew the plan and never resubmitted it.

=== Decline and Redevelopment ===
In its early years, Westlake was considered one of the most desirable residential areas in the city – &quot;the new gathering place for the city&#x27;s carriage trade,&quot; as one observer recalled in 1997. With time, though, as another put it, &quot;The white gentry fled to Encino and Westwood, leaving their ghost buildings behind them.&quot;

In the 1980s the neighborhood was infused with refugees from Central American countries like El Salvador, where a civil war had displaced a million people. In time, young Salvadorans formed a gang called Mara Salvatrucha, meaning, roughly, Gang of the Salvadoran Guy; for short, it was labeled MS-13. In time, the gang had spread to 33 other states and five countries.

By 1990 Westlake had become a grim area &quot;where heroin addicts and youthful gang members control the public alleyways and clamber across people&#x27;s rooftops to elude police.&quot; Some alleys had become refuges for the homeless, with no toilets, and piles of garbage were accumulating. The neighborhood was replete with sidewalk vendors in 1993, from whom sometimes gang members, called &quot;cholos,&quot; were demanding &quot;rent&quot; to use the public sidewalks, which were bustling with refugees from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and other Latin American countries. It was said that trepidation, or fear, was &quot;the price of living and working in the Westlake district.&quot; People lived on the underground economy, strictly cash, and the district was infested with &quot;some of the city&#x27;s largest and most menacing street gangs,&quot; with police and residents complaining of drug dealing, prostitution, thievery and extortion. Yet there was an air of economic energy and potential, with the vast majority of the residents just wanting to make an honest living.

Seventeen years later, crime had dropped and Westlake was on a road to gentrification. As rentals and property values in Downtown Los Angeles and nearby Koreatown rose, artists and other creative people moved into Westlake. &quot;Swanky nightclubs, organic tamale co-ops and art galleries&quot; followed. The change was traced to intensive anti-crime and cleanup efforts in MacArthur Park, particularly since the installation of surveillance cameras in 2004. A business improvement district was formed.

In January 2012, the city launched a campaign under a new city ordinance dealing with illegal street vendors throughout Los Angeles, but with principal effect in Westlake and the Venice neighborhood. The ordinance outlawed the sale of items with &quot;utilitarian value,&quot; like socks and T-shirts but allowed vendors to sell art objects. A city-sponsored weekend market was set up, which required vendors to undergo training and licensing. Enforcement of this ordinance has been very sporadic, and sidewalk vending remains very common throughout the areas surrounding MacArthur Park, especially along Alvarado Street.

In the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, MacArthur Park and the surrounding blocks have become a major epicenter of the opioid epidemic in the United States. The area, which has long struggled with public drug dealing and drug use, has seen some of the highest rates of Fentanyl overdoses in the city. The massive increase in the homeless population, along with the introduction of extremely potent synthetic opioids, has led to a public health crisis in the neighborhood. In many areas surrounding the park, especially in the alleys behind Alvarado Street, public drug use has become a constant reality, and individual locations frequently see multiple overdoses every single day.

==Notable construction==

===Residential===
* Hotel, 1901. A five-story hotel was planned for the southeastern corner of Sixth and Alvarado, across from Westlake Park, with John Parkinson as the architect. There were to be 300 guest rooms, as well as &quot;public and private dining-rooms, kitchen, ladies&#x27; billiard room, office, ball-room and the many business accessories of a first-class tourist hotel.&quot;
* Hotel, 1902. Ground was broken at Sixth and San Joaquin (today&#x27;s Lake Street) for a four-story hotel with Mission architecture designed by A.L. Haley and George Black on the northwest corner, opposite the park. &quot;The house will be so arranged that all guests&#x27; rooms will be outside, and it will have hydraulic elevators, a ballroom with stage, and the usual billiard-rooms, bathrooms, dining-rooms, kitchens and servants&#x27; quarters. For the latter there will also be provided a separate, detached building that will contain forty-eight rooms.&quot;
* Apartment building, 1915. A seven-story structure at Sixth and Lake was designed by John Parkinson for owner James H. Edmonds and featured a ladies&#x27; parlor, a billiard and card room and a 40-by-70-foot ballroom. There were 32 four-room and eight three-room suites. &quot;All bedrooms will be arranged for open beds instead of the customary wall beds... . A refrigeration system designed to cool all the ice boxes in the various apartments from a central plant in the basement will be a feature.&quot; It later became the Hotel Ansonia.
* Hotel Californian, 1925. The spacious hotel on the northwest corner of Sixth and Bonnie Brae, with its &quot;baths and showers, double closets and radio communications,&quot; was opened with elaborate entertainment and ceremonies on April 1. &quot;A novel arrangements of doors can operate to divide the building into quarters, as an extra precaution against fires... . The main lobby itself is done in antique wood effect, polychromed and picked in with dulled-off primary colors, and carefully highlighted with gold leaf. The fixture are hand-wrought ornamental iron, while beautiful tapestries and pictures on the walls add the finishing touches.&quot;[6] The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1961 &quot;(see Notable fires, below).&quot;
* Hotel Arcady and Wilshire Royale, 1927. The 12-story hotel was launched in January 1927 on the northeast corner of Wilshire and Rampart boulevards at a cost of $2.25 million, of which bonds of $1.325 million were purchased by S.W. Strauss and Company. Designed by architects Walter &amp; Elsen, the building, constructed for Olive Phillips, housed two- to four-room suites. The completed hotel was to be operated by Fletcher &amp; Lilly, who were already running the nearby Gaylord Apartments. In 1953 the hotel was bought by Fifield Manor, a nonprofit corporation, to become a senior residence. Mrs. Helen Ramsay Fifield was listed as the president. The name of the 193-unit Beaux-Arts building was changed to Wilshire Royale, and it was purchased by MWest Holdings for $32.5 million in 2015.
* Apartment project, 2010. The MacArthur Park Metro Apartments, a $45 million joint venture between Metro and the Los Angeles Housing Partnership, among others. broke ground. It was to include affordable-housing units and some 30,000 square feet of retail space.

===Other===

* Masonic Lodge, 1914. Oliver Perry Dennis and Henry Harwood Hewitt were the architects for a $30,000 building erected on the southwest corner of Eighth and Burlington by the Westlake Masonic Association, with the ground floor given over to space for seven or eight retail shops and the second floor for the lodge headquarters, lodge hall finished in Philippine mahogany and banquet hall finished in white enamel.
* Elks Lodge, 1924. Plans for a magnificent, $1.5 million. seven-story Elks Lodge on the southwest corner of Sixth and Park View streets, with an entrance on Carondelet Street, were announced in March 1924. It was to consist of a lodge room with seating capacity for 1,500 people, a ballroom with a stage area for presentations and a gymnasium. On the fourth floor were to be a grill, billiard and card rooms, seven private dining rooms, directors&#x27; rooms and a band and glee club hall. There were to be 175 hotel rooms, and in the basement were planned six bowling alleys and a swimming pool. There was a 350-car garage with ten handball courts on the roof. Two roof gardens were planned. Architects were Curlett &amp; Beelman. The structure was sold by the Elks and is now the Park Plaza Hotel (Los Angeles) at 607 South Park View.

====Housing====

The neighborhood is home to many large apartment complexes built during its heyday in the early 20th century. The old housing stock and very large population of low-income, immigrant renters has attracted many absentee landlords with reputations for neglecting building maintenance and subjecting tenants to hazardous conditions.

In 1990 a jury convicted a landlord of 23 counts of having slum conditions at a building he owned at 737 South Westlake Avenue in Los Angeles. Devanand Sharma failed to provide tenants with heat, did not repair broken windows, fire doors and smoke detectors, and kept walls, ceilings and plumbing in a deteriorated condition. His brother was dubbed the city&#x27;s &quot;worst slumlord&quot; after a 1987 conviction for slum conditions and had been a fugitive for two years.

In 1993, in the wake of a deadly fire at 330 South Burlington Avenue &quot;(see Notable fires, below),&quot; major reforms proposed to help avert similar tragedies had not been implemented, and serious fire safety violations persisted in the Westlake and Pico-Union areas. Plans for new fees, a fire inspection task force and a computerized record-keeping system were stalled. But fire officials said that budget constraints and the city bureaucracy thwarted their plans. Nevertheless, in that year an appeals court said that a trial could go ahead against Highland Federal Bank, even though it was not an actual owner; it was accused of operating a network of slum buildings in Los Angeles, for one of which, the Cameo Hotel at 504 South Bonnie Brae Street in Westlake, the owner was listed as &quot;Teluce Black,&quot; a Labrador retriever. That decision set a statewide precedent. Authorities alleged the bank knowingly helped finance purchases in Westlake, Echo Park, Hollywood, South-Central, Koreatown and Pico-Union by buyers who had no means and no intention of keeping the structures in repair. Slum conditions were cleaned up after the suit was filed, and, in a 1996 settlement, the bank agreed to pay US$1.4 million to tenants, to the city and to public-interest attorneys.

In 1999 Judge Leland Harris sentenced another landlord, Ronald J. Olenczuk, to live in a room on the fifth floor of his own six-story, 96-unit building at 744 South Beacon Avenue The owner had to remain there from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. for 45 consecutive days. During the other hours he was allowed to supervise repairs to the building. The landlord had been found guilty of 12 code violations on the building, including broken fire doors, fire escape drop-ladders that did not work, blocked fire-sprinkler controls, broken windows, broken and missing smoke detectors and exposed live electrical wiring. He had to pay US$1,774 in fines and perform 100 hours of community service. Other legal action followed against other slum building owners.

==Geography==

Multiple sources outline different boundaries for Westlake.

===City of Los Angeles===

The Westlake Community Plan area (CPA) of the city of Los Angeles is bounded by Temple Street on the north, the Harbor Freeway on the east, the Santa Monica Freeway on the south, Washington Boulevard on the southwest, and an irregular line along Hoover Street on the west.

Los Angeles City Planning notes that the Westlake CPA &quot;includes the neighborhoods of Historic Filipinotown, Pico-Union, Rampart Village, and Westlake, among others.&quot;

Neighborhood councils that fall within the Westlake CPA are as follows: Westlake North, Westlake South, MacArthur Park (partly), Rampart Village (partly), Pico–Union (partly), Echo Park (partly), and Downtown Los Angeles (partly).

===Mapping L.A. Project===

In the Los Angeles Times&#x27; Mapping L.A. project, the street boundaries of Westlake are the Hollywood Freeway on the north, Glendale Boulevard and Second Street on the east, Beaudry Avenue and the Harbor Freeway on the southeast, West Olympic Boulevard on the southeast and south, Westmoreland Avenue, Wilshire Place and Virgil Avenue on the west, and Temple Street and Hoover Street on the northwest. The &quot;Times&quot; notes that its entry on Westlake includes the neighborhoods of Historic Filipinotown, Lafayette Park, MacArthur Park and Temple–Beaudry.

In Mapping L.A., Westlake is flanked by Silver Lake to the north, Echo Park to the northeast and east, Downtown to the southeast, Pico-Union to the south and southwest and Koreatown to the west. Westlake touches East Hollywood on the northwest.

===Google Maps===
Google Maps draws the following boundaries for Westlake: The Hollywood Freeway on the north, the Harbor Freeway and Lucas Street on the east, the Santa Monica Freeway on the south. The boundary on the west is Hoover Street to Wilshire Boulevard, and Virgil Avenue to the Hollywood Freeway.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 108,839 residents in the 2.72-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 38,214 people per square mile, the second-highest density of any community in Los Angeles County, after Koreatown. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 117,756. It was estimated in 1993 that 85,000 people lived within a mile of the Alvarado/MacArthur Park Red Line station and that the density of this neighborhood rivaled that of Manhattan in New York City. Another report the same year said that at 147 people per acre Westlake had four times the average density of Manhattan and that &quot;The vast majority of units are occupied by more than one family. Firefighters often find babies sleeping in dresser drawers, and children in closets that serve as their bedrooms.&quot; Nevertheless, census takers found that the average household size of three people was about the same as the rest of the city. Renters occupied 94.9% of the housing units, and house or apartment owners just 5.1%

Heavily Latino, Westlake was considered &quot;not especially diverse&quot; ethnically. The breakdown was Latinos, 73.4%; Asians, 16.5%; whites, 4.5%; blacks, 3.9%, and others, 1.7%. Mexico (36.8%) and El Salvador (17.2%) were the most common places of birth for the 67.6% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high compared to the city as a whole. The median age for residents was 27, considered young for both the city and the county.

The median household income in 2008 dollars was $26,757, a low figure for Los Angeles, and a high percentage of households earned $20,000 or less.

The percentages of never-married men and women, 47% and 36.4%, respectively, were among the county&#x27;s highest. The 2000 census found 5,325 families headed by single parents, a high rate for both the city and the county. There were 2,591 military veterans in 2000, or 3.5%, a low figure for Los Angeles.

==Transportation==
Public transportation in Westlake was first proposed in 1887 by railroad entrepreneurs Herman Silver and J.F. Crank as a double-track street cable railroad with the western terminus at Seventh and Alvarado streets and the eastern at &quot;the proposed union depot of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Company near the western extremity of the First Street Bridge,&quot; later amended to continue the road along First Street to Aliso Avenue and Chicago Street. In return for the franchise, the two men offered to donate $10,000 to the city. The railway ran to the southeastern corner of Westlake Park.

Westlake/MacArthur Park station of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system serves the neighborhood. Its entrance is across Alvarado Street from MacArthur Park. The station is served by both the B and D lines, and is the location of a city-sanctioned sidewalk market where vendors are permitted to set up on designated days.

==Emergency services==

===Police===

====Division headquarters====

Westlake is patrolled by the Rampart Division of the Los Angeles Police Department, 1401 West 6th Street at Valencia Street, within the Westlake neighborhood.

====Notable crimes====
1906. On August 16, 1906, Annie Sanderson, 45, was slashed to death by her husband, Edward H. Sanderson, president of the California Truck Company, in their residence at 1336 Westlake Avenue. He then committed suicide by cutting his throat with the same knife.
1908. Wielding a sharpened ax, Henry J. Dufty, 56, slew his sleeping 24-year-old son, Fred Dufty, a machinist, in the son&#x27;s bungalow at 247 North Mountain View Avenue on August 13, then walked uphill to nearby 453 North Westlake Avenue, where he used the same instrument to decapitate his pregnant daughter, Zaidah La Com. He returned to his home, where he cut his own throat, attempting suicide. He had previously purchased gravestones for himself and his two children, which had already been laid at Evergreen Cemetery. A jury trial resulted in a verdict of insanity.

1922. On February 2, the body of motion picture director William Desmond Taylor was found on the floor of the living room of his bungalow at 404 Alvarado Street. He had been shot. The killer was never found.

1948. Joyce Corbley or Corbly, age given as either 22 or 38, died after shooting herself in the head on June 26 when she played a game of Russian roulette in a room at the Ansonia Apartments, 2205 West Sixth Street.

1996. On March 29, Linda Morimoto, a noted physician of the Japanese American community, was found bludgeoned to death on the floor of her ransacked home in the 400 block of Lafayette Park Place. No arrests were made.

2010. Two nights of violent protests troubled the Westlake neighborhood after a policeman fatally shot Manuel Jaminez, a Guatemalan construction worker who spoke no English and very little Spanish, at Sixth Street and Union Avenue on September 5. Police said Jaminez had threatened a woman with a knife, which he refused to drop.

2010. The mummified remains of a still-born baby and an infant, brother and sister, were discovered in August, wrapped in newspapers from the 1930s and hidden inside a trunk in the basement of an apartment building near MacArthur Park. They were identified as the children of Janet Mann Barrie, who had lived in the building and who died in Canada at age 97 in 1994.

2012. Pedro Martinez, a 26-year-old gang member, was sentenced to 100 years to life in prison for killing Andres Ordonez, 25, a church deacon who was trying to stop a woman from spray-painting, or tagging, an outside wall at Iglesia Principe de Paz Church on Beverly Boulevard. Ordonez was slain on November 4, 2012, when he and a fellow parishioner exited the church to stop the woman&#x27;s vandalism; Martinez stepped from a nearby vehicle and opened fire, killing one and wounding the other. Nearby residents said that gang members had threatened violence against those who complained about or painted over graffiti. The woman was arrested and faces trial.

===Fire service===

====Engine company====

Los Angeles Fire Department Station 11 serves the area. In 1993 it was said to be one of the busiest fire stations in the country.

====Notable fires====

Hotel Coronado, 1905. An early-morning fire destroyed the massive and popular Hotel Coronado at 667 Coronado Street on December 4, 1905, after a delay in communicating by telephone with the fire department. The blaze spread rapidly, and more than eighty guests had to flee, some in their nightclothes. Sarah and Helen Mathewson were lessees of the hotel, which was owned by M.N. Russ Avery and Superior Judge Walter Bordwell. The tourist hotel was one of the most expensive in the city, &quot;being patronized by wealthy persons to whom the cost was not a consideration.&quot;

By the time firefighters led by Chief Walter Lips arrived about an hour after the blaze was discovered, the hotel was already in ruins, and the men turned their efforts to saving nearby buildings. Close by were &quot;scores of mansions, some of them among the finest in the city. Sparks dropping on the dry roofs... caused small blazes in many places. The occupants of the buildings in danger succeeded in extinguishing the blazing embers... . The costly furnishings of a number of fine houses were removed to places of safety outside the zone of danger,&quot; and neighbors gave shelter to hotel guests who had fled. The Mathewson sisters were overcome by smoke, but they survived; their pet dog died. Helen Mathewson later asserted charges of negligence against Chief Lips, which he denied.

Hotel Californian, 1961–1994. Flames engulfed the upper two floors of the five-story Hotel Californian at 1907 West Sixth Street on August 2, 1961. Firemen were threatened with injury when a water hydrant burst and a hose flailed about viciously before water was turned off. Scores of television aerials on the roof of the hotel hampered the men before the flames were brought under control. The hotel reopened, but became &quot;a classic slum building where a changing cast of owners suck out profits, fail to make repairs and leave tenants in miserable conditions.&quot; City officials closed its entrances with plywood and metal bars, but homeless people broke through and made it their home. On November 21, 1994, it took 186 firefighters from three companies to quell a massive blaze that all but destroyed the place. Finally, the City Council ordered the old hotel razed as an irreparable hazard.

Burlington Avenue, 1993. Nine people, mostly immigrants from Latin America, and two fetuses died as a result of a fire that ravaged an apartment building at 330 Burlington Avenue on May 5. More than forty were injured. Some residents escaped by jumping from or, in the case of children, being thrown from upper floors into the arms of rescuers, but others died when they were trapped on stairways. Members of the 18th Street Gang joined in the rescue effort. More than a hundred shocked survivors were given emergency shelter in the Belmont High School gymnasium. It was the fourth-deadliest fire in the city&#x27;s history. Fire officials said the owners failed to correct a faulty alarm system, amid other fire code violations. Some fire doors had been illegally propped open.
Four hundred mourners were at a special eulogy at the Church of the Immaculate Conception on Ninth Street (later James M. Wood Boulevard) in Westlake, where Cardinal Roger M. Mahony called upon city authorities to work toward improving apartment safety. Among the mourners were elementary school classmates of two of the dead children and a Fire Department honor guard of about two dozen firefighters, dressed in formal black uniforms. In all, the caskets at the funeral Mass contained the remains of 11, including three mothers (two of them pregnant), two fetuses and six children. The two fetuses were placed with their mothers in the caskets. A 15-month-old child of Guatemalan parents was buried earlier in Calvary Cemetery. The other remains were returned to Mexico and Guatemala.

In 1998, prosecutors filed charges against two men in the crime, alleging they were members of the 18th Street Gang who were attempting to intimidate an apartment manager who had tried to drive away drug dealers from the place. The charges were dropped after two years for lack of evidence.

In February 2017, police arrested &quot;multiple people&quot; in connection with the arson. Joseph Monge, 44, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in February 2020 and was to be sentenced to 11 years in prison. Others under arrest and facing trial were Johanna Lopez and Ramiro &quot;Greedy&quot; Valerio.

Footage of the aftermath of the fire appears in the 1993 mondo film &quot;Death Scenes 3&quot;.

McKinley House, 1994. After years of neglect and controversy, this boarded-up historic monument at Third Street and LaFayette Park Place finally succumbed when flames took the remains of what had been an elegant Italian Renaissance-style home overlooking Rampart Boulevard. Two transients were found dead when firemen were able to inspect the ruins. The 20-room house was built in 1915 by an Ohio millionaire who lived in it during the winter. Other families had it, too, until mortuary owner Maytor McKinley bought it in 1945. He died in 1970, and his widow, Vari Komp McKinley, lived there until her death in the mid-1980s. In 1987 developers purchased it with the intent of raising a 118-unit apartment complex on it. At the prodding of the Los Angeles Conservancy, the city declared it to be a cultural-historic monument. Rod and Sherry Daniels, intrigued by the idea of owning the beautiful old structure, bought it for $1 with the intention of moving it to Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley. Over six years those plans stagnated and the property kept deteriorating until the 1994 blaze put an end to the Daniels&#x27; dream and the house as a historic structure.

Neighborhood residents launched a drive to turn the rubble-strewn lot into a neighborhood park; today the site is home to a privately owned school called the Lafayette Park Primary Center.

<text>An Unsuitable Job for a Woman is the title of a detective novel by English writer P. D. James and of a TV series of four dramas developed from that novel. It was published by Faber and Faber in the UK in 1972 and by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons in the US.

The book features private detective Cordelia Gray, the protagonist of both this title and &quot;The Skull Beneath the Skin&quot; (1982). It is noted for introducing a new type of female detective at the start of the feminist era.

==Plot summary==

22-year-old private detective Cordelia Gray walks into the London office she shares with former police detective Bernie Pryde to find her partner has committed suicide. Pryde has left everything, including his unlicensed handgun, to Cordelia, who decides to keep the failing agency open out of gratitude. When she returns to her office from the funeral service, she is visited by her first client, Elizabeth Leaming, assistant to prominent scientist Sir Ronald Callender, whose son Mark recently hanged himself.

Cordelia travels to Cambridge, where Mark had left university and taken a job as gardener, despite decent grades and the prospect of a considerable inheritance from his maternal grandfather. Her task is to discover the reason for Mark&#x27;s death but she begins to suspect foul play. She meets Mark&#x27;s student friends, who are reluctant to talk and attempt to convince Cordelia that his death really was suicidal.

Cordelia decides to move into the rundown cottage on the estate where Mark had worked. As she sifts through Mark&#x27;s effects, trying to get a clearer picture of his life, she becomes ever more convinced that his death could not have been suicide. Repeatedly, friendly overtures from Mark&#x27;s former companions try to lead her away from the investigation but Cordelia is determined to succeed in her first solo case. Returning to the cottage one night and finding an effigy hanging from the same hook on which Mark&#x27;s body had been suspended convinces her that someone is trying to scare her off.

She finds out that a certain Nanny Pilbeam, formerly nanny to Mark&#x27;s mother, had attended Mark&#x27;s cremation and goes to question her. The old woman tells Cordelia that she went to see Mark at his college and gave him a Book of Common Prayer that his mother had wanted him to have when he turned 21. Cordelia finds the book in the cottage and discovers in it evidence that Lady Callender could not have been Mark&#x27;s mother.

Back at the cottage the following night, someone attacks Cordelia, throws her down a well and replaces the cover. She is saved by a combination of her own resourcefulness and the good luck that the cottage owner notices the well has been tampered with. Cordelia in turn lies in wait with Bernie&#x27;s gun in order to ambush her would-be killer. He turns out to be Sir Ronald&#x27;s laboratory assistant, Lunn, who had been tailing her during her investigations. However, he escapes in his van, only to die in a collision with a truck. Certain now of her case, Cordelia continues to Sir Ronald&#x27;s house, where Miss Leaming takes her gun from her and leads her to Sir Ronald. Cordelia privately accuses him of the murder of his son, which he defiantly admits, sure that nothing can be proved against him. Miss Leaming, however, who has overheard him, enters the office and shoots him with Cordelia&#x27;s gun.

Miss Leaming confesses to Cordelia that she was Mark&#x27;s true mother but was prevented from telling him by Sir Ronald. Lady Callender had been infertile and died shortly after Mark&#x27;s birth. Sir Ronald had murdered Mark when he was close to discovering the truth, so as not to lose his wife&#x27;s fortune. Cordelia sympathises with Miss Leaming and is determined to protect Mark&#x27;s legacy, so the two rearrange the crime scene to look like yet another suicide and it is accepted as such by the coroner. The case, however, is referred to Chief Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh, who had been Bernie Pryde&#x27;s commander originally and then sacked him. Word arrives during their interview that Leaming has been killed in a car crash, allowing Cordelia to maintain the fiction they concocted together. Dalgliesh admits to Cordelia, based on his observation of her abilities, that perhaps he had underrated Pryde. He also believes that he has worked out the true facts of the case, but in private conference with his superiors says there is little point in disturbing the official story in view of the social and international pressures on the police.

Cordelia returns resignedly to the agency and finds her next client waiting, a man who believes his &#x27;lady friend&#x27; might be cheating on him.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; judged the book &quot;A top-rated puzzle of peril that holds you all the way&quot;, whose characters &quot;are anything but stereotypes,&quot; although &quot;at the very end, things are a little too pat&quot;. Jacques Barzun, in a later supplement to his &quot;A Catalogue of Crime&quot;, however, thought it &quot;barely passable&quot;. The novel also received a nomination for an American Edgar Award, and many requests for another novel featuring Cordelia Gray.

Authors commenting on the introduction of the new type of female detective noted the novel as a key pioneering work in which the focus is &quot;at least as much on character and theme as…on crime&quot;. Another critic described it as &quot;a political contribution to the recasting of the female detective mould&quot;, noting in particular how its heroine avenges a young man&#x27;s murder by his father and connives in the murder in return of the father by the boy&#x27;s mother in an act of feminine solidarity.

Critics also note that despite the novel&#x27;s feminist undertones, Cordelia remains under male authority during the novel. Throughout her investigation, Cordelia follows the teachings of Bernie Pryde&#x27;s mentor, Superintendent Dalgliesh. SueEllen Campbell says that &quot;Throughout the novel, then, Dalgliesh is present as a sort of transcendental authority.&quot; Similarly, Kate Watson writes in the European Journal of English Studies that &quot;While Cordelia is the central investigating figure in the text, always in the margins is the shadowy figure of Inspector Adam Dalgleish… the patriarchal figure that embodies the conventions of the traditional family of crime fiction.&quot;

=== The Role of &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot; in Detective Fiction ===
&quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot; instated Cordelia Gray as the first female private investigator in detective fiction. This is frequently acknowledged in the novel, as other characters repeatedly question whether Cordelia&#x27;s occupation is &quot;suitable&quot; for her. This question inspires the book&#x27;s title, acknowledging Cordelia&#x27;s novelty within the genre.

According to Dennis Porter, the novel also stands out from other detective fiction because of its commentary on ethics. In contrast to the detectives that predate the novel, Cordelia continually questions the morals of the people she encounters, and is also motivated by achieving justice for Mark. Based on her successful detection as an independent, &quot;morally upright&quot; woman, Cordelia was frequently viewed as a &quot;hero&quot; around the time of the novel&#x27;s release.

Cordelia also has a distinct closeness to the victim. During her investigation, she lives in Mark&#x27;s cottage and wears some of his clothes, even using his belt to pull herself out of the well and save her own life. In addition, Cordelia relates to Mark on account of their shared experiences. Both Cordelia and Mark&#x27;s mothers died shortly after they were born. Mark attended Cambridge University, which Cordelia sought to attend herself. Finally, they both have fathers more dedicated to working for the greater-good than caring for their children. Joan G. Kotker claims that this explains Cordelia&#x27;s motivation to attain justice for Mark, as she is also &quot;avenging herself.&quot;

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
The book has been twice adapted. The first adaptation, directed by Chris Petit, was released in UK cinemas in 1982, featuring Pippa Guard as Cordelia. It was financed and produced by Goldcrest Films/ The National Film Finance Corporation and Don Boyd.

A television series starring Helen Baxendale as Cordelia and Annette Crosbie as Edith Sparshott was made in 1997 and 2001, based in part upon the book.

<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the postal areas Netherlands Antilles as well as its predecessor Curaçao. The area consisted of the islands Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius (now part of the Netherlands as postal area &quot;Caribbean Netherlands&quot;) as well as Sint Maarten, Curaçao and Aruba (which each are separate postal areas).

Early mail service in the islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean consisted of carriage by casual ship, and a number of letters are recorded from this period. A British post office operated during the occupation of 1807 to 1815. In 1825, the Dutch government established a post office at Willemstad; from then until 1834 a packet operated between there and Hellevoetsluis. From 1842 to 1854, mail was carried by British packets, and after 1854 by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, until 1885.

== Curaçao (1873–1950) ==
The first postage stamps of Curaçao (the name was used for the six islands collectively when the area was named Curaçao and Dependencies and Territory of Curaçao) were issued 23 May 1873; they depicted William III in profile, and were inscribed &quot;CURAÇAO&quot;, as were all issues for the next 77 years. The six original values (2c to 50c) were joined by a 2.50-gulden value in 1879, a 12c in 1886, and four more values in 1889. All of these were issued without gum (due to the heat and humidity) until 1890.

In 1889 a longstanding tradition began with the issuance of low-value (1c to 5c) stamps showing only a large numeral. In 1891 the 30c value was surcharged 25c. Meanwhile, the passing of William left his daughter Wilhelmina to be among the youngest persons depicted on a stamp to that date, with five values appearing between 1892 and 1896. Only the vignette actually changed.

Additional surcharges were needed periodically; 2c in 1895, and in 1901/1902 they were applied to stamps of the Netherlands. A new definitive series came out in 1904, with numeral in a horizontal layout for low values, and Wilhelmina in a circular frame for the higher values. Additional values were added in 1906 and 1908.

In 1915 a new series reused designs from the Netherlands Indies stamps of a few years previously. The low-value numbers were changed to have a white instead of a hatched background, for readability, while medium values showed the Queen and a ship at sea, with the highest values showing the Queen flanked by palm trees. These stamps continued as the standard for many years, with some values getting color changes; for instance, the 5c was originally rose, then changed to green in 1922, then to lilac in 1926.

The first commemorative stamps, in 1923, celebrated Wilhelmina&#x27;s 25th anniversary, depicting her with a finely-engraved portrait. The portrait was reused in the definitive series of 1928, which added a steamship to the bottom of the design.

In 1934, a series of 17 types marked the 300th anniversary of the colony; designs included portraits of figures significant in history, plus a view of Van Walbeecks&#x27; ship.

1936 saw a new definitive series, with the usual lower values as numerals, now vertical in an oval frame, while from 10c on up was a profile of Wilhelmina wearing a sort of shawl or veil drawn back; a depiction of the Queen not seen any other stamps of the Dutch area.

The 40th anniversary issue in 1938 and the definitives of 1941/1942/1947 reverted to the use of the same profiles of Wilhelmina as the Netherlands and the Netherlands Indies.

A set of 15 airmail stamps in October 1942 were bi-colored designs showing airplanes, maps, and scenery in various combinations; they were soon followed by set of six regular issues in 1943 that were also bi-colored, each with a scenic view of a different island. A last set of airmail stamps appeared in 1947, the lower values a stylized plane and posthorn design, and the higher showing a DC-4 skimming the waves.

A 1948 set of 11, showing white-haired Wilhelmina in profile, quickly became dated as Queen Juliana was invested with the crown in September; she appeared on a pair of stamps commemorating the occasion in September.

== Netherlands Antilles (1950–2010) ==

The name of the colony officially changed in 1949, and was first inscribed in two stamps issued in October for the 74th anniversary of the UPU. The name change also entailed new definitives, which began appearing in 1950, using the same design as issued for the Netherlands the previous year, but inscribed &quot;NED. ANTILLEN&quot;.

A handful of commemoratives appeared during the 1950s, and then 1958 new definitives adopted a simple and artistic designs representing the different islands. The designs continued in use for many years, with new sets of (higher) values supplementing the originals in 1973 and 1977.

The numbers of stamps issued each year gradually crept upward, but still at a relatively restrained pace. The focus of issues was generally on local wildlife and tourism themes.

After Aruba obtained the status of country in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, it formed its own postal area.

=== After the dissolution===
After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, three issuing identities formed: Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the Caribbean Netherlands.

<doc id="1119614" wikidata="Q2852832" url="?curid=1119614" title="Anthony Callea">
<text>Anthony Cosmo Callea (born 13 December 1982) is an Australian singer-songwriter and stage actor who rose to prominence as the runner-up in the 2004 season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. Callea&#x27;s debut single, a cover of Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s song &quot;The Prayer&quot;, is the fastest-selling single by an Australian artist; it held the number-one spot on the ARIA Singles Chart for five weeks, a record for the debut single of an &quot;Australian Idol&quot; contestant, and was the second-highest-selling Australian single of the 2000s.

Callea has accumulated a string of awards, including an ARIA Music Award, Channel V Artist of the Year, Pop Republic Artist of the Year, MTV Viewers&#x27; Choice Award, Variety&#x27;s Young Entertainer of the Year, an MO Award, and a Gospel Music Award. He is known for his powerful trained voice and his versatility in a range of genres in releases and live performances. All but one of the tracks on his second album &quot;A New Chapter&quot; were co-written by him. October 2011 saw Callea release his first new music in four years, a single titled &quot;Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh&quot;, self-funded, released and distributed as a fully independent venture through his own production company, Vox Enterprises. The dance-pop track was co-written in LA with two-time Grammy-nominated and official DJ for the Black Eyed Peas, Poet Name Life.

In March 2013, it was announced Callea signed a record deal with ABC Music and would release his third studio album on 26 April 2013. The new release, entitled &quot;Thirty&quot;, was the first of two albums released that year, and were distributed by Universal Music.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://auspop.blogspot.com.au/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The second, released on 8 November 2013, was a Christmas album titled &quot;This Is Christmas&quot;. In August 2014 Callea released his third album with ABC music but, in contrast to previous albums, this was a Live DVD/CD &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentlemen: The Songs of George Michael&quot; filmed and recorded at the Palms at Crown Melbourne. The DVD debuted at number 1 on the Australian ARIA Charts. On 5 August 2016, after three albums with ABC Music, Callea announced that he had re-signed with Sony Music Australia and released his sixth album &quot;Backbone&quot; in September 2016.

==Early life and music career==
Anthony Callea is the eldest child and first grandchild on both sides of the family. He has 16 cousins. His family were builders, dentists and lawyers.

Anthony Callea started singing and performing at age five after telling his mother that he wanted to be a singer. His mother sent him to a performing arts school and began vocal training with Liana Scali, with whom her remained until the age of 18.

In a 2014 interview with &quot;Sydney Unleashed&quot;, Callea stated, &quot;I started recording and writing when I was 16. When I turned 18, I started gigging more and eventually was working 2-3 nights a week. I also became a vocal coach and ended up having 32 private students a week. I was 21 when I auditioned for &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and that was definitely the turning point for me.&quot;

===2004: &quot;Australian Idol&quot;===
He was selected for the final 30 in the television series &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in 2004. Based on viewer votes, he did not make it through the first round of competition, but was invited back as a &quot;Judge&#x27;s Choice Wildcard&quot;, where his performance earned him a place in the final 12. The competition concluded in November 2004 with Callea finishing as runner-up to Casey Donovan.

Callea was immediately signed to Sony/BMG Records, and released &quot;The Prayer&quot; as his debut single in December 2004. It debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number one and was certified four times platinum, selling in excess of 280,000 copies. In 2010 ARIA named it as the second-highest selling single of the last decade.

===2005–2007: Self-titled album and &quot;A New Chapter&quot;===
In March 2005, Callea released the double A-side &quot;Rain&quot;/&quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, which spent two weeks at number one on the ARIA chart and was certified 2× Platinum.

==Personal life==
On 27 March 2007, after speculation and tabloid rumours dating back to his &quot;Idol&quot; appearances, Callea publicly acknowledged that he is gay by issuing a statement confirming his sexuality and thanking his fans and his then-partner, Paul Riggio, who worked as a talent coordinator on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; during Anthony&#x27;s run on the show.
&quot;Yes, I am gay&quot;, Callea said. &quot;I have no issue with my sexuality now, but it&#x27;s taken time to become confident with who I am and happy with who I am. I&#x27;m comfortable enough to come clean now. It&#x27;s a weight off my shoulders&quot;.
On 30 March 2007, then Justice of the High Court of Australia Michael Kirby (who is also openly gay) described Callea as an &quot;admirable Australian&quot; for coming out. Justice Kirby added, &quot;In terms of influencing popular culture and understanding of the reality of human sexual diversity, I would trade ten judges for one popular singer.&quot;

Callea has also admitted to suffering from depression in his teenage years, saying, &quot;I went through major depression. I hated myself. I had to see a psychologist. I wasn&#x27;t talking to anybody. My parents didn&#x27;t know what was wrong with me.&quot; Callea has since supported beyondblue, an Australian initiative against depression, by contributing his version of a Brian McKnight song, &quot;Home&quot;, to a compilation album, &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1119619" wikidata="Q48293" url="?curid=1119619" title="Alta Gracia">
<text>Alta Gracia is a city located in the north-centre of the province of Córdoba, Argentina. Its name means &quot;High Grace&quot;. It is built upon the &quot;Sierras Chicas&quot;, in a region that the Comechingón Indians used to call &quot;Paravachasca&quot;. It has about 43,000 inhabitants ().

== History ==
In the 17th century, Alta Gracia was a large ranch (an &quot;estancia&quot;) operated by Jesuits. It had been first owned in 1588 by Don Juan Nieto who began the colonization of the area. Under the terms of his &quot;encomienda&quot;, Nieto began promoting the building of houses, ranches and stone pens. The Jesuits used Alta Gracia, along with other ranches, including Colonia Caroya, Jesús María, Santa Catalina, La Candelaria, and San Ignacio de los Ejercicios, to support the &quot;Collegium Maximum&quot; or &quot;Colegio Máximo&quot;, one of Argentina&#x27;s first universities (&quot;Universitas Cortuba Tucumanæ&quot;) today: Universidad Nacional de Córdoba.

Together with other educational institutes, it is now part of the &quot;Manzana Jesuítica&quot; (&quot;Jesuit Block&quot;), an important center in Córdoba City. The Jesuit Block and Estancias of Córdoba were named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.

Owners of the &quot;Estancia&quot; Alta Gracia:
* Don Juan Nieto, 1588
* Alonso Nieto de Herrera, who named it after &quot;Nuestra Señora de Alta Gracia&quot;
* The Society of Jesus (donated to them by Alonso Nieto)
* Santiago de Liniers, 1810, who lived there for about 5 months
* José Manuel Solares, 1868 (last owner; in his will he converted the estancia to a village, to be called &quot;La Merced&quot;. He divided the land into plots to give to his employees. The condition was that they would keep the Tajamar and continue with veneration of the Virgin, known as &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Merced&quot; - &quot;Our Lady of Merced&quot;.) September 24 is a feast day in Alta Gracia, in honour of the Virgin.

== Main sights==
Sights include:
* The museum of Santiago de Liniers.
* &quot;El Tajamar&quot;, a man-made lake.
* &quot;El Obraje&quot;, a workshop were the Jesuits taught many Indians the different crafts.
* The Sierras Hotel, which John F. Kennedy has visited.
* A house where revolutionary Che Guevara used to live, now a museum.
* Manuel de Falla&#x27;s Museum.

 char =formula_4|
In probability and statistics, the Yule–Simon distribution is a discrete probability distribution named after Udny Yule and Herbert A. Simon. Simon originally called it the Yule distribution.

The probability mass function (pmf) of the Yule–Simon (&quot;ρ&quot;) distribution is

:formula_5

for integer formula_6 and real formula_7, where formula_8 is the beta function. Equivalently the pmf can be written in terms of the rising factorial as

:formula_9

where formula_10 is the gamma function. Thus, if formula_11 is an integer,

:formula_12

The parameter formula_11 can be estimated using a fixed point algorithm.

The probability mass function &quot;f&quot; has the property that for sufficiently large &quot;k&quot; we have

:formula_14
This means that the tail of the Yule–Simon distribution is a realization of Zipf&#x27;s law: formula_15 can be used to model, for example, the relative frequency of the formula_16th most frequent word in a large collection of text, which according to Zipf&#x27;s law is inversely proportional to a (typically small) power of formula_16.

==Occurrence==

The Yule–Simon distribution arose originally as the limiting distribution of a particular model studied by Udny Yule in 1925 to analyze the growth in the number of species per genus in some higher taxa of biotic organisms. The Yule model makes use of two related Yule processes, where a Yule process is defined as a continuous time birth process which starts with one or more individuals. Yule proved that when time goes to infinity, the limit distribution of the number of species in a genus selected uniformly at random has a specific form and exhibits a power-law behavior in its tail. Thirty years later, the Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon proposed a time-discrete preferential attachment model to describe the appearance of new words in a large piece of a text. Interestingly enough, the limit distribution of the number of occurrences of each word, when the number of words diverges, coincides with that of the number of species belonging to the randomly chosen genus in the Yule model, for a specific choice of the parameters. This fact explains the designation Yule–Simon distribution that is commonly assigned to that limit distribution. In the context of random graphs, the Barabási–Albert model also exhibits an asymptotic degree distribution that equals the Yule–Simon distribution in correspondence of a specific choice of the parameters and still presents power-law characteristics for more general choices of the parameters. The same happens also for other preferential attachment random graph models.

The preferential attachment process can also be studied as an urn process in which balls are added to a growing number of urns, each ball being allocated to an urn with probability linear in the number (of balls) the urn already contains.

The distribution also arises as a compound distribution, in which the parameter of a geometric distribution is treated as a function of random variable having an exponential distribution. Specifically, assume that formula_18 follows an exponential distribution with scale formula_19 or rate formula_11:

:formula_21

with density

:formula_22

Then a Yule–Simon distributed variable &quot;K&quot; has the following geometric distribution conditional on &quot;W&quot;:

: formula_23

The pmf of a geometric distribution is

:formula_24

for formula_25. The Yule–Simon pmf is then the following exponential-geometric compound distribution:

:formula_26

The maximum likelihood estimator for the parameter formula_27 given the observations formula_28 is the solution to the fixed point equation

:formula_29
where formula_30 are the rate and shape parameters of the gamma distribution prior on formula_31.

This algorithm is derived by Garcia by directly optimizing the likelihood. Roberts and Roberts

generalize the algorithm to Bayesian settings with the compound geometric formulation described above. Additionally, Roberts and Roberts are able to use the Expectation Maximisation (EM) framework to show convergence of the fixed point algorithm. Moreover, Roberts and Roberts derive the sub-linearity of the convergence rate for the fixed point algorithm. Additionally, they use the EM formulation to give 2 alternate derivations of the standard error of the estimator from the fixed point equation. The variance of the formula_32 estimator is

:formula_33 
the standard error is the square root of the quantity of this estimate divided by N.

==Generalizations==

The two-parameter generalization of the original Yule distribution replaces the beta function with an incomplete beta function. The probability mass function of the generalized Yule–Simon(&quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;α&quot;) distribution is defined as

:formula_34

with formula_35. For formula_36 the ordinary Yule–Simon(&quot;ρ&quot;) distribution is obtained as a special case. The use of the incomplete beta function has the effect of introducing an exponential cutoff in the upper tail.

<text>Cordelia Gray is a fictional character created by English author P. D. James. Gray is the protagonist of two novels, &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot; (1972) and of &quot;The Skull Beneath the Skin&quot; (1982). Cordelia Gray is a young woman who works as a private detective in London, having inherited the detective agency &quot;Pryde&quot; on the death of her boss, Bernie Pryde, who committed suicide.

==Fictional character biography==
Cordelia lost her mother an hour after birth. Her father Redvers, a Marxist traveling poet and revolutionary, did not really care about his daughter, so Cordelia had many adoptive parents, and from six to eight years old she lived in a cottage in Remford with Mrs. Gibson and her children. At eleven, she was confused with another C. Gray and won a scholarship to the Convent of Infant Jesus, where she stayed for six years. Then Redvers took her away from the convent, and they started traveling in Germany and Italy with Mr. Gray&#x27;s revolutionary friends. During their wandering, Cordelia worked as their maid, cook, bellhop and nurse.

Six months later, Mr. Gray died of a heart disease in Rome. After his death, Cordelia returned to England and became the secretary of the private detective Bernie G. Pryde, and later his partner in investigations. Two months later, Pryde was diagnosed with cancer and committed suicide. Instead of selling the detective agency off, Cordelia decided to keep it open, helped by the young aspiring actor Bevis and the old secretary Mrs. Maudsley. Despite dealing with cases involving murders and threats, the agency becomes specialized in searching for missing animals.

At the conclusion of &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot;, Cordelia Gray meets James&#x27;s other detective Adam Dalgliesh. In &quot;A Taste for Death&quot; it is mentioned that they have been seen dining together. Cordelia is also referred to at the beginning and at the end of another Dalgliesh novel, &quot;The Black Tower&quot;: 

Daniel asked [about Dalgliesh]:
&quot;Is he conscious?&quot;
&quot;Barely. Your chap in there says he&#x27;s been quoting &quot;King Lear&quot;. Something about Cordelia anyway ...&quot;
==Personality==
Cordelia lives near Thames Street in an apartment with furniture bought from second-hand dealers or during auctions in the suburbs.

At first shy and unconfident, as the story progresses she learns how to solve a case and becomes methodical and serious. A stoic girl, she deals with the suicide of Bernie calmly. Whilst she seems to like order and knowledge, and seems as though she remains focused to the task, during many occasions within &quot;The Skull Beneath the Skin&quot; she becomes somewhat superficial and conscious of her appearance, compared to that of the more privileged of her clients. Cordelia loves travelling and reading, and is jealous of her privacy. She is a decent shooter. Despite being educated in a Catholic convent, she is not a strong believer.

==Adaptations==
===Television===
Cordelia Gray was first portrayed by Pippa Guard in the 1982 television adaptation of &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot; directed by Chris Petit. 

In four separate feature-length dramas comprise the ITV&#x27;s HTV series (also called &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot;), Cordelia Gray was portrayed by Helen Baxendale.
*&quot;Sacrifice&quot; was first broadcast from 24 October to 7 November 1997, consisting of three separate 60-minute episodes.
*&quot;A Last Embrace&quot; was first broadcast from 19 February to 5 March 1998, also consisting of three separate 60-minute episodes.
*&quot;Living on Risk&quot; was first broadcast on 27 August 1999, as one 120-minute episode.
*&quot;Playing God&quot; was first broadcast on 16 May 2001, as one 120-minute episode.

===BBC Radio===
The books have both been adapted for BBC Radio 4. &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot; starred Judi Bowker as Cordelia, while &quot;The Skull Beneath the Skin&quot; featured Greta Scacchi in the role.

==Other appearances==
Gray was highlighted in volume 14 of the &quot;Detective Conan&quot; manga&#x27;s edition of &quot;Gosho Aoyama&#x27;s Mystery Library&quot;, a section of the graphic novels where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from mystery literature, television, or other media. Her name was also used to create a cover name for one of the series&#x27; main characters, Ai Haibara: as stated by professor Hiroshi Agasa in volume 18, the kanji meaning &quot;gray&quot; in her surname is a tribute to Cordelia.

<text>In Christianity, the word of wisdom is a spiritual gift listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8. The function that this gift is given varies. Some Christians see in this gift a prophetic-like function. Others see in the word of wisdom a teaching function. This gift is closely related with the gift of the word of knowledge.

==Description==
Commentators have often placed this gift within the larger context of the biblical wisdom tradition, especially references to God’s secret wisdom in 1 Corinthians 2:6-10 and elsewhere in the letter. The secret wisdom pertains to the Gospel that Paul preached. This wisdom relates to that which God had previously hidden and destined for the glory of believers. It is a wisdom that speaks of those things that God has prepared for those who love him. These emphases from the broader context of the Corinthian letter could imply that the word of wisdom involves insight into God&#x27;s plan of salvation and the proclamation of Christ crucified.

Commentators have noted both a prophetic and a teaching character to the word of wisdom. Among Charismatics, the gift is often defined as a revelation of the Holy Spirit that applies scriptural wisdom to a specific situation that a Christian community faces. According to Pentecostal theologian Donald Gee, &quot;One is deeply conscious that the supremely right thing has been said and the true course of action indicated. No further appeal is desired because the heart rests in a calm satisfaction that the will of God has been revealed&quot;. 

Some commentators translate the term as &quot;teaching of wisdom&quot; and prefer to focus on the gift&#x27;s function in teaching the truths of scripture. &quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; defines it as &quot;the grace of propounding the Faith effectively, of bringing home to the minds and hearts of the listener with Divine persuasiveness, the hidden mysteries and the moral precepts of Christianity&quot;. Donald Gee writes:

<text>Not Fragile is the third studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO), released in 1974. It proved to be the group&#x27;s most popular studio album, and reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Description==
In a 1995 interview, Randy Bachman indicated that he thought that using the word &quot;fragile&quot; as a title for a rock album, as Yes had done with their 1971 album &quot;Fragile&quot;, was &quot;strange.&quot; He thought that BTO music could be &quot;dropped and kicked&quot; without breaking, so, without intending any commentary about Yes, the band &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; called their next album &quot;Not Fragile&quot;.

The album marks the debut of guitarist Blair Thornton, who, unlike his predecessor Tim Bachman, is billed on the album liner notes as &quot;second lead guitar&quot;. Thornton&#x27;s dual-guitar work with Randy Bachman is a prominent feature on many &quot;Not Fragile&quot; tracks. &quot;Roll On Down the Highway&quot; and &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; were hit singles, with the latter hitting No. 1 on the Canadian and US singles charts in November 1974, receiving GOLD certification by the RIAA. Other cuts had significant airplay on FM rock radio. The album produced the only BTO singles to chart in the United Kingdom. &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; hit No. 2 on the UK charts in November 1974, and &quot;Roll On Down the Highway&quot; hit the No. 22 position in January 1975.

&quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; was a leftover track that was not originally intended to be included on &quot;Not Fragile&quot;. It was only after Charlie Fach of Mercury Records heard the other eight tracks, and did not see hit single potential in any of them, that he asked if the band had anything else he could hear. They played him the leftover track and he assured them it was more radio-friendly than any of the others, convincing the band to add it to the album.

The &quot;Not Fragile&quot; album contains the only instrumental track in BTO&#x27;s discography, a Blair Thornton composition called &quot;Free Wheelin&#x27;&quot;. This track would appear as the B-side to the &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; single.

&quot;Not Fragile&quot; has gone on to achieve triple platinum status. Randy Bachman has called it the band&#x27;s &quot;crowning achievement,&quot; stating: &quot;&quot;Not Fragile&quot; was when it all came together for us. We captured the album-oriented rock audience as well as the singles audience with that album. &quot;Not Fragile&quot; made BTO recognized around the world.&quot;

<text>John Robinson Pierce (March 27, 1910 – April 2, 2002), was an American engineer and author. He did extensive work concerning radio communication, microwave technology, computer music, psychoacoustics, and science fiction. Additionally to his professional career he wrote science fiction for many years using the names John Pierce, John R. Pierce, and J. J. Coupling. Born in Des Moines, Iowa, he earned his PhD from Caltech, and died in Sunnyvale, California, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s Disease.

==At Bell Labs==

Pierce wrote about electronics and information theory, and developed jointly the concept of pulse-code modulation (PCM) with his Bell Laboratories colleagues Bernard M. Oliver and Claude Shannon. He supervised the Bell Labs team which built the first transistor, and at the request of one of them, Walter Brattain, invented the term &quot;transistor&quot;; he recalled:

Pierce&#x27;s early work at Bell Labs concerned vacuum tubes of all sorts. During World War II he discovered the work of Rudolf Kompfner in a British radar laboratory, where Kompfner had invented the traveling-wave tube; Pierce worked out the mathematics for this broadband amplifier device, and wrote a book about it, after hiring Kompfner for Bell Labs. He later recounted that &quot;Rudy Kompfner invented the traveling-wave tube, but I discovered it.&quot; According to Kompfner&#x27;s book, the statement &quot;Rudi invented the traveling-wave tube, and John discovered it&quot; was due to Dr. Eugene G. Fubini, quoted in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; &quot;Profile&quot; on Pierce, September 21, 1963.

Pierce is widely credited for saying &quot;Nature abhors a vacuum tube&quot;, but Pierce attributed that quip to Myron Glass. Others say that quip was &quot;commonly heard at the Bell Laboratories prior to the invention of the transistor&quot;.

Other famous Pierce quips are &quot;Funding artificial intelligence is real stupidity&quot;, &quot;I thought of it the first time I saw it&quot;, and &quot;After growing wildly for years, the field of computing appears to be reaching its infancy.&quot;

The National Inventors Hall of Fame has honored Bernard M. Oliver 
and Claude Shannon 
as the inventors of PCM,
as described in &#x27;Communication System Employing Pulse Code Modulation,&#x27; filed in 1946 and 1952, granted in 1956. Another patent by the same title was filed by John Pierce in 1945, and issued in 1948: . The three of them published &quot;The Philosophy of PCM&quot; in 1948.

Pierce did significant research involving satellites, including an important role as executive director of Bell&#x27;s Research-Communications Principles Division)
for the development of the first commercial communications satellite, Telstar 1.
In fact, although Arthur C. Clarke was the first to propose geostationary communications satellites, Pierce seems to have thought of the idea independently and may have been the first to discuss &quot;unmanned&quot; communications satellites. Clarke himself characterized Pierce as &quot;one of the two fathers of the communications satellite&quot; (along with Harold Rosen). See ECHO – America&#x27;s First Communications Satellite (reprinted from SMEC Vintage Electrics Volume 2 #1) for some details on his original contributions.

Pierce directed the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee that produced the ALPAC report, which had the effect of curtailing most funding for work on machine translation during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

== Life after Bell Labs ==
After quitting Bell Laboratories, he joined California Institute of Technology as a professor of electrical engineering in 1971. Soon thereafter, he also accepted the position of Chief Engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

In 1980 he retired from Caltech and accepted his final job at Stanford&#x27;s CCRMA. There he was prominent in the research of computer music, as a Visiting Professor of Music, Emeritus (along with John Chowning and Max Mathews). It was at Stanford that he became an independent co-discoverer of the non-octave musical scale that he later named the Bohlen–Pierce scale.

Many of Pierce&#x27;s technical books were intended to introduce a semi-technical audience to modern technical topics. Among them are &quot;Electrons, Waves, and Messages&quot;; &quot;An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals, and Noise&quot;; &quot;Waves and Ear&quot;; &quot;Man&#x27;s World of Sound&quot;; &quot;Quantum Electronics&quot;; and &quot;Signals: The Science of Telecommunication&quot;.

Pierce was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1955. In 1960, Pierce was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal. In 1962, Pierce received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. That same year, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1963, Pierce received the IEEE Edison Medal for &quot;his pioneer work and leadership in satellite communications and for his stimulus and contributions to electron optics, travelling wave tube theory, and the control of noise in electron streams&quot;. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1973. In 1975, he received the IEEE Medal of Honor for &quot;his pioneering concrete proposals and the realization of satellite communication experiments, and for contributions in theory and design of traveling wave tubes and in electron beam optics essential to this success.&quot; In 1985, he was one of the first two recipients of the Japan Prize &quot;for outstanding achievement in the field of electronics and communications technologies&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Besides his technical books, Pierce wrote science fiction using the pseudonym J.J. Coupling, which refers to the total angular momenta of individual particles. John Pierce also had an early interest in gliding and assisted the development of the Long Beach Glider Club in Los Angeles, one of the earliest glider societies in the United States. According to Richard Hamming &quot;you couldn&#x27;t talk to John Pierce without being stimulated very quickly&quot;.

Pierce had been a resident of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, Pasadena, California, and later of Palo Alto, California.

During his later years, as a visiting professor at Stanford University&#x27;s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, he and his wife Brenda were known for having dinner parties in their Palo Alto home, in which they would invite an eclectic variety of guests and have lively discussions concerning topics ranging from space exploration to politics, health care, and 20th-century music. One such dinner party was reported in This Is Your Brain On Music, written by Pierce&#x27;s former student Daniel Levitin.

The papers of John R. Pierce are at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.

At his death Pierce was survived by his wife Brenda; a son—science fiction editor John Jeremy Pierce—and a daughter, Elizabeth Anne Pierce.

<text>The Four Wheel Drive Auto Company, more often known as Four Wheel Drive (FWD), was a pioneering American company that developed and produced all-wheel drive vehicles. It was founded in 1909 in Clintonville, Wisconsin, as the Badger Four-Wheel Drive Auto Company by Otto Zachow and William Besserdich. The first production facility was built in 1911 and was designed by architect Wallace W. DeLong of Appleton, Wisconsin.

FWD renamed FWD Corporation and its associates Seagrave, Baker Aerialscope, and Almonte Fire Trucks were sold in 2003 to an investment group headed by former American LaFrance executive James Hebe. Today, the Seagrave Fire Apparatus group is a flagship company of ELB Capital Management.

==History==

Zachow and Besserdich developed and built their first successful four-wheel drive (4x4) car, the &quot;Battleship&quot;, in 1908. Its success led to the founding of the company. &quot;Badger&quot; was dropped from the name in 1910. Besserdich and Zachow&#x27;s patented full time four wheel drive system combined a lockable center differential with double-Y constant velocity universal joints for steering. In modern terms the &quot;Battleship&quot; would be considered all wheel drive, as all FWD products featured full-time four wheel drive with a lockable center differential.

The success of the four-wheel drive in early military tests prompted the company to switch from cars to trucks. In 1916 the U.S. Army ordered 147 Model B three ton trucks for the Pancho Villa Expedition. The U.S. Army ordered 15,000 FWD Model B three ton trucks as the &quot;Truck, 3 ton, Model 1917&quot; during World War I with over 14,000 actually delivered; additional orders came from the United Kingdom and Russia. In two world wars, U.S. and allied armies depended on such four-wheel drive vehicles. Numerous FWD model B trucks, both military and civilian, survive in working condition; a Model 1917 U.S. Army truck in working condition is on display at the Fort MacArthur Military Museum, San Pedro, Los Angeles, California.

Early FWD vehicles were made with a track width of so they could quickly be used on a standard gauge railway line merely by changing the wheels.

The FWD Model B was produced under license by four additional manufacturers during World War I: Peerless Motor Company, Cleveland, Ohio; Kissel Motor Car Company, Hartford, Wisconsin; Premier Motor Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana; and Mitchell Motor Car Company, Racine, Wisconsin.

Three FWD Model B trucks were included in the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. According to 1st Lt. E. R. Jackson, the official Ordnance Department observer: &quot;The three (3) Four Wheel Drive Trucks were, in general, the most satisfactory in the Convoy and of all of the various makes represented, the F.W.D.&#x27;s alone were able to pull through &quot;all&quot; of the bad, muddy, and sandy stretches of road in Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah and Nevada absolutely unaided.&quot; (emphasis in the original.)
A Canadian subsidiary was set up in conjunction with Dominion Truck of Kitchener, Ontario by 1919.

A British subsidiary was set up at Slough in 1921. In 1926, the British FWD, also known as the Jeffery Quad, was produced with a larger 70 bhp engine.

A relationship with premier race car constructor Harry Miller resulted in the Four Wheel Drive Miller that competed successfully at the Indianapolis 500 in 1931 and later. This car was intended to demonstrate that the advantages FWD&#x27;s lockable center differential were not limited to off-road driving. One example survives and has competed in premier vintage race car meets such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed. &quot;The Last Great Miller&quot; by Griffith Borgeson gives a complete history of this landmark car.

In 1932, AEC took a controlling interest in the British company and began to use more standard AEC components in the Slough-built vehicles. To distinguish these from imported U.S. FWD vehicles, they were marketed under the name Hardy. Production ceased about 1936, but AEC exploited its experience with all-wheel drive in its Second World War Matador (4x4) and Marshall (6x6) vehicles.

In 1939, the company formed a flight department. Their acquisition of a used Waco biplane would eventually evolve into North Central Airlines. 
During the Second World War the &quot;Four Wheel Drive Model HAR-1&quot;, a 4-Ton, 4x4 Truck, was produced and delivered to the US-Army. The US Army placed an order and between 7,000 and 9,000 were produced for them, although most of these were supplied to allies under Lend-Lease. 

In 1958, the company&#x27;s name was changed to FWD Corporation.

In 1963, FWD acquired Seagrave Fire Apparatus who then moved from their old location in Columbus, Ohio, to their current location at FWD in Clintonville, Wisconsin. Many tower ladders in the 1990s using Seagrave chassis were branded as FWD. They used Baker Aerialscopes for the boom which FWD had also acquired over the years along with Almonte Fire Trucks.

Randolph Lenz, chairman of FWD&#x27;s parent company, Corsta Corp., became embroiled in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation suit, and in 2003 all assets of FWD, FWD Corporation, Seagrave, Baker Aerialscope, and Almonte Fire Trucks were sold to an investment group headed by former American LaFrance executive James Hebe. Today, the Seagrave Fire Apparatus group is a flagship company of ELB Capital Management.

<doc id="1119659" wikidata="Q7574846" url="?curid=1119659" title="Special paint schemes on racing cars">
<text>Special paint schemes are one-time or limited time variations on a race car&#x27;s typical appearance. Their use has historically been largely confined to NASCAR stock car racing, partially due to the much larger surface area of a stock car, and longer season, but have entered the IndyCar in a limited fashion. NASCAR&#x27;s increased media coverage has contributed to their popularity with both fans and sponsors.

However, some sponsors and die-cast makers have advanced the promotion to other codes of motorsport, as Red Bull Racing had a &quot;Star Wars&quot; paint scheme to promote &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; in Formula One and a similar Superman one to promote &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. Panther Racing in the Indy Racing League ran a Pennzoil Platinum paint scheme at selected 2005 IRL events instead of the normal yellow design.

==History==

===1991 Daytona 500: Winston Salutes the Troops===

Special paint schemes in NASCAR date back to the 1991 Daytona 500. As part of an R. J. Reynolds promotion, five unsponsored drivers had paint schemes on their cars that paid tribute to the branches of the United States Armed Forces serving in Operation Desert Storm:

* No. 7: Alan Kulwicki – Army
* No. 18: Greg Sacks – Navy
* No. 24: Mickey Gibbs – Air Force
* No. 71: Dave Marcis – Coast Guard
* No. 88: Buddy Baker – Marines

===Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s &quot;Quick Silver&quot;===
Alternate paint schemes truly gained notoriety in 1995, when Dale Earnhardt appeared at The Winston with a silver car (in tribute to Winston&#x27;s silver anniversary) instead of his traditional black car. The car was nicknamed &quot;Quick Silver&quot; or &quot;Silver Select&quot;. A year later, Earnhardt continued the trend at the 1996 running of &quot;The Winston&quot; with a 1996 Atlanta Olympics themed car.

Fan reaction to the paint schemes proved popular such that by the end of the decade, scarcely a race went by without one or more drivers sporting a special paint scheme. Often one-week special sponsorship deals were involved in the schemes, and other times existing sponsors chose to promote alternate products within the firm. Examples of one-week deals include promoting first run films coinciding with the particular race weekend, and promoting other simultaneous events (such as the Olympics).

Often several drivers sported related paint schemes simultaneously.

==Popular themes==
Custom paint schemes frequently feature special events, and often include the following:

* An associate sponsor becomes the primary sponsor for selected races.
** Often, if that associate sponsor is sponsoring the race, they will have primary sponsorship for that race.
* Sports teams (especially during special promotions)
** During the 2001 MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400, the MBNA-sponsored No. 18 driven by Bobby Labonte drove a special Ripken-themed Pontiac Grand Prix. The Baltimore Orioles game that night was scheduled as Ripken&#x27;s last home game until games were rescheduled because of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Ripken was grand marshal, started the race, and the race winner was to attend that game.
**At the 2007 Lenox Industrial Tools 300, Carl Edwards used a Boston Red Sox-based car in celebration of Jack Roush partnering with Fenway Sports Group, headquartered in New England. The next year, David Ragan had a Bosox-based car.
**InBev, the sponsor of the George Gillett-owned No. 9 Ford Fusion driven by Kasey Kahne, fielded a white car with a mountainous motif featuring the Olympic rings as part of the Belgian brewer&#x27;s sponsorship of the United States Olympic team at the 2010 Winter Olympics. This paint scheme was used only for the races that were held during the length of the Olympic Games.
* Charities
** During the 2010 All-Star race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Dale Earnhardt Jr. ran a special paint scheme featuring the JR Foundation Logo on the hood, to commemorate this occasion. The design was reintroduced for the 2012 All-Star race.
** The Home Depot often fielded a Kaboom-themed car for Joey Logano and Tony Stewart during their tenures with Joe Gibbs Racing.
** Lowe&#x27;s fields a &quot;Power of Pride&quot; car with the USO as a benefactor.
** Dale Jarrett raced a &quot;reverse&quot; paint scheme in 1999 where his entire car&#x27;s colour scheme was reversed for breast cancer research.
* Cartoon Characters
** The Muppets were featured on a special series during a 2002 race at the Chicagoland Speedway.
** The Looney Tunes were used as part of a promotion with the September race at Richmond International Raceway with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo 400 in 2001 and 2002.
* Rock Bands
** During the time that Chevrolet sponsored the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond International Raceway, some of the cars featured paint schemes based on popular rock bands.
** 3 Doors Down has also been featured on several NASCAR cars before with Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 2008 for the NASCAR Sprint All Star Race and Tony Stewart in the Nationwide Series in 2003 for a race at Michigan International Speedway.

==Movie themes==

The use of movie-themed cars is viewed as being perfectly suited to promotion through the use of special paint schemes due to the short-term nature of a movie&#x27;s box office run.

Often, a sponsor is involved in a movie, and to promote the movie, they will deal with the movie producers to have their car painted to reflect the movie. Other times, a film studio will work with a driver to have the movie theme.

===List of notable movie themes===
*&quot;Toy Story (&quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;)
*&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;: An advertisement for this movie was placed on the hood of Bobby Labonte&#x27;s car at the 2004 Daytona 500
*&quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;: Special paint scheme was driven once by Jamie McMurray
*&quot;Hulk&quot;
*&quot;Shrek&quot; (&quot;2&quot;, and &quot;The Third&quot;): For the former, special paint schemes were driven by Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart at the 2004 Coca-Cola 600. For &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, special paint schemes were used in 2007 by David Gilliland and Tony Raines.
*&quot;Shark Tale&quot;
*&quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;: Jimmie Johnson &amp; Kyle Busch drove this scheme in a fall Busch race at Lowe&#x27;s in 2004.
*&quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot;: Kasey Kahne in the 2007 Pepsi 400
*&quot;Batman Forever&quot;: Bill Elliott drove such a promotion paint job in 1995.
*&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;: Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart at several 2001 races, as well as Jeff Gordon in the 1997 All-Star Race. Gordon&#x27;s 1997 All-Star Race winner is known as &quot;T-Rex&quot; that dominated the race and was effectively banned by NASCAR afterwards.
*&quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (NASCAR and IRL special paint schemes). Kyle Busch won the Dodge Challenger 500 in 2008 with the movie on the car.
*&quot;Click&quot;: Driven by Kasey Kahne to victory at Michigan in 2006.
*&quot;&quot;: Special paint scheme was driven by Dale Jarrett in 2005 at Infineon.
*&quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;: Dale Earnhardt Jr. drove and won the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan in a car painted to promote &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;.
*&quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;: This promotional paint job was used by Jeff Gordon at the 2005 Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega, which he won.
*&quot;Minions (film)&quot;: In the 2015 Quaker State 400 at Kentucky Speedway, Carl Edwards drove the paint scheme to promote the Despicable Me spinoff movie.
*&quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;: In the 2016 Auto Club 400, Dale Earnhardt Jr. (Batman) and Jimmie Johnson (Superman) drive specially themed cars. Johnson won with his Superman theme.
*&quot;Cars 3&quot;: Kyle Larson drove the paint scheme in 2017 to promote the movie. He won the race at Michigan with this scheme. Clint Bowyer ran a &quot;Cars 3&quot; scheme at Sonoma 2 weeks later as well, finishing 2nd.

==Throwback themes==

Following trends in other sports, &quot;throwback&quot; paint schemes have also gained popularity in recent years, celebrating past accomplishments of well-known drivers.

===List of notable throwback themes===
* Harry Gant
** For the 1994 Hooters 500, his final race, the car was based on a 1981 paint scheme with Burt Reynolds and Hal Needham.
* Darrell Waltrip
** To celebrate 25 years since his first Winston Cup race (1972), during the 1997 season, he had cars painted to resemble different cars during his career. A special chrome car was also designed.
** Has been the subject of various throwback designs by various teams, most notably Hendrick Motorsports (the team where he won his Daytona 500), though none of the Hendrick throwbacks reflected on his time at Hendrick.
* Jeff Gordon
** In celebrating his distinguished career at the 2004 Nextel All-Star Challenge, his car was painted to resemble the 1992–2000 original DuPont &quot;Rainbow Warriors,&quot; complete with the DuPont logo and &quot;Automotive Finishes&quot; on the side of the car, instead of the &quot;DUPONT&quot; design on the sides used from 2001-12 (the last race with DuPont; those logos belong to Dow as of 2017). Axalta, the successor company to DuPont Performance Coatings (spun off in 2013), ran the same 1992-2000 livery with the current Axalta logo and text on the cars at the 2015 Irwin Tools Night Race for his final full-time season. The livery was again used in 2018 by Hendrick Motorsports with current No. 24 driver William Byron at Darlington, which is the series&#x27; retro round.
** To celebrate the debut of &quot;Pepsi Throwback&quot;, Gordon drove in a replica of Waltrip&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Pepsi Challenger&quot; at the 2009 Aaron&#x27;s 499, which was involved in an early crash on lap 8. Ironically, Waltrip did not drive the yellow Pepsi Challenger design in that spring Talladega event during the 1983 season, instead opting for a white design. (Pepsi used the yellow Pepsi Challenger livery for other motorsport teams at the time. most notably All American Racers in CART and Don Prudhomme in NHRA.)
** At the 2016 Darlington retro round, he drove a Buddy Baker &quot;Grey Ghost&quot; scheme. The 2016 Gordon Darlington car became a theme Dale Earnhardt Jr. drove at the 2017 October Martinsville race, except it used contemporary logos.
** At the 2019 Darlington Xfinity retro round, Michael Annett and sponsor Pilot Flying J had a 1992 Bill Davis Racing Baby Ruth Ford based livery on the JR Motorsports No. 1 Chevrolet. Despite the retro scheme, the car used current logos, including the Baby Ruth (which is being redone after its new owners, Ferrero Group) and Pilot Flying J logos.
* Jimmie Johnson
** In 2018, to commemorate the final races of Lowe&#x27;s Home Improvement Warehouse with Johnson and Hendrick Motorsports, the No. 48 Chevrolet Camaro used a series of throwback liveries. Those included the 2012 Kobalt car at Darlington (Hendrick&#x27;s 200th win car), the 2001 debut car (Charlotte) at Phoenix, the rookie car from 2002 at Homestead.
** In 2019, at the Darlington round, a Nelson &amp; Nelson Racing Chevrolet Thunder off-road truck livery from his days driving off-road racing was used.
** In 2020, during his final season, Hendrick Motorsports worked three Johnson schemes into the throwback round while Johnson himself drove a scheme designed to celebrate the sport&#x27;s three seven-time champions.
*** William Byron drove Liberty University-sponsored car with a livery designed to be the 2013 Holden Commodore used to win the All-Star Race.
*** Chase Elliott drove a NAPA Auto Parts Camaro designed to resemble Johnson&#x27;s 2009 Cup Series winning Chevrolet Impala.
*** Alex Bowman drove a Chevrolet designed to resemble Johnson&#x27;s 2006 Cup Series winning Chevrolet Monte Carlo (his first championship season).
* Molson Coors (all brands)
** Bill Elliott drove the 2005 Bud Shootout with Chip Ganassi Racing in a No. 39 Coors Dodge with 1985-88 era Coors livery.
** During Rusty Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Last Call&quot; tour in 2005, one of his cars featured the 1991–1995 Miller Genuine Draft black and gold paint scheme, complete with graphics replete of that era. 
** At the 2015 Pure Michigan 400, Team Penske had Brad Keselowski, who now drove the Miller Lite Ford, drive the car in the Miller Genuine Draft livery as part of the 25 years of Miller and Penske celebration. The same design was used at the 2017 Rebel 500.
** At the Rebel 500 weeks later, Keselowski&#x27;s car reflected the 1983 Miller High Life Bobby Allison livery from the Southern 500 win (the last Labor Day race; in 1984, the race moved to Sunday) and the ensuing Championship season.
** At the 2018 Darlington retro round, the 1990 livery was used.
* Mark Martin
** During the 2005 &quot;Salute to You&quot; tour, cars were painted to reflect various stages of Martin&#x27;s career.
** Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing has used various liveries inspired by Martin&#x27;s career.
** Valvoline, which has been affiliated as of 2014 with Hendrick Motorsports, and Martin have authorised schemes based on his Valvoline cars at Hendrick. Alex Bowman will drive one such scheme at the 2022 retro round.
* Chevron Corporation
** Prior to pulling out in 2007, Chevron&#x27;s Texaco Havoline brand had featured special schemes to celebrate the brand&#x27;s past. Their most notable special scheme was the 1987 Ranier-Lundy &quot;Battlestar&quot; scheme of the late Davey Allison, which debuted at the 1997 Coca-Cola 600 and was later used in the DieHard 500 at the Talladega Superspeedway.
* Mountain Dew
** The 1981–82 Mountain Dew Championship Seasons of Darrell Waltrip has been used at various times for Hendrick Motorsports liveries in Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series cars.
* Richard Childress Racing
** During the 2004 UAW-GM Quality 500, to celebrate 35 years of Richard Childress Racing, the team ran three throwback schemes, with designs based on Childress schemes from the team&#x27;s first win in 1983, the team&#x27;s famed 1987 championship, and 1995 silver car).
*Dale Earnhardt Jr.
** Earnhardt raced two throwbacks in 2006. The first was dedicated to his father at the 2006 Aaron&#x27;s 499, using a black and silver paint scheme reminiscent of his father&#x27;s Goodwrench cars. The second ran at the 2006 3M Performance 400 using a cream-colored design, similar to his late grandfather Ralph Earnhardt&#x27;s 1956 Sportsman championship. The latter car had authentic-looking &quot;#8&quot; graphics from 1956, and Dale Jr&#x27;s sponsor Budweiser added 1956-era Budweiser logos.
** During the 2008 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, Earnhardt raced a car painted similar to Buddy Baker&#x27;s &quot;Grey Ghost&quot; Oldsmobile 442 that won the 1980 Daytona 500 and set a race record that still stands. 
** Various regular schemes during Earnhardt&#x27;s career at Hendrick Motorsports have influence from past cars. A later-era Baker Oldsmobile 88 scheme (Crisco) was flipped for his 2014-15 Nationwide livery, while the vertical stripes on a 1981 Wrangler scheme from his father are featured in the Windows 10 design in 2015. TaxSlayer (his father&#x27;s Wrangler, 1986–87) and Axalta (Xfinity Oreo) all will have influence from past cars in 2016.
** At the Rebel 500 retro round in 2017, his final full-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season in 2017, his 1998 Xfinity Series championship livery was used with current Nationwide decals.
** For the October 2017 Martinsville race, the Jeff Gordon Nationwide #88 scheme, except with current-era Nationwide logos, was used. (Gordon&#x27;s car carried the retro logos because it was used at Darlington.)
** For his final scheduled Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race, his 1999 scheme was used as the basis with current Axalta logos as part of a promotion with Axalta&#x27;s introduction of Cromax EZ paint. It was also the last race in the Series for the Holden VF Commodore.
** For the 2018 Xfinity Series round at Darlington, Tyler Reddick, then driving for Earnhardt, used an Old Milwaukee livery inspired by Tim Richmond&#x27;s Cup car in 1983–85, fielded by Raymond Beadle, whose son Ryan spearheaded the design as the general counsel for JR Motorsports.
** For his 2019 Xfinity Series start at Darlington, he and sponsor Unilever arranged a livery based on a vintage car his father drove to his first Cup start in 1975, with approval of Norman Negre (son of the car owner).
** Various JR Motorsports cars use liveries inspired by his career during the Darlington round.
*Chevrolet
**During the August 2007 Nextel Cup weekend at Michigan International Speedway, the cars of 11 Team Chevy drivers were decorated with special paint schemes commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1957 Chevrolet. The cars driven by Ward Burton, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Mark Martin, Casey Mears, Paul Menard, Tony Raines, Martin Truex Jr., Scott Wimmer and J.J. Yeley all sported cues from the &#x27;57 Chevy&#x27;s memorable design while J.J. Yeley&#x27;s No. 18 Monte Carlo SS displayed a throwback Interstate Batteries logo.
*Darlington Raceway
** The Rebel 500 moved from its traditional spring date to September, where the fall race (the Southern 500; note that the history of the current Darlington race dates to the lineage of the 1957 Rebel 300) was held from 1950-2003 until it moved to November in 2004 and eliminated as a result of the Ferko lawsuit, replaced by the AAA Texas 500 at the Texas Motor Speedway a year. Various teams unveiled throwback and special paint schemes as part of a promotion with the track. The weekend has become an annual throwback weekend.
*** For 2021, with the restoration of two Cup meetings at Darlington, the race was lineally returned to the spring, and the Throwback weekend moved to the spring. The fall date will become a playoff-oriented round.
** Some NASCAR Hall of Fame drivers have had multiple schemes from their career influence multiple drivers in the same race. Two teams—Wood Brothers (1976 NASCAR season) and Hendrick Motorsports (1979 Talladega 500), for example, in 2016 use David Pearson liveries on their cars.

===Response to throwback themes===

After Ernie Irvan put the throwback &quot;Battlestar&quot; on the pole at the 1997 DieHard 500, fan reaction forced Robert Yates Racing to consider having the &quot;Battlestar&quot; design at Talladega for the rest of the team&#x27;s association with Texaco. When Chevron (who had bought Texaco) switched to Chip Ganassi Racing, fan reaction forced the sponsor to revert to the old Yates-era 1994-2000 design after Chevron changed the paint scheme in 2001.

Liz Allison (Davey&#x27;s widow) told the media in announcing the 2003 Battlestar old fans would be cheering heavily when they see the classic design returning for the race, and warned Ganassi driver Jamie McMurray that if he won the race in the Battlestar, &quot;You better bar the door because the Allisons are taking over. We&#x27;re really excited and very touched (by Chevron&#x27;s generosity in remembering a legend).&quot;

==Military paint schemes==

New variations on the military paint schemes have also been used throughout the years. The United States Army began sponsoring the No. 01 car owned by MB2 Motorsports full-time in 2003. For major anniversaries, the cars used a special camouflage design. The Army then went to Dale Earnhardt, Inc. for two seasons before joining Stewart Haas Racing in 2009 and was the primary sponsor of Ryan Newman&#x27;s No. 39 until 2012.

Although the schemes were not military-based, several cars used patriotic paint schemes for the 2001 MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover, the first race after the September 11 attacks.

Often die-cast replicas of the paint scheme cars are produced for the collector market.

==Differences between special and alternating paint schemes==

With the economics of the sport dictating higher expenses, some sponsors have decided to share sponsor space with other sponsors, leading to two &quot;regular&quot; designs which alternate, such as Richard Childress Racing, where all three teams have multiple alternating primary sponsors. In 2009, the No. 29 team had Shell and Hershey, while the No. 31 had Caterpillar, AstraZeneca, and Lenox Industrial Tools, and the #07 has Jack Daniel&#x27;s, DirecTV, and BB&amp;T as their three sponsors. Other sponsors have decided to promote different products with their sponsor dollars, such as Mars (M&amp;M&#x27;s, Snickers, Skittles, Wrigley&#x27;s, Pedigree, Banfield Pet Hospitals), Lowe&#x27;s (two schemes, one standard which can be configured to promote professional services or have the regular logo, and one Kobalt Tools), and Kellogg&#x27;s with the standard Kellogg&#x27;s and Cheez-It snacks (a Kellogg&#x27;s product) schemes, and FedEx, which uses five different schemes with color differences to promote four different brands—Express, Ground, Freight, and Kinko&#x27;s. (A fifth scheme was used in 2005 at Darlington, and is a special scheme, to promote the St. Jude Hospital they support in Memphis.) Those are not &quot;special&quot; schemes, but are co-primary schemes to promote various products by a sponsor who may be willing to use the broadcasts to promote their wide variety of products.

The sheer number of special paint schemes has led to criticism that they are no longer &quot;special&quot; at all. However, it should be differentiated between alternating sponsors, different products on cars (especially promotions for special products), and the true special paint schemes, which promote special events.

==IndyCar Series==
Though not as widespread as NASCAR, cars in the IndyCar Series have also participated in special paint schemes. Most that have been used have featured a &quot;retro&quot; or tribute paint scheme, depicting a notable car from the past. In most cases, the sponsors are not the same but carry the current sponsors&#x27; decals on the classic liveries.

*1987–1991: Vince Granatelli and later UNO/Granatelli entries sported a &quot;throwback&quot; paint scheme which featured a day-glow orange, similar to that of the STP Turbine cars of the late 60s, and other Andy Granatelli entries of the early 1970s.

*2000 Indianapolis 500: Hometown rookie driver and co-owner Andy Hillenburg fielded a &quot;throwback&quot; entry named the Sumar Special, a gesture to the car driven by Pat O&#x27;Connor which won the pole position in 1957.
*2001 Indianapolis 500: Billy Boat fielded a &quot;throwback&quot; paint scheme that resembled &quot;Calhoun,&quot; the car driven by 1962 pole position winner Parnelli Jones. Boat&#x27;s car was nicknamed &quot;Calhoun II.&quot;
*2007 Indianapolis 500: Ryan Briscoe&#x27;s entry at Luczo Dragon Racing was painted in a &quot;retro&quot; paint schemes to resemble Rick Mears&#x27; 1988 Indy 500 winning car. It was the first of a small trend of similar instances.
*2008 Indianapolis 500: Marco Andretti&#x27;s car was painted to promote the movie &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, and his racing suit was designed to resemble Indiana Jones&#x27;s outfit.

==Art cars==
German manufacturer BMW has a tradition of competing with arts cars which started in the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Artists such as David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and Andy Warhol have contributed to the project. Other teams have done similar liveries, such as Aston Martin Racing and OAK Racing in the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans.

<doc id="1119660" wikidata="Q3350642" url="?curid=1119660" title="Oliver, British Columbia">
<text>Oliver is a town near the south end of the Okanagan Valley in the southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada, with a population of nearly 5,000 people. It is located along the Okanagan River by Tuc-el-nuit Lake between Osoyoos and Okanagan Falls, and is labelled as the Wine Capital of Canada by Tourism British Columbia. It was once &quot;The Home of the Cantaloupe&quot; as well as the &quot;Home of the International Horseshow.&quot;

The community of Oliver is made up of land governed by three different bodies: the Town of Oliver, the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen and the Osoyoos Indian Band.

Local industries include grape and fruit production, agritourism, wine production, ranching, golfing and recreation, retail and service trades. Some of the largest employers include Osoyoos Indian Band, School District #53, Interior Health and Okanagan Tree Fruit Cooperative.

==Origin of name==
Named after John Oliver (1856–1927), Premier of British Columbia. &quot;Honest John&quot; and his government brought irrigation water and settlement lots to the area with the South Okanagan Lands Project.

The name of the area of this locality in the native Okanagan language is &quot;N̓k̓mip&quot;.

==History==
The people of the Syilx Okanagan Nation have lived in the South Okanagan for hundreds if not thousands of years and traditionally moved throughout their large territory to follow seasonal food resources. Many of their camps and village sites were on the shores of the lakes and glacial benches throughout the area. They relied on the river, creeks and valley lakes of the Southern Okanagan for their daily lives.

The first encroachment from European immigrants came circa 1811, when fur traders came to the area with the establishment of Fort Okanagan (now in the US) and first explored the area for trade.

In the 1880s, free gold-bearing quartz was found at Camp McKinney (east of Oliver) which became a busy gold mine, attracting miners and merchants, and boasting a public transportation system. Fairview (just west of Oliver) miners found gold and fueled the growth of a boomtown but it lasted just a few years and no remnants of the town survive today, other than a heritage marker.
* Established in 1921, Oliver began as a settlement for unemployed veterans of the First World War as part of the Soldier Settlement Act of 1917. A gravity-fed canal was constructed to provide irrigation to the semi-arid area.
* On January 30, 1919, the South Okanagan Lands Project (SOLP) began work on the Intake Dam at the base of McIntyre Bluff. Over the next eight years the 23 concrete-lined miles of the main canal were dug southward to the boundary. Eighteen and a half feet across the top, five feet deep and delivering 230 cubic feet per second, SOLP designed it to enable farmers to put nearly a foot of water per month on every acre of bottom land in the southern Valley. To get the canal from the east side of the Valley to the benches on the west, the “big siphon”—now concrete, but originally a -long wood-stave pipe of six and a half-foot-diameter—was constructed. It runs directly beneath the centre of Oliver. The office of the lands project now houses the town office and the building that housed the BC Police built circa 1924 stands today as the Oliver &amp; District Museum.
*A post office, Board of Trade, and the first official business (a general store) were established in 1921 and the BC government administered the area until 1945 when the village was incorporated and a council elected. In 1990, the community&#x27;s municipal incorporation was upgraded to town, its current status.
*In 1922, electrical power was brought to Oliver by the West Kootenay Power and Light Co.
*In 1923, the Kettle Valley Railway (KVR) constructed a station in Oliver and rails to transport fruit north to Penticton. In 1931, it was leased to the Canadian Pacific Railway. The last train went through Oliver in 1977. The building now sits slightly north of its original position and houses the Oliver Tourism Association and Visitor Centre.
*In 1935, Oliver was featured in Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not for the claim that none of the dogs in Oliver had fleas.
*In 1990, Oliver held the world record for baking the world&#x27;s largest cherry pie.
*In 2002, on her Golden Jubilee Tour of Canada, Queen Elizabeth II gave the Royal assent that Oliver was the Wine Capital of Canada.
*Located east of Oliver is Area 27 Motorsports Park, which was only track over 2 miles in Canada west of Ontario until the 2020 construction of Rocky Mountain Motorsports near Carstairs, Alberta 

Oliver has been characterized by waves of migrants from different parts of the world. The first non-Indigenous settlers in the area, mostly war veterans and their families, came from the United Kingdom in the 1920s. This was followed by migration from Germany in the 1930s, and Hungarians in the 1940s and 1950s. Immigrants from Portugal arrived in Oliver starting in the 1950s, and soon owned most of the area wineries and orchards. The most recent migration has been of Sikh Canadians, many coming from the Lower Mainland and Calgary. As of 2017, Punjabi Sikhs own about 70 per cent of the area orchards and wineries.

==Administration of water==
* SOLP (1919–1964) South Okanagan Lands Project – established by the Province of BC 1921 and run by provincial government employees for over forty years. In the spring of 1964 the Oliver/Osoyoos Fruit Growers&#x27; Association was informed that the province was getting out of the irrigation business.
* SOLID (1964–1989) South Okanagan Lands and Irrigation District – On June 25, 1964 the Fruit Growers&#x27; Association volunteered itself to be the cornerstone of the locally constituted South Okanagan Lands Irrigation District which operated the system until 1989.
* Oliver Water (1989 to present) Town of Oliver – The water district was divided into two parts to be run by municipal governments. The Towns of Oliver and Osoyoos now deliver nineteen billion imperial gallons—nearly one hundred billion litres—to the Valley&#x27;s parched soils annually. 1990 saw the election of Water Councillors in both communities—a first in BC.

===Ethnicity===
Oliver has seen waves of immigration from the British Isles, Central Europe, Southern Europe, and Southern Asia since non-Indigenous settlement began approximately 100 years ago. With the construction of an irrigation canal to encourage settlement at the behest of former premier John Oliver, the community was originally built for British immigrants and veterans returning from the First World War during the 1920s. Following the initial British migration wave were Germans and Hungarians who first migrated to Oliver between the 1930s and 1950s, followed by Portuguese immigrants between the 1950s and the 1970s, and finally Punjabi Sikhs from the 1980s into the contemporary era.

Today, Oliver&#x27;s major communities – Indigenous, Portuguese, Caucasian, and Sikhs live in cultural and social silos, with little or no informal social interaction other than in schools, shopping centres and work places.

<text>Bertram David Wolfe (January 19, 1896 – February 21, 1977) was an American scholar, leading communist, and later a leading anti-communist. He authored many works related to communism, including biographical studies of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, and Diego Rivera.

==Background==

Bertram Wolfe was born January 19, 1896, in Brooklyn, New York. His mother was a native-born American and his father was an ethnic Jewish immigrant from Germany who had arrived in the United States as a boy of 13.

Wolfe studied to teach English literature and writing and received degrees from the College of the City of New York, Columbia University, and the University of Mexico.

==Career==

===Communist Party===

Wolfe was active with the Socialist Party of America in his youth and was an active participant in the Left Wing Section which emerged in 1919. Wolfe attended the June 1919 National Conference of the Left Wing and was elected by that body to its nine-member National Council. He helped draft the manifesto of that organization, together with Louis C. Fraina and John Reed.

In 1919 Wolfe became a founding member of the Communist Party of America (CPA). Together with Maximilian Cohen, Wolfe was responsible for &quot;The Communist World,&quot; the CPA&#x27;s first newspaper in New York City.

During the period of repression of leading Communists in New York conducted by the Lusk Committee, Wolfe fled to California. In 1920 he became a member of the San Francisco Cooks&#x27; Union. He also edited a left wing trade union paper called &quot;Labor Unity&quot; from 1920 to 1922. Wolfe was a delegate to the ill-fated August 1922 convention of the underground CPA held in Bridgman, Michigan, for which he was indicted under Michigan&#x27;s &quot;criminal syndicalism&quot; law.

In 1923, Wolfe departed for Mexico, where he became active in the trade union movement there. He became a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Mexico and was a delegate of that organization to the 5th World Congress of the Communist International, held in Moscow in 1924. Wolfe was also a leading member the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern) from 1924 to 1928, sitting on that body&#x27;s Executive Committee.

Wolfe was ultimately deported from Mexico to the United States in July 1925 for activities related to a strike of Mexican railway workers. Upon his return to America, Wolfe took over as head of the Party&#x27;s New York Workers School, located at 26 Union Square and offering 70 courses in the social sciences to some 1500 students.

After his return to the United States, Wolfe became a close political associate of factional leader Jay Lovestone, who became the leader of the American Communist Party following the death of C.E. Ruthenberg in 1927. He was editor of &quot;The Communist,&quot; the official theoretical journal of the Communist Party, in 1927 and 1928.

Wolfe was chosen as a delegate of the American Communist Party to the Sixth World Congress of the Comintern in 1928.

In 1928, Wolfe was made the national director of agitation and propaganda for the Workers (Communist) Party of America. He also ran for U.S. Congress as a Communist in the 10th Congressional District of New York.

Late in December 1928, with the election campaign at an end, Wolfe was dispatched by the Lovestone-dominated Central Executive Committee of the American Communist Party to serve as it delegate to the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), where he replaced J. Louis Engdahl. In that capacity, he became involved in the attempt of Jay Lovestone to maintain control of the American organization over the growing opposition of Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov, who ultimately supported the rival faction headed by William Z. Foster and Alexander Bittelman.

According to Benjamin Gitlow&#x27;s 1940 memoir, &quot;I Confess,&quot; Wolfe was directed by the Comintern in April 1929 to be removed from his post in Moscow and to instead accept a dangerous assignment to Korea - at the time under Japanese rule - as part of the campaign against the Lovestone group in the American Communist Party. Wolfe refused the assignment, providing a long statement of his reasons to ECCI for this decision, according to Gitlow.

In June 1929, Wolfe was expelled from the Communist Party, USA for refusing to support the Comintern&#x27;s decisions regarding the American Communist Party, which effectively removed Lovestone from power.

===Communist Party (Opposition)===

Upon returning to the United States, he and Lovestone, who had also been expelled from the party, formed the Communist Party (Opposition) to further their views. Having expected a majority of American Communists to join them, they were disappointed at only being able to attract a few hundred followers. Wolfe became editor of the CP(O)&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Worker&#x27;s Age&quot; and its chief theorist. Initially, Lovestone and Wolfe hoped to eventually be welcomed back into the Communist movement but when changes in the Comintern&#x27;s line failed to result in a rapprochement, the CP(O) moved further and further away from communism. Wolfe and Lovestone were sympathisers of Nikolai Bukharin and helped found the International Communist Opposition (also known as the International Right Opposition) which for a time had some influence before petering out.

In the 1930s, Wolfe and his wife, Ella Goldberg Wolfe, travelled around the world visiting Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Mexico City in 1933 and spending time in Spain prior to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. By 1940, the Wolfes were living in Provincetown, Massachusetts where they befriended Alfred Kazin and introduced him to Mary McCarthy and the writers of the Partisan Review.

The CP(O) meanwhile moved further away from the left and went through several name changes finally becoming the Independent Labor League of America in 1938 before dissolving at the end of 1940 in part because of a break between Lovestone and Wolfe on their interpretation of World War II - with Lovestone favoring American intervention and Wolfe opposing support for what he argued was an imperialist war.

===Cold War===

Wolfe&#x27;s political perspective changed with time, however, and during the Cold War was a leading anti-Communist. In the 1950s, he worked as ideological advisor to the State Department&#x27;s International Broadcasting Office which was in charge of Voice of America. In his autobiography, &quot;A Life in Two Centuries,&quot; Bertram wrote: &quot;When I went to work for the Voice of America in the period from 1950 to 1954, religious leaders and believers were being framed, tortured, and sent to  concentration camps in all the countries under Communist rule in Eastern Europe. After trying to get my script writers to write effective radio broadcasts to defend the religious freedom of the churchmen and devout believers who were being thus persecuted, I found that I had write the scripts myself to get the requisite feeling into them. I did not believe what the persecuted believe , but I did believe in their right to freedom to harbor and practice their beliefs without interference.&quot; He then joined Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace&#x27;s library as senior fellow in Slavic studies and, in 1966, became a senior research fellow at the institution. He also served as a visiting professor at Columbia University and the University of California. In 1973 Wolfe was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.

==Personal life and death==

In 1917, Wolfe married Ella Goldberg (May 10, 1896 – January 8, 2000).

Wolfe died on February 21, 1977, from burns he suffered when his bathrobe caught fire. He was 81 years old at the time of his death.

<doc id="1119663" wikidata="Q5560093" url="?curid=1119663" title="Gifts of healing">
<text>In Christian theology, the gifts of healing are among the spiritual gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12. As an extraordinary charism, gifts of healing are supernatural enablements given to a believer to minister various kinds of healing and restoration to individuals through the power of the Holy Spirit. In the Greek of the New Testament, both the words &quot;gift&quot; and &quot;healing&quot; are plural. 

In the Gospel of Mark&#x27;s account of the Great Commission, Jesus stated that one of the signs to follow believers in him would be healing after the laying on of hands. In the fifth chapter of the Epistle of James, anointing with oil is involved with the laying on of hands and prayer over the sick. These symbolize that believers were channels of divine power and that the healing was the work of the Holy Spirit. Healing is also connected with the forgiveness of sins.

Pentecostal and charismatic Christians believe &quot;that God has made provision that physical healing would be a ministry of His church and that gifts of healings would operate along with faith&quot;. However, they also believe that no minister of healing will heal all that come to them. Faith on the part of the one who prays is essential for healing, but many times faith on the part of one being prayed for is important as well. All Pentecostals and charismatics are encouraged to pray for the healing of the sick even if they do not claim possession of the supernatural gift.

<text>A cuddle party (or a cuddle puddle or snuggle party) is an event designed with the intention of allowing people to experience nonsexual group physical intimacy through cuddling.

== History ==
Reid Mihalko and Marcia Baczynski, a pair of self-described &quot;relationship coaches&quot; in New York City, founded Cuddle Party in New York on February 29, 2004. According to their website, the events were initially created for friends who were too intimidated to attend Mihalko&#x27;s informal massage workshops. Upon publication of the Cuddle Party website, the events were opened to the general public, and, thanks to a swarm of media attention, became a phenomenon in New York.

In order to meet the demand for Cuddle Parties in other cities, Mihalko and Baczynski began a training and certification program in January 2005, and have since trained a number of individuals to facilitate Cuddle Parties in various cities.

<doc id="1119678" wikidata="Q3404447" url="?curid=1119678" title="Aurora Awards">
<text>The Aurora Awards () are a set of primarily literary awards given annually for the best Canadian science fiction or fantasy professional and fan works and achievements from the previous year. The event is organized by Canvention and the awards are given out by the Canadian SF and Fantasy Association and SFSF Boreal Inc. Originally they were known as the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Awards which was shortened to CSFFA and nicknamed the Casper Awards based on that acronym, but this name was changed to the Aurora Awards in 1991, because the Aurora is the same in English and French. The categories have expanded from those focused on literary works to include categories that recognize achievements in comics, music, poetry, art, film and television.

Originally, the CSFFA gave out both the English-language and French-language versions of the awards, with the French-language version known as the Prix Aurora. However, the French-language section of the awards is now known as the Prix Aurora-Boréal and was created through an agreement between SFSFBI and the CSFFA in November 2010, which combined the independent Prix Boréal and the Prix Aurora into a single award affiliated to the English-language award. The awards are selected by member vote, in a similar style to that of the Hugo Awards.

The first award was granted in 1980 at Hal-Con 3, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which was in turn the first convention to be named Canvention, a name which rotates to the convention hosting the awards that year in addition to its regular name.

Voting for the awards is done by members of the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Association, who pay an annual fee of $10. Publishers cannot vote during the nomination or shortlist ballot, but can submit works by authors they represent without paying a fee.

==Award==

The Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Association (CSFFA) and the SFSFBI give out the Aurora and Aurora-Boréal Awards for the best science fiction and fantasy works in each of the categories. CSFFA handle the anglophone Aurora Awards and the SFSFBI handle the francophone Aurora-Boréal Awards, though both organizations co-sponsor the other award. Nominees are only valid if they were produced or completed in the previous calendar year.

For the Aurora Awards, the official nominees are chosen by the awards committee from all of the works that have received at least 5 nominations by CSFFA members throughout the year, and then the shortlist is voted on by every member of the CSFFA. This is obtained through a $10 membership fee, and can be voted in person with a voting card at the annual general meeting of the CSFFA at that year&#x27;s Canvention, or online through a portal set up by the CSFFA. A member must have been a member for at least 1 month before Canvention to be eligible for voting. The deadlines for voting are set by the CSFFA at the previous year&#x27;s Canvention.

For a category to not have an award given for it, usually there has to be less than three eligible nominees in that category before the start of voting, or enough people have voted for the No Award option on the ballot, and this wins a majority.

The voting uses the instant-runoff voting method, where the voters rank their choices and the lowest scorer is eliminated until one nominee has a majority.

For the CSFFA Hall of Fame, the inductee must have been nominated for the trophy, and then selected by a 4-person jury, which is selected by the CSFFA each year.

==Current award categories==

==Recognition==

CSFFA is a federally recognized Canadian non-profit, since 2011.

<doc id="1119679" wikidata="Q5641635" url="?curid=1119679" title="Half a Cow">
<text>Half A Cow is an independent record label from Australia, established in 1990 by Sydney musician and music identity Nic Dalton.

== History ==
In 1985 - 1989 Dalton ran a bookshop (owned by Dalton&#x27;s parents) in the Sydney suburb of Glebe called Dalton&#x27;s Books. In late 1989, Dalton and his friend Miles Ferguson, took over the store, renamed it Half A Cow and started stocking more comics, records and tee-shirts than the &#x27;beat&#x27; books they had been concentrating on. At the same time, they started Half A Cow Records and started working on the label&#x27;s first release, &quot;Billiepeebup&quot; (hac01, released October 1990) - a 4-track recorded album of songs made between 1985 and 1989 by the Love Positions, a duo of Dalton and his then girlfriend, Robyn St Clare from The Hummingbirds. That w&quot;Pleasure&quot; (cow01) by the [1990.

In 1991, Half A Cow released the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Want To Be Grant McLennan&quot; by Smudge (about Go-Betweens co-founder Grant McLennan), which was an indie hit, and single of the week in music magazine NME

In late 1991 Evan Dando asked Dalton to temporarily join The Lemonheads. An offer he initially turned down, but as Dando pointed out that it would make his label known worldwide, and with persuasion from friends he did indeed join, and as expected in 1992 it gave a huge boost for Half a Cow. Before he left Half A Cow assistant, Dave Chatfield, was appointed to run the label, along with Robyn St Clare. In 1992 the label also signed a deal with Festival Records to distribute the label. In 1994 the label switched distributor to Mercury Records, which was followed by a change in 1998 back to Festival Records. In early 2000 Half A Cow ended its relationship with Festival Records and now the label is completely independent and distributed through MGM Distribution. Chatfield moved to Melbourne to pursue touring with Spunk and the label is solely managed by Dalton.

Since its establishment in 1990 Half A Cow has put out over two hundred and fifty releases by a long line of bands and solo acts, including work by Dalton and bands he has been in (such as Sneeze, Godstar, a re-issue of The Plunderers&#x27; &quot;Banana Smoothie, Honey&quot;, and Nic Dalton and his Gloomchasers), who dissolved in November 2019. As of May 2006, the label is based back in Sydney (after six years in NSW&#x27;s central west and a year in Digger&#x27;s Rest, Victoria) where it continues to release contemporary Australian music as well as a series of re-issues by bands from the 1960s (like Pip Proud, The Missing Links, The Purple Hearts and the Wild Cherries). The label took a break from releasing any new recordings between 2012 and 2014 but returned in 2015 with a new album from Bernie Hayes. 2016 saw the reissue of two mid 2000s albums by Perth band The Burton Cool Suit and more recently the label has released new music featuring Dalton&#x27;s collaboration with Adem K from Turnstyle.

==Documentary==
Melbourne filmmaker Jarrad Kennedy is completing a documentary about Nic Dalton, covering his work as a musician and label boss for Half A Cow.

&quot;If It&#x27;s Catchy&quot; will be released in 2016 with Part II to follow in 2018.

<text>John Charles Hagee (born April 12, 1940) is an American pastor and televangelist. He founded John Hagee Ministries, which telecasts to the United States and Canada. He is also the founder and chairman of the Christian Zionist organization Christians United for Israel, the largest Zionist organization in America.

Hagee has attracted controversy over his comments on the Catholic Church, Jewish people and Islam, and promotion of the blood moon prophecy.

== Early life ==
Hagee was born in Baytown, Texas on April 12, 1940. He studied at Southwestern Assemblies of God University in Waxahachie, Texas, and received a Bachelor of Science, and then studied at Trinity University and obtained a second Bachelor of Science. He also studied at the University of North Texas in educational administration and received a master&#x27;s degree in 1966.

Hagee has been married twice. In 1960, he married Martha Downing, and they divorced in 1975. In 1976, he married a member of his congregation, Diana Castro.

He has a son, Matt Hagee, who is also a pastor.

== Career ==

Hagee founded Trinity Church in San Antonio, Texas in 1966. In 1975, Hagee wrote a letter to his congregation that he was guilty of immorality, after which he divorced his wife, Martha Downing. Criticism from the divorce caused Hagee to resign.

Hagee founded The Church at Castle Hills in 1975. The church grew in size and following two expansions, its second sanctuary was named Cornerstone Church. The church has adopted Pentecostal beliefs, including biblical literalism, speaking in tongues, divine healing, the prosperity gospel, and absolute opposition to abortion. Beginning in 1981 in San Antonio, following Operation Opera, Hagee has organized &quot;A Night to Honor Israel&quot; events aiming to show support for the State of Israel.

Hagee has been politically active. In 1968, he endorsed Democrat George Wallace in his bid for president. His advocacy included organizing and mobilizing a youth movement called &quot;Wallace Youth&quot;.

In 1996, Hagee spoke on behalf of Republican presidential primary candidate Alan Keyes, who in 2004 lost the U.S. Senate election in Illinois to Barack Obama. In 2002, Hagee endorsed the conservative State Representative John Shields in the latter&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the Republican primary for the District 25 seat in the Texas Senate. Hagee dubbed Shields&#x27;s opponent, incumbent Jeff Wentworth, &quot;the most pro-abortion&quot; of 181 legislators in both houses of the Texas legislature.

On February 7, 2006, Hagee and some 400 leaders from across the Christian and Jewish communities formed Christians United for Israel (CUFI). This lobbies members of the United States Congress, using a biblical stance for promoting Christian Zionism. Around that time he received death threats for his activism on behalf of the State of Israel and hired bodyguards for protection.

In 2008, Hagee endorsed Senator John McCain in the presidential contest against Barack Obama. After Hagee&#x27;s endorsement of McCain, a furor arose over statements made by Hagee that were perceived by some as anti-Catholic and antisemitic. Following Hagee&#x27;s remarks, McCain publicly distanced himself from Hagee.

Hagee was the primary funding source for the Israeli Zionist group Im Tirtzu, until he cut ties with the organization in 2013. He is also anti-abortion and stopped giving money to Israel&#x27;s Hadassah Medical Center when it began offering the procedure.

In 2016, Hagee endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

In 2023, Hagee endorsed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican Primary.

==Views==
=== LGBT ===
In 2006, he claimed that Hurricane Katrina was God&#x27;s punishment for a planned pride parade.

=== Catholicism ===
Hagee purported that Adolf Hitler&#x27;s antisemitism was especially derived from his Catholic background, and he also purported that Hitler was &quot;a spiritual leader in the Catholic Church,&quot; as well as purporting that the Catholic Church under Pope Pius XII encouraged Nazism. Hagee also blamed the Catholic Church for instigating the Dark Ages, claiming that it allowed the Crusaders to rape and murder with impunity. William Donohue, the president of the Catholic League for Civil and Religious Rights, rejected the comments and Hagee&#x27;s explanations for them. On May 12, 2008, after discussions with Donohue and other Catholic leaders, Hagee issued a letter of apology, expressing regret for &quot;any comments that Catholics have found hurtful.&quot; The apology was accepted by William Donohue.

=== Jewish people ===
Hagee has stated that he believes the Bible commands Christians to support the State of Israel.

Reform Rabbi Eric Yoffie criticized Hagee for being &quot;extremist&quot; on Israeli policy and for disparaging other faiths.

Hagee has claimed that Adolf Hitler was born from a lineage of &quot;accursed, genocidally murderous half-breed Jews&quot;. Citing material from Jewish tradition, he claimed that the persecution of Jews throughout history, implicitly including the Holocaust, was due to the Jewish people&#x27;s disobedience of God.

In 2008, Hagee claimed that the anti-Christ will be &quot;a homosexual&quot; and &quot;partially Jewish, as was Adolf Hitler&quot; and he also claimed that a reference in Jeremiah 16:16 to &quot;fishers&quot; and &quot;hunters&quot; was symbolic of positive motivation (Herzl/Zionism) and negative motivation (Hitler/Nazism) respectively, both men were sent by God for the purpose of having Jews return to Israel, and he suggested that the Holocaust was willed by God because most Jews &quot;ignored&quot; Herzl.

=== Islam ===
Hagee has made demonizing comments about Islam. Hagee has claimed that &quot;Islam not only condones violence; it commands it&quot;. He has also claimed that a contrast exists between Islam&#x27;s &quot;violent nature&quot; and Christianity&#x27;s &quot;loving nature&quot; and that the Quran teaches, and Muslims have a mandate, to kill Jews and Christians.

=== Blood moon prophecy ===
Hagee, along with Mark Biltz, made the blood moon prophecy, which they promoted in a 2013 book. The two men claimed that a tetrad which began with the April 2014 lunar eclipse was a sign of the end times as described in the Bible and the tetrad ended with the lunar eclipse on September 27–28, 2015. The prediction was criticized by scientists.

===Global warming===
In 2007, Hagee stated that he does not believe in global warming, contradicting the scientific consensus on climate change, and he also said that he sees the Kyoto Protocol as a &quot;conspiracy&quot; aimed at manipulating the U.S. economy.

<text>Head On is the fifth studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, released in December 1975. On the original vinyl release, the outer album cover expanded into a 24x24 inch poster featuring all four members of the band at that time. It was re-released in 2003 on Repertoire Records in conjunction with Mercury Records. The re-release featured the bonus track &quot;Down to the Line&quot;, which was released as a single in 1975 but not included on the vinyl nor the original Mercury CD release of &quot;Head On&quot;.

The single &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot; reached #33 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts and received significant airplay at that time. It was the last of the band&#x27;s six U.S Top 40 singles. Pioneering rocker Little Richard played piano on the recording. Near the end of the song, C.F. Turner tells him to &quot;play it Richard&quot;, and he does, with heavy expression. Another single from this album, the jazzy &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out for #1&quot;, did not crack the Top 40 on the U.S. pop charts, but reached #15 on the Adult Contemporary chart, receiving heavy airplay upon its release on both conventional rock and soft rock stations.

&quot;Away from Home&quot; was also released as a single in the UK only, with &quot;Down To The Line&quot; on the B-side. It did not chart.

==Commercial performance==
By February 1976, &quot;Head On&quot; had sold 900,000 copies in the US. It was a top five album in Canada, hitting the #3 position on February 21, 1976. It was the last non-compilation BTO album to reach the Top 40 on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, hitting the #23 position on March 6, 1976.

<text>The vocal sac is the flexible membrane of skin possessed by most male frogs and toads. The purpose of the vocal sac is usually as an amplification of their mating or advertisement call. The presence or development of the vocal sac is one way of externally determining the sex of a frog or toad in many species; taking frogs as an example;

The vocal sac is open to the mouth cavity of the frog, with two slits on either side of the tongue. To call, the frog inflates its lungs and shuts its nose and mouth. Air is then expelled from the lungs, through the larynx, and into the vocal sac. The vibrations of the larynx emits a sound, which resonates on the elastic membrane of the vocal sac. The resonance causes the sound to be amplified and allows the call to carry further. Muscles within the body wall force the air back and forth between the lungs and vocal sac.

==Development==
The development of the vocal sac is different in most species, however they mostly follow the same process. The development of the unilobular vocal sac begins with two small growths on the floor of the mouth. These grow until they form two small pouches, which expand until they meet in the centre of the mouth and form one large cavity, which then grows until it is fully developed.

==Purpose==
The primary purpose of the vocal sac is to amplify the advertisement call of the male, and attract females from as large an area as possible. Species of frog without vocal sacs may only be heard within a radius of a few metres, whereas some species with vocal sacs can be heard over away. Modern frog species (neobatrachians and some mesobatrachians) which lack vocal sacs tend to inhabit areas close to flowing water. The sound of the flowing water overpowers the advertisement call, so they must advertise by other means.

An alternative use of the vocal sac is employed by the frogs of the family Rhinodermatidae. The males of the two species of this family scoop recently hatched tadpoles into their mouth, where they move into the vocal sac. The tadpoles of Darwin&#x27;s frog (&quot;Rhinoderma darwinii&quot;) remain in the vocal sac until metamorphosis, whereas the Chile Darwin&#x27;s frog (&quot;Rhinoderma rufum&quot;) will transport the tadpoles to a water source.
