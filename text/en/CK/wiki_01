<text>&quot;The Trooper&quot; is a song by the English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released as the second single on 20 June 1983 from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; (1983). It was one of only a few Iron Maiden songs to achieve frequent radio airplay in the United States, peaking at No. 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock. 

The song achieved success in the United Kingdom, reaching No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart—a better reception than the band&#x27;s previous single, &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot;. It is one of their most popular and remains an essential track of heavy metal music. A live version of the song, from album &quot;Death on the Road&quot;, was issued in 2005.

==Overview==
Written by bassist and founding member Steve Harris, the song is based on the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava 1854, which took place during the Crimean War, and inspired by Lord Tennyson&#x27;s 1854 poem of the same name. The track has been the subject of significant praise since its release, with AllMusic describing it as &quot;an all-time genre classic that boasts guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith&#x27;s most memorable harmonized lead riff, plus that trademark galloping rhythm&quot;, while Mick Wall comments that it is the song &quot;which most Maiden fans from those days still recall first when you mention the &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; album&quot;. Despite the popularity of the song, it was the single&#x27;s B-side, a cover of Jethro Tull&#x27;s &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot;, which managed to gain a substantial amount of airplay on US radio, becoming one of the band&#x27;s few tracks, along with previous single &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot;, to do so.
The single&#x27;s accompanying music video, filmed in Brixton Academy and directed by Jim Yukich, included clips of a cavalry battle from the 1936 film &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, which the BBC refused to play unedited, deeming the footage too violent. The band&#x27;s manager, Rod Smallwood, has since criticized the decision, stating, &quot;Anyone would think we&#x27;d killed the horses ourselves instead of using an old Errol Flynn movie&quot;. In 2003, Iron Maiden released a Camp Chaos version for the song. The music video shows the never-before-seen clips of the band playing the song (although it was rarely featured in the Australian TV show &quot;Rage&quot;). as well as the animated battle between Eddie and politicians Al Gore and George W. Bush to which Eddie ended the conflict in the video by killing both Bush, Gore and their team. The updated version came in 2008, this time, the two US politicians were replaced by Eddie&#x27;s yellow skeleton allies and their red enemy skeletons.

A regular fixture in the band&#x27;s concerts, vocalist Bruce Dickinson has always waved a Union Flag during live performances and, more recently, has begun wearing an authentic red coat uniform which would have been worn during the battle on which the song was based. During a performance in Dublin in 2003, Dickinson&#x27;s flag-waving reportedly received a large amount of booing from the Irish audience.

While the band were receiving criticism from Sharon Osbourne in 2005, at the time justifying her attack on the band at the 2005 Ozzfest, she accused Iron Maiden of disrespecting American troops, then fighting alongside the British in Iraq, for waving a Union Flag in the US, although &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine supported the band by pointing out that the song&#x27;s subject bore no relation to the military activity then taking place in the Middle East.

On 15 August 2005, a live version of the song was released from the then upcoming live album, &quot;Death on the Road&quot;.

On 24 April 2016, during Iron Maiden&#x27;s performance in Beijing (their first in China), Dickinson did not bring out a flag while performing &quot;The Trooper&quot; as part of the request from the Chinese government to allow Iron Maiden to perform in the country. The flag was also omitted for a concert in Shanghai two days later.

==In popular culture==
The song has appeared in several Iron Maiden tribute albums, including &quot;A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;, &quot;Numbers from the Beast&quot;, &quot;A Tribute to the Beast&quot; and &quot;Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;, as well as on records by tribute bands such as Maiden uniteD (on 2010&#x27;s &quot;Mind the Acoustic Pieces&quot;) and The Iron Maidens (on their 2006 self-titled debut album). In addition, the song has been released by Sentenced on &quot;The Trooper&quot; EP (1994), Rage on &quot;End of All Days&quot; (1996), Hellsongs on &quot;Hymns in the Key of 666&quot; (2008), Thumper on the &quot;Metalliska&quot; compilation, Highland Glory as a bonus track on &quot;Forever Endeavour&quot; (2005), Radio Cult on &quot;Grooves from the Grave&quot; (2008), Stryper on &quot;The Covering&quot;, Iced Earth on the &quot;tour edition&quot; of their 2011 album, &quot;Dystopia&quot;, 2Cellos on their 2015 album, &quot;Celloverse&quot;, and Esprit D&#x27;Air releasing a cover with Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens and Ben Christo (The Sisters of Mercy).

On top of this, the track has also been included in the &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot;, &quot;Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; video games, is mentioned in the novel &quot;World War Z&quot; by Max Brooks and is used as the opening theme for the documentary series &quot;Metal Evolution&quot;.

Iron Maiden created a beer called &quot;Trooper&quot;, named after the song.

===Northern Ireland===
During the course of the Troubles in Northern Ireland the image of Eddie, as he appears on the sleeve of &quot;The Trooper&quot;, became an unofficial mascot of the Ulster Freedom Fighters loyalist paramilitary group and was the main figure on a number of the group&#x27;s murals. The loyalist representation frequently carried a tattered flag with the emblem of the Ulster Defence Association rather than the Union Flag as on the Iron Maiden sleeve.

<doc id="1116636" wikidata="Q1384513" url="?curid=1116636" title="John White (Kentucky politician)">
<text>John D. White (February 14, 1802 – September 22, 1845) was an American lawyer and politician who was the 15th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1841 to 1843. A member of the Whig Party, he represented Kentucky in the United States House of Representatives from 1835 to 1845. He was also a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1832.

Born near Middlesboro, Kentucky, a small rural mountain town located in the Eastern Kentucky Coalfield, John was a member of the prestigious White family of politicians of Kentucky and Tennessee. He received a common education and studied law at Greeneville College in Tusculum, Tennessee. After graduating, White was an apprentice under William Owsley, another successful politician and lawyer. White was then admitted to the bar and quickly built a reputation as an adept lawyer.

Within several years, White was leading the Kentucky bar. Using his powerful and convincing speaking skills, he progressed to become one of the local leaders of the Whig Party and won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives. In 1835, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Kentucky&#x27;s 9th congressional district, and was continuously re-elected until his retirement in 1845. With the help of Henry Clay, he was chosen as speaker of the house, one of the highest political positions in the United States. He served as speaker for one term, but due to ineffective governing by his colleagues, he lost re-election as speaker. He served another term as a member of the House before he was appointed judge of the 19th judicial district in Kentucky. During the last few months of his life, he suffered from ill mental health, which eventually led to his death by suicide in September 1845.

== Early life, family, and education ==
John D. White was born on February 14, 1802, near Cumberland Gap (now Middlesboro, Kentucky), to Hugh and Catherine White. His father was the owner of Goose Creek Salt Works, which made the White family particularly wealthy and influential in Kentucky. He was kin to many influential politicians, including Addison White, John Daugherty White, and Hugh Lawson White, all of whom served in the U.S. Congress. He was educated in the common schools and studied law at Greeneville College (now known as Tusculum University) in Tusculum, Tennessee. He was also a student, friend, and fervent admirer of Henry Clay.

== Career ==
White studied law under William Owsley, who served as governor of Kentucky from 1844 to 1848. White was admitted to the bar in 1823 and quickly earned notoriety as a skilled lawyer, earning a substantial number of clients. Within several years, White had climbed to head of the bar in Kentucky.

=== Early political career (1832–1841) ===
White was known as a powerful orator and a convincing speaker. He soon rose to become one of the local leaders of the Whig Party and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1832. In 1835, he was elected a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Kentucky&#x27;s 9th congressional district. During his time as a U.S. representative, White played an important role in discussions, particularly those regarding tariffs.

White served during the last several years of the Andrew Jackson administration. He opposed Jackson&#x27;s fight against the Second Bank, believing it was mainly for personal reasons. He continued to serve during the Martin Van Buren administration and opposed the sub-treasury act, as well as the plan to annex Texas.

=== Speaker of the House (1841–1843) ===
In 1841, Whigs won a majority in the House and White was nominated for speaker. Henry Clay (a friend and supporter of White) helped in uniting House Whigs behind White, as well as building on supporters in both Kentucky and New England. Clay nominated Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith for clerk, believing that a pairing of White and Smith would secure the inter-regional alliance Clay was working to build. Many house Whigs saw Clay&#x27;s scheme as alienating, which led to the conference being disbanded &quot;in high dudgeon&quot;. White&#x27;s challenger for the speakership was Democrat John Winston Jones. Many southern Whigs were dissatisfied with White, believing he was too moderate on the issue of slavery, and many threatened to nominate their own candidate for speaker, although they later just ended up casting their vote for White. When the house assembled, White captured a victory over Jones, receiving 121 votes out of 221 votes cast. He presided over the 27th United States Congress from May 31, 1841, to March 4, 1843.

After his election as speaker, White began re-constructing the standing house committees, giving Democrats the chairs of just five committees, and giving the rest to the Whigs. The Whig-controlled Congress took swift action in repealing the Independent Treasury Act and implemented a new Bankruptcy Act. Most of the legislation passed by the Whigs was vetoed by President John Tyler.

In the 1842–43 elections, the Whigs had lost almost half of the seats they gained during the 1840–41 elections, one of the largest losses a controlling party had suffered in American history. Historians attribute this loss to ineffective governing, difficulties with president Tyler, and reapportionment. With Tyler as president, the Whigs&#x27; economic plan was thwarted. As a result, the Whigs fished for policy alternatives, which, according to professors Jeffery A. Jenkins and Charles Stewart III, made the Whigs look incompetent. White was the Whigs&#x27; choice for speaker. The Democrats again nominated John Winston Jones to challenge White, and with the result of the recent elections, the Democrats gained a majority in the house. Jones defeated White by a margin of 128–59.

In his diary, former president John Quincy Adams wrote that &quot;White is man of fine talents and an able debater, but his manner is so vehement and his articulation so rapid that it becomes altogether indistinct. He repeats the word &#x27;sir&#x27; every fifth word, and his discourse is one continued stream, without division into paragraphs or construction of sentences.&quot;

=== Post–speakership (1843–1845) ===
On April 23, 1844, the House held a debate discussing the accusations of corruption that had been made against Henry Clay, the Whig Party&#x27;s nominee for president that year. White, a staunch supporter of Clay, delivered a speech defending Clay. George O. Rathbun, a Democratic congressman from New York and opponent of Clay, began an argument with White. The argument soon escalated to a fistfight between the two congressmen, as other members of the house rushed to try and break up the fight. During the fight, an unknown person fired a pistol into the crowd, wounding a police officer. The House subsequently attempted to cover up the behavior. Both White and Rathbun apologized for their actions.

On February 8, 1845, White was appointed judge of the nineteenth judicial district of Kentucky. His nomination was approved by the Kentucky Senate by a margin of 22–11, and in a second vote his nomination was approved by a margin of 26–9. He decided not to run for re-election as a U.S. representative, instead deciding to take on full duties as a judge. He held the role of judge until his death by suicide on September 22, 1845.

== Later life and death ==
Before he took up the role of judge, White plagiarized a speech from former vice president Aaron Burr. When it was discovered, the press began ridiculing White. His embarrassment, combined with a bout of ill health and depression, led to White shooting himself in the head with a pistol. White is buried in the Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Whitesburg, Kentucky is named in his honor.

<doc id="1116639" wikidata="Q2600735" url="?curid=1116639" title="Wea">
<text>The Wea were a Miami–Illinois-speaking Native American tribe originally located in western Indiana. Historically, they were described as being either closely related to the Miami tribe or a sub-tribe of Miami. 

Today, the descendants of the Wea, along with the Kaskaskia, Piankeshaw, and Peoria, are enrolled in the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, a federally recognized tribe in Oklahoma.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Wea&quot; is used today as the a shortened version of their numerous recorded names. The Wea name for themselves (autonym) in their own language is &quot;waayaahtanwa&quot;, derived from &quot;waayaahtanonki&quot;, &#x27;place of the whirlpool&#x27;, where they were first recorded being seen and where they were living at that time.

The many different spellings of the tribe&#x27;s name include Waiatanwa, Ouaouiatanoukak, Aoiatenon, Aouciatenons, Ochiatenens, Ouatanons, Ouias, Ouiatanon, Wah-we-ah-tung-ong, Warraghtinooks, and Wyatanons.

== Language == 
The Wea spoke a dialect of Miami–Illinois language, part of the Algonquian language family.

== History ==

The Wea lived north of the Ohio River in parts of western Indiana and southeastern Illinois. The first written mention of the tribe is from 1673. French explorers wrote about them in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Another Miami sub-tribe, the Pepikokia were a separate tribe until 1742 but then later became part of the Wea tribe. In the 18th century, the Wea, Miami, and Piankashaw remained distinct tribes. The Wea population of 1765 is estimated to have been around 1,200.

In the early 18th century, Wea people settled in villages along the Wabash River between what would become Terre Haute and Logansport, Indiana. They established a large settlement called Ouiatenon, near what is now Lafayette, and the French colonists established Fort Ouiatenon, which facilitated trade with the Wea and Kickapoo.

In 1747, British colonists began trading with a band of Miami living on the Great Miami River in Ohio. Weas began trading with them as well, until the French destroyed their trading post. By 1763, the Wea joined Odawa war chief Pontiac in Pontiac&#x27;s War against the British. The Wea first were neutral during the American Revolution but later joined the Miami in fighting with the British. The Wea were forced to move to Missouri and Arkansas in 1820. They were later forced into Kansas and finally Indian Territory, which became Oklahoma.

With increased Euro-American settlement and the United States&#x27;s policy of Indian removal, the US federal government made many treaties with these tribes.

In 1854, the Wea signed a treaty that merged them politically with other remnant tribes of the Illinois Confederacy to become the Confederated Peoria Tribe. The Miami people also joined the Confederated Peoria Tribe in 1873.

==Former village sites==

Some mentions of Wea people in treaties include the following:
Treaty of St. Marys 1820 in Article 3: 
&quot;As it is contemplated by the said Tribe, to remove from the Wabash, it is agreed, that the annuity secured to the Weas, by the Treaty of Saint Mary&#x27;s, above mentioned, shall hereafter be paid to them at Kaskaskia in the state of Illinois.&quot;

Treaty of Castor Hill 1832 in Article 4:
&quot;The United States will also afford some assistance to that part of the Wea tribe now residing in the State of Indiana, to enable them to join the rest of their tribe on the lands hereby assigned them...&quot;

<doc id="1116644" wikidata="Q1137403" url="?curid=1116644" title="Yue (state)">
<text>Yue (), also known as Yuyue ( or ), was a state in ancient China which existed during the first millennium BC the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods of China&#x27;s Zhou dynasty in the modern provinces of Zhejiang, Shanghai and Jiangsu. Its original capital was Kuaiji (modern Shaoxing); after its conquest of Wu, Yue relocated its court north to the city of Wu (modern-day Suzhou). Yue was conquered by Chu in 333 BC.

==History==

A specific kingdom, which had been known as the &quot;Yue Guo&quot; () in modern Zhejiang, was not mentioned until it began a series of wars against its northern neighbor Wu during the late 6th century BC. According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and &quot;Discourses of the States&quot;, the Yue are descended from Wuyu, the son of Shao Kang, the sixth king of the Xia dynasty.

With help from Wu&#x27;s enemy Chu, Yue won after several decades of conflict. The famous Yue King Goujian destroyed and annexed Wu in 473 BC. During the reign of Wuqiang (), six generations after Goujian, Yue was partitioned by Chu and Qi in 333 BC.

During its existence, Yue was famous for the quality of its metalworking, particularly its swords. Examples include the extremely well-preserved Swords of Goujian and Zhougou.

The Yue state appears to have been a largely indigenous political development in the lower Yangtze. This region corresponds with that of the old corded-ware Neolithic, and it continued to be one that shared a number of practices, such as tooth extraction, pile building, and cliff burial. Austronesian speakers also still lived in the region down to its conquest and sinification beginning about 240 BC.

What set the Yue apart from other Sinitic states of the time was their possession of a navy. Yue culture was distinct in its practice of naming boats and swords. A Chinese text described the Yue as a people who used boats as their carriages and oars as their horses.

==Rulers of Yue family tree==
Their ancestral name is rendered variously as either Si () or Luo ( or ).

==Aftermath==
After the fall of Yue, the ruling family moved south to what is now northern Fujian and set up the Minyue kingdom. This successor state lasted until around 150 BC, when it miscalculated an alliance with the Han dynasty.

Mingdi, Wujiang&#x27;s second son, was appointed minister of Wucheng (present-day Huzhou&#x27;s Wuxing District) by the king of Chu. He was titled Marquis of Ouyang Ting, from a pavilion on the south side of Ouyu Mountain. The first Qin dynasty emperor Qin Shi Huang abolished the title after his conquest of Chu in 223 BC, but descendants and subjects of its former rulers took up the surnames Ou, Ouyang, and Ouhou () in remembrance.

When the religious leader Xu Chang launched a rebellion against the Han dynasty in 172 CE, he declared the state of Yue restored and appointed his father Xu Sheng as &quot;King of Yue&quot;. The rebels were crushed in 174.

==Astronomy==
In Chinese astronomy, there are two stars named for Yue:

*Yue (along with Wu) is represented by the star Zeta Aquilae in the &quot;Left Wall&quot; of the Heavenly Market enclosure
*Yue is also represented by the star Psi Capricorni or 19 Capricorni in the &quot;Twelve States&quot; of the mansion of the Girl.

==Biology==
The virus genus &quot;Yuyuevirus&quot; and the virus family &quot;Yueviridae&quot; are both named after the state.

==People from Yue==
*Yuenü, swordswoman &amp; author of the earliest-known exposition on swordplay
*Xi Shi, a famous beauty of the ancient Yue Guo.

==Language==

Possible languages spoken in the state of Yue may have been of Tai-Kadai and Austronesian origins. 126 Tai-Kadai cognates have been identified in Maqiao Wu dialect spoken in the suburbs of Shanghai out of more than a thousand lexical items surveyed. According to the author, these cognates are likely traces of &#x27;old Yue language&#x27; ().

<doc id="1116649" wikidata="Q7304047" url="?curid=1116649" title="Red Dog (novel)">
<text>Red Dog (2002) is a short novel by Louis de Bernières charting the life of a popular dog, a &quot;Red Cloud Kelpie&quot; nicknamed Red Dog, in Dampier, Western Australia. A movie based on the novel was filmed in Australia in 2011.

==Part One==
Red Dog covers the life span of a Red Cloud Kelpie, originally named Tally Ho. He is said to have &quot;hitched rides, adopted people and united communities throughout Western Australia&#x27;s mining region.&quot; His owners are Jack and Maureen Collins. At a barbecue, Tally Ho doesn&#x27;t return to the owners after they leave, and he starts traveling.

Red Dog meets John, a half Māori man, at the Hamersley Iron Transport section after a salt company has moved in. Red Dog is very attached to John and they spend a lot of time together. As the town grows, more people come and befriend Red Dog. Nancy and Patsy come into the story. When Nancy notices that Red Dog has been shot, she calls John and his friend. They stop work in order to treat Red Dog and prevent his bleeding to death. Red Dog undergoes an operation. Ellen is introduced. John has an accident and dies, after crashing his motorcycle and getting his chest caved in on a rock.

==Part Two==
Red Dog doesn&#x27;t realize John has died so he goes out and looks for him. He meets Nancy on a bus, and then they have ice cream. He spends time in a caravan park with Nancy and meets Red Cat. They eventually befriend each other despite their differences. Red Dog is suspected of having Heartworm and has treatment for it. Red Dog returns to the caravan park, where he is noticed by the caretakers. The Cribbages are portrayed as bad people, with Mr. Cribbage described as having a Hitler-like mustache. They decide to throw Nancy out because she has let Red Dog stay despite the park&#x27;s having a &quot;no dogs&quot; policy.

When other locals learn that the Cribbages are trying to get rid of the popular dog, they threaten the couple until they leave. Red Dog is poisoned with strychnine and has to be put down. Bill and Piotr (Peeto) find him and don&#x27;t want him to suffer, but in the end they cannot shoot him. They take him to the vet who had treated him before. He gives the dog a painkiller and eases his death. The locals hold a funeral for Red Dog and a monument for him is built in Dampier, Western Australia.

<doc id="1116654" wikidata="Q354824" url="?curid=1116654" title="Steven Truscott">
<text>Steven Murray Truscott (born January 18, 1945) is a Canadian man who, at age fourteen, was convicted and sentenced to death in 1959 for the rape and murder of classmate Lynne Harper. Truscott had been the last known person to see her alive. He was scheduled to be hanged; however, the federal cabinet reprieved him and he was sentenced to life in prison and released on parole in 1969. Five decades later, in 2007, his conviction was overturned on the basis that key forensic evidence was weaker than had been portrayed at trial, and key evidence in favor of Truscott was concealed from his defense team. He was the youngest person in Canada to face execution.

==Lynne Harper== 
Cheryl Lynne Harper was born to Leslie and Shirley Harper on August 31, 1946, in New Brunswick. She had one older brother, Barry Harper, who lived in Ohio, and a younger brother, Jeffrey. Her father was a school teacher before he joined the military in 1940. They relocated to the RCAF base at Clinton in July, 1957. Lynne spent time going to Sunday school, Bible class and Girl Guides.

On June 9, 1959, Lynne—then 12 years of age—disappeared near RCAF Station Clinton, an air force base south of Clinton, Ontario in what is now Vanastra (roughly 80 kilometers north of London). Two days later, on the afternoon of June 11, searchers discovered her body in a nearby farm woodlot. Harper had been raped and had been strangled with her own blouse.

Steven Truscott and Harper had been classmates in a combined grades 7/8 class at the Air Vice Marshal Hugh Campbell School located on the north side of the Air Force base. In the early evening of Tuesday, June 9, 1959, Truscott had given Harper a ride on the crossbar of his bicycle and proceeded from the vicinity of the school northwards along the County Road. The timing and duration of their encounter, and what happened while they were together, have been contentious issues since 1959.

In court, the Crown contended that Truscott and Harper left the County Road before reaching the bridge over the Bayfield River and, in a wooded area beside the County Road (known as Lawson&#x27;s Bush), Truscott raped and murdered Lynne. Truscott has maintained since 1959 that he took Harper to the intersection of the County Road and Highway 8, where he left her unharmed. Truscott maintains that when he arrived at the bridge, he looked back toward the intersection where he had dropped Harper off and observed that a vehicle had stopped and that she was in the process of entering it. On June 10, 1959 at 9:30 a.m. Steven was interviewed by (Constable) Hobbs in a cruiser at his school. He told Hobbs that while standing on the bridge, he saw Lynne get into a &quot;late model Chevrolet&quot; and there &quot;was a lot of chrome on the car and it could have been a Bellair [&quot;sic&quot;] version.&quot; At 11:20 that evening, Lynne&#x27;s father reported her missing. Truscott would later in his life after serving a multitude of years in prison (after his sentence was changed from the death penalty to life in prison) attempt to disprove his involvement in the rape and murder of Lynne. 3 entomology studies were conducted at the sit of Lynne&#x27;s murder to prove the innocence of Truscott through the presence of maggots identified as Bluebottle flies and Flesh flies. That of which determined she would have been dead the morning of June 10th rather than before sunset of the evening of the day before which was submitted in the final autopsy report. Many descripencies were found in the original autopsy reports including 2 draft reports that showed drastically different results than the one that was submitted to The Crown. Truscott has now be cleared and was provided $6.5 million dollars in reperation. 

==Arrest and trial==
On June 12, shortly after 7:00 p.m., Truscott was taken into custody. At about 2:30 a.m. on June 13, he was charged with first-degree murder under the provisions of the &quot;Juvenile Delinquents Act&quot;. On June 30, Truscott was ordered to be tried as an adult; an appeal on that order was dismissed.

On September 16, Truscott&#x27;s trial began in the then Supreme Court of Ontario in Goderich before Mr. Justice Ferguson and a jury. Steven Truscott was represented by Frank Donnelly; Glen Hays appeared for the Crown. All the evidence presented in court against the accused was circumstantial, and centred on placing Harper&#x27;s death within a narrow time frame which implicated Truscott. Key to this narrow window was the autopsy doctor&#x27;s testimony that the decomposition of Lynne&#x27;s body and the state of partially digested food in her stomach indicated she had died near the precise time she was acknowledged to have been with Truscott. On September 30, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation for mercy. Justice Ferguson then sentenced Truscott to death by hanging.

On January 21, 1960, Truscott&#x27;s appeal, put forth by John G. J. O&#x27;Driscoll to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed. Immediately afterwards the Government of Canada commuted Truscott&#x27;s sentence to life imprisonment. An application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied on February 24. On that date, Truscott did not have an automatic right to appeal to this court.

==Incarceration and parole==
From his arrest until the commutation of his death sentence, Truscott was imprisoned at the Huron County Gaol in Goderich.

After the commutation of his sentence he was transferred to the Kingston Penitentiary for assessment and he was incarcerated at the Ontario Training School for Boys in Guelph from February 1960 to January 1963. On January 14, 1963, he was transferred to Collins Bay Penitentiary.

Truscott was transferred on May 7, 1967 to the Farm Annex of Collins Bay Penitentiary. On October 21, 1969, Truscott was released on parole and lived in Kingston with his parole officer and then in Vancouver for a brief period before settling in Guelph under an assumed name. He married and raised three children.

On November 12, 1974, Truscott was relieved of the terms and conditions of his parole by the National Parole Board.

==At the Supreme Court: the 1960s==
Truscott&#x27;s case was the focus of considerable public attention. In early 1966, Isabel LeBourdais argued in &quot;The Trial of Steven Truscott&quot; that Truscott had been convicted of a crime he did not commit, rekindling public debate and interest in the case. On April 26, 1966, the Government of Canada referred the Truscott case to the Supreme Court of Canada. Five days of evidence were heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in October 1966, followed by submissions in January 1967. That evidence included the testimony of Truscott, who had not testified at the 1959 trial. British pathologist Professor Keith Simpson was invited by the Canadian government to review the forensic evidence.

On May 4, 1967, the Supreme Court (Hall J. dissenting) held that, if Truscott&#x27;s appeal had been heard by the court, it would have been dismissed.

New forensic evidence was presented on his behalf, and Truscott testified before the Supreme Court of Canada, telling his story for the first time. Truscott and 25 other witnesses testified before the Court. After a two-week hearing before the Supreme Court, Canada’s top judges ruled 8-1 against Truscott getting a new trial, and he was returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. The Supreme Court stated that “There were many incredibilities inherent in the evidence given by Truscott before us and we do not believe his testimony.”

The joint opinion of Canada’s Supreme Court Justices was: 
“The verdict of the jury, read in the light of the charge of the trial judge, makes it clear that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts, which they found to be established by the evidence which they accepted, were not only consistent with the guilt of Truscott but were inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that Steven Truscott was the guilty person.” 

== At the Ontario Court of Appeal: 2001–2007 ==

Truscott maintained a low profile until 2000, when an interview on CBC Television&#x27;s investigative news program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; revived interest in his case. Together with a subsequent book by journalist Julian Sher, they suggested that evidence in favour of Truscott&#x27;s innocence had been ignored in the original trial. The documentary suggested that Harper&#x27;s real killer may have been Alexander Kalichuk, a Royal Canadian Air Force Sergeant who had a history of sexual offences and was suspected of two additional murders, and who had died in 1975.

On November 28, 2001, James Lockyer led the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted to file an appeal to have the case reopened. On January 24, 2002, retired Quebec Justice Fred Kaufman was appointed by the federal government to review the case. On October 28, 2004, Justice Minister Irwin Cotler directed a Reference pursuant to section 696.3(a)(ii) of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; to the Court of Appeal for Ontario to review whether new evidence would have changed the 1959 verdict.

On April 6, 2006, the body of Lynne Harper was exhumed by order of the Attorney General of Ontario, in order to test for DNA evidence. There was hope that this would bring some closure to the case, but no usable DNA was recovered from the remains.

Blow flies, maggots and insect activity on Harper&#x27;s body were capable of raising a &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; whether she died before 8 p.m. – and could suggest she died as late as the next day, although the court said there was no realistic possibility that entomology could have assisted in solving the murder in 1959. However, samples of insects and maggots were collected from the body at the time, and the science has since evolved. By knowing when insects deposit their eggs or larvae on a corpse, experts can estimate time of death. The evidence did not rule out that Lynne died at the time stated by the Crown.

Truscott&#x27;s conviction was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario on June 19, 2006. The five-judge panel, headed by Ontario Chief Justice Roy McMurtry and including Justice Michael Moldaver, heard three weeks of testimony and fresh evidence. On January 31, 2007, the Court of Appeal for Ontario began hearing arguments from Truscott&#x27;s defence in the appeal of Truscott&#x27;s conviction. Arguments were heard by the court over a period of ten days, concluding February 10. In addition to the notoriety of the case itself, the hearing is also notable for being the first time that cameras were allowed into a hearing of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.

The Court of Appeal heard evidence, including earlier versions of draft autopsy reports, that contradicted the supposed narrow window for Harper&#x27;s time of death. Pathologist Dr. John Penistan had in fact provided three different estimates for this time period, the first two of which would have excluded Truscott as a suspect. Only after the police had narrowed on Truscott as the prime suspect did Penistan provide &quot;forensic proof&quot; that Harper had died exactly around the time that implicated Truscott. His original estimates and draft autopsy reports were concealed from the defence and the court.

In addition, an elderly couple had told investigators soon after the murder that they had spotted a young girl hitchhiking at the time and place where Truscott stated he had left Harper. Bob Lawson, the farmer who owns the property including Lawson’s Bush, testified during the appeal he and a neighbor saw a strange car parked near his fence, apparently with a man and a girl inside, the night the 12-year-old disappeared, and had reported it to the RCAF guardhouse.

During the review Justice Moldaver asked retired OPP officer Harry &quot;Hank&quot; Sayeau (who assisted Inspector Harold Graham) why the police never considered a sexual psychopath might be responsible for Harper&#x27;s rape and murder before they narrowed their focus on a fourteen-year-old: &quot;Did the thought ever cross your mind that, for someone to strangle her then sexually assault her, you might want to be looking for someone who is more of a pervert, more of a sexual psychopath?&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t recall that&quot;, said the eighty-four-year-old Harry Sayeau.

On August 28, 2007, the Court of Appeal acquitted Truscott of the charges. Truscott&#x27;s defence team had originally asked for a declaration of factual innocence, which would mean that Truscott would be declared innocent, and not merely unable to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Although they issued the acquittal, the court said it was not in a position to declare Truscott innocent of the crime. &quot;The appellant has not demonstrated his factual innocence,&quot; the court wrote. &quot;At this time, and on the totality of the record, we are in no position to make a declaration of innocence.&quot; Within the Court&#x27;s 2006 judgement, as they reviewed the evidence against Truscott, the Court wrote that &quot;In these circumstances, we cannot say that an acquittal is the only reasonable verdict.&quot;

Attorney General of Ontario Michael Bryant apologized to Truscott on behalf of the provincial government, stating they were &quot;truly sorry&quot; for the miscarriage of justice.

Many, including Harper&#x27;s family, have never thought that Truscott was innocent of the murder, and in July 2008 Harper&#x27;s brother described Truscott&#x27;s compensation package as &quot;a real travesty&quot; and indicated he would not inform their father for fear the news would upset him.

==Cultural aspects==
The 1975 film, directed by Murray Markowitz, called &quot;Recommendation for Mercy&quot;, was based fully on the Truscott case, though different names were introduced into the plot. Andrew Skidd starred.

The plot of Ann-Marie MacDonald&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The Way the Crow Flies&quot; is based on a fictionalized version of the Truscott case, and the surrounding community&#x27;s reaction to the incident. MacDonald herself was raised in the same region, during the same time period as the Truscott case.

In protest of the harsh sentence, notable Canadian writer Pierre Berton wrote a poem, &quot;Requiem for a Fourteen-Year-Old&quot;.

Canadian rock band Blue Rodeo recorded a song, &quot;Truscott&quot;, which referenced the case, on their 2000 album &quot;The Days in Between&quot;.

Laurier LaPierre, co-host of a CBC news show, &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot;, was fired after shedding a tear in response to an interview with Truscott&#x27;s mother, Doris. LaPierre&#x27;s reaction – quickly wiping away tears under one eye and speaking in a shaky voice – infuriated CBC president Alphonse Ouimet. The president, already a critic of &quot;Seven Days&quot;, took it as proof that LaPierre was &quot;unprofessional&quot;. The popular show was cancelled, and the other co-host, Patrick Watson, was also fired over the incident.

The case was dramatized in a 1993 episode of the CBC drama anthology series &quot;Scales of Justice&quot;, with Zachary Ansley playing Truscott in reenactments of both Truscott&#x27;s original trial and his first Supreme Court appeal.

A play called &quot;Innocence Lost&quot;, written by Beverley Cooper and based on Truscott&#x27;s conviction, was featured at the Blyth Festival Theatre in Blyth, Ontario during the summer 2008 season. It was a finalist for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language drama in 2008. The play was remounted again in the company&#x27;s 2009 season and was again playing in 2013 in various Ontario localities including Toronto, Ottawa and at London Community Players in London. Its Western Canadian premiere was at Langara College&#x27;s Studio 58 in 2014.

The 2020 film &quot;Marlene&quot; tells the story of the Steven Truscott (Greg Bryk) case and how his wife Marlene Truscott (Kristin Booth) worked tirelessly to clear her husband&#x27;s name by exposing lies, cover-ups, and police mishandling of the case.

<doc id="1116656" wikidata="Q721225" url="?curid=1116656" title="John Wesley Davis">
<text>John Wesley Davis (April 16, 1799 – August 22, 1859) was an American physician and Democratic politician, active in the mid-1800s. He is best known for serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Governor of the Oregon Territory, and as a four-time member of the Indiana state legislature.

==Early life and education==
Davis was born in New Holland, Pennsylvania, on April 16, 1799, and later moved to Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, with his parents. Davis graduated from Baltimore Medical College in 1821, then moved to Carlisle, Indiana, in 1823 and practiced medicine there. He married Ann Hoover on November 19, 1820.

His daughter, Caroline Davis, married James C. Denny, Indiana Attorney General (1872–1874). Their son, Frank Lee Denny, was a colonel of the U.S. Marine Corps who served in the Egyptian Expedition of 1882, the U.S. intervention in Panama in 1885, and the Spanish–American War.

==Political career==

===State politics===
Davis started his political career as an unsuccessful candidate for the Indiana Senate in 1828. He instead became a state court judge in Indiana from 1829 to 1831. He was elected a member of the Indiana House of Representatives four times, serving terms beginning in 1831, 1841, 1851, and 1857. He was Speaker of the Indiana House from 1832 to 1833 and again from 1841 to 1842 and 1851 to 1852.

===National politics===
He served as a U.S. Representative from Indiana in the 24th, 26th, 28th and 29th Congresses and was Speaker of the U.S. House in the 29th Congress. From 1848 to 1850 he was U.S. Diplomatic Commissioner to China. In 1852 he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Indiana.

===Governorship===
Davis was appointed to the office of Governor of the Oregon Territory in 1853 by President Franklin Pierce. His appointment was not welcomed by Oregonians, however, and he left office just over a year later, with the position returning to his predecessor, Secretary of the Territory George Law Curry.

==Death==
Davis died in Carlisle, Indiana on August 22, 1859. He was buried at City Cemetery in Carlisle.

<doc id="1116657" wikidata="Q758079" url="?curid=1116657" title="Pixiu">
<text>Pixiu (; ) is a Chinese mythical hybrid creature. Pixiu are considered powerful protectors of the souls of the dead, &quot;xian&quot;, and feng shui practitioners, and resemble strong, winged lions. A Pixiu is an earth and sea variation, particularly an influential and auspicious creature for wealth, and is said to have a voracious appetite exclusively for gold, silver, and jewels. Therefore, traditionally to the Chinese, Pixiu have always been regarded as auspicious creatures that possessed mystical powers capable of drawing &quot;cai qi&quot; ( wealth) from all directions, and according to the Chinese zodiac, it is especially helpful for those who are going through a bad year.

There are two types of Pixiu that are categorised by their antlers. The one with two antlers is the female and is called a &quot;Bìxié&quot;, and the one with one antler is the male and is called a &quot;Tiānlù&quot;.

*&quot;Bìxié&quot; (; lit. &quot;to ward off evil spirits&quot;): The female of the species wards off evil. It is also believed that &quot;Bìxié&quot; have the ability to assist anyone who is suffering from bad feng shui from having offended Tai Sui ().
*&quot;Tiānlù&quot; (): The male of the species is in charge of wealth. It is said to go out into the world to search for gold and other forms of wealth. When it returns to its master&#x27;s house, the &quot;Bìxié&quot; is then said to guard the riches. Displaying &quot;Tiānlù&quot; at home or in the office is said to prevent wealth from flowing away.

Pixiu crave the smell of gold and silver and like to bring their masters money in their mouth. Statues of this creature are often used to attract wealth in feng shui.

Today, Pixiu are a popular design on jade pendants.

==Characteristics==
Pixiu are auspicious, winged animals, written about in ancient Chinese history and heralded through the millennia by fantastic stories of powerful and grandiose feats of victory in battle. Their legend has been passed down through 2,000 years of Chinese lore. They have the head of a Chinese dragon, the body of a lion, and historically sport on their heads either one antler (male) or two antlers (female). In modern times, this legendary creature&#x27;s historical physical appearance has been somewhat lost, and is now more commonly depicted with only one antler.

Ancient Chinese descriptions, depictions and stone carvings of Pixiu from the Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD) show the male with a single antler and the female with two. As with the Chinese phoenix, the common image today represents a single gender with one antler (male). Pixiu have protruding eyes and sharp teeth. There is one ancient stone sculpture variation found with hooves, but all Pixiu have wings. Many have a bifurcated (split) tail that hangs low and downward that covers its rear, a representative metaphor that they hold gold inside their stomachs but will not let it out.

Imperial &quot;Pixiu&quot; used during the Qing dynasty developed the physical characteristic of a fatter, more rotund body, indicating a stomach that could be loaded with unlimited amounts of gold and all forms of wealth and good fortune.

Due to their similar appearances, Pixiu are often confused with stone lions and qilin, but they can easily be distinguished from those two animals by its pair of feathered wings with which it can fly between Heaven and Earth.

In the Eastern Han dynasty, pixiu were thought to be able to fly into the realm of immortals or &quot;xian&quot; by Daoists and a minority of Confucianists.

==Mythology==
One story of the Pixiu says that it violated a law of Heaven by defecating on the floor of Heaven. When it was found out, it was punished by a spanking from the Jade Emperor. The spanking was hard enough to cause its anus to be permanently sealed. The Jade Emperor further declared that the diet of the Pixiu would be restricted to gold, silver, and jewels.

Another story describes the Pixiu as the well-behaved, youngest son of the Dragon King and was spoiled by its parents. One day, Pixiu played on the Dragon King&#x27;s desk and accidentally broke a seal that represented the power of the Dragon King. The Dragon King became very angry and used magic to turn Pixiu into an animal. He then sealed his rectum and declared that from then on, Pixiu could only eat things representing wealth.

Pixiu have a reputation of being fierce creatures. The large fangs visible in their mouths are used to attack demons and evil spirits, draining their essence and converting it to wealth. Pixiu also guard against disease caused by these evil spirits. It is written that Pixiu patrol the Heavens to keep demons at bay and to protect their owners from all harm.

It was believed that the ferociously devoted Pixiu would always and constantly guard its master, even after he passed from this life onto the next world. It was also believed that Pixiu would help their masters ascend to heaven by flying them up to Heaven on their backs.

==History==
Pixiu appear to have their origin in the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) where they are found mentioned and were originally called &quot;Táo bá&quot; in chapter 96 of the Book of Han.

An annotation describes the female and male &quot;Táo bá&quot; to have antlers like a deer, where the male (&quot;Tiānlù&quot;) has one antler, and the female (&quot;Bìxié&quot;) two. In tribute to the legend of the ferocity and prowess of the Pixiu in battle, it became synonymous with the army in ancient China. The word &quot;Pixiu&quot;, interpreted as meaning &quot;fierce beast&quot; and also &quot;brave warrior&quot;, was used as a symbol on battle flags and banners.

Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty declared that the Pixiu, who obtained and guarded the Master&#x27;s gold, would be forever known as the &quot;Treasure of the Emperor&quot;. It is said the Emperor declared that only royal personage could possess a Pixiu and it was strictly forbidden for all others to own one, including officials. This law was kept through to the end of the Qing dynasty.

==Architecture==
During China&#x27;s history, Pixiu were commonly displayed in ancient architecture to ward off y&quot;in qi&quot; () and to harness auspicious &quot;qi&quot;.

Statues of Pixiu are commonly found on the four corners of the roofs of houses, palaces and halls of the most important people such as the Chinese Emperor. The Pixiu sits behind the dragon, the phoenix, the winged horse, the seahorse, and other, similar creatures.

In ancient China, stone statues of Pixiu were also used as tomb guardians of Han dynasty emperors and other royal persons.

==Feng shui==

In feng shui, Pixiu ( &quot;Piyao&quot; in some modern cultural translations) is the heavenly variation of a creature of good fortune. They are said to have the power to assist anyone suffering from bad feng shui due to having offended Tai Sui.

==Gallery==
==In popular culture==
In &quot;Mulan&quot;. Pixiu is featured as a design on the sword of Fa Mulan&#x27;s.

In &quot;DuckTales&quot; of 2017, Pixiu serves as a minor antagonist.

In &quot;American Born Chinese&quot;, Shiji Niangniang has a pet Pixiu that was turned into a dog, along with having his anus sealed, after he pooped in the Jade Emperor&#x27;s pond.
In &quot;Fabulous Beasts&quot; (:zh:有兽焉 or You Shou Yan), one of the main characters in the show is a Pixiu by the name of Tianlu who has a twin brother named Bixie.

<doc id="1116666" wikidata="Q12969" url="?curid=1116666" title="Jacques Cheminade">
<text>Jacques Guy Cheminade (; born 20 August 1941) is a French politician, activist and former diplomat. He is the head of the Solidarity and Progress (SP) party, the French arm of the LaRouche movement. He has thrice run for President of France (1995, 2012, 2017), always placing last.

==Education and professional life==
Cheminade was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina from French parents. He returned to France at age 18. After graduating from HEC Paris, law school, as well as the École nationale d&#x27;administration (ÉNA), Cheminade became a career officer in the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations of the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry, a position he held until 1981.

==Political career==
===Discovery of LaRouche&#x27;s ideas===

Cheminade met Lyndon LaRouche in early 1974 in New York, where he was a commercial attaché to the French embassy from 1972 to 1977. He compares this encounter to Socratic midwifery. According to a 1976 FBI document, he was then a &quot;rank and file member&quot; in the National Caucus of Labor Committees, a political organization directed by Lyndon LaRouche which had founded its own &quot;intelligence units&quot; in 1971, where he &quot;work[ed] in the International Intelligence Section&quot; (see document, left). His return to France in 1977 was motivated by a desire to devote himself &quot;full time to political activities and the advocacy of Mr. LaRouche&#x27;s ideas and policies&quot;.

===1978: Return to France===
In 1978, he was the Parti Ouvrier Européen (POE) candidate for the legislative election in the 18th arrondissement of Paris (25th circonscription), and obtained 0.12% of the votes. His program was:
* the creation of military force with beam weapons to protect Europe against the USSR;
* the fight against drugs and for the promotion of moral values;
* the fight against the IMF and against the economic crisis.

===1981: Head of POE, support for Giscard===
In 1981, Cheminade became the general secretary of the European Workers Party and the president of the French section of the Schiller Institute, and took a leave from his work as a civil servant. He tried unsuccessfully to obtain the endorsements necessary to run for the presidential election of 1981, and called before the first round to vote for Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, saying: &quot;I call upon all my partisans and friends to vote for Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Three reasons prescribe that choice: his nuclear policy, his conception of détente and his commitment to fight monetarism. Moreover, he is in the best position to defeat François Mitterrand, whose candidacy poses the gravest and most immediate danger&quot;.

===1982–1985: Defense of SDI===
In 1982, Cheminade published a statement presenting the POE as a &quot;pole of reference for all anti-Malthusian forces committed to reestablish economic growth and cultural morality&quot; and advocating a program &quot;similar to that of Lyndon LaRouche&#x27;s National Democratic Policy Committee&quot;, which included at that time freedom from &quot;British domination of American foreign policy&quot;, worldwide public works projects, the development of nuclear energy &quot;to stop genocide&quot; in undeveloped nations, a crackdown on an international drug cartel, and a return to classic education to counter &quot;the genocidalists&#x27; plan for our youth&quot;.

In 1983, Cheminade published a statement on the danger of &quot;new fascism&quot; posed by an alleged plot against French president François Mitterrand by some of his socialist ministers, including Jacques Delors and Michel Rocard. The next year, he published an article in &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot;, accusing French president François Mitterrand of being a &quot;Soviet agent of influence&quot;, as well as &quot;the servant of the &quot;families&quot; involved in the Swiss-promoted &quot;synarchist&quot; operations that launched the fascist movement back in the 1920s on an international scale&quot;.

During the 1984 European elections, where the POE list he headed obtained 0.09% of the votes, Cheminade defended a program centered on the fight against three threats: an &quot;immediate Russian threat that remains unperceived if not strongly favored&quot;); an economic and financial one caused by &quot;rampant Malthusianism and the role of the International Monetary Fund&quot;; and a moral and intellectual decay, exemplified by the consumption of dangerous drugs. His program also referenced the ideas of Lazare Carnot, a &quot;Republican scientist&quot;, Jean Jaurès, the only Socialist &quot;with broad ideas&quot; and the only one who &quot;knew Leibniz and the pre-Socratic philosophers&quot;, as well as Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who also &quot;understood the epistemological foundations of France&quot;.

During the period of time from 1982 to 1984, according to his own statement, Cheminade was involved in arranging a number of meetings between &quot;French government, military and political leaders, and Mr. LaRouche [...] primarily on the subject of the SDI [the Strategic Defense Initiative (&quot;SDI&quot;)] and its European complement, the Tactical Defense Initiative (&quot;TDI&quot;)&quot;.

During the 1985 county elections, where his party presented candidates in 50 counties, Cheminade declared the POE &quot;wholeheartedly supports Reagan&#x27;s SDI program, a development program for the third world and a change in economic policy away from the International Monetary Fund&quot;. Later the same year, he said &quot;unless the policies of the IMF are reversed, the Soviets will rule Europe and most of the rest of the world within this decade&quot;.

===1986: French PANIC proposals===
In 1986, while in the United States the Larouche movement presented the PANIC proposal, Cheminade, at a press conference held together with John Seale – a British physician who claimed that HIV had been created in a Soviet laboratory as part of a plot to destroy the United States, &quot;ridiculed&quot; the &quot;condom campaigns&quot; run in many countries and claimed that AIDS could be transmitted by saliva – presented the draft of a law providing for every resident of France to be screened for AIDS every six months, and every non-resident crossing the border into France to show an AIDS-negative
test certificate dating from less than six months before, or be tested, before he could be admitted into France. Another proposition of the same draft was to quarantine &quot;full-blown AIDS cases until an effective vaccine and cure are found&quot;. Later the same year, he contributed to a conference organized by the French section of the Fusion Energy Foundation on &quot;The Importance of the Method of Louis Pasteur for Conquering AIDS and Other Pandemics&quot;, where Dr Whiteside developed his views on the transmission of AIDS by mosquito bites, with a speech where he called &quot;upon France to defend Science in the face of the brutal irrationalist attacks on Science&quot;.

===1986: First appearance on national TV===
During the campaign for the legislative election of 1986, the POE having presented more than 75 candidates in 27 departments, Cheminade was for the first time granted 8 minutes of national television time, and presented a program which included:
* an abolition of the International Monetary Fund;
* an industrialization of the Third World;
* a French Strategic Defense Initiative in cooperation with the United States, and deployment of the neutron bomb;
* a &quot;Colbertist&quot; approach to finance productive investments;
* an elimination of EC quotas to increase farm output;
* a war on drugs and terrorism;
* and an introduction of a classical education curriculum.

===1987–1989: The end of the POE===
In 1987, Cheminade, described by Daniel Carton in &quot;Le Monde&quot; as the leader of a &quot;far-right small group&quot;, announced he would run for the 1988 presidential election with a five-point program: a Marshall plan for the third world, a reform of the international monetary system, a biological defense initiative, the relaunch of spatial programs and a European version of the SDI. He did not succeed to gather the necessary number of endorsements to back him.

In 1989, Cheminade headed the POE&#x27;s list for the European Parliament election, called &quot;Rassemblement pour une France libre&quot; (Movement for a Free France). Its program was to fight against &quot;European financial cartels dominated by the London stock market&quot; and to promote &quot;the construction of Europe by means of large public works&quot;. Larousse&#x27;s &quot;Journal of the year&quot; considered these positions were close to those expressed by the far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen. The list obtained 0.18% of the votes.

He remained general secretary of the &quot;Parti Ouvrier Européen&quot; until its dissolution for bankruptcy in 1989. The POE was replaced in 1991 by the &quot;Fédération pour une Nouvelle Solidarité&quot; (FNS, Federation for a New Solidarity).

===1991–1995: The FNS replaces the POE===
In 1993, he was the sole candidate of his movement for the legislative election in Paris and obtained 0.32% of the votes.

===1992: Theft trial===
In 1992, Cheminade was condemned with suspension to 15 months of imprisonment for theft. He was charged of having received, through 3 associations, 1.2 million francs from an elderly lady with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. An appellate court confirmed in 1996 the qualification of theft, but reduced the sentence to 9 months with suspension. The judgement mentioned &quot;conditioning&quot; by &quot;professional canvassers&quot;. The reduced sentence allowed Cheminade to benefit from an amnesty law.

===1995: Presidential candidate===
In 1995, Cheminade obtained 556 endorsements from mayors, allowing him to run in the presidential election. Eric Incyan and Sylvie Kaufman in &quot;Le Monde&quot; described the obtaining of these endorsements as the result of a &quot;generalized phone harassment&quot;. According to Daniel Hourquebie in &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Cheminade&#x27;s envoys targeted the mayors of small rural villages, presumed to favor small candidates and 7 out of 8 of Cheminade&#x27;s endorsers in the department of Gers administered municipalities of less than 165 inhabitants. According to Renaud Dely in &quot;Libération&quot;, they pointed out to left-leaning mayors that Cheminade &quot;filled a void&quot; in the absence of Jacques Delors, while offering them a copy of Jean Jaurès doctoral thesis republished in 1994 by Cheminade&#x27;s party press with a foreword by Cheminade (described as an absurd rambling by Roger-Pol Droit in &quot;Le Monde&quot;; to right-leaning mayors, the &quot;need of defense against Russia&quot;; to thoses with a concern for environment, his concern for a re-emphasis of the rural world. The mayors of Ayguetinte, Bézues-Bajon and Saint-Justin said Cheminade&#x27;s envoys had been the first ones to contact them. The mayor of Ayguetinte said he wanted to express his dissatisfaction with the political class. Other mayors commented on the insistence of Cheminade&#x27;s emissaries : The mayor of Thoux said he finally accepted to be left in peace. The mayor of Planèzes that he was constantly called, at any hour, at home or at the office. Three mayors from Creuse considered they had been &quot;deceived&quot; on Cheminade&#x27;s program and political career. The mayor of Saint-Junien-la-Bregère said he was for sorry to have signed for somebody &quot;who does not seem to be very honest, though I don&#x27;t have a proof&quot;. The mayor of Sannat said on television: &quot;I was told they were against racism, they seemed to be leaning to the left and he was a small candidate. But when I learned he was at the far-right and had been condemned, I jumped&quot;. Cheminade replied they had been harassed by journalists who told them he was a crank and his party was a sect.

His speeches, invoking the patronages of Jean Jaurès and Charles de Gaulle, were centered on a &quot;speculative cancer&quot; destroying the world economy and for which Cheminade was blaming the &quot;financial oligarchy&quot; of the City of London, Wall Street, the Federal Reserve and the IMF, as well as their French &quot;relays&quot;, such as the Banque de France. He advocated bankrupting agents of the international monetary and financial system, a &quot;new Marshall Plan&quot; and credit control.

Cheminade obtained 0.27% of the votes.

According to &quot;El Pais&quot;, his campaign raised little interest except for the origin of its funding. According to Cécile Chambaud in &quot;Le Monde&quot;, LaRouche was a &quot;billionaire&quot; and Cheminade&#x27;s POE had always benefited of &quot;large financial means&quot;. LaRouche sent a letter to &quot;Le Monde&quot; claiming he did not own his residence and his only revenue was his salary at &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot;&quot;. Didier Micoine wrote in &quot;Le Parisien&quot; that Jacques Cheminade claimed to have a taxable income of 42,000 francs, to live with 6,000 francs a month and to own a 10-year-old Peugeot 305. Renaud Leblond and Loïc Stavidrès reported in &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; Cheminade owned a apartment in Paris, earned 3,000 francs a month and benefited from the remains of a family inheritance. Nevertheless, according to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Cheminade claimed to be the largest donator of his campaign.

===Constitutional Court ruling over campaign finance===

The 1995 presidential election was the first one for which the Constitutional Council had to appreciate the regularity of campaign accounts, in application of a law passed in January 1990. The Council examined the campaign accounts with what Jean-Claude Zarka, a professor of constitutional law, called &quot;obvious caution&quot; and Pierre Moscovici, the campaign treasurer of the socialist Lionel Jospin, &quot;eminent diplomacy&quot;. The campaign accounts of 8 candidates were approved, some with modifications, but those of Jacques Cheminade were rejected. According to Zarka, Cheminade was &quot;financed after the vote by substantial gifts from private persons&quot;. The ruling of the Council said 2.3 million francs of private loans had to be qualified as gifts because of their relative importance in the accounts and the absence of interests. Moreover, 1.7 million francs, &quot;over a third of the total of his declared receipts&quot;, was contracted after the second round. Following the rejection of his accounts, Cheminade was deprived of the lump-sum reimbursement of his campaign expenses and required to reimburse a million francs he had received from the state at the start of the campaign. In further observations, the Council recommended private loans to presidential candidates should be prohibited. Notwithstanding, Cheminade claimed the Civil code did not require a loan to bear interest, an assertion later confirmed by a lawyer specialized in civil law consulted by &quot;Le Journal du Dimanche&quot;. He also claimed Roland Dumas, the president of the council, had a conflict of interest with him, having represented his opponents in a libel case some years earlier.

Cheminade appealed to the European Court of Justice, but his appeal was rejected. The Court estimated &quot;the patrimonial incidence of a procedure pertaining to the conditions of practice of a right of political nature does nor confer to it a civil nature&quot; and &quot;the decision of the Constitutional Council has not deprived the plaintiff of property in any amount of money but has only obliged the plaintiff to reimburse to the state a million francs because he did not meet the legal conditions to claim the contractual reimbursement of the campaign expenses&quot;.

In November 2010, in the wake of an on the financing of Édouard Balladur&#x27;s 1995 presidential campaign, Raphaëlle Bacqué and Pascale Robert-Diard wrote in &quot;Le Monde&quot; the Constitutional Council had hesitated to validate his campaign accounts, as they showed 10 million francs in receipts of unknown origin. This, according to &quot;Le Parisien&quot;, was later confirmed by Jacques Robert, a member of the court. According to &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;, Jacques Robert said: &quot;In order to show that we were independent, we invalidated Jacques Cheminade, even though he had only committed minor errors&quot;. Raphaëlle Bacqué commented in &quot;Le Monde&quot; this revelation provided Cheminade a new argument to bail himself out of the litigation with the tax authority which followed the rejection of his campaign accounts.

===Since 1996: S&amp;P replaces FNS===
Since 1996, he has been the chairman of one of LaRouche&#x27;s political parties, &quot;Solidarité et Progrès&quot; (Solidarity and Progress).

In 1996, Cheminade wrote an article in &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; entitled &quot;Time To Destroy The Mythology of Bonapartism&quot;. He claimed &quot;the British-French &#x27;Entente Cordiale&#x27; is, today, the main threat to world history [...] and it is Napoleon who burned the French state to ashes, and his degenerate brothers and descendants, his famiglia, who sold whatever they had to the British&quot;. According to this article, Napoleon had been &quot;brought to madness&quot; by the &quot;mental control&quot; of the British &quot;oligarchical order&quot;, becoming a &quot;pirate for the oligarchs&quot;. Cheminade added : &quot;Napoleon, like Hitler, was first promoted by the British, as were the Jacobins before them, to destroy France, and to prevent a truly republican option&quot;. He further claimed : &quot;Beyond the destruction of the French nation-state, what comes clearly to the light of day, is the second historical role assigned to Napoleon: the promotion of paganism, to destroy the humanist world liberation project. Against such a project, Napoleon was the dangerous but useful idiot of the oligarchs&quot;.

In 1997, shortly after the death of Princess Diana, Cheminade wrote an article in &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot;, next to an article by Lyndon LaRouche claiming &quot;officials of France&#x27;s Socialist government [...] supervised the death of Princess Diana&quot; and introducing Cheminade&#x27;s own article as &quot;an insider&#x27;s view of the decadent, doomed tradition which Mitterrand&#x27;s Presidency set into place&quot;. Cheminade&#x27;s own article claimed President Mitterrand was &quot;an agent of British influence&quot;, &quot;all governments in France, since at least 1980, have continuously and persistently betrayed the sovereignty of their nation-state [...] It is uniquely in that context, that the Lady Diana case can be understood&quot;.

In 1998, Cheminade claimed his party was the only one &quot;to call for a positive alternative to the euro, with a New Bretton Woods system [and] a Eurasian Land-Bridge&quot;. The same year, he claimed the trial of Roland Dumas and the murder of prefect Claude Erignac were &quot;connected [...]to the international financial and monetary implosion, and to the British games in Europe and beyond&quot;. In 1999, he wrote : &quot;The cause of the war is not Iraq, or Yugoslavia, the United States, or even Britain. It is the financial oligarchy of the City of London and Wall Street which has declared war on the people, in Africa, in
Russia, and elsewhere, where living standards and life expectancy are collapsing. The leading role in all cases has been
played by the British.&quot;

In 2000, Cheminade wrote &quot;the assassins of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King [...] were the same people who tried to murder de Gaulle, for the same oligarchical reasons&quot;. The same year, after the crash of Air France Flight 4590, he claimed it could be due to a sabotage, as the French authorities had &quot;challenged the Anglo-American oligarchy in many areas&quot;.

In 2000, Cheminade announced he would be a candidate in the 2002 presidential election. He did not succeed to reach the necessary 500 endorsements, gathering only 406 of them. He sued , another presidential candidate, for slander and was granted damages. Cheminade filed a complaint to the Conseil constitutionnel, arguing he had been the subject of press attacks to deter mayors from endorsing him. The claim was rejected.

In 2001, Cheminade proposed the issuance of a gold based euro, &quot;as a measure of national emergency under the present circumstances&quot;, with reference to &quot;initiatives taken in Russia and Malaysia going in the same direction, with for example the issuance of the Russian golden chervonets&quot;. This was part of what LaRouche and Cheminade called a &quot;new Bretton Woods&quot;, defined by Cheminade in 2003 as &quot;a system of stable exchanges, based on a common reference, a gold-reserve system (and not a gold standard system), gold being used among states to settle their accounts, but not as a basis for credit&quot;.

In 2004, Cheminade and Eric Sauzé, his party&#x27;s candidate in the March 2004 Lyon county election were found guilty of slander against Dominique Perben, the minister of Justice, for the comparison in pictures of Philippe Pétain shaking hands with Adolf Hitler in Montoire-sur-le-Loir and Perben recently doing the same with U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. Cheminade was condemned to pay a fine of 15,000 euros. The judgement considered the leaflet made &quot;a comparison between two periods of the history of France that have strictly nothing in common in terms of human and citizens’ rights&quot; and Cheminade had &quot;the objective disposition of resources that allowed them to print 25,000 copies of [the] leaflet&quot;. the judgement was confirmed in appeal in 2006.

In the 2004 European election, Cheminade headed list called &quot;Nouvelle solidarité&quot; in Île-de-France, which obtained 0.11% of the votes.

In 2004, during the restructuring of the Argentinian debt, which laRouche compared to &quot;&quot;transform[ing] Argentina into another Auschwitz&quot;, Cheminade organized protests in Paris, such as the distribution of leaflets claiming &quot;that what happens in Argentina, will happen tomorrow in France, Germany, and all of Europe, and the United States, unless we take the road LaRouche has indicated, which is the New Bretton Woods&quot; or organizing a demonstration in front of the headquarters of Lazard, the bank advising the Argentinian government.

Cheminade opposed the European constitution proposed in the 2005 referendum, claiming it was a policy leading to fascism and to war.

In November 2005, Cheminade was a panelist at the conference of &quot;Axis for Peace&quot; organized by the Voltaire network in Belgium.

In the 2007 French presidential race, he endorsed Ségolène Royal.

===2012: Second presidential candidacy===
On 31 January 2012 Cheminade announced that he had obtained the necessary 500 endorsements from elected officials that are required for ballot status in the presidential election. Cheminade ran on a platform of:
*separation of commercial banking from investment banking, to end the &quot;casino economy.&quot;
*a system of public credit for major development projects.
*investment in &quot;human creativity.&quot;
*a Eurasian/Transpacific alliance against the &quot;world of finance.&quot;
*the removal of heads of state who &quot;lead us blindly into chaos and war.&quot;
He obtained 89,000 votes (0.25% of the votes) nationwide.

===2017: Third presidential candidacy===

In the first round of voting for the 2017 French presidential election, Cheminade was in last place of 11 candidates, receiving 65,598 votes, or 0.18% of votes cast.

<doc id="1116685" wikidata="Q15846515" url="?curid=1116685" title="Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)">
<text>Saturday Review, previously The Saturday Review of Literature, was an American weekly magazine established in 1924. Norman Cousins was the editor from 1940 to 1971. Under Cousins, it was described as &quot;a compendium of reportage, essays and criticism about current events, education, science, travel, the arts and other topics.&quot;

At its peak, &quot;Saturday Review&quot; was influential as the base of several widely read critics (e.g., Wilder Hobson, music critic Irving Kolodin, and theater critics John Mason Brown and Henry Hewes), and was often known by its initials as SR. It was never very profitable and eventually succumbed to the decline of general-interest magazines after restructuring and trying to reinvent itself more than once during the 1970s and 1980s.

==History==

From 1920 to 1924, &quot;Literary Review&quot; was a Saturday supplement to the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. Henry Seidel Canby established it as a separate publication in 1924. Bernard DeVoto was the editor in 1936–1938. In 1950, John Barkham became book reviewer there. Until 1952, it was known as &quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot;.

The magazine was purchased by the McCall Corporation in 1961.
&quot;Saturday Review&quot; reached its maximum circulation of 660,000 under the editorship (1940–1971) of Norman Cousins.
Longtime editor Cousins resigned when it was sold, along with McCall Books, to a group led by the two co-founders of &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, which they had recently sold to Boise Cascade. They split the magazine into four separate monthlies and renamed the publishing company Saturday Review Press, but the experiment ended in insolvency two years later. Former editor Cousins purchased it and recombined the units with &quot;World&quot;, a new magazine that he had started in the meantime. Briefly it was called &quot;SR World&quot; before it reverted to &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. Saturday Review Press was sold separately to E. P. Dutton.

The magazine was sold in 1977 to a group led by Carll Tucker, who sold it in 1980 to Macro Communications, the owner of the business magazine &quot;Financial World&quot;. It was insolvent again in 1982 and was sold to Missouri entrepreneur Jeffrey Gluck . A new group of investors in 1984 resurrected it briefly. According to Greg Lindsay writing for &quot;Folio&quot; twenty years later, most people consider 1982 &quot;the year &quot;Saturday Review&quot; died&quot;.

&quot;Penthouse&quot; publisher Bob Guccione acquired all properties in 1987 and used the title briefly from 1993 for an online publication at AOL.

==Revival==
In December 2010, business columnist for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; Joseph N. DiStefano reported in his blog that John T. Elduff of JTE Multimedia planned to &quot;revive&quot; both &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Saturday Review&quot; as print and online magazines — mainly print, &quot;for Americans 55 to 90&quot;. Both would &quot;have a liberal share of attention to research&quot; and look like they did in the 1950s.

In 2011, JTE Multimedia made use of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; name with its website, &quot;Saturday Review–Drug Trials&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;saturday-reviewdrugtrials.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to report on clinical drug research, focusing on inconclusive and adverse trial results. The site disappeared in 2016, with its home page essentially unchanged since its launch date.

<text>is a Tōshō-gū Shinto shrine located in Nikkō, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan.

Together with Futarasan Shrine and Rinnō-ji, it forms the Shrines and Temples of Nikkō UNESCO World Heritage Site, with 42 structures of the shrine included in the nomination. Five of them are designated as National Treasures of Japan, and three more as Important Cultural Properties.

== History ==

Tōshō-gū is dedicated to Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate. It was initially built in 1617, during the Edo period, while Ieyasu&#x27;s son Hidetada was &quot;shōgun&quot;. It was enlarged during the time of the third shōgun, Iemitsu. Ieyasu is enshrined there, where his remains are also entombed. This shrine was built by Tokugawa retainer Tōdō Takatora.

During the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate carried out stately processions from Edo to the Nikkō Tōshō-gū along the Nikkō Kaidō. The shrine&#x27;s annual spring and autumn festivals reenact these occasions, and are known as &quot;processions of a thousand warriors&quot;. Cedar trees line the roadway, termed the Cedar Avenue of Nikkō.

Five structures at Nikkō Tōshō-gū are categorized as National Treasures of Japan, and three more as Important Cultural Properties. Additionally, two swords in the possession of the shrine are National Treasures, and many other objects are Important Cultural Properties. Famous buildings at the Tōshō-gū include the richly decorated Yōmeimon (陽明門), a gate that is also known as &quot;higurashi-no-mon&quot;. The latter name means that one could look at it until sundown, and not tire of seeing it. Carvings in deep relief, painted in rich colors, decorate the surface of the structure. The next gate is the &quot;karamon&quot; decorated with white ornaments. Located nearby is a woodcarving of a sleepy cat, &quot;Nemuri-neko&quot;, attributed to Hidari Jingorō.

The stable of the shrine&#x27;s sacred horses bears a carving of the three wise monkeys, who hear, speak and see no evil, a traditional symbol in Japanese culture that is derived from a quote in the &quot;Analects&quot;. 

The original five-storey pagoda was donated by a &quot;daimyō&quot; in 1650, but it was burned down during a fire, and was rebuilt in 1818. Each storey represents an element–earth, water, fire, wind and aether (or void)–in ascending order. Inside the pagoda, a central &quot;shinbashira&quot; pillar hangs from chains to minimize damage from earthquakes.

Hundreds of stone steps lead through the cryptomeria forest up to the grave of Ieyasu. A torii at the top bears calligraphy attributed to Emperor Go-Mizunoo. A bronze urn contains the remains of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

In 2008, Yuri Kawasaki became the first female Shinto priest ever to serve at Nikkō Tōshō-gū.

<text>David Paisley (born 2 February 1979) is a Scottish actor, domestic violence and LGBTQIA+ rights campaigner, known for roles as midwife Ben Saunders in &quot;Holby City&quot;, Ryan Taylor in &quot;Tinsel Town&quot; and Rory Murdoch in &quot;River City&quot;. Some of his characters have been controversial due to their sexual orientation.

==Early life==
Paisley is the son of author Janet Paisley, and is one of seven children. He was voted &#x27;Britain&#x27;s sexiest man&#x27; by readers of &quot;Gay Times&quot; magazine in 2003. He grew up in Glen Village near Falkirk. At 15 years of age, Paisley went to an LGBT group where he eventually met his first partner. At 17, he attended the University of Glasgow to study physics, during which time he appeared in a community workshop (part of 7:84 theatre company in Glasgow) and then studied Optometry at Glasgow Caledonian University. At 18, he came out to his family who were supportive and helped in his efforts campaigning against the Keep the Clause campaign.

==Career==
Paisley began acting as a teenage boy when he heard about an open audition for television drama &quot;Tinsel Town&quot;, a 1999-2000 television drama (co-produced by BBC Scotland and Raindog/Deep Indigo Productions). He went on to play one of the main characters, Ryan Taylor, the 17-year-old partner of a police officer.

Later, Paisley appeared in a few stage productions. Then in 2002, he landed the part of midwife Ben Saunders in BBC1&#x27;s popular medical soap &quot;Holby City&quot;. Ben&#x27;s kiss with his on-screen same-sex partner attracted 114 complaints from viewers.

In 2008, Paisley starred in the short film &quot;Sweat&quot;, which was screened at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, and selected for screening at NewFest in New York, June 2008.

Paisley completed filming on his regular role as Rory Murdoch on BBC Scotland&#x27;s &quot;River City&quot;, the son of gangster Lenny Murdoch and departed the show in 2009.

Paisley starred as &#x27;Madam&#x27; Gary in the play &quot;The Backroom&quot; by Adrian Pagan at The Cock Tavern Theatre in Kilburn, London in March–May 2009, where he provided a &#x27;particularly credible&#x27; performance as his &#x27;nervy and paranoid&#x27; character.

In May 2009, he also starred as Michael in the successful stage production of &quot;Muhmah&quot; at the HighTide Festival. In 2009–10, he took to the stage again in the UK Tour of &quot;Over The Rainbow: The Eva Cassidy Story&quot;, in which he played the part of Dan Cassidy.

In 2010, he made his directorial debut with the play &quot;The Lasses, O&quot; (written by his mother Janet Paisley). at the Edinburgh Festival. He also starred as Rick in the 2010 horror film &quot;Unhappy Birthday&quot;.

In 2013, Paisley &quot;starred&quot; in a short film produced for the Dutch Film Festival called &quot;Fall-out&quot;, described as a post-apocalyptic romantic comedy.

In 2016, he played the role of Saki in Katherine Rundell&#x27;s &quot;Life According to Saki&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe; the play went on to win the Carol Tambor Best of Edinburgh Award and subsequently toured Off-off-Broadway.

In November 2019, he returned to &quot;River City&quot; as Rory Murdoch, back from the dead having faked his own suicide.

Paisley is a vegetarian. He was voted &#x27;Britain&#x27;s sexiest man&#x27; by readers of &quot;Gay Times&quot; magazine in 2003. In 2021, SNP MP Joanna Cherry alleged he had defamed her on Twitter, though he denied this and Cherry did not take the matter to court.

In March 2021, Paisley was nominated for &#x27;&quot;Awesome&quot; Ally of the Year&#x27; by Diva magazine. In May 2021, Paisley was nominated for &#x27;&quot;Celebrity&quot; of the Year&#x27; at the National Diversity Awards. In June 2021, he was announced as a winner of the Attitude Pride Awards 2021. In August 2021, he was shortlisted for the &quot;Community Champion Award&quot; at the Proud Scotland Awards.

Paisley declared in August 2021 that he would move from Scotland as he &quot;no longer feels safe&quot; after being doxed.

<doc id="1116715" wikidata="Q5292510" url="?curid=1116715" title="Don Denkinger">
<text>Donald Anton Denkinger (; August 28, 1936 – May 12, 2023) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball (MLB) who worked in the American League (AL) from 1969 to 1998. Denkinger wore uniform number 11, when the AL adopted uniform numbers in 1980. He is best remembered for an incorrect safe call he made at first base in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series, which came to be known as The Call.

==Personal life==
Denkinger was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, in 1936. He and his wife, Gayle Price, had three daughters, Darcel Nikolajsen, Denise Hanson, and Dana Kelly. Denkinger died at a hospice facility in Waterloo, Iowa, on May 12, 2023, at the age of 86.

==Career==
Denkinger attended Wartburg College, where he was on the wrestling team. After serving in the Army from 1957 to 1959, he began umpiring in the Alabama–Florida League in 1960, joined the AL staff in April 1969, and became an AL crew chief in 1977. In 1975, Denkinger was one of the first American League umpires to switch from the outside chest protector to the inside chest protector, which was used in the National League for decades before finally being adopted in the AL in the late 1970s. All umpires who entered the AL starting in 1977 had to use the inside protector; AL umpires on staff prior to 1977 were grandfathered and could continue to use the outside protector. Denkinger&#x27;s last game using the outside protector was Game 4 of the 1974 World Series.

Denkinger umpired in four World Series: 1974, 1980, 1985, and 1991, serving as crew chief in the 1985 and 1991 World Series. Denkinger also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1971, 1976, and 1987, calling balls and strikes for the last game. He officiated in six American League Championship Series (1972, 1975, 1979, 1982, 1988, 1992), serving as crew chief in 1979, 1982, 1988, and 1992, and in the 1981 and 1995 AL Division Series. He was the home plate umpire for the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game that decided the AL East champion, as the New York Yankees defeated the Boston Red Sox. He was also the home plate umpire of Game 7 in the 1991 World Series when the Minnesota Twins beat the Atlanta Braves 1-0 in ten innings, a game that is considered one of the best games in World Series history.

He was one of seven umpires who worked in two perfect games. Denkinger was the second base umpire for Len Barker&#x27;s perfect game on May 15, 1981, and the first base umpire for Kenny Rogers&#x27; perfect game on July 28, 1994. Denkinger was also the home plate umpire for Nolan Ryan&#x27;s sixth no-hitter on June 11, 1990.

==The Call: 1985 World Series==

Denkinger was the first base umpire in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series. The St. Louis Cardinals led the Kansas City Royals by 3 games to 2 and had taken a 1–0 lead in the eighth inning. The Cardinals had taken the field with a ninth-inning lead 97 times in the 1985 season. They had won 97 times. In the bottom of the ninth, Jorge Orta, the leadoff batter for the Royals, hit a slow ground ball to first baseman Jack Clark, who tossed the ball to the pitcher, Todd Worrell, who was covering first base. Denkinger called Orta safe, even though instant replays (not used by officials for play review until 2008) and photographs clearly showed that he was out by half a step. The Royals went on to win Game 6 by the score of 2–1.

Denkinger believed he had made the right call until he later met with Commissioner Peter Ueberroth after the game and had the opportunity to see the replay himself. He said he was waiting to hear the ball land in Worrell&#x27;s glove while watching the bag for Orta&#x27;s foot and due to the crowd noise he never heard Worrell catch the ball. Denkinger also said that when he looked down to see whether or not Orta&#x27;s foot was on the bag, he saw Orta&#x27;s foot on the bag, so Denkinger called him safe. As crew chief of the 1985 World Series umpiring unit, Denkinger was scheduled to work behind home plate in Game 7, a fact that further upset the Cardinals and manager Whitey Herzog. The Royals won Game 7 by an 11–0 score, with Denkinger ejecting both Herzog and pitcher Joaquín Andújar in the fifth inning, following Andújar&#x27;s animated displeasure with ball and strike calls.

In the immediate aftermath of the 1985 World Series, Denkinger received many hateful letters, including death threats, from Cardinals fans. Two St. Louis disc jockeys went so far as to reveal Denkinger&#x27;s telephone number and home address. Denkinger claimed that the letters continued on through 1987, when the Cardinals were ramping up for another World Series appearance, this time against the Minnesota Twins. Denkinger got into contact with Major League Baseball Security, who in turn contacted the FBI when he received a particularly menacing letter with no return address, in which the writer said that if he saw Denkinger in person, he would &quot;blow him away&quot; with a .357 Magnum. According to Denkinger, FBI agents visited the letter writer and told him, &quot;You&#x27;re done. This is the end of it. You will not correspond with him in any manner, and life will go on.&quot;

===Later career===
Two years later, Denkinger was behind the plate for the All-Star Game, and he was again named crew chief for the 1988 ALCS, 1991 World Series, and 1992 ALCS. He is one of only four umpires to have been selected as crew chief for the ALCS three times.

Denkinger&#x27;s last season as a full-time umpire was 1993. Thereafter, he umpired fewer than 100 games each season until retiring due to a bad right knee, umpiring his final game at Kauffman Stadium on June 2, 1998. Over the course of his career, he umpired 3,824 regular season MLB games.

==Post-umpiring==
Denkinger served as an umpire advisor for a year after retiring. He then spent his time golfing and fishing while also spending time in Arizona, France, Denmark and Illinois, with his family.

More than 20 years after the 1985 series, Denkinger regularly appeared at sports memorabilia shows (including ones in St. Louis) willing to autograph photos depicting &quot;The Call&quot;. In his house, Denkinger had a painting of &quot;The Call&quot; featuring himself, Worrell, and Orta, which was given to him years after the play by an artist and which had previously been prominently displayed at Denkinger&#x27;s restaurant, the Silverfox in Waterloo, Iowa.

<text>[[North Carolina]] is currently divided into 14 congressional districts, each represented by a member of the United States House of Representatives. After the 2000 census, the number of North Carolina&#x27;s seats was increased from 12 to 13 due to the state&#x27;s increase in population. In the 2022 elections, per the 2020 United States census, North Carolina gained one new congressional seat for a total of 14.

==Legal challenges to redistricting==
===1981 redistricting===

In 1981, the North Carolina General Assembly proposed a congressional redistricting plan that split Moore County between two districts, the first time a county in North Carolina had ever been thus divided. The Attorney General of North Carolina recommended revising the plan.

===Constitutionality of the 1990 redistricting===

After the 1990 census, the US Department of Justice directed North Carolina under VRA preclearance to submit a map with two majority-minority districts. The resultant map with two such congressional districts, the 1st and 12th, was the subject of lawsuits by voters who claimed that it was an illegal racial gerrymander. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina dismissed the suit, which was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 28, 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Shaw v. Reno&quot;, found that the 12th congressional district was an unlawful racial gerrymander. Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s opinion found that if a district&#x27;s shape, like the 12th&#x27;s, was &quot;so bizarre on its face that it is &#x27;unexplainable on grounds other than race&#x27;&quot;, that it would be subject to strict scrutiny as a racial gerrymander, and remanded the case to the Eastern District of North Carolina.

On August 22, 1994, the Eastern District of North Carolina on remand in &quot;Shaw v. Hunt&quot; found that the 12th congressional district was a racial gerrymander (as the U.S. Supreme Court had directed), but ruled that the map satisfied strict scrutiny due to the compelling interest of compliance with the Voting Rights Act and increasing black political power. This was again appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reversed the Eastern District of North Carolina on June 13, 1996, and found that the North Carolina plan violated the Equal Protection Clause and that the 12th congressional district did not satisfy a compelling interest.

===Constitutionality of the 1997 redistricting===
North Carolina drew a new map following &quot;Shaw v. Hunt,&quot; and the new maps were challenged in turn. A three-judge panel of the Eastern District of North Carolina granted summary judgment that the new boundaries were an illegal racial gerrymander. This was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in &quot;Hunt v. Cromartie&quot; on May 17, 1999, unanimously ruled that the Eastern District of North Carolina was in error to grant summary judgment and remanded the case for the court to hold a trial.

After the ensuing trial, the Eastern District of North Carolina ruled that the 12th district was an illegal racial gerrymander on March 7, 2000. This was again appealed, now as &quot;Easley v. Cromartie&quot;. The U.S. Supreme Court on April 18, 2001, reversed the Eastern District of North Carolina and ruled that the 12th district boundaries were not racially based but was a partisan gerrymander. They said this was a political question that the courts should not rule upon. Justice O&#x27;Connor, the author of &quot;Shaw v. Hunt&quot;, was the swing justice who switched sides to uphold the district boundaries.

===Constitutionality of the 2010 redistricting===

In February 2016, a three-judge panel of U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and Middle District of North Carolina judges ruled that the 1st and 12th congressional districts&#x27; boundaries were unconstitutional and required new maps to be drawn by the legislature to be used for the 2016 election. On 22 May 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Cooper v. Harris&quot;, agreed that the 1st and 12th congressional district boundaries were unlawful racial gerrymanders, the latest in a series of cases dating back to 1993 by different parties challenging various configurations of those districts since their first creation.

In January 2018 a federal court struck down North Carolina&#x27;s congressional map, declaring it unconstitutionally gerrymandered to favor Republican candidates. The court ordered that the General Assembly must redraw the district maps prior to the 2018 elections. However, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the federal court order pending review, and in June 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot;, by a 5–4 vote, that partisan gerrymandering is a &quot;political question&quot; that the federal courts have no place to rule on.

===Constitutionality of the 2017 redistricting===
On September 3, 2019, a three-judge panel in a 357-page ruling unanimously struck down the Republican-led state legislature drawn 2017 enacted maps, which were drawn to replace the 2011 maps which were also ruled unconstitutional and thrown out on racial grounds. The court ruled that the state House and state Senate districts maps were such an extreme partisan gerrymander that they violated the state constitution. In the ruling the state legislature was ordered by the court to immediately start drawing new maps; the court demanded that they be drawn based on criteria like population, contiguity, and county lines. Districts had to be drawn without &quot;partisan considerations and election results data,&quot; and done so in plain view, a departure from the closed-door processes the ruling eschews. &quot;At a minimum, that would require all map drawing to occur at public hearings, with any relevant computer screen visible to legislators and public observers.&quot; The judges said the new maps had to be completed in two weeks; they also said they reserved the right to move the 2020 primary election if needed.

In October 2019, a panel of three judges ruled that the map was an unfair partisan gerrymander and had to be redrawn. On November 15, 2019, the General Assembly passed a bill that drew new districts that were used for the 2020 elections. The 2nd and 6th congressional districts were drawn to be more favorable to Democrats under the new proposal. On December 2, 2019, a three-judge panel ruled that newly Republican-drawn congressional district maps completed in November 2019 would stand for federal elections in 2020. The maps allowed to stay in place would only be used once. After the 2020 census, the congressional districts would have to be redrawn again.

===Constitutionality of the 2020 redistricting===
On February 4, 2022, the North Carolina Supreme Court struck down the congressional and state legislative district maps drawn by the GOP-controlled General Assembly as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander in a 4–3 ruling, after a testimony had shown that Republicans were likely to win 10 out of 14 U.S. House seats under the proposed map, an increase from the eight out of 13 that they won in the 2020 elections. New maps, which were ordered to be fair in partisan composition, had to be drawn by the General Assembly within two weeks, under state law.

On February 23, 2022, a panel of three former judges chosen by the Wake County Superior Court drew and approved a new remedial congressional map after the court, earlier that day, struck down the congressional district maps passed by the General Assembly on February 17, 2022, as not meeting standards of partisan fairness. The new maps, which were upheld by the North Carolina Supreme Court later in the night, would apply for the 2022 elections. The General Assembly would then be able to redraw new congressional maps for use in 2024 and subsequent elections until new maps will have to be redrawn for 2032.

====Later developments====
On April 28, 2023, the North Carolina Supreme Court—after Republicans gained a majority in the court following the 2022 judicial elections—overturned the same ruling in a 5–2 decision, which cleared the way for gerrymandering in the next redistricting cycle. On October 25, 2023, new maps were approved by the General Assembly. All three new maps heavily favor the GOP, with allegations of racial bias made against the maps as well. Compared to the congressional map used in the 2022 elections, the GOP is expected to at least gain three seats in the House.

In December 2023, two lawsuit were filed in the Middle District of North Carolina, with the first challenging the 1st, 6th, 12th, and 14th congressional districts in the map, and the second, challenging multiple specific districts in the congressional and state legislative district maps, as racial gerrymanders. Both lawsuits were consolidated together in March 2024.

<text>CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) is a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security. CGIAR research aims to reduce rural poverty, increase food security, improve human health and nutrition, and sustainable management of natural resources.

CGIAR research is carried out at 15 centers that collaborate with partners from national and regional research institutes, civil society organizations, academia, development organizations, and the private sector. These research centers are around the globe, with most in the Global South and Vavilov Centers of agricultural crop genetic diversity. CGIAR has an annual research portfolio of just over US$900 million with more than 9,000 staff working in 89 countries.

Funding is provided by national governments, multilateral funding and development agencies and leading private foundations. Representatives of CGIAR Funders and developing countries meet as the CGIAR System Council to keep under review the strategy, mission, impact and continued relevancy of the CGIAR System in a rapidly changing landscape of agricultural research for development.

==Goals==
CGIAR works to help meet the global targets laid out in the Sustainable Development Goals with an emphasis on five areas of impact:

* Nutrition, Health, and Food Security
* Poverty Reduction, Livelihoods, and Jobs
* Gender Equality, Youth, and Social Inclusion
* Climate Adaptation and Mitigation
* Environmental Health and Biodiversity

==Vision and mission==
CGIAR&#x27;s vision is: A world with sustainable and resilient food, land, and water systems that deliver diverse, healthy, safe, sufficient, and affordable diets, and ensure improved livelihoods and greater social equality, within planetary and regional environmental boundaries.

CGIAR&#x27;s mission is to deliver science and innovation that advance transformation of food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis.

== &quot;One CGIAR&quot; reform ==
The concept of a unified and integrated &quot;One CGIAR&quot; was approved by the CGIAR System Council (November 2019) to adapt to rapidly changing global conditions, while also making the CGIAR system more relevant and effective. The fragmented nature of CGIAR&#x27;s governance and institutions had limited the System&#x27;s ability to both respond to increasingly interconnected challenges and to consistently deliver best practice and effectively scaled, research solutions needed to maximise impact. One CGIAR includes a unified governance and management through a reconstituted System Management Board and a new Executive Management Team.

== Research Portfolio ==
CGIAR&#x27;s Research Portfolio consists of Initiatives are major, prioritized areas of investment that bring capacity from within and beyond CGIAR to bear on well-defined, major challenges. Thirty-two Initiatives meet a common set of requirements, articulated in System Council documentation and evaluable through the Independent Science for Development Council quality of research for development criteria.

The Research Portfolio is organized by the three Action Areas detailed in the CGIAR 2030 Research and Innovation Strategy: Systems Transformation, Resilient Agrifood Systems, and Genetic Innovation. Each Initiative is placed under a primary Action Area, yet most Initiatives involve collaboration across more than one Action Area.

== History ==
=== Early years (1971-1990) ===

CGIAR arose in response to the widespread concern in the mid-20th century that rapid increases in human populations would soon lead to widespread famine. Starting in 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government laid the seeds for the Green Revolution when they established the Office of Special Studies, which resulted in the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in 1960 and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in 1963 with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation. These centers work toward developing high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties that dramatically increased production of these staple cereals, and turned India, for example, from a country regularly facing starvation in the 1960s to a net exporter of cereals by the late-1970s.

But it was clear that the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations alone could not fund all the agricultural research and development efforts needed to feed the world&#x27;s population.

In 1969, the Pearson Commission on International Development urged the international community to undertake &quot;intensive international effort&quot; to support &quot;research specializing in food supplies and tropical agriculture&quot;.

In 1970, the Rockefeller Foundation proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat. This was further supported and developed by the World Bank, FAO and UNDP. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) was established on 19 May 1971, to coordinate international agricultural research efforts aimed at reducing poverty and achieving food security in developing countries.

Australian economist Sir John Crawford was appointed as the inaugural chair of the Technical Advisory Committee.

CGIAR originally supported four centers: CIMMYT, IRRI, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). The initial focus on the staple cereals—rice, wheat and maize—widened during the 1970s to include cassava, chickpea, sorghum, potato, millets and other food crops, and encompassed livestock, farming systems, the conservation of genetic resources, plant nutrition, water management, policy research, and services to national agricultural research centers in developing countries.

By 1983, there were 13 research centers around the world under its umbrella.

=== Expansion and consolidation (1991-2000) ===
By the 1990s the number of centers supported by CGIAR had grown to 18. Mergers between the two livestock centers the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) and the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA)) and the absorption of work on bananas and plantains into the program of the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI; now Bioversity International) reduced the number to 16. Later another center (ISNAR) was absorbed, reducing the total number of supported centers to 15.

The reduction in the number of supported centers was not enough to address problems facing the group. These included the logistics of funders and the group alike in dealing with a large number of centers. This led to the creation of three classes of centers, divided into high, medium, and low impact delivery.

At the same time, a number of aid recipient countries like China, India, and Malaysia created their own development agencies and developed cadres of agricultural scientists. Private donors and industries also contributed, while research institutions in the rich world turned their attention to problems of the poor. CGIAR, however, failed to embrace these changes in any effective way.

=== CGIAR reforms (2001-2007) ===
Seeking to increase its efficiency and build on its previous successes, CGIAR embarked on a program of reform in 2001. Key among the changes implemented was the adoption of Challenge Programs as a means of harnessing the strengths of the diverse centers to address major global or regional issues. Three Challenge Programs were established within the supported research centers and a fourth to FARA, a research forum in Africa:
* Water and Food, aimed at producing more food using less water; (Including Basin Focal Projects)
* HarvestPlus, to improve the micronutrient content of staple foods; and
* Generation, aimed at increasing the use of crop genetic resources to create a new generation of plants that meet farmers and consumers needs.

=== A new CGIAR (2008-2021) ===
In 2008, CGIAR embarked on a change process to improve the engagement between all stakeholders in international agricultural research for development—donors, researchers and beneficiaries—and to refocus the efforts of the centers on major global development challenges. A key objective was to integrate the work of the centers and their partners, avoiding fragmentation and duplication of effort.

CGIAR components during this time included the CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers, the CGIAR Fund, the CGIAR Independent Science and Partnership Council (ISPC) and partners. Research was guided by the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework. The CGIAR Consortium united the centers supported by CGIAR; it coordinated limited research activities of about 15 research projects (see list below) among the centers and provided donors with a single contact point to centers. The CGIAR Fund aimed to harmonize the efforts of donors to contribute to agricultural research for development, increased the funding available by reducing or eliminating duplication of effort among the centers and promoted greater financial stability. The CGIAR ISPC, appointed by the CGIAR Fund Council, provided advice to the funders of CGIAR, particularly in ensuring that CGIAR&#x27;s research programs are aligned with the Strategy and Results Framework. It provided a bridge between the funders and the CGIAR Consortium. The hope was that the Strategy and Results Framework would provide the strategic direction for the centers and CGIAR Research Programs, ensuring that they focus on delivering measurable results that contribute to achieving CGIAR objectives. However the research programs were designed prior to the Framework being ready, so now some refitting had to take place to get the programs inline with it.

====CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers====
The CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers was established in April 2010 to coordinate and support the work of the 15 international agricultural research centers supported by CGIAR. It played a central role in formulating the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework (SRF) that guided the work of CGIAR-supported centers on CGIAR funded research and developing CGIAR Research Programs under the SRF. The work of the CGIAR Consortium was governed by the Consortium Board, a 10-member panel that had fiduciary responsibility for CGIAR Research Programs, including monitoring and evaluation and reporting progress to donors. CGIAR Research Programs were approved and funded by the CGIAR Fund on a contractual basis through performance agreements.

==== Agri-Food Systems CGIAR Research Programs ====
Agri-Food Systems CGIAR Research Programs were multi-center, multi-partner initiatives built on three core principles: impact on CGIAR&#x27;s four system-level objectives; making the most of the centers&#x27; strengths; and strong and effective partnerships.

The following research programs comprised the CGIAR Research Portfolio of 2017-2021 (lead centers shown in brackets):

* FISH - Fish Agri-Food Systems (WorldFish)
* FTA - Forests, Trees, and Agroforestry (CIFOR)
*Grain Legumes and Dryland Cereals (ICRISAT)
*WHEAT - Global Alliance for Improving Food Security and the Livelihoods of the Resource-poor in the Developing World (CIMMYT)
*Livestock (ILRI)
*Maize (CIMMYT)
*Rice (IRRI)
* - (CIP)
Global Integrating Programs

Cross-cutting Global Integrating Programs framed to work closely with the Agri-Food Systems Programs within relevant agro-ecological systems. Four programs formed part of the 2017-2021 Portfolio.

* CCAFS - Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CIAT)
* A4NH - Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (IFPRI)
* PIM - Policies, Institutions, &amp; Markets (IFPRI)
* WLE - Water, Land and Ecosystems (IWMI)

Former programs

*GRiSP - A Global Rice Science Partnership (IRRI)
* Aquatic Agricultural Systems - Harnessing the Development Potential of Aquatic Agricultural Systems for the Poor and Vulnerable (WorldFish)
* More Meat, Milk and Fish by and for the poor (ILRI)
* Dryland Systems
* Humidtropics
* Grain Legumes (ICRISAT)

A new strategy and results framework was approved in 2015 and the portfolio of research programs revised. The systems programs dryland systems, aquatic agricultural systems, and Humidtropics ceased to be standalone programs, even though they were seen as what was new to the reformed CGIAR, but were not given a real chance to take off and prosper, mainly due to funding reductions, but also because of a refocus on commodity value chains. These commodity programs were renamed to, for example, RTB Systems Program or Rice Systems Program. Some work of the earlier systems programs were incorporated, but most was lost.

==== Research platforms ====
CGIAR supported four research platforms from 2017 to 2021:
* CGIAR Platform
* CGIAR 
* CGIAR 
*CGIAR GENDER (Gender Equality in Food Systems Research) Platform

== Impacts ==

The impacts of CGIAR research have been extensively assessed. Investments in CGIAR research generate returns of 10 times the amount invested.

Much of the impact of the CGIAR centers has come from crop genetic improvement. This includes the high-yielding wheat and rice varieties that were the foundation of the Green Revolution. An assessment of the impact of crop breeding efforts at CGIAR centers between 1965 and 1998 showed CGIAR involvement in 65 percent of the area planted to 10 crops addressed by CGIAR, specifically wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, barley, lentils, beans, cassava, and potatoes. Of this, 60 percent was sown with varieties with CGIAR ancestry (more than 90 percent in the case of lentils, beans, and cassava), and half of those varieties came from crosses made at a CGIAR center. The monetary value of CGIAR&#x27;s investment in crop improvement is considerable, running into the billions of dollars.

The centers have also contributed to such fields as improving the nutritional value of staple crops; pest and disease control through breeding resistant varieties; integrated pest management and biological control (e.g., control of the cassava mealybug in sub-Saharan Africa through release of a predatory wasp); improvements in livestock and fish production systems; genetic resources characterization and conservation; improved natural resource management; and contributions to improved policies in numerous areas, including forestry, fertilizer, milk marketing, and genetic resources conservation and use.

Further impacts of CGIAR include:

* Increased resilience, income and yield for 4.75 million farmers in India working across 3.7 million hectares by scaling CGIAR-developed natural resource management practices.
* Improved nutrition for 20 million people in low-income countries through increased access to critical nutrients via micronutrient-fortified crops with higher content of vitamin A, iron, and zinc.
* Increased rice yield by 0.6 to 1.8 ton per hectare and profitability by up to US$200 per hectare through use of a smart mobile crop management tool called &quot;RiceAdvice&quot; used in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
* For an annual investment of roughly US$30 million, the benefits gained from wheat research are in the range of US$2.2 billion to US$3.1 billion each year, from 1994 to 2014. For every $1 invested in wheat breeding, $73 to $103 were returned in direct benefits. Almost half the world&#x27;s wheat land is sown to varieties that come from research by CGIAR scientists and their global network of partners.
* The introduction of no-tillage systems in the rice-wheat systems in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, for example, generated economic benefits of about US$165 million between 1990 and 2010 from an investment of only US$3.5 million.
* A 2010 study projected that increased adoption of CGIAR-developed drought-tolerant maize varieties could increase harvests in 13 African countries by 10-34 percent, which could generate up to US$1.5 billion in benefits for producers and consumers.
* CGIAR has spent 20 percent of its expenditure on strengthening the capacity of national partners through formal and informal training and have trained over 80,000 professionals around the world.

<doc id="1116739" wikidata="Q233622" url="?curid=1116739" title="Wang Junxia">
<text>Wang Junxia (; born 19 January 1973) is a Chinese former long-distance runner who is the current world record holder at 3,000 meters. She also held the world record for the 10,000 meters for 23 years, between 1993 and 2016, which is a record in itself. Her best years were from 1991 to 1996. Wang was coached by Ma Junren until 1995 and by Mao Dezhen from 1995 to her retirement after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

==Early years==
Born in Jiaohe, Jilin, Wang beat Ethiopian Gete Wami to win the 1992 World Junior Championships in Athletics in 10,000 m (32:29.90) in Seoul, Korea.

==1993: Record-setting year==

In April 1993, Wang set a world-leading time and former Asian best in marathon (2:24:07). In May, she broke the Asian record of 3000 m in a fast time of 8:27.68 in the Chinese National Championships. In August, Chinese women distance runners under coach Ma Junren stunned the world and swept the world titles from 1500 m to 10,000 m in Stuttgart, Germany. Wang claimed the world title in 10,000 m (30:49.30), although she was sick before the race. In less than a month, she went on to win the 3000 m and 10,000 m in the Chinese National Games with three world records in three races.

On 8 September 1993, she won the 10,000 m final in a world record of 29:31.78, which bettered the former record by 42 seconds and was also the first-ever sub-30 minute performance in this event. The 10,000 record would remain on the books as the world record until the 2016 Olympics when it was smashed by Ethiopian Almaz Ayana.

On 11 September, she finished second in 1500 m behind her teammate, Qu Yunxia in another world record breaking race. Qu ran 3:50.46 (world record at the time) against Wang&#x27;s 3:51.92. Four years later, Bo Jiang and Yinglai Lang ran slightly faster than Wang in the same race. Qu&#x27;s record remained on the books until it was finally beaten by Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia when she ran 3:50.07 at the Herculis meet in Monaco on 15 July 2015. Wang is currently fifth on the all-time list.

In 3000 m heats on 12 September, Wang&#x27;s teammates broke the 3000 m world record in the first heat. This world record was just briefly held, when it was erased by Wang in the second heat. The next day she claimed the 3000 m in another record time 8:06.11. She also won the World Cup Marathon Championships later in the year.

In 1994, she was awarded the Jesse Owens prize on the remarkable performances in 1993. She was the first and only Chinese and Asian person to win the prize. Although she won the Asian Games in 10,000 m with a world-leading time (30:50.34) later in the year in Hiroshima, her world-record breaking form was obviously gone.

In 1995, Wang and her teammates broke up with their coach Ma due to prize money and his harsh coaching style. After a short period of training on their own without a major success, Wang started to train under coach Mao Dezhen to prepare for the 1996 Olympics. In Nanjing, she announced a comeback in the Olympics Trials, where she ran quality times in both 5000 m and 10,000 m.

==1996 Olympics==

At the 1996 Summer Olympics, Wang won the new Olympic event, women&#x27;s 5000 m (14:59.88) and a silver in the 10,000 m (31:02.58) just a second behind Portuguese Fernanda Ribeiro. Ribeiro made a heroic final lap kick that surprised Wang and perhaps because she was not used to being challenged, she was unable to react to it. In fact, not only did both women&#x27;s performances better the previous Olympic record in the 10,000 m, they ran it in such high temperatures that officials were handing out cups of water in the middle of the race, like a marathon. She retired after the Olympics and married Zhan Yu.

==After retirement==
&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2001 that Wang was living anonymously in Beijing. In 2008 Wang and her husband Huang Tianwen moved to Denver, Colorado. In 2012, she told the Spanish newspaper &quot;El Pais&quot; that she was writing her autobiography.

The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) listed Wang in its Hall of Fame. Wang was the only Chinese athlete to repeat her 1993 successes at the 1996 Olympics, under Coach Ma, though Qu had managed a bronze medal at the 1992 Olympics. However, there were doping allegations about her 1993 performances. Yuan Weimin, former Director General of the State General Administration of Sports and Chairperson of the Chinese Olympic Committee, had confirmed in 2009 in his book that six athletes coached by her former coach Ma Junren were dropped from the 2000 Summer Olympics because they were tested positive for doping. Coach Ma was also fired from the Chinese national team in 2000. During the 2012 Summer Olympics, a journalist even lumped Wang and compatriot Qu Yunxia into a group of so-called &quot;chemical sisters&quot;.

On 3 February 2016, Tencent Sports exclusively published a March 1995 letter reportedly from Wang and nine other athletes under Ma&#x27;s tutelage. In it, they alleged Coach Ma forced them to dope. Zhao Yu, the investigative author who had received the letter, said Wang and others came forward because Coach Ma had told them to take personal responsibilities, should they get caught. The letter was initially published in 2015 in Zhao&#x27;s book, but only gained traction in February 2016. The story raised suspicion over the legitimacy of Wang&#x27;s world records. The IAAF confirmed it had reached out to the Chinese Athletics Association for verification and would investigate, but the latter has yet to respond. The IAAF was expected to discuss a proposal to wipe all pre-2005 world records in August 2017, due to it having only stored blood and urine samples since 2005.

<doc id="1116742" wikidata="Q930543" url="?curid=1116742" title="Waiau Toa / Clarence River">
<text>The Clarence River (; officially Waiau Toa / Clarence River) is a major river which flows through the Kaikōura Ranges in the northeast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. At roughly long, it is the longest river in Canterbury and the eighth longest in New Zealand.

For its first , the river runs in a generally southeastern direction. It then turns northeast, running down a long straight valley between the Inland and Seaward Kaikōura Ranges. At the end of the Seaward Kaikōuras, the river meanders through undulating hill country before draining into the Pacific Ocean near the town of Clarence. A large part of the river is within the boundaries of Molesworth Station.

The river and its tributaries cut through rock formed on the seafloor of the Pacific during the late Cretaceous through to the middle Eocene, during which period the majority of New Zealand was at points almost entirely submerged. This provides a useful record of this time period, and has contributed to our understanding of several events which took place during that era. The area also provides valuable insight into more recent geological events, having been heavily affected by the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake.

==History and name==
The area around Waiau Toa has a long history of pre-European habitation and was once one of the most populated areas of the island, with multiple iwi having ties to the region. While archaeological evidence on the northern side of the river, such as a series of middens, suggests early habitation in the area by the Waitaha iwi, the earliest concrete evidence of permanent Māori habitation relates to a Kāti Māmoe pā at Waipapa on the southern side of the river mouth. A raid on the settlement at Waipapa by Rangitāne proved instrumental in expanding Māori settlement of the region, as a subsequent attack on Rangitāne by Ngāti Kurī led to the latter returning captives and marrying into the area. Following a breakdown of the relationship between Ngāti Mamoe and Ngāti Kurī, Waipapa was occupied by Ngāti Kurī, driving Ngāti Mamoe from the area and giving Ngāti Kurī mana whenua over the region to this day. Further settlements were then established in the area, including at the mouth of the Waiau Toa near a waka landing site.

The frequency with which the iwi local to Waiau Toa changed is partially related to its importance as a (food gathering place). The area traditionally provided a wide variety of food sources, including birds (such as kererū, tūī, and tītī), plants (such as harakeke, raupō, and kiekie), and seafood (such as pāua, kina and pipi). The river&#x27;s floodplains provided ample fertile soil for the development of gardens, with a large agricultural community developing around the area&#x27;s many pā farming crops including kūmara, which typically would not be able to grow so far south.

The Māori name for the river, Waiau Toa, points to a legend regarding this river and the nearby Waiau Uwha River. Both of these rivers have their sources on either side of the St James Range, separated by roughly , before flowing in different directions and ending apart at their mouths. According to legend, the Waiau Toa and Waiau Uwha were lovers who for reasons unknown were turned into their respective rivers, with the increased flow from snow melt said to represent their weeping from being separated.

The origins of the European name for the river are unclear. The name &#x27;Clarence River&#x27; first appears on an 1856 chart of the region alongside the Māori name, however this is believed to be a recording of an earlier name in honour of King William IV, who was the Duke of Clarence prior to his ascension to the throne potentially by local politician and premier Frederick Weld. The European and Māori names for the river have been used interchangeably for much of the river&#x27;s history following European settlement, and in 2018 the river was officially gazetted as Waiau Toa / Clarence River, becoming one of many New Zealand places to have a dual name.

==Geography==
The Clarence River begins near Clarence Pass in the Spenser Mountains, just beyond the northern end of the Southern Alps. The upper river flows through Lake Tennyson before joining up with Princess Stream and Serpentine Creek and flowing south for roughly towards Hanmer Springs. Upon reaching the Hanmer Range, the river turns and flows east for and north for a further , taking the river towards Molesworth Station and its confluence with the Acheron River. From here, the Clarence enters a long, straight valley where it separates the Inland and Seaward Kaikōura Ranges, flowing roughly parallel to the coastline and Awatere River. This portion is popular with packrafters for the variety and remoteness it offers.

Towards the northern end of the Seaward Kaikōuras, the river turns towards the coast through a gorge historically known as the Sawtooth Gorge before opening to a narrow coastal plain. It then meanders back to the southwest along the eastern flank of the Seaward Kaikōuras as a braided river for around before turning once more to the southeast and emptying into the Pacific Ocean. In total, the river has a length of roughly , making it the 8th longest river in New Zealand.

Northern tributaries along the middle segment of the Clarence River (e.g., Mead Stream, Dee Stream, Branch Stream, Muzzle Stream) cut through an uplifted, folded and rotated block of limestone and marl that accumulated on the seafloor from the late Cretaceous through the Paleocene and middle Eocene (75–45 million years ago). Exposures of this limestone—the Amuri Limestone—provide some of the most complete records for this time interval of Earth&#x27;s history. They have provided important insights to our understanding of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM-2), and other Paleogene hyperthermal events.

The geography of the Clarence is also affected by New Zealand&#x27;s frequent earthquakes. In the aftermath of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, a slip blocked the Clarence River from its mouth, causing a buildup of water behind it. Due to the risk of flash flooding downstream, residents below the slip were evacuated. The river broke through the debris 16 hours after it occurred.

<doc id="1116767" wikidata="Q2609772" url="?curid=1116767" title="Blackball, New Zealand">
<text>Blackball is a small town on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, approximately 29 km from Greymouth. Elevation is approximately 100 metres.

Blackball was a centre of New Zealand radicalism and workers&#x27; militancy. It is credited as the birthplace of (the predecessors of) the New Zealand Labour Party, which followed the 1908 miners &#x27;cribtime&#x27; strike, at ten weeks the longest in New Zealand history. In the 1913 Great Strike, Blackball miners were the last to return to work, in 1914. During the strike they had picketed miners in nearby Brunner and had burnt down the secretary of the &#x27;arbitration&#x27; (strikebreaker) union&#x27;s home. In 1925 the headquarters of the Communist Party of New Zealand moved to Blackball from Wellington. The pit closed in 1964.

==History==
The gold rush in the Moonlight district in 1864–65 heralded the birth of Blackball. In November 1865, a gold nugget was found in what was later called Blackball Creek but it was not until 1866 that gold in payable quantities was found in upper Blackball Creek. At the time, this area was known as Garden Gully but as gold continued to be found, it became known as Croesus.

Blackball was founded in 1893 following the establishment of a nearby mine. The town was named after the Black Ball Shipping Line, which leased land in the area to mine for coal.

As the number of gold miners continued to increase, the difficulties of supplying them with food multiplied. The Plateau (later to be known as Blackball) was used as an over-night stop in the two-day journey from Greymouth. Huts and small store sheds gradually formed a small township which became known as Blackball.

Blackball Workingmen&#x27;s Club is one of the few old community organisations left in the town. Both the Oddfellows Lodge and the Buffaloes Lodge closed long ago. In its heyday Blackball had a Lodge of the Oddfellows Order. The Oddfellows Lodge played a major role in community life offering financial aid and self-improvement in the age before TV and State Social Security. The Oddfellows Hall was a major centre of community activity and social life.

The Blackball lodge of the United Ancient Order of Druids was formed originally in 1906 and like most other organisations of its day has ceased to exist in Blackball.

On 7 June 1941 the Blackball Lodge No 80 of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes was opened In the Oddfellows Lodge Hall by the Provincial Grand Primo of the West Coast Bro. T.J.Preston KoM. The founders of the lodge were Bro. T.Durkin C.P. and Bro. T Nicolson C.P. both of whom would cycle 35 miles every fortnight just to attend lodge meetings of Blackball Lodge and thus fulfill their duties as Founders. The first officers of the Blackball Lodge No 80 were Bro. Durkin C.P.(Worthy Primo) Bro. Nicholson C.P. (Alderman of Benevolence) Bro. R. Cooke (City Chamberlain) Bro. J Moore (City Marshall) Bro. Reid (City Tyler) Bro. R Duggan (City Registrar) Bro. R Mountford (City Constable) Bro. A Ross (City Waiter) Bro. Johnston (City Minstrel) Bro. J Barry (City Treasurer) and Bro. M O&#x27;Flaherty (City Secretary)

By 1964 the mine had closed.

Since 2018 a community-led programme has been restoring Blackball&#x27;s heritage.The programme has received $1.9 million from the Department of Internal Affairs to help carry out this work. This involved the restoration of a coal mine chimney and a aerial ropeway used to transport coal.

==Demographics==
Blackball is defined by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. Blackball is part of the larger Barrytown statistical area.
Blackball had a population of 273 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 3 people (−1.1%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 42 people (−13.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 138 households, comprising 153 males and 126 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.21 males per female, with 33 people (12.1%) aged under 15 years, 45 (16.5%) aged 15 to 29, 153 (56.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 51 (18.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 94.5% European/Pākehā, 12.1% Māori, 1.1% Pasifika, 2.2% Asian, and 2.2% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 64.8% had no religion, 18.7% were Christian and 5.5% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 12 (5.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 72 (30.0%) people had no formal qualifications. 18 people (7.5%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 99 (41.2%) people were employed full-time, 39 (16.2%) were part-time, and 21 (8.8%) were unemployed.

== Railway ==

Blackball was the terminus of the New Zealand Railways Department&#x27;s Blackball Branch, a branch line from the Stillwater–Westport Line. The line was approved in 1901, construction began in 1902 under the auspices of the Public Works Department, trains first ran in 1909, and it was officially opened on 1 August 1910. Private interests constructed a steep extension from Blackball into the Paparoa Ranges that employed the Fell mountain railway system to aid braking. This extension was later taken over by the State Mines Department and was known as the Roa Incline.

Passenger services operated to Blackball until 1940, primarily for the benefit of miners. Coal was the mainstay of the railway, and when tonnages dropped to an unsustainable level the Roa Incline closed on 25 July 1960. Trains to Blackball became increasingly infrequent, and when a flood destroyed two spans of the line&#x27;s bridge over the Grey River on 21 February 1966, the Railways Department viewed repairs as unjustifiably expensive and closed the line. Blackball&#x27;s station building had been destroyed by fire in 1955.

==Notable places==
Blackball is home to five historic places registered with Heritage New Zealand: The Blackball coal mine chimneys, registered as category 1; the Blackball mine return air vent and fan chamber, registered as category 1; Formerly The Blackball Hilton, a hotel which changed its name from The Blackbill Hilton following threats of legal action from the Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts company, registered as category 2; the Blackball Community Centre, registered as category 2; and the Miners Bath House, registered as category 2.

The Blackball Museum of Working Class History opened in the town on 1 May 2010, in order to &quot;celebrate the role working people have played in creating the infrastructure and wealth of a nation, [and] the part working people have played in creating society&quot;.

== Literature ==

Blackball has a unique literary inheritance: for a small town, it has managed to attract more than its share of literary representations. Bill Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Coal Flat&quot; (1963) is a major New Zealand novel in the dated social realist tradition. Pearson had taught in the town as a probationary teacher in 1942, and had formed a friendship with the publican&#x27;s family. His book caused some consternation amongst the local people, as they tried to &quot;spot the character&quot; and identify who Pearson had based his characters on. Pearson died in 2002.

Eric Beardsley&#x27;s &quot;Blackball &#x27;08&quot; is an historical novel published in 1984. Beardsley used the historic 1908 Crib Time strike as the basis for a story that fleshed out the drama of what was a key moment in New Zealand trade union history. He published his biography &quot;Sliding down the Hypotenuse&quot; in 2011.

Jeffrey Paparoa Holman wrote &quot;The Late Great Blackball Bridge Sonnets&quot;, a collection of poetry published in 2004, which contains poems based around the railway bridge that linked the community with the outside world. The poems also mention people and features of the town, which Holman recalls from his childhood in Blackball during the 1950s and 1960s.

Paul Maunder, who lives in the town, is a playwright who has written and staged a number of plays about the town and working-class history.

Stevan Eldred-Grigg, who spent the first six years of his life in the town and now lives there once more, is a novelist and historian who has recently published a memoir about family life in 1950s Blackball.

<text>Sir William Richard Shaboe Doll (28 October 1912 – 24 July 2005) was a British physician who became an epidemiologist in the mid-20th century and made important contributions to that discipline. He was a pioneer in research linking smoking to health problems. With Ernst Wynder, Bradford Hill and Evarts Graham, he was credited with being the first to prove that smoking increased the risk of :lung cancer and :heart disease. (German studies had suggested a link as early as the 1920s but were forgotten or ignored until the 1990s.)

He also carried out pioneering work on the relationship between radiation and leukaemia as well as that between asbestos and lung cancer, and alcohol and breast cancer. He however, initially for many years, stood in opposition to research done by Alice Stewart which connected radiation exposure of pregnant mothers to development of leukaemia in their children due to her &#x27;questionable&#x27; analysis. On 28 June 2012, he was the subject of an episode of &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot;, a series broadcast on BBC Radio Four to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, dealing with 60 public figures from her reign.

==Biography==
Doll was born at Hampton, Middlesex (now part of south-west London) into an affluent family, though his father&#x27;s work as a doctor was cut short by multiple sclerosis. Educated first at Westminster School, Doll originally intended (against the wishes of his parents that he become a doctor like his father) to study mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge. Doll later recalled he failed the final of four examinations for a college scholarship through having drunk three pints of the College&#x27;s 8% alcohol own-brewed beer the night before. He was offered an exhibition instead, but refused to take it up.

He chose instead to follow his parents&#x27; wishes and study medicine at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School (since merged into King&#x27;s College London) from where he graduated in 1937. Doll was a socialist, and one of the significant figures in the Socialist Medical Association whose campaign helped lead to the creation of Britain&#x27;s postwar National Health Service. He joined the Royal College of Physicians after the outbreak of World War II and served for much of the war as a part of the Royal Army Medical Corps on a hospital ship as a medical specialist.

After the war, Doll returned to St Thomas&#x27;s to research asthma. In 1948 he joined a research team under Dr Francis Avery-Jones at the Central Middlesex Hospital, run under the auspices of the statistical research unit of the Medical Research Council. Over a 21-year career in the unit, Doll rose to become its director. His research there initially focused on the role of occupational factors in causing peptic ulcers.

In 1950, he undertook, with Austin Bradford Hill, a study of lung cancer patients in twenty London hospitals, at first under the belief that it was due to the new material tarmac, or motor car fumes, but rapidly discovering that tobacco smoking was the only factor they had in common. Doll himself stopped smoking as a result of his findings, published in the British Medical Journal in 1950, which concluded:
Four years later, in 1954, the British doctors study, a study of some 40,000 doctors over 20 years, confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related. In 1955, Doll reported a case-controlled study that firmly established the relationship between asbestos and lung cancer.

In 1966, Doll was elected to the Royal Society. The citation stated:
In 1969, Doll moved to Oxford University, to sit as the Regius Professor of Medicine, succeeding the clinical researcher Sir George Pickering. Initially, epidemiology was held in low regard, but in his time at Oxford he helped reverse this. He was the primary agent behind the creation of Green College, which was founded in 1979. Doll was appointed the first Warden of Green College, whence he retired in 1983. Green College merged with Templeton College in 2008 to become Green Templeton College, which is located on the site that was previously Green College.

Doll also helped found the National Blood Service, and was key in avoiding a system of paying donors for their blood, as had been adopted in the United States. His continued work into carcinogens at the Imperial Cancer Research Centre at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, working as part of the Clinical Trial Service Unit, notably including a study undertaken with Richard Peto, in which it was estimated that tobacco, along with infections and diet, caused three-quarters of all cancers, which was the basis of any of the World Health Organization&#x27;s conclusions on environmental pollution and cancer.

Doll was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1966, knighted in 1971, and awarded the Edward Jenner Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1981. Also in 1981, Doll became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1976.

In 1996, he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) for &quot;services of national importance&quot;. International honours included the Presidential Award of the New York Academy of Sciences as well as a United Nations Award for his research into cancer. In April 2005, he was awarded the Saudi Arabian King Faisal International Prize for medicine jointly with Peto for their work on diseases related to smoking. In 2004, he was awarded the inaugural Shaw Prize for Life Sciences and Medicine for his contribution to modern cancer epidemiology. He was also awarded honorary degrees by thirteen different universities.

He was a supporter of the Liberal Democrats at the 2005 general election.

==Death==
He died on 24 July 2005, at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after a short illness.

On 7 June 2015, a blue plaque was unveiled at his home at 12 Rawlinson Road.

He was an atheist.

==Building==
The Richard Doll Building in Headington, east Oxford, designed by Nicholas Hare Architects in 2006, was named in his honour and opened shortly before his death.
It houses the Clinical Trial Service Unit,
Cancer Epidemiology Unit and National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit. The building received an RIBA Award in 2007.
A plaque inside the building contains the following quotation from Doll:

One of the buildings of the Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, London is also named after Sir Richard Doll.

==Research funding==
After Richard Doll&#x27;s death, some controversy arose over aspects of his research funding when his papers, held at the Wellcome Library, indicated that for many years he had received consultancy payments from chemical companies whose products he was to defend in court.

These include US$1,500 per day consultancy fee from the Monsanto Company for a relationship which began in 1976 and continued until 2002. During this period Doll wrote to a Royal Commission in Australia investigating whether the Monsanto-produced herbicide Agent Orange, which was used during the Vietnam War, was carcinogenic, claiming that there was no evidence that it caused cancer.

He also received £15,000 from the Chemical Manufacturers Association, Dow Chemicals, and ICI for a review published in 1988 that concluded that workplace exposure to vinyl chloride did not increase the chance of contracting cancer, with the exception of angiosarcoma of the liver, contradicting two previous reviews by the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer.

Some donations, including a £50,000 gift from asbestos company Turner and Newall, were given in a public ceremony to Green College, Oxford, but most fees and payments remained undisclosed to the public, Oxford University and colleagues until his death. His defenders point out that his connections to industry were widely known by those in the field, that he did his work before formal disclosure of commercial interests became commonplace and that on occasion, he came to conclusions that were unpalatable to the companies who consulted him. His own view, as reported by Richard Peto – who criticised the allegations, claiming they originated with people aiming to damage Doll&#x27;s reputation – was that it was necessary to co-operate with companies for access to data which could prove their products to be dangerous. Peto said also that Doll gave all his fees from such work to Green College, Oxford, which he had founded.

Some controversy arose over the fact that he did not publish a paper on &#x27;A tentative estimate of the leukaemogenic effects of test thermonuclear explosions&#x27; in the &quot;Journal of Radiation Protection&quot; in 1955 which stated that &#x27;there is no threshold [radiation] dose below which no effect is produced&#x27; in humans. He withdrew it on advice from Sir Harold Himsworth, Secretary of the MRC (Medical Research Council), who in turn was advised by the Atomic Energy Authority not to publish because it would be contrary to their interests. It was only published in 1996 when this kind of view was more acceptable view to the nuclear industry.

<doc id="1116778" wikidata="Q726841" url="?curid=1116778" title="Gary Anderson (placekicker)">
<text>Gary Allan Anderson (born 16 July 1959) is a South African former professional American football placekicker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 23 seasons. The first South African to appear in an NFL regular season game, he spent the majority of his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers and is also known for his Minnesota Vikings tenure. Anderson earned four Pro Bowl and two first-team All-Pro honors after joining the league in 1982 and was named to the NFL&#x27;s second All-Decade teams of the 1980s and 1990s, as well as the Steelers All-Time Team.

With the Vikings in 1998, Anderson became the first NFL kicker to convert every field goal and extra point in the regular season. During the postseason, however, he missed a critical field goal in the 1998 NFC Championship Game, which is often attributed with the Vikings&#x27; defeat. Anderson continued his NFL career for six more seasons until retiring in 2004. He ranks third in games played (353), points scored (2,434), and field goals made (538) and is also the Steelers&#x27; all-time leading scorer at 1,343 points.

==Early life==
Gary Anderson was born in Parys, South Africa and grew up in Durban. His father, the Reverend Douglas Anderson, played professional soccer in England. His mother was South African. Shortly after Gary graduated from high school at Brettonwood High, Reverend Anderson left South Africa and moved his family to the United States.

Gary Anderson had hoped to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and become a professional soccer player in Europe. On his third day after immigrating to the United States, Gary Anderson had been given a few American footballs to kick. He went to a local high school football field in Downingtown, Pennsylvania to see what kicking this type of ball was like. Gary Anderson grew up playing rugby and was drop-kicking them from the 50-yard line. A high school football coach and friend of Dick Vermeil watched Gary Anderson and arranged a tryout with the Philadelphia Eagles the next day. Gary Anderson was aged only 18, having just graduated high school, so at the tryout there were university scouts present, all four of whom offered scholarships to Gary Anderson on the spot. Anderson chose Syracuse after they promised him that he would also be able to play on the school&#x27;s soccer team. He played for the Syracuse soccer team in 1978 and 1979, scoring nineteen goals, before devoting himself to football his junior and senior seasons.

==Professional career==

After graduating from Syracuse University, he was drafted as a placekicker by the Buffalo Bills in the 1982 NFL draft but was cut before the season began. He then, within a few days, signed as a free agent with the Pittsburgh Steelers and spent the following 13 seasons in Pittsburgh. For the 1995 and 1996 seasons, Anderson signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles. He then spent the 1997 season as a member of the San Francisco 49ers.

He also had the distinction of wearing a one-bar facemask throughout his career, even though the NFL outlawed their use prior to his final season in 2004 – he, along with Arizona Cardinals punter Scott Player, were afforded a grandfather clause.

In 1998, Anderson signed with the Minnesota Vikings and converted all 35 of his attempted field goals and all 59 extra points in regular season play, becoming the first placekicker to finish the regular season with a 100% success rate on both field goals and extra points. His only miss of the season came in the 1998 NFC Championship Game against the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons ending up winning the game in overtime sending them to Super Bowl XXXIII. Anderson continued to play for the Vikings until 2002. In 2000, while with the Vikings, Anderson surpassed the legendary George Blanda to become the NFL&#x27;s All-Time Leading Scorer and held the record upon his retirement from the NFL in 2004. Anderson played his final two seasons with the Tennessee Titans in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Anderson played 23 years in the NFL; only Adam Vinatieri (24 seasons), Morten Andersen (25 seasons) and George Blanda (26 seasons) have had longer playing tenures; Additionally, Vinatieri and Andersen are the only players to play in more career games than Anderson. Although not officially retired, Anderson&#x27;s number 1 has also not been reissued by Steelers since his departure from the team.

There are a number of interesting coincidences between Anderson and Morten Andersen, another retired star placekicker. Anderson and Morten Andersen have nearly identical last names, were born within a year of one another outside the United States (Morten was born in Denmark), came to the United States as teenagers, were both drafted in 1982, had long and successful NFL careers throughout the 1980s and 1990s (and both retiring in the 2000s decade), and hold first or second place in a number of NFL records for scoring, field goals, and longevity. Their overall accuracy is also nearly identical; their career percentage being within .5% of each other on both FGs and PATs. In the 1998 NFC Championship Game, Anderson missed a field goal for the Minnesota Vikings before Morten Andersen successfully converted his winning kick for the Atlanta Falcons (which sent them to Super Bowl XXXIII, their first Super Bowl appearance), both from the same distance as well (38 yards). On 16 December 2006, Morten passed Anderson to become the all-time leading scorer in NFL history. The following weekend, 24 December 2006, Morten again passed Anderson to become the NFL&#x27;s career leader in field goals made.

==Retirement==
Anderson stayed with the Vikings until the 2002 season, then he joined the Tennessee Titans as a replacement for the injured Joe Nedney. Anderson connected on 27 of 31 field goal attempts in the regular season despite rotating periodically with punter Craig Hentrich, who booted four of five FGAs. In Tennessee&#x27;s playoff win over Baltimore, Anderson connected on the winning 46-yard field goal in the final seconds, while in Tennessee&#x27;s playoff loss to New England he missed on his one attempt.

After that season, Anderson was making plans to retire and turned down offers from several teams to come kick for them. In June 2004, Anderson, his wife, Kay, and sons Austin and Douglas moved to the Canadian Rocky Mountain town of Canmore, Alberta, Canada, just outside Banff National Park. When Nedney went down with another season-ending injury after the start of the 2004 season, Anderson again agreed to kick for the Titans, commuting from Canada each week. At the time of his retirement, Anderson was the last active player in the NFL to have played under former Steelers head coach Chuck Noll and the last remaining NFL player born in the 1950s.

Gary, and his wife, Kay, give back to their community and hosted an annual charity fundraiser called, &quot;Dreams for Teams&quot; in Canmore, Alberta with the mission of making a positive difference in the lives of Bow Valley school athletes, primarily through providing financial support, to assist them in becoming leaders, valuing teamwork, and achieving athletic and academic excellence. Each year the Anderson&#x27;s continue to give academic scholarships to local Canmore Athletes. Anderson coached the local boys high school soccer team in Canmore for over a decade. Anderson is passionate about fly fishing, and is a spokesman for the fly fishing industry.

<text>George S. Baker (born September 4, 1942) is a Canadian politician and former member of the Senate of Canada.

Baker was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1974 election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Gander—Twillingate, in Newfoundland and Labrador. He was re-elected in every subsequent election (representing Gander—Grand Falls after 1988) until his appointment to the Senate by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, in 2002.

Although a popular and articulate MP, he was hurt by the tradition of appointing no more than one Canadian Cabinet minister from Newfoundland at a time, and by his reputation as a maverick who said what he thought rather than what the party leadership would like him to say. Fred Mifflin&#x27;s and Brian Tobin&#x27;s appointments to cabinet following the 1993 election meant Baker had to remain on the backbench. Tobin&#x27;s resignation from the cabinet to become Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador opened the way for Baker to be appointed as Minister of Veterans Affairs. But when Prime Minister Chrétien lured Tobin back to Ottawa for the 2000 election, Baker was removed from Cabinet. He was appointed to the Senate in 2002.

On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Baker, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators refer to themselves as the Senate Liberal Caucus even though they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.

Baker retired from the Senate upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75 on September 4, 2017.

== Bloc Newfoundland controversy ==

In March 2009, as a Liberal Senator for Newfoundland and Labrador, he was the first among Newfoundland&#x27;s federal parliamentarians to overtly call for the foundation of a new sovereigntist party, based on the Bloc Québécois, largely in response to the $1.7 billion cuts in equalization payments that represented no less than 20% of the province&#x27;s budget, due to a change of how natural resources are factored in the calculation of equalization transfers.

This prompted a rebuke from the Prime Minister&#x27;s office and political commentators in Toronto and Ottawa. Some Conservative MPs demanded that Michael Ignatieff kick him out of the Liberal caucus, that he refused to do. However, this action caused little outcry in his home province.

<doc id="1116784" wikidata="Q129130" url="?curid=1116784" title="John Gray (American author)">
<text>John Gray (born December 28, 1951) is an American relationship counselor, lecturer, and author. In 1969, he began a nine-year association with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi before beginning his career as an author and personal relationship counselor. In 1992 he published the book &quot;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&quot;, which became a long-term best seller and formed the central theme of his subsequent books and career activities. His books have sold millions of copies.
==Early life and education==
His parents were both Christians and taught him Yoga and took him to visit Indian Saint Yogananda during his childhood. &quot;The Autobiography of A Yogi&quot; inspired him greatly later in life.

He received a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in the Science of Creative Intelligence, though sources vary on whether these degrees were received from either the non-accredited Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Switzerland or the accredited Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa.

Gray received an unaccredited (but state-approved) PhD in 1982 from Columbia Pacific University (CPU), a now-defunct distance learning institution. In 2002, he received an honorary doctorate from Governors State University in Illinois after he delivered their commencement address.

==Career==
In 1969, Gray attended a Transcendental Meditation lecture. He became a celibate and personal assistant to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi for nine years.

===Publications===
In 1992, Gray published &quot;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&quot;, which has sold more than 15 million copies and, according to a CNN report, it was the &quot;highest ranked work of non-fiction&quot; of the 1990s. The book has been published in more than 40 languages.

===Business ventures===
In 1997, Gray began opening Mars &amp; Venus Counseling Centers, where he trains therapists in his &quot;Mars &amp; Venus technique&quot; in exchange for a one-time licensing fee and monthly &quot;royalty payments&quot;. Dorothy Cantor, a former president of the American Psychological Association, has questioned the ethics of creating a franchise for what is essentially a therapeutic process.

In 1997, Gray began marketing his products through Genesis Intermedia, a company led by Ramy El-Batrawi. According to their SEC filing, &quot;A substantial portion of our product revenue has come from our Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus product series authored by John Gray, Ph.D.&quot; On December 31, 1997, Genesis sold 116,504 shares of its common stock to Dr. John Gray for $900,000. On November 1, 1998, 29,126 of those shares were surrendered. Royalties paid to Dr. Gray for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $0, $50,101, and $423,207, respectively. There were no royalties paid to Dr. Gray during the three months ended March 31, 1999 and 1998. in 2004, a massive class action lawsuit was filed against Genesis Intermedia for stock price manipulation. El-Batrawi settled with the SEC and was barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.

Gray has been marketing dietary supplements through his Web site since at least 2005. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered him to stop making illegal claims for several products: 2-AEP Membrane Complex, Ionic Silver Water, L-Glutathione, Liposomal DHA – Ultimate Omega-3 Brain Support, Liposomal Methyl B12/Folate, NAC N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine, and Vectomega.

Gray is also an early investor in YayYo, Inc, a rental car business for the ride-sharing industry operated by Ramy El-Batrawi. Gray owns 21.44% through his Gray Mars Venus Trust. Ramy El-Batrawi dies of undisclosed causes on April 23, 2024.

===Interviews and appearances===
Gray has made appeared on multiple talk shows, including &quot;Oprah&quot;, &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, and &quot;Larry King Live.&quot;

In a June 2014 interview with Agence France-Presse, Gray was quoted as saying with regard to feminism, &quot;The reason why there&#x27;s so much divorce is that feminism promotes independence in women. I&#x27;m very happy for women to find greater independence, but when you go too far in that direction, then who&#x27;s at home?&quot; He also stated that &quot;feminism in America holds back sales of [his] books&quot;, while other parts of the world - he cited Australia and Latin America notably - are more in tune with his basic message. With regard to online pornography Gray stated, &quot;With free internet porn, there&#x27;s a massive addiction happening,&quot; adding that there are &quot;just millions and millions of people... experiencing their sexual satisfactions through total fantasy. The effect that porn has on the brain is like taking heroin.&quot; With regard to the rise of infidelity sites like Ashley Madison and Arrangement Finders he states, &quot;When you have impersonal sex... &#x27;It&#x27;s OK, here are these cheating wives, men, they want to have sex with you&#x27;... So you go have sex with someone that you don&#x27;t know and someone you don&#x27;t love... impersonal sex does promote addiction to sex,&quot; he adds, &quot;it&#x27;s along the same line of pornography.&quot;

==Criticism==
In 2002, author Julia T. Wood published a critical response to Gray&#x27;s portrayals of men and women in &quot;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&quot;. In 2007 Deborah Cameron published a book-length critique of Gray, and other self-help ventures premised on gender difference stereotypes, in &quot;The Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages?&quot;

Gray was accused of borrowing from the work of author Deborah Tannen and he acknowledges some similarities but says, &quot;I was teaching those ideas before I&#x27;d heard of her&quot; and that he did not read her book. Other critics have accused Gray of limiting human psychology to stereotypes.

==Personal life==
Gray married self-help author Barbara De Angelis. They divorced in 1984. Gray married his second wife, Bonnie, in 1986; she died of cancer in 2018. Gray married his third wife, Wang Lin, also known as Viki Gray, on May 4, 2020 in Marin County, California. She was his personal guide during his speaking tours in China. 

Gray has a daughter and two stepdaughters. His youngest daughter Lauren markets the Mars Venus brand through her own videos on self-help relationship advice.

<text>Joaquim Nadal i Farreras (born 31 January 1948) is a Spanish politician and historian from Catalonia. He is a professor at the University of Girona and was the Minister of Territorial Policy and Public Works of the Catalan Government, the Generalitat de Catalunya, from December 2003 to December 2010.

== Years as mayor of Girona (1979-2002) ==

In 1979, he was the first mayor of Girona democratically elected after the Spanish transition, from the PSC). He resigned in 2002, in favour of his substitute Anna Pagans i Gruartmoner, also from the PSC. During his term of office as mayor of Girona, he launched the reform of the Barri Vell (1982), together with the promotion of the Call Jueu, the ancient Jewish neighbourhood. He also put into practice the widening and improvement of the social services’ infrastructures, bringing balance to the inequalities among neighbourhoods. As mayor of Girona, he also held the post of president of the Federation of Catalan Municipalities (1981–1985).

He was the PSC candidate for the presidency of the Generalitat in the 1995 elections for the Catalan Parliament, of which he was member from 1984 to 2012. He is the first secretary of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC) at Girona since 2008.

==Period in Catalan government (2003-2010)==
In the year 2003, he joined the government of Pasqual Maragall (PSC) as Councillor of Territorial Policy and Public Works, also serving as the Spokesman of the Catalan Government. He was considered the fourth-ranking member of the government. Nadal presided the Department of Territorial Policy and Public Works in 2005 during the crisis of El Carmel, when construction work to lengthen Barcelona Metro line 5 caused a building to collapse and forced the evacuation of 84 other buildings. Convergence and Union, then the opposition group in the Catalan Parliament, called on Nadal to resign, considering him the councillor responsible for the safety of public works projects, whereas the government blamed the opposition party for poor planning of the project during the last government of Jordi Pujol. As head of the department, Nadal promoted and approved the Catalan Plan for Transport Infrastructures to regulate all new road and railway infrastructures of Catalonia until 2026. The plan included a railway cross axis to link central Catalonia with the Lleida and Girona areas.

When the governing three-party coalition was broken by the removal of those councillors belonging to the Republican Left of Catalonia in May 2006, Nadal became Councillor of the Presidency, a position he held until the end of the legislature later that year. In November 2006, the newly elected President of the Generalitat, José Montilla, reappointed him Councillor of Territorial Policy and Public Works.

==Opposition leader==

Nadal became the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Catalonia in December 2012, upon constitution of the 9th Legislature, with Convergence and Union forming a minority government and the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia as the opposition party with the most seats. On September 3, 2012, the executive committee of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia decided to replace the party&#x27;s leadership in Parliament, including Nadal. He was also opposition leader from 1995 to 1999.

== Political thought ==

Among his political stances, he has shown his willingness to consider the granting immigrants the right to vote in municipal elections, which must be conceived, according to his own words, as a “limited ruled project”, “with the utmost rigor” but with a series of “cautions” as, for instance, that the only immigrants with right to vote should be those from countries with which a “reciprocity” agreement exists.

== Academic career and publications ==

Nadal has intermittently taught at the University of Liverpool (1970–1972), the Autonomous University of Barcelona (1972–1992) and the University of Girona (since 1992). His research work has been devoted to the 18th century in Catalonia, 19th-century Spanish economic history and local history, concentrating on various contributions to the history of Girona. Nadal did not run in the 2012 Catalan parliamentary election, announcing he planned to return to his teaching duties at the University of Girona.

Nadal has also published a number of books, such as:
* (1988)
* (1991)
* (1999)
* (2003)
* (2003)
* Responsible for the edition of the work by Emili Grahit i Papell, &quot;Memorias de un ex-alcalde gerundense&quot; (2003).

== Joaquim Nadal i Farreras Collection ==
PhD. Joaquim Nadal, first elected mayor of Girona since the end of the Spanish Civil War and holder of a chair in contemporary history at the University of Girona (UdG), made a gift to the UdG Library consisting of his personal library, located at the Girona Town Archive. The collection of around 1,600 books, mainly related to history and was collected throughout his career as a historian and professor, was presented on July 10 at the Gothic Room of the UdG Barri Vell Campus Library, and its cataloguing began in October of the same year.

This collection,  with those from Jaume Vicens Vives, Pierre Vilar, Joan Reglà, Jordi Nadal, Ramon Garrabou i Lluís Maria de Puig, confer the UdG a great significance as a center for historical research in Catalonia.

<text>Budapest were a melancholic post-grunge rock band from Leamington Spa, England.

==History==
The band were formed in 1999 by John Garrison (vocals, guitar) with Adrian Kelley (bass), Mark Walworth (guitar), Paul Possart (drums), and Chris Pemberton (piano, keyboards). After recording the material for their first album, &quot;Too Blind to Hear&quot;, Walworth committed suicide. Although shocked by this event, the remaining members of the band (Walworth being replaced by lead guitar Matt Parker later on) carried on with the release of the album, in tribute to their deceased partner. It appeared in September 2002 in UK, and was released in the United States in March 2004.

In 2003, the band played themselves in the two-part UK TV drama &quot;Final Demand&quot; for BBC One. The movie featured English actress Tamzin Outhwaite.

In August 2003, the band played at Festival Internacional de Benicàssim in Spain.

The follow-up 2005 album, &quot;Head Towards The Dawn&quot; (on which Garrison and Pemberton were the only remaining band players), was released in Spain only.

The band announced its end in the later part of 2006.

After the demise of the band, John Garrison embarked on to a solo career; Chris Pemberton has been playing keyboards with John Grant.

<doc id="1116788" wikidata="Q176578" url="?curid=1116788" title="Mikhail Borodin">
<text>Mikhail Markovich Gruzenberg, known by the alias Borodin (9 July 1884 – 29 May 1951), was a Bolshevik revolutionary and Communist International (Comintern) agent. He was an advisor to Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang (KMT) in China during the 1920s.

Born in a rural part of the Russian Empire (now Belarus), to a Jewish family, Borodin joined the General Jewish Labour Bund at age sixteen, and then the Bolsheviks in 1903. After being arrested for participating in revolutionary activities, Borodin fled to America, attended Valparaiso University, started a family, and later established an English school for Russian Jewish immigrants in Chicago. Upon the success of the October Revolution in 1917, Borodin returned to Russia, and served in various capacities in the new Soviet government. From 1919, he served as an agent of the Comintern, travelling to various countries to spread the Bolshevik revolutionary cause. In 1923, Vladimir Lenin picked Borodin to lead a Comintern mission to China, where he was tasked with aiding Sun Yat-sen and his Kuomintang. Following Sun&#x27;s death, Borodin assisted in the planning of the Northern Expedition, and later became an integral backer of the KMT leftist government in Wuhan.

Following a purge of communists from the Kuomintang, Borodin was forced to return to the Soviet Union in 1927, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He once again served in various positions within the Soviet government, and later helped found the English-language &quot;Moscow News&quot; newspaper, of which he would become the editor-in-chief. During the Second World War, he additionally served as editor-in-chief of the Soviet Information Bureau. Amidst rising antisemitism in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s, Borodin was arrested and deported to a prison camp. He died in 1951 and was officially rehabilitated in 1964.

==Early life==
Borodin was born Mikhail Markovich Gruzenberg () to a Jewish family in Yanovichi, Russian Empire, now part of Vitebsk Region, Belarus, on 9 July 1884. At a very young age, he began work as a boatman on the Western Dvina, traversing the stretch of the river between Vitebsk, Dvinsk, and Riga, now the capital of Latvia. He later moved to Riga, where he attended Russian-language night schools while working in the city&#x27;s port. He joined the General Jewish Labour Bund at age sixteen, switching allegiance to Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks in 1903. He became a close associate of Lenin, making use of his knowledge of the Yiddish, German, and Latvian languages in work as a Bolshevik agent in the empire&#x27;s northwest region. In mid-1904, he was ordered to travel to Switzerland to meet Lenin, who had gone into exile. Following the &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; massacre of unarmed protesters by Tsarist troops in Saint Petersburg on 9 January 1905, Borodin returned to Russia, organised revolutionary activity in Riga, and was later selected to attend the Bolshevik conference at Tampere, where he met Joseph Stalin.

In 1906, he attended the 4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in Stockholm. Later that year, he was picked up by the Tsarist police in Saint Petersburg, and given the choice of either being sent to Siberia or exile in Europe. Borodin chose exile, and by October, he had arrived in London, where police took notice of his activities and promptly ordered him out of the country. In 1907, he arrived in America, first to Boston, and then on to Chicago. While there, he attended classes at Valparaiso University in Indiana, taught English to immigrant children at Jane Addams&#x27; Hull House, and then opened his own school for Russian Jewish immigrants, which later grew into a successful business venture. During his time in the United States, Borodin associated nominally with the Socialist Party of America, whilst simultaneously promoting the Russian revolutionary cause in the immigrant community.

Following the October Revolution of 1917, he returned to Russia in July 1918, and began working in the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Republic. Some months later, he returned to America to relay Lenin&#x27;s &quot;Letter to American Workers&quot;, a propaganda message intended to counteract negative views of the Russian communists following the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. He also proposed a joint propaganda campaign with George Creel&#x27;s Committee on Public Information, though this never came to fruition. Having become disillusioned by the intensity of American criticism of the new Soviet government, Borodin gave up hope of co-operation with the Americans, and returned to Russia. He then moved on to Stockholm, where he met American writer Carl Sandburg, with whom he discussed the Bolshevik revolution.

In March 1919, Borodin participated in the first congress of the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow. After the congress, he embarked on his first Comintern assignment, travelling with a falsified Mexican diplomatic passport. Borodin travelled through a variety of European countries, deposited Soviet funds in a Swiss bank account, and otherwise tried to raise money to finance the establishment of communist parties in the Americas. He then travelled to Santo Domingo, from which he booked passage to New York, where he arrived in August 1919. His mission was known to the American authorities, and as such he was briefly detained by the Bureau of Investigation upon arrival. After his release, he went on to his former home, Chicago, where the Socialist Party of America was embroiled in a dispute between its left wing, who wanted to establish a communist party and join the Comintern, and the &quot;regulars&quot;, who were opposed. Borodin, conscious of the fact that his activities were being monitored, kept a low profile while in America, and on 4 October 1919, he slipped across the border into Mexico.

In Mexico, he met Indian revolutionary M. N. Roy, the American writers Carleton Beals and Michael Gold, and American communist Charles Phillips. Borodin taught Roy about the Russian Revolution and communism, and it was under Borodin&#x27;s influence that he took up communist beliefs. Together with the newly emboldened Roy, he helped establish the Mexican Communist Party. During his time in Mexico, Borodin sent reports of Roy&#x27;s exploits to Lenin, who subsequently invited him to attend the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern in Moscow, which would take place in July–August 1920. Leaving Mexico in December 1919, Borodin, Roy, and Phillips travelled to western Europe, where they intended to spread the communist cause in the lead up to the congress, specifically hoping to establish a communist party in Spain. Arriving in Moscow in the weeks before the congress, Borodin introduced Roy to Lenin, after which he went on to become a major figure in the Comintern.

Borodin later returned to Britain under the alias &quot;George Brown&quot;, where he was tasked with ascertaining the cause of the revolution&#x27;s failure there, and reorganising the British Communist Party. After several months of covert activities, he was jailed for six months on 29 August 1922 in Glasgow, ostensibly for breaking immigration regulations, though his political mission was known. He was then deported to Russia. Upon his arrival in Moscow, Lenin informed him that he had been chosen as the leader of a Comintern mission to China. He reached Beijing in the latter part of 1923, and arrived in Guangzhou, the seat of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s revolutionary government, on 6 October.
==China==
===Advisor to Sun Yat-sen (1924–1925)===
Following Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s request for help from the Comintern, Borodin was ordered to lead a contingent of Soviet advisors to Guangzhou, where Sun had established a revolutionary government in the aftermath of the Constitutional Protection Movement. Borodin understood no Chinese; English was to be the medium of discussion between the two. At this time, he was accompanied by Ho Chi Minh, the future Vietnamese communist leader, who then served as his secretary. Borodin was known for speaking with a clear midwestern American accent that offered no indication of his Russian origin, allowing him to easily communicate with the largely anglophone and American-educated leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT).

Greeted upon his arrival in Guangzhou by Eugene Chen, with whom he later became close, Borodin found that Sun&#x27;s government was teetering on the brink of collapse. Faced with rampant corruption, anti-Bolshevik feeling in parts of the KMT, and the ever-present threat of the warlords and the Beijing-based Beiyang government, Borodin was tasked with reforming the Kuomintang into a potent revolutionary force. Early in his time as an advisor, Borodin identified the KMT&#x27;s central weakness as its lack of mass support.

He negotiated the First United Front between Sun&#x27;s KMT and the nascent Chinese Communist Party (CCP), convincing that party, which consisted of only about 300 members at that time, that the alliance was in its long-term interest, as it would facilitate the organisation of both urban and rural workers. Under Borodin&#x27;s tutelage, both parties were reorganised on the Leninist principle of democratic centralism, and training institutes for mass organisation were established, such as the Peasant Training Institute, where the young Mao Zedong served. In May 1924, Borodin and his aides founded the Whampoa Military Academy, which trained officers for the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek. He arranged shipments of Soviet arms and shrewdly kept a balance between the middle-class elements of the KMT and the more radical CCP.

When the forces of rebel general Chen Jiongming threatened Sun&#x27;s base in Guangzhou in November 1923, Borodin proposed a mobilisation of the masses in defence of the city. To accomplish this, he suggested a promise of redistribution of landlord property to the local peasantry, an eight-hour working day for urban labourers, and a minimum wage. Sun rejected land reform because of strong opposition from some of his allies, though agreed to the proposals in principle, and offered a 25% rent reduction instead. In the event, Sun&#x27;s military forces were able to drive the rebels away, and the rent reduction proposal was never implemented.

In 1924, KMT leaders gradually grew weary of the influence of the Communist Party. When Borodin was confronted on this subject, he stated that continued Soviet aid was linked to co-operation with the communists. Leading figures in the CCP, including Mao Zedong, however, came to advocate an end to co-operation. Borodin made clear to them that their continued participation in the United Front was both necessary and expected. When a group of American supporters of the KMT attempted to warn Sun of the danger of the growing Soviet influence in his party, asking, in a subtle anti-semitic attack, whether Sun knew Borodin&#x27;s real name, Sun replied that it was &quot;Lafayette&quot;. In the latter part of 1924, Borodin travelled to meet the &quot;Christian General&quot; Feng Yuxiang, whom he attempted to bring into the Kuomintang fold. Feng and Borodin got along well, and although Feng did not join the KMT at this juncture, he did allow KMT propagandists and agitators to embed with his army, bolstering its cause.

===After Sun&#x27;s death: the Northern Expedition (1925–1927)===
After Sun&#x27;s death in 1925, the growth of a radical peasant and worker movement continued to be encouraged by the CCP, but was opposed by many in the KMT. The leftist wing of the KMT was strengthened by the Canton–Hong Kong strike, which broke out amidst anti-imperialist fervour after the British-run police force of the Shanghai International Settlement opened fire on Chinese protestors on 30 May 1925. Borodin wrote that: &quot;[the Canton–Hong Kong strike] was really not an economic strike. It was the quintessence of the anti-imperialist movement and the most militant expression of that movement. That it concentrated on Great Britain was not a matter of specific policy. Had it been Formosa or the Philippines it would have been directed against Japan or America. It was a political strike pure and simple&quot;.
Against this backdrop of rising leftist influence, in November 1925, a faction of anti-communist KMT members called the &quot;Western Hills Group&quot; met near Beijing, where they issued a declaration terminating Borodin&#x27;s relationship with the KMT, and expelling all communists from the party. This pronouncement had no effect, and Chiang Kai-shek wrote an open letter defending Borodin, the communists, and the KMT&#x27;s relationship with the Soviet Union.

The following year, however, Borodin gradually came into conflict with Chiang, who was vying for the position of Sun&#x27;s successor. Borodin initially opposed Chiang&#x27;s planned Northern Expedition to reunify China, and grew concerned about Chiang&#x27;s growing standing in the NRA. When Borodin went north in another attempt to bring Feng Yuxiang and his Guominjun into the Kuomintang in early 1926, Chiang began preparations to consolidate his position in Guangzhou. Borodin&#x27;s fears were then realised in March 1926, when Chiang launched the &quot;Canton Coup&quot; purge of hardline leftists who opposed the launch of the expedition.

Following the purge, Borodin returned from the north on Chiang&#x27;s request, began negotiations, and reached a narrow compromise to hold the First United Front together. On Joseph Stalin&#x27;s suggestion, Borodin agreed to continue Soviet aid to the KMT, and to support the Northern Expedition, which began in July 1926. At a Comintern conference in November 1926, Stalin explained his continued support for the KMT, saying that &quot;The exit of Chinese communists from the Kuomintang would be the gravest error&quot;, going on to argue that the CCP needed to work through the new government, forming a bridge between the state and the peasantry. Borodin agreed, noting that the purpose of the Northern Expedition was &quot;not the establishment of a proletarian state, but the creation of conditions which would give an impetus to the mass movement&quot;. In Borodin&#x27;s view, the goal of the China mission was to facilitate a bourgeois-democratic revolution led by an alliance of workers, peasants, petite bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie, so as to create the conditions necessary for a future proletarian revolution. With tensions between the left and right threatening to break into armed conflict in Guangzhou, Borodin became convinced that it was necessary to expand the base of the anti-imperialist movement, providing adequate space for both factions. For this reason, he had agreed to support the Northern Expedition.

Borodin and a group of Soviet military advisers led by Vasily Blyukher (known by the alias &quot;Galen&quot;) were responsible for planning the expedition. Whilst Chiang Kai-shek had been named commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army, he was not personally involved in the planning phase of the operation. Having studied the history of the mid-19th century Taiping Rebellion, Borodin decided that the expedition should head inland toward Hankou, an industrial and commercial centre with a large worker class, so as to avoid conflict with British and Japanese interests in the Shanghai area. As the expedition progressed, Borodin moved together with the KMT government from Guangzhou to Hankou, which was merged with two other cities to form Wuhan. Chiang, who refused to move his headquarters from Nanchang to Wuhan, gradually came into conflict with the leftist-dominated KMT government from December 1926, and Borodin publicly disavowed him the following month.

During his time in Wuhan, Borodin advocated a strategy of directing anti-imperialist feeling against Britain specifically, rather than other colonial powers such as America and France. A series of anti-British demonstrations carried out under Borodin&#x27;s advice in December 1926–January 1927 led to the occupation of the concessions at Hankou and Jiujiang by NRA troops, forcing the British to agree to their return to Chinese jurisdiction in an agreement negotiated by Eugene Chen.

In a startling turn of events, Borodin&#x27;s wife Fanya was captured by White Russian mercenaries employed by warlord Zhang Zongchang whilst travelling on board the ship &quot;Pamyat Lenina&quot; between Shanghai and Wuhan on 28 February 1927, after which she was held hostage in Jinan, Shandong. Borodin&#x27;s anxieties heightened even further in April 1927, when Chiang initiated a new purge of KMT leftists and communists, known as the &quot;Shanghai Massacre&quot;. Borodin and the communists gave their backing to the left-wing KMT government in Wuhan led by Wang Jingwei and Eugene Chen against Chiang&#x27;s rival Nanjing government. KMT attacks on communists and peasant leaders would continue, however, and even Wuhan army leader Tang Shengzhi&#x27;s forces harassed local communist groups, preventing their access to Wuhan&#x27;s armouries.

====Revelations in the Arcos Affair====
Borodin&#x27;s activities were brought into the British political limelight during the Arcos Affair of May 1927. Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin stated in parliament that his government had decrypted a telegram dated 12 November 1926 from the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to the Soviet envoy in Beijing. The telegram read:
According to Baldwin, this contradicted February 1927 statements by Soviet representatives in London to the effect that Borodin &quot;was a private citizen in service of the Chinese government&quot;, and &quot;that the Soviet government were not answerable for his actions&quot;. Baldwin declared that: &quot;The denials of any responsibility for Borodin&#x27;s actions...were therefore untrue and were made only in the hope of deceiving His Majesty&#x27;s Government and the British public while under their cloak Borodin was, in fact, carrying on his anti-foreign and anti-British activities as the authorised agent of the Soviet Government and by their orders&quot;. Borodin&#x27;s orchestration of anti-British demonstrations and his role in the occupation of the British concessions had brought him notoriety in London; his connection to Soviet government was made public in an attempt to justify the police raid on the All Russian Co-operative Society, and as a pretext for severance of diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union. Indeed, Britain cut ties later that May.

===Flight from China (1927)===
On 1 June 1927, Stalin sent a secret telegram to Borodin and M. N. Roy, who was also in Wuhan, ordering the mobilisation of an army of workers and peasants. The telegram was discussed at a meeting of the CCP politburo, where it was decried by both Borodin and CCP leaders as an impractical &quot;fairy tale from overseas&quot;. Borodin, who was more familiar with Stalin&#x27;s inner workings, interpreted the instructions as a ploy to relinquish blame for their inevitable failure, whilst Roy thought they signalled a long-awaited quickening of the Chinese revolution. Without consulting anyone, Roy decided to show the telegram to Wang, who was alarmed by its contents.

Instead of reassuring Wang, the revelation of the telegram&#x27;s message drove him to the right, upon which he decided to purge the communists from his administration and reconcile with Chiang Kai-shek. Borodin, along with all other Soviet representatives, was ordered to leave China in July 1927. He refused to leave, however, until his wife, still imprisoned in Jinan, was freed, and was in the meantime harboured by T. V. Soong in his family&#x27;s house. The Japanese, who considered Shandong within their sphere of influence, bribed a judge to release Fanya on 12 July. Formally seen off by the leaders of the Wuhan government, Mikhail left Wuhan by private train on 27 July. He was accompanied on his journey by Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s widow Soong Ching-ling, Eugene Chen&#x27;s son Percy Chen, and other Russian and Chinese revolutionary figures. &quot;The revolution extends to the Yangtze River&quot;, Borodin told a reporter as they began their journey, &quot;if a diver were sent down to the bottom of this yellow stream he would rise again with an armful of shattered hopes&quot;. He went on to say &quot;When the next Chinese general comes to Moscow and shouts &#x27;Hail to the world revolution&#x27;, better send at once for the GPU. All that any of them want is rifles&quot;. Whilst Fanya made her own way out of country, Borodin, with a bounty on his head, travelled first to Zhengzhou, where he was received by Feng Yuxiang, and then continued through Gansu and across Mongolia to Russia. Though they took different routes, both Mikhail and Fanya arrived in Moscow around the same time in October 1927.

==Later life==
Borodin and Roy were blamed for the failure of Stalin&#x27;s China strategy. Upon their arrival in Moscow, Roy was refused an audience with Stalin, and later fled the USSR with Borodin&#x27;s help. Borodin, on the other hand, was protected by Stalin, and worked a variety of jobs, including deputy director of the Soviet paper and lumber trust, factory inspector, and as a specialist dealing with immigrants from America at the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Labour. In 1931, he reconnected with Anna Louise Strong, with whom he had travelled during his trek out of China. Strong had earlier expressed the desire to start an English-language Soviet newspaper. With Borodin&#x27;s help, she founded the &quot;Moscow News&quot; in 1930. In 1932, Borodin became editor-in-chief of the newspaper. From 1941, he concurrently served as editor-in-chief of the Soviet Information Bureau.

In early 1949, following Strong&#x27;s attempts to publish a manuscript about the success of Maoism in China, and amidst an antisemitic fervour that had gripped the country following Israel&#x27;s turn away from the Soviet Union, Borodin and Strong were arrested and the paper shut down. Borodin died two years later on 29 May 1951 at a prison camp near Yakutsk. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1964.

==Family==
Borodin married Fanya Orluk, known as &quot;Fanny&quot;, and originally from Vilnius, in Chicago in 1908. He had two sons, Fred Borodin () and , both of whom were American-born. Fred, who rose to the rank of colonel in the Red Army, died during the Second World War, whilst Norman went on to be a Soviet journalist.

==Influence==
Borodin is one of the main characters in André Malraux&#x27;s 1928 novel &quot;Les Conquérants&quot;. He also appears in Kenneth Rexroth&#x27;s poem &quot;Another Early Morning Exercise&quot;.

<doc id="1116791" wikidata="Q6651" url="?curid=1116791" title="Brescia Calcio">
<text>Brescia Calcio, commonly referred to as Brescia (), is an Italian football club based in Brescia, Lombardy, that currently plays in Serie B, the second tier of Italian football.

The club holds the record for total number of seasons (64) and consecutive seasons (18, from 1947–48 to 1964–65) in Serie B, which they have won four times. Their best finish in Serie A came in the 2000–01 season when they placed eighth. At the beginning of the 21st century, led by the 1993 Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Roberto Baggio, the club also qualified for the Intertoto Cup twice, reaching the final in 2001 but being defeated on away goals by Paris Saint-Germain. During this era, Pep Guardiola, former FC Barcelona captain and later a highly decorated manager, and Andrea Pirlo, product of the Brescia Calcio&#x27;s young sector that won several trophies with AC Milan and Juventus in the next years, also played for the club.

The team&#x27;s colours are blue and white. Its stadium is the 19,550-seater Stadio Mario Rigamonti. They have a long-standing rivalry with Atalanta from nearby Bergamo.

==History==
The team was founded in 1911 as Brescia Football Club, joining the &quot;Terza Categoria&quot; division the same year. In 1913, Brescia was promoted to First Division for the first time, and from 1929 they played in Serie A for six of the seven following seasons. Successively, the club played among the two top divisions until 1982, when Brescia was relegated to Serie C. The club then returned to Serie B in 1985. Brescia played outside the two divisions of Lega Calcio (Serie A and B) only four years; under this aspect, only 11 clubs in all Italy marked a better performance.
Brescia won the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1994, the biggest achievement in their history to date. Brescia actually came to the footballing forefront only in 2000, when the previously unfancied club signed former FIFA World Player of the Year Roberto Baggio, who led Brescia to a seventh-place finish in the 2000–01 season, thus qualifying for the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Successively, Brescia reached the Intertoto Cup finals, then lost to Paris Saint-Germain via the away goals rule after achieving a 0–0 away draw in the first leg and a 1–1 home draw in the second leg. Baggio spent four years at Brescia before retiring in 2004 and during those historic four years, Brescia became widely known as &quot;Baggio&#x27;s Brescia&quot;. During Baggio&#x27;s four-year spell with Brescia, the club recorded its best-ever run of staying in Serie A. In the very next season that followed Baggio&#x27;s retirement (2004–05), however, Brescia were relegated from Serie A on the last day, finishing a lowly 19th. Brescia struggled for returning to top flight after the relegation and finally returned to Serie A after beating Torino with a 2–1 aggregate in the 2009–10 season. In the 2010–11 season, however, they were relegated back to Serie B. In the 2014–15 season, they were relegated to Lega Pro after finishing second from last. However, after Parma&#x27;s declaration of bankruptcy and demotion to Serie D, Brescia was among the teams selected to replace them in Serie B. A new promotion to Serie A was secured in the 2018–19 season, with two games to spare, but the team got relegated in the next season.

In addition to Roberto Baggio, one of the most decorated managers of all time, Mircea Lucescu, the Romanian Gheorghe Hagi, striker Luca Toni, Barcelona icon Pep Guardiola, Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali, Brescian striker Mario Balotelli, defender Mario Rigamonti and playmaker Andrea Pirlo–– which were born in the province of Brescia–– have also spent time playing for the club.

==Colours and badge==
===Colours and kit===
The first Brescia kit in 1911 was blue (the national colour) with a thick white vertical stripe down the middle, a design which has returned for the centenary season in 2011. The first appearance of a white &quot;V&quot; was in 1927; added so that the team could use &quot;Stadium&quot;, the newly built home of another team, Virtus. This style remained until 1940 when the &quot;V&quot; was removed and a plain blue shirt was used.

Some substantial changes after World War II saw the shirt become plain white with blue shorts. This was short-lived and, in 1954, the plain blue shirt returned. The white &quot;V&quot; also returned eventually in 1961 as a show of goodwill by the new chairman at the time.

The &quot;V&quot; disappeared again in 1969; replaced by a diagonal white sash, and returned, but much smaller, in 1974 for two years. The &quot;V&quot; was situated over the heart with the inclusion of the lioness, the symbol of the city of Brescia. The shirt remained plain blue until 1991, when the &quot;V&quot; returned and has been used ever since.

===Badge===
The first badge appeared on Brescia kits in the 1980s; a blue crest with a golden outline featuring a lion. The city of Brescia is known as &quot;Leonessa d&#x27;Italia&quot; (the Lioness of Italy) after ten days of popular uprising that took place in the city in the spring of 1849 against Austrian rule.

The crest was changed for the centenary of Brescia Calcio in 2011, featuring higher visibility, leaves, and a substantial redesign of the old logo.

The thick profile of the gold shield and laurel branches surrounding the badge are in pure celebration of achieving 100 years of age. The lettering has changed in favour of a font in the style of the period when the team was founded.

The Lion that, due to a misunderstanding of history, many believe to be a lioness (the definition of &quot;Leonessa d&#x27;Italia&quot; was assigned to Brescia following the uprisings, but the lion as a symbol of Brescia dates back to the Republic of Venice), has undergone a total redesign which aims to fix some errors in heraldic iconography (the absence of nails, muscle weakness and weak curvature of the tail) and to restore a more toned and ferocious looking lion, the symbol a football team should have.

==Seasons==
==Stadium==
The first ground at which football was played in Brescia was Campo Fiera, where the English workers at the Tempini plant played on their breaks.

In 1911, in the wake of enthusiasm following the foundation of the new club, it is thought a fenced ground was built shortly after on Via Milano.

In 1920 came the opening of the new ground on Via Cesare Lombroso, Brescia, which was used by the team until 1923. From 1923 until 1959, the team had moved into a more modern and larger facility located at Porta Venezia (then Via Naviglio), built for the town&#x27;s sports club Virtus and called &quot;Stadium&quot;.

It was in 1956 that the municipality had the idea to move the club to a stadium more suited to host the matches of the new Serie B.

They began the renovation and construction of the stands to the existing ground at Via Giovanni Novagani. This was completed in 1959 and Brescia began to play their home games in the new Mario Rigamonti stadium (named after the Torino player, Mario Rigamonti, who died in the Superga air disaster).

Over the years, the stadium has undergone several refurbishments (construction of roofing, press room, etc.), the most significant of which was in 2007 with the installation of new security measures.

<text>The Hoosac Range is a mountain range that forms the western edge of the northwest Berkshire Plateau of western Massachusetts, an extension of the southern Green Mountains of Vermont, which are part of the greater Appalachian Mountain chain. The mountains rise dramatically from the valleys of the Hoosic and North Hoosic rivers to the west, and the deep gorge of the upper Deerfield River valley to the east. The west branch of the Deerfield River defines the northern terminus of the range near Heartwellville, Vermont. The range features the Berkshires&#x27; high point, Crum Hill, which is located in the town of Monroe, Massachusetts.

The Hoosac Tunnel passes through the range.

<text>USS &quot;Bush&quot; (DD-166) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Bush&quot;, named for Lieutenant William Sharp Bush, USMC, was launched 27 October 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss Josephine T. Bush, a descendant of Lt. Bush; and commissioned 19 February 1919.

After her final acceptance trials in July 1919 &quot;Bush&quot; operated along the East Coast with Destroyer Squadron 3, Atlantic Fleet, until 29 November 1919 when she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, and became a unit of Squadron 1 Flotilla 7, in reduced commission. She was in reserve status until the summer of 1920. She then engaged in conducting training cruises for Naval Reserves. Thereafter, she exercised alternately at Charleston, her winter base, and at Newport, Rhode Island, her summer base, until placed out of commission 21 June 1922 at Philadelphia Navy Yard. &quot;Bush&quot; was sold 8 September 1936.

<doc id="1116804" wikidata="Q38826" url="?curid=1116804" title="Guard dog">
<text>A guard dog or watchdog (not to be confused with an attack dog) is a dog used to watch for and guard people or property against unwanted or unexpected human or animal intruders.

== History ==
The use of dogs as guardians is well known since ancient times. The Romans used to put mosaics (&quot;Cave canem&quot; mosaics) at the entrance of the houses to warn visitors and intruders of the presence of dangerous dogs at the property.

One of the first dog types used as guardians were the ancestral Mastiff-type landraces of the group known as Livestock guardian dogs which protected livestock against large predators such as wolves, bears and leopards. Orthrus is a famous example of a livestock guardian dog from the Greek mythology known for guarding Geryon&#x27;s red cattle.

Some ancient guard dogs in more urban areas, such as the extinct bandogges, were chained during the day and released at night to protect properties, camps and villages.

==Barking==

Both guard dogs and watchdogs bark loudly to alert their owners of an intruder&#x27;s presence and to scare away the intruder. The watchdog&#x27;s function ends here; a guard dog is then capable of attacking and/or restraining the intruder.

Livestock guardian dogs are often large enough——and strong enough to attack and drive away livestock predators. Some smaller breeds (such as Keeshonden and Tibetan Terriers) are excellent watchdogs, but not guard dogs, because they bark loudly to alert their masters of intruders, but are physically small and not given to assertive behavior. Guard dogs will bark to alert their master and to warn of an approaching animal or human threat prior to their interception of the trespasser. They are different from the smaller watchdogs in that they do not continue barking; they take action. Specifically, livestock guardian dogs such as the Kangal use loud alarm barks as a first line of defense against presumed threats; if these do not deter a perceived foe (either human or animal predators), other displays such as bluffing and charging are employed. For livestock guardians, proactive forms of defense such as bites are only used if all other forms of deterrence fail.

The following breeds are the best at watchdog barking:

* Doberman Pinscher
* German Shepherd Dog
* German Spitz (including Keeshond)
* Miniature Schnauzer
* Scottish Terrier
* West Highland White Terrier
If the risk is from human intruders, a suitable dog can be simply trained to be aggressive towards unrecognized humans and then tethered 
or enclosed unsupervised in an area that the owner wishes to protect when he is not around (such as at night); the stereotypical &quot;junkyard dog&quot; is a common example of this. If the purpose of the dog is to protect against human intruders after nightfall, a large, dark-colored dog in a dark house (lights off) would give the dog an advantage over the burglar.

It is claimed that female dogs tend to make better personal guardians than males, due to maternal instincts, but males are considered better for guarding property because of their greater territorial instinct. That may be true in general, but all dogs are individuals.

== Breeds ==
Many currently prominent guard dogs started as general purpose farm dogs, but gradually developed into guard breeds. Some dog breeds such as the Dobermann and the Dogue Brasileiro were specifically bred to guard.

Guard dogs are not restricted to mastiffs. Other dogs, like some shepherd dogs, Spitz dogs, cattle dogs and some catch dogs are also great guard dogs as well as being useful as multifunctional dogs, acting as attack dogs, personal protection dogs, police dogs, sport dogs such as schutzhund dogs, etc.

Guard dog breeds tend to be territorial, averse to strangers, dominant, and protective and loyal with family. The Fila Brasileiro for example has a reputation for being very intolerant of strangers and guests to the home and property. Other fierce guard dogs include breeds and landraces of the Ovtcharka type and other farm guard dogs such as the Boerboel.

Some breeds who make excellent guards are more commonly having breed specific legislation passed against them, banning them from some communities and whole countries.

==Legality==

The laws regarding ownership and usage of guard dogs vary from country to country. In England the main legislation relating to the use of guard dogs on commercial premises are contained within the 1975 Guard Dogs Act. The act specifies the requirements of kennels and the need to display guard dog warning signs at the entrance to sites.

<doc id="1116805" wikidata="Q1638113" url="?curid=1116805" title="Placekicker">
<text>In American football, the placekicker (PK), or simply kicker (K), is the player responsible for attempts at scoring field goals and extra points. In most cases, the placekicker also serves as the team&#x27;s kickoff specialist. The term derives from the attempted scorer kicking the ball &quot;from placement&quot; of a teammate holding the ball rather than by individually drop-kicking the ball through the goal posts.

==Specialized role ==
The kicker initially was not a specialized role. Before the 1934 standardization of the prolate spheroid shape of the ball, drop kicking was the prevalent method of kicking field goals and conversions, but even after its replacement by place kicking, until the 1960s the kicker almost always doubled at another position on the roster. George Blanda, Lou Groza, Frank Gifford and Paul Hornung are prominent examples of players who were stars at other positions as well as being known for their kicking abilities. When the one-platoon system was abolished in the 1940s, the era of &quot;two-way&quot; players gave way to increased specialization, teams would employ a specialist at the punter or kicker position. Ben Agajanian, who started his professional career in 1945, was the first confirmed place-kicking specialist in the NFL, kicking for ten teams. However, there is some evidence that Ken Strong and Phil Martinovich, both in 1939, and Mose Kelsch, in 1933 and 1934, may have preceded Agajanian as players who spent their seasons doing nothing but kicking.

Because of the difference in techniques needed, to avoid leg fatigue, and to reduce the risk of injury, on the professional level most teams employ separate players to handle the jobs. The placekicker usually will only punt when the punter is injured, and vice versa (one player often handles both jobs in the Canadian Football League, which has smaller active rosters than in the NFL). A professional team will occasionally even have a kickoff specialist who handles only the kickoffs and serves as a backup to the kicker who handles field goals and extra points. This is typically done to further protect a premier point-scoring kicker from injury or if he, while accurate, does not have sufficient distance on kickoffs.

Amateur teams (e.g., college or high school) often do not differentiate between placekickers and punters, have different players assume different placekicking duties (for example, one person handles kicking off, another kicks long field goals, and another kicks from shorter distances), or have regular position players handle kicking duties. The last option is quite common on high school teams, when the best athletes are often the best kickers. Before the modern era of pro football, this was also the case for professional teams, particularly when most placekicks were still made in the &quot;straight on&quot; style outlined below.

Although kickers are protected from direct physical contact on field goal attempts, this is not generally true on kickoffs, and a kicker can see significant contact during a kick return. Kicker Björn Nittmo notably suffered severe brain damage from a hit he sustained on a kickoff in 1997.

Still, due to their lack of plays in games and lack of contact compared to other positions, the top kickers in the NFL have often had extremely long careers, far beyond that of a typical NFL player. Of the eight players in NFL history who have played beyond the age of 45, six of them are kickers: Morten Andersen, Gary Anderson, John Carney, Ben Agajanian, Adam Vinatieri, and George Blanda (Blanda was the oldest player in NFL history, playing until the age of 48).

==Team standing==

It is not uncommon for placekickers to be some of the smallest members of their team. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2011 wrote that NFL kickers had adopted year-round weight training and strict diets. Sebastian Janikowski that year was a and kicker. Kicker Rob Bironas, who was and , noted, &quot;I might be bigger than some wide receivers and cornerbacks.&quot;

The presence of foreign born-and-raised players in the highest levels of gridiron football has largely been limited to placekickers, and more recently to punters from Australia as well. Occasionally, these players come from outside the traditional American high school or college football systems—and most of the women to have played men&#x27;s American football at the college level were placekickers. Notably Tom Landry recruited several soccer players from Latin America, such as Efren Herrera and Raphael Septien, to compete for the job of placekicker for the Dallas Cowboys. Cypriot Garo Yepremian was renowned as much for his kicking proficiency as he was for his complete lack of awareness of the sport early in his career. British-born kicker Mick Luckhurst was one of the first British players in the NFL to have a long career, playing 7 seasons for the Atlanta Falcons during the 1980s and retiring as Atlanta&#x27;s all-time leading scorer. Mexican kicker Raul Allegre played 9 seasons in the NFL and won a Super Bowl in 1986. Austrian kicker Toni Fritsch played 12 seasons in the NFL and won a Super Bowl in 1972, becoming the only player in NFL history to have won a Super Bowl along with a top-flight association football title. These anecdotes increase the perception of the placekicker as an outsider.

As of 2017, only four kickers have been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: George Blanda, Lou Groza, Jan Stenerud and Morten Andersen, and among them, Stenerud and Andersen are the only ones who did not also play another position. There is only one special teams player (including punters, return specialists and long snappers) to ever win the NFL&#x27;s MVP – Mark Moseley in 1982.

Nevertheless, due to their duties in kicking both field goals and extra points placekickers are usually responsible for scoring more points than any other player on a team, and very often entire football games may come down to a single kick. The top 40 players in NFL history in career scoring are all placekickers, with receiver Jerry Rice at number 41.

===Numbering===
In the NFL, placekickers, along with punters and quarterbacks, used to be among the only players allowed to wear single-digit uniform numbers; kickers can also wear numbers between 10 and 19.

In college and high school football, kickers can wear any number and usually wear one of an eligible receiver (1 to 49 or 80 to 99). Because kickers are generally less prominent on team rosters, and low uniform numbers are much more widely used among other positions at those levels, kickers are often given high jersey numbers that go unused by other players (such as numbers in the 40s or 90s). The two players in documented football history to have worn the uniform number 100, Chuck Kinder and Bill Bell, were both placekickers.

=== Outside North America===
Despite a higher share of kickers in the NFL being foreign nationals than on any other position (except punter), the kicking game is not always the strong suit of teams outside North America. The NFL Europe was notable for employing former professional association football players as placekickers, some of them becoming fan favorites, like Manni Burgsmüller. The European League of Football in its inaugural 2021 season had a relatively high share of Point after Touchdown attempts miss or be blocked and had a notably higher share of Two Point Conversion attempts even than the contemporary 2021 German Football League. The Cologne Centurions (ELF) and the Leipzig Kings even had all their Field Goal attempts that season fail (0-1 and 0-3 respectively in a ten-game season). The Barcelona Dragons (ELF) hired NFL alumnus Giorgio Tavecchio late in the season to improve their kicking game while the Hamburg Sea Devils (ELF) got lucky with journeyman placekicker :de:Phillip Friis Andersen making 17 out of 18 attempts during the regular season, including a game winning one in the league opener against Frankfurt Galaxy (ELF).

==Kicking style==
Placekickers today are predominantly &quot;soccer-style&quot; kickers, approaching the ball from several steps to the left of it [for a right-footed kicker, or vice versa] and several steps behind, striking the ball with the instep of the foot; all current National Football League kickers use this style. This method of kicking was introduced in 1957 by Fred Bednarski and popularized in the 1960s by kickers like Pete Gogolak and his younger brother Charlie, the first placekicker to be drafted in the first round.

Previously, most placekickers used a &quot;straight on&quot; style, which required the use of a special shoe that is extremely rigid and has a flattened and slightly upturned toe. In the straight on style, also known as &quot;straight-toe&quot; style, the kicker approaches the ball from directly behind, rather than from the side, and strikes the ball with the toe.

The last full-time straight on placekicker in the NFL was Mark Moseley who retired from the Cleveland Browns after the 1986 season, and the last straight-on kicker drafted into the NFL was Manny Matsakis from Capital University by the Philadelphia Eagles in 1984, who went on to have a successful college and coaching career. The Minnesota Vikings were the last NFL team to begin employing a soccer-style kicker, bringing in Benny Ricardo in 1983.

Straight on kickers are relatively uncommon in major college football due to the control and power disadvantages, but straight-on kickers are still seen on high school, small-college, semi-pro and amateur teams. Both of the top awards for kickers in college football are named after former straight-on kickers Fred Mitchell and Lou Groza but are now won by soccer-style players.

There are variations between soccer-style kicking: many of the early soccer-style NFL kickers had an action somewhat different from today&#x27;s soccer-style kickers. There are also differences between college / preps vs most of the preps taught between kicking schools. Kicking Coach Paul Assad started teaching in the early 2000s what is termed &quot;The Power X System&quot; method used by most all of his over 51 NFL starting specialist students such as noteworthy, NFL greats like (Mason Crosby, Sebastian Janikowski, Matt Bryant among others) where there is a notable, differentials of leg alignment, foot position at impact, upper body positioning and sequence as well as &quot;Plant Foot&quot; positioning.

==Shoes==
Placekickers in the modern game usually wear specialized shoes (soccer cleats). The reason for this is that, as compared to regular football cleats which use tougher and stiffer plastic, soccer cleats are primarily made out of leather. Kickers will also, in certain situations, wear two different cleats. One is their kicking cleat and the other is referred to as their plant foot. The reason that kickers will wear a football cleat on their plant foot as opposed to a soccer cleat is because the stiffer material will help the plant foot have a firm grip in the ground and hold the kicker&#x27;s ankle in a tight position. In very rare circumstances, though, some prefer to kick barefoot. Tony Franklin was one such barefoot kicker, who played in Super Bowls for the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots. Another was Rich Karlis, who once shared two kicking records - the record for longest field goal in Super Bowl history, kicking a 48-yard field goal in Super Bowl XXI to tie Jan Stenerud and also for the most field goals in a game, seven for Minnesota in 1989, tying Jim Bakken&#x27;s record of the time, a record since broken by Rob Bironas. Englishman Rob Hart kicked barefoot during his 7-year NFL Europe career. John Baker also used the style in the 1990s in the Canadian Football League, as did José Cortéz in the XFL. The last person to kick barefoot in an NFL game was Jeff Wilkins in 2002.

A unique shoe was worn by New Orleans Saints kicker Tom Dempsey; Dempsey had a deformed kicking foot that left him with a flat kicking surface at the front of his foot, and he wore a shoe that accommodated it. After Dempsey kicked a record-setting 63-yard field goal using the special shoe in 1970, the league instituted a rule change establishing standards for kicking shoes in 1977, informally known as the &quot;Tom Dempsey Rule&quot;, that &quot;any shoe that is worn by a player with an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoe.&quot; Dempsey played for two more years after the rule&#x27;s institution, retiring in 1979.

Barefoot kickers are banned in the vast majority of high school games, due to a rule by the National Federation of State High School Associations, which requires all players to wear shoes. Texas plays by NCAA rules, and therefore barefoot kickers are legal in Texas.

<doc id="1116811" wikidata="Q1900" url="?curid=1116811" title="Cagliari Calcio">
<text>Cagliari Calcio, commonly referred to as Cagliari (), is an Italian football club based in Cagliari, Sardinia, that plays in Serie A, the first tier of Italian football. The club currently plays home matches at the 16,416-seat Unipol Domus.

Founded in 1920, they won their first and only &quot;Scudetto&quot; in 1969–70, when they were led by the Italian national team&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, Gigi Riva. The triumph was also the first by a club from south of Rome. The club&#x27;s best European performance was in the 1993–94 UEFA Cup, reaching the semi-finals before losing to eventual winners Internazionale.

As with the flag of its city, Cagliari&#x27;s mi colours are blue and red. The club badge incorporates the flag of Sardinia.

==History==

===Before Serie A===
Cagliari became the first ever out-right champions of Serie C during the 1951–52 season; prior to that in the league, the championship was shared amongst more than one team. They spent the 1950s from then on in Serie B, losing a promotion play-off in 1954. After descending to Serie C in the early 1960s, Cagliari&#x27;s rise would be meteoric, eventually achieving promotion to Serie A in 1964.

===First Serie A adventure: 1964–1976===
The squad for the &quot;Rossoblu&quot;&#x27;s debut season in Serie A featured players like defender Mario Martiradonna, midfielders Pierluigi Cera, Nené and Ricciotti Greatti, and forward Gigi Riva. A poor first half of the season, however, saw Cagliari in last place with nine points at the halfway mark. An astonishing second half of the season saw Cagliari defeat the likes of Juventus and Milan and finish in seventh place with 34 points. Two seasons later, Riva finished as Serie A&#x27;s top scorer for the first time while Cagliari finished with the league&#x27;s best defensive record.
During the summer of 1967, Cagliari played a season in North America as part of a fledgling league called the United Soccer Association. This league included teams from Europe and South America set to play in American and Canadian cities, with each club bearing a local name. Cagliari played as the Chicago Mustangs, and finished joint second in the league&#x27;s Western Division with 13 points, two behind the division champion and eventual league champion Los Angeles Wolves. The league&#x27;s leading scorer was Chicago/Cagliari&#x27;s Roberto Boninsegna, who scored ten goals while playing in 9 of the team&#x27;s 12 games.

Cagliari first emerged as serious Serie A title contenders in 1968–69 with a three-horse race involving them, Fiorentina and Milan. Fiorentina would win the league, but the following season would bring ultimate glory. With Angelo Domenghini joining the side, Cagliari would win the title in 1970 with only two games lost, 11 goals conceded (the fewest in any major European league to date) and Riva as league top scorer once more. Players like Albertosi, Niccolai, Boninsegna, Gori, Cera, Domenghini and Riva played in Italy&#x27;s 1970 World Cup final team.

The 1970s would see a gradual decline (though were title contenders two years after their one and only &quot;Scudetto&quot; win). Cagliari were finally relegated in 1976, with Riva&#x27;s career having effectively ended during that season.

===Up and down again: 1976–87===
After relegation, Cagliari lost a play-off for promotion the following season and would return to Serie A in 1979. Players like Franco Selvaggi, Mario Brugnera (a survivor of the 1970 team) and Alberto Marchetti ensured a respectable four-year stay in the top flight before a second relegation in 1983. The 1980s would then prove to be a darker time compared to the previous two decades with relegation to Serie C1 in 1987.

===There and back: 1987–2000===
Cagliari spent two seasons in Serie C1. In the first one it barely avoided relegation in Serie C2. In 1988, Claudio Ranieri was appointed coach, and led the team to two successive promotions, to Serie B in 1989 and to Serie A in 1990. The first two seasons back in Serie A saw Cagliari fight relegation, with safety being achieved by excellent second half runs. But the 1992–93 season would see Cagliari fight for a European place and succeed under the management of Carlo Mazzone. The following season saw a best-ever run to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, taking out Juventus in the quarter-finals before being eliminated 5–3 on aggregate by compatriots Internazionale, having won the first leg 3–2 at home.

The next few years would see Cagliari return to mid-table anonymity, before a struggle in 1996–97 saw Cagliari relegated after losing a play-off to Piacenza. Once more they bounced back after just one year, but their next stay in Serie A lasted just two seasons.

===Once and again: 2000 onwards===
Cagliari spent the next four seasons in Serie B, until in 2003–04 with Sardinian-born veteran striker Gianfranco Zola, the team won promotion. In 2005–06, the first season without Zola, the team changed their manager three times before Nedo Sonetti, appointed in November, was able to save the team from relegation, especially thanks to the excellent goal contribution from Honduran striker David Suazo.

Apart from finishing 9th in 2008–09 season, Cagliari regularly finished in the bottom half of Serie A under a sequence of managers, before being relegated in 2014–15. They gained promotion back the following season as champions of Serie B.

In 2014, the company passed, after 22 years of Massimo Cellino&#x27;s presidency, into the hands of Tommaso Giulini, president and owner of Fluorsid, a multinational in the chemical sector. Relegation took place in the first season, but the team won the Serie B championship in 2016, returning permanently to the top division, albeit always finishing in the second half of the table. Cagliari was relegated at the end of the 2021–22 season. They reappointed Claudio Ranieri halfway through the 2022–23 season with the club in fourteenth place. Under Ranieri&#x27;s management, Cagliari won the 2022–23 Serie B playoffs.

==Stadium==

Cagliari moved from the Stadio Amsicora to the Stadio Sant&#x27;Elia in 1970, after winning their only league title. It was renovated for Italy&#x27;s hosting of the 1990 FIFA World Cup where it hosted all of England&#x27;s group games, ostensibly to confine the team&#x27;s notorious hooligans to an island.

Disputes with the city council over renovation of the publicly owned stadium meant that Cagliari played their final home games of 2011–12 at the Stadio Nereo Rocco in Trieste on the Italian mainland. For most of the following season, the club played at the Stadio Is Arenas in the neighbouring municipality of Quartu Sant&#x27;Elena. It was deemed unsafe by the league, forcing them to play behind closed doors before leaving the ground in April 2013. The Sant&#x27;Elia was demolished for a new stadium in 2017, and the club moved to the temporary Sardegna Arena next to it.

==Colours, badge and nicknames==

The official red and blue colours of Cagliari mirror those featured on the &quot;stemma&quot; of Cagliari. The red parts of the stemma are a reference to the coat of arms of the House of Savoy, a family which was previously the monarchy of Italy and more relevantly to Cagliari in particular, the Kingdom of Sardinia. The blue part of the &quot;stemma&quot; features the sky and the sea, also a castle; this is because the old historic centre of Cagliari is walled and called the &quot;Castello&quot;. Due to the use of these colours on their shirt in halves, the club is commonly nicknamed &quot;rossoblu&quot;.

Cagliari have had several different logo designs during their history, all of which feature the flag of Sardinia. Usually the badge also features the club colours; if there is a change, the main difference has been the colour of the border or the shape. Since June 2015, the badge features an &quot;Old French&quot;-shaped escutcheon with red and blue halves, with the club&#x27;s name written in white just above the flag of Sardinia. The Moors&#x27; heads have, for the first time, been turned to the right as of 2015 so as to match the Sardinian flag after it was updated in 1992.

Because Cagliari are the main club from the island of Sardinia, they are nicknamed the &quot;Isolani&quot; (&quot;Islanders&quot;).

== Supporters ==

In the 1970s, the ultras movement developed, as in Italy. The first group was founded in 1977 with the name of Brigate Rossoblù, which was joined by Fossa Ultrà, with the latter progressing in the early 1980s to follow the team also on the &quot;Continent&quot; and to meet with other opposing fans. However, the phenomenon also waned due to the team&#x27;s downward trajectory in that decade after the glories of the Scudetto. However, the Commando Ultrà Young Supporters was born and later merged with the Ultrà Cagliari. In February 1987 some of the members of these groups gave rise to the Sconvolts who were joined by an already existing group, the Eagles. Two years later, in 1989, Furiosi were also born. These two groups monopolized the hottest support throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, never bonding as happened with the previous groups and indeed leading to an internal struggle which led to the dissolution of the Furiosi in 2004 and led the Sconvolts group to still be the only ultras fringe remaining in the Curva Nord of the various stadiums that have taken place in recent years.

== Friendships and Rivalries ==

<text>The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (known as CIAT from its Spanish-language name ) is an international research and development organization dedicated to reducing poverty and hunger while protecting natural resources in developing countries. It is based in Palmira, Colombia, where it employs over 300 scientists.

CIAT is one of the 14 agricultural research centers of the CGIAR. In 2019, CIAT joined with Bioversity International (as the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT) to &quot;deliver research-based solutions that harness agricultural biodiversity and sustainably transform food systems to improve people’s lives&quot;.

==Future Seeds Gene bank==
CIAT has one of the 11 gene banks of the CGIAR, with a collection of more than 65,000 accessions of three crops: beans (37,000); tropical forages (23,000) and cassava (6,000), from more than 100 countries. With funding from the United Kingdom, the Colombian government and others, in 2022 inaugurated a new facility to host those accessions called &#x27;Future seeds&#x27; in which not only expanded its capacity to up tp 250,000 accessions, but creating an architectural landmark and environmentally sustainable infrastructure, and a hub for research and learning

The research conducted at this center includes, as of 2013, a research on developing better varieties of grain legumes. The goals are tolerances to drought, low phosphorus soils, and heat; in addition to improved nitrogen fixation. CIAT coordinated the activities of the Pan-Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA) in 29 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. This effort was supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)

<text>The red-fan parrot (Deroptyus accipitrinus), also known as the hawk-headed parrot, is a New World parrot hailing from the Amazon Rainforest. It is the only member of the genus &quot;Deroptyus&quot;.

It is found in Brazil, Suriname, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, areas of northeast Peru, Venezuela, French Guiana and Guyana.

==Taxonomy==
The red-fan parrot was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other parrots in the genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus accipitrinus&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;hawk-headed parrot&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1751 by the English naturalist George Edwards in the fourth volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Linnaeus mistakenly specified the type locality as India. It was redesignated as Cayenne in French Guiana by Carl Hellmayr in 1905. The red-fan parrot is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Deroptyus&quot; that was introduced in 1832 by the German naturalist Johann Wagler. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;neck&quot; with meaning &quot;fan&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;accipitrinus&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;hawk-like&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;D. a. accipitrinus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – southeast Colombia to northeast Peru, north Brazil and the Guianas
* &quot;D. a. fuscifrons&quot; Hellmayr, 1905 – central Brazil south of the Amazon

== Description ==
The red-fan parrot possesses elongated neck feathers that can be raised to form an elaborate fan, which greatly increases the bird&#x27;s apparent size, and is possibly used when threatened. It generally lives in undisturbed forest, feeding in the canopy on fruits. It has a dark brown face with white streaks, bare black patch round its brown eye, green wings, flanks and tail and red and blue barred breast.

== Behavior ==
The bird nests in holes in trees and stumps. Two to three eggs are normally laid, hatching after approximately 26 days. The young start to fledge in the wild at approximately 10 weeks old. Only two nests have been examined in the wild; both had one chick.

It is not considered threatened, but is listed on CITES Appendix II (as are most parrots not listed on Appendix I).

==Aviculture==
Red-fan parrots, although not particularly common in aviculture, are sometimes kept as aviary birds or companion parrots. While juvenile birds tend to be docile, adults can be particularly ill-tempered, stubborn, unpredictable and strong-willed birds, showing extreme aggression towards humans and other birds housed with them (including others of their own species and/or their own mates), particularly when in breeding condition. Red-fan parrots, when kept as pets tend to bond with one person and require firm handling and a patient owner, experienced in both bird-keeping and the reading of parrot body language. However, as with all parrots, temperament can vary greatly from individual to individual and some red-fan parrots make excellent companions.

<text>This Time Around is the second studio album by American pop rock group Hanson, released in 2000. Although Hanson had several albums in between, &quot;This Time Around&quot; is their first standard studio release since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;. &quot;This Time Around&quot; did not achieve the commercial success of its predecessor &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;. The album does not feature as many bubblegum pop style tunes as &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;; instead, Hanson opted to focus on a more classic rock sound, or as MTV.com stated, &quot;stadium rock&quot;. The album also features numerous ballads, with songs such as &quot;Sure About It&quot; and &quot;A Song to Sing&quot; covering the themes of teenage insecurity and loneliness, much like &quot;Weird&quot; from &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;. Critically, &quot;This Time Around&quot; received mainly positive reviews. To date, it has sold over one million copies worldwide.

==Critical reception==

Critically, &quot;This Time Around&quot; received mainly positive reviews. It was given a score of 67 out of 100 by Metacritic. &quot;Billboard&quot; said, &quot;It all adds up to a collection that successfully sets Hanson apart from the current teen-pop phenomenon that it helped start -- at least from a creative perspective,&quot; and CDNow said &quot;This Time Around scores with more sophisticated harmonies and storytelling.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;Like a blond three-headed hydra, Hanson loom over the competition, making all other teen idols sound like Gerber-sucking clowns.&quot; AllMusic said, &quot;It&#x27;s hard not to miss the thrilling way Middle of Nowhere leapt out of the speakers upon its first spin with giddy fun, yet with its carefully considered craft and warmly ingratiating pop songs This Time Around is winning entertainment.&quot; However, not everyone was complimentary about the change in musical style, with Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; stating &quot;If you thought they were bad when they were cute, or even that they were cute when they were good, believe me, you don&#x27;t want to hear them mature,&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; with the even harsher verdict: &quot;But damn those cruel hormones – Hanson&#x27;s collective balls have MmmDropped, and the giddy rush of adolescence seeks to mutate Mercury&#x27;s finest investment into a trio of crack-voiced hulks.&quot;

==Singles==
*&quot;If Only&quot; was released as the lead single outside the United States on April 3, 2000. The song features John Popper of the band Blues Traveler on harmonica. The music video features the group traveling in a desert on their tour bus, unloading their equipment to shoot the video. The song reached the top 10 in Australia, Finland, Italy, and Spain and entered the charts of other European countries.
*&quot;This Time Around&quot; was released on April 4, 2000, as the lead single in the United States and Canada, peaking at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was also released in Australia as the second single.
*&quot;Save Me&quot; was released on July 15 only in United Kingdom and Brazil. The song was included in the soundtrack to the Brazilian soap opera &quot;Laços de Família&quot; (&quot;Family Ties&quot;). &quot;Save Me&quot; was certified gold by Pro-Música Brasil in 2024.

<text>The Admiralty Head Light is a deactivated aid to navigation located on Whidbey Island near Coupeville, Island County, Washington, on the grounds of Fort Casey State Park. The restored lighthouse overlooks Admiralty Inlet. It was the companion to the Point Wilson Light, which sits four miles away on Admiralty Inlet&#x27;s western shore.

==History==
Two lighthouses have been built on Admiralty Head. Only the second remains. Admiralty Head, the east entrance point of Admiralty Inlet, is the southeast extremity of a succession of bluffs extending northward along the western shore of Whidbey Island to Point Partridge, where the bluffs attain their highest elevation.
;Original lighthouse
In 1858, the United States purchased on the headland for $400. The original lighthouse was a wooden, two-story house with tower projecting from the gable. It was completed in 1861. It had a fourth order Fresnel lens, which was visible at . In 1890, construction of Fort Casey forced the relocation of the lighthouse to a spot close to the site of the present lighthouse. It was demolished in 1928.
;Present lighthouse
A second, lighthouse, constructed of brick and stucco, was built in 1903. The design by Carl Leick incorporated thick walls meant to withstand earthquakes and the concussion of Fort Casey&#x27;s guns. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1922, and the lantern moved to the New Dungeness Lighthouse in 1927. During its later occupancy by the Army, the lighthouse was used as a training facility for the K-9 dog program. In 1990, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 25-cent stamp featuring the Admiralty Head Light.
;Restoration
The lighthouse has been restored by Washington State Parks and is sponsored by the Lighthouse Environmental Program (LEP), a collaborative function between Washington State University&#x27;s Extension Office and local environmental programs. In 2012, an historically accurate reconstruction of the lantern house was installed atop the tower. The work was done by student volunteers from three Whidbey Island high schools.

<text>The Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) is a non-profit scientific research organization that conducts research on the use and management of forests with a focus on tropical forests in developing countries. CIFOR, which merged with World Agroforestry (known by the acronym ICRAF) on Jan. 1, 2019, is the forestry and agroforestry research center of CGIAR, a network of 15 research centers around the world that focus on agricultural research for sustainable development, working closely with governments and other partners to help develop evidence-based solutions to problems related to sustainable agriculture and natural resource management.

CIFOR-ICRAF research is intended to &quot;deliver actionable evidence and solutions to transform how land is used and how food is produced: conserving and restoring ecosystems, responding to the global climate, malnutrition, biodiversity and desertification crises.&quot; It also contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, commitments under the Rio Convention, including the Paris agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

== Overview ==

CIFOR&#x27;s research and expert analysis help policy makers and practitioners shape policy, improve the management of tropical forests and address the needs of people who depend on forests for their livelihoods. CIFOR&#x27;s multidisciplinary approach considers the underlying drivers of deforestation and degradation, which often lie outside the forestry sector: forces such as agriculture, infrastructure development, trade and investment policies, and law enforcement.

CIFOR has its headquarters in Bogor, Indonesia. The current Director General is Robert Nasi. It has three regional offices: in Burkina Faso (West Africa), Cameroon (Central Africa) and Kenya (East and South Africa). It has project offices in Ethiopia and Zambia (Africa), Vietnam and Laos (Asia), and Brazil and Peru (Latin America). CIFOR is one of 15 centers within the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).

In implementing its research, CIFOR collaborates with other centers within the CGIAR—the World Agroforestry Centre, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and Bioversity International—to conduct the CGIAR Consortium Research Programme &quot;Forests, Trees and Agroforestry&quot; (also known as CRP6). CRP6 objective is to enhance the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape, from forests to farms.

== History ==
Although many link CIFOR&#x27;s creation to the 1992 Earth Summit because it came into existence the following year, the discussions that led to founding CIFOR predated the Earth Summit by several years. In 1991, the CGIAR appointed the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) as the implementing agency responsible for establishing CIFOR and setting up a board of trustees. CIFOR&#x27;s Establishment Agreement was signed by Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States; the Agreement was lodged with the United Nations and CIFOR&#x27;s legal identity as an international organisation was consolidated with a Host Country Agreement between the new Board and the Government of Indonesia in May 1993.

Over time, CIFOR increased the focus of its research on forest policy rather than on technical forestry or tree breeding, in order to complement the efforts of national and private-sector institutes. Instead of having laboratories, CIFOR would be a &#x27;center without walls&#x27;, marshaling interdisciplinary research teams in collaboration with partners to tackle forest policy changes.

== Partners ==

CIFOR works with government agencies and non-governmental organization in the countries where its scientists conduct research. Top partners include the CGIAR, European Union, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australian Aid), US Agency for International Development (USAID), BMZ/BMUB, Global Environment Facility (GEF), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Austrian Development Agency, British Department for International Development (DFID), French Global Environment Facility, and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.

== Strategy ==
CIFOR&#x27;s first strategy, set out in 1996, provided the foundations and direction for research that affected the understanding and practice of forest management throughout the tropics. But the world&#x27;s forests and the way they are perceived have changed dramatically since CIFOR was established.

Foremost among many changes is that forests are today centre-stage in the global debate on how to tackle climate change. Almost 20 per cent of global carbon emissions are caused by deforestation, and so curbing forest loss is a way to reduce global warming. Also the promotion of biofuels by governments concerned about global warming is driving forest clearance in some areas.

To respond to these and other challenges, CIFOR devised a new strategy for a new era. Approved by the Board of Trustees in May 2008, the strategy will guide CIFOR&#x27;s work until 2018.

== CGIAR Research Programme on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry ==
CIFOR is the leading center for the CGIAR Research Programme &#x27;Forests, Trees and Agroforestry&#x27; (also known as CRP6). This initiative brings together four Centers who specialise in their respective subjects—the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), CIFOR, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and Bioversity International. The programme will convene expertise across the CGIAR system, and will partner with research and practitioner organisations around the world.
Within the consortium research program, the research focus is organised into five components with the clear objective of enhancing the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape from forests to farms.

===Component 1: Smallholder production systems and markets===
Component 1 focuses on the needs of smallholder producers, with an emphasis on enhancing the productivity of trees on farms (e.g. through domestication of wild species) and improving access for smallholders to markets for forest and tree products.

Research themes
*Enhancing management and production systems for smallholders (food security and nutrition)
*Increasing income generation and market integration for smallholders
*Improving policies and institutions to enhance social assets to secure rights in forest- and tree-dependent communities

=== Component 2: Management and conservation of forest and tree resources ===
Component 2 focuses on the needs of forest managers at the level of the forest management unit, with an emphasis on improved technical and governance approaches to conserving forest ecosystems and the genetic resources they contain.

Research themes
*Understanding threats to tree species and formulating genetic conservation strategies
*Conserving and characterising high-quality germplasm of tree crops and their wild relatives
*Developing improved silvicultural, monitoring and management practices for multiple use
*Developing tools and methods to resolve conflicts over distribution of benefits and resource rights

=== Component 3: Environmental services and landscape management ===
Component 3 focuses on the needs of landscape-level planners and stakeholders, with an emphasis on mechanisms (such as payments for environmental services or PES) for capturing the value of environmental services and for negotiating trade-offs among competing conservation and development objectives.

Research themes
*Understanding drivers of forest transition
*Understanding the consequences of forest transition for environmental services and livelihoods
=== Component 4: Climate change adaptation and mitigation ===
Component 4 focuses on the needs of policymakers and land managers seeking to build forests, trees and agroforestry into climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Research themes
*Harnessing forests, trees and agroforestry for climate change mitigation
*Enhancing climate change adaptation
*Understanding synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation

=== Component 5: Impacts of trade and investment on forests and people ===
Component 5 focuses on the needs of policymakers and land managers seeking to ensure that the effects of globalised trade and investment flows are beneficial to forests and the communities that depend on forests for their livelihoods.

Research themes
*Understanding the processes and effects of forest-related trade and investment
*Enhancing responses and policy options to mitigate the harm and enhance the benefits of trade and investment

== Other major projects ==

=== Global Comparative Study on REDD+===
Source:

Over four years, CIFOR and its partner organisations are undertaking a major global comparative study on the implementation of pilot REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) projects.

The aim of the study is to compare how pilot REDD+ projects are working at national and subnational levels, and share lessons learned from these comparisons for the benefit of everyone involved in designing and implementing REDD+ projects. Essentially, by providing policy makers and communities with this information, the project aims to ensure implementation of REDD+ is as effective, cost-efficient and equitable as possible—and ultimately reduces carbon emissions, deforestation and forest degradation across the world, while producing benefits like poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.

Research for the global comparative study is being undertaken in 11 countries—Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Nepal, Peru, Tanzania and Vietnam.

===Poverty and Environment Network===
Source:

The Poverty and Environment Network (PEN) is an international research project and network launched by CIFOR in September 2004 and completed in 2010. PEN still exists as a database containing survey data on more than 8,000 households in more than 40 study sites in 25 developing countries.

It was the largest and most comprehensive global analysis of tropical forests and poverty, and aimed to put a systematic framework of knowledge around the role tropical forests play in poverty alleviation. The project aimed to provide data on the ways that poor people depend on forest resources, in order to both inform mainstream forest policy design and to contribute to the design of policies and projects to alleviate poverty, and thereby contribute to meeting the Millennium Development Goal of 50% poverty reduction by 2015.

In order for the socioeconomic data to be uniform and therefore comparable across countries and project sites, research partners (mainly PhD students) from a number of universities and research institutes collected quarterly data at the household and village level using standardised definitions, questionnaires and methods. The study sites were chosen to obtain representative coverage of geographical regions, forest types, forest tenure regimes, levels of poverty, infrastructure and market access, and population density.

Preliminary results from the study’s global database showed that among those surveyed, forest income – on average – constituted more than one fifth of total household income, while environmental income (forest and non-forest) made up more than one fourth.

== Communicating research ==
According to past Director General Frances Seymour, CIFOR considers bridging the gap between research, policy and practice through effective communications is one of its challenges as a research organization. The organization is committed to sharing its research and other information with others in the research community, and also with policymakers, indigenous and community groups, donor agencies, the media and the general public.

It has three performance venues: the Alumni Recital Hall, home to musical performances and the annual KSC Film Festival; the Main Theatre, which hosts touring performances and college productions and can seat 572; and the Wright Theatre (formerly the Studio Theatre), which was named after Ruth McCaffery Wright &#x27;29, and dedicated in May 1995. The Wright Theatre is a flexible black box theatre, allowing for a variety of theatre configurations. It is used primarily by the Theatre and Dance Department as a performance space and classroom. The building also houses fine arts classes including painting, drawing, sculpture and printmaking.

===Spaulding Gymnasium===
The Spaulding Gymnasium and Recreation Center is open to all KSC students and faculty free of charge, and to the general public for a fee. In addition to the large main gym, it includes a pool, a suspended track, a weight room, and an aerobics room. Spaulding houses the Exercise Science and Athletic Training majors.

===TDS Center===
This building is used for the architecture department as well as the product design students. It also houses the Safety &amp; Occupational Health Applied Sciences program - the increase in number of students majoring in the Safety &amp; Occupational Health Applied Sciences program has allowed it to grow into a Master&#x27;s program.

===Thorne-Sagendorph Art Gallery===
The Thorne-Sagendorph art gallery displays student work from the various traditional arts. It is occasionally host to touring exhibits and is open daily for viewing.

===Young Student Center===
The Young Student Center was named for Lloyd P. Young, who served as the school&#x27;s president from 1939 to 1964. It is one of the tallest buildings on campus and is home to the campus bookstore, several food vendors, the campus mailroom, the Mabel Brown auditorium, student organization offices, and WKNH, the college&#x27;s student-run radio station.

===Zorn Dining Commons===
The Zorn dining commons was formerly located in the building now known as Media Arts Center. Keene State built a much larger facility that opened in the fall of 2005. It features a variety of dining options. Within the Zorn building but outside the dining area proper is the Hoot-N-Scoot/SONO, a take-out facility with prepackaged meals.

=== Owl&#x27;s Nests ===
The Owl&#x27;s Nests consist of 9 small buildings and a separate laundry building which together house sophomore-seniors. Rooms range from lofted suites, traditional suites, and singles.

<text>The International Potato Center (known as CIP from its Spanish-language name Centro Internacional de la Papa) is a research facility based in Lima, Peru, that seeks to reduce poverty and achieve food security on a sustained basis in developing countries through scientific research and related activities on potato, sweet potato, other root and tuber crops, and on the improved management of natural resources in the Andes and other mountain areas. 

== History ==
The International Potato Center was established in 1971 by decree of the Peruvian government.

In 1991 the World Vegetable Center (WVC) chose to end its sweet potato research. The WVC duplicated and transferred its research and germplasm to the International Potato Center and Taiwan Agricultural Research institute.

CIP is one of the 15 specialized research centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, an international consortium of agricultural research organizations, having joined in 1972.

In late 2015, it partnered with NASA to attempt to grow potatoes in a simulated Martian environment. In March 2017, it announced that preliminary indications are positive.

==CIP-Georgia==
In 2015, CIP began a 3-year project to &quot;Enhance the rural livelihood of Georgia&quot;, for which in 2017 the Republic of Austria provided funding, delegated to the Austrian Development Agency, which was extended an additional three years. The project&#x27;s goal is to &quot;improve the livelihoods of Georgian farmers by increasing profitability and sustainability of their potato crops and to increase capacity of national players in the potato seed value chain.&quot;

<doc id="1116842" wikidata="Q1228843" url="?curid=1116842" title="Discrepancy theory">
<text>In mathematics, discrepancy theory describes the deviation of a situation from the state one would like it to be in. It is also called the theory of irregularities of distribution. This refers to the theme of &quot;classical&quot; discrepancy theory, namely distributing points in some space such that they are evenly distributed with respect to some (mostly geometrically defined) subsets. The discrepancy (irregularity) measures how far a given distribution deviates from an ideal one.

Discrepancy theory can be described as the study of inevitable irregularities of distributions, in measure-theoretic and combinatorial settings. Just as Ramsey theory elucidates the impossibility of total disorder, discrepancy theory studies the deviations from total uniformity.

A significant event in the history of discrepancy theory was the 1916 paper of Weyl on the uniform distribution of sequences in the unit interval.

== Theorems ==
Discrepancy theory is based on the following classic theorems:
* Geometric discrepancy theory
* The theorem of van Aardenne-Ehrenfest
* Arithmetic progressions (Roth, Sarkozy, Beck, Matousek &amp; Spencer)
* Beck–Fiala theorem
* Six Standard Deviations Suffice (Spencer)

== Major open problems ==
The unsolved problems relating to discrepancy theory include:
* Axis-parallel rectangles in dimensions three and higher (folklore)
* Komlós conjecture 
* Heilbronn triangle problem on the minimum area of a triangle determined by three points from an &quot;n&quot;-point set

== Applications ==
Applications for discrepancy theory include:
* Numerical integration: Monte Carlo methods in high dimensions
* Computational geometry: Divide-and-conquer algorithm
* Image processing: Halftoning
* Random trial formulation: Randomized controlled trial 
== See also ==
*Discrepancy of hypergraphs
*Geometric discrepancy theory

<doc id="1116844" wikidata="Q5615408" url="?curid=1116844" title="Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval">
<text>The Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval (officially stylized as OVAL), formerly the John Rose Minnesota Oval, is an outdoor ice rink in Roseville, Minnesota, United States. It is claimed to be the largest artificial outdoor skating surface in North America. The facility was constructed from June to December 1993. It was the subject of a $3.9 million renovation project which was set to be completed before the opening of the rink&#x27;s 29th season on November 18, 2022. It is the home of bandy in the United States and is used by the United States men&#x27;s national bandy team and the United States women&#x27;s national bandy team.

==Rink==
The rink consists of a concrete surface (a 400-meter track surrounding an infield ice arena) with of embedded cooling tubes and an 800-ton refrigeration system. When the temperature is above —the highest temperature at which an icy surface can be maintained—the concrete surface can be used for inline skating.

==History==
The Oval had its beginnings in 1983, when then-governor Rudy Perpich dreamed of hosting the Olympic Games. As part of the bid preparation, a task force was formed to determine locations of new facilities. After years of local efforts, Roseville was selected. The city was awarded state bonding money for the design and construction of a multi-purpose outdoor skating facility, which opened in December 1993. The facility was named after John Rose, a Roseville teacher, member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, and avid supporter of youth sports.

The Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval hosted the 1995 Bandy World Championship for men and the 2006 Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship. It has also hosted US Speedskating Championships, US Junior Speedskating Championships, American Cup Speedskating, World Cup Speedskating, National Bandy Championships, and Aggressive Skating Association competitions. The Minnesota Wild held their hockey jersey unveiling at the Oval, and notable visitors have included Dan Jansen, Bonnie Blair, Paul Wylie, and Neal Broten. The facility is the main training site for the United States national bandy team and local hockey and speedskating clubs.

Leaks in the cooling system were discovered in 2004, making the season&#x27;s service uncertain. In June 2005, the Guidant Foundation contributed $500,000 to allow for needed repairs to the facility&#x27;s refrigeration system. The Oval&#x27;s official name was changed in recognition of the Foundation&#x27;s gift and continuing support.

==Events==
The Oval hosts over 100,000 guests each year. Sporting events held there include bandy, ice hockey, speed skating, and recreational ice skating. In summer the Oval becomes the largest skating park in the Midwest, as ramps are put up for BMX biking, roller hockey, and aggressive skating. The track is used for inline skating, and a summer skateboard camp is held for beginning to intermediate skateboarders aged 6–13.
I.S.I.-certified ice skating lessons are given by Roseville Skating School in the connected Roseville Ice Arena during the winter months. The Oval also hosts two local speedskating clubs: 
the Greater Minnesota Speedskating Association and the Midway Speedskating Club. Midway Speedskating Club is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing speedskating skills in young skaters. It has produced Olympic athletes and coaches. A novice speedskating program is put on by the Midway Speedskating Club through the Roseville Parks and Recreation Department for youth aged 4–14.

February 25–27, 2015, the Bandy World Championship for girls up to 17 was organised here.

<doc id="1116847" wikidata="Q5012466" url="?curid=1116847" title="CKNW">
<text>CKNW (730 AM) is a radio station in Vancouver, British Columbia. Owned by Corus Entertainment, it broadcasts a talk radio format. Its offices and studios are in the TD Tower in Downtown Vancouver. 

CKNW is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for Canadian AM stations. It is unusual in that it is a Class A station but it broadcasts on a regional (not clear-channel) frequency. CKNW uses a directional antenna with a four-tower array to protect other stations on 730 AM from interference. Its transmitter is on Pacific Highway near the Serpentine River in Surrey.

The station originally broadcast on the frequency of 1230 kHz, before moving to 1320 kHz in 1949, and then 980 kHz in 1958. On June 26, 2024, as part of cuts by the company, Corus disbanded sister station CKGO&#x27;s traffic radio format, and began simulcasting CKNW&#x27;s programming on its 730 kHz frequency. In January 2025, Corus announced that CKNW would move permanently to CKGO&#x27;s signal on February 24, 2025, citing its better downtown and Lower Mainland coverage.

==Programming==
CKNW has local talk shows on weekday mornings and afternoons. Hosts include Simi Sara (&quot;Mornings With Simi&quot;), Mike Smyth (&quot;The Mike Smyth Show&quot;), Jill Bennett (&quot;The Jill Bennett Show&quot;) and Jas Johal (&quot;The Jas Johal Show&quot;). Nights feature talk shows syndicated across Canada from Ben Mulroney (&quot;The Ben Mulroney Show&quot;) and Ben O’Hara-Byrne (&quot;Conversations&quot;).

CKNW&#x27;s Global News department produces newscasts every hour. There are also weekday news blocks at 5 a.m. and on the weekends at 5.a.m and 6 p.m.

Mark Madryga is CKNW&#x27;s meteorologist. His weather reports can be heard during the morning news. Global BC&#x27;s Kristi Gordon is the substitute forecaster.

The station&#x27;s traffic department provides Vancouver traffic reports every 10 minutes on the 4s during morning and afternoon drive time and every half hour at other times.

== History ==
===Bill Rea ownership===
CKNW began in New Westminster, British Columbia. It signed on the air on . Its original frequency was 1230 kilocycles, under the ownership of Bill Rea&#x27;s International Broadcasting Company. It was the first in the region to provide hourly newscasts (between 6:00 a.m. and midnight) and the first in the province to broadcast 24 hours a day, beginning in 1947. It later became the Vancouver area&#x27;s first country station,

In 1947, Rea purchased a half-interest in Port Alberni radio station CJAV. Several personalities who started there would move to CKNW. These included Joe Chesney, who became morning show host until moving on to establish Langley station CJJC (now CKST in Vancouver) in 1963, and Jim Robson, who would provide play-by-play for the newly established Vancouver Canucks of the NHL beginning in 1970. 

On January 2, 1949, CKNW switched frequencies to 1320 AM and increased its power from 250 watts to 1,000. CKNW again increased its power to 5,000 watts on November 5, 1954. Jack Webster was an early host of a call-in talk show during his time with CKNW in the 1960s.

===WIC ownership===
In February 1956, Bill Rea began experiencing health problems. He sold CKNW to Frank Griffiths and the Allard family, who went on to form Western Broadcasting Company, which later became Western International Communications (WIC). In February 1958, long time Creative Director Tony Antonias wrote a jingle that was introduced on CKNW in April 1958. It was used across western Canada for years for the famous Woodward&#x27;s &quot;$1.49 Day&quot; sale (said aloud as &quot;dollar forty-nine day&quot;) on the first Tuesday of every month.

On November 17, 1958, the station switched to its present frequency of 980 AM. On February 22, 1960, its transmission power was increased to 10,000 watts, and it was further increased to 50,000 watts in 1965. On January 15, 1969, CKNW moved into larger studio space in a former Safeway store in New Westminster. 

CKNW added an FM station at 101.1 MHz with the call sign CFMI-FM. It signed on the air on . (Today, CFMI carries CKNW&#x27;s programming on its HD Radio subchannel.)

CKNW founder Bill Rea died on April 15, 1983, in Santa Barbara, California at age 74. On October 3, 1983, the station began broadcasting in AM stereo. 

===Western Information Network===
On June 18, 1984, it became the flagship station of the Western Information Network, broadcasting programs via satellite to affiliate stations throughout British Columbia. During the World&#x27;s Fair known as Expo 86, CKNW moved its Holiday Inn Hotel Talk studio to a new facility in the BC Pavilion Complex. CKNW broadcast on site for the duration of the fair. CKNW Talk programming aired from the Expo Studio until 1997.

In mid-December 1995, CKNW became the first commercial radio station in Canada to stream 24/7 over the internet.

During the 1990s, CKNW made a gradual transition from the mixed format of news, sports, talk shows and MOR music it had adopted in the 1960s to full-time news, talk and sports. In 1996, CKNW and CFMI moved again to their current studios in the TD Tower at Pacific Centre in Downtown Vancouver.

===Corus ownership===

In 2000, both CKNW and CFMI were purchased by Corus Entertainment as part of the splitting of WIC&#x27;s broadcasting assets; Corus acquired WIC&#x27;s radio stations and pay-TV assets while WIC&#x27;s broadcast TV stations, including CHAN-DT (BCTV, now Global BC) in the Vancouver area, were purchased by Canwest. Canwest ultimately went bankrupt in 2010, selling the bulk of its broadcast properties including Global BC to Corus sibling company Shaw Communications, which in turn transferred them to Corus in 2016.

In February 2001, Corus Entertainment launched an all-news sister station, NW2. This new station (CJNW AM730, formerly CKLG) was branded as &quot;24 hour news radio, powered by CKNW.&quot; NW2 shared newsroom resources with CKNW, including several anchors and reporters. However, NW2 did not achieve broad appeal, and was shut down in May 2002.

Since 2001, CKNW has gone through two significant restructurings focused on reducing costs, which resulted in dozens of lay-offs. Several senior reporters have left CKNW for other opportunities. The cost-cutting decisions made by Corus, along with the increase in infomercials, has correspondingly resulted in CKNW suffering a steady erosion of its listening audience.

In 2007, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council faulted CKNW for airing &quot;potentially dangerous information&quot; during the Dawson College shooting. During the incident, CKNW had simulcast content from its sister stations in Montreal which included students speaking by cellphone from inside the school. A Vancouver man complained that the content could have told the gunman where the students were. The council said that as a result of modern technology reducing geographic distance as a barrier, CKNW had breached Section 10 (coverage of violent situations) of the broadcast code. The station broadcast the decision as required, but did not air an apology and the station manager said it was a &quot;one-off situation&quot; that would not affect CKNW&#x27;s policies.

CKNW lost broadcast rights for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League to Team 1040 in 2004. The station had broadcast the games continuously since 1985. In 2006, CKNW lost the rights to broadcast Vancouver Canucks games to Team 1040 as well after broadcasting every one of the club&#x27;s games since their inaugural NHL season in 1970. The loss of the Canucks games may have resulted in the station losing nearly a third of their cumulative audience in the Fall ratings of 2006. 

In November 2015, CKNW&#x27;s programming was added to sister station 101.1 CFMI-FM&#x27;s HD Radio digital subchannel. It become the first AM station in British Columbia to broadcast on an HD subchannel.

On May 28, 2024, CKNW reacquired broadcast rights for the BC Lions, marking their return to CKNW after a 20-year absence.

=== Move to 730 ===
On June 26, 2024, sister station 730 CKGO switched from its previous all-traffic format to a simulcast of CKNW as the result of ongoing cuts by Corus. The company stated that the simulcast was an interim measure and that it would ultimately only operate one news-talk AM station in Vancouver, but did not announce at that time whether it intended to return CKGO&#x27;s license to the CRTC or sell the station. 

In January 2025, Corus announced that the CKNW intellectual unit, including its call letters and format, would move permanently to the 730 AM frequency on February 24, 2025. While both stations operate at the same power of 50 kilowatts, Corus stated that CKGO&#x27;s facilities were newer, and that its signal had better coverage in Downtown Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. The frequency swap mirrors a move made by Corus in Edmonton, where CHED relocated to the frequency of CHQT. After the frequency swap, 980 remains on the air to carry a looping promo advising listeners of the change, after which it is expected to go silent in mid-March.

== Former hosts and programs ==
Christy Clark hosted a weekday talk show on the station from 2007 to 2010, before returning to politics and becoming Premier of British Columbia. Her afternoon slot was taken over by Simi Sara. In 2020, Simi Sara moved to the morning slot, replacing Jon McComb.

Rafe Mair hosted a talk show on CKNW for 19 years, before being dismissed in 2003.

Dan Russell&#x27;s &quot;Sportstalk&quot; was the longest running sports discussion show in Canada but ended on CKNW in September 2013. The show was revived on CISL radio briefly, before ending on that station on May 1, 2014.

Long time radio broadcaster Bill Good retired after nearly 26 years with CKNW on August 1, 2014.

Sean Leslie once hosted CKNW&#x27;s weekend afternoon talk program (&quot;The Sean Leslie Show&quot;). 

Drex hosted the talk show &quot;Drex Live&quot; from 2014 to 2018, before expanding it into the nationally syndicated &quot;The Shift with Drex&quot; in 2018. After Drex left the show in 2020, it was taken over by Shane Hewitt, who hosted until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2023.

CKNW once aired an American syndicated overnight talk show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; and on weekends &quot;The Ted Radio Hour&quot;.

<doc id="1116864" wikidata="Q7046680" url="?curid=1116864" title="Nodens Ictus">
<text>Nodens Ictus are a British electronic music band formed in 1986 as a spinoff of British psychedelic rock band Ozric Tentacles.

==History==

Nodens Ictus began life in 1986 when Ozric Tentacles guitarist Ed Wynne and keyboardist Joie Hinton were asked by the promoters of the Crypt club in Deptford, South London, to produce an ambient set for the club&#x27;s &quot;chillout&quot; room.

Essentially Ozric Tentacles minus the guitar and rhythm section, Nodens Ictus explored ethereal, Tangerine Dream-like soundscapes using synths and samples, in contrast to the driving space-rock which characterised the sound of parent band. The limited-run, independent cassette-only album &quot;The Grove of Selves&quot; was issued in 1987 - sold initially at gigs and by mail order, it has subsequently become a rare and sought-after item of Ozric memorabilia.

Existing as a side-project only, Nodens Ictus played semi-frequently throughout the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s, often as a support act at Ozric shows. The band occasionally ventured into electronica/dance territory following the addition of Ozric drummer Merv Pepler to the lineup, until being put on the backburner for nearly a decade as Wynne focused on the increasingly commercially successful Ozrics. Pepler and Hinton meanwhile concentrated on their techno-trance act Eat Static, which had become successful enough in its own right for them to leave the Ozrics permanently in 1994.

Nodens Ictus returned in 2000 with the release of &quot;Spacelines&quot;, a collection of old and new studio tracks along with a handful of live cuts dating back as far as 1988. Released on the Ozrics&#x27; own Stretchy Records label, the album generated reasonable interest, and Nodens Ictus soon returned to the live arena, again as an occasional support act at Ozric gigs, most notably at their &quot;Pongmaster&#x27;s Ball&quot; extravaganzas held in London in 2002, 2004 and 2006. An appearance at the Glastonbury Festival was made in 2003, and Nodens Ictus continued with a pair of small-scale headline shows in Exeter and London in 2005.

2007 saw the band play at the Solfest in Cumbria, alongside Mixmaster Morris and System 7.

MantisMash joined the band as a touring member in 2014. Wynne&#x27;s son, Silas Neptune, joined the band as a full time member in 2017.

Nodens Ictus released their third album, &quot;The Cozmic Key&quot;, on 10 December 2017.

The double CD &quot;Live at Kozfest 2018&quot; was released in April 2019, as performed by Ed Wynne and Gre Vanderloo of Gracerooms. (They later collaborated on a studio album &quot;Floating through the Tumbliverse&quot;, but which was released under their own names.)

Note: There are a collection of recordings circulating on the internet called &quot;climbing trees and waterfalls&quot; (CTAW), which many people erroneously believe to have been recorded by Nodens Ictus. The CTAW recordings were in fact created by a collection of musicians from the Stoke-on-Trent area in the UK. Details are sketchy but information on early copies of the CTAW recordings list the band members as Mark - Guitar &amp; synth, Will - Drum programming, sampling &amp; mixing and Lance - Sampling, Occasional vocals. Definitely nothing whatsoever to do with Nodens Ictus.

<text>Jeffrey Kenneth MacNelly (September 17, 1947 – June 8, 2000) was an American editorial cartoonist and the creator of the comic strip &quot;Shoe&quot;. After &quot;Shoe&quot; had been established in papers, MacNelly created the single-panel strip &quot;Pluggers&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote: &quot;MacNelly&#x27;s superb draftsmanship as well as his heightened sense of the ridiculous is in the vanguard of a new generation of American cartoonists.&quot;

==Early life==
MacNelly was born in New York City in 1947 and grew up on Long Island. MacNelly&#x27;s mother was a retired journalist. His father, C.L. MacNelly, ran an advertising firm, and was the publisher of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; from 1964 to 1968.
MacNelly was educated in his teens at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts, where he was a class clown and decided to be an illustrator. 

He graduated in 1965 and went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He joined the literary society St. Anthony Hall and worked as a sports journalist and illustrator (specializing in satire) for &quot;The Daily Tar Heel&quot;. He considered himself to be a horrible sportswriter, but his illustrations for the paper were well beyond the ability of an average art student. His work for the college&#x27;s newspaper led to work at the &quot;Chapel Hill Weekly&quot;. MacNelly dropped out just shy of getting his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1970.

In 1969, MacNelly was commissioned to paint a representation of the Carolina Inn, which became an &quot;iconic&quot; image representing the Chapel Hill campus hotel and appeared on promotional brochures and menus issued by the inn in the ensuing decades. The painting mysteriously disappeared in the 1980s and resurfaced in Massachusetts in 2008, when it was returned to the Carolina Inn and presented to the public for the first time at an official unveiling in January 2009, attended by MacNelly&#x27;s son Danny.

==Career==
MacNelly got a job at the &quot;Chapel Hill Weekly&quot; during his years at school in UNC. He worked there for the editor who became his mentor, Jim &quot;Shu&quot; Shumaker, who was also a professor at UNC-Chapel Hill. Shumaker&#x27;s impression on the cartoonist was so profound that MacNelly created the comic strip &quot;Shoe&quot; after &quot;Shu,&quot; and the strip&#x27;s lead character is based upon him. MacNelly considered his two years at the Chapel Hill newspaper to be what led to his &quot;break&quot;; his cartoons were picked up by newspapers across the state.

By 1970, MacNelly had become such an accomplished artist that he was hired by Ross Mackenzie at &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot; in Richmond, Virginia to be the newspaper&#x27;s main illustrator and satirist. In less than two years, MacNelly won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1972, helping to put the small paper on the map. 

At this time, MacNelly was courted by various newspaper syndicates and journals to work for them, but he turned them down, preferring the slower pace of southern culture. In 1974, MacNelly was settling into being syndicated through the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, while making the South his home. MacNelly&#x27;s editorial page editor at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Jack Fuller, said in 1986 that MacNelly&#x27;s editorial cartoons were &quot;magic... I wish I could say just what combination of graphic mastery, writing skill and sheer perversity goes into Jeff&#x27;s work. I can&#x27;t, but when people say Jeff has a special perspective on the world, they are engaging in heroic understatement.&quot; 

In 1977, he launched his first comic strip, &quot;Shoe&quot;, which was an immediate success. In 1981, he quit as editorial cartoonist at the &quot;News-Leader&quot; to focus on &quot;Shoe&quot; full-time, but found he needed to work in a newspaper office atmosphere to concentrate. In the 1980s, MacNelly moved to Chicago (to work for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;) and eventually back to Virginia. &quot;Shoe&quot; was syndicated in 950 newspapers by 1986, with millions of readers. A line of stuffed animals based on the cartoon&#x27;s characters was produced. MacNelly also illustrated a book written by former Senator Eugene McCarthy and columnist James Kilpatrick, &quot;A Political Bestiary- Viable Alternatives, Impressive Mandates, and Other Fables&quot;.

MacNelly&#x27;s editorial cartoons often appeared in book collections. When MacNelly represented the Irish Republican Army as a leprechaun that was a rat in one of his &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; syndicated editorial cartoons after the IRA blew up a bus filled with schoolchildren, protesters objecting to the cartoon&#x27;s contents picketed outside the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;&#x27;s offices for three weeks. One of his most reprinted cartoons featured Mikhail Gorbachev with a birthmark in the shape of Afghanistan. MacNelly believed that in order to draw and write editorial cartoons, an artist had to have an opinion on the news, so he watched television news to gauge what other Americans were seeing and read the columns of Hugh Sidey, George Will and Meg Greenfield.

MacNelly said: &quot;Cartoons are really a negative art form. You never say anything nice. You&#x27;re always criticizing and dumping on people.&quot; Some of his most frequent targets were Jimmy Carter and Gorbachev. MacNelly was present when Gerald Ford fell and hit his head on a tarmac on an overseas trip in 1976: &quot;I was the only cartoonist to see that, to actually see it. And all I could think of was, &#x27;Gee, I hope he didn&#x27;t hurt his head.&#x27; Meanwhile, back in the States, all my colleagues were doing Jerry Ford-falling-down jokes, and Chevy Chase started an entire career on it. I never did one. And I was the only guy that was right there. I missed the whole story, the entire point of it and everything.&quot;

In 1988, the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; reported that a cartoonist for the Ohio Republican Party named Ed Wilson drew cartoons which were &quot;strikingly similar&quot; and &quot;virtually the same&quot; to MacNelly&#x27;s. The party subsequently fired Wilson.

In 1992, MacNelly met Chris Cassatt, a computer expert and cartoonist who became his assistant. Cassatt helped him change the way he worked by adding digitalization to his mediums. In 1992, MacNelly hired Cassatt full-time, and they tele-commuted between Fishhawk Pass in Virginia and Cassatt&#x27;s home in Aspen, Colorado. Also in 1993, on a suggestion from his wife Susie and long-time friend and Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, David Kennerly, MacNelly launched his strip &quot;Pluggers&quot;.

==Later career and legacy==
One of MacNelly&#x27;s friends and colleagues at the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot;, Gary Brookins, had assisted MacNelly in filling in doing finish work. Brookins was a fan of &quot;Pluggers&quot; and could replicate MacNelly&#x27;s style. Exhausted after his son&#x27;s death, MacNelly gave the strip to Brookins to take over in early 1997. &quot;Pluggers&quot; was produced by Brookins until 2020, after which it was handed over to Rick McKee; it is syndicated in more than 60 newspapers in the United States.

In the late 1990s, MacNelly began to also put more concentration into fine art painting and sculpture. He did a caricature of the Louisiana cartoonist Pap Dean. By 1999, he had almost finished passing the task of creating &quot;Shoe&quot; onto Cassatt, Susie MacNelly and Brookins. Then, in December 1999, MacNelly was diagnosed with lymphoma. He continued working in spite of his illness, producing &quot;Shoe&quot; and editorial cartoons and Dave Barry illustrations in his Johns Hopkins Hospital bed right up to the day he died, June 8, 2000.

MacNelly&#x27;s legacy is continued through the work of Chris Cassatt, Gary Brookins, Susie MacNelly, his head writer Bill Linden and Doug Gamble. This team keeps alive Jeff MacNelly&#x27;s work on &quot;Shoe&quot; and Dave Barry&#x27;s illustrations, as well as museum shows, fine art sales, licensing and publishing.

==Awards and honors==
MacNelly won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1972, a second Pulitzer in 1978, and a third Pulitzer in 1985.

He received a Reuben Award in 1978 and 1979.

MacNelly won &quot;Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year&quot; from the National Cartoonists Society in 1978 and 1979.

In 1977, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

MacNelly won the Thomas Nast Award in 1985. He also won a George Polk Award. 

He was the first cartoonist inducted into the UNC School of Journalism Hall of Fame in 1985. He said at the time of his induction: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid if my mother finds out, I&#x27;ll be in big trouble. She thinks I&#x27;m running numbers in Baltimore.&quot;

==Personal life==
MacNelly married his first wife, Rita Daniels, in 1970. His son Jake was born in 1972, followed by Danny in 1974. He divorced Rita in 1981. His second marriage, to Boo Goldstein, also ended in divorce.

<doc id="1116878" wikidata="Q365208" url="?curid=1116878" title="Adolfo Valencia">
<text>Adolfo José Valencia Mosquera (born 6 February 1968) is a Colombian retired footballer who played as a striker.

Nicknamed &quot;El tren&quot; (train) due to his powerful physique, he played in seven countries – having one-year spells in Germany and Spain&#x27;s top flight – and represented Colombia at two World Cups.

==Club career==
Born in Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca, Valencia started playing with Independiente Santa Fe, where his stellar performances earned him a transfer to Germany&#x27;s FC Bayern Munich. In his sole season (although he still played the first game of 1994–95), he was instrumental in helping the Bavarians clinch the Bundesliga title, and finished as the team&#x27;s top scorer alongside Mehmet Scholl, with 11 goals.

Valencia also played one season in Spain, with Atlético Madrid, where he was involved in a serious incident with irascible club president Jesús Gil, while vastly underperforming overall: after a La Liga match at CD Logroñés, the latter said that &quot;The black guy needs to have his throat cut&quot;. He subsequently went on to represent, without settling at any club, Independiente Santa Fe, América de Cali, A.C. Reggiana 1919, Independiente Medellín, PAOK FC, NY/NJ MetroStars, Zhejiang Lucheng F.C. and Unión Atlético Maracaibo.

While at Zhejiang, Valencia led the Chinese second division in scoring during the 2003 season. In his debut campaign in the Major League Soccer, he set a team record by scoring 16 league goals, and retired from football in 2004.

==International career==
Valencia made his debut for Colombia on 31 July 1992, scoring the only goal in a match against the United States at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the Friendship Cup, and proceeded to represent the nation at the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups. In the former edition he netted twice, in group stage defeats to Romania and the United States.

Alongside Bernardo Redín, Valencia was Colombia&#x27;s all-time topscorer in the World Cup. On 5 September 1993, he was one of three players on target in a 5–0 win in Argentina for the 1994 World Cup qualifiers.

===International goals===

Valencia&#x27;s son, José Adolfo, was also a footballer and a striker. He played mostly for Independiente Santa Fe, and represented Colombia at under-20 level.

<text>The term Nibelung (German) or Niflungr (Old Norse) is a personal or clan name with several competing and contradictory uses in Germanic heroic legend. It has an unclear etymology, but is often connected to the root &quot;Nebel&quot;, meaning mist. The term in its various meanings gives its name to the Middle High German heroic epic the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.

The most widespread use of Nibelung is used to denote the Burgundian royal house, also known as the Gibichungs (German) or Gjúkingar (Old Norse). A group of royal brothers led by king Gunther or Gunnar, the Gibichungs are responsible for the death of the hero Siegfried or Sigurd and are later destroyed at the court of Attila the Hun (called Etzel in German and Atli in Old Norse). This is the only use of the term attested in the Old Norse legends.

In medieval German, several other uses of the term Nibelung are documented besides the reference to the Gibichungs: it refers to the king and inhabitants of a mythical land inhabited by dwarfs and giants in the first half of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, as well as to the father and one of two brothers fighting over a divided inheritance. This land and its inhabitants give their name to the &quot;hoard of the Nibelungs&quot; (Middle High German &quot;der Nibelunge hort&quot;). In the late medieval &quot;Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid&quot;, the name, in the form Nybling or Nibling, is given to a dwarf who again gives his name to the treasure.

In Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (1848–1874), &quot;Nibelung&quot; denotes a dwarf, or perhaps a specific race of dwarfs.

==In &quot;Waltharius&quot;==
The earliest probable surviving mention of the name is in the Latin poem &quot;Waltharius&quot;, believed to have been composed around the year 920. In lines 555–6 of that poem Walter, seeing Guntharius (Gunther) and his men approaching says (in the &quot;Chronicon Novaliciense&quot; text, usually taken to be the oldest):
&quot;Nōn assunt Avarēs hīc, sed Francī Nivilōnēs,&quot;
&quot;cultōrēs regiōnis.&quot;
The translation is: &quot;These are not Avars, but Frankish Nivilons, inhabitants of the region.&quot; The other texts have &quot;nebulones&quot; &#x27;worthless fellows&#x27; instead of &quot;nivilones&quot;, a reasonable replacement for an obscure proper name. In medieval Latin names, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot; often interchange, so &quot;Nivilones&quot; is a reasonable Latinization of Germanic &quot;Nibilungos&quot;. This is the only text to connect the Nibelungs with Franks. Since Burgundy was conquered by the Franks in 534, Burgundians could loosely be considered Franks of a kind and confused with them. The name &quot;Nibelunc&quot; became a Frankish personal name in the 8th and 9th centuries, at least among the descendants of Childebrand I (who died in 752). Yet, in this poem, the center of Gunther&#x27;s supposedly Frankish kingdom is the city of Worms on the Rhine.

==Norse tradition==
In the eddic poem &quot;(see Poetic Edda)&quot; &quot;Atlakviða&quot;, the word &quot;Niflungar&quot; is applied three times to the treasure (&quot;arfr&quot;) or hoard (&quot;hodd&quot;) of Gunnar (the Norse counterpart of German Gunther). It is also applied once to Gunnar&#x27;s warriors and once to Gunnar himself. It elsewhere appears unambiguously as the name of the lineage to which the brothers Gunnar and Högni (&quot;Hǫgni&quot;) belong and seems mostly interchangeable with Gjúkingar or Gjúkungar, meaning descendants of Gjúki, Gjúki being Gunnar&#x27;s father.

The variant form &quot;Hniflungr&quot; also occurs as the name of Högni&#x27;s son in the eddic poem &quot;Atlamál&quot;, and as a term for the children born by Gunnar&#x27;s sister Gudrún (&quot;Guðrún&quot;) to Atli (Attila the Hun). It appears to be a general term for &quot;warrior&quot; in &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;. &quot;Hniflungar&quot; might be of separate origin, meaning descendants of Hnef, referring to the Hnæf son of Hoc who is prominent in the Old English &quot;Finnesburg Fragment&quot;. However &quot;h&quot; was early dropped initially before other consonants in Norwegian dialects which might have led to the adding of &quot;h&quot; to names in other dialects where it did not originally belong.

==Niblung genealogy==
===&quot;Lex Burgundionum&quot;===
In the &quot;Lex Burgundionum&quot;, issued by the Burgundian king Gundobad (c. 480–516), it is decreed that those who were free under the kings Gibica, Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundaharius will remain free. But as will be seen below, legendary tradition often makes Gibiche or Gjúki (that is Gibica) the father of Gunther/Gunnar and names Giselher (the same name as Gislaharius) as one of Gunther/Gunnar&#x27;s brothers. In Norse tradition another brother is named Gutthorm (&quot;Gutþormr&quot;) which looks like a slight garbling of Gundomar. German tradition provides instead a third brother named Gernot, which may be a substitution of a more familiar name for an unfamiliar one. In the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, all three brothers are called kings. If these legends preserve authentic tradition, then historically Gibica of the &quot;Burgundian Laws&quot; might have been the father of the three kings Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundaharius who shared the kingdom among them, presumably with Gundaharius as the high king (the sharing of the throne between brothers was a common tradition among the Germanic tribes, see Germanic king). But if so, the order of the names here is puzzling. One would expect Gundaharius to be named immediately after Gibica.

===German tradition===
In the Waltharius King Gibicho of the Franks is father of Guntharius, that is Gunther, and both father and son are called kings of the Franks, not kings of the Burgundians, though their city is Worms on the Rhine. Another king called Heriricus rules the Burgundians and is father of Hiltgunt, the heroine of the tale. The only other kinsman of Gunther who appears here is Hagano (Hagen). But Hagano&#x27;s exact familial relation to Guntharius is not given.

The Old Norse &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot; is a medieval translation of German legendary material into Norwegian. Here Gunther (given the Old Norse form &quot;Gunnar&quot;) and his brothers are sons and heirs of Irung (in one place) or Aldrian (elsewhere) by Aldrian&#x27;s wife Ode. The sons are named Gunnar, Gernoz, and Gisler. Ode also bears a daughter named Grímhild. One later passage adds Guthorm. But Guthorm is never mentioned again and is possibly an addition from Norse tradition by the translator or by an early copyist. Hǫgni (German Hagen) appears as their maternal half-brother, fathered on Ode by an elf when Ode once fell asleep in the garden while her husband was drunk. Yet one passage names Hǫgni&#x27;s father as Aldrian. There are confusions and doublings in the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot; and it may be that Aldrian was properly the name of Hǫgni&#x27;s elf father. Gunnar and his legitimate brothers are often called Niflungar and their country is named Niflungaland. Their sister Grímhild bore to Atli (Attila) a son named Aldrian who is slain by Hǫgni. At the end of the resultant battle, Hǫgni, though mortally wounded, fathered a son on Herad, one of Þiðrek&#x27;s relations. This son, named Aldrian, accomplished Atli&#x27;s death and became Jarl of Niflungaland under Brynhild (&quot;Brynhildr&quot;). In the Faroese &quot;Hǫgnatáttur&quot; a similar tale is told. Here Gunnar and Hǫgni have two younger brothers named Gislar and Hjarnar, both slain along with their elder brothers. Hǫgni lies with a Jarl&#x27;s daughter named Helvik on his deathbed and prophecies to Helvik that a son born to her will avenge him. The son in this account is named Högni. On the birth of the child, Helvik, following Hǫgni&#x27;s advice, secretly exchanged it with a newborn child of &quot;Gudrún&quot; and &quot;Artala&quot;. As a result, Gudrún slew the supposed child of Hǫgni, thinking to have put an end to Hǫgni&#x27;s lineage, but in fact killed her own child and then brought up Hǫgni&#x27;s child as her own. This second Hǫgni learned of his true parentage and took vengeance on Artala as in the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot;.

In the Nibelungenlied and its dependent poems the &quot;Klage&quot; and &quot;Biterolf&quot;, the father of Gunther, Gernot, Giselher, and Kriemhild is named Dankrat and their mother is named Uote. Hagen is their kinsman (exact relationship not given), and has a brother named Dancwart whose personality is bright and cheerful in contrast to Hagen&#x27;s. Hagen also has a sister&#x27;s son named Ortwin of Metz. These family relationships might seem to prohibit any elvish siring, but in the cognate story of Brân the Blessed in &quot;Branwen ferch Llŷr&quot;, Hagen&#x27;s counterpart Efnisien had a brother named Nisien who was similarly his opposite and Efnisien and Nisien are maternal half-brothers to Brân and Manawyddan just as in the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot;, Hǫgni was maternal brother to Gunnar and Gernoz. In the second half of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; both Hagen and Dankwart are called sons of Aldrian. Nothing further is told of Aldrian here. Also in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, Gunther and Brunhild had a son named Siegfried and Siegfried and Kriemhild had a son named Gunther. Kriemhild&#x27;s later son born to Etzel (= Attila) who is slain by Hagen is here named Ortlieb. The &quot;Klage&quot; relates that Gunther&#x27;s son Siegfried inherited the kingdom.

===Norse tradition===
The &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; names the founder of the Niflung lineage as &quot;Nefi&quot;, one of the second set of nine sons of Halfdan the Old who founded many famous legendary lineages. The &quot;Ættartolur&quot; (genealogies attached to the &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;) call this son of Halfdan by the name Næfil (&quot;Næfill&quot;) and relate that King Næfil was father of Heimar, father of Eynef (&quot;Eynefr&quot;), father of Rakni, father of Gjúki.

The form &quot;Gjúki&quot; is etymologically equatable to Gebicca of the &quot;Lex Burgundionum&quot;. According to the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; and the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;, Gjúki was father of two sons named Gunnar (&quot;Gunnarr&quot;) and Högni (&quot;Hǫgni&quot;) and of two daughters named Gudrún (&quot;Guðrún&quot;) and Gullrönd. Their mother was named Grímhild (&quot;Grímhildr&quot;). Gudný is mentioned in no other extant texts. A younger brother named Gutthorm (&quot;Gutþormr&quot;) take on the role of Sigurd&#x27;s slayer, after being egged on by Gunnar and Högni in the eddic poems &quot;Brot af Sigurðarkviðu&quot; (stanza 4), in &quot;Sigurðarkviða hin skamma&quot; (stanzas 20–23), and in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; (as well as being mentioned in the eddic poems &quot;Grípisspá&quot; and &quot;Guðrúnarkviða II&quot;). According to the eddic poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, stanza 27:

If Gotthorm or Gutthorm, the slayer of Sigurd in northern tradition, is brother of Gunnar and Högni, but is not a son of Gjúki, he must be a maternal half-brother, just as Hagen, the slayer of Siegfried in the German tradition, is a maternal half-brother in the &quot;Thidreks saga&quot;.

Gudrún bore to Sigurd a son named Sigmund according to the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, presumably the same as the unnamed son mentioned in stanza 5 of &quot;Sigurdarkvida hin skamma&quot;. But nothing more is said of him. More often mentioned is Gudrún&#x27;s daughter named Svanhild (&quot;Svanhildr&quot;) who became the wife of Jörmunrek (&quot;Jǫrmunrekr&quot;). By her third husband Jónakr, Gudrún is mother of Hamdir (&quot;Hamðir&quot;) and Sörli (&quot;Sǫrli&quot;). In the eddic poems &quot;Guðrúnarhvöt&quot; and &quot;Hamðismál&quot;, Erp (&quot;Erpr&quot;), a third son of Jónakr, was born by a different mother. But in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; and the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; Erp is also a son of Gudrún.

In the &quot;Atlakviða&quot; (stanza 12), a son of Högni says farewell to his father as Gunnar and Högni depart to visit Atli. The &quot;Atlamál&quot; (stanza 28) brings in two sons of Högni by his wife Kostbera, named Snævar (&quot;Snævarr&quot;) and Sólar (&quot;Sólarr&quot;). They accompany their father and uncle on their fateful journey to Atli&#x27;s court where they also meet their deaths. These sons are also mentioned in the prose introduction to the eddic poem &quot;Dráp Niflunga&quot; along with a third son Gjúki. The &quot;Atlamál&quot; later introduces another son of Högni (or possibly Gjúki son of Högni under another name) who, along with Gudrún, kills Atli. In the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; this son is named Niflung (&quot;Niflungr&quot;). He may be a reflex of the posthumous son of Högni who is called Aldrian in the &quot;Thidreks saga&quot;. The Danish &quot;Hven Chronicle&quot; also tells the story of Högni&#x27;s posthumous son begotten as Högni is dying, of the switching of children so that Högni is brought up as son of Atli and &quot;Gremhild&quot;, and of how this son lures Gremhild to the cave of treasure and seals her in.

==Other interpretations of &quot;Nibelung&quot;==
===A northern people===
Although &quot;Nibelungs&quot; refers to the royal family of the Burgundians in the second half of the &quot;Nibelunglenlied&quot; (as well as in many other texts), in the first half Nibelungenlant it is instead a kingdom on the borders of Norway of which Siegfried becomes the ruler.

In Adventure 3 Hagen tells how Siegfried came by chance upon the two sons of the king of the Nibelungs who had just died. Their names were Schilbung and Nibelung and they were attempting to divide their father&#x27;s hoard, the hoard of the Nibelungs. They asked Siegfried to make the division for them. For a reason not explained, Siegfried was unable to make the division, despite much effort. Fighting broke out and Siegfried slew Schilbung, Nibelung, twelve giants, and seven hundred warriors, at which point those still alive, not unreasonably, surrendered and took Siegfried as their king. In this way, Siegfried gained the Nibelung treasure, though he still had to fight the dwarf Alberich, whom he defeated and made guardian of the hoard. We are to presume that when the treasure passed to the Burgundian kings after Siegfried&#x27;s death, the name &quot;Nibelung&quot; went with it.

It is a common folklore motif that the protagonist comes upon two or three persons or creatures quarreling about a division of treasure or magical objects among themselves, that they ask the protagonist to make the division for them, and that in the end it is the protagonist who ends up as owner of the treasure. Schilbung and Niblung are otherwise unknown. It may be coincidence that in the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;, Skelfir ancestor of the Skilfings and Næfil ancestor of the Niflungs (Nibelungs) are brothers, though there they are two of nine brothers.

=== Referring to dwarfs ===
In a later poem &quot;Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid&quot; (&#x27;The Song of Horny-skinned Siegfried&#x27;), known only from 16th century printed versions, the original owner of the hoard is a dwarf named Nibeling (or Nyblung). Siegfried happened to find it one day and bore it away. At Worms Siegfried met King Gybich, his three sons Gunther, Hagen, and Gyrnot, and his daughter Kriemhild. When Kriemhild was abducted by a dragon, Siegfried rescued her and was given her hand in marriage.

This variant usage of Niblung may arise from the identification of the hoard of the Burgundians, or at least most of it, with the hoard of treasure won by Siegfried. The German versions of the tale make much of Kriemhild&#x27;s right to the &quot;Nibelungen&quot; treasure through her previous marriage to Siegfried. Some seemingly took &quot;Nibelung&quot; to apply primarily to Siegfried&#x27;s treasure, in which case it must mean something else than the Burgundian royal family, and so another explanation was contrived.

The alternate theory is that the connection with the treasure was indeed primary, and that &quot;nibel-&quot;, &quot;nifl-&quot;, meaning &#x27;mist, cloud&#x27;, referred originally to a dwarfish origin for the hoard, though this was later forgotten and the application of the name to the Burgundian royal family arose from misunderstanding. In the first half of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, Siegfried&#x27;s last fight to win the treasure is against the dwarf Alberich. In &quot;Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfried&quot; the treasure belonged to the dwarf Nybling. Though the kings of the Nibelungs named Schilbung and Nibelung in the first half of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; are humans as far as is told, it would not be impossible that in earlier tradition they were explicitly dwarfs like Alberich. The people of the Nibelungs also have giants in their service, perhaps an indication of their earlier supernatural stature. In the Norse tales the hoard originates from a dwarf named Andvari, thence passes to Odin, and then to Hreidmar (&quot;Hreiðmarr&quot;), and then to Hreidmar&#x27;s son Fáfnir who changes into dragon form, and from him to Sigurd (Siegfried).

Niflheim (&quot;Mist-home&quot;) is a mythical region of cold and mist and darkness in the north. &quot;Niflhel&quot; is a term for part or all of Hel, the land of the dead. As dwarfs are subterranean creatures in these tales, who live in darkness, &quot;Niflung&quot; would seem a reasonable name for these beings, an old name forgotten in the north and only preserved in the garblings of some German accounts of the origin of the Niblung hoard. In &quot;Silver Fir Cones&quot;, one of the tales found in Otmar&#x27;s &quot;Volkssagen (Traditions of the Harz)&quot; (Bremen, 1800), the king of the dwarfs is named Gübich.

It cannot be proved which meaning was primary, that of dwarf or Burgundian prince. Scholars today mostly believe that the Burgundian connection is the more original one. In the 19th century, the dwarf theory was popular and was adopted by Richard Wagner for his operatic &quot;Ring cycle&quot; which was very freely adapted from the tales surrounding Siegfried and the Burgundians. In Wagner&#x27;s operas &quot;Nibelungs&quot; refers to the race of dwarfs.

==Theories of etymology and origins==
Several different etymologies of the term &quot;Nibelung&quot; have been proposed; they are usually connected to a specific theory of the original nature of the name: referring originally to mythical beings, to the Franks, or to the Burgundians.

===Referring to mythical beings===
Andreas Heusler and many other scholars have derived the name &quot;Nibelung&quot; from the root &quot;*nebula-&quot;, meaning cloud, mist, or fog, or &quot;*nibila-&quot;, meaning low, deep, or dark (cf. Niflheim). This derivation frequently assumes that the name originally referred to mythological beings and means something to the effect of &quot;beings of mist&quot;. Heusler reasoned that the name became attached to the various possessors of the Nibelungs&#x27; treasure and thereby passed from the mythical beings, to Siegfried, and then to the Burgundians in the &quot;Nibelungenlied.

Stefan Schaffner proposes another theory: again assuming that &quot;Nibelung&quot; originally referred to mythical beings, instead derives the name from a root &quot;*nibla-&quot; or &quot;*nibula-&quot; meaning &quot;being below&quot;, which Schaffner connects to Niflheim.

Whatever the actual derivation of the name &quot;Nibelung&quot;, it is clear that it was interpreted as being connected to the word &quot;nebel&quot; (mist, fog), and that the form of the word was likely altered via this association. A clear example can be seen in the name of the dwarf Nybling from &quot;Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid&quot;, which was translated into Czech as &quot;Mhaček&quot;, from Czech &quot;mha&quot; (mist). In the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, the name of Nibelung&#x27;s brother, &quot;Schilbung&quot;, has similarly been suggested to have a meaning &quot;rock- or cave-man&quot; or &quot;frost-man&quot;, meaning that Nibelung&#x27;s name may similarly have been interpreted as &quot;mist-man&quot;.

===Referring to the Nibelungid branch of the Frankish Pippinid dynasty===
George Gillespie presents the theory that the name &quot;Nibelung&quot; originally applied to the Nibelungid cadet branch of the Pippinid dynasty of Frankish mayors of the palace, the later Carolingian emperors. The name is first recorded in 752 in Latin as &quot;Nibelungus&quot; or &quot;Nivelongus&quot;, referring to a nephew of Charles Martel. The name is also recorded as belonging to several other members of a cadet branch of the dynasty descending from Charles&#x27;s brother Childebrand I; this cadet branch is known as the Nibelungids or Nibelungs. A reference to &quot;nebulones Franci&quot; (translated as &quot;Nibelungian Franks&quot;) in the &quot;Waltharius&quot; is used as further evidence, though this translation of the epithet &quot;nebulones&quot; is disputed.

Gillespie and C. W. von Sydow argue the name may derive from Nivelles in Walloon Brabant, where the Pippinids founded a monastery and maintained strong connections. The name &quot;Nivelles&quot; either derives from the Germanic &quot;*Niuwa-alha&quot;, meaning new sanctuary, or from a Celtic toponym.

According to this theory, the name &quot;Nibelung&quot; came to be attached to the Burgundian royal house after the Kingdom of Burgundy in southern France was absorbed into the Frankish kingdom in 613 and came under the rule of the Frankish Nibelungids. Rejecting a Burgundian origin for the name, Gillespie further notes that Gunther is recorded in Old English as &quot;Gūðhere&quot;, but is referred to as a Burgundian rather than a &quot;Nibelung&quot;, a name which is unattested in Old English.

===Referring to a Burgundian clan===
Ursula Dronke and Helmmut Rosenfeld argue that the name &quot;Nibelung&quot; originally referred to a Burgundian clan. They note the existence of several place names in Savoy, the location of the French kingdom of Burgundy, which can be derived from a reconstructed &quot;Nibilungos&quot;, including &quot;Neblens&quot;, &quot;Noblens&quot;, and &quot;Neublans&quot;.

Dronke argues that after the resettlement of the Burgundians from the Rhine to the Kingdom of Burgundy in 411, the clan name &quot;Nibelung&quot; was transferred to the Burgundian royal dynasty of the Gibichings (Old Norse &quot;Gjúkingar&quot;). It was then afterwards adopted by the Franks, who came to identify the Gibichungs as Franks as well, as in the &quot;Waltharius&quot;. Rosenfeld, on the other hand, argues that the Burgundian clan name &quot;Nibelung&quot; was adopted by the Nibelungid cadet branch of the Frankish Pippinid dynasty once Charles Martell&#x27;s brother Childebrand I and his descendants came to rule the former Burgundian kingdom as counts. The royal name &quot;Gibichung&quot; was then replaced in the heroic tradition with &quot;Nibelung&quot; in order to connect this Frankish cadet branch to the Burgundian royal dynasty.

Dronke subscribes to the traditional scholarly derivation of the name &quot;Nibelung&quot; from &quot;nibel&quot; or &quot;nebel&quot;, meaning cloud or darkness. She notes that other Burgundian clan names are recorded with similar associations: &quot;Wulkingos&quot;, from &quot;wolkan&quot;, cloud; &quot;Dagilingos&quot;, deriving from day; &quot;Leuhtingos&quot;, deriving from light; and &quot;Sauilingos&quot;, deriving from &quot;sol&quot;, meaning sun.

Rosenfeld derives the name instead from a name &quot;*Niwilo&quot;, which is a nickname for the name &quot;*Niuw-man&quot; (literally &quot;new-man&quot;). &quot;Nibelung&quot; would be the patronymic of this name, with the change from &quot;w&quot; to &quot;b&quot; showing Romance influence.

<doc id="1116900" wikidata="Q715643" url="?curid=1116900" title="George H. Kerr">
<text>George Henry Kerr (; November 7, 1911 – August 27, 1992), was a United States diplomat during World War II, and in later years he was a writer and an academic. His published works and archived papers cover &quot;economic and political affairs in Taiwan in the 1930s and 1940s, Taiwan&#x27;s transition from Japanese rule before and during World War II to postwar Chinese rule, Taiwanese rebellion against Chinese rule in 1947, and U.S. foreign policy toward Taiwan.&quot; His works also include &quot;information about economic and political conditions in Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands after World War II.&quot;

==Early life==
Kerr was born in Pennsylvania. He was a student in Japan during 1935 through 1937; and he was an English teacher in Taihoku, Japanese Taiwan, during 1937 through 1940.

==Military career==
As a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve, Kerr worked for the U.S. Navy as a Taiwan expert and instructed future military government officers during the Pacific War. In 1942–1943, Kerr was an analyst and consultant on Formosa in the U.S. Department of War. In 1944–1946, he was the director of the Formosa Research Unit at the Naval School of Military Government and Administration for the U.S. Navy at Columbia University in New York.

==Diplomatic career==
After the war, Kerr returned to Taiwan in 1945 as an assistant naval attaché, escorting the newly appointed Chinese Governor-General Chen Yi to the Japanese surrender of Taiwan on 25 October 1945 (Retrocession Day). Kerr was present in his official capacity as a civil affairs officer of the U.S. Navy Attache&#x27;s Office to the Republic of China government in Chongqing. Later, he became a diplomat at the U.S. embassy in China. He was a Foreign Service staff officer and vice-consul in Taipei. He has written about his eyewitness account of the February 28 Incident in 1947.

It was not till the early 1950s that he realized his wish to visit Okinawa, and with it a military commission to write a history, the purpose of which was to revive an independent Ryūkyūan identity. An able team of researcher-translators scoured Japan for historical sources on Okinawa. Then Kerr synthesized the material into the book &quot;Okinawa: Kingdom and Province&quot; (1953), and then in Japanese as &quot;Ryūkyū no rekishi&quot; (1955). In the meantime, Kerr began a revision based on additional research as well as criticism of the first two books and published a 1958 volume, &quot;Okinawa: The History of an Island People.&quot;

==Academic career==
Kerr was a lecturer at the University of Washington during 1947–1949; and he was a lecturer at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley in 1949–1950. For the next five years, he was a research associate at the Hoover Institution.

The open sections of Kerr&#x27;s papers are available at the Okinawa Prefectural Archives in Haebaru, others at the Stanford, Taipei and Ryudai libraries.

==Later life==
Kerr&#x27;s publications on Taiwan are numerous. He championed the cause of Taiwan independence from China, thereby making himself a high-profile enemy to both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong. (Chiang complained and Kerr lost his job at Stanford University.) He also drafted a long book on 19th century Hawaii, thus making his life&#x27;s work of a piece: &quot;the history of Pacific Ocean marine frontiers&quot;.

He is an author of many books and of numerous articles concerning Japan, Okinawa and Taiwan. Among them are the &quot;Formosa: Licensed Revolution and the Home Rule Movement, 1895-1945&quot;, &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot; (1965), &quot;Descriptive Summary: George H. Kerr papers, 1943-1951&quot;, &quot;Okinawa: The History of an Island People&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Taiwan Confrontation Crisis&quot; (1986).

&quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot; was one of the most influential books about Taiwan&#x27;s transition from Japanese colonial rule to the rule of the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party) administration. George Kerr was working for the American Foreign Service at the time of the transition and was present in Taiwan for the KMT occupation and resulting aftermath. &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot; made a sharp rebuke of the Nationalist administration and made arguments in favor of Taiwanese independence. The book was republished in 1976 by Da Capo Press. In 1992 a second edition was published by Taiwan Publishing Co. The book is now legally available online (&quot;see link below&quot;).

&quot;Okinawa: The History of an Island People&quot; covers the legendary past to the Battle of Okinawa in 542 very read-able pages. Eleven years before he died, Kerr wrote that 13,000 copies had been sold. The book was out of print for a time, but Tuttle, the original publishers, reprinted it in 2000, adding a new introduction and an appendix by Okinawa history scholar Mitsugu Sakihara.

He died at the age of 80 on August 27, 1992, in Honolulu, Hawaii.

<doc id="1116901" wikidata="Q6790882" url="?curid=1116901" title="Matthew Lloyd">
<text>Matthew James Lloyd (born 16 April 1978) is a former professional Australian rules footballer, who played for the Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

A highly decorated full-forward, Lloyd&#x27;s AFL&#x27;s honours include being the eighth all-time leading goalkicker in the history of AFL/VFL, including three Coleman Medals as leading goalkicker in the league; AFL life membership; and winning both the Mark of the Year and Goal of the Year awards. Among his representative honours are five All-Australian selections, three times representing the Victoria State of Origin team, as well as twice representing Australia in International rules football.

Lloyd has kicked over 100 goals in a season twice. He also belongs to the relatively small group of players whose first kick in the AFL resulted in a goal. With 926 goals from 270 games, he holds the record for the most career goals at Essendon, including winning the leading goalkicker award 12 times—five more times than any other Bomber. Upon his retirement, the award was renamed the Matthew Lloyd Medal in his honour.

==Early life==
Matthew Lloyd was born in Melbourne in 1978 to parents John (a former VFL footballer who played 29 games for the Carlton Football Club from 1965–1967) and Bev Lloyd. The Lloyds moved to Scotland for three years because of John&#x27;s work, and it was there that Matthew picked up rugby and soccer playing for his Currie club.

Lloyd attended St Martin De Porres Parish Primary School in Avondale Heights before moving to St. Bernard&#x27;s College in Essendon. He played junior football for Avondale Heights Football Club in the Essendon District Football League.

He supported the Fitzroy Football Club when he was young because in the first game he attended, Fitzroy player Bernie Quinlan kicked nine goals.

==Career==

===AFL===
Lloyd was drafted into the AFL as a 16-year-old in the 1995 Pre-season Draft as a &quot;compensatory selection&quot; that was awarded to Essendon by the AFL in return for losing Todd Ridley to the newly formed Fremantle Football Club. The Bombers picked up what would be one of their all-time greats for a relative pittance in the draft. Lloyd was heralded as a future football star after his AFL debut in Round 14, 1995, where he scored a goal with his first kick in league football and three for the match.

The key features of Lloyd&#x27;s game were his powerful marks on the lead (particularly overhead), his use of his body in a defensive capacity and accurate goal kicking, particularly from set shots on his left foot. He converted a large majority of set shots inside the 50-metre arc and kicked further than 50 metres on a regular basis.

Lloyd was known for his ritual when taking set shots at goal. Almost every time, he took time to go far back on the mark, pull both his socks up, and then grab some grass and throw it into the air to measure the wind and take a very long run-up before kicking; this was his method of following advice given to him by coaches to bring down his heart rate in order to focus better. In 2006, the AFL introduced a &quot;shot clock&quot; to limit the amount of time that players had to take set shots; although Lloyd&#x27;s ritual was not the longest in the league, its quirks made it so well known that the rule became commonly known as the &quot;Lloyd Rule&quot;. Lloyd adjusted his ritual to fit into the new rule, and he still retained the most famous aspect (throwing grass) until the end of his career.

Lloyd&#x27;s goal-scoring ability enabled him to top the Essendon goal scoring every year from 1997 to 2009, except for 2006 when he only played three games due to a serious hamstring injury.

Lloyd was selected in the All-Australian team on five occasions (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003), won the Coleman Medal for kicking the most goals in the regular season three times (2000, 2001 and 2003) and twice kicked more than 100 goals in a completed season (109 in 2000 and 105 in 2001; on both occasions he reached the milestone during the finals).

Lloyd was a member of Essendon&#x27;s 2000 premiership team and was captain of Essendon from 2006 to 2009. He was recognised for his achievements at Essendon in 2002 when he was ranked the 22nd-greatest player ever to play for the club in the &quot;Champions of Essendon&quot; list.

Lloyd was appointed Essendon captain ahead of the 2006 season after James Hird elected to stand down following the side&#x27;s disappointing 2005 season. Lloyd&#x27;s first match as Essendon captain resulted in a 27-point win over the defending premiers Sydney, where he kicked eight goals (six of them in the first quarter alone). It would be the only win that Essendon would enjoy under Lloyd&#x27;s captaincy until exactly a year later.

In addition to serving as captain and earning life membership at Essendon, Lloyd is also the team&#x27;s all-time-highest goal scorer. 

In 2013, Lloyd was inducted as a member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame and as a Legend in the Essendon Football Club Hall of Fame.

===State of Origin===
Lloyd had a successful State of Origin career, kicking 8 goals in 3 games. He first played for Victoria in 1997, against South Australia, kicking 3 goals, including a snap kick along the ground from near the boundary line, which went one way and then curved back another. In 1998, Lloyd kicked two goals against The Allies, in Brisbane. Lloyd last played for Victoria in 1999 against South Australia in the second-last-ever State of Origin game, kicking 3 goals and being named in the best players.

==Career highlights==
In Round 20, 2007, Lloyd kicked a backheel goal whilst surrounded by opponents and was awarded the 2007 Goal of the Year.

In Round 18 against the Melbourne Demons, Lloyd took a spectacular mark above five players to win the 2008 Mark of the Year. Immediately after the mark, Lloyd recalled in a 2022 episode of &quot;The Sunday Footy Show&quot; that he roasted his opponent Matthew Warnock afterwards:

&quot;You&#x27;ve always wanted to be on a footy card; now you&#x27;ll probably be on one.&quot;

A haul of eight goals in that match gave Lloyd his best return since Round 1, 2006.

===Performances against the Sydney Swans===
In Round 3, 1999, Lloyd, aged just 21 at the time, kicked a record 13 goals against the Sydney Swans at the MCG, kicking the first goal of the game and breaking John Coleman&#x27;s record for most goals kicked by an Essendon player against the Swans.

In his first game as Essendon captain, also playing against the Sydney Swans, Lloyd kicked eight goals (six in the first quarter against his opponent, Leo Barry) He kicked a total of 69 goals playing against the Swans throughout his career.

==Injuries==
During Essendon&#x27;s 1996 preliminary final against the Sydney Swans in Sydney, Lloyd ruptured his spleen in the second quarter. He suffered a large amount of blood loss and spent 10 days in intensive care in a Sydney hospital.

In Round 6, 2002, against Fremantle, Lloyd ruptured a tendon in his right ring finger when it was caught in his opponent&#x27;s guernsey. It required surgery to be reattached, and he was out for eight weeks.

Lloyd returned in Round 14 against the Western Bulldogs when Steven Kretiuk controversially targeted his injured hand.

Midway through the third quarter of the Essendon vs. Western Bulldogs match on 16 April 2006 (which happened to be Lloyd&#x27;s 28th birthday), opponent Brian Harris accidentally fell on Lloyd as he tried to mark the ball. Lloyd walked off the ground with the aid of trainers and did not return for the rest of the match. Following scans, a week later it was revealed that the hamstring tendon had been snapped off the bone. Surgery to repair the career-threatening injury took place, which ruled him out for the rest of the season. Lloyd&#x27;s absence from the team was felt hard, as the Bombers, despite high expectations, finished 15th on the ladder at season&#x27;s end with a final win-loss record of 3–1–18. As Lloyd was captain of Essendon and was unable to play for the remainder of the season (his first year of captaincy, in fact), David Hille was promoted to team captain in Lloyd&#x27;s absence.

Lloyd made a successful comeback against Adelaide at AAMI Stadium in Round 1, 2007. He kicked two goals while working further up the ground, putting to rest any concerns about his injured hamstring. Essendon beat Adelaide by 31 points.

==Brad Sewell incident==
In Round 22, 2009, Lloyd hit Hawthorn player Brad Sewell with a heavy bump that left him unconscious and with facial injuries, and it led to a brawl between the two teams. The Essendon–Hawthorn rivalry is fierce, first reaching a flashpoint in the 1980s and peaking in the infamous Line in the Sand Match in 2004. In the bitter aftermath of the 2009 match in which four players were suspended for a total of seven matches and $27,000 in fines were handed out, Hawthorn&#x27;s Campbell Brown called Lloyd &quot;one of the biggest snipers in the game&quot; and said that &quot;his time is coming&quot;. Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson threatened Lloyd and abused an interchange steward and had to be restrained by Hawthorn football manager Mark Evans as the teams left the field. AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou defended Lloyd&#x27;s reputation; Clarkson was fined for his comments and later apologised for the outburst.

Essendon went on to win the match by 17 points after trailing by 22 points at the time of the incident, and in the week after the match, Lloyd was given a six-match suspension by the match review panel for the hit on Sewell. This was reduced to four matches after he decided not to appeal the sanction. Lloyd only served one match of his suspension, missing Essendon&#x27;s 96-point elimination final loss to at AAMI Stadium, before announcing his retirement on 23 September 2009.

==Retirement==
On 23 September 2009, Lloyd announced his retirement to a packed media conference at the Essendon Football Club Hall of Fame. Although he had been offered another contract, Lloyd said that &quot;now is my time from a physical and mental point of view&quot; and that he would &quot;...prefer to go a year too early than a year too late.&quot;

To celebrate Lloyd&#x27;s career, the Coventry End of Docklands Stadium is renamed the Lloyd End for Essendon home games.

In 2009, Lloyd was appointed assistant coach at the AIS-AFL Academy; however, he ruled out applying for an AFL coaching position.

==Media work==
Lloyd co-hosted children&#x27;s AFL show &quot;Auskick&#x27;n Around&quot; on Fox Footy Channel with Brad Johnson from the Western Bulldogs from 2003 until it was cancelled at the end of 2005.

In 2006, Lloyd had a weekly spot as a panelist on Fox Footy&#x27;s &quot;White Line Fever&quot; and, after being forced to spend extended time off the field because of injury, he became recognised for his informative views on all things football – his roles included being a special comments commentator on Triple M&#x27;s football coverage as well as more regular appearances on &quot;The AFL Footy Show&quot; as a panelist.

In 2009, Lloyd appeared as a regular panelist on a new show, &quot;One Week at a Time&quot;, as well as doing special comments on Network Ten and writing a regular column for &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper. Following his retirement, Lloyd has been heavily involved in the media.

Lloyd signed with the Network Ten AFL team as an expert commentator for the 2010 and 2011 AFL seasons on Channel Ten and One HD (he had already provided special commentary during various matches of the 2009 AFL season for the network), until Ten Sport lost the rights at the end of the 2011 AFL season. He also worked for radio station SEN, was a co-host of &quot;The Game Plan&quot; on One HD during 2011, and continued working for &quot;The Age&quot;.

Lloyd&#x27;s autobiography (co-authored with Andrew Clarke), &quot;Straight Shooter&quot;, was released in July 2011.

After Network Ten lost the AFL broadcasting rights, Lloyd joined the Nine Network for 2012 to be a panelist on &quot;The Footy Show&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Footy Show&quot;. He also left SEN to join 3AW&#x27;s AFL special comments team.

In 2013, he joined &quot;Footy Classified&quot; as a panelist alongside Gary Lyon, Craig Hutchison and Caroline Wilson; as well as continuing his regular roles on &quot;The Sunday Footy Show&quot; and 3AW Football. Lloyd is also a recurring panelist on &quot;The Footy Show&quot; and on occasion appears on &quot;Nine News Melbourne&quot; to provide insights into the weekly round of matches.

In March 2022, Lloyd announced on &quot;Footy Classified&quot; that he had Bell&#x27;s palsy, a form of facial paralysis.

==Coaching career==
On 14 November 2014, it was announced that Lloyd would return to the Essendon Football Club as a part-time forwards coach, working closely with the club&#x27;s forwards.

He currently coaches the school football side at Haileybury College in Melbourne. 

==Personal life==
Lloyd&#x27;s parents are John and Bev Lloyd. John Lloyd played 29 games for Carlton from 1965–1967 and coached the Braybrook Football Club to three premierships. The family moved to Scotland for three years because of John Lloyd&#x27;s work and it was there that Lloyd played rugby and soccer for his Currie club.

Lloyd has two older brothers, Simon, who is an assistant coach at the Geelong Football Club, and Brad, who is a former Hawthorn player (and former captain of the Williamstown Football Club) and now head of football at the Carlton Football Club, as well as one older sister, Kylie, who is the Finance Manager at Nine Network Australia.

On 9 November 2002, Lloyd married his childhood sweetheart, Lisa-Marie Caparello, usually known as &quot;Lisa&quot;, at Xavier College Chapel. Their wedding was covered by &quot;New Idea&quot; magazine, and a documentary of the day, titled &quot;One Day in November&quot;, was also aired on Fox Footy Channel. 
Lisa Lloyd appeared on &quot;The Footy Show&quot;&#x27;s singing competition, &quot;Screamers&quot;, in 2005 and was also a regular presenter on Fox Footy&#x27;s &quot;Living With Footballers&quot;.

The Lloyds have three children: Jaeda Ruby (born December 2006), Kira Grace (born September 2009) and Jacob Matthew (born November 2012).

<text>Brij Narayan Chakbast (19 January 1882 12 February 1926), also spelled as Brij Narain Chakbast, was an Indian Urdu poet.

== Life ==
Chakbast (1882–1926) was an Urdu poet. He was born on 19 January 1882 in a Kashmiri Pandit family settled in North India in the 15th century A.D.. Chakbast was born in Faizabad (near Lucknow) in 1882. His father Pandit Udit Narayan Chakbast, was born at Lucknow in, circa 1843, and he was also a poet. Pandit Udit Narayan was deputy collector, the highest post that any Indian could have at that time. After the death of his father in 1887, the family moved to Lucknow and they started living in Kashmiri Mohalla of Lucknow. Chakbast was educated in Lucknow, and he became a successful lawyer. Chakbast married in 1905, but lost his wife and first child in 1906. He married again in 1907, and settled down as a practising lawyer at Lucknow. On 12 February 1926, he collapsed at the railway station in Rae Bareli and died a few hours later at the age of 44.

Chakbast made a thorough study of Urdu poetry. He defended Daya Shankar Kaul Nasim when it was suggested that he was not the author of the epic &quot;Gul Bakawali&quot;.
He was actively involved in social and political affairs, and was a strong proponent of the Home Rule and actively participated in the Home Rule Movement.

== Education ==

Chakbast&#x27;s early education took place in Faizabad. Following his father&#x27;s death, his family relocated to Lucknow, where he completed the rest of his education. He earned his B.A. degree in 1905 and his L.L.B. in 1907 from Canning College, Lucknow,which was affiliated with Allahabad University at the time. This institution later became part of Lucknow University. After completing his studies, Chakbast went on to establish a successful career as a lawyer.

== Works ==

Chakbast was primarily a poet but his prose is also considered at par with his poetry.
Chakbast&#x27;s premature death was a great loss for Urdu but whatever he left is exemplary and is considered among the gems of Urdu literature. He was strongly influenced by Ghalib, Mir Anis and Aatish. Chakbast was primarily a nazm poet. He began his poetic career with a nazm in 1894. He wrote nazms, mathnawi, a play, and about 50 ghazals. His Ramayan ka ek Scene is strongly reminiscent of Marsiya of Mir Anis. His verses from his ghazal 
:&quot;Zindagi kya hai anasir mein zahur-e tarteeb,&quot;
:&quot;Maut kya hai ini ajza ka pareshan hona&quot;

:&quot;Zarra Zarra hai mere Kashmir ka mehmaan nawaaz,&quot;
:&quot;raah mein pathar ke tukdoon ne diya pani mujhe&quot;

&quot;Subh-e Watan&quot; is collected works of Chakbast as its title and many of its poems reflect about his intense patriotism, predominantly a central theme of his poetry.

&quot;Khak-e-Hind&quot;

&quot;Gulzar-e-Naseem&quot; a mathnawi,

&quot;Ramayan ka ek scene&quot; musaddas

&quot;Nala-e-Dard&quot;

&quot;Nala-e-Yaas&quot;, and a play named

&quot;Kamla&quot;

&quot;Kulliyate-Chakbast&quot; and &quot;Maqalaat-e-Chakbast&quot; is the complete collection of Chakbast&#x27;s works in poetry and prose that was published posthumously on the birth centenary of the poet, compiled by Kalidas Gupta &#x27;Raza&#x27; around 1983.

==Legacy==
The 2015 film Masaan starts with and contains various examples of Urdu poetry by Chakbast along with the works of Basheer Badr, Akbar Allahabadi, Mirza Ghalib and Dushyant Kumar. Explaining this as a conscious tribute, the film&#x27;s lyrics writer Varun Grover explained that he wanted to show 
Shaalu (portrayed by Shweta Tripathi) as a person whose hobby is to read Hindi poetry and shaayari, as this is a common hobby of millennial and generation x youngsters in Northern India, especially when in love, but this aspect is rarely shown in Hindi films.

<text>Manda and the Marbles were a pop punk/ new wave band from Columbus, Ohio.

== History ==
:&quot;Many grown-up children of the &#x27;80s have a special place in their hearts for ladies such as the Go-Go&#x27;s, Bananarama, and Kim &quot;Kids in America&quot; Wilde. Their music was pouty, awash in lip gloss and hairspray, and absolutely irresistible. Their songs made pining and heartache sound like so much friggin&#x27; fun. Finally, the valley girl woes have a new poster girl: Manda Marble. Manda and the Marbles are a Columbus, Ohio trio whose songs mirror those of sassy female-fronted pop bands – sunny surf rhythms and rather forlorn subject matter.&quot;

::Jeanne Fury, Review of Manda and The Marbles, &quot;NY Rock Confidential&quot;, March, 2003

:&quot;Who is Manda you might ask? Well just take the best of the Go-Go&#x27;s, Berlin, and your favorite girl-fronted 80&#x27;s new wave pop band...that&#x27;s Manda. This will be the soundtrack to many a summer. Prepare to have your hearts broken.&quot;

::Punk Updates, October 15, 2002, in relation to release of &quot;More Seduction&quot;

Founded in 1997, the group produced four albums: &quot;Rock&#x27;s Not Dead&quot;, &quot;Seduction&quot;, &quot;More Seduction&quot;, and &quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot;. The band was originally a three-piece featuring Manda Marble on vocals and bass, Joe A. Damage on guitar, and Mark Slak on drums. Work on their most recent album featured keyboardist Elias Dubok, 2001 was the band&#x27;s breakout year; they played at the CMJ Music Marathon and later signed with Go-Kart Records.

The Marbles were the first band to release a song using podcasting and were heralded for this achievement on MTV and the BBC. While the band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot; (to which the podcast distribution related), released on September 17, 2002, was well-received, the label to which it had been licensed, Addison Records, ceased operations within a short time after the album&#x27;s 2005 release.

Following guitarist Joe A. Damage&#x27;s departure in late 2005, the band&#x27;s activity slowed considerably. In 2008, Manda Marble and Mark Slak recorded a new demo and posted it on their MySpace page, but nothing has been heard since. The band website (www.marthaandthemarbles.com) is also inactive.

Manda and the Marbles&#x27; music was featured in several motion pictures, including the low budget thriller &quot;Creepies&quot; (2003) and the 1980s throwback &quot;Nail Polish&quot; (2006). Their music also appeared on the MTV show &quot;Rich Girls&quot; (2003-2004), and the band&#x27;s image and name were shown in the film &quot;Come Away Home&quot; (2005).

Over the years, Manda has continued to write music. She released a new album in 2023 which featured all of the singles she wrote from 2015 through 2020. This album is called &quot;The Singles: 2015-2020&quot; and is available for download on all music platforms. The songs have shifted towards an acoustic and more folk-influenced style but still retain a pop edge. Manda has also dabbled in the electronic dance music genre and continues to explore her creative boundaries musically.

<text>James Eights (1798–1882) was an American physician, scientist, and artist. He was born in Albany, New York, the son of physician Jonathan Eights and Alida Wynkoop. James also became a physician and was appointed an examiner at a local engineering school which is now known as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Eights became an assistant to Amos Eaton and helped complete the surveys along the Erie Canal.

Upon the recommendation of Amos Eaton, who called Eights &quot;one of the most competent geologists in North America&quot;, Eights obtained the position of naturalist on the first voyage of discovery made outside the United States. He was a member of the &quot;South Sea Fur Company and Exploring Expedition&quot; of 1829. This was a private enterprise organized by Jeremiah N. Reynolds. The expedition included two brigs, &quot;Annawan&quot; and &quot;Seraph&quot;, commanded by Benjamin Pendleton and Nathaniel B. Palmer respectively, plus the schooner &quot;Penguin&quot; commanded by Alexander Palmer. Eights made observations of the flora and fauna in the lands reached by the expedition, which included Patagonia and Staten Island. He was the first to describe a trilobite fossil found on the South Shetland Islands in the Antarctic, a pycnogonid, and the presence of glacial erratics.

Upon his return, James Eights published some of his materials in journals, but failed to obtain any further positions on exploratory voyages. He held himself out to be a geologist, mineralogist, and surveyor, obtaining some work away from Albany. Later he produced the watercolors and sketches of the Albany of his youth, by which he is now better known. He is believed to have never practiced medicine after the Antarctic expedition. Eights never married and lived his last years in the home of a sister.

Eights died in Ballston, New York. The Eights Coast of Antarctica and the short lived Eights Station exploration base were named in his honor.

<doc id="1116920" wikidata="Q592443" url="?curid=1116920" title="Signetics">
<text>Signetics Corporation was an American electronics manufacturer specifically established to make integrated circuits. Founded in 1961, they went on to develop a number of early microprocessors and support chips, as well as the widely used 555 timer chip. The company was bought by Philips in 1975 and incorporated in Philips Semiconductors (now NXP).

==History==

Signetics was started in 1961, by a group of engineers (David Allison, David James, Lionel Kattner, and Mark Weissenstern) who had left Fairchild Semiconductor. At the time, Fairchild was concentrating on its discrete component business (mostly transistors), and its management felt that by making integrated circuits (ICs) it would lose its customers. Signetics founders believed that ICs were the future of electronics (much like another contemporary Fairchild spinoff, Amelco) and wished to commercialize them. The name of the new company was coined from Signal Network Electronics.

The venture was financed by a group organized through Lehman Brothers, who invested $1M. The initial idea was to design and manufacture ICs for specific customers. In order to facilitate this goal, Signetics did not have a separate R&amp;D lab; instead, the engineering was all done in technical development department, and was closely tied to marketing.

Signetics first developed a series of standard DTL ICs, which it announced in 1962. However, it was struggling to sell custom-made circuits, which was the original goal, and was quickly exhausting the initial investment money, so new investors had to be found. In November 1962, Corning Glass invested another $1.7M in Signetics, in exchange for 51% ownership. This money enabled Signetics to survive, and much of the funding was put into a marketing and sales campaign.

In 1963, the Department of Defense made a decision to begin a shift towards microelectronics and ICs, due to their small size, higher reliability, and lower power consumption. As a result, military contractors began to explore the field, and as Signetics was one of the few firms selling custom circuits, it benefited greatly. In the fall of 1963 and throughout most of 1964, sales grew quickly, and the company finally became profitable. Signetics also grew rapidly, hiring more engineers and increasing its manufacturing space. In 1964, Signetics opened a large new fabricating plant (&quot;fab&quot;) in Sunnyvale, California. At this time, it was by far the largest manufacturer of ICs in Silicon Valley. It later expanded also to factories in Orem, Utah and Albuquerque, New Mexico, where there were two fabs, FAB22 (4-inch) and FAB23 (6-inch).

In 1964, Fairchild began to muscle its way into the IC business. Since Signetics circuits were the de facto standard in the market, Fairchild decided to copy them. However, it used its superior cash position, marketing power, and manufacturing strength to undercut its competitor by slashing prices and flooding the market. Signetics was struggling to compete, and began losing money again. Corning saw this as proof of poor management, and used its controlling interest to drive out most of the founders and take complete control of the company.

Signetics managed to stabilize and become profitable again, but it never regained its market leadership, which was now firmly held by Fairchild. Its engineers continued to innovate in IC technology, and remained a significant force. Around 1971, the Signetics introduced the innovative 555 timer IC, which it called &quot;The IC Time Machine&quot;. This was the first and only low-cost commercial IC timer available at the time, and soon became a best-seller. Signetics was known for creating innovative ICs for both analog electronics and the rapidly-growing digital electronics applications.

In 1975, the company was acquired by Philips, who continued the brand for some years. In the United States, Signetics reached its manufacturing height at around 1980. Later it was fully integrated into Philips Semiconductors (now NXP).

In 1995, Philips spun off the assembly and test operation in South Korea, which was started by Signetics in 1966, as an independent subcontract service provider. They continue to use the name &quot;Signetics&quot;. Since 2000, the Signetics brand is primarily used by the Young Poong Group.

==Notable devices==
Signetics introduced a number of innovative analog and digital integrated circuits which became de facto standard products widely used in mass-produced electronics. Freely-distributed application notes published by Signetics were key in educating students and practicing engineers in the usefulness and simplicity of their ICs. Some designs remain iconic and are still used today in basic electronics lab exercises. 
* The Signetics 555 timer IC was probably their best-known new product. Still widely manufactured and used today in original and updated versions, the basic design appears in many simple electronic timers, oscillators, and other basic electronic systems.
* The Signetics NE565 was a pioneering implementation of powerful phase-locked loop technology in an IC, which along with the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) NE566, helped advance digital communications.
* The Signetics 2650 was an 8-bit microprocessor introduced in the early 1970s and used in several video games and game systems (e.g. the Arcadia 2001). and in the early telesoftware broadcasts.
* The Signetics 8X300 was a bipolar microprocessor developed by Scientific Micro Systems but manufactured by Signetics starting in 1976. It was mostly used as a controller chip due to its limited instruction set and its high speed.
* The Signetics 2513 was a character generator chip used in the TV Typewriter, Apple I, and early versions of the Apple II, as well as Atari&#x27;s earliest arcade games.
* The Signetics 82S100 FPLA (Field Programmable Logic Array) was the first commercially successful user programmable logic device, the forerunner of the modern FPGA.
* NE5532, a widely used audio op amp, now generic and produced by many other manufacturers. According to one 1993 article, NE5532 was &quot;the standard audio op amp to which others are compared&quot;.
* NE5517, an operational transconductance amplifier, still in production by NXP Semiconductors and also generically made by other manufacturers; it is given as a classic OTA example in a number of textbooks.

<doc id="1116922" wikidata="Q1926617" url="?curid=1116922" title="Miami Vice Theme">
<text>&quot;&quot;Miami Vice&quot; Theme&quot; is a musical piece composed and performed by Jan Hammer as the theme to the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. It was first presented as part of the television broadcast of the show in September 1984, was released as a single in 1985, and peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was the last instrumental to top the Hot 100 until 2013, when &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; by Baauer reached number one. &quot;&quot;Miami Vice&quot; Theme&quot; also peaked at number five in the UK and number four in Canada. In 1986, it won Grammy Awards for &quot;Best Instrumental Composition&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Instrumental Performance&quot;. This piece, along with Glenn Frey&#x27;s number two hit &quot;You Belong to the City&quot;, put the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; soundtrack on the top of the US album chart for 11 weeks in 1985, making it the most successful TV soundtrack of all time until 2006, when Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;High School Musical&quot; beat its record.

==Versions==
*The 1:55-minute version that aired with the pilot. The famous synthesized guitar lead hook is absent from it, and it features distinct synth guitar notes in its midsection.
*The 0:57 version in the following 3 regular episodes, which only contains the percussion and keyboards, without the synth guitar hook. It was essentially a shortened version of the pilot, although it already featured the same melody progression and conclusion at its end as in all the later episodes.

According to Jan Hammer&#x27;s manager Elliot Sears, the missing guitar lead hook was the result of the sound elements not being mixed together as Hammer intended.

*The 1:00 synth guitar hook version that aired with all later episodes.
*The 1:00 commercially released &quot;TV&quot;/&quot;Original&quot; version with synth guitar hook, mixed slightly differently than the version that aired with the episodes.
*The 2:26 full radio airplay version, the final 55 seconds of which are very similar to the 1:00 TV version.
*An extended dance remix, released in 1985 as a 12&quot; single containing two different length versions (in addition to the original version of the theme).
*Various edits used over the closing credits, starting with the end of the first regular episode, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.

==Music video==
The music video of the theme is a mini-episode of the TV series with Hammer as a fugitive on the run from James &quot;Sonny&quot; Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs. Throughout the majority of the video, Hammer performs the theme in front of a projector screen playing footage from the TV series – including scenes of the Vice duo chasing him. In the end of the video, he boards a helicopter and escapes from Crockett&#x27;s sight. The video also shows shots of Fairlight CMI screens including the page R (sequencer) page and the waveform page.

==Appearances==
&quot;Miami Vice&quot;″s pilot episode, made as a two-hour TV movie, did not originally have a theme, but the musical sounds and notation that would become the theme were present as background score. When the series got picked up, Hammer created the 60-second version of the theme. The synth-guitar lead was missing in the aired version of the pilot and the first batch of episodes, and this unfinished version of the theme has remained attached to those episodes, even on the DVD video box set released in 2005.

<text>Bass Communion is a solo project of English musician Steven Wilson, best known for his lead role in the rock band Porcupine Tree. Records released under the name Bass Communion are in an ambient or electronic vein—lengthy, drone-heavy compositions. They come about as experiments made from processing the sound of real instruments and field recordings.

Bass Communion&#x27;s albums have often featured collaborations with other musicians, including Robert Fripp of King Crimson, saxophonist Theo Travis, Bryn Jones, and Vidna Obmana.

==History==
Bass Communion has origins in Steven Wilson&#x27;s earliest work as a musician. Taking influence from German experimental electronic music artist such as Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler, Wilson, along with childhood friend Simon Vockings, formed the group Altamont in 1983. They experimented with primitive analog synthesizers, recording their performances, without the use of multitracking. These recordings were compiled on the tape &quot;Prayer for the Soul&quot; in September 1983 and released on the Acid Tapes label, then run by future Imaginary Records boss Alan Duffy.

By the 1990s, Wilson began to notice an increasing amount of music shaped by the same experimental artists who inspired Altamont. Hearing artists such as Paul Schutze and Biosphere, Wilson felt that it was an ideal time to revisit experimental electronic music. The first self-titled Bass Communion album, often referred to as &quot;Bass Communion I&quot;, was released in April 1998.

<doc id="1116928" wikidata="Q6015378" url="?curid=1116928" title="Incredible Expanding Mindfuck">
<text>Incredible Expanding Mindfuck, commonly abbreviated as I.E.M., was a solo project by Steven Wilson (the lead of British rock band Porcupine Tree). Its work was mainly influenced by Krautrock and experimental music from the 1960s and 1970s.

==Background and history==

I.E.M. is seldom discussed in any depth by Wilson in interviews and the album packaging provides very little information. The name &quot;Incredible Expanding Mindfuck&quot; is an in-joke referring to early Porcupine Tree promotional material (in which Porcupine Tree was given an entirely fictional 1970s history and in which the Incredible Expanding Mindfuck was mentioned as a related project).

Wilson&#x27;s work with I.E.M. is in part a continuation of the experimental psychedelic sound which he initially mastered with Porcupine Tree before steering the band towards a more mainstream rock direction with the &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; album. He has also cited &quot;the cosmic jazz of artists like Sun Ra&quot; as an influence on the music.

I.E.M.&#x27;s work is more experimental in nature than that of Porcupine Tree, and is almost entirely instrumental. Almost all instruments on I.E.M. recordings are played by Wilson (although other contributors have included former Bark Psychosis drummer Mark Simnett).

The first I.E.M release was a self-titled album on Porcupine Tree&#x27;s original record label Delerium Records in 1996. It was followed by a limited-edition single called &quot;An Escalator to Christmas&quot;. Further releases have occasionally followed, with little fanfare or direct promotion.

I.E.M.&#x27;s most recent release of entirely new music was in 2001 (although 2005&#x27;s compilation album &quot;I.E.M. 1996-1999&quot; included some previously unreleased material). The project has increasingly taken a back seat to Wilson&#x27;s other projects, most notably to Porcupine Tree, Blackfield and Bass Communion, but also to No-Man, then to Wilson&#x27;s recent solo release &quot;Insurgentes&quot; (which itself contains developments of some of the ideas Wilson has previously explored with I.E.M.) and continue to another six Wilson&#x27;s solo release.

A 4-CD boxset featuring &quot;I.E.M.&quot;, &quot;An Escalator to Christmas&quot;, &quot;Arcadia Son&quot; and &quot;I.E.M. Have Come for Your Children&quot; was released on ToneFloat records in June 2010. Limited to 2,000 copies, the boxset is described as &quot;both an homage and a final farewell to I.E.M&quot;. Each CD is packaged in its own Japanese-style mini LP sleeve within a hardback slipcase box. It also includes a 60-page booklet designed by Carl Glover.

<doc id="1116929" wikidata="Q846958" url="?curid=1116929" title="Thagomizer">
<text>A thagomizer () is the distinctive arrangement of four spikes on the tails of stegosaurian dinosaurs. These spikes are believed to have been a defensive measure against predators.

The arrangement of spikes originally had no distinct name. Cartoonist Gary Larson invented the name &quot;thagomizer&quot; in 1982 as a joke in his comic strip &quot;The Far Side&quot;, and it was gradually adopted as an informal term sometimes used within scientific circles, research, and education.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;thagomizer&quot; was coined by Gary Larson in jest. In a 1982 &quot;The Far Side&quot; comic, a group of cavemen are taught by a caveman lecturer that the spikes on a stegosaur&#x27;s tail were named &quot;after the late Thag Simmons&quot;.

The term was picked up initially by Kenneth Carpenter, then a paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, who used the term when describing a fossil at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Annual Meeting in 1993. &quot;Thagomizer&quot; has since been adopted as an informal anatomical term and is used by the Smithsonian Institution, the Dinosaur National Monument, the book &quot;The Complete Dinosaur&quot; and the BBC documentary series &quot;Planet Dinosaur&quot;. The term has also appeared in some technical papers describing stegosaurs and related dinosaurs.

== Paleobiology ==
There has been debate about whether the thagomizer was used simply for display, as posited by Gilmore in 1914, or used as a defensive weapon. Robert Bakker noted that it is likely that the stegosaur tail was much more flexible than those of other ornithischian dinosaurs because it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the thagomizer being a weapon. He also observed that &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; could have maneuvered its rear easily by keeping its large hindlimbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short forelimbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. In 2010, analysis of a digitized model of &quot;Kentrosaurus aethiopicus&quot; showed that the tail could bring the thagomizer around to the sides of the dinosaur, possibly striking an attacker beside it.

In 2001, a study of thagomizers by McWhinney et al. showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage. This too supports the theory that the principal function of the thagomizer was defense in combat.

There is also evidence for &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; defending itself, in the form of an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; tail spike. The species of stegosaur known as &quot;Stegosaurus stenops&quot; had four dermal spikes, each about long. Discoveries of articulated stegosaur armor show that, at least in some species, these spikes protruded horizontally from the tail, not vertically as is often depicted. Initially, Othniel Charles Marsh described &quot;S. armatus&quot; as having eight spikes in its tail, unlike &quot;S. stenops&quot;. However, recent research re-examined this and concluded this species also had four.

==Mathematics==
In a 2017 paper, the term thagomizer graph (and also the associated &quot;thagomizer matroid&quot;) was introduced for the complete tripartite graph .

== Molecular biology ==
In 2023, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco presented &quot;Thagomizer&quot;, a modality for the interrogation of RNA-protein binding events in CLIP-Seq (Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) data.

<doc id="1116931" wikidata="Q7073760" url="?curid=1116931" title="Oak savanna">
<text>An oak savanna is a type of savanna (or lightly forested grassland), where oaks (&quot;Quercus &quot;spp.) are the dominant trees. It is also generally characterized by an understory that is lush with grass and herb related plants. The terms &quot;oakery&quot; or &quot;woodlands&quot; are also used commonly, though the former is more prevalent when referencing the Mediterranean area. Oak savannas typically exist in areas with low precipitation and feature poor soils. Predominant land uses include rangeland agriculture. Naturally, these savannas depend on natural wildfires (e.g. caused by lightning) to maintain their open vegetation.

== United States ==
Although there are pockets of oak savanna almost anywhere in North America where oaks are present, there are three major oak savanna areas: 1) California, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon in the west; 2) Southwestern United States and northern Mexico; and 3) the prairie/forest border zone of the Midwestern United States. There are also small areas of oak savannas in other parts of the world. (See also Eastern savannas of the United States for information on pine savannas of the U.S. South.)

=== California ===
A mix of grassland and savannas make up about 15% of California. Oak subcategories within the state are separated by region, with the northern type including garry oak (&quot;Quercus garryana&quot;) and blue oak (&quot;Quercus douglasii&quot;), the southern type including Englemann oak (&quot;Quercus englemannii&quot;) and coast live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;), and the foothill woodlands including interior live oak (&quot;Quercus wislizenii&quot;) and blue oak as well. 

=== Midwestern oak savannas ===
The oak savannas of the Midwestern United States form a transition zone between the moist broadleaf and mixed forests to the east and the arid Great Plains to the west. They are found in a wide belt from northern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin, down through Iowa, Illinois, northern and central Missouri, eastern Kansas, and central Oklahoma to north-central Texas, with isolated pockets further east around the Great Lakes, including Ontario. 

According to the findings of Victoria A. Nuzzo, since there is much variation per state, other names used for the Midwestern oak savanna are oak opening, scrub prairie, oak barrens, and brush savanna. 

The bur oak (&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot;) is the dominant species in northern oak savannas, although black oak (&quot;Quercus velutina&quot;), white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;), and Hill&#x27;s oak (&quot;Quercus ellipsoidalis&quot;) are sometimes present. The dominant tree in the south is usually black oak, although the chinquapin oak (&quot;Quercus muhlenbergii&quot;), post oak (&quot;Quercus stellata&quot;), and black-jack oak (&quot;Quercus marilandica&quot;) are also common. 

The flora of the herbaceous layer generally consists of species associated with tallgrass prairies, both grasses and flowering plants, although some woodland species may be present. Some of these plants can include white wild indigo plant (&quot;Baptista lucantha&quot;), purple cornflower (&quot;Echinacea purpurea&quot;) and pasture rose (&quot;Rosa carolina&quot;). There are also a few species that are unique to oak savannas. Some important species in the midwest oak savanna include a variety of bats, like the evening bat (&quot;Nycticeius humeralis&quot;) found in Missouri, and many types of birds, including the blue winged warbler  (&quot;Vermivora cyanoptera&quot;), field sparrow (&quot;Spizella pusilla&quot;), and summer tanager (&quot;Piranga rubra&quot;). Oak savannas, because of their mixture of grassland, woodland, and unique savanna species, typically have a higher plant diversity than grasslands and woodlands combined.

=== History ===
Before European settlement, the oak savanna, a characteristic fire ecology, was extensive and was often a dominant part of the ecosystem. Fires set by lightning ensured that the savanna areas did not turn into forests. Savannas normally were found next to large prairies near rolling hills and this combination of habitat was perfect for deer, bison, elk, and other grazing animals. Only trees with a high tolerance for fire, principally certain oak species, were able to survive. On sandy soils, black oak (&quot;Quercus velutina&quot;) predominated. On rich soils bur oak (&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot;) was the major tree in Midwestern North America. These savanna areas provided habitat for many animals, including American bison, elk, and white-tailed deer. 

Research by Granado-Díaz, Villanueva, &amp; Colombo (2024) on land manager preferences for environmental services in oak savannas offers historical insights into the evolution of conservation strategies. This study illuminates the critical role of managing understory vegetation for ecological health, integrating seamlessly with the natural fire regimes that shaped these ecosystems. These findings underscore the importance of preserving the intricate balance between fire, vegetation, and wildlife that defines the oak savanna&#x27;s unique ecological identity. The understory flourishes from exposure, as the oaks tend to be scattered, making for a less dense canopy. Fires contain the oak population, as too much shade would eliminate the grasses underneath.

The most fire-tolerant of the oak species is the bur oak (&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot;), which is especially common in hill-country savannas in the Midwest.
European settlers cleared much of the savanna for agricultural use. In addition, they suppressed the fire cycle. Thus surviving pockets of savanna typically became less like savannas and more like forests or thickets. Many oak savanna plant and animal species became extinct or rare.

However, a lack of generalized terminology or documentation in historical records has made it difficult to know about the past state of oak savannas. 

=== Conservation and restoration ===

Large areas of the Oak Savanna are affected by woody plant encroachment. With the rising interest in environmental conservation, restoration and preservation of surviving areas of oak savanna began. Low intensity, Spring-time prescribed burns have been used since 1964 at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota in an attempt to restore the area to an oak savanna. Burned areas are now more savanna-like, having greater grass and forb with lower shrub and tree representation, than unburned areas, but still have higher overstory densities than apparently existed in pre-settlement times. Decreasing canopy cover density is a key part in these restoration efforts. 

Two separate studies done by Garrastatxu et al. (2024) and Encinas‐Valero et al. (2024) have identified the crucial role of fungal symbionts and the tree-soil microbial system in the health of oak savannas, underlining the importance of these factors in restoration practices. This insight is pivotal, as it highlights the interconnectedness of all elements within the oak savanna ecosystem, emphasizing that successful restoration efforts must account for the complexity of biological relationships. Similarly, the study by Hsiao et al. (2024) on the impact of vegetation and geology on soil nutrient storage in juniper–oak savannas emphasizes the need to consider soil health in restoration efforts. 

Restoration work in the US began in the 1970s in Illinois, followed by work in Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Minnesota. The Bald Hill Natural Area in Corvallis, Oregon, was established in the 1990s in part to protect oak savanna remnants. At one point in time the oak savanna was the most common type of vegetation found in the midwest, but it is now endangered with many ecologists every year working on replacing the oak savannas that have been destroyed in the past.

For centuries, the issue of oak regeneration failure has been acknowledged. Historical records, such as French ordinances dating back to the 13th century, illustrate early recognition of obstacles to oak regeneration. These ordinances required the planting of oak seedlings to prevent overharvesting, given oak&#x27;s significant timber worth and adaptability.

=== Current distribution ===
Pre-settlement there were approximately 50,000,000 acres of oak savanna in what is now the Midwestern United States, all of it located exclusively in a wide strip stretching from southwestern Michigan to eastern Nebraska, and from southern Manitoba to central Texas. After Europeans arrived, fire suppression and settlement diminished the oak savannas to a fraction of their former expanse; they currently exist in many fragmented pockets throughout their native range. 

Valadi et al. have explored the conflicting edge influences on herbaceous species in oak savannas, shedding light on the complex interactions that impact the distribution and conservation status of these ecosystems today. This research underscores the need for nuanced conservation strategies that address both the macro and microecological pressures impacting oak savanna preservation. 

Many sites are protected and maintained by government bodies or non-profit organizations such as The Nature Conservancy, the Wisconsin and Minnesota Departments of Natural Resources, and the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation. In the midwest, about only 30,000 acres total of oak savanna still exist. The savannas that remain are fairly small at about 100 acres and this rarity has caused them to be categorized as “globally imperilled”. It is estimated that about only less than 0.02% of the original savannas remain due to human interaction and many organizations and conservations are prioritizing restoring and recreating these ecosystems in the midwest.

Examples of remnant oak savanna include:
* Kankakee Sands preserve complex in Illinois and Indiana.
* Iroquois County State Wildlife Area in Illinois.
* Neal Smith Wildlife Refuge near Prairie City, Iowa.
* Indiana Dunes National Park in Indiana.
* Hobart Nature District in Hobart, Indiana.
* Numerous State Natural Areas in Wisconsin.
* Lake County Forest Preserve District in Illinois.
* Cook County Forest Preserve District in Illinois.
* Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve near Darien, Illinois.
* Oak Openings Preserve Metropark in Ohio.
* Pinery Provincial Park on Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada.

Examples of restored oak savanna sites:

* Indiana&#x27;s Conrad Savanna Nature Preserve in north Newton County. 
* Oak savanna restoration project site on Winchell Trail in Minneapolis, Minnesota
* Wisconsin&#x27;s Pleasant Valley Conservancy State Natural Area.
* Minnesota&#x27;s Belwin Conservancy.

== In the Western Palearctic ==
In Europe, wood pastures, semi-open oak woodlands used for grazing, were widespread and common landscape features across the continent during the Middle Ages, but have since declined. Traditionally, they have been considered purely anthropogenic landscapes, the result of human clearing of virgin forest since the beginning of the European Neolithic. However, according to proponents of the controversial wood-pasture hypothesis, they can be viewed as functional analogs to the oak savannas that may have naturally covered large parts of Europe during the early Holocene. After the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying intensification of land use, they became rarer and were displaced by forests, open croplands, pastures, and meadows. Today, they are largely confined to small patches in western and central Europe, while intact forest pastures are still found in eastern Europe, especially Romania. In the Mediterranean region, oak savannas are still widespread, especially on the Iberian Peninsula.

=== In the Mediterranean ===
In the Western Mediterranean, oak savannas, known as &quot;dehesas&quot; in Spanish and &quot;montados&quot; in Portuguese, are at present widespread, concentrated in Southern Portugal, the Extremadura and Andalusia. They are actively managed and used for the production of cork and as pastures for Spanish fighting bulls and the black Iberian pig for the production of &quot;Jamón ibérico&quot;, among other uses. The main tree components are ballota oak (&quot;Quercus rotundifolia&quot;) and cork oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;), but Portuguese oak (&quot;Quercus faginea&quot;) and Pyrenean oak (&quot;Quercus pyrenaica&quot;) may also be common. Other oak species found in the area include Mirbeck&#x27;s oak (&quot;Quercus canariensis&quot;), downy oak (&quot;Quercus pubescens&quot;), pedunculate oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), sessile oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;), &quot;Quercus estremadurensis&quot;, Quercus × cerrioides, kermes oak (&quot;Quercus coccifera&quot;) and Lusitanian oak (&quot;Quercus lusitanica&quot;).

In the Eastern Mediterranean, oak rangelands are still common landscape elements in Greece, Anatolia and the Levant. They are formed by a number of oak species, including pedunculate oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), sessile oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot; subsp. &quot;polycarpa&quot;), downy oak (&quot;Quercus pubescens&quot;), Hungarian oak (&quot;Quercus frainetto&quot;), &quot;Quercus dalechampii,&quot; Strandzha oak (&quot;Quercus hartwissiana&quot;), Austrian oak (&quot;Quercus cerris&quot;), Macedonian oak (&quot;Quercus trojana&quot;), holly oak (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;), Kasnak oak (&quot;Quercus vulcanica&quot;), Aleppo oak (&quot;Quercus infectoria&quot;), Lebanon oak (&quot;Quercus libani),&quot; Tabor oak (&quot;Quercus ithaburensis&quot;), Valonia oak (&quot;Quercus ithaburensis&quot; subsp. &quot;macrolepis&quot;), Brant&#x27;s oak (&quot;Quercus brantii&quot;), &quot;Quercus aucheri&quot;, &quot;Quercus look&quot; and kermes oak (&quot;Quercus coccifera&quot;).

<doc id="1116933" wikidata="Q2872096" url="?curid=1116933" title="Austar">
<text>Austar was an Australian telecommunications company founded in 1995 as Community Entertainment Television (CETV). Its main business activity was subscription television. It was also involved with internet access and mobile phones.

Austar&#x27;s television subscriber base grew to 747,148 (on 30 June 2010), making it the largest subscription television operator in urban and rural Australia. Austar provided subscription television services to 2.4 million homes, a third of all homes in Australia, primarily using digital satellite technology. Austar also operated a digital cable network in Darwin.

Foxtel acquired Austar in 2012. Since the acquisition, Foxtel has progressively merged all operations into the national system. Starting mid- to late 2013, Foxtel transitioned all accounts to Foxtel and removed the MyStar-related online services, which was the last step in the merge. In November 2013, the Foxtel IQ units were made available with satellite connections for those who wished to replace their MyStar units. The current Foxtel moniker took over all Austar branding in 2014, completing the transition. Austar provided services to Sega Channel in Australia in partnership with Namco Bandai Partners, a joint venture between Sega, Ozisoft, and Foxtel.

==Foxtel takeover==
On 11 July 2011, Austar announced that it &quot;had entered into definitive transaction agreements with Liberty Global, Inc. (LGI) and Foxtel Management Pty Limited (Foxtel) under which Foxtel will acquire AUSTAR by a series of transactions including a scheme of arrangement (Scheme).&quot; This takeover involved a minority shareholder approval on 30 March 2012, the approval of the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission on 10 April 2012, and had approval from a Second Court Hearing. The Austar shares were suspended on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) as of 16 April 2012, and were delisted from the ASX on 27 April 2012. The takeover was completed on 24 May 2012.

==Subscription television (Austar Television/Austar Digital)==

Austar&#x27;s main business was subscription television, serving customers outside of the major metro areas. It took programming from both Foxtel and Optus services, and operated on a digital platform.

Austar Television was available in 2.4 million homes in regional areas of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia and all areas of Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Subscriber numbers to Austar Television were second behind Foxtel. Delivery methods include utilising the Optus C-Class Satellite Optus C1 and a digital cable network in Darwin.

===On Demand (Featured) ===

Austar featured On Demand, used to deliver Austar shows on-demand to MyStar each week to those with a MyStar subscription. It has since been replaced by Foxtel On Demand.

===Austar AnyWhere===

Austar AnyWhere was Austar&#x27;s online TV service, which allowed customers to watch or download full-length programs online. Austar Anywhere closed on 30 June 2013.

===The &quot;MyStar&quot; personal digital recorder===
MyStar was launched to existing subscribers in late 2007, with a general launch to both new and existing customers in February 2008.

The last MyStar was the model T500. It was a four-tuner set-top box equipped with two satellite tuners and two terrestrial tuners available both for viewing and recording standard definition digital free-to-air services including full electronic program guide data for Seven Network, WIN Television, Prime Television and Network Ten. (ABC, SBS and ABC2 continue to be provided via satellite). However, only two tuners can be used because the processor is not capable of handling all four tuners at once.

It featured a 160 GB hard drive, with 120 GB user accessible. It could record 60 hours of content. Because it is equipped with Macrovision copy protection, content saved to the MyStar cannot be transferred to other media (such as VHS or DVD) without the use of something such as a video stabiliser. It had support for time shifting for up to one hour.

Support for Dolby Digital Surround Sound was available on selected programming when connected to appropriate equipment, however the Mystar box wouldn&#x27;t control the volume when using optical or coax, the volume had to be controlled by the device it was plugged into. It also had support for Closed Captioning and four different aspect ratios (4:3 Cropped, 16:9 Letterbox, 16:9 Postcard and 16:9 Widescreen). Both of these features were accessible through the remote&#x27;s coloured buttons.

It supported additional outputs not found in some of the standard decoders, such as component video, as well as both coaxial and optical digital audio outputs. Support for Composite Video, S-Video and RF out were also available. It also had USB and Ethernet ports, but they didn&#x27;t have a clear function as yet, and were likely to be used for updating the decoder.

The MyStar Remote is similar to the standard Austar Digital remote, but it had the addition of buttons specific to recording and playing back video. It shared an almost identical design to the Foxtel iQ remote, with the exception that it has an Austar button instead of a Foxtel button, and there was no AV button.

The next generation of MyStar, called MyStar HD, was launched on 15 November 2009, with installations beginning the following day. It had many advantages over its predecessor, most notably support for 1080i, HD programming. It included a 320 GB hard disk, a doubling over the 160 GB found in the original MyStar. Only 160 GB of this was available for recordings and other user-selected content, with the other 160 GB being reserved for OnDemand content, which was launched in early 2010. MyStar HD also included an HDMI output, allowing HD content to be viewed in its native resolution. It had a model number of T600 and also a T601.

Austar planned to use MyStar HD as its cornerstone set-top box, with true video-on-demand launched in 2010, and more access to web content becoming available after that time, building up to a complete interface redesign for its set-top boxes in late 2011 or early 2012. Since the Foxtel acquisition, these plans have changed. The plan was originally to upgrade MyStar and phase it out in 2014, however, in 2013, Foxtel decided to convert their IQHD units to satellite connections and made them available to &quot;Austar&quot; customers in November 2013. Foxtel had no plans to force current MyStar subscribers to replace their unit. If they don&#x27;t wish, however, they are offering upgrades to customers who wish to take advantage before the IQ3 launch in 2015.

===Mystar criticism===
MyStar had ongoing technical issues which have plagued the system since release; however, Austar have said that &quot;they have a huge team of people that will actively jump onto any issues as soon as they are reported to the call centre&quot;. Some of the numerous bugs included the MyStar box regularly causing the screen to black out, recordings to fail, and the screen to freeze. The box has also been reported to automatically switch itself off and on.

==Austar Mobile (mobile telephony)==
Established in 2000, Austar Mobile offered mobile services via resale agreements with Optus [GSM] mobile network. After the closure of Telstra&#x27;s CDMA network, Austar mobile would only offer services through Optus. Austarmobile, on 31 December 2009, had 19,970 customers.

==Dial-up internet (Austarnet)==
In August 2011, Austarnet announced its exit from the Internet business and indicated that services would be discontinued on 30 September 2011.

==Broadband internet (Austar Broadband)==
Established in 2006, Austar Broadband operated as a trial network in Wagga Wagga and Tamworth, New South Wales.

===Austar/Unwired Alliance===
In 2005, Austar United and wireless internet provider Unwired announced a deal to swap spectrum under either company&#x27;s control to allow for interoperable wireless broadband services across the country. In 2006, Austar United and Unwired together with Soul Converged Telecommunications formed AUSAlliance for the purposes of obtaining funding from the Australian Government&#x27;s Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program and rolling out a regional broadband network.

===Austar/Opel agreement===
In 2008, Austar entered into an agreement to sell its 2.5 &amp; 3.5 GHz spectrum licences to the OPEL consortium (Optus &amp; Elders) for A$65 million and enter into a wholesale agreement with Optus for the resale of products operated by the OPEL consortium. The sale was contingent on the OPEL network rollout, so was cancelled upon the cancellation of the OPEL network by the Australian Government.

<doc id="1116938" wikidata="Q111812" url="?curid=1116938" title="Coumarin">
<text>Coumarin () or 2&quot;H&quot;-chromen-2-one is an aromatic organic chemical compound with formula . Its molecule can be described as a benzene molecule with two adjacent hydrogen atoms replaced by an unsaturated lactone ring , forming a second six-membered heterocycle that shares two carbons with the benzene ring. It belongs to the benzopyrone chemical class and considered as a lactone.

Coumarin is a colorless crystalline solid with a sweet odor resembling the scent of vanilla and a bitter taste. It is found in many plants, where it may serve as a chemical defense against predators. While coumarin is not an anticoagulant, its 3-alkyl-4-hydroxy derivatives, such as the fungal metabolite dicoumarol, inhibit synthesis of vitamin K, a key component in blood clotting. A related compound, the prescription drug anticoagulant warfarin, is used to inhibit formation of blood clots, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.

==Etymology==
Coumarin is derived from , the French word for the tonka bean, from the Old Tupi word for its tree, .

== History ==
Coumarin was first isolated from tonka beans in 1820 by A. Vogel of Munich, who initially mistook it for benzoic acid.

Also in 1820, Nicholas Jean Baptiste Gaston Guibourt (1790–1867) of France independently isolated coumarin, but he realized that it was not benzoic acid. In a subsequent essay he presented to the pharmacy section of the Académie Royale de Médecine, Guibourt named the new substance &quot;coumarine&quot;.

In 1835, the French pharmacist A. Guillemette proved that Vogel and Guibourt had isolated the same substance. Coumarin was first synthesized in 1868 by the English chemist William Henry Perkin.

Coumarin has been an integral part of the fougère genre of perfume since it was first used in Houbigant&#x27;s Fougère Royale in 1882.

== Synthesis ==
Coumarin can be prepared by a number of name reactions, with the Perkin reaction between salicylaldehyde and acetic anhydride being a popular example. The Pechmann condensation provides another route to coumarin and its derivatives starting from phenol, as does the Kostanecki acylation, which can also be used to produce chromones.

==Biosynthesis==
From lactonization of &quot;ortho&quot;-hydroxylated &quot;cis&quot;-hydroxycinnamic acid.

==Natural occurrence==
Coumarin is found naturally in many plants. Freshly ground plant parts contain higher amount of desired and undesired phytochemicals than powder. In addition, whole plant parts are harder to counterfeit; for example, one study showed that authentic Ceylon cinnamon bark contained 0.012 to 0.143 mg/g coumarin, but samples purchased at markets contained up to 3.462 mg/g, possibly because those were mixed with other cinnamon varieties.

* Vanilla grass (&quot;Anthoxanthum odoratum&quot;)
* Sweet woodruff (&quot;Galium odoratum&quot;)
* Sweet grass (&quot;Hierochloe odorata&quot;)
* Sweet-clover (genus &quot;Melilotus&quot;)
* Meranti trees (genus &quot;Shorea&quot;)
* Tonka bean (&quot;Dipteryx odorata&quot;)
* Cinnamon; a 2013 study showed different varieties containing different levels of coumarin:
** Ceylon cinnamon or true cinnamon (&quot;Cinnamomum verum&quot;): 0.005 to 0.090 mg/g
** Chinese cinnamon or Chinese cassia (&quot;C. cassia&quot;): 0.085 to 0.310 mg/g
** Indonesian cinnamon or Padang cassia (&quot;C. burmannii&quot;): 2.14 to 9.30 mg/g
** Saigon cinnamon or Vietnamese cassia (&quot;C. loureiroi&quot;): 1.06 to 6.97 mg/g
* Deertongue (&quot;Carphephorus odoratissimus&quot;),
* Tilo (&quot;Justicia pectoralis&quot;),
* Mullein (genus &quot;Verbascum&quot;)
* Many cherry blossom tree varieties (of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;).
* Related compounds are found in some but not all specimens of genus &quot;Glycyrrhiza&quot;, from which the root and flavour licorice derives.

Coumarin is found naturally also in many edible plants such as strawberries, black currants, apricots, and cherries.

Coumarins were found to be uncommon but occasional components of propolis by Santos-Buelga and Gonzalez-Paramas 2017.

=== Biological function ===
Coumarin has appetite-suppressing properties, which may discourage animals from eating plants that contain it. Though the compound has a pleasant sweet odor, it has a bitter taste, and animals tend to avoid it.

=== Metabolism ===
The biosynthesis of coumarin in plants is via hydroxylation, glycolysis, and cyclization of cinnamic acid. In humans, the enzyme encoded by the gene &quot;UGT1A8&quot; has activity with many substrates, including coumarins.

==Derivatives==

Coumarin is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a precursor reagent in the synthesis of a number of synthetic anticoagulant pharmaceuticals similar to dicoumarol. 4-hydroxycoumarins are a type of vitamin K antagonist. They block the regeneration and recycling of vitamin K. These chemicals are sometimes also incorrectly referred to as &quot;coumadins&quot; rather than 4-hydroxycoumarins. Some of the 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant class of chemicals are designed to have high potency and long residence times in the body, and these are used specifically as rodenticides (&quot;rat poison&quot;). Death occurs after a period of several days to two weeks, usually from internal hemorrhaging.

==Uses==
Coumarin is often found in artificial vanilla substitutes, despite having been banned as a food additive in numerous countries since the mid-20th century. It is still used as a legal flavorant in soaps, rubber products, and the tobacco industry, particularly for sweet pipe tobacco and certain alcoholic drinks.

== Toxicity ==
Coumarin is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys of rodents, with a median lethal dose (LD50) of 293 mg/kg in the rat, a low toxicity compared to related compounds. Coumarin is hepatotoxic in rats, but less so in mice. Rodents metabolize it mostly to 3,4-coumarin epoxide, a toxic, unstable compound that on further differential metabolism may cause liver cancer in rats and lung tumors in mice. Humans metabolize it mainly to 7-hydroxycoumarin, a compound of lower toxicity, and no adverse affect has been directly measured in humans. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1 mg coumarin per kg body weight, but also advises that higher intake for a short time is not dangerous. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States does not classify coumarin as a carcinogen for humans.

European health agencies have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia bark, one of the four main species of cinnamon, because of its coumarin content. According to the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BFR), 1 kg of (cassia) cinnamon powder contains about 2.1 to 4.4 g of coumarin. Powdered cassia cinnamon weighs 0.56 g/cm3, so a kilogram of cassia cinnamon powder equals 362.29 teaspoons. One teaspoon of cassia cinnamon powder therefore contains 5.8 to 12.1 mg of coumarin, which may be above the tolerable daily intake value for smaller individuals. However, the BFR only cautions against high daily intake of foods containing coumarin. Its report specifically states that Ceylon cinnamon (&quot;Cinnamomum verum&quot;) contains &quot;hardly any&quot; coumarin.

The European Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 describes the following maximum limits for coumarin: 50 mg/kg in traditional and/or seasonal bakery ware containing a reference to cinnamon in the labeling, 20 mg/kg in breakfast cereals including muesli, 15 mg/kg in fine bakery ware, with the exception of traditional and/or seasonal bakery ware containing a reference to cinnamon in the labeling, and 5 mg/kg in desserts.

An investigation from the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration in 2013 shows that bakery goods characterized as fine bakery ware exceeds the European limit (15 mg/kg) in almost 50% of the cases. The paper also mentions tea as an additional important contributor to the overall coumarin intake, especially for children with a sweet habit.

Coumarin was banned as a food additive in the United States in 1954, largely because of the hepatotoxicity results in rodents. Coumarin is currently listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States among &quot;Substances Generally Prohibited From Direct Addition or Use as Human Food,&quot; according to 21 CFR 189.130, but some natural additives containing coumarin, such as the flavorant sweet woodruff are allowed &quot;in alcoholic beverages only&quot; under 21 CFR 172.510. In Europe, popular examples of such beverages are &quot;Maiwein,&quot; white wine with woodruff, and &quot;Żubrówka,&quot; vodka flavoured with bison grass.

Coumarin is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery, as some people may become sensitized to it, however the evidence that coumarin can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed.

Minor neurological dysfunction was found in children exposed to the anticoagulants acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon during pregnancy. A group of 306 children were tested at ages 7–15 years to determine subtle neurological effects from anticoagulant exposure. Results showed a dose–response relationship between anticoagulant exposure and minor neurological dysfunction. Overall, a 1.9 (90%) increase in minor neurological dysfunction was observed for children exposed to these anticoagulants, which are collectively referred to as &quot;coumarins.&quot; In conclusion, researchers stated, &quot;The results suggest that coumarins have an influence on the development of the brain which can lead to mild neurologic dysfunctions in children of school age.&quot;

Coumarin&#x27;s addition to cigarette tobacco by Brown &amp; Williamson caused executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand to contact CBS&#x27;s news show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 1995, charging that a &quot;form of rat poison&quot; was being used as an additive. He held that from a chemist’s point of view, coumarin is an &quot;immediate precursor&quot; to the rodenticide (and prescription drug) coumadin. Dr. Wigand later stated that coumarin itself is dangerous, pointing out that the FDA had banned its addition to human food in 1954. Under his later testimony, he would repeatedly classify coumarin as a &quot;lung-specific carcinogen.&quot; In Germany, coumarin is banned as an additive in tobacco.

Alcoholic beverages sold in the European Union are limited to a maximum of 10 mg/L coumarin by law. Cinnamon flavor is generally cassia bark steam-distilled to concentrate the cinnamaldehyde, for example, to about 93%. Clear cinnamon-flavored alcoholic beverages generally test negative for coumarin, but if whole cassia bark is used to make mulled wine, then coumarin shows up at significant levels.

<doc id="1116939" wikidata="Q1759676" url="?curid=1116939" title="Tragus piercing">
<text>A tragus piercing is the perforation of the tragus, which projects immediately in front of the ear canal, for the purpose of inserting and wearing a piece of jewelry. The piercing itself is usually made with a small gauge hollow piercing needle, and typical jewelry would be a small diameter captive bead ring or small gauge post style piercing jewelry. A related piercing is known as the antitragus piercing.

==History==
The tragus piercing has no ties to any ancient culture and was first established around the time of the rook and daith piercings in the 1980&#x27;s. The name comes from the medical term of the flap of skin that is pierced.The popularity of tragus piercings began to increase around 2005, according to a BBC report. 

==Jewelry==
Barbells, captive bead rings and flat-backed earring studs are the most common types of jewelry worn in tragus piercings.

==Process==
The hollow, low-gauge needle used for the piercing can be either straight or curved, depending on the piercer&#x27;s preference. Tragus piercings are generally not very painful, due to the small number of nerve endings in the tragus, but the sound made may be uncomfortable due to its proximity to the eardrum. Most tragus piercings will take between 3 and 6 months to heal, however some might take up to 12 months to be fully healed.

<text>Ballot Measure 38 of 2004 would have abolished Oregon&#x27;s State Accident Insurance Fund (commonly known as SAIF Corporation), a nonprofit state-chartered workers&#x27; compensation provider. SAIF&#x27;s assets would have been sold and the revenues from the sale would have been used to fund schools and other state services. Voters defeated the measure in the 2 November 2004 general election, with 670,935 votes in favor, and 1,037,722 votes against. It was placed on the ballot by initiative petition by the political group Oregonians for Accountability.

Supporters of the measure pointed to a series of scandals at the government agency. They portrayed the agency as out-of-control and lacking proper oversight, and especially decried the agency&#x27;s hiring of lobbyists to advocate on the agency&#x27;s behalf. Measure 38 supporters capitalized on the fact that former governor Neil Goldschmidt, who admitted in 2004 to a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl in the 1970s, was one of the lobbyists. Later in the campaign, supporters ran ads portraying SAIF as a threat to gay rights, quoting a memo written by a former CEO in which she suggests the agency challenge the Oregon Court of Appeals decision in &quot;Tanner v. OHSU&quot; (157 Or.App. 502), which required public employers to extend domestic partner benefits to same-sex couples. Supporters also argued that abolishing the state-run insurer would lead to more competition and reduce rates.

Critics of the measure, which included the state&#x27;s largest business lobby and the state chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business and the AFL-CIO, argued that SAIF is critical to keeping workers&#x27; compensation rates low. They also argued that Oregonians for Accountability was actually a front for Liberty Mutual, SAIF&#x27;s major competitor for workers&#x27; compensation policies.

<doc id="1116950" wikidata="Q258168" url="?curid=1116950" title="Scaly-breasted lorikeet">
<text>The scaly-breasted lorikeet (Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus) is an Australian lorikeet found in woodland in eastern Australia. The common name aptly describes this bird, which has yellow breast feathers broadly edged with green that look like scales.

==Taxonomy==
The scaly-breasted lorikeet was first described by German zoologist Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. Other names this bird is known by include the gold and green lorikeet, greenie, green lorikeet, green and yellow lorikeet, green keet, green parrot, green leek, and green leaf. It is often colloquially referred to as a &quot;scaly&quot;. Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek root &quot;khlōros&quot; &#x27;green, yellow&#x27;, and &quot;lepidōtos&quot; &#x27;scaly&#x27;.

==Description==
The scaly-breasted lorikeet is about long. The crown and sides of head are emerald-green slightly tinged with blue, while the feathers of the back of the neck and throat and breast are yellow, broadly edged with green, giving scaly appearance. The tail is green with the base of the outer tail-feathers marked with orange-red. The lower flanks, thighs and undertail-coverts green are strongly marked with yellow, while the underwing-coverts are orange-red. They have orange-red eyes, and their bills (beaks) are dark coral-red. Their legs are generally grey-brown.

Male and female are similar in external appearance. Juveniles appear similar to adults, but their tails are shorter. Eyes are pale brown or black, and bills are brown with some yellow markings or orange with brown markings.

==Distribution and habitat==
This lorikeet is common in most timbered areas of Eastern Australia from Bamaga, the tip of North Queensland, south to Illawarra district on the New South Wales south coast; also on some offshore islands. They are generally confined to coastal plains and adjacent tablelands; occasionally found along watercourses west of the Great Dividing Range. They are abundant and mostly sedentary in north; less numerous and nomadic in the south. They favour open, lightly timbered areas and &quot;melaleuca&quot; thickets.

==Behaviour==
The lorikeet&#x27;s predominantly green plumage blends so well with foliage that the bird is hard to detect. An observer beneath a tree where scaly-breasted lorikeets are feeding may take some time to spot the birds. Their dark coral beak is often the first indications to their whereabouts. They seem to favour open, lightly timbered areas, but may be seen in &quot;melaleuca&quot; thickets when the trees are flowering.

The scaly-breasted lorikeet is usually seen in small flocks, flying overhead, or feeding among the outermost branches of flowering trees. They frequent most timbered areas and are often seen in gardens and parklands – even in large cities.

Scaly-breasted lorikeets fly swiftly and in a straight path. As they pass overhead the sound of their rapid wing-beats can be heard along with their high-pitched call.

===Calls===
Scaly-breasted lorikeets are extremely noisy birds and attract attention by their screeching and chattering. The contact call of these birds is a metallic, rolling, continuous screech in flight. They have a shrill chatter when feeding. While resting, they have a soft, gentle twitter. Although, these birds can be quite noisy as mating season draws nearer. These birds are often making loud tweets/squawks when looking for their food.
===Feeding===
Scaly-breasted lorikeets have similar habits to the related rainbow lorikeet, and the two species often group together in mixed flocks. Both species feed mainly on nectar, such as that from the broad-leaved paperbark &quot;(Melaleuca quinquenervia)&quot;, and pollen, but they also eat blossoms, berries, other fruit, and insects and their larvae. They are very fond of cultivated fruits and often cause damage in orchards; they also raid sorghum and maize crops to feed on unripe milky grain.

=== Breeding ===

Breeding occurs in all months except March and April though usually August–January in the southern part of its range. These birds nest in hollow trees, usually high above the ground, with a layer of wood dust serving as a mattress at the bottom. They usually lay two eggs, rarely three; they are white, oval, and about 26 X 20 mm. Incubation lasts about 25 days. Males spend time in the nest hollow, but apparently do not share in the incubation. Both parents feed the young, which leave the nest six to eight weeks after hatching.

==Aviculture==
The scaly-breasted lorikeet adapts fairly well to captivity, and is playful and quiet, although it can be aggressive. A blue mutation, with dark blue plumage and white breast markings, has been bred in Australia.

<text>Islamic music may refer to religious music, as performed in Islamic public services or private devotions, or more generally to musical traditions of the Muslim world. The heartland of Islam is the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Balkans, and West Africa, 
Iran, Central Asia, and South Asia. Due to Islam being a multi-ethnic religion, the musical expression of its adherents is vastly diverse. Indigenous traditions of various part have influenced the musical styles popular among Muslims today. The word &quot;music&quot; in Arabic, the language of Islam, (&quot;mūsīqā&quot; ) is defined more narrowly than in English or some other languages, and &quot;its concept&quot; was at least originally &quot;reserved for secular art music; separate names and concepts belonged to folk songs and to religious chants&quot;.

At least one scholar (Jacob M. Landau) makes the generalization about Islamic music that it &quot;is characterized by a highly subtle organization of melody and rhythm&quot;, that &quot;the vocal component predominates over the instrumental&quot;, and that the individual musician &quot;is permitted, and indeed encouraged, to improvise&quot;.

Historically, the question of whether music is permitted in Islamic jurisprudence is disputed. Regardless, Islamic art and music flourished during the Islamic Golden Age. Islamic music is also credited with influencing European and Western music; for example, French musicologist Baron Rodolphe d&#x27;Erlanger in his assessment of the Abbasid Caliphate in Islamic history credits Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Farabi&#x27;s &quot;Kitabu l&#x27;musiqi al-kabir&quot; (&quot;The Great Book of Music&quot;) with this influence.

==Secular and folk musical styles==
===Classical Islamic music===
According to scholar Jacob M. Landau, &quot;a fusion of musical styles&quot; was able to develop between &quot;pre-Islamic Arabian music&quot; and the music of Persians, Byzantines, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Turks, Moors, because of &quot;strong affinities between Arabic music and the music of the nations occupied by the expanding Arabic peoples&quot;. The core area where this &quot;new art&quot; of classical Islamic music succeeded stretched &quot;from the Nile valley to Persia&quot;. 
However, many parts of the Muslim world did not adopt the &quot;new art&quot; of classical Islamic music, or adopted it but also kept native music forms which were &quot;alien&quot; to classical Islamic music. In general, the farther from the area between the Nile and Persia one travels, &quot;the less one finds undiluted Islamic music.&quot;

===Middle East===
* Arabic music
* Egyptian music
* Iranian music
* Turkish classical music
* Yemeni music

All of these regions were connected by trade long before the Islamic conquests of the 7th century, and it is likely that musical styles travelled the same routes as trade goods. However, lacking recordings, we can only speculate as to the pre-Islamic music of these areas. Islam must have had a great influence on music, as it united vast areas under the first caliphs, and facilitated trade between distant lands. Certainly, the Sufis, brotherhoods of Muslim mystics, spread their music far and wide.

Khaliji music has roots going back more than 1,000 years, to the Islamic period, under the Umayyads and Abbasids.

===North Africa===
The Berber and Arabic speaking countries of Central and Western North Africa, such as Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Tunisia, share some musical traditions with Egypt and the Arabic-speaking countries of the Middle East. Popular modern styles of music such as Raï and Chaabi originated in Berber countries. In addition, West African influences can be heard in the popular music of Gnawa.

* Music of Algeria
* Music of Morocco

===Horn of Africa===

Most Somali music is based on the pentatonic scale. That is, the songs only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or Eritrea, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (&quot;midho&quot;), songwriters (&quot;lahan&quot;), and singers (&quot;&#x27;odka&quot; or &quot;voice&quot;). Instruments prominently featured in Somali music include the &quot;kaban&quot; (oud).

===West Africa===

Islam is the largest and oldest organized religion in this region, although indigenous Sahelian and Saharan styles and genres are more prominent than those influenced by Middle-Eastern theory.

West African musical genres are more varied, and tend to incorporate both native and Berber influences, rather than those of Arab origin. A long history of court griot music based on historical accounts and praise-singing exists in the region. Wind and string instruments, such as the Kora harp, xalam lute, or Tambin flute (similar to the ney) are generally preferred to percussion, although percussion instruments such as the talking drum and djembe are also widely played among Muslim populations

===Central Asia===
Many of the countries in Central Asia such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have been heavily influenced by Turkic and Persian culture. Bowed instruments are common, as is bardic singing.

* Music of Central Asia

===South Asia===
The music of the Muslim countries of South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Maldives and Pakistan) as well as countries with sizeable Muslim minorities (India, Nepal and Sri Lanka) merged Middle Eastern genres with indigenous classical musical modes, and is generally distinct in style and orchestration, yet due to the strong links encountered between the Middle-East, Central Asia, and South Asia, it is closer to Middle-Eastern styles than those of the periphery of the Islamic world, which tend to be purely indigenous.

*Music of Afghanistan
*Music of Bangladesh
*Music of Maldives 
*Music of Pakistan

===Southeast Asia===

Muslim-majority Indonesia has been significantly less influenced by Middle Eastern traditions than South Asia. As a result, many local musical styles predate the coming of Islam, although exceptions include Malay Zapin and &quot;Joget&quot;, and the Indonesian &quot;Gambus&quot; (derived from Qanbus), all of which show strong Middle Eastern influence.

There are also local music genres in Muslim-majority regions in Southeast Asia that are influenced by Arabian traditions, such as the &quot;tagonian&quot; of the Sundanese people and &quot;glipang&quot; of the people of Probolinggo

The music of South East Asia&#x27;s Muslim-majority regions is more closely related to the musical genres of South East and East Asia. Gong chime ensembles such as Gamelan and Kulintang existed in the region before the arrival of Islam, and musical theory and method owe more to heavy Chinese influence, as well as Hindu–Buddhist principles, than to Arabic musical philosophy. Variations of one of two main scales prevail in the region among different ensembles: &quot;slendro&quot; and &quot;pelog&quot; (both of which originated in Java).

In Java, use of the gamelan for Islamic devotional music was encouraged by the Muslim saint Sunan Kalijogo.

==Types of Muslim devotional recitation and music==

===Nasheed===
Nasheeds are moral, religious recitations recited in various melodies by some Muslims of today without any musical instruments. However, some nasheed groups use percussion instruments, such as the daff. Singing moral songs of this type without instrumentation is considered permissible (halal) by many Muslims.
Sufi worship services are often called dhikr or zikr. See that article for further elaboration.

The dhikr of South Asian Muslims is &quot;quietist&quot;. The Sufi services best known in the West are the chanting and rhythmic dancing of the whirling dervishes or Mevlevi Sufis of Turkey.

However, Sufis may also perform devotional songs in public, for the enjoyment and edification of listeners. The mood is religious, but the gathering is not a worship service.

In Turkey, once the seat of the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate, concerts of sacred song are called &quot;&quot;Mehfil-e-Sama&#x27;&quot; &quot; (or &quot;gathering of &quot;Sama&#x27;&quot;&quot;). Song forms include ilahi and nefe.

In South Asia, especially Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, a widely known style of Sufi music is qawwali. A traditional qawwali programme would include:

* A hamd—a song in praise of Allah
* A na`at—a song in praise of Muhammad
* Manqabats—songs in praise of the illustrious teachers of the Sufi brotherhood to which the musicians belong
* Ghazals—songs of intoxication and yearning, which use the language of romantic love to express the soul&#x27;s longing for union with the divine.

Shi&#x27;a qawwali performances typically follow the naat with a manqabat in praise of Ali,
and sometimes a marsiya, a lamentation over the death of much of Ali&#x27;s family at the Battle of Karbala.

The most well-known qawwali singer in modern times is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.

Another traditional South Asian genre of Sufi music is the Kafi, which is more meditative and involves solo singing as opposed to the ensemble form seen in qawwali. The most widely known exponent of the Kafi is the Pakistani singer Abida Parveen.

Sufi music has developed with the times. A Pakistani Sufi rock band, Junoon, was formed in the 1990s to bring a modern twist to suit the new younger generation. The band achieved wide popularity, in Pakistan as well as in the West.

===Music for public religious celebrations===
* Ta&#x27;zieh music—Ta&#x27;zieh is a passion play, part musical drama, part religious drama, rarely performed outside Iran. It depicts the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, venerated by Shia Muslims.
* Ashurah music—performed during the Muharram mourning period, commemorating the deaths of Imam Hussein and his followers. (Shia)
* Thikiri (from the Arabic word &quot;Dhikr&quot;) which means remembrance of God—performed by the Qadiriyya Sufi orders of waYao or Yao people in East and Southern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and South Africa).
* Menzuma—moral songs performed in Ethiopia.
* Madih nabawi—Arabic hymns praising Muhammad.

==Modes==
* Arabic Maqam
* Dastgah
* Turkish makam

According to scholar Jacob M. Landau, in Islamic music, &quot;melodies are organized in terms of &quot;maqāmāt&quot; (singular &quot;maqām&quot;), or &quot;modes,&quot; characteristic melodic patterns with prescribed scales, preferential notes, typical melodic and rhythmic formulas, variety of intonations, and other conventional devices.&quot;

rhythmic modes are known as &quot;īqāʿāt&quot; (singular &quot;īqāʿ&quot;), and they have a &quot;cyclical patterns of strong and weak beats&quot;.

==Instruments==
Although there are a wide variety of opinions on the permissibility of musical instruments, those who produce Islamic music with instruments often feature the following instruments:

Traditional:
* Drums (daf, bendir, zarb, rebana, etc.)
* Gongs

==Differences of opinion over prohibition==

The question of permissibility of music in Islamic jurisprudence is historically disputed, and with the advent of a whole new generation of Muslim musicians who try to blend their work and faith, the issue &quot;has taken on extra significance&quot;.

Islamic art and music flourished during the Islamic Golden Age.

<text>Lake Ginninderra is a dam located on the Ginninderra Creek in Canberra. It is adjacent to the Belconnen Town Centre. The lake was constructed in 1974 to collect stormwater discharge from a catchment that includes the surrounding suburbs of Aranda, Macquarie, Cook, Bruce, Belconnen, McKellar, Giralang, Kaleen in the eastern areas of Belconnen.

The lake is home to much wildlife, such as the Black swan, moorhens, ducks and the Rakali.

The lake was formed through the construction of the Ginninderra Drive embankment across Ginninderra Creek. The lake has a surface area of and an average depth of . Water flow out of the lake is via a multi-celled concrete culvert structure and spillway chute on the Ginninderra Drive embankment.

During 2004 the Ginninderra Drive embankment was raised by one metre. The earthen embankments on the Coulter Drive side of the lake have been raised as well.

The Belconnen Arts Centre and the Lake Ginninderra Sea Scouts are located on its southern shore.

<text>NRLMSISE-00 is an empirical, global reference atmospheric model of the Earth from ground to space. It models the temperatures and densities of the atmosphere&#x27;s components. A primary use of this model is to aid predictions of satellite orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This model has also been used by astronomers to calculate the mass of air between telescopes and laser beams in order to assess the impact of laser guide stars on the non-lasing telescopes.

==Development==
The model, developed by Mike Picone, Alan Hedin, and Doug Drob, is based on the earlier models MSIS-86 and MSISE-90, but updated with actual satellite drag data. It also predicts anomalous oxygen.

&quot;NRL&quot; stands for the US Naval Research Laboratory. MSIS stands for mass spectrometer and incoherent scatter radar, the two primary data sources for development of earlier versions of the model. &quot;E&quot; indicates that the model extends from the ground through exosphere and &quot;00&quot; is the year of release.

Over the years since introduction, NRLMSISE-00 has become the standard for international space research.

==Input and output==
The inputs for the model are:
* Year and day
* time of day
* geodetic altitude from 0 to 1,000 km
* geodetic latitude
* longitude
* local apparent solar time
* 81-day average of F10.7 solar flux
* daily F10.7 solar flux for previous day
* Daily magnetic index

The outputs of the model are:
* Helium number density
* Oxygen (O) number density
* Oxygen (O2) number density
* Nitrogen (N) number density
* Nitrogen (N2) number density
* Argon (Ar) number density
* Hydrogen (H) number density
* total mass density
* Anomalous oxygen number density
* Exospheric temperature
* temperature at altitude

<text>Martinho da Vila (born February 12, 1938) is a Brazilian singer and composer who is considered to be one of the main representatives of samba and MPB. He is a prolific songwriter, with hundreds of recorded songs across over 40 solo albums. He also has many songs that were recorded by singers from different musical genres.

Internationally celebrated artists such as Nana Mouskouri (Greece), Ornella Vanoni (Italy), Katia Guerreiro (Portugal), Rosario Flores (Spain) have put their voices to Martinho’s songs and lyrics.

As a singer, he is considered by critics as one of the top exponents of samba to have ever lived. Among his many national collaborations, a few notable names are Zeca Pagodinho, Arlindo Cruz, Chico Buarque, Beth Carvalho, Noel Rosa, Alcione, among others. Furthermore, Martinho composed some of the most important samba enredos (samba school themed songs) and has forged a solid partnership with the Vila Isabel samba school.

In spite of being a self-taught singer / songwriter with no academic background, Martinho has a great connection with classical music. He participated in the symphonic project &quot;Samba Classics&quot; under the baton of the late Maestro Silvio Barbato, which went on to be performed by several classical orchestras such as the Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, and Espirito Santo Orchestras, as well as the Orquestra Petrobras and the Orfeônica of Denmark. He also devised, in partnership with Maestro Bruno Leonardo, the Black Concert, a Symphonic performance that focuses on the participation of black musicians in classical music.

In addition to being a celebrated singer and songwriter, Martinho is also a writer and author of 13 books: Notable works include &quot;Os Lusófonos&quot;, republished in Portugal, as well as &quot;Joanna and Joanes - A Fluminense Romance&quot;, and &quot;Ópera Negra&quot;, which was later translated into French. At the Book Fair in Paris in 2015, Martinho released his novel &quot;Os Lusófonos&quot;.

As a journalist, Martinho writes articles for &quot;O Globo&quot;, &quot;Folha de São Paulo&quot; and &quot;O Estadão&quot; newspapers, several magazines, and, for two years, he was a weekly columnist of the newspaper &quot;O Dia&quot;.

He is also politically active and a prominent figure and spokesperson for Afro-Brazilian issues as well as for the Communist Party of Brazil. He is the author of six books, and has been a recording artist since 1969.

Apart from his own interpretations, Simone stands out as one of his greatest interpreters, with a whole album dedicated to him, entitled &quot;Café com leite&quot;.

== Biography ==
Martinho da Vila’s artistic career became public at the III Festival of Record, in 1967, when he entered the competition with the song &quot;Menina Moça&quot;. However, success came the following year, in the fourth edition of the same festival, with the song &quot;Casa de Bamba,&quot; one of Martinho&#x27;s classics. The first album, released in 1969, entitled &quot;Martinho da Vila&quot;, already demonstrated the extent of his talent as a composer and musician, which, in addition to &quot;Casa de Bamba&quot;, showcased masterpieces such as &quot;O Pequeno Burguês,&quot; &quot;Quem é do Mar não enjoa&quot; and &quot;Pra que Dinheiro&quot; among other gems such as&quot; Brasil Mulato&quot;, &quot;Amor pra que Nasceu&quot; and &quot;Tom Maior&quot;. 
He soon became one of the most respected Brazilian artists as well as one of the major album sellers in Brazil. He was only the second samba recording artist to exceed the mark of one million copies sold with the CD &quot;Tá Delícia&quot;, &quot;Tá Gostoso&quot; released in 1995 (the first was Agepê, which in 1984 sold a million and a half copies with his Brazilian Mix album).

At the closing ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics, Martinho performed onstage in the Maracanã Stadium, singing &quot;&quot; with his three daughters and one granddaughter.

== Awards ==
Among the titles received are Carioca Citizen (for citizens of Rio de Janeiro), Citizen Benefactor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Commander of the official degree in Republic and the Order of Cultural Merit, for his contribution to Brazilian culture. In his musical career, in 1991 Martinho won the Shell Award for Brazilian Popular Music. In 2014, he was nominated to the Latin Grammy for Best Samba / Pagode Album. In 2021, da Vila was one of the recipients of the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and his album &quot;Rio: Só Vendo a Vista&quot; was nominated in the same ceremony in the Best Samba/Pagode Album category.

Her album &quot;Negra Ópera&quot; was chosen by the Associação Paulista de Críticos de Arte as one of the 50 best Brazilian albums of 2023.

== Samba School ==
His dedication to the beloved GRES Unidos de Vila Isabel, began in 1965. Before that, he used to be a regular at the Aprendizes da Boca do Mato samba school. Since joining Vila Isabel, he has written dozens of songs for the school. He wrote the samba “Kizomba: A Festa da Raça”, which secured Special Group title in 1988. 
After a 17-year hiatus, in 2010, Martinho won the sambas enredo contest again, providing the school’s theme - Noel Rosa, another composer of Vila Isabel, to celebrate his centenary. Martinho had said that would be his last samba enredo. In 2013, when Martinho turned 75, his son Tonico da Vila took Vila Isabel to the title with the theme “A Vila Canta o Brasil, Celeiro do Mundo. Água no Feijão, que Chegou Mais Um”. [5]

<text>The Drina Banovina or Drina Banate () was a province (banovina) of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1929 and 1941. Its capital was Sarajevo and it included portions of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. It was named after the Drina River and, like all Yugoslav banovinas, was intentionally not based on ethnic boundaries. As a result of the creation of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939, its territory was reduced considerably.
==Borders==
According to the 1931 Constitution of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 
== Demographics ==
According to the Yugoslav census of 1931, the Drina banovina had a population of 1,534,739 and a population density of 55.1 people per square kilometre.

The census also says that Drina banovina had a high agricultural population, with an agricultural population of 91.3 people per square kilometre. This was the second highest agricultural population density in the country behind only Vrbas Banovina (98.8). Overall, Drina banovina had 1,383,686 hectares of cultivated land. 

==History==
In 1941, the World War II Axis Powers occupied the Drina Banovina and the province was abolished and divided between the Independent State of Croatia and German-occupied Serbia. Following World War II, the region was divided between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia within a federal Socialist Yugoslavia.

<text>R v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635; [2002] HCA 55 is a decision of the High Court of Australia which unanimously upheld the decision by a Queensland appellate court to stay an indictment for perjury as the indictment was found to controvert the respondent&#x27;s earlier acquittal for murder. The court held that charging Raymond John Carroll with perjuring himself in the earlier murder trial by swearing he did not kill the baby Deidre Kennedy was tantamount to claiming he had committed the murder and was thus a contravention of the principles of double jeopardy. The case caused widespread public outcry and prompted calls for double jeopardy law reform.

==Background==

In October 1983, Carroll was interviewed by the police in relation to the murder of Deidre Kennedy, a baby whose body had been found on the roof of a toilet block in Ipswich, Queensland, in April 1973. A post-mortem at the time had determined Deidre died of strangulation. During the post-mortem bite marks and bruises were noted on the baby&#x27;s legs and it was these marks which led police to charge Carroll over the murder, as odontological evidence matched the marks with Carroll&#x27;s teeth. Carroll was charged with murder.

The murder trial started on 18 February 1985. The prosecution&#x27;s case was that the teeth marks on Deidre&#x27;s body were made by Carroll, that he had a propensity for biting small children on the legs and that his alibi was false. Carroll claimed he was at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia at the time of Deidre&#x27;s death. The jury found him guilty of murder, but the conviction was quashed on appeal. The court of appeal found that the prosecution had led no evidence to disprove Carroll&#x27;s claim that he was not in Ipswich at the time of the death, that the evidence relating to Carroll&#x27;s propensity to bite children&#x27;s legs was prejudicial and inadmissible and that a jury must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the odontological evidence presented by the prosecution.

==Perjury trial==
By 1999 the police had received substantial new evidence in relation to the case. A witness had come forward who placed Carroll in Ipswich at the time of the killing, another witness claimed Carroll had admitted to him in jail that he had killed Deidre and further evidence relating to the teeth marks was obtained. Carroll was charged with perjury on 12 February 1999. The indictment presented against Carroll claimed he had perjured himself at the 1985 murder trial by swearing he did not kill Deidre Kennedy. In November 2000 a jury convicted him of perjury. Carroll appealed against this conviction.

===Supreme Court of Queensland - Court of Appeal===
The Queensland appeal court upheld Carroll&#x27;s appeal. They found the perjury trial was in essence a re-trial of the original murder trial and that the prosecution case amounted to an abuse of process that contravened principles of double jeopardy. While the court applied an earlier decision by the Queensland Supreme Court, &quot;R v El-Zarw&quot;, which held that a prosecution such as this would not be an abuse of process if there was substantial new evidence, they found that the evidence presented by the prosecution in the perjury trial was not substantial. The prosecution appealed against this decision.

===High Court of Australia===
The High Court dismissed the appeal, finding that a conviction for perjury would inevitably controvert Carroll&#x27;s previous acquittal for murder and was thus inconsistent with double jeopardy principles. The High Court also ruled that this principle applied whether or not substantial new evidence had come to light, overruling Queensland authority to that effect. The courts ruling in this case was due to technicality which was established to prevent double jeopardy

==Public response==
There was widespread public outcry following this decision. The general perception was that a person who had been found guilty by two juries of murdering a baby had &quot;got off&quot; on a &quot;legal technicality&quot;. 

Then-Queensland premier Peter Beattie stated that &quot;there was an injustice done in this case&quot;. New South Wales premier Bob Carr began a law reform process and the Victorian attorney general, Rob Hulls canvassed the possibility of legislative change.

The Kennedy family told their side of the story in a 2003 ABC &quot;Australian Story&quot; episode, &quot;Double Bind&quot;.

Carroll gave his side of the story in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview in 2006. 

The double jeopardy law has since been changed through the &quot;Criminal Code (Double Jeopardy) Amendment Act 2007&quot; (Qld).

<text>Rosalino &quot;Chalino&quot; Sánchez Félix (30 August 1960 – 16 May 1992) was a Mexican singer-songwriter. Posthumously called &quot;King of The Corrido&quot; (from Spanish: &quot;El Rey del Corrido&quot;), Sánchez is considered one of the most influential Mexican narcocorrido singers of the late 20th century. He also composed and sang romantic and radio-friendly songs.

Sánchez grew up in a poor and violent rural area of Sinaloa, the youngest of eight children. His father died when Sánchez was six years old. At age 15, Sánchez shot and killed a man who raped his sister. In 1984, his brother Armando was murdered in a hotel in Tijuana, inspiring him to compose his first corrido. While serving time in prison for petty crimes, Sánchez composed songs for inmates that had stories they wanted to preserve in sentimental ballads.

On January 25, 1992, Sánchez was shot while performing in Coachella, California, United States, but survived. He fired back in self-defense and accidentally killed a bystander. Just a few months later, on May 16, Sánchez was shot and killed by unidentified assailants after a performance in Culiacán, in which he was handed a note, possibly a death threat. Though his murder remains unsolved, it is suspected to be linked to a Mexican cartel or revenge.

==Early life and career==
Rosalino Sánchez Félix was born on &quot;Las Flechas&quot;, a small ranch in El Guayabo, a small farming municipality in Sinaloa. His birth name was Rosalino, but he preferred his nickname &quot;Chalino&quot; since he believed that Rosalino sounded too feminine. He was the youngest of eight children. His parents were Santos Sánchez, who died when Chalino was six years old, and Senorina Félix. Sánchez grew up in an impoverished environment, with limited opportunities, and was surrounded by violence.

On September 1975 at age 15, Sánchez shot and killed a man who had raped his sister. He then moved to Tijuana, where he worked as a &quot;coyote&quot;, smuggling undocumented immigrants into the United States. In October 1975, Sánchez himself fled to the U.S. to avoid Mexican authorities. He worked on farms from Seattle, Washington to Portland, Oregon and in January 1983 he later moved in with his aunt in Inglewood, California. He washed dishes, sold cars and dealt small quantities of marijuana and cocaine. He also had a stint as a driver for Rigo Campos, the owner of a restaurant in Bell Gardens, California who was involved in the drug business, and who was eventually killed by the Crips in South Los Angeles, California. In addition, Sánchez helped his older brother, Armando, run an immigrant-smuggling operation.

In May 1983, Sánchez met Marisela Vallejos, from Mexicali, Baja California, through a cousin. They married in 1984 while she was pregnant with their son, Adán Sánchez, and later had a second child, Cynthia Sánchez Vallejos. They were married for nine years until Sánchez&#x27; death.

In July 1984, Armando was shot and killed in a hotel in Tijuana, which inspired Sánchez to compose his first corrido, &quot;Recordando A Armando Sánchez.&quot; Around this time, he was arrested and served a few months in La Mesa prison for petty crimes. Sánchez composed songs for his fellow inmates, many of whom were drug traffickers and were illiterate, turning their stories into songs. He was paid in cash, watches and guns.

Sánchez was introduced to Ángel Parra, who arranged for the singer to record his first demos at his studio with a &quot;norteño&quot; group, Los 4 De La Frontera. He first began recording in the studio in 1987 and would record fifteen songs, each commissioned by a local &quot;valiente&quot;, and make one copy for each client. By the third recording, his clients were ordering extra copies for their friends, and Parra suggested producing 300 cassettes, which sold easily and was followed by reorders. Sánchez sold the cassettes out of his car trunk or at flea markets, and performed at &quot;quinceañeras&quot; and baptisms.

By 1989, Sánchez had given up his day jobs, had formed his own record label and was hustling his cassettes full-time. The previous year he&#x27;d met Nacho Hernández, whose band Los Amables del Norte became his regular accompanists. Sánchez became well-known throughout Southern California and performed in several venues such as the El Parral Nightclub in South Gate and El Farallon Nightclub in Lynwood.

Sánchez connected with Pedro Rivera, who had set up Cintas Acuario, a small recording studio in Long Beach, California to which Sánchez signed a recording contract. Rivera, the father of Lupillo Rivera, Juan Rivera and Jenni Rivera, was one of the first to release Sánchez&#x27; albums.

===Coachella shooting (January 1992)===
On 25 January 1992, Sánchez performed at the Plaza Los Arcos restaurant and nightclub in Coachella, California, with 400 people in attendance. Eduardo Gallegos, aged 32, an unemployed mechanic from Thermal who was under the influence of heroin and alcohol, requested the song &quot;El Gallo de Sinaloa&quot; to be played. Immediately afterwards, Gallegos jumped on stage and fired four shots at Sánchez. In retaliation, Sánchez fired his gun at Gallegos; the firearm jammed and Sánchez threw it at Gallegos.

Gallegos&#x27; four shots hit Sánchez twice in the chest near his armpit, striking his lung; one bullet hit the accordionist in the thigh. Sánchez&#x27; shots missed Gallegos, but accidentally hit and killed 20-year-old Claudio Rene Carranza. In total, nine to fifteen shots were fired and approximately ten people were hit. Gallegos was wrestled to the floor by a bystander and was shot in the mouth with his own pistol. Gallegos and Sánchez were both transported to Desert Regional Hospital in Palm Springs, in critical condition.

Gallegos, who survived his wounds, was convicted of attempted murder and was sentenced to twenty years to life in prison; he was paroled in 2023.

The shooting gave Sánchez additional press and his sales and radio airplay increased particularly for his non-narco song &quot;Nieves de Enero.&quot; At his next performance in Los Angeles, the club reached capacity six hours before Sánchez was due to perform.

==Murder==
After the January 1992 shooting and the increase in notoriety that followed, Sánchez began fearing for his life. He distributed his gun collection to his friends and sold the rights to his songs to Musart Records, receiving just enough money for his wife to buy a house but depriving his family of any future royalties.

On 16 May 1992, during a performance at the Salón Bugambilias in Culiacán, Sánchez was handed a note from someone in the crowd. The note is commonly believed to have been a death threat, but this has never been confirmed. A video shows Sánchez reading the note, showing signs of worry, then crumpling up the note and continuing to sing.

After midnight, Sánchez left the club with two of his brothers, a cousin and several young women. Their vehicle was pulled over by a group of armed men in black Chevrolet Suburbans. They showed state police identification and told Sánchez that their commander wanted to see him. Sánchez agreed and got into one of their cars.

The following morning, two farmers found Sánchez&#x27;s body by an irrigation canal near Mexican Federal Highway 15, near the neighborhood of Los Laureles, Culiacán. He was blindfolded, and his wrists bore rope marks. He had been shot twice in the back of the head. Sánchez was buried in the Panteón de Los Vasitos in Sinaloa, Mexico.

==Legacy, artistry, and influence==
Sánchez was not a trained singer; he referred to his style as &quot;barking&quot; and knew he was often out of tune. However, he was praised for the sincerity and specificity in his lyrics. Sánchez&#x27; songs were often true crime stories. He was referred to as &quot;part Billy the Kid, part Bill Monroe.&quot; His fans saw him not just as an entertainer, but &quot;the real thing.&quot; Sánchez sang his songs in the Sinaoloan cadence and slang, something no major singer had previously done.

After his death, Sánchez&#x27;s popularity soared; his widow knew of 150 corridos dedicated to her husband. His vocal tracks were used to create new songs and several imitator acts followed. Sánchez&#x27; music continues to be played on many Spanish language radio stations and is popular with young Hispanic listeners. He has also received praise from artists outside his target audience, such as rapper Snoop Dogg.

In 2019, a short film titled &quot;Chalino&quot;, directed by Michael T. Flores, premiered at the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival (LALIFF). An eight-part podcast about Sánchez&#x27; life and the circumstances of his murder, &quot;Ídolo: The Ballad of Chalino Sánchez&quot;, was released in February 2022. In 2023, a TV documentary series titled &quot;Nunca Tuvo Miedo&quot; premiered on Vix. A biopic of Sánchez&#x27; life, starring David Castañeda, is currently in production.

==Family ==
Sánchez&#x27;s son, Adán Sánchez, was also a successful regional Mexican American singer. In 2004, at age 19, while riding in his father&#x27;s 1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria, he died in a roll-over car crash after the tire blew.

<text>Eiður Smári Guðjohnsen (transliterated as Eidur Smari Gudjohnsen; born 15 September 1978) is an Icelandic professional football coach and former player who played as a forward. Eiður saw his greatest success in England and Spain with Chelsea and Barcelona respectively, where he won the UEFA Champions League and La Liga with the latter and the League Cup and Premiership twice with the former. Along with two spells at Bolton Wanderers fourteen years apart, he also played in Iceland, the Netherlands, France, Greece, Belgium, China, Norway and India in a club career lasting 23 years. He is regarded by many to be the greatest Icelandic footballer of all time.

Eiður is the son of Arnór Guðjohnsen, who was also an Icelandic international footballer. He made his full international debut for Iceland as a substitute for his father in 1996, scoring 26 international goals in 88 caps between 1996 and 2016. He was the captain of the Iceland national team until Ólafur Jóhannesson took over the role of manager. He was part of their squad that reached the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2016, their first major tournament.

==Club career==
===Early career===
After spending the 1994 season with Valur in Reykjavík, Eiður played for PSV in the Netherlands from 1995, playing alongside Ronaldo. Following a serious ankle injury, he returned home to play for KR Reykjavík.

===Bolton Wanderers===
Eiður signed with English club Bolton Wanderers in 1998. He made his debut in September 1998 in a match against Birmingham City. By March the following year, Eiður had become a regular member of the Bolton first team, and the following season, he scored 21 times in all competitions as the Trotters reached the Division One play-offs and the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup.

===Chelsea===
On 19 June 2000, Eiður was signed by Premier League club Chelsea for a fee of £4.5 million. He was the second striker signed by the Blues that pre-season, after Dutch international Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.

Eiður made his debut on 13 August in the 2000 FA Charity Shield at Wembley, replacing Gianfranco Zola for the final 17 minutes of a 2–0 win over Manchester United. He spent most of his first season in London being used as a substitute, but was still able to score 13 times. In his second season, he formed a partnership with Hasselbaink which provided 52 goals for Chelsea in all competitions.

Following the appointment of José Mourinho as manager, Eiður eventually played in a more withdrawn role as he helped the club win two successive Premier League titles. On 23 October 2004, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 home win over Blackburn Rovers.

===Barcelona===
On 14 June 2006, Eiður was signed by La Liga club Barcelona in an £8 million transfer on a four-year contract, as a replacement for Henrik Larsson.

He made his debut on 20 August in the second leg of the 2006 Supercopa de España, as a half-time substitute in a 3–0 win at the Camp Nou against Espanyol (4–0 aggregate). Eight days later in his league debut away to Celta Vigo, he replaced Ludovic Giuly with 16 minutes remaining and scored the winning goal in a 3–2 victory.

He was part of the Treble-winning side in 2008–09 as Barcelona won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League.

===Monaco and return to England===
Eiður joined Ligue 1 club Monaco, on 31 August 2009, signing a two-year deal for a £1.8 million fee.

On 28 January 2010, Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp confirmed that Eiður had joined the club on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 season, despite undergoing a medical at West Ham United. The striker was offered identical deals by both clubs; however, Eiður opted to join Spurs. On 31 August 2010, Eiður signed for Stoke City on a one-year deal and made his debut for Stoke on 18 September in a 1–1 draw against West Ham. After only making five substitute appearances for Stoke, Eiður left on the final day of the January transfer window to join Fulham on loan. On 31 January 2011, Eiður signed on loan to Fulham until the end of the 2010–11 season. After an unsuccessful time at Stoke, he was released at the end of the 2010–11 season.

===AEK Athens===
On 19 July 2011, Eiður signed a two-year deal with Greek club AEK Athens, keeping him at the club until 2013, despite further interest from English club West Ham as well as Welsh side Swansea City. He was greeted by over 2,500 AEK fans at Athens International Airport.

Shortly after signing a new two-year contract with AEK, Eiður stated to the press after he was greeted by the AEK fans: &quot;It was unbelievable, I have played and been in many countries but I have never seen anything like this before. It really made me feel welcomed. I was informed that I would have been greeted but this was not what I had in mind. I am a 100% sure I have made the right choice going to AEK. I have come for trophies and nothing else. The least thing I can do is help AEK achieve their expectations after the way I was greeted at the airport.&quot;

On 15 October 2011, in the derby match against Olympiakos, Eiður was injured in the 44th minute following a collision with opposition goalkeeper Franco Costanzo. The diagnosis was a fractured tibia and fibula which kept him out for the remainder of the season.

===Move to Belgium===

Eiður traveled to the United States in September 2012 for a trial with Major League Soccer club Seattle Sounders. He played one match for their reserve team against Chivas USA&#x27;s reserves and scored a goal.

On 2 October 2012, Eiður signed with Belgian Pro League side Cercle Brugge, signing a contract until the end of the season. On 13 January 2013, after an impressive first half of the season with Cercle Brugge, Eiður signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with city rivals Club Brugge for an estimated amount of €300,000.

===Return to Bolton===
After leaving Club Brugge at the end of his contract, Eiður began training with former club Bolton Wanderers in November 2014. On 5 December, he signed for Bolton for the remainder of the 2014–15 season.

He made his second debut for the club as a second-half substitute for Darren Pratley in a goalless draw with Ipswich Town at the Macron Stadium on 13 December, the same opponents against whom Eiður had made the last appearance of his previous Bolton spell against in May 2000.

On 4 April 2015, Bolton manager Neil Lennon said that the week had been one of the best of Eiður&#x27;s career, as he had returned and scored for Iceland after two years without a cap and six years without an international goal, equalised in stoppage time for Bolton against Blackpool and became a father for the fourth time in that week.

===Later career===
Eiður joined Chinese Super League club Shijiazhuang Ever Bright in July 2015 on an undisclosed contract. In February the following year he signed for Norwegian Tippeligaen side Molde on a two-year contract. He was released from his contract with Molde in August 2016, In 2016, he signed for Indian Super League outfit Pune City as a marquee foreigner but, after the sudden injury, he was ruled out of the entire season. In September 2017, he retired from professional football.

==International career==
Eiður made his debut for the Iceland under-17 national team in 1992 at the age of 14. He went on to score seven goals in 26 appearances for the team before progressing to the under-19 side in 1994. He netted twice in nine caps for the under-19s, before making his debut for the U-21 side later in the year. He represented the U-21s for four years, scoring a total of four goals in 11 caps.

On 24 April 1996, 17-year-old Eiður and his 34-year-old father Arnór entered football history when playing in an international friendly for the senior Iceland team against Estonia in Tallinn. Arnór started the match, and Eiður came on in the second half as a substitute for his father. Both father and son have later expressed bitterness at the fact that they were not allowed to play together in that match. The then president of the Football Association of Iceland, Eggert Magnússon, gave the coach Logi Ólafsson an express order to not play them together because he wanted it to occur on home turf, when Iceland played Macedonia two months later in the first qualification round for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. As it happened, however, the two never got another chance because a month after the match in Estonia Eiður broke his leg playing for the Icelandic U-18 team against the Republic of Ireland. He had difficulty coming back because of undiagnosed tendinitis in that leg. When he had recovered and was again available for selection for the national team, his father had retired.

On 2 September 2006, Eiður scored in a 3–0 away victory over Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, pulling him level with Ríkharður Jónsson&#x27;s record of 17 international goals (the latter had held the record since his third goal in 1948, and totalled 17 in 33 matches from 1947 to 1965). On 13 October 2007, his 48th cap, Eiður broke a six-match international drought with two goals in a 2–4 home qualifier defeat to Latvia to become Iceland&#x27;s top scorer of all time. He said that the record was made less important by the day&#x27;s defeat.

Eiður announced his possible retirement from international football after Iceland&#x27;s 2–0 defeat against Croatia on 19 November 2013 in a play-off for a place at the 2014 World Cup.

On 28 March 2015, he made a goal-scoring return to the national team after 18 months away, opening a 3–0 win over Kazakhstan at the Astana Arena in Euro 2016 qualifying.

He was selected for Iceland&#x27;s Euro 2016 squad at the age of 37. He appeared twice, both as a substitute. He came on late in their second group match against Hungary which ended 1–1. Iceland then surprised everyone by progressing into the last 16, where they caused another shock after defeating England 2–1. He came on and was given the captain&#x27;s armband in the 82nd minute in their quarter-final match against tournament hosts France. They lost 5–2 and were eliminated, which was his last international match.

==Personal life==
In September 2001, Eiður, Chelsea teammates John Terry, Frank Lampard and Jody Morris, and Leicester City&#x27;s Frank Sinclair, were drunk and unruly in a Heathrow Airport hotel containing many Americans left stranded by the September 11 attacks. The Chelsea quartet were each fined two weeks&#x27; wages, totalling around £100,000, which was donated to the 9/11 relief efforts.

In January 2003, Eiður admitted to a gambling problem, confessing to having lost £400,000 in casinos over a five-month period.

Eiður&#x27;s half-brother, named Arnór like their father, signed for Swansea City in July 2017, at the age of 16.

Eiður has three sons, all of whom play football at different levels. His eldest, Sveinn Aron (born 1998) is a professional with norwegian Eliteserien side Sarpsborg 08. Middle son Andri Guðjohnsen (born 2002) plays for Belgium side KAA Gent. His youngest, Daníel Tristán (born 2006) plays as striker for Malmö.

==Coaching career==
In January 2019, Eiður was hired as the assistant manager for the Iceland national under-21 football team under newly appointed manager Arnar Viðarsson.

On 16 July 2020, Eiður took over as manager of FH, along with Logi Ólafsson.

After initially signing a contract extension with FH for the 2021 season, Eiður left the team in December 2020, and took over as an assistant manager of the Iceland men&#x27;s national team.

<doc id="1116987" wikidata="Q832269" url="?curid=1116987" title="Technical Ecstasy">
<text>Technical Ecstasy is the seventh studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, produced by guitarist Tony Iommi and released in October 1976 by Vertigo Records. The album received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, peaking at number 13 on the UK Albums Chart and number 51 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Album chart, later being certified Gold by the RIAA in 1997.

An attempt by the band to experiment and explore other musical territory, &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; features more varied and complex songs than earlier records, with prominent keyboard parts and effects. One song, the pop ballad &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, is sung by drummer Bill Ward, becoming the band&#x27;s first song not sung by frontman Ozzy Osbourne. 

==Composition and recording==
After frustrating legal battles that accompanied the recording of 1975&#x27;s &quot;Sabotage&quot;, Sabbath chose Miami&#x27;s Criteria Studios for the making of &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, which continued the band&#x27;s separation from the doom and darkness that had been a trademark of their earlier albums. &quot;Some people may have heard the band in 1970&quot;, noted Iommi, &quot;and be thinking, &#x27;Oh no, not them again!&#x27; But if they heard us now, they probably might like us.&quot;

In the July 2001 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Dan Epstein wrote, &quot;The sessions proved extremely relaxing for everyone except Iommi, who was left to oversee the production while the others sunned themselves on the beach.&quot; Iommi explained to the same magazine in 1992, &quot;We recorded the album in Miami, and nobody would take responsibility for the production. No one wanted to bring in an outside person for help, and no one wanted the whole band to produce it. So they left it all to me!&quot;

In the liner notes to the band&#x27;s 1998 live album &quot;Reunion&quot;, Phil Alexander writes that, while the band struggled to finish the album, &quot;rock had spawned a new set of iconoclasts as the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Damned… Suddenly Sabbath found themselves both unsure of their musical direction and labeled as has-beens.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s not like now: If you&#x27;re a heavy metal band, you put out a heavy metal album&quot;, Butler explained to &quot;Uncut&quot; in 2014. &quot;Back then, you had to at least try to be modern and keep up. Punk was massive then and we felt that our time had come and gone.&quot;

To make matters worse for the band, manager Don Arden began spending more of his time focusing on another of his acts, Electric Light Orchestra, whose 1975 album &quot;Face The Music&quot; was their first to make the US top ten. Iommi&#x27;s determination to move Sabbath in a new direction was misguided according to some, with Mick Wall noting in the 2013 book &quot;Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe&quot; that while future soft rock million-sellers &quot;Hotel California&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot; were just around the corner, &quot;to try and force that sound on Black Sabbath was like trying to put lamb&#x27;s wool on a suit of armour. It just didn&#x27;t work, pleasing nobody.&quot;

In his autobiography &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne admitted he had begun to consider leaving the band during this time: &quot;I&#x27;d even had a T-shirt made with &#x27;Blizzard of Ozz&#x27; written on the front. Meanwhile, in the studio, Tony (Iommi) was always saying, &#x27;We&#x27;ve gotta sound like Foreigner&#x27;, or &#x27;We&#x27;ve gotta sound like Queen.&#x27; But I thought it was strange that the bands we&#x27;d once influenced were now influencing us.&quot; Osbourne also wrote that the cost of recording in Florida &quot;was astronomical&quot; and that he&#x27;d &quot;lost the plot with the booze and the drugs&quot; during the recording of &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, eventually checking himself into the Stafford County Asylum on his return to England.

&quot;That was the beginning of the end, that one&quot;, bassist Geezer Butler confessed to &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2001. &quot;We were managing ourselves because we couldn&#x27;t trust anybody. Everybody was trying to rip us off, including the lawyers we&#x27;d hired to get us out of our legal mess. It was really just getting to us around then, and we didn&#x27;t know what we were doing. And obviously, the music was suffering; you could just feel the whole thing falling apart.&quot;

While the band were recording the album, the Eagles were recording &quot;Hotel California&quot; in an adjacent studio at Criteria Studios in Miami. &quot;Before we could start recording we had to scrape all the cocaine out of the mixing board&quot;, Geezer divulged to &quot;Uncut&quot; in 2014. &quot;I think they&#x27;d left about a pound of cocaine in the board.&quot; The Eagles were forced to stop recording on numerous occasions because Sabbath were too loud and the sound was coming through the wall.

===Musical styles and songs===
&quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; is an attempt by Black Sabbath to mature as a group and explore novel musical directions. Compared to the band&#x27;s earlier albums, the record&#x27;s songs are more eclectic, complex and flowery, with studio effects and synthesisers appearing prominently. As Greg Pato of AllMusic describes: &quot;The band was getting further and further from their original musical path, as they began experimenting with their trademark sludge-metal sound&quot;, citing the funky &quot;All Moving Parts (Stand Still)&quot; and the melodic, Bill Ward-sung &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; as examples. The latter song – the first time Osbourne did not take lead vocals on a Black Sabbath track – has been compared to the work of Paul McCartney and Badfinger and is among the group&#x27;s most controversial songs. The prominence of guest keyboardist Gerald Woodroffe throughout the album was considered a &quot;surprise left turn&quot;, though Steven Rosen of &quot;Sounds&quot; considers his work on the album to be &quot;supplemental in nature&quot;, adding that &quot;the new synthesized wheezings are nice and so long as he remains in a back-up role there should be little problem with his being accepted by the Sabbath fans.&quot;

Butler has described &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; as a response to punk rock. Music journalist Michael Hann disputed this, saying: &quot;Given it was recorded in June 1976, that suggests they were either way ahead of the curve, or that Butler is mistaken.&quot; In a 2021 interview, Ward cited &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; in asserting the band&#x27;s &quot;punk and prog credentials&quot; while admiring punk rock because &quot;I came from a violent band as well.&quot; He said, &quot;We never made music to fit into anything or to reach a certain audience&quot;. With regard to Iommi being the only member determined to work on the album, Peter Watts of &quot;Uncut&quot; comments that &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; is &quot;the sound of Tony Iommi being left to his own devices and getting pulled in several different directions at once&quot;, believing that he wished to eschew heavy metal for hard rock, while also &quot;nodding at punk and soft rock&quot; but still remaining &quot;quintessentially Black Bloody Sabbath&quot;, with the resulting record combining aspects from all their earlier albums – including the drive of their earliest work and experimentation of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; (1973) – as well as a straight pop song with vocals by Ward.

&quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;″s lyrics dealt with a variety of topics. Tony Iommi&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven &amp; Hell with Black Sabbath&quot; reveals that &quot;Dirty Women&quot; was about &quot;all these hookers&quot; Butler had seen around Florida. &quot;All Moving Parts (Stand Still)&quot; is about &quot;a transvestite who becomes President of the United States&quot;, Butler told biographer Mick Wall in 2013, &quot;because America was such a misogynistic society at the time.&quot; As with their previous two albums, the band continued experimenting with keyboards and synthesisers on &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;. The music itself was less dark and more atypical than that of previous albums, especially on the ballads &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;.

The ballad &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; was written and sung by drummer Bill Ward. Initially reluctant to sing the song for fear of offending Osbourne, he was encouraged by the band to do it. In his autobiography, Osbourne praises the performance, enthusing, &quot;He&#x27;s got a great voice, Bill, and I was more than happy for him to do the honours.&quot; It was released as a single because, said Iommi, &quot;We want to break out as far as we can… so we&#x27;ve decided to hit the singles market.&quot; It has since been covered live by Guns N&#x27; Roses, and features on their &quot;Live Era &#x27;87–&#x27;93&quot; album. It also featured in the 2010 film &quot;It&#x27;s Kind of a Funny Story&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover art was designed by Hipgnosis. Osbourne once described it as &quot;two robots screwing on an escalator&quot;. Hipgnosis&#x27; Storm Thorgerson, who had been assisted by graphic designer George Hardie, discussed the cover with Zoom magazine in 1979: &quot;We&#x27;re very fond of that cover. From the title of the piece, &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, I thought of something ecstatic rather than something technical, and I immediately thought of ecstasy in sexual terms: some sort of mechanical copulation, which would be tricky to do. I then thought of ecstasy as falling in love, perhaps during a brief encounter on an escalator – and, since it was &#x27;technical&#x27;, I thought of two robots ... It&#x27;s really quite simple – he&#x27;s just done curves for the female and hard, angular, macho lines for the male. It&#x27;s really quite sexist, actually – stereotyped. Anyway, it&#x27;s love at first sight, but I felt robots wouldn&#x27;t do it like humans would do it, so instead they&#x27;re squirting lubricating fluid at one another.&quot; The UK release had a two-sided insert of lyrics and credits.

==Tour==
During the subsequent 1977 European tour in support of &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, the band was supported by AC/DC. The relationship between bassist Geezer Butler and AC/DC rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young was quite tense. Guitarist Tony Iommi recalls the atmosphere between the two being &quot;heavy&quot; and that the pair did not get along at all. Ward&#x27;s drum tech Graham Wright and Osbourne&#x27;s personal assistant David Tangye stated in their 2004 book &quot;How Black Was Our Sabbath&quot; that the problems between the two originated after a show the two bands performed earlier in Switzerland. An altercation occurred in an hotel bar in which Butler removed a switch-blade comb from his pocket and opened it. Young thought it was a switchblade knife and believed Butler was pointing it at him. In the Bon Scott biography &quot;Highway To Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott&quot;, Clinton Walker writes of the tour: &quot;Sabbath, by 1976, were well past their prime, and AC/DC were all but blowing them right off the stage. Substance abuse in the band was rampant.&quot; Graham and Tangye also disclose that during the tour drummer Ward had begun driving from gig to gig in a rented Winnebago due to a fear of flying.

Osbourne briefly left following the Technical Ecstasy Tour. Although he would eventually return for the follow-up &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;, the band temporarily replaced him with former Savoy Brown vocalist Dave Walker. The band wrote a handful of songs with Walker, and performed an early version of what would become &quot;Junior&#x27;s Eyes&quot; on the BBC programme &quot;Look Hear&quot; with him.

==Critical reception==

The album received mixed reviews, with Phil Alexander writing in 1998: &quot;While today hardcore Sabs fans defend some of the bold steps taken on &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, it was a confused offering which still hit Number 13 in the UK but limped into the US charts at 52.&quot; In 2001, &quot;Guitar World&quot; was less kind, calling it perhaps the &quot;least-loved effort of the original lineup&quot; with the band &quot;trying to stretch its sound in several different directions, none of them exceptionally successful&quot;. It deemed &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Doctor&quot; &quot;a bad Kiss imitation&quot;, while eschewing &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; as &quot;a sub-par Paul McCartney-style pop ballad&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine opined: &quot;&quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; is the sound of Sabbath trying to make a grown-up, radio-friendly rock record and, in some parts, it works ... Mostly, however, it doesn&#x27;t with tracks like &#x27;Back Street Kids&#x27;, &#x27;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Doctor&#x27; and &#x27;Dirty Women&#x27; resorting to clichéd and ill-fitting rock moves.&quot; Greg Prato of &quot;AllMusic&quot; agrees: &quot;it was not on par with Sabbath&#x27;s exceptional first five releases&quot;, but praises &quot;Dirty Women&quot;, the &quot;funky&quot; &quot;All Moving Parts (Stand Still)&quot; and the &quot;raging opener&quot; &quot;Back Street Kids&quot;.

In &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; (2006), Martin C. Strong bemoaned the album&#x27;s &quot;ill-advised experimentation&quot; and believed it marked &quot;the beginning of the end&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; is described as &quot;the Seventies-era Sabbath album least likely to be found in a hard-rock fan&#x27;s collection. It&#x27;s not horrible, but you wonder if anyone in the band remembers making it. Is it an ill-fated attempt to snag some of the boogie-rock money that Ted Nugent was rolling around in? Or had they just run out of steam? Tony Iommi&#x27;s guitar is the only thing left alive.&quot; In his &quot;Uncut&quot; piece, Watts wrote: &quot;Punk is on the horizon and Sabbath try reinvention, with mixed results.&quot; Writing in the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995), Rob Michaels deemed &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; far inferior to the surrounding Sabbath records, adding: &quot;While the album&#x27;s aimless synthesized wankery is arguably technical, ecstasy comes only to those who consign its cover to permanent dope de-seeding detail.&quot;

In 1992, Iommi admitted to &quot;Guitar World&quot;: &quot;Black Sabbath fans generally don&#x27;t like much of &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;. It was really a no-win situation for us. If we had stayed the same, people would have said we were still doing the same old stuff. So we tried to get a little more technical, and it just didn&#x27;t work out very well.&quot;

In rankings of the band&#x27;s albums, &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; was listed 10th by Eduardo Rivadavia of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, 11th by Paul Elliott of &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, and 13th by John Hadusek of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, Nick Ruskell of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, and Michael Hann of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Hadusek believed &quot;Technical Ecstasty&quot; marked &quot;where Black Sabbath changed, and not for the better&quot;, adding: &quot;On one hand, the songs had become more complex, flowery, and aurally varied — nothing wrong there. But it’s awkwardly executed by Iommi, who produced the album. Instead of coming off as progressive, these experiments reek of a band losing touch with the traits that made them great. The studio effects and synthesizers often overtake the bass and guitar.&quot; Ruskell believes the album is &quot;actually pretty good&quot;, despite its reputation as the first Black Sabbath album to reveal &quot;cracks&quot;, but still believed it lacked the &quot;hungry, stoned-out blues&quot; of the band&#x27;s first three albums, or the &quot;coke-guzzling creativity&quot; of the next three. Rivaavia called it a &quot;bold but ill-fated attempt to mature and explore novel musical directions&quot;, believing it could have been comparable to &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; (1973) if not for &quot;the largely unimpressive songs to carry those innovations to fruition&quot; Elliott believes that it was the first album on which the band &quot;faltered&quot;, believing some songs, such as &quot;Back Street Kids&quot;, to be &quot;hokey&quot;, but adding that there are several great songs, including &quot;Dirty Women&quot; and the ballad &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. Hann wrote that while &quot;Back Street Kids&quot; may back Butler&#x27;s claim that the album was a response to punk, &quot;most of the rest of &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; was a mess.&quot;

<doc id="1116997" wikidata="Q112805359" url="?curid=1116997" title="Instrumental and intrinsic value">
<text>In moral philosophy, instrumental and intrinsic value are the distinction between what is a &quot;means to an end&quot; and what is as an &quot;end in itself&quot;. Things are deemed to have instrumental value (or extrinsic value) if they help one achieve a particular end; intrinsic values, by contrast, are understood to be desirable in and of themselves. A tool or appliance, such as a hammer or washing machine, has instrumental value because it helps one pound in a nail or clean clothes, respectively. Happiness and pleasure are typically considered to have intrinsic value insofar as asking &quot;why&quot; someone would want them makes little sense: they are desirable for their own sake irrespective of their possible instrumental value. The classic names &quot;instrumental&quot; and &quot;intrinsic&quot; were coined by sociologist Max Weber, who spent years studying good meanings people assigned to their actions and beliefs.

The &quot;Oxford Handbook of Value Theory&quot; provides three modern definitions of intrinsic and instrumental value:

# They are &quot;the distinction between what is good &#x27;in itself&#x27; and what is good &#x27;as a means&#x27;.&quot;
# &quot;The concept of intrinsic value has been glossed variously as what is valuable for its own sake, in itself, on its own, in its own right, as an end, or as such. By contrast, extrinsic value has been characterized mainly as what is valuable as a means, or for something else&#x27;s sake.&quot;
# &quot;Among nonfinal values, instrumental value—intuitively, the value attaching a means to what is finally valuable—stands out as a bona fide example of what is not valuable for its own sake.&quot;

When people judge efficient means and legitimate ends at the same time, both can be considered as good. However, when ends are judged separately from means, it may result in a conflict: what works may not be right; what is right may not work. Separating the criteria contaminates reasoning about the good. Philosopher John Dewey argued that separating criteria for good ends from those for good means necessarily contaminates recognition of efficient and legitimate patterns of behavior. Economist J. Fagg Foster explained why only instrumental value is capable of correlating good ends with good means. Philosopher Jacques Ellul argued that instrumental value has become completely contaminated by inhuman technological consequences, and must be subordinated to intrinsic supernatural value. Philosopher Anjan Chakravartty argued that instrumental value is only legitimate when it produces good scientific theories compatible with the intrinsic truth of mind-independent reality.

The word &quot;value&quot; is ambiguous in that it is both a verb and a noun, as well as denoting both a criterion of judgment itself and the result of applying a criterion. To reduce ambiguity, throughout this article the noun &quot;value&quot; names a criterion of judgment, as opposed to &quot;valuation&quot; which is an object that is judged valuable. The plural &quot;values&quot; identifies collections of valuations, without identifying the criterion applied.

== Immanuel Kant ==
Immanuel Kant is famously quoted as saying:So act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as means only. Here, Kant considers both instrumental and intrinsic value, although not calling them by those names.

==Max Weber==
The classic names &quot;instrumental&quot; and &quot;intrinsic&quot; were coined by sociologist Max Weber, who spent years studying good meanings people assigned to their actions and beliefs. According to Weber, &quot;[s]ocial action, like all action, may be&quot; judged as:

# Instrumental rational (&quot;zweckrational&quot;): action &quot;determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment of other human beings; these expectations are used as &#x27;conditions&#x27; or &#x27;means&#x27; for the attainment of the actor&#x27;s own rationally pursued and calculated ends.&quot;
# Value-rational (&quot;wertrational&quot;): action &quot;determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake of some ethical, aesthetic, religious, or other form of behavior, independently of its prospects of success.&quot;

Weber&#x27;s original definitions also include a comment showing his doubt that conditionally efficient means can achieve unconditionally legitimate ends:[T]he more the value to which action is oriented is elevated to the status of an absolute [intrinsic] value, the more &quot;irrational&quot; in this [instrumental] sense the corresponding action is. For the more unconditionally the actor devotes himself to this value for its own sake…the less he is influenced by considerations of the [conditional] consequences of his action.

==John Dewey==
John Dewey thought that belief in intrinsic value was a mistake. Although the application of instrumental value is easily contaminated, it is the only means humans have to coordinate group behaviour efficiently and legitimately.

Every social transaction has good or bad consequences depending on prevailing conditions, which may or may not be satisfied. Continuous reasoning adjusts institutions to keep them working on the right track as conditions change. Changing conditions demand changing judgments to maintain efficient and legitimate correlation of behavior.

For Dewey, &quot;restoring integration and cooperation between man&#x27;s beliefs about the world in which he lives and his beliefs about the values [valuations] and purposes that should direct his conduct is the deepest problem of modern life.&quot; Moreover, a &quot;culture which permits science to destroy traditional values [valuations] but which distrusts its power to create new ones is a culture which is destroying itself.&quot;

Dewey agreed with Max Weber that people talk as if they apply instrumental and intrinsic criteria. He also agreed with Weber&#x27;s observation that intrinsic value is problematic in that it ignores the relationship between context and consequences of beliefs and behaviors. Both men questioned how anything valued intrinsically &quot;for its own sake&quot; can have operationally efficient consequences. However, Dewey rejects the common belief—shared by Weber—that supernatural intrinsic value is necessary to show humans what is permanently &quot;right.&quot; He argues that both efficient and legitimate qualities must be discovered in daily life:Man who lives in a world of hazards…has sought to attain [security] in two ways. One of them began with an attempt to propitiate the [intrinsic] powers which environ him and determine his destiny. It expressed itself in supplication, sacrifice, ceremonial rite and magical cult.… The other course is to invent [instrumental] arts and by their means turn the powers of nature to account.…

[F]or over two thousand years, the…most influential and authoritatively orthodox tradition…has been devoted to the problem of a purely cognitive certification (perhaps by revelation, perhaps by intuition, perhaps by reason) of the antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness.… The crisis in contemporary culture, the confusions and conflicts in it, arise from a division of authority. Scientific [instrumental] inquiry seems to tell one thing, and traditional beliefs [intrinsic valuations] about ends and ideals that have authority over conduct tell us something quite different.… As long as the notion persists that knowledge is a disclosure of [intrinsic] reality…prior to and independent of knowing, and that knowing is independent of a purpose to control the quality of experienced objects, the failure of natural science to disclose significant values [valuations] in its objects will come as a shock.Finding no evidence of &quot;antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness,&quot; Dewey argues that both efficient and legitimate goods are discovered in the continuity of human experience:Dewey&#x27;s ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end or supreme principle that can serve as a criterion of ethical evaluation with the goal of identifying a method for improving our value judgments. Dewey argued that ethical inquiry is of a piece with empirical inquiry more generally.… This pragmatic approach requires that we locate the conditions of warrant for our value judgments in human conduct itself, not in any a priori fixed reference point outside of conduct, such as in God&#x27;s commands, Platonic Forms, pure reason, or &quot;nature,&quot; considered as giving humans a fixed telos [intrinsic end].Philosophers label a &quot;fixed reference point outside of conduct&#x27; a &quot;natural kind,&quot; and presume it to have eternal existence knowable in itself without being experienced. Natural kinds are intrinsic valuations presumed to be &quot;mind-independent&quot; and &quot;theory-independent.&quot;

Dewey grants the existence of &quot;reality&quot; apart from human experience, but denied that it is structured as intrinsically real natural kinds. Instead, he sees reality as functional continuity of ways-of-acting, rather than as interaction among pre-structured intrinsic kinds. Humans may intuit static kinds and qualities, but such private experience cannot warrant inferences or valuations about mind-independent reality. Reports or maps of perceptions or intuitions are never equivalent to territories mapped.

People reason daily about what they ought to do and how they ought to do it. Inductively, they discover sequences of efficient means that achieve consequences. Once an end is reached—a problem solved—reasoning turns to new conditions of means-end relations. Valuations that ignore consequence-determining conditions cannot coordinate behavior to solve real problems; they contaminate rationality.Value judgments have the form: if one acted in a particular way (or valued this object), then certain consequences would ensue, which would be valued. The difference between an apparent and a real good [means or end], between an unreflectively and a reflectively valued good, is captured by its value [valuation of goodness] not just as immediately experienced in isolation, but in view of its wider consequences and how they are valued.… So viewed, value judgments are tools for discovering how to live a better life, just as scientific hypotheses are tools for uncovering new information about the world.In brief, Dewey rejects the traditional belief that judging things as &quot;good in themselves&quot;, apart from existing &quot;means-end&quot; relations, can be rational. The sole rational criterion is instrumental value. Each valuation is conditional but, cumulatively, all are developmental—and therefore socially-legitimate solutions of problems. Competent instrumental valuations treat the &quot;function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, &quot;provided&quot; these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problems evoking the operations.&quot;

==J. Fagg Foster==
John Fagg Foster made John Dewey&#x27;s rejection of intrinsic value more operational by showing that its competent use rejects the legitimacy of utilitarian ends—satisfaction of whatever ends individuals adopt. It requires recognizing developmental sequences of means and ends.

Utilitarians hold that individual wants cannot be rationally justified; they are intrinsically worthy subjective valuations and cannot be judged instrumentally. This belief supports philosophers who hold that facts (&quot;what is&quot;) can serve as instrumental means for achieving ends, but cannot authorize ends (&quot;what ought to be&quot;). This fact-value distinction creates what philosophers label the &quot;is-ought problem&quot;: wants are intrinsically fact-free, good in themselves; whereas efficient tools are valuation-free, usable for good or bad ends. In modern North-American culture, this utilitarian belief supports the libertarian assertion that every individual&#x27;s intrinsic right to satisfy wants makes it illegitimate for anyone—but especially governments—to tell people what they ought to do.

Foster finds that the &quot;is-ought problem&quot; is a useful place to attack the irrational separation of good means from good ends. He argues that &quot;want-satisfaction&quot; (&quot;what ought to be&quot;) cannot serve as an intrinsic moral compass because &#x27;wants&#x27; are themselves consequences of transient conditions.
 
Since &#x27;wants&#x27; are shaped by social conditions, they must be judged instrumentally; they arise in problematic situations when habitual patterns of behavior fail to maintain instrumental correlations.

=== Examples ===
Foster uses with homely examples to support his thesis that problematic situations (&quot;what is&quot;) contain the means for judging legitimate ends (&quot;what ought to be&quot;). Rational efficient means achieve rational developmental ends. Consider the problem all infants face learning to walk. They spontaneously recognize that walking is more efficient differently to crawling—an instrumental valuation of a desirable end. They learn to walk by repeatedly moving and balancing, judging the efficiency with which these means achieve their instrumental goal. When they master this new way-of-acting, they experience great satisfaction, but satisfaction is never their end-in-view.

=== Revised definition of &#x27;instrumental value&#x27; ===
To guard against contamination of instrumental value by judging means and ends independently, Foster revised his definition to embrace both.

Instrumental value is the criterion of judgment which seeks instrumentally-efficient means that &quot;work&quot; to achieve developmentally-continuous ends. This definition stresses the condition that instrumental success is never short term; it must not lead down a dead-end street. The same point is made by the currently popular concern for sustainability—a synonym for instrumental value.

Dewey&#x27;s and Foster&#x27;s argument that there is no intrinsic alternative to instrumental value continues to be ignored rather than refuted. Scholars continue to accept the possibility and necessity of knowing &quot;what ought to be&quot; independently of transient conditions that determine actual consequences of every action. Jacques Ellul and Anjan Chakravartty were prominent exponents of the truth and reality of intrinsic value as constraint on relativistic instrumental value.

==Jacques Ellul==
Jacques Ellul made scholarly contributions to many fields, but his American reputation grew out of his criticism of the autonomous authority of instrumental value, the criterion that John Dewey and J. Fagg Foster found to be the core of human rationality. He specifically criticized the valuations central to Dewey&#x27;s and Foster&#x27;s thesis: evolving instrumental technology.

His principal work, published in 1954, bore the French title &quot;La technique&quot; and tackles the problem that Dewey addressed in 1929: a culture in which the authority of evolving technology destroys traditional valuations without creating legitimate new ones. Both men agree that conditionally-efficient valuations (&quot;what is&quot;) become irrational when viewed as unconditionally efficient in themselves (&quot;what ought to be&quot;). However, while Dewey argues that contaminated instrumental valuations can be self-correcting, Ellul concludes that technology has become intrinsically destructive. The only escape from this evil is to restore authority to unconditional sacred valuations:

The English edition of &quot;La technique&quot; was published in 1964, titled &quot;The Technological Society&quot;, and quickly entered ongoing disputes in the United States over the responsibility of instrumental value for destructive social consequences. The translator of &quot;Technological Society&quot; summarizes Ellul&#x27;s thesis:

Ellul opens &quot;The Technological Society&quot; by asserting that instrumental efficiency is no longer a conditional criterion. It has become autonomous and absolute:

He blames instrumental valuations for destroying intrinsic meanings of human life: &quot;Think of our dehumanized factories, our unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from nature. Life in such an environment has no meaning.&quot; While Weber had labeled the discrediting of intrinsic valuations as &quot;disenchantment&quot;, Ellul came to label it as &quot;terrorism.&quot; He dates its domination to the 1800s, when centuries-old handicraft techniques were massively eliminated by inhuman industry.When, in the 19th century, society began to elaborate an exclusively rational technique which acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it was felt that not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind had been violated.

Culture is necessarily humanistic or it does not exist at all.… [I]t answers questions about the meaning of life, the possibility of reunion with ultimate being, the attempt to overcome human finitude, and all other questions that they have to ask and handle. But technique cannot deal with such things.… Culture exists only if it raises the question of meaning and values [valuations].… Technique is not at all concerned about the meaning of life, and it rejects any relation to values [intrinsic valuations].Ellul&#x27;s core accusation is that instrumental efficiency has become absolute, i.e., a &quot;good-in-itself&quot;; it wraps societies in a new technological milieu with six intrinsically inhuman characteristics:

# artificiality;
# autonomy, &quot;with respect to values [valuations], ideas, and the state;&quot;
# self-determinative, independent &quot;of all human intervention;&quot;
# &quot;It grows according to a process which is causal but not directed to [good] ends;&quot;
# &quot;It is formed by an accumulation of means which have established primacy over ends;&quot;
# &quot;All its parts are mutually implicated to such a degree that it is impossible to separate them or to settle any technical problems in isolation.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
Philosophers Tiles and Oberdiek (1995) find Ellul&#x27;s characterization of instrumental value inaccurate. They criticize him for anthropomorphizing and demonizing instrumental value. They counter this by examining the moral reasoning of scientists whose work led to nuclear weapons: those scientists demonstrated the capacity of instrumental judgments to provide them with a moral compass to judge nuclear technology; they were morally responsible without intrinsic rules. Tiles and Oberdiek&#x27;s conclusion coincides with that of Dewey and Foster: instrumental value, when competently applied, is self-correcting and provides humans with a developmental moral compass.For although we have defended general principles of the moral responsibilities of professional people, it would be foolish and wrongheaded to suggest codified [intrinsic] rules. It would be foolish because concrete cases are more complex and nuanced than any code could capture; it would be wrongheaded because it would suggest that our sense of moral responsibility can be fully captured by a code.

In fact, as we have seen in many instances, technology simply allows us to go on doing stupid things in clever ways. The questions that technology cannot solve, although it will always frame and condition the answers, are &quot;What should we be trying to do? What kind of lives should we, as human beings, be seeking to live? And can this kind of life be pursued without exploiting others? But until we can at least propose [instrumental] answers to those questions we cannot really begin to do sensible things in the clever ways that technology might permit.

== Semi realism (Anjan Chakravartty) ==
Anjan Chakravartty came indirectly to question the autonomous authority of instrumental value. He viewed it as a foil for the currently dominant philosophical school labeled &quot;scientific realism,&quot; with which he identifies. In 2007, he published a work defending the ultimate authority of intrinsic valuations to which realists are committed. He links the pragmatic instrumental criterion to discredited anti-realist empiricist schools including logical positivism and instrumentalism.

Chakravartty began his study with rough characterizations of realist and anti-realist valuations of theories. Anti-realists believe &quot;that theories are merely instruments for predicting observable phenomena or systematizing observation reports;&quot; they assert that theories can never report or prescribe truth or reality &quot;in itself.&quot; By contrast, scientific realists believe that theories can &quot;correctly describe both observable and unobservable parts of the world.&quot; Well-confirmed theories—&quot;what ought to be&quot; as the end of reasoning—are more than tools; they are maps of intrinsic properties of an unobservable and unconditional territory—&quot;what is&quot; as natural-but-metaphysical real kinds.

Chakravartty treats criteria of judgment as ungrounded opinion, but admits that realists apply the instrumental criterion to judge theories that &quot;work.&quot; He restricts such criterion&#x27;s scope, claiming that every instrumental judgment is &quot;inductive&quot;, &quot;heuristic&quot;, &quot;accidental&quot;. Later experience might confirm a singular judgment only if it proves to have universal validity, meaning it possesses &quot;detection properties&quot; of natural kinds. This inference is his fundamental ground for believing in intrinsic value.

He commits modern realists to three metaphysical valuations or intrinsic kinds of knowledge of truth. Competent realists affirm that natural kinds exist in a mind-independent territory possessing 1) meaningful and 2) mappable intrinsic properties.Ontologically, scientific realism is committed to the existence of a mind-independent world or reality. A realist semantics implies that the theoretical claims [valuations] about this reality have truth values, and should be construed literally.… Finally, the epistemological commitment is to the idea that these theoretical claims give us knowledge of the world. That is, predictively successful (mature, non-ad hoc) theories, taken literally as describing the nature of a mind-independent reality are (approximately) true.He labels these intrinsic valuations as &quot;semi-realist&quot;, meaning they are currently the most accurate theoretical descriptions of mind-independent natural kinds. He finds these carefully qualified statements necessary to replace earlier realist claims of intrinsic reality discredited by advancing instrumental valuations.

Science has destroyed for many people the supernatural intrinsic value embraced by Weber and Ellul. But Chakravartty defended intrinsic valuations as necessary elements of all science—belief in unobservable continuities. He advances the thesis of semi-realism, according to which well-tested theories are good maps of natural kinds, as confirmed by their instrumental success; their predictive success means they conform to mind-independent, unconditional reality.Causal properties are the fulcrum of semirealism. Their [intrinsic] relations compose the concrete structures that are the primary subject matters of a tenable scientific realism. They regularly cohere to form interesting units, and these groupings make up the particulars investigated by the sciences and described by scientific theories.

Scientific theories describe [intrinsic] causal properties, concrete structures, and particulars such as objects, events, and processes. Semirealism maintains that under certain conditions it is reasonable for realists to believe that the best of these descriptions tell us not merely about things that can be experienced with the unaided senses, but also about some of the unobservable things underlying them.Chakravartty argues that these semirealist valuations legitimize scientific theorizing about pragmatic kinds. The fact that theoretical kinds are frequently replaced does not mean that mind-independent reality is changing, but simply that theoretical maps are approximating intrinsic reality.The primary motivation for thinking that there are such things as natural kinds is the idea that carving nature according to its own divisions yields groups of objects that are capable of supporting successful inductive generalizations and prediction. So the story goes, one&#x27;s recognition of natural categories facilitates these practices, and thus furnishes an excellent explanation for their success.

The moral here is that however realists choose to construct particulars out of instances of properties, they do so on the basis of a belief in the [mind-independent] existence of those properties. That is the bedrock of realism. Property instances lend themselves to different forms of packaging [instrumental valuations], but as a feature of scientific description, this does not compromise realism with respect to the relevant [intrinsic] packages.In sum, Chakravartty argues that contingent instrumental valuations are warranted only as they approximate unchanging intrinsic valuations. Scholars continue to perfect their explanations of intrinsic value, as they deny the developmental continuity of applications of instrumental value.Abstraction is a process in which only some of the potentially many relevant factors present in [unobservable] reality are represented in a model or description with some aspect of the world, such as the nature or behavior of a specific object or process. ... Pragmatic constraints such as these play a role in shaping how scientific investigations are conducted, and together which and how many potentially relevant factors [intrinsic kinds] are incorporated into models and descriptions during the process of abstraction. The role of pragmatic constraints, however, does not undermine the idea that putative representations of factors composing abstract models can be thought to have counterparts in the [mind-independent] world.Realist intrinsic value as proposed by Chakravartty, is widely endorsed in modern scientific circles, while the supernatural intrinsic value endorsed by Max Weber and Jacques Ellul maintains its popularity throughout the world. Doubters about the reality of instrumental and intrinsic value are few.

<text>Emmanuelle Grey Rossum (born September 12, 1986) is an American actress and singer-songwriter. The accolades she has received include a Saturn Award and Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award, alongside nominations for a Golden Globe Award, an Independent Spirit Award, and two Critics&#x27; Choice Television Awards.

Born and raised in New York City, she began professionally performing as a child with the Metropolitan Opera. Early on-screen roles included &quot;Genius&quot; (1999), &quot;Songcatcher&quot; (2000), &quot;Passionada&quot; (2002), and &quot;Nola&quot; (2003). At sixteen, she was cast in her breakthrough role in &quot;Mystic River&quot; (2003). Rossum starred in the 2004 sci-fi film &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, and received critical acclaim for her performance in the leading role of Christine Daaé in the film adaptation of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (2004). She acted in the films &quot;Poseidon&quot; (2006), &quot;Dragonball: Evolution&quot; (2009), &quot;Inside&quot; (2011), &quot;Beautiful Creatures&quot; (2013), &quot;Comet&quot; (2014), &quot;You&#x27;re Not You&quot; (2014), and &quot;Cold Pursuit&quot; (2019).

In television, Rossum is best known for her portrayal of Fiona Gallagher in the television series &quot;Shameless&quot; (2011–2019). Since the mid-2010s, she has directed and produced television, including the 2022 Peacock series &quot;Angelyne&quot; in which she also stars.

In 2007, Rossum released her debut album, &quot;Inside Out&quot;. She released a Christmas EP the same year, titled &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;. In 2013, she released a follow-up album called &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;.

== Early life ==
Emmanuelle Grey Rossum was born on September 12, 1986, in New York City. She is the only child of Cheryl Rossum, a single mother who worked as a corporate photographer. Her parents separated while her mother was pregnant, and as of 2007, she had met her father only twice.

Rossum&#x27;s mother is of Russian Jewish descent, and her father is Protestant of English and Dutch ancestry. Rossum identifies as Jewish and has stated that her mother instilled in her the &quot;Jewish code of ethics and morals&quot;. She was named for her maternal great-grandfather, whose first name was Emanuel, using the feminine spelling.

Upon singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in all 12 keys, Rossum was welcomed to join the Metropolitan Opera Children&#x27;s Chorus by chorus director Elena Doria at age seven. Over the course of five years she sang onstage with the chorus and had the chance to perform with singers such as Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. For anywhere from $5 to $10 a night, Rossum sang in six languages in 20 operas, including &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Turandot&quot;, a Carnegie Hall presentation of &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;, and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. She also worked under the direction of Franco Zeffirelli in &quot;Carmen&quot;.

An increasing interest in pursuing acting led to taking classes with Flo Salant Greenberg of The New Actors Workshop in New York City. She has also worked with acting coach Terry Knickerbocker.

Rossum attended the Spence School, a private school in Manhattan, before dropping out to pursue career opportunities. She received her high school diploma at fifteen years old via online-extension courses offered by Stanford University&#x27;s Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY). She then enrolled at Columbia University, studying French, art history and philosophy.

== Career==
=== Acting ===
Rossum&#x27;s television debut was in August 1997, as the original Abigail Williams in the daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. She also had a guest role as Caroline Beels in &quot;Snoops&quot;. Rossum was nominated for a Young Artist Award in 1999 for Best Performance in a TV movie for her work in the Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Genius&quot;. She then portrayed a young Audrey Hepburn in the ABC television film &quot;The Audrey Hepburn Story&quot; (2000).

Rossum made her film debut at 13, in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Songcatcher&quot;, as Deladis Slocumb, an Appalachian orphan. Debuting at the Sundance Film Festival, the film won the Special Jury Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance. For her role, Rossum received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance and also had the opportunity to sing a duet with Dolly Parton on the &quot;Songcatcher&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Variety magazine&quot; named Rossum as &quot;One of the Ten to Watch&quot; in 2000.

In &quot;Nola&quot; (2003), Rossum played the title character, an aspiring songwriter. In her first major studio film, Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Mystic River&quot; (2003), Rossum starred as Katie Markum, the ill-fated daughter of small-business owner Jimmy Markum, played by Sean Penn.

Rossum had a breakthrough role as Laura Chapman in the sci-fi-disaster film &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2004). She later returned to New York, where she was the last to audition, in full costume and make-up, for the role of Christine Daaé in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (2004), the onscreen adaptation of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical of the same name. After having nearly missed the audition due to a family engagement, Rossum was asked to audition in person for Lloyd Webber at his home in New York. For her performance, Rossum received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a musical or comedy. She also received a Critics&#x27; Choice Award for Best Young Actress, along with a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor.

In 2006, Rossum appeared in &quot;Poseidon&quot;, Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s remake of the disaster film &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;. She played Jennifer Ramsey, the daughter of Kurt Russell&#x27;s character. Rossum described the character as being proactive and strong in all situations, rather than a damsel in distress. Rossum also appeared as Juliet Capulet in a 2006 Williamstown Theatre Festival production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In early 2009, Rossum appeared in the poorly received &quot;Dragonball Evolution&quot;. Her next big screen venture was the indie &quot;Dare&quot;, which was an official selection of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. In November 2009, Rossum appeared in Broadway&#x27;s 24 Hour Plays in which actors, writers, and directors collaborate to produce, and perform six one-act plays within 24 hours to benefit the Urban Arts Partnership. Rossum appeared in Warren Leight&#x27;s &quot;Daily Bread&quot;, directed by Lucie Tiberghien.

In December 2009, Rossum joined the cast of the Showtime dramedy series &quot;Shameless&quot;, based on the British series of the same title. The series co-stars William H. Macy. Rossum plays the oldest sister of a large, motherless family, functioning as a guardian/surrogate mother to her five younger siblings. The series has received consistent acclaim, with Rossum&#x27;s performance being universally praised. She made her directorial debut with episode four of season seven, &quot;I Am a Storm.&quot; In December 2016, Rossum was in a contract dispute with the show&#x27;s producers over her desire for a salary equal to that of co-star Macy and back pay for the differential over seven seasons, which was resolved later that month. Following this news, &quot;Shameless&quot; was renewed for its eighth season beginning production in 2017. In August 2018, Rossum announced her departure from &quot;Shameless&quot; after nine seasons.

In mid-2011, Rossum starred in D. J. Caruso&#x27;s social film, &quot;Inside&quot;; the online film aired in several segments, incorporating multiple social media platforms including Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. The following year, Rossum played Ridley, a siren Caster in &quot;Beautiful Creatures&quot; (2013), based on the young adult fantasy novel of the same name. Although the film was released to mixed reviews, Rossum&#x27;s performance was praised by critics and fans. She also starred in the drama &quot;You&#x27;re Not You&quot; as Bec, an inexperienced caregiver who looks after and befriends Kate (Hilary Swank), who suffers from the degenerative disease ALS. By June 2013, Rossum was cast as the female lead opposite Justin Long in the independent romantic comedy &quot;Comet&quot;, which was directed by Sam Esmail, to whom she later became engaged. Afterward she appeared in the film &quot;Before I Disappear&quot; (2014), based on the Academy Award-winning short film &quot;Curfew&quot;.

In 2019, it was announced that Rossum would star in &quot;Angelyne&quot;, a drama series co-produced by her husband and longtime collaborator Sam Esmail, for Peacock, the new streaming service by NBC. The limited series was her first lead role after &quot;Shameless&quot; and was based on &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; senior writer Gary Baum&#x27;s investigative feature on the LA billboard model Angelyne.

=== Music ===
After her role in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, Rossum was offered several deals to record Classical music albums, but refused, opting to create an album of contemporary, more mainstream music. She explained it by feeling frustrated because of the lack of &quot;emotional honesty&quot; in music played in radios. Regarding the sound and style of her music, she said, &quot;It&#x27;s pop music, but not Britney Spears bubblegum pop. I want it to have a David Gray or Annie Lennox feel. I&#x27;ve been spending up to 12 hours a day in the studio.&quot; Rossum cites Sarah McLachlan, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Faith Hill as some of her influences.
Rossum&#x27;s album &quot;Inside Out&quot; was produced by Stuart Brawley. It was released on October 23, 2007, and peaked at 199 in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. For the promotion of the record, Geffen Records featured the song, &quot;Slow Me Down,&quot; as part of the second volume of Hollywood Records&#x27; &quot;Girl Next&quot; compilation album, which was released on July 10, 2007. Later that year, she was chosen as Yahoo&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; artist of the month and a &quot;One to Watch&quot; by MSN. In December 2007, Rossum released three Christmas songs on the EP &quot;Carol of the Bells. &quot;It was also this year that Rossum sang the national anthem at the Save Mart 350 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series race at Infineon Raceway and performed at the first ever Perez Hilton Presents event at the El Rey Theatre in Hollywood. On October 27, 2007, Rossum again sang the national anthem at the New Jersey Devils&#x27;s first home game of the 2007–08 NHL season, which was also the first game the team played in the newly constructed Prudential Center. She also performed at the Hollywood Christmas Celebration at the Grove in Los Angeles and the Lighting of the Great Tree in Atlanta, Georgia.

She joined Counting Crows, Augustana, and Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead as a &quot;special guest&quot; for select performances of the &quot;Traveling Circus and Medicine Show&quot; tour in early 2009.

In 2010, Rossum sang a song called &quot;Cruel One&quot; on singer Alex Band&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;We&#x27;ve All Been There&quot;. On the track she sings with Band, and Chantal Kreviazuk.

Rossum released the Warner Bros. Records album &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; on January 29, 2013. Unlike &quot;Inside Out&quot; on which Rossum wrote the songs herself, the album is a collection of covers of songs from the 1920s to 1960s. &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; peaked at 92 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and number one in Jazz Albums.

Rossum describes herself as a lyric soprano, while saying her voice is still developing. She continues to train vocally at ZajacStudio, a studio run by soprano Joann C. Zajac.

==Charity work and advocacy==
Rossum was a YouthAIDS ambassador. In 2008, she was signed as the spokesperson for Pinkitude, an apparel line inspired by the Pink Panther character, to help raise breast cancer awareness. In 2010, she appeared in public service announcements for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Action Fund. She also works with Global Green USA to raise money for environmental protection and awareness of ecological issues. In 2015, Rossum campaigned with the Best Friends Animal Society to encourage animal adoption.

On May 26, 2009, Rossum attended a march in West Hollywood California protesting the California Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling to uphold Proposition 8.

In February 2024, Rossum was one of 400 celebrities who signed an open letter by Creative Community for Peace denouncing attempts to remove Israel from Eurovision 2024 amid the Israel-Hamas war.

== Personal life ==

Rossum married Justin Siegel in February 2008, although they publicly presented themselves as in an unmarried relationship. 19 months later, in September 2009, he filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on December 28, 2010.

In 2013, Rossum began dating writer/director Sam Esmail. They got engaged two years later, in August 2015. They married on May 29, 2017, at a Reform synagogue in New York City. The couple has two children: a daughter, born May 2021, and a son, born April 2023.

Rossum has coeliac disease and predominantly hyperactive ADHD, and has been on medication for the latter since childhood.

The designer Vera Wang was married to Rossum&#x27;s cousin, investor and real-estate developer Arthur P. Becker from 1989 to 2012. Rossum has described herself as &quot;a spiritual person, but not especially religious.&quot;

<text>The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins is a children&#x27;s book, written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and published by Vanguard Press in 1938. Unlike the majority of Geisel&#x27;s books, it is written in prose rather than rhyming and metered verse. Geisel, who was a collector of hats, got the idea for the story when he was on a commuter train from New York to New England, while sitting behind a businessman wearing a hat. 
The businessman was so stiff and formal that Geisel idly wondered what would happen if he took the man&#x27;s hat and threw it out the window, and he artistically, albeit erroneously, concluded that the man would &quot;simply grow a new one&quot;.

The characters of Bartholomew and King Derwin returned a decade later in &quot;Bartholomew and the Oobleck&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Set in feudal times, the story begins in the Kingdom of Didd. A young peasant boy named Bartholomew Cubbins lives on the outskirts of the kingdom with his family; he wears a simple red hat with a single white feather that has been in his family for generations. One day, Bartholomew goes into the town to sell some cranberries, when he comes across King Derwin, the ruler of the Kingdom of Didd, riding through a street. As per law, one is supposed to remove his/her hat when the king passes by, but although Bartholomew does remove his hat, despite having it in his hand, the king points out and orders him to remove an identical hat on his head. Bartholomew does so repeatedly, but a new hat appears on his head every time.

The boy is taken to the palace, where numerous people attempt to remove the hat from Bartholomew&#x27;s head, but all attempts end in failure. The royal hatter runs away in terror; the King’s wise men only nibble their beards in awe; the King&#x27;s young nephew, Wilfred, fails to shoot the hats off with arrows; a great bowman similarly fails with a longbow; and the royal magicians attempt to curse the hat away, but claim that their spell will only work in &quot;Ten Short Years&quot;. The King, exasperated by all the attempts, orders Bartholomew to be executed, but the sentence cannot be carried out because the law forbids the execution of anyone wearing a hat.

Wilfred subsequently suggests throwing Bartholomew from the highest tower as punishment. The King, though mildly upset by the idea, agrees. Bartholomew begins pushing his hats off rapidly as they climb the tower; as this continues, the hats begin to grow in extravagance and beauty from the 451st hat onwards - the 451st hat has two feathers, the 452nd hat has three, the 453rd hat has three feathers and a small gem, and so on. Ultimately, the 500th hat is revealed as the greatest, studded with a massive gem and feathers from rare birds, although Bartholomew seems unaware of the fact. The king is stunned by the beauty of the hat, but Wilfred is more incensed than before at the sight of it. He tries to push Bartholomew off the tower against the King&#x27;s wishes, but the King saves Bartholomew&#x27;s life by spanking Wilfred as a punishment. King Derwin then grants Bartholomew a reprieve, requesting all 500 hats, (the 500th being, to Bartholomew’s joy, the final hat), in exchange for 500 gold coins. Bartholomew agrees, and is sent home with his massive reward, while the King keeps all the hats in a massive display case to admire for years to come. The story ends with the narrator explaining that nobody in the Kingdom of Didd ever figured out how the hats kept appearing on Bartholomew&#x27;s head, and that &quot;they could only say it just &#x27;happened to happen&#x27; and was not very likely to happen again.&quot;

==Reception==
The book received positive reviews from critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer called the book &quot;a lovely bit of tomfoolery which keeps up the suspense and surprise until the end&quot;. &quot;Booklist&quot;, which had criticized Geisel&#x27;s previous book, &quot;And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street&quot;, for containing only enough material for one comic strip, praised &quot;The 500 Hats&quot; as &quot;a brand-new idea, developed into a complete tale, not too long, not too short, just right. Somewhere between the Sunday supplements and the Brothers Grimm, Dr. Seuss has produced a picture book combining features of both&quot;. Alexander Laing, who had worked with Geisel on the &quot;Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern&quot; humor magazine, wrote in his review of the book in the &quot;Dartmouth Alumni Magazine&quot;: &quot;His several other occupations, madly fascinating as they are, may have been only preludes to a discovery of his proper vocation. That he is a rare and loopy genius has been common knowledge from an early epoch of his undergrad troubles. It now becomes plain that his is the self-consistent, happy madness beloved by children. I do not see what is to prevent him from becoming the Grimm of our times&quot;.

==Adaptations==
* Not long after publication, the story was adapted for an album issued by RCA Victor (Y-339). Narrated by Paul Wing, the audio adaptation had a running time of 13 minutes and 37 seconds. The dramatization featured music and sound effects on two 10&quot; 78 rpm records in a bi-fold sleeve. 
* Geisel wrote the script for the 1943 &quot;Puppetoons&quot; short of the same name for Paramount Pictures, which was produced by George Pal. It also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Unlike the book&#x27;s illustrations, in which Cubbins&#x27; hats were all the same one, the hats in the film were of many different kinds.
* Minnesota&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Theatre Company produced a version of &quot;The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins&quot; for the stage in its 1979–1980 season, and says this was the first theater adaptation of a Dr. Seuss work.

<text>The Rungrado 1st of May Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium occupying an area of on Rungra Island, Pyongyang, North Korea. It opened on 1 May 1989, with its first major event being the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. It is the 
second largest stadium in the world by seating capacity, after Narendra Modi Stadium. The stadium can officially hold up to a maximum of 114,000 spectators.

==Uses==
The stadium is and currently used for football matches, a few athletics events, and most often for the mass games of the Arirang Festival.

==Design==
The stadium&#x27;s scalloped roof features 16 arches arranged in a ring, and resembles a magnolia blossom. It hosts events on a main pitch covering . Its total floor space is over across eight stories, and the lobes of its roof peak at more than above the ground. The stadium was originally built with an official capacity of 150,000. After a 2014 remodel which included the replacement of some bench seating with individual seats, observers estimated a new capacity of approximately 114,000. It was later confirmed in November 2022 that the stadium is still expandable up to 150,000.

==History==
After the 1988 Summer Olympics had been awarded to Seoul, North Korea intensified its efforts to present itself as the legitimate Korean state. As part of these efforts, it successfully bid to organize the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in Pyongyang in 1989. Massive construction projects were initiated in preparation for the festival, one of which was the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium. At the time of completion, it was the largest stadium ever built in Asia.

While the stadium is used for sporting events, it is more frequently the site of massive performances and shows celebrating President Kim Il Sung and the North Korean nation. In June–July 2002, it was the site of the giant Arirang Festival gymnastic and artistic performance. The extravaganza involved over 100,000 participants—double the number of spectators, and was open to foreigners. These performances are now an annual feature in Pyongyang, usually in August and September. The event was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records in 2007 as the largest gymnastics display ever, with 100,090 participants.

Collision in Korea, the largest professional wrestling pay-per-view event ever, was held at Rungrado Stadium on 28–29 April 1995. Attendance was 150,000 and 190,000, respectively, according to local authorities.

After a two-year renovation project, the stadium reopened in 2015. In July 2017, the Rungrado Stadium played host to six group stage matches as part of 2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification.

In the September 2018 inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea gave a speech with Chairman Kim Jong Un to 150,000 North Korean spectators. The speech has themes of unification, peace, and cooperation.

In July 2019, Kim Jong Un hosted Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping to a special Grand Mass Gymnastics and Artistic performance called &quot;Invincible Socialism&quot;, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of China–North Korea relations.

On 31 December 2022, a concert was held on the grounds of the stadium, commemorating the New Year&#x27;s Eve, which was presided over by Kim Jong Un and along with other high-profile Workers&#x27; Party of Korea officials.
