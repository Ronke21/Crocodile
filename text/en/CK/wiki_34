<text>Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji (born Leon Dudley Sorabji; 14 August 1892 – 15 October 1988) was an English composer, music critic, pianist and writer whose music, written over a period of seventy years, ranges from sets of miniatures to works lasting several hours. One of the most prolific 20th-century composers, he is best known for his piano pieces, notably nocturnes such as &quot;Gulistān&quot; and &quot;Villa Tasca&quot;, and large-scale, technically intricate compositions, which include seven symphonies for piano solo, four toccatas, &quot;Sequentia cyclica&quot; and &quot;100 Transcendental Studies&quot;. He felt alienated from English society by reason of his homosexuality and mixed ancestry, and had a lifelong tendency to seclusion.

Sorabji was educated privately. His mother was English and his father a Parsi businessman and industrialist from India, who set up a trust fund that freed his family from the need to work. Although Sorabji was a reluctant performer and not a virtuoso, he played some of his music publicly between 1920 and 1936. In the late 1930s, his attitude shifted and he imposed restrictions on performance of his works, which he lifted in 1976. His compositions received little exposure in those years and he remained in public view mainly through his writings, which include the books &quot;Around Music&quot; and &quot;Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician&quot;. During this time, he also left London and eventually settled in the village of Corfe Castle, Dorset. Information on Sorabji&#x27;s life, especially his later years, is scarce, with most of it coming from the letters he exchanged with his friends.

As a composer, Sorabji was largely self-taught. Although he was attracted to modernist aesthetics at first, he later dismissed much of the established and contemporary repertoire. He drew on such diverse influences as Ferruccio Busoni, Claude Debussy and Karol Szymanowski and developed a style blending baroque forms with frequent polyrhythms, interplay of tonal and atonal elements and lavish ornamentation. Though he composed mostly for the piano and has been likened to the composer-pianists he admired, including Franz Liszt and Charles-Valentin Alkan, he also wrote orchestral, chamber and organ pieces. His harmonic language and complex rhythms anticipated works from the mid-20th century onwards, and while his music remained largely unpublished until the early 2000s, interest in it has grown since then.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===

Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji was born in Chingford, Essex (now Greater London), on 14 August 1892. His father, Shapurji Sorabji (1863–1932), was a Parsi civil engineer born in Bombay, India. Like many of his near ancestors, he was an industrialist and businessman. Sorabji&#x27;s mother, Madeline Matilda Worthy (1866–1959), was English and born in Camberwell, Surrey (now South London). She is said to have been a singer, pianist and organist, but there is little evidence of this. They married on 18 February 1892 and Sorabji was their only child.

Little is known of Sorabji&#x27;s early life and musical beginnings. He reportedly started to learn the piano from his mother when he was eight, and he later received help from Emily Edroff-Smith, a musician and piano teacher who was a friend of his mother&#x27;s. Sorabji attended a school of about twenty boys where, in addition to general education, he took music lessons in piano, organ and harmony, as well as language classes for German and Italian. He was also educated by his mother, who took him to concerts.

=== Entering the music world (1913–1936) ===
The first major insight into Sorabji&#x27;s life comes from his correspondence with the composer and critic Peter Warlock, which began in 1913. Warlock inspired Sorabji to become a music critic and focus on composition. Sorabji had obtained a matriculation but decided to study music privately, as Warlock&#x27;s claims about universities made him abandon his plan of going to one. Thus, from the early 1910s until 1916, Sorabji studied music with the pianist and composer Charles A. Trew. Around this time, he came to be close to and exchanged ideas with the composers Bernard van Dieren and Cecil Gray, who were friends with Warlock. For unknown reasons, Sorabji was not conscripted during World War I, and though he later praised conscientious objectors for their courage, there is no proof he tried to register as one.
Sorabji&#x27;s letters from this time document his nascent feelings of otherness, the sense of alienation that he as a homosexual of mixed ancestry experienced and his development of a non-English identity. Sorabji joined the Parsi community in 1913 or 1914 by attending a Navjote ceremony (probably performed in his home by a priest) and changed his name. He had apparently been mistreated by other boys in the school he attended and his tutor, who sought to make an English gentleman out of him, would make derogatory comments about India and hit him on the head with a large book, which gave him recurring headaches. Sorabji said that in 1914, a &quot;howling mob&quot; with brickbats and large stones pursued him and &quot;half killed&quot; him. These experiences have been identified as the root of his dislike of England, and he was soon to describe English people as intentionally and systematically mistreating foreigners.

In late 1919, Warlock sent the music critic Ernest Newman several of Sorabji&#x27;s scores, including his First Piano Sonata. Newman ignored them, and in November that year, Sorabji privately met the composer Ferruccio Busoni and played the piece for him. Busoni expressed reservations about the work but gave him a letter of recommendation, which helped Sorabji get it published. Warlock and Sorabji then publicly accused Newman of systematic avoidance and sabotage, which led the critic to detail why he could not meet Sorabji or review his scores. Warlock proceeded to call Newman&#x27;s behaviour abusive and stubborn, and the issue was settled after the journal &quot;Musical Opinion&quot; reproduced correspondence between Sorabji and Newman.

Sorabji has been called a late starter, as he had not composed music before the age of 22. Already before picking up the craft of composition, he had been drawn to recent developments in art music at a time when they did not receive much attention in England. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. The modernist style, increasingly longer durations and technical complexity of his works baffled critics and audiences. Although his music had its detractors, some musicians received it positively: after hearing Sorabji&#x27;s &quot;Le jardin parfumé—Poem for Piano Solo&quot; in 1930, the English composer Frederick Delius sent him a letter admiring the piece&#x27;s &quot;real sensuous beauty&quot;, and around the 1920s, the French pianist Alfred Cortot and the Austrian composer Alban Berg took an interest in his work.

Sorabji first played his music publicly in 1920 and he gave occasional performances of his works in Europe over the next decade. In the mid-1920s, he befriended the composer Erik Chisholm, which led to the most fruitful period of his pianistic career. Their correspondence began in 1926 and they first met in April 1930 in Glasgow, Scotland. Later that year, Sorabji joined Chisholm&#x27;s recently created Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music, whose concerts featured a number of distinguished composers and musicians. Despite Sorabji&#x27;s protestations that he was &quot;a composer—who &quot;incidentally&quot;, &quot;merely&quot;, plays the piano&quot;, he was the guest performer to make the most appearances in the series. He came to Glasgow four times and played some of the longest works he had written to date: he premiered &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot; and his Fourth Sonata in 1930 and his &quot;Toccata seconda&quot; in 1936, and he gave a performance of &quot;Nocturne, &quot;Jāmī&quot;&quot; in 1931.

=== Years of seclusion ===

==== Ups and downs in life and music (1936–1949) ====
On 10 March 1936 in London, the pianist John Tobin played a portion of &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot;. The performance lasted 90 minutes—twice as long as it should have. Sorabji left before it finished and denied having attended, paid for, or supported the performance. A number of leading critics and composers attended the concert and wrote negative critiques in the press, which severely damaged Sorabji&#x27;s reputation. Sorabji gave the premiere of his &quot;Toccata seconda&quot; in December 1936, which became his last public appearance. Three months earlier, he had said he was no longer interested in performances of his works, and over the next decade, made remarks expressing his opposition to the spread of his music.

Sorabji eventually placed restrictions on performances of his works. These became known as a &quot;ban&quot;, but there was no official or enforceable pronouncement to this effect; rather, he discouraged others from playing his music publicly. This was not without precedent and even his first printed scores bore a note reserving the right of performance. Few concerts with his music—most of them semi-private or given by his friends and with his approval—took place in those years, and he turned down offers to play his works in public. His withdrawal from the world of music has usually been ascribed to Tobin&#x27;s recital, but other reasons have been put forward for his decision, including the deaths of people he admired (such as Busoni) and the increasing prominence of Igor Stravinsky and twelve-tone composition. Nonetheless, the 1930s marked an especially fertile period in Sorabji&#x27;s career: he created many of his largest works and his activity as a music critic peaked. In 1938, Oxford University Press became the agent for his published works until his death in 1988.

A major factor in Sorabji&#x27;s change of attitude was his financial situation. Sorabji&#x27;s father had returned to Bombay after his marriage in 1892, where he played an important role in the development of India&#x27;s engineering and cotton machinery industries. He was musically cultured and financed the publication of 14 of Sorabji&#x27;s compositions between 1921 and 1931, although there is little evidence that he lived with the family, and he did not want his son to become a musician. In October 1914, Sorabji&#x27;s father set up the Shapurji Sorabji Trust, a trust fund that would provide his family with a life income that would free them of the need to work. Sorabji&#x27;s father, affected by the fall of the pound and rupee in 1931, stopped supporting the publication of Sorabji&#x27;s scores that same year, and died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 7 July 1932. Following an initial trip to India, Sorabji&#x27;s second one (lasting from May 1933 to January 1934) revealed that his father had been living with another woman since 1905 and had married her in 1929. Sorabji and his mother were excluded from his will and received a fraction of what his Indian heirs did. An action was instituted around 1936 and the bigamous marriage was declared null and void by a court in 1949, but the financial assets could not be retrieved.

Sorabji countered the uncertainty that he experienced during this time by taking up yoga. He credited it with helping him command inspiration and achieve focus and self-discipline, and wrote that his life, once &quot;chaotic, without form or shape&quot;, now had &quot;an ordered pattern and design&quot;. The practice inspired him to write an essay titled &quot;Yoga and the Composer&quot; and compose the &quot;Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone&quot; (1938–39), which has seven movements titled after bodily centres in tantric and shaktic yoga.

Sorabji did not perform military or civic duties during World War II, a fact that has been attributed to his individualism. His open letters and music criticism did not cease, and he never touched the topic of war in his writings. Many of Sorabji&#x27;s &quot;100 Transcendental Studies&quot; (1940–1944) were written during German bombings, and he composed during the night and early morning in his home at Clarence Gate Gardens (Marylebone, London) even as most other blocks were abandoned. Wartime records show that a high explosive bomb hit Siddons Lane, where the back entrance to his former place of residence is located.

==== Admirers and inner withdrawal (1950–1968) ====

In 1950, Sorabji left London, and in 1956, he settled in The Eye, a house that he had built for himself in the village of Corfe Castle, Dorset. He had been on holidays in Corfe Castle since 1928 and the place had appealed to him for many years. In 1946, he expressed the desire to be there permanently, and once settled in the village, he rarely ventured outside. While Sorabji felt despised by the English music establishment, the main target of his ire was London, which he called the &quot;International Human Rubbish dump&quot; and &quot;Spivopolis&quot; (a reference to the term &quot;spiv&quot;). Living expenses also played a role in his decision to leave the city. As a critic, he earned no money, and while his lifestyle was modest, he sometimes found himself in financial difficulties. Sorabji had a strong emotional attachment to his mother, which has been partly attributed to being abandoned by his father and the impact this had on their financial security. She accompanied him on his travels and he spent nearly two-thirds of his life with her until the 1950s. He also looked after his mother in her last years when they were no longer together.

Despite his social isolation and withdrawal from the world of music, Sorabji retained a circle of close admirers. Concerns over the fate of his music gradually intensified, as Sorabji did not record any of his works and none of them had been published since 1931. The most ambitious attempt to preserve his legacy was initiated by Frank Holliday, an English trainer and teacher who met Sorabji in 1937 and was his closest friend for about four decades. From 1951 to 1953, Holliday organised the presentation of a letter inviting Sorabji to make recordings of his own music. Sorabji received the letter, signed by 23 admirers, soon after, but made no recordings then, in spite of the enclosed cheque for 121 guineas (). Sorabji was concerned by the impact copyright laws would have on the spread of his music, but Holliday eventually persuaded him after years of opposition, objections and stalling. A little over 11 hours of music were recorded in Sorabji&#x27;s home between 1962 and 1968. Although the tapes were not intended for public circulation, leaks occurred and some of the recordings were included in a 55-minute WBAI broadcast from 1969 and a three-hour programme produced by WNCN in 1970. The latter was broadcast several times in the 1970s and helped in the dissemination and understanding of Sorabji&#x27;s music.
Sorabji and Holliday&#x27;s friendship ended in 1979 because of a perceived rift between them and disagreements over custodianship of Sorabji&#x27;s legacy. Unlike Sorabji, who proceeded to destroy much of their correspondence, Holliday preserved his collection of Sorabji&#x27;s letters and other related items, which is one of the largest and most important sources of material on the composer. He took many notes during his visits to Sorabji and often accepted everything he told him at face value. The collection was purchased by McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) in 1988.

Another devoted admirer was Norman Pierre Gentieu, an American writer who discovered Sorabji after reading his book &quot;Around Music&quot; (1932). Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions in response to post-war shortages in England, and he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s, Gentieu offered to pay for the expenses to microfilm Sorabji&#x27;s major piano works and provide copies to selected libraries. In 1952, Gentieu set up a mock society (the Society of Connoisseurs) to mask the financial investment on his part, but Sorabji suspected that it was a hoax. Microfilming (which encompassed all of Sorabji&#x27;s unpublished musical manuscripts) began in January 1953 and continued until 1967 as new works were produced. Copies of the microfilms became available in several libraries and universities in the United States and South Africa.

Over the years, Sorabji grew increasingly tired of composition; health problems, stress and fatigue interfered and he began to loathe writing music. After the &quot;Messa grande sinfonica&quot; (1955–61)—which comprises 1,001 pages of orchestral score—was completed, Sorabji wrote he had no desire to continue composing, and in August 1962, he suggested he might abandon composition and destroy his extant manuscripts. Extreme anxiety and exhaustion caused by personal, family and other issues, including the private recordings and preparing for them, had drained him and he took a break from composition. He eventually returned to it, but worked at a slower pace than before and produced mostly short works. In 1968, he stopped composing and said he would not write any more music. Documentation of how he spent the next few years is unavailable and his production of open letters declined.

=== Renewed visibility (1969–1979) ===
In November 1969, the composer Alistair Hinton, then a student at the Royal College of Music in London, discovered Sorabji&#x27;s music in the Westminster Music Library and wrote a letter to him in March 1972. They met for the first time in Sorabji&#x27;s home on 21 August 1972 and quickly became good friends; Sorabji began to turn to Hinton for advice on legal and other matters. In 1978, Hinton and the musicologist Paul Rapoport microfilmed Sorabji&#x27;s manuscripts that did not have copies made, and in 1979 Sorabji wrote a new will that bequeathed Hinton (now his literary and musical executor) all the manuscripts in his possession. Sorabji, who had not written any music since 1968, returned to composition in 1973 owing to Hinton&#x27;s interest in his work. Hinton also persuaded Sorabji to give Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public, which was granted on 24 March 1976 and marked the end of the &quot;ban&quot;, although another pianist, Michael Habermann, may have received tentative approval at an earlier date. Recitals with Sorabji&#x27;s music became more common, leading him to join the Performing Right Society and derive a small income from royalties.

In 1977, a television documentary on Sorabji was produced and broadcast. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; Sorabji did not wish to be seen and there was just one brief shot of him waving to the departing camera crew. In 1979, he appeared on BBC Scotland for the 100th birthday of Francis George Scott, and on BBC Radio 3 to commemorate Nikolai Medtner&#x27;s centenary. The former broadcast led to Sorabji&#x27;s first meeting with Ronald Stevenson, whom he had known and admired for more than 20 years. Shortly after, Sorabji received a commission from Gentieu (who acted on behalf of the Philadelphia branch of the Delius Society) and fulfilled it by writing &quot;Il tessuto d&#x27;arabeschi&quot; (1979) for flute and string quartet. He dedicated it &quot;To the memory of Delius&quot; and was paid £1,000 ().

=== Last years ===

Sorabji completed his final piece, &quot;Due sutras sul nome dell&#x27;amico Alexis&quot;, in 1984, and stopped composing afterwards because of his failing eyesight and struggle to physically write. His health deteriorated severely in 1986, which obliged him to abandon his home and spend several months in a Wareham hospital; in the October of that year, he put Hinton (his sole heir) in charge of his personal affairs. By this time, the Shapurji Sorabji Trust had been exhausted and his house, along with his belongings (including some 3,000 books), was put up for auction in November 1986. In March 1987, he moved into Marley House Nursing Home, a private nursing home in Winfrith Newburgh (near Dorchester, Dorset), where he was permanently chairbound and received daily nursing care. In June 1988, he suffered a mild stroke, which left him slightly mentally impaired. He died of heart failure and arteriosclerotic heart disease on 15 October 1988 at the age of 96. He was cremated in Bournemouth Crematorium on 24 October, and the funeral service took place in Corfe Castle in the Church of St. Edward, King and Martyr, on the same day. His remains are buried in &quot;God&#x27;s Acre&quot;, the Corfe Castle cemetery.

== Personal life ==

=== Myths and reputation ===

During Sorabji&#x27;s lifetime and since his death, myths about him have circulated. To dispel them, scholars have focused on his compositional method, his skills as a performer, the dimensions and complexity of his pieces and other topics. It has proven to be a challenging task: while nearly all of Sorabji&#x27;s known works have been preserved and there are almost no lost manuscripts, few documents and items relating to his life have survived. His correspondence with his friends is the main source of information on this area, though much of it is missing, as Sorabji often discarded large volumes of his letters without inspecting their content. , the author of Sorabji&#x27;s first biography, &quot;Opus sorabjianum&quot;, writes that &quot;there are years for which hardly anything can be reported&quot;.

Sorabji peddled some myths himself. He claimed to have had relatives in the upper echelons of the Catholic Church and wore a ring that he said had belonged to a deceased Sicilian cardinal and would go to the Pope upon his death. The villagers in Corfe Castle sometimes referred to him as &quot;Sir Abji&quot; and &quot;Indian Prince&quot;. Sorabji often gave lexicographers incorrect biographical information on himself. One of them, Nicolas Slonimsky, who in 1978 erroneously wrote that Sorabji owned a castle, once called him &quot;the most enigmatic composer now living&quot;.

Sorabji&#x27;s mother had long been believed to have been Spanish-Sicilian, but the Sorabji scholar Sean Vaughn Owen has shown she was born to English parents christened in an Anglican church. He found that she often spread falsehoods and suggested this influenced Sorabji, who made a habit out of misleading others. Owen concludes that despite Sorabji&#x27;s elitist and misanthropic image, his acquaintances found him serious and stern but generous, cordial and hospitable. He summarises the tensions displayed in Sorabji&#x27;s reputation, writings, persona and behaviour thus:

The contradictions between his reputation and the actuality of his existence were known to Sorabji and they appear to have given him much amusement. This sense of humour was detected by many in the village, yet they too were prone to believe his stories. The papal connection ... was a particular favourite and as much as Sorabji detested being spotlighted in a large group, he was perfectly content in more intimate situations bringing direct attention to his ring or his thorny attitude regarding the ban on his music.

=== Sexuality ===

In 1919, Sorabji experienced a &quot;sexual awakening&quot;, which led him to join the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology and the English branch of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft. In the early 1920s, at a time of considerable emotional distress, he consulted Havelock Ellis, a writer on sexual psychology, on the matter of his orientation. Ellis held progressive views on the subject and Sorabji inscribed a dedication &quot;To Dr. Havelock Ellis.—in respectful admiration, homage and gratitude&quot; in his Piano Concerto No. 7 (1924). He went on to reference Ellis in many of his articles, often building on the concept of sexual inversion.

Although Sorabji&#x27;s homosexual tendencies were first exhibited in his letters to Warlock in 1914, they manifested most strongly in his correspondence with Chisholm. Sorabji sent him a number of exceptionally long letters that captured a desire for intimacy and to be with him alone, and have been interpreted as expressing Sorabji&#x27;s love for him. Chisholm got married in 1932 and apparently rebuffed him around this time, after which Sorabji&#x27;s letters to him became less sentimental and more infrequent.

Sorabji spent approximately the last 35 years of his life with Reginald Norman Best (1909–1988), the son of his mother&#x27;s friend. Best spent his life savings to help Sorabji buy The Eye and shared the costs of living with him. He was homosexual, and although Sorabji often described him as his godson, many suspected there was more to their relationship and those close to them believed they were partners. Sorabji once called him &quot;one of the two people on earth most precious to me&quot;. In March 1987, they moved into Marley House Nursing Home, where Sorabji called him &quot;darling&quot; and complimented him on his looks before Best&#x27;s death on 29 February 1988, an event described as a blow to the composer. Sorabji suffered a mild stroke in June and died later that year; their ashes are buried beside each other.

Sorabji&#x27;s writings include &quot;Gianandrea and Stephen&quot;, a short homoerotic story set in the Italian city of Palermo. Though the text purports to be biographical, Roberge considers most of it a fabrication. He nevertheless argues that Sorabji probably had sexual encounters with men while he lived in London, citing a letter in which he wrote, &quot;deep affection and indeed &quot;love&quot; between men is the &quot;greatest thing in life&quot;, at any rate it is &quot;in my life&quot;&quot;. He suggests that Sorabji often felt lonely, which led him &quot;to create for himself an ideal world in which he could believe—and have his friends believe&quot;.

=== Social life ===
Many of Sorabji&#x27;s friends were not musicians and he said that their human qualities meant more to him than their musical erudition. He sought warmth in others and said he depended emotionally on his friends&#x27; affection. He could be extremely devoted to them, though he admitted to preferring solitude. Some of his friendships, like those with Norman Peterkin or Hinton, lasted until the death of either party; others were broken. Though Sorabji had often reserved harsh words for the English, in the 1950s, he conceded he had not been objective in so doing and acknowledged that many of his close friends were or had been Englishmen.

Best, Sorabji&#x27;s companion, suffered from depression and multiple congenital deficiencies. Around 1970, he began taking electroconvulsive therapy, which caused him considerable anxiety. Sorabji was upset by this and Owen believes that the treatment and Best&#x27;s mental health problems exacerbated their reclusiveness. Sorabji cherished his privacy (even describing himself as a &quot;claustrophiliac&quot;) and has often been called a misanthrope. He planted more than 250 trees around his house, which had a number of notices to deter uninvited visitors. Sorabji did not like the company of two or more friends simultaneously and would accept only one at a time, each about once or twice per year. In an unpublished text titled &quot;The Fruits of Misanthropy&quot;, he justified his reclusiveness by saying, &quot;my own failings are so great that they are as much as I can put up with in comfort—those of other people superadded I find a burden quite intolerable&quot;.

=== Religious views ===
Sorabji had an interest in the occult, numerology and related topics; Rapoport suggested that Sorabji chose to hide his year of birth for fear that it could be used against him. Early in his life, Sorabji published articles on the paranormal and he included occult inscriptions and references in his works. In 1922, he met the occultist Aleister Crowley, whom he shortly after dismissed as a &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;the dullest of dull dogs&quot;. He also maintained a 20-year friendship with Bernard Bromage, an English writer on mysticism. Bromage acted as joint trustee of the Shapurji Sorabji Trust between 1933 and 1941 and produced a defective index for Sorabji&#x27;s book &quot;Around Music&quot;, which the composer was displeased with. He also apparently behaved incorrectly as trustee, causing Sorabji considerable monetary losses, which led to his removal from the Trust and the end of their friendship around 1942. Occult themes rarely appeared in Sorabji&#x27;s music and writings afterwards.

Sorabji spoke favourably of the Parsis, though his experiences with them in India in the 1930s upset him. He embraced only a few aspects of Zoroastrianism before cutting his ties to various Parsi and Zoroastrian organisations over objections to their actions. However, he retained an interest in his Persian heritage, and insisted that his body should be cremated after his death (which is an alternative to using the Tower of Silence).

Sorabji&#x27;s attitude towards Christianity was mixed. In his early life, he denounced it for fuelling war and deemed it a hypocritical religion, though he later voiced his admiration for the Catholic Church and attributed the most valuable parts of European civilisation to it. His interest in the Catholic Mass inspired his largest score, the &quot;Messa grande sinfonica&quot;. Although he professed that he was not Catholic, he may have embraced some of the faith in private.

== Music ==
=== Early works ===

Although there has been speculation about earlier works, Sorabji&#x27;s first known (albeit lost) composition is a 1914 piano transcription of Delius&#x27;s orchestral piece &quot;In a Summer Garden&quot;. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are the most ambitious and developed. They are characterised mainly by their use of the single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism against them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, described them as derivative and lacking in cohesion, and even considered destroying many of their manuscripts late in his life.

=== Middle-period works and symphonic style ===

The &quot;Three Pastiches for Piano&quot; (1922) and &quot;Le jardin parfumé&quot; (1923) have often been seen as the beginning of Sorabji&#x27;s compositional maturity. Sorabji himself considered that it began with his Organ Symphony No. 1 (1924), his first work to make ample use of forms like the chorale prelude, the passacaglia and the fugue, which are descended from baroque music. Their union with his earlier compositional ideas led to the emergence of what has been described as his &quot;symphonic style&quot;, displayed in most of his seven symphonies for piano solo and three symphonies for organ. The first piece to apply the architectural blueprint of this style is his Fourth Piano Sonata (1928–29), which is in three sections:
* An opening polythematic movement;
* An ornamental slow movement (labelled as a nocturne);
* A multi-sectional finale, which includes a fugue.

Sorabji&#x27;s symphonic first movements are related in their organisation to his Second and Third Piano Sonatas and the closing movement of his First Organ Symphony. They have been described as being based superficially on either the fugue or the sonata-allegro form, but they differ from the normal application of those forms: the exposition and development of themes are not guided by conventional tonal principles, but by how the themes, as the musicologist Simon John Abrahams says, &quot;battle with each other for domination of the texture&quot;. These movements can last over 90 minutes, and their thematic nature varies considerably: while the opening movement of his Fourth Piano Sonata introduces seven themes, his Second Piano Symphony&#x27;s has sixty-nine. There is still a &quot;dominant theme&quot; or &quot;motto&quot; in these polythematic movements that is given primary significance and permeates the rest of the composition.
The nocturnes are generally considered to be among Sorabji&#x27;s most accessible works, and they are also some of his most highly regarded; they have been described by Habermann as &quot;the most successful and beautiful of [his] compositions&quot;, and by the pianist Fredrik Ullén as &quot;perhaps ... his most personal and original contribution as a composer&quot;. Sorabji&#x27;s descriptions of his Symphony No. 2, &quot;Jāmī&quot;, give an insight into their organisation. He compared the piece to his nocturne &quot;Gulistān&quot; and wrote of the symphony&#x27;s &quot;self-cohesive texture relying upon its own inner consistency and cohesiveness without relation to thematic or other matters&quot;. Melodic material is treated loosely in such works; instead of themes, ornamentation and textural patterns assume a preeminent position. The nocturnes explore free, impressionist harmonies and are usually to be played at subdued dynamic levels, though some of the later ones contain explosive passagework. They can be stand-alone works, such as &quot;Villa Tasca&quot;, or parts of larger pieces, like &quot;Anāhata Cakra&quot;, the fourth movement of his &quot;Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone&quot;. Sections titled &quot;aria&quot; and &quot;punta d&#x27;organo&quot; (the latter of which have been likened to &quot;Le gibet&quot; from Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot;) are included in this genre.

Sorabji&#x27;s fugues usually follow traditional methods of development and are the most atonal and least polyrhythmic of his works. After an exposition introduces a subject and one to four countersubjects, the thematic material undergoes development. It is followed by a stretto that leads to a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. If a fugue has multiple themes, this pattern is repeated for each subject and material from all expositions is combined near the end. Sorabji&#x27;s fugal writing has at times been treated with suspicion or criticised. The subjects can lack the frequent changes of direction present in most melodic writing, and some of the fugues are among the longest ever penned, one being the two-hour &quot;Fuga triplex&quot; that closes the Second Symphony for Organ.

This structural layout was employed and refined in most of Sorabji&#x27;s piano and organ symphonies. In some cases, a variation set takes the place of the slow movement. Starting with the Second Symphony for Piano (1954), fugues are positioned either midway through the work or right before a closing slow movement. and &quot;moto perpetuo&quot;-type sections link larger movements together and make appearances in Sorabji&#x27;s later fugues, like in the Sixth Symphony for Piano (1975–76), whose &quot;Quasi fuga&quot; alternates fugal and non-fugal sections.

Other important forms in Sorabji&#x27;s output are the toccata and the autonomous variation set. The latter, along with his non-orchestral symphonies, are his most ambitious works and have been praised for the imagination exhibited in them. &quot;Sequentia cyclica super &quot;Dies irae&quot; ex Missa pro defunctis&quot; (1948–49), a set of 27 variations on the original &quot;Dies irae&quot; plainchant, is considered by some to be his greatest work. His four multi-movement toccatas are generally more modest in scope and take the structure of Busoni&#x27;s work of the same name as their starting point.

=== Late works ===

In 1953, Sorabji expressed uninterest in continuing to compose when he described &quot;Sequentia cyclica&quot; (1948–49) as &quot;the climax and crown of his work for the piano and, in all probability, the last he will write&quot;. His rate of composition slowed down in the early 1960s, and later that decade, Sorabji vowed to cease composing, which he eventually did in 1968.

Hinton played a crucial role in Sorabji&#x27;s return to composition. Sorabji&#x27;s next two pieces, &quot;Benedizione di San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi&quot; and &quot;Symphonia brevis for Piano&quot;, were written in 1973, the year after the two first met, and marked the beginning of what has been identified as his &quot;late style&quot;, one characterised by thinner textures and greater use of extended harmonies. Roberge writes that Sorabji, upon completing the first movement of &quot;Symphonia brevis&quot;, &quot;felt that it broke new ground for him and was his most mature work, one in which he was doing things he had never done before&quot;. Sorabji said his late works were designed &quot;as a &quot;seamless coat&quot; ... from which the threads cannot be disassociated&quot; without compromising the coherence of the music. During his late period and several years before his creative hiatus, he also produced sets of &quot;aphoristic fragments&quot;, musical utterances that can last just a few seconds.

=== Inspiration and influences ===
Sorabji&#x27;s early influences include Cyril Scott, Ravel, Leo Ornstein and particularly Alexander Scriabin. He later became more critical of Scriabin and, after meeting Busoni in 1919, was influenced primarily by the latter in both his music and writings. His later work was also significantly influenced by the virtuoso writing of Charles-Valentin Alkan and Leopold Godowsky, Max Reger&#x27;s use of counterpoint, and the impressionist harmonies of Claude Debussy and Karol Szymanowski. Allusions to various composers appear in Sorabji&#x27;s works, including his Sixth Symphony for Piano and &quot;Sequentia cyclica&quot;, which contain sections titled &quot;Quasi Alkan&quot; and &quot;Quasi Debussy&quot; respectively.
Eastern culture partially influenced Sorabji. According to Habermann, it manifests itself in the following ways: highly supple and irregular rhythmic patterns, abundant ornamentation, an improvisatory and timeless feel, frequent polyrhythmic writing and the vast dimensions of some of his compositions. Sorabji wrote in 1960 that he almost never sought to blend Eastern and Western music, and although he had positive things to say about Indian music in the 1920s, he later criticised what he saw as limitations inherent in it and the raga, including a lack of thematic development, which was sidelined in favour of repetition. A major source of inspiration were his readings of Persian literature, especially for his nocturnes, which have been described by Sorabji and others as evoking tropical heat, a hothouse or a rainforest.

Various religious and occult references appear in Sorabji&#x27;s music, including allusions to the tarot, a setting of a Catholic benediction and sections named after the seven deadly sins. Sorabji rarely intended for his works to be programmatic; although pieces like &quot;Quaere reliqua hujus materiei inter secretiora&quot; and &quot;St. Bertrand de Comminges: &quot;He was laughing in the tower&quot;&quot; (both inspired by ghost stories by M. R. James) have been described as such, he repeatedly heaped scorn on attempts to represent stories or ideologies in music.

Sorabji&#x27;s interest in numerology can be seen in his allotting of a number to the length of his scores, the amount of variations a piece contains or the number of bars in a work. Recent scholarly writings on Sorabji&#x27;s music have suggested an interest in the golden section as a means of formal division. Squares, repdigits and other numbers with special symbolism are common. Page numbers may be used twice or absent to achieve the desired result; for example, the last page of Sorabji&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 5 is numbered 343a, although the score has 336 pages. This type of alteration is also seen in his numbering of variations.

Sorabji, who claimed to be of Spanish-Sicilian ancestry, composed pieces that reflect an enthusiasm for Southern European cultures, such as &quot;Fantasia ispanica&quot;, &quot;Rosario d&#x27;arabeschi&quot; and &quot;Passeggiata veneziana&quot;. These are works of a Mediterranean character and are inspired by Busoni&#x27;s Elegy No. 2, &quot;All&#x27;Italia! in modo napolitano&quot;, and the Spanish music of Isaac Albéniz, Debussy, Enrique Granados and Franz Liszt. They are considered to be among his outwardly more virtuosic and musically less ambitious works. French culture and art also appealed to Sorabji, and he set French texts to music. Around 60 per cent of his known works have titles in Latin, Italian and other foreign languages.

=== Harmony, counterpoint and form ===
Sorabji&#x27;s counterpoint stems from Busoni and Reger, as did his reliance on theme-oriented baroque forms. His use of these often contrasts with the more rhapsodic, improvisatory writing of his fantasias and nocturnes, which, because of their non-thematic nature, have been called &quot;static&quot;. Abrahams describes Sorabji&#x27;s approach as built on &quot;self-organising&quot; (baroque) and athematic forms that can be expanded as needed, as their ebb and flow is not dictated by themes. While Sorabji wrote pieces of standard or even minute dimensions, his largest works (for which he is perhaps best known) call for skills and stamina beyond the reach of most performers; examples include his Piano Sonata No. 5 (&quot;Opus archimagicum&quot;), &quot;Sequentia cyclica&quot; and the &quot;Symphonic Variations for Piano&quot;, which last about six, eight and nine hours respectively. Roberge estimates that Sorabji&#x27;s extant musical output, which he describes as &quot;[perhaps] the most extensive of any twentieth-century composer&quot;, may occupy up to 160 hours in performance.

Sorabji&#x27;s harmonic language often combines tonal and atonal elements, frequently uses triadic harmonies and bitonal combinations, and it does not avoid tonal references. It also reflects his fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. Despite the use of harmonies traditionally considered harsh, it has been remarked that his writing rarely contains the tension that is associated with very dissonant music. Sorabji achieved this in part by using widely spaced chords rooted in triadic harmonies and pedal points in the low registers, which act as sound cushions and soften dissonances in the upper voices. In bitonal passages, melodies may be consonant within a harmonic area, but not with those from the other one. Sorabji uses non-functional harmony, in which no key or bitonal relationship is allowed to become established. This lends flexibility to his harmonic language and helps justify the superimposition of semitonally opposed harmonies.

=== Creative process and notation ===
Because of Sorabji&#x27;s sense of privacy, little is known about his compositional process. According to early accounts by Warlock, he composed and did not revise his work. This claim is generally regarded as dubious and contradicts statements made by Sorabji himself (as well as some of his musical manuscripts). In the 1950s, Sorabji stated that he would conceive the general outline of a work in advance and long before the thematic material. A few sketches survive; crossed-out passages are mostly found in his early works. Some have claimed that Sorabji used yoga to gather &quot;creative energies&quot;, when in fact it helped him regulate his thoughts and achieve self-discipline. He found composition enervating and often completed works with headaches and experiencing sleepless nights afterwards.

The unusual features of Sorabji&#x27;s music and the &quot;ban&quot; resulted in idiosyncrasies in his notation: a shortage of interpretative directions, the relative absence of time signatures (except in his chamber and orchestral works) and the non-systematic use of bar lines. He wrote extremely quickly, and there are many ambiguities in his musical autographs, which has prompted comparisons with his other characteristics. Hinton suggested a link between them and Sorabji&#x27;s speech, and said that &quot;[Sorabji] invariably spoke at a speed almost too great for intelligibility&quot;, while Stevenson remarked, &quot;One sentence could embrace two or three languages.&quot; Sorabji&#x27;s handwriting, particularly after he began to suffer from rheumatism, can be difficult to decipher. After complaining about errors in one of his open letters, the editor of the journal responded, &quot;If Mr. Sorabji will in future send his letters in typescript instead of barely decipherable handwriting, we will promise a freedom from misprints&quot;. In later life, similar issues came to affect his typewriting.

=== Pianism and keyboard music ===

==== As a performer ====
Sorabji&#x27;s pianistic abilities have been the subject of much contention. After his early lessons, he appeared to have been self-taught. In the 1920s and 1930s, when he was performing his works in public, their alleged unplayability and his piano technique generated considerable controversy. At the same time, his closest friends and a few other people hailed him as a first-class performer. Roberge says that he was &quot;far from a polished virtuoso in the usual sense&quot;, a view shared by other writers.

Sorabji was a reluctant performer and struggled with the pressure of playing in public. On various occasions, he stated that he was not a pianist, and he always prioritised composition; from 1939, he no longer practised the piano often. Contemporary reviews noted Sorabji&#x27;s tendency to rush the music and his lack of patience with quiet passages, and the private recordings that he made in the 1960s contain substantial deviations from his scores, attributed in part to his impatience and uninterest in playing clearly and accurately. Writers have thus argued that early reactions to his music were significantly coloured by flaws in his performances.

==== As a composer ====

Many of Sorabji&#x27;s works are written for the piano or have an important piano part. His writing for the instrument was influenced by composers such as Liszt and Busoni, and he has been called a composer-pianist in their tradition. Godowsky&#x27;s polyphony, polyrhythms and polydynamics were particularly influential and led to the regular use of the sostenuto pedal and systems of three or more staves in Sorabji&#x27;s keyboard parts; his largest such system appears on page 124 of his Third Organ Symphony and consists of 11 staves. In some works, Sorabji writes for the extra keys available on the Imperial Bösendorfer. While its extended keyboard includes only additional low notes, at times he called for extra notes at its upper end.

Sorabji&#x27;s piano writing has been praised by some for its variety and understanding of the piano&#x27;s sonorities. His approach to the piano was non-percussive, and he emphasised that his music is conceived vocally. He once described &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot; as &quot;a colossal song&quot;, and the pianist Geoffrey Douglas Madge compared Sorabji&#x27;s playing to &quot;bel canto&quot; singing. Sorabji once said, &quot;If a composer can&#x27;t sing, a composer can&#x27;t compose.&quot;

Some of Sorabji&#x27;s piano pieces strive to emulate the sounds of other instruments, as seen in score markings such as &quot;quasi organo pieno&quot; (like a full organ), &quot;pizzicato&quot; and &quot;quasi tuba con sordino&quot; (like a tuba with mute). In this respect, Alkan was a key source of inspiration: Sorabji was influenced by his Symphony for Solo Piano and the &quot;Concerto pour piano seul&quot;, and he admired Alkan&#x27;s &quot;orchestral&quot; writing for the instrument.

==== Organ music ====
Besides the piano, the other keyboard instrument to occupy a prominent position in Sorabji&#x27;s output is the organ. Sorabji&#x27;s largest orchestral works have organ parts, but his most important contribution to the instrument&#x27;s repertoire are his three organ symphonies (1924; 1929–32; 1949–53), all of which are large-scale tripartite works that consist of multiple subsections and last up to nine hours. Organ Symphony No. 1 was regarded by Sorabji as his first mature work and he numbered the Third Organ Symphony among his finest achievements. He considered even the best orchestras of the day to be inferior to the modern organ and wrote of the &quot;tonal splendour, grandeur and magnificence&quot; of the instruments in Liverpool Cathedral and the Royal Albert Hall. Organists were described by him as being more cultured and having sounder musical judgement than most musicians.

==== Creative transcription ====
Transcription was a creative endeavour for Sorabji, as it had been for many of the composer-pianists who inspired him: Sorabji echoed Busoni&#x27;s view that composition is the transcription of an abstract idea, as is performance. For Sorabji, transcription enabled older material to undergo transformation to create an entirely new work (which he did in his pastiches), and he saw the practice as a way to enrich and uncover the ideas concealed in a piece. His transcriptions include an adaptation of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Chromatic Fantasia&quot;, in the preface to which he denounced those who perform Bach on the piano without &quot;any substitution in pianistic terms&quot;. Sorabji praised performers like Egon Petri and Wanda Landowska for taking liberties in performance and for their perceived ability to understand a composer&#x27;s intentions, including his own.

== Writings ==
As a writer, Sorabji is best known for his music criticism. He contributed to publications that dealt with music in England, including &quot;The New Age&quot;, &quot;The New English Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Musical Times&quot; and &quot;Musical Opinion&quot;. His writings also cover non-musical issues: he criticised British rule in India and supported birth control and legalised abortion. As a homosexual in a time when male same-sex acts were illegal in England (and remained so until 1967), he wrote about the biological and social realities that homosexuals faced for much of his lifetime. He first published an article on the subject in 1921, in response to a legislative change that would penalise &quot;gross indecency&quot; between women. The article referenced research showing that homosexuality was inborn and could not be cured by imprisonment. It further called for the law to catch up with the latest medical findings, and advocated for decriminalising homosexual behaviour. Sorabji&#x27;s later writings on sexual topics include contributions to &quot;The Occult Review&quot; and the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;, and in 1958, he joined the Homosexual Law Reform Society.

=== Books and music criticism ===

Sorabji first expressed interest in becoming a music critic in 1914, and he started contributing criticism to &quot;The New Age&quot; in 1924 after the magazine had published some of his letters to the editor. By 1930, Sorabji became disillusioned with concert life and developed a growing interest in gramophone recordings, believing that he would eventually lose all reason to attend concerts. In 1945, he stopped providing regular reviews and only occasionally submitted his writings to correspondence columns in journals. While his earlier writings reflect a contempt for the music world in general—from its businessmen to its performers—his later reviews tend to be more detailed and less caustic.

Although in his youth Sorabji was attracted to the progressive currents of 1910s&#x27; European art music, his musical tastes were essentially conservative. He had a particular affinity for late-Romantic and Impressionist composers, such as Debussy, Medtner and Szymanowski, and he admired composers of large-scale, contrapuntally elaborate works, including Bach, Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner and Reger. He also had much respect for composer-pianists like Liszt, Alkan and Busoni. Sorabji&#x27;s main &quot;&quot; were Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg (from the late 1920s onwards), Paul Hindemith and, in general, composers who emphasised percussive rhythm. He rejected serialism and twelve-tone composition, as he considered both to be based on artificial precepts, denounced Schoenberg&#x27;s vocal writing and use of &quot;Sprechgesang&quot;, and even criticised his later tonal works and transcriptions. He loathed the rhythmic character of Stravinsky&#x27;s music and what he perceived as its brutality and lack of melodic qualities. He viewed Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassicism as a sign of a lack of imagination. Sorabji was also dismissive of the symmetry and architectural approaches used by Mozart and Brahms, and believed that the Classical style restricted musical material by forcing it into a &quot;ready-made mould&quot;. Gabriel Fauré and Dmitri Shostakovich are among the composers whom Sorabji initially condemned but later admired.
Sorabji&#x27;s best-known writings are the books &quot;Around Music&quot; (1932; reissued 1979) and &quot;Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician&quot; (1947; reissued 1986); both include revised versions of some of his essays and received mostly positive reviews, though Sorabji considered the latter book much better. Readers commended his courage, expertise and intellectual incisiveness, but some felt that his verbose style and use of invectives and vitriol detracted from the solid foundation underlying the writings. These remarks echo general criticisms of his prose, which has been called turgid and in which intelligibility is compromised by very long sentences and missing commas. In recent times, his writings have been highly divisive, being viewed by some as profoundly perceptive and enlightening, and by others as misguided, but the literature on them remains limited. Abrahams mentions that Sorabji&#x27;s music criticism was restricted largely to one readership and says that much of it, including &quot;Around Music&quot; and &quot;Mi contra fa&quot;, has yet to receive a major critique.

Roberge writes that Sorabji &quot;could sing the praises of some modern British personalities without end, especially when he knew them, or he could tear their music to pieces with very harsh and thoughtless comments that would nowadays lay him open to ridicule&quot;; he adds that &quot;his biting comments also often brought him to the edge of libel&quot;. Sorabji championed a number of composers and his advocacy helped many of them move closer to the mainstream at a time when they were largely unknown or misunderstood. In some cases, he was recognised for promoting their music: he became one of the honorary vice-presidents of the Alkan Society in 1979, and in 1982, the Polish government awarded him a medal for championing Szymanowski&#x27;s work.

== Legacy ==

=== Reception ===
Sorabji&#x27;s music and personality have inspired both praise and condemnation, the latter of which has been often attributed to the length of some of his works. Hugh MacDiarmid ranked him as one of the four greatest minds Great Britain had produced in his lifetime, eclipsed only by T. S. Eliot, and the composer and conductor Mervyn Vicars put Sorabji next to Richard Wagner, who he believed &quot;had one of the finest brains since Da Vinci&quot;. By contrast, several major books on music history, including Richard Taruskin&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Oxford History of Western Music&quot;, do not mention Sorabji, and he has never received official recognition from his country of birth. A 1994 review of &quot;Le jardin parfumé&quot; (1923) suggested that &quot;the unsympathetic might say that besides not belonging in our time it equally belongs in no other place&quot;, and in 1937, one critic wrote that &quot;one could listen to many more performances without really understanding the unique complexity of Sorabji&#x27;s mind and music&quot;.

In recent times, this divided reception has persisted to an extent. While some compare Sorabji to composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and Messiaen, others dismiss him altogether. The pianist and composer Jonathan Powell writes of Sorabji&#x27;s &quot;unusual ability to combine the disparate and create surprising coherence&quot;. Abrahams finds that Sorabji&#x27;s musical production exhibits enormous &quot;variety and imagination&quot; and calls him &quot;one of the few composers of the time to be able to develop a unique personal style &quot;and&quot; employ it freely at any scale he chose&quot;. The organist Kevin Bowyer counts Sorabji&#x27;s organ works, together with those of Messiaen, among the &quot;Twentieth-Century Works of Genius&quot;. Others have expressed more negative sentiments. The music critic Andrew Clements calls Sorabji &quot;just another 20th-century English eccentric ... whose talent never matched [his] musical ambition&quot;. The pianist John Bell Young described Sorabji&#x27;s music as &quot;glib repertoire&quot; for &quot;glib&quot; performers. The musicologist and critic Max Harrison, in his review of Rapoport&#x27;s book &quot;Sorabji: A Critical Celebration&quot;, wrote unfavourably about Sorabji&#x27;s compositions, piano playing, writings and personal conduct and implied that &quot;nobody cared except a few close friends&quot;. Another assessment was offered by the music critic Peter J. Rabinowitz, who, reviewing the 2015 reissue of Habermann&#x27;s early Sorabji recordings, wrote that they &quot;may provide a clue about why—even with the advocacy of some of the most ferociously talented pianists of the age—Sorabji&#x27;s music has remained arcane&quot;. While saying that &quot;it&#x27;s hard not to be captivated, even hypnotized, by the sheer luxury of [his] nocturnes&quot; and praising the &quot;angular, dramatic, electrically crackling gestures&quot; of some of his works, he claims that their tendency to &quot;ostentatiously avoid the traditional Western rhetoric ... that marks out beginning, middle, and end or that sets up strong patterns of expectation and resolution&quot; makes them hard to approach.

Roberge says that Sorabji &quot;failed to realize ... that negative criticism is part of the game, and that people who can be sympathetic to one&#x27;s music do exist, though they may sometimes be hard to find&quot;, and Sorabji&#x27;s lack of interaction with the music world has been criticised even by his admirers. In September 1988, following lengthy conversations with the composer, Hinton founded The Sorabji Archive to disseminate knowledge of Sorabji&#x27;s legacy. His musical autographs are located in various places across the world, with the largest collection of them residing in the (Basel, Switzerland). While much of his music remained in manuscript form until the early 2000s, interest in it has grown since then, with his piano works being the best represented by recordings and modern editions. Landmark events in the discovery of Sorabji&#x27;s music include performances of &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot; by Madge and John Ogdon, and Powell&#x27;s recording of &quot;Sequentia cyclica&quot;. First editions of many of Sorabji&#x27;s piano works have been made by Powell and the pianist Alexander Abercrombie, among others, and the three organ symphonies have been edited by Bowyer.

=== Innovation ===
Sorabji has been described as a conservative composer who developed an idiosyncratic style fusing diverse influences. However, the perception of and responses to his music have evolved over the years. His early, often modernist works were greeted largely with incomprehension: a 1922 review stated, &quot;compared to Mr. Sorabji, Arnold Schönberg must be a tame reactionary&quot;, and the composer Louis Saguer, speaking at Darmstadt in 1949, mentioned Sorabji as a member of the musical avant-garde that few will have the means to understand. Abrahams writes that Sorabji &quot;had begun his compositional career at the forefront of compositional thought and ended it seeming decidedly old-fashioned&quot;, yet adds that &quot;even now Sorabji&#x27;s &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27; outlook sometimes remains somewhat cryptic&quot;.

Various parallels have been identified between Sorabji and later composers. Ullén suggests that Sorabji&#x27;s &quot;100 Transcendental Studies&quot; (1940–1944) can be seen as presaging the piano music of Ligeti, Michael Finnissy and Brian Ferneyhough, although he cautions against overstating this. Roberge compares the opening of Sorabji&#x27;s orchestral piece &quot;Chaleur—Poème&quot; (1916–17) to the micropolyphonic texture of Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;Atmosphères&quot; (1961) and Powell has noted the use of metric modulation in &quot;Sequentia cyclica&quot; (1948–49), which was composed around the same time as (and independently from) Elliott Carter&#x27;s 1948 Cello Sonata, the first work in which Carter employed the technique. The mixing of chords with different root notes and the use of nested tuplets, both present throughout Sorabji&#x27;s works, have been described as anticipating Messiaen&#x27;s music and Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Klavierstücke&quot; (1952–2004) respectively by several decades. Sorabji&#x27;s fusion of tonality and atonality into a new approach to relationships between harmonies, too, has been called an important innovation.

<text>Angra do Heroísmo (), or simply Angra, is a city and municipality on Terceira Island, Portugal, and one of the three capital cities of the Azores. Founded in 1478, Angra was historically the most important city in the Azores, as seat of the Bishop of the Azores, government entities, and having previously served as the capital city of Portugal during the Liberal Wars. The population in 2011 was 35,402, in an area of 239.00 km2. It was classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1983.

==Name==
Angra is the Portuguese word for &quot;inlet&quot;, &quot;cove&quot;, or &quot;bay&quot;. The epithet &quot;&quot; (&quot;of Heroism&quot;, &quot;the Heroic&quot;) was granted to the city by Maria II to commemorate its citizens&#x27; successful defense of the island against a Miguelist assault in 1829.

==History==

Some claim that Angra was founded by Álvaro Martins, who sailed with Didrik Pining on his expedition to the New World, and with Bartolomeu Dias on his voyage around the Cape of Good Hope. Others contend that Angra was founded in 1450 or 1451 by Jácome de Bruges, a Fleming in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator, who recruited farmers, fishermen, and merchants in the Low Countries to colonize the Azores.

The first references to the settlement of the Azores date to between 1439 and 1449, through the donation of Henry the Navigator the colonization of seven islands in the central and eastern groups of the archipelago. Terceira, included in this group, would be administered by Jácome de Bruges as stipulated in the nomination process, dated March 1450, that included not only the settlement of the lands, but also the milling monopoly, ovens, salt concession, land rights in the name of the monarchy, tithes, administration of justice, and rights of succession including the exceptional provision for materlineal succession. But, the great difficulty in attracting settlers meant that by 22 August 1460, the island was still unpopulated.

The site chosen by the first settlers was a ridgeline, which opened, like an amphitheatre, onto two small bays, separated by a peninsula, at the head of which stood the extinct volcano of Monte Brasil. One of these coves was deep enough (around ) to provide an anchorage for large vessels, and it had the further advantage of being sheltered from most strong winds, except for those from the south and southeast.

In 1474, Álvaro Martins Homem ordered that the river flowing into the cove be diverted into a manmade stone-lined channel, running downhill, so that its rushing waters could be harnessed to turn the waterwheel of a mill. This laid the foundation for the future economic development of the village of Angra. At the same time, this allowed the area on either side of the river&#x27;s course to be rearranged according to a rectilinear street-plan and organized into neighborhoods by function (commercial, residential, etc.), to accommodate the needs of the fast-growing port. The first houses of Angra were built on the hillside above the cove, the steep streets winding down to the shore. On high ground, away from the sea, a castle/stronghold/fortress was begun; it would eventually be named &quot;Castelo dos Moinhos&quot; (). By 1534, Angra was the first town in the archipelago to be elevated to the status of &quot;city&quot;. In the same year, it was chosen by Pope Paul III to be the seat of the Diocese of Angra, with ecclesiastical authority over all of the islands of the Azores.

The commercial port of early Angra played an important role in the Portuguese East Indies trade beginning in the 15th century. The bay of Angra was often full of caravels and galleons, a circumstance that contributed to the progress of the city and its people. The construction of a number of manors, convents, churches, and military fortifications in Angra, infrastructures that were usually inappropriate for a small city (or small island) indicates the important role that Angra played in trans-Atlantic shipping for the Portuguese. The Portuguese nobleman Pero Anes do Canto (1480–1556), who was born at Guimarães, was the superintendent of fortifications on Terceira. For his competency in that role, and other services to the Portuguese Crown, he was rewarded with the title &quot;moço fidalgo&quot; (knight-gentleman), and the high office of &quot;Purveyor to the Armada of the Islands and the merchant vessels of the East India trade in all of the islands of the Azores&quot; (a hereditary title that followed successive members of the Canto family for three hundred years). The importance and power of the Cantos can hardly be overstated. During the period when Portugal was trading with its Asian, African, and South American colonies, they were responsible for the protection and welfare of the merchant fleet (and the staggering wealth represented by the cargoes in their holds) once the ships approached the last leg of their voyages in the North Atlantic. They were also responsible for acting as the chief customs official, the chief magistrate charged with resolving disputes, and the overseer of the naval defenses of the Azores.

===Portuguese succession===
Before Philip II of Spain had a chance to enforce his claim to the crown of Portugal, in 1580, António, Prior of Crato, an illegitimate scion of the Beja line of the House of Braganza Portuguese royal family, proclaimed himself king on 24 July 1580. However, his rule in continental Portugal lasted only twenty days; on 25 August, he was defeated at the Battle of Alcântara by the Spanish Habsburg armies led by Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba.

After Alcântara, he attempted to rule Portugal from the Azores, where he established an opposition government in Angra do Heroísmo that lasted until 1583. Although for a time he was the monarch (minting coin and conferring titles), his government on Terceira was only recognized in the Azores, and from that place of refuge, António conducted a popular resistance movement opposed to the recognition of a foreign king. He was supported by a number of French adventurers under Filippo di Piero Strozzi, a Florentine exile in the service of France, as well as Portuguese patriots, some of whom came to the Azores to assist him directly.

;Battle of Salga Bay
The first military action in the Azores occurred about a year after António&#x27;s crushing defeat at Alcântara. A Spanish fleet of ten warships, commanded by Pedro Valdez, bombarded Angra on 5 July 1581, then began investigating the coast of the island in search of the best landing places. At dawn on 25 July, the first ships loaded with Spanish troops anchored in Salga Bay, about twelve kilometres east of Angra&#x27;s harbour in the village of Vila de São Sebastião. A coastwatcher, stationed at the cape called Ponta do Coelho, gave the alarm, but when the first Portuguese forces arrived about one thousand Castilians had already landed and had started to sack the surrounding villages. In this phase of the fighting, according to local accounts of the action, a leading role was played by young and pretty Brianda Pereira who, together with other women, attacked the enemy with farm implements when she saw her house destroyed.

By midmorning, the Spaniards were sweeping the coast with their artillery, and the fighting was fierce. About midday, when the outcome of the battle was still unsettled, an Augustinian friar called Pedro, who was taking an active part in the struggle, thought of the stratagem of driving cattle against the Spaniards so as to scatter them. Over a thousand head of cattle were quickly gathered and, by means of shouts and musket shots, driven against the enemy positions. The disconcerted Spaniards fell back and were pursued to the shore, where almost all of them lost their lives in the fighting or drowned while trying to reach their boats. This unconventional victory, the Battle of Salga Bay, proved that António could count on a good deal of local support.

;Battle of Ponta Delgada
The next major military action did not take place until the following summer. Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz, was sent in 1582, as &quot;Admiral of the Ocean&quot;, to drive the pretender and his supporters from Angra and the Azores. Badly outnumbered, he won the Battle of Ponta Delgada on 26 July 1582, off the coast of the island of São Miguel, against a loose confederation of Portuguese, French, English, and Dutch privateers.

;Battle of Terceira
Although António&#x27;s fleet was completely defeated at the Battle of Ponta Delgada, the pretender did flee into exile in France after the battle. His supporters were subsequently defeated the following year at the Battle of Terceira, near Angra, on 27 July 1583, which allowed Philip&#x27;s forces to finally occupy the Azores and complete his unification of the Crowns of Spain and Portugal. Yet, Santa Cruz, the Spanish admiral, who was acclaimed for his victories against the House of Aviz and its partisans in the Azores, recognized that England presented a grave threat to Spain&#x27;s empire, and he became a zealous advocate of war with the English. A letter he wrote to Philip II from Angra do Heroísmo, on 9 August 1583, two weeks after the Battle of Terceira, contains the first definite suggestion of the formation of the Spanish Armada.

It was following the events of the battle of Terceira that the existing fortifications in Monte Brasil were rethought. During the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), the original Portuguese fortifications were redesigned by Italian military engineer Giovanni Vicenzo Casale and his assistants, since privateers, such as Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh, had attacked Spanish ships and possessions. The first cornerstone was laid in 1583, and the fortifications were progressively elaborated to include several bastions and cannon emplacements. By the Restoration, the Spanish commander, Álvaro de Viveiros, resisted for eleven months (from 27 March 1641 to 4 March 1642) behind the walls of the impregnable fortress, and only a concentrated task force commanded by Francisco Ornelas da Câmara and João de Bettencourt were able to defeat the commander. The fort was taken, and reclaimed for Portugal: a church was constructed within the fortress in honour of Saint John the Baptist () after 1642.

===17th century===
Over the years, Terceira (and Angra in particular) has been a popular place for out-of-favor monarchs to cool their heels while events on the Portuguese mainland or elsewhere went on without them. In 1667, near the end of the Portuguese Restoration War, King Afonso VI, his chief advisor, Castelo Melhor, and Castelo Melhor&#x27;s francophile party were overthrown by the king&#x27;s younger brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja, (who later ruled as Pedro II of Portugal.) Pedro first installed himself as his brother&#x27;s regent; then, he arranged Afonso&#x27;s exile to the island of Terceira in the Azores on the pretense that he was incapable of governing. Afonso&#x27;s exile lasted seven years.

João Baptista da Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett, better known as the author Almeida Garrett, was born in 1799 in Porto, Portugal. In 1809, his family fled the second French invasion carried out by Soult&#x27;s troops, seeking refuge in Angra do Heroísmo. While in the Azores, he was taught by his uncles, all prominent churchmen. (His uncle, Dom Frei Alexandre da Sagrada Família, was the twenty-fifth bishop of Angra.) In 1818, Almeida Garrett left the island and moved to Coimbra to study at the university&#x27;s law school.

===19th century===
When King João VI died in 1826, the country was plunged into a succession crisis. The king had a rightful male heir, Emperor Pedro of Brazil, who had successfully rebelled against his father in the 1820s. Many prominent Portuguese, however, did not wish to be reunified with their former colony. The king&#x27;s younger son Miguel was exiled in Austria, having led a number of failed revolutions of his own against his father&#x27;s liberal regime. Pedro abdicated the Portuguese throne in favor of his 7-year-old daughter Maria da Glória, stipulating that she would marry her uncle Miguel when she came of age. In order to rule jointly with his niece, however, Miguel was obligated to swear an oath to uphold the existing liberal constitution. Miguel initially agreed but quickly reneged. He deposed his young niece and began establishing an absolutist monarchy.

Pedro and his daughter then began a conflict known variously as the Liberal Wars, the Portuguese Civil War, the War of the Two Brothers, and the Miguelite War. On June 22, 1828, liberals deposed the Azores&#x27; captain-general Manuel Vieira de Albuquerque Touvar, deporting him to the mainland and establishing a headquarters on Terceira. The Battle of Praia da Vitória on August 11, 1829, saw the Terceirans repulse a Miguelist attack. This would lead to Angra being given the honorary title of &quot;&quot;, &quot;the Heroic&quot;. Maria da Glória resided on the island from 1830 to 1833; her forces were victorious the following year.

On 20 September 1836, Charles Darwin, the eminent English naturalist, nearing the end of his voyage around the world aboard the research vessel HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;, arrived at the Azores and anchored at Angra. The next day, Darwin hired a horse and some guides and rode to the center of the island where an active volcanic crater was supposed to exist. What he found there was not a &quot;crater&quot; at all; instead, what he found was a series of fissures in the rock with steam issuing from them. To a naturalist, his long day in the saddle was not very illuminating. Biologically speaking, Darwin wrote, he could &quot;find nothing of interest&quot;. The next day, Darwin traveled along the coast road and visited the town of Praia da Vitória on the northeastern end of the island. He returned by way of the northern shore, and he crossed the central part of the island on his way back to the &quot;Beagle&quot;. He departed on 25 September for the island of São Miguel, to pick up any letters that may have been posted to him there.

Angra and neighboring Praia da Vitória were the sites of an interesting episode of the American Civil War. Unable to break the blockade by US Navy ships of southern (Confederate) ports, and hoping to draw these blockading ships away to counter other perceived threats, the Confederate States of America had commerce raiders built in Britain and France. One of these left Liverpool in July 1862 in the guise of a &quot;merchant ship&quot; and rendezvoused with supporting ships in the harbor of Praia da Vitória. This meeting-place was chosen because Portugal was neutral and the Azores were far away from pursuing US Navy ships. In that port and, later at Angra, cannon and other supplies of war were transferred aboard the new ship. The &quot;CSS Alabama&quot; was commissioned on 24 August 1862 just outside the harbor of Angra, and it left Terceira to begin its career as the most effective commerce raider in naval history.

Ngungunhane (also known as Mdungazwe Ngungunyane Nxumalo, N&#x27;gungunhana, or Gungunhana Reinaldo Frederico Gungunhana) was born in Gaza in southern Africa around 1850, and he died at Angra do Heroísmo on 23 December 1906. A vassal of the Portuguese king, he later rebelled, and he was defeated and imprisoned by the Portuguese Army, led by Joaquim Mouzinho de Albuquerque. He was exiled to Lisbon and then to the island of Terceira, where he converted to Catholicism; he lived there until his death. He was the last emperor of the Empire of Gaza, a territory that is now part of Mozambique, and he was the last monarch of his dynasty.

Nicknamed the &quot;Lion of Gaza&quot;, he reigned from 1884 to 28 December 1895, the day he was made prisoner by Joaquim Mouzinho de Albuquerque in the fortified village of Chaimite. Because he was already known to the European press, the Portuguese colonial administration decided to condemn him to exile rather than send him to face a firing squad, as would normally be the case. He was transported to Lisbon, accompanied by a son named Godide and other dignitaries. After a brief stay, he was transferred to Angra do Heroísmo, where he died eleven years later.

===20th century===
Angra was hit by a major earthquake on 1 January 1980 that did considerable damage to the city&#x27;s historic center and to many other locations on the island of Terceira. The Azores have experienced many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions since prehistoric times, but the 1980 event was probably the most serious since the eighteenth century. The damage in the city was repaired and rebuilt within four years. In 1983, the historic center of Angra do Heroísmo was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Geography==


Angra occupies the south coast of Terceira. It is the headquarters of a military command and the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric. Its principal buildings are the Sé Cathedral of Angra do Heroísmo, a military college, an arsenal, and an observatory. The harbor, now of little commercial or strategic importance (but formerly a major commercial and military port), is sheltered on the west and southwest by the promontory of Monte Brasil, but, today, it is less important than the neighboring ports of Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel and Horta on the island of Faial.

The climate of Angra do Heroísmo is borderline Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;) and humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;), with the August daily mean being just above the isotherm and the July rainfall just below the 30 mm isotherm for the oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) regime. It is also tempered by the Gulf Stream and the warm North Atlantic waters surrounding the Azores, with mild winter temperatures. Temperatures above have never been recorded, with summer days reliably staying around to .

===Human geography===
Administratively, the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo is made up of several civil parishes, which were historically parochial entities administered by the Catholic Church. After the expulsion of the religious orders from Portugal, the Portuguese administration adapted these territorial units into secular institutions that became the foundation of local government. In a civil context, a parish (&quot;freguesia&quot; in Portuguese) is simply a subdivision of a municipality (&quot;concelho&quot; or &quot;município&quot;). The nineteen civil parishes of Angra do Heroísmo are:

* Altares
* Cinco Ribeiras
* Doze Ribeiras
* Feteira
* Nossa Senhora da Conceição
* Porto Judeu
* Posto Santo
* Raminho
* Ribeirinha
* Santa Bárbara
* Santa Luzia
* São Bartolomeu de Regatos
* São Bento
* São Mateus da Calheta
* São Pedro
* Sé
* Serreta
* Terra Chã
* Vila de São Sebastião

Thirteen of the parishes have a thousand people or more, and 88.71% of the population live in these larger parishes. About 11.3% of the population live in the remaining six small parishes. The most populated parish is Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Our Lady of Conception), and the least populated is Serreta. The largest parish geographically is Porto Judeu, and the smallest is Santa Luzia.

==Architecture==
===Civic===

The historic centre of Angra, is located along the southern coast, encompassing the medieval city and fortified citadel that forms the volcanic cone of Monte Brasil. Angra is dominated by the &quot;Old Square&quot; (), also known as the &quot;Square of Saints Cosmo and Damian&quot; () or the &quot;Restoration Square&quot; (). It was one of the first Portuguese squares specifically designed as a broad open space, joining two of the old town&#x27;s main arteries. Angra&#x27;s square is a broad and orderly, paved with Portuguese pavement stone (of white limestone and black basalt). Throughout its history, this main square has had various functions: it was a chicken and livestock market on Sundays; during the struggles between the Liberals and the Absolutists (during the Liberal Wars) it was the site of public hangings; and the location where the local running of the bulls began. The well-planned and handsome square in Angra owes its character to the influence of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which resulted in the reconstruction program that influenced many of the towns and villages of Portugal. The &quot;old square&quot; (which reached its ultimate form during the late 18th century) reflects this new thinking and approach to urbanism and transport. After the 19th century (specifically 1879), it served as a central gathering place for concerts by the military band of the 10th Chasseur regiment, whose barracks were in the Fort of São João Baptista.

* Building of the Angra do Heroísmo Savings ();
* Cemetery of Anchors ();
* Customshouse of Angra do Heroísmo (); constructed to support the influx of peoples and commercial resources into the 15th century colonies of the Azores, the long-house-like civil structure was constructed in the 16th century along the &quot;Patio da Alfândega&quot; alongside the primitive wharf and Church of the Misericórida;
* Manor of D. Violante do Canto ();
* Manor of Madre de Deus (), constructed by João de Bettencourt de Vasconcelos who (along with his brother-in-law, Captain-major Francisco Ornelas da Câmara) used this building in 1641 during their blockade of the fortress of São João Baptista, and carved-out trenches around the building in order to defend the site;
* Manor of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios (), a former-residence of the Canto e Castro family, the 16th century manorhouse was constructed from the residential home of by Pero Anes do Canto, who was nominated as the first Provisionor-of-Arms (in 1527). Responsible for supporting the caravels and carracks that transited the Atlantic, the medieval post was centred in the manorhouse and his descendants expanded the group of buildings, including the large chapel, attributed to Pero&#x27;s great-great-grandson;

===Military===
The island of Terceira, dating from the 15th century had always been susceptible to attacks by pirates and privateers, first from Barbary coast pirates, but later by European powers who sought to capture spoils from the ships returning from the Far East. Following the personal union between Spain and Portugal, following the Dynastic Crisis, the need to protect the transit points of the Azores led to construction of several posts and redoubts along the coast of the island. Among the most important were:
* Castle of Moinhos (), known as the &quot;Castle of São Cristóvão&quot;, or &quot;Castle/Fort of São Luís&quot;, is the ruins of a 16th-century fortification overlooking the city of Angra, today surmounted by the &quot;Alto da Memória&quot;, a 19th-century obelisk dedicated to former King Peter IV of Portugal, whose forces defeated the absolute monarchy of his brother Miguel during the Liberal Wars;
* Fort of Cinco Ribeiras
* Fort of Greta
* Fort of Má Ferramenta (), used throughout the 16th to 20th century, the platform served for a time during the Second World War before being abandoned and left to ruin;
* Fort of Negrito (), home to the Azorean Museum of Military History, Negrito was constructed in 1581 (simultaneously with the Fort of Salga) to provide protection from the then imminent Spanish attack caused by the Succession Crisis of 1580.
* Fort of Salga
* Fort of Santa Catarina das Mós
* Fort of Santo António
* Fort of Santo António do Monte Brasil (), the small fort, which was named after António of Portugal extended the defences of the Bay of Angra by crossing-fire with the Fort of São Sebastião, owing to the shorter range of the former;
* Fort of São Benedito do Monte Brasil
* Fort of São Fernando
* Fort of São Francisco
* Fort of São João (), also known as the Fort of Biscoitinhos, was included in the fortification plans of Tommaso Benedetto, but little was done to improve the large redoubt, which was mistakenly confused, at various times, with the Redoubt of Poço and/or Fort of Açougue;
* Fort of São João Baptista (); Angra do Heroísmo is dominated by the cinder cone of Monte Brasil, on which is located the fortress of São João Baptista, originally completed as the &quot;Fort of São Filipe&quot;, during the Philippine dynasty, under the reign of Philip II of Spain. The fortress, which includes a primary bulwark and encircled by line of walls with four hundred pieces of artillery, used to protected shipping that returned from the East Indies (laden with gold and silver). The fortress is dominated by the Church of São João Baptista () and parade grounds, completed at the end of the end of the Iberian union, following the restoration of Portuguese sovereignty in 1640. At that time, the fortress was renamed to correspond with the name of the church.
* Fort of São Sebastião ()At the other end of the Bay of Angra, opposite the &quot;Porto de Pipas&quot; (&quot;Port of Barrels&quot;), is the Fort of São Sebastião, built in the 16th century on the order of King Sebastian. The scope of its cannons were interlocked with the ranges of the cannons on Monte Brasil and three other small forts along the coastline, creating an effective defensive system for the port, which had been a favourite target for pirates. The &quot;Castelo de São Sebastião&quot; has been transformed into a charming hotel, one of the forty-odd &quot;pousadas&quot; (inns in historic buildings) of Portugal; this transformation preserves its original historic character, but the plumbing has been modernized, and some non-visible structural elements have been strengthened.
* Fort of the Zimbreiro
* Fortress of São Mateus da Calheta (), part of a complex of six forts along the southern coast, the &quot;Great Fort&quot; was constructed after French pirates under Pierre Bertrand de Montluc attacked in 1567;
* Fort of the Açougue
* Fort of the Caninas
* Fort of the Cavalas
* Fort of the Church of São Mateus da Calheta
* Fort of the Maré
* Fort of the Terreiro
* Redoubt of Dois Paus
* Redoubt of Três Paus
* Redoubt of Salga

===Religious===
At one stage, Angra had as many as nine convents, each with its own cloisters and churches. Most of these churches are from the Mannerist and Baroque periods, and they are remarkably grand if we bear in mind the poor quality of the stone to be found on the island. The interior decoration of these churches relied on the use of both traditional carved and gilded woodwork and the rich and exotic woods of Brazil.

On the &quot;Ladeira de São Francisco&quot; in central Angra is the &quot;Igreja da Nossa Senhora da Guia&quot; (Church of Our Lady of Guia), where the seafarer Paulo da Gama is buried. He accompanied his brother Vasco da Gama on his first sea voyage to India in 1497.
* Chapel/Hospital of Nossa Senhora da Boa Nova ()
* Chapel of the Misericórdia of São Sebastião ()
* Church of the Society of Jesus College ()
* Convent of the Conceptionists ()
* Convent of São Gonçalo (), established in 1542, through the initiative of nobleman Brás Pires do Canto, to shelter the Clarisse sisters, surviving to 1832 when it was the only surviving convent after the expulsion of the religious orders. It is considered one of the best surviving Baroque era religious institutions in the Azores.
* Convent of Santo António dos Capuchos ()
* Hermitage of Santo Cristo do Cruzeiro ()
* (Old) Church of São Mateus da Calheta ()

==Culture==

===Azorean bullfight===

The Portuguese version of bullfighting differs considerably from its Spanish counterpart, and the Azorean variety, which began on Terceira, differs from the mainland style in some important respects also. The Azorean bullfight ritual involves &quot;audience participation&quot; in a way that recalls the &quot;running of the bulls&quot; at Pamplona (Spain).

On Terceira, 4 fighting bulls are enclosed in separate wooden crates for several hours and transported to the village where the bullfight will happen, then a long stout rope is secured around each bull&#x27;s neck. Fireworks are exploded to signal the citizens that a bull will soon be let loose in the public square. Once the bull is released, some young men take hold of the rope to try to control the bull&#x27;s head, and others taunt the bull with everything from brightly colored fighting capes to parasols. A ensues while the bull drags some men around by the rope and tries to punish his tormenters, by butting them to the ground and goring them (with blunted horns), or by trampling over them. This is a popular leisure activity and public entertainment; it is known as the &quot;tourada à corda&quot; ().

Eventually, the bull is funneled through the city streets to the bullring, the &quot;Praça de Toiros da Ilha&quot; (Island Bullring), in the eastern part of Angra, where a traditional Portuguese-style bullfight is held. From May 1 to September 30, there are daily touradas; in fact, sometimes there are two or three in one day.

==Education==
The University of the Azores, which has its principal campus on the island of São Miguel, has a subsidiary campus in Angra do Heroísmo, where the Department of Agrarian Sciences (&quot;Departamento de Ciências Agrárias&quot;) is located. This institution is a center for advanced scientific and agricultural studies, and it attracts students from the entire archipelago, as well as foreign students from many countries.

The &quot;Instituto Histórico da Ilha Terceira&quot; (IHIT), which means, in Portuguese, the &quot;Terceira Island Historical Institute&quot;, is a private cultural association, dedicated to the investigation and study of the history of the Azores. It is organized as an academy, and it sponsors classes, lectures, and symposia on various topics. The institute was founded in 1942 by the city of Angra do Heroísmo.

==Sport==
Angra has a football team, named S.C. Angrense, that is part of the Associação de Futebol de Angra do Heroísmo. Sport Clube Lusitânia houses the main football and basketball teams on the island. The region&#x27;s football association is located in Angra do Heroísmo.

<text>Shepherd University is a public university in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. In the fall of 2023, the university enrolled 3,274 students.

==History==
Shepherd University began when the county seat of Jefferson County, West Virginia, was moved from its temporary location in Shepherdstown back to Charles Town in July 1871. The people of Shepherdstown and vicinity decided to use the vacated courthouse for educational purposes. An article of incorporation for a school to be known as Shepherd College, designed to instruct students “in languages, arts and sciences,” was drawn up and signed by C. W. Andrews, Alexander R. Boteler, C. T. Butler, G. M. Beltzhoover, David Billmyer, Samuel Knott, and Henry Shepherd. This body of incorporators gave itself the power to elect instructors, pay salaries, and prescribe courses of study. Professor Joseph McMurran was appointed the first principal of the institution, which opened with 42 students in September 1871, under the authority of the board of trustees.

On February 27, 1872, the Legislature of West Virginia passed the following act: “That a branch of the State Normal School be and it is hereby established at the building known as Shepherd College, in Shepherdstown, in Jefferson County.”
Shepherd became a four-year college for the training of teachers on July 1, 1930, at which time the institution began granting the bachelor of arts degree. Shepherd was authorized to implement liberal arts programs in 1943, and in 1950 the Bachelor of Science degree was added. Also in 1950 Shepherd was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and in 1951 it became a member of the Association of American Colleges. On April 7, 2004, Governor Bob Wise signed legislation allowing Shepherd College to change its name to Shepherd University.

In the past two decades, Shepherd has added 11 new buildings, including the $9 million Robert C. Byrd Science and Technology Center; the $18 million addition to the Scarborough Library, which also houses the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education; and the $10 million nursing classroom building. The $21.6 million Wellness Center opened on June 11, 2009, and includes a 25-yard, eight-lane pool; two basketball courts, and six basketball hoops; two racquetball courts; an indoor elevated 1/10-mile jogging track; two multi-purpose rooms with mirrored walls for group exercise classes; a 7,500+ square foot weight and fitness area; and a dining venue operated by Shepherd&#x27;s Dining Services.

Potomac Place, a new 298-bed dormitory on the West Campus, opened in August 2017.

Mary J. C. Hendrix was inaugurated as the university&#x27;s sixteenth president of Shepherd University on April 8, 2016.

The Contemporary American Theater Festival is an annual festival of new plays by American playwrights, most often premieres or second or third productions. CATF focuses on plays that deal with contemporary issues that boldly challenge and entertain audiences.

Since 1991, CATF has produced 127 plays written by 90 playwrights, including 52 world premieres, 11 of which were commissioned. Adventurous audiences from 38 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, and Europe have attended the Theater Festival&#x27;s productions. The plays are professionally produced using Actors&#x27; Equity Association&#x27;s LORT D contract; CATF operates under agreements from AEA, United Scenic Artists, and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers.

===George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War===

The George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War is home to Shepherd University&#x27;s academic concentrations related to the Civil War and 19th Century America. The program requires students to complete specialized courses in addition to the courses already required of all history majors. Courses concentrate on various elements of 19th century history such as The American Civil War, 1850–1865; the Reconstruction Era; African American History; Soldiers and Society, 1861–65; and the Old South. Students also conduct primary research within the topic area and must intern at one of various historic sites in the region, such as Harpers Ferry National Historic Site.

The ongoing research mission at the George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War involves the compilation of figures from the soldiers&#x27; compiled military service records which will lead to a more definitive number of veterans. Ongoing research includes gleaning data from the service records of soldiers serving in all of West Virginia&#x27;s Union regiments and (Western) Virginia Confederate regiments was compiled in the center&#x27;s electronic database. Once completed, a simple query will be able to provide a very accurate total for both sides including data heretofore unavailable to historians.

The center is headed by Civil War historian James J. Broomall.

===The Bonnie and Bill Stubblefield Institute for Civil Political Communications===
The Bonnie and Bill Stubblefield Institute for Civil Political Communications is a non-partisan collaboration of political science scholars, students, and activists that hosts lectures, debates, and public forums at Shepherd University. The Stubblefield Institute’s mission is to “promote greater public awareness of how authentic and factual civil discourse across partisan divides leads to more productive debate and understanding.”  

Since opening its doors in 2019, the Stubblefield Institute leads a variety of student-focused initiatives on Shepherd University’s campus. The student-run Shepherd University Civility Club hosts events for students to debate current topics in a civil space. “Listen. Learn. Engage.” Is a student programming initiative to assist students in developing the skills and confidence to participate in civil discussion. Additionally, the Stubblefield Institute hosts Community Engage Conversations, public forums focusing on local and West Virginia issues.

<text>Leqa Naqamte, also known as Leqa Neqemte, was a polity from 1841 to 1897 in what later became the Welega Province of Ethiopia. It was formed as an outgrowth of the power of the city of Nekemte which remained its capital. Its growth came as a result of the power-extending policies of Bekere Godana. In 1897 it was incorporated into Ethiopia by the expansionist policies of Menelik.

<doc id="1127239" wikidata="Q617567" url="?curid=1127239" title="Cufflink">
<text>Cufflinks are items of jewelry that are used to secure the cuffs of dress shirts. Cufflinks can be manufactured from a variety of different materials, such as glass, stone, leather, metal, precious metal or combinations of these. Securing of the cufflinks is usually achieved via toggles or reverses based on the design of the front section, which can be folded into position. There are also variants with chains or a rigid, bent rear section. The front sections of the cufflinks can be decorated with gemstones, inlays, inset material or enamel and designed in two or three-dimensional forms.

Cufflinks are designed only for use with shirts that have cuffs with buttonholes on two sides but no buttons. These may be either single or double-length (&quot;French&quot;) cuffs, and may be worn either &quot;kissing&quot;, with both edges pointing outward, or &quot;barrel-style&quot;, with one edge pointing outward and the other one inward so that its hem is overlapped. In the US, the &quot;barrel-style&quot; was popularized by a famous 19th-century entertainer and clown, Dan Rice; however, &quot;kissing hot dogs&quot; cuffs are usually preferred.

==Design==

=== Closing mechanism ===
Cufflink designs vary widely, with the most traditional the &quot;double-panel&quot;, consisting of a short post or (more often) chain connecting two circular disc-shaped parts, both decorated. Whale-back and toggle-back cufflinks have a flat decorated face for one side, while the other side shows only the swivel-bar and its post. The swivel bar is placed vertically (aligned with the post) to put the links on and off, then horizontally to hold them in place when worn. The decorated face on the most visible side is usually larger; a variety of designs can connect the smaller piece: It may be small enough to fit through the buttonhole as a button would; it may be separated and attached from the other side; or it may have a portion that swivels on the central post, aligning with the post while the link is threaded through the button-hole and swiveling into a position at right angles to the post when worn.

Links of knotted brightly colored silk enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1990s, joined by an elasticated section because they looked fashionable. 

=== Motif ===
The visible part of a cufflink is often monogrammed or decorated in some way, such as with a birthstone or something which reflects a hobby or association. There are numerous styles including novelty, traditional, or contemporary. Cufflinks can and have been worn with tuxedos casual wear, informal attire or business suits, all the way to very dressy styles such as semi-formal (black tie or Stroller), and formal wear (morning dress or white tie), where they become essentially required and are matched with shirt studs. Colorful and whimsical cufflink designs are usually only suitable for casual and relatively informal events and signals someone who is fun-loving, approachable, and friendly. However, formal wear has stricter expectations, with pearl cufflinks being preferred for white tie events Traditionally it was considered important to coordinate the metal of one&#x27;s cufflinks with other jewelry such as watch case, belt buckle, tie bar or rings. experts prescribe gold to be worn during the daytime and silver for evening wear, but neither expectation is considered as critical as it once was.

=== Fabric cufflinks ===
An alternative type of cufflink is the cheaper silk knot which is usually two conjoined monkey&#x27;s fist or Turk&#x27;s head knots. The Paris shirtmaker Charvet is credited with their introduction in 1904. They became quickly popular: &quot;Charvet [link] buttons of twisted braid are quite the style&quot; noted &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1908. French cuff shirts are often accompanied with a set of colour-coordinated silk knots instead of double-button cufflinks. They are now often not from silk and consist of fabric over an elasticated core. Owing to the popularity of this fashion, metal cufflinks shaped to look like a silk knot are also worn.

=== Interchangeable cufflinks ===
Interchangeable cufflinks have started to come back into the marketplace in recent years. Cartier introduced their type in the 1960s consisting of a bar with a loop at either end that would allow a motif to be inserted at either end perpendicular to the bar. Cartier referred to the interchangeable motifs as batons. A set including the bars would come with batons made from coral, carnelian, lapis lazuli, rock crystal, onyx, tiger&#x27;s eye and malachite. Bars would have been made from stainless steel, sterling silver or 18k gold.

Cartier recently re-introduced these interchangeable cufflinks with batons made from striped chalcedony, silver obsidian, malachite, sodalite, and red tiger&#x27;s eye. The accompanying bars are made from 18k gold or palladium plated sterling silver. The securing mechanism is the same for either series using a small screw inset into the looped end of the bar. The pressure exerted by the screw on the baton holds them in place.

Another type of interchangeable system was created by pranga &amp; co. The cufflink system comes apart allowing the motif, referred to as an Anker, to slide on. Putting the cufflink back together secures the anker into the cufflink allowing it to be worn. pranga &amp; co&#x27;s cufflink is simple and similar in concept to charm bracelet bead systems popularized by companies like Pandora Jewelry. The ankers used in the cufflinks are interchangeable with various charm bracelets systems and visa-versa.

==History==

Although the first cufflinks appeared in the 1600s, they did not become common until the end of the 18th century. Their development is closely related to that of the men&#x27;s shirt. Men have been wearing shirt-like items of clothing since the invention of woven fabric 5,000 years BC. Although styles and methods of manufacturing changed, the underlying form remained the same: a tunic opened to the front with sleeves and collar. The shirt was worn directly next to the skin, it was washable and thereby protected the outer garments from contact with the body. Conversely, it also protected the skin against the rougher and heavier fabrics of jackets and coats by covering the neck and wrists.

After the Middle Ages, the visible areas of the shirt (neck, chest, shoulder and wrists) became sites of decorative elements such as frills, ruffs, and embroidery. The cuffs were held together with ribbons, as collared, an early precursor of neckties. Frills that hung down over the wrist were worn at court and other formal settings until the end of the 18th century, whilst in the everyday shirts of the time, the sleeves ended with a simple ribbon or were secured with a button or a connected pair of buttons.

In the 19th century, the former splendor of the aristocracy was superseded by the bourgeois efficiency of the newly employed classes. From then onward men wore a highly conventional wardrobe: a dark suit by day, a dinner jacket, or tailcoat in the evening. By the middle of the 19th century, modern cufflinks became popular. The shirt front as well as collar and cuffs covering areas of the most wear were made sturdier. This was practical but when clean and starched, collars and cuffs underscored the formal character of the clothing. However, they could be too stiff to secure the cuffs with a simple button. As a consequence, from the mid 19th century onward men in the middle and upper classes wore cufflinks. The industrial revolution meant that these could be mass-produced, making them available in every price category.

Colored cufflinks made from gemstones and diamonds were initially only worn by men with a great deal of self-confidence, however. This situation changed when the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, popularised colorful Fabergé cufflinks in the 19th century. During this time cufflinks became fashion accessories and one of the few acceptable items of jewelry for men in Britain and the U.S.

This development continued into the early 1900s, with more cufflinks worn than ever before. These were available in every type of form, color, and material, incorporating both gemstones and less precious stones and glass in cheaper copies. Intricate colored enameled cufflinks in every conceivable geometric pattern were especially popular. All of these were of equal value, as Coco Chanel had made fashion jewelry acceptable to wear. In a parallel development, however, a sportier style of shirt emerged with unstarched cuffs that could be secured with simple buttons.

This spread to Europe as well over the same period. In Germany, Idar-Oberstein and Pforzheim were key centers of cufflink production. Whilst in Idar-Oberstein cufflinks were produced using simple materials for the more modest budget, the Pforzheim jewelry manufacturers produced for the medium and upper segments using genuine gold and silver. In Pforzheim, premium cufflinks are still produced today, some of them to historic patterns, some modern, all of them using traditional craftsmanship.

Following the end of shortages related to the Second World War, into the 1950s a gentleman liked to adorn himself with a whole range of accessories, comprising items such as cigarette case, lighter, tie pin or tie bar, watch (now worn mostly on the wrist instead of the pocket), ring, key chain, money clip, etc., an ensemble that also included a wide range of cufflinks.
In the 1970s cufflinks were less emphasized in much of middle-class fashion. Fashion was dominated by the Woodstock generation, with shirts primarily manufactured complete with buttons and buttonholes. Many fine heirlooms were reworked into earrings.

The 1980s saw a return to traditional cufflinks, as part of a general revival in traditional male dress. This trend has more or less continued to this day.

<doc id="1127254" wikidata="Q7270141" url="?curid=1127254" title="Queen's University of Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast was a university constituency represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Parliament from 1918 until 1950.

It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) elected by the first-past-the-post voting system.

==Franchise==
The MP was rather elected by the graduates of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

==First Dáil==
After the 1918 election, Sinn Féin invited all those elected for constituencies in Ireland to sit as TDs in Dáil Éireann rather than in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. All those elected for Irish constituencies were included in the roll of the Dáil but only those elected for Sinn Féin sat in the First Dáil. In May 1921, the Dáil passed a resolution declaring that elections to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland would be used as the election for the Second Dáil and that the First Dáil would be dissolved on the assembly of the new body. The graduates of Queen&#x27;s would then have been represented in the Dáil by the four-seat constituency of Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, which also returned no representatives for Sinn Féin.

==Members of Parliament==
==Politics and History of the constituency==
University constituencies had existed in the United Kingdom Parliament and its predecessors since 1603 and in 1918 Queen&#x27;s was enfranchised as such. When the Parliament of Northern Ireland was established, the same franchise was preserved - see Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency).

As with most other Northern Ireland seats in this period, the electorate was heavily inclined towards the Ulster Unionists, with no contests for the Westminster seat taking place at all in the interwar years.

Under the Representation of the People Act 1948, university constituencies at Westminster were abolished with effect at the 1950 United Kingdom general election.

<text>George Elias Khoury (1983 - March 19, 2004, , ) was an Israeli Arab murdered by a Palestinian terrorist while jogging in the neighborhood of French Hill in Jerusalem. Khoury, son of Elias Khoury, a prominent lawyer, was a law student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the military branch of the Fatah movement, claimed responsibility for the attack. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Palestinian gunman mistook him for a Jew.&quot; Khoury&#x27;s father said, &quot;I am against all violent attacks against innocent civilians whether it be against Israeli civilians or Palestinian civilians.&quot;

Fatah apologized and offered to declare him a martyr for the Palestinian cause. Ibrahim Kandalaft, Arafat&#x27;s adviser on Christian affairs, eulogized Khoury on behalf of the PA chairman, describing him as a shaheed (martyr) of the Palestinian cause. But the victim&#x27;s mother interrupted him by declaring that her son was an &quot;angel, not a shaheed.&quot;

George&#x27;s grandfather, Daoud Khoury, was also assassinated in an attack in Jerusalem, when a booby-trapped refrigerator exploded at Zion Square.

Khoury was buried in the Christian cemetery on Mount Zion.

<text>François (; –1669) and Michel Anguier (; 1612–1686) were two French brothers and sculptors.

==Lives==
They were natives of Eu in Normandy, and served their apprenticeship in the studio of Simon Guillain. François Anguier died in 1669. Michel Anguier died in Paris on 11 July 1686.

==Works==
The chief works of François were the monument to Cardinal de Bérulle, the founder of the Carmelite order, which formerly occupied the chapel of the oratory at Paris, and the mausoleum of Henri II, the last duke of Montmorency, at Moulins. Of the monument to Cardinal de Bérulle, all but the bust have been destroyed.

Michel directed the decoration of the church of Val-de-Grâce from 1662 to 1667. A marble group of the Nativity in the church of Val-de-Grâce is reckoned his masterpiece. He was also credited with the sculptures of the triumphal arch at the Porte Saint-Denis (), which served as a memorial of the conquests of Louis XIV, and he supervised the decoration of the apartments of Anne of Austria in the old Louvre. Nicolas Fouquet also employed him for his château, Vaux-le-Vicomte.

<text>Degnepoll or Deknepollen is a neighborhood in Kinn Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. Deknepollen is located on the mainland and it is an eastern suburb of the town of Måløy (which is located on the island of Vågsøy), which it is connected to by a long Måløy Bridge. It is also located about west of the village of Bryggja. The village of Tennebø is located about southeast of Deknepollen, with the lake Degnepollvatnet located between the two villages. Before the Måløy Bridge was constructed, there was a ferry from Deknepollen to Måløy.
The name Deknepollen could be roughly translated as a &quot;small fjord arm by the deacon&quot;. &quot;Degnepoll&quot; is also a surname used by some families originating from the community or still living there. The estimated population (2001) of Deknepollen is 245.

The main industry is fish processing and the main production facility produces fish oil and animal fodder. This factory was under construction during World War II and was destroyed during Operation Archery days before it could have been put into operation. Degnepoll has a combined post office, gas station, and fast food vendor in addition to an electronics shop, two car dealerships, and two supermarkets.

<text>Constantan, also known in various contexts as Eureka, Advance, and Ferry, refers to a copper-nickel alloy commonly used for its stable electrical resistance across a wide range of temperatures. It usually consists of 55% copper and 45% nickel. Its main feature is the low thermal variation of its resistivity, which is constant over a wide range of temperatures. Other alloys with similarly low temperature coefficients are known, such as manganin (Cu [86%] / Mn [12%] / Ni [2%] ).

==History==
In 1887, Edward Weston discovered that metals can have a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, inventing what he called his &quot;Alloy No. 2.&quot;
It was produced in Germany where it was renamed &quot;Konstantan&quot;.

==Constantan alloy==
Of all alloys used in modern strain gauges, constantan is the oldest, and still the most widely used. This situation reflects the fact that constantan has the best overall combination of properties needed for many strain gauge applications. This alloy has, for example, an adequately high strain sensitivity, or gauge factor, which is relatively insensitive to strain level and temperature. Its resistivity () is high enough to achieve suitable resistance values in even very small grids, and its temperature coefficient of resistance is fairly low. In addition, constantan is characterized by a good fatigue life and relatively high elongation capability. However, constantan tends to exhibit a continuous drift at temperatures above ; and this characteristic should be taken into account when zero stability of the strain gauge is critical over a period of hours or days. Constantan is also used for electrical resistance heating and thermocouples.

==A-alloy==
Very importantly, constantan can be processed for self-temperature compensation to match a wide range of test material coefficients of thermal expansion. A-alloy is supplied in self-temperature-compensation (S-T-C) numbers 00, 03, 05, 06, 09, 13, 15, 18, 30, 40, and 50, for use on test materials with corresponding thermal expansion coefficients, expressed in parts per million by length (or μm/m) per degrees Fahrenheit.

==P alloy==
For the measurement of very large strains, 5% (50,000 microstrain) or above, annealed constantan (P alloy) is the grid material normally selected. Constantan in this form is very ductile; and, in gauge lengths of and longer, can be strained to &gt;20%. It should be borne in mind, however, that under high cyclic strains the P alloy will exhibit some permanent resistivity change with each cycle, and cause a corresponding zero shift in the strain gauge. Because of this characteristic and the tendency for premature grid failure with repeated straining, P alloy is not ordinarily recommended for cyclic strain applications. P alloy is available with S-T-C numbers of 08 and 40 for use on metals and plastics, respectively.

==Physical properties==
==Temperature measurement==
Constantan is also used to form thermocouples with wires made of iron, copper, or chromel. It has an extraordinarily strong negative Seebeck coefficient above 0 degrees Celsius, leading to a good temperature sensitivity.

<text>Martin Rodbell (December 1, 1925 – December 7, 1998) was an American biochemist and molecular endocrinologist who is best known for his discovery of G-proteins. He shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Alfred G. Gilman for &quot;their discovery of G-proteins and the role of these proteins in signal transduction in cells.&quot;

==Biography==
Rodbell was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Shirley (née Abrams) and Milton Rodbell, a grocer. His family was Jewish. After graduating from the Baltimore City College high school, he entered Johns Hopkins University in 1943, with interests in biology and French existential literature. In 1944, his studies were interrupted by his military service as a U.S. Navy radio operator during World War II. He returned to Hopkins in 1946 and received his B.S. in biology in 1949. In 1950, he married Barbara Charlotte Ledermann, a former friend of Margot Frank, diarist Anne Frank&#x27;s older sister. Martin and Barbara had four children. Rodbell received his Ph.D. in biochemistry at the University of Washington in 1954. He did post-doctoral work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1954 to 1956. In 1956, Rodbell accepted a position as a research biochemist at the National Heart Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1985, Rodbell became Scientific Director of the NIH&#x27;s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina where he worked until his retirement in 1994. He was also adjunct professor of Cell Biology at Duke University (from 1991 to 1998) and adjunct professor of pharmacology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He died in Chapel Hill of multiple organ failure after an extended illness.
===Research===
Reflecting the increasingly common analogies between computer science and biology in the 1960s, Rodbell believed that the fundamental information processing systems of both computers and biological organisms were similar. He asserted that individual cells were analogous to cybernetic systems made up of three distinct molecular components: discriminators, transducers, and amplifiers (otherwise known as effectors). The discriminator, or cell receptor, receives information from outside the cell; a cell transducer processes this information across the cell membrane; and the amplifier intensifies these signals to initiate reactions within the cell or to transmit information to other cells.

In December 1969 and early January 1970, Rodbell was working with a laboratory team that studied the effect of the hormone glucagon on a rat liver membrane receptor—the cellular discriminator that receives outside signals. Rodbell discovered that ATP (adenosine triphosphate) could reverse the binding action of glucagon to the cell receptor and thus dissociate the glucagon from the cell altogether. He then noted that traces of GTP (guanosine triphosphate) could reverse the binding process almost one thousand times faster than ATP. Rodbell deduced that GTP was probably the active biological factor in dissociating glucagon from the cell&#x27;s receptor, and that GTP had been present as an impurity in his earlier experiments with ATP. This GTP, he found, stimulated the activity in the guanine nucleotide protein (later called the G-protein), which, in turn, produced profound metabolic effects in the cell. This activation of the G-protein, Rodbell postulated, was the &quot;second messenger&quot; process that Earl W. Sutherland had theorized. In the language of signal transduction, the G-protein, activated by GTP, was the principal component of the transducer, which was the crucial link between the discriminator and the amplifier. Later, Rodbell postulated, and then provided evidence for, additional G-proteins at the cell receptor that could inhibit and activate transduction, often at the same time. In other words, cellular receptors were sophisticated enough to have several different processes going on simultaneously.

<text>Cameron Potts (born 10 November 1971 in Subiaco, Western Australia), is a musician based in Melbourne. Since 1999, he has toured regularly to the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Scandinavia and Iceland with both Ninetynine, playing drums, and Baseball, playing violin. His band Cuba Is Japan toured the Far East in 2009. and a 5 date tour of China supporting Angie Hart. He is not to be confused with Sydney musician Cameron Potts, lead singer and guitarist of Dead Letter Chorus.

==Biography==
===Early Years (Perth 1971-1992)===

Potts is originally from Perth, and started playing drums in 1987. He played in several bands in Perth. His first band Bad News (later Poetic Justice, with brother Jason Potts, Greg Periera, Richard Mortimer and Amy Carney, daughter of Bernard Carney) played the 1989 Claremont School of Art dance as the professional debut. 

He later joined and recorded with Thou Gideon and Manic Pizza before re-locating to Melbourne in 1992. 

===Melbourne (1992-2020)===
In 1994 Potts joined with Gareth Edwards to form Sandro, with Edwards on guitar and vocals and Nick Carroll on bass. Sandro released its first album, &quot;Live by Rivers&quot; in November 1996, which was followed by tours with Palace Brothers, Dirty Three and Smog, later releasing &quot;Hate Songs&quot; in 1997. The album attracted significant national airplay from Triple J, press in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Juice&quot; and national airplay for the &quot;Rainy Season&quot; clip on &quot;Rage&quot;, Channel V and MTV. After a tour of the United States built around the completion of Sandro&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Flux&quot;, Potts left the band playing his last show with them in New York. Returning home, he then went on to join Ninetynine, which was initially established as a solo side project by Sleater Kinney drummer Laura MacFarlane and Rhonda Simmonds. They recorded the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;767&quot;, with Simmonds on bass; Potts and MacFarlane sharing drums, vibraphone, and Casiotone keyboards; and MacFarlane on guitars, vocals, and xylophone. Simmonds left to join Origami and was replaced by Iain McIntyre and Michelle Mansford. A 75 date tour of the US, Canada and Europe followed, and with this lineup they recorded the album, &quot;180°&quot;, in 2000. Mansford left after another long international tour in late 2001 and replaced by Amy Clarke (formerly of Vivian Girls). The band recorded with producer Lindsey Gravina releasing &quot;The Process&quot; in 2002. They also that year released a compilation of rarities and odd 7&quot; B-Sides, &quot;Anatomy of Distance&quot;. Following this was another long tour of Europe and Japan. Clarke left Ninetynine in 2006 after the release of &quot;Worlds of Space, Worlds of Population, Worlds of Robots&quot; and was replaced by Meg Butler, with further touring to the US, Canada and Mexico, including a recording session at Motown studios in Detroit.

On his third trip to Egypt in 2001, he acquired his first violin , an event that eventually led to the formation of Baseball, a Middle East influenced fusion band. During a stint in Scotland he met Monika Fikerle (Love of Diagrams) in November 2002 and with bassist, Steve Begovich, they toured Europe, Scandinavia and Japan. After returning from overseas, the group began recording their first album, &quot;Gods and Stars, Priests and Kings&quot;, with new bassist and keyboardist, Yoshi Araki in mid-2003. In November of that year, Baseball returned to Europe with Love of Diagrams, playing 28 shows across eleven countries, finishing in Osaka, Japan. Araki was not allowed re-entry into Australia and so Baseball underwent the line up change in early 2005 that would cement the foundings for the rest of their career. Ben Butcher joined to play guitar (ex Jihad Against America) and Evelyn Morris joined on drums (Pikelet/True Radical Miracle). Now a four piece with Monika switching from Piano Accordion to bass, and Potts solely on violin and vocals, they were invited to play at the Hohaiyan Rock Concert in Taiwan and released an EP, &quot;Taiwan/Japan Tour EP&quot; in 2005. In 2007, the group recorded &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; at Head Gap in Melbourne and then undertook an extensive self-funded tour of Europe, taking in Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia, before heading into Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK. 2008 finally saw the release of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;, and three separate national tours followed: one with The Mountain Goats, another with Snowman and their own set of dates to launch the album. Original guitarist Steve Begovich died from MS complications in 2008 and by the start of 2009, the band began to focus on other projects with Potts forming Cuba is Japan, Fikerle performing with Love of Diagrams and Morris with Pikelet. In 2011 Baseball played their first show in three years, a fundraiser for Japanese earthquake victims, in Melbourne.

Potts has played in a number of other Melbourne bands including: Crank, Peachfuzz, Trippin Phil&#x27;s All Ska&#x27;s, Sea Haggs, Manic Pizza, and Perth group Thou Gideon,

In 2012 his group membership included Cuba is Japan, Montero (with Guy Blackman, Geoff O&#x27;Connor and Ben Montero) and High Tea which includes former Baseball guitarist Ben Butcher, guitarist Kim Sills and Cuba is Japan violinist/keyboardist James Heenan playing bass. He is also a session drummer in Melbourne, playing on Regurgitator&#x27;s 2010 EP &quot;Distractions&quot; and performing live with Japanese Avant Garde Legends Boredoms. He also played on Nick Allbrook&#x27;s (Pond/Tame Impala) solo album &quot;Pure Gardiya&quot; (2015).

===Perth (2020 - current)===
Potts moved back to Perth in 2020, to concentrate on art and writing, he was involved in the Poetic Justice reunion after 31 years.

==Other activities==
Potts is a graduate of Perth&#x27;s Claremont School of Art, majoring in painting. He has exhibited and sold photographs from his world travels. Published works are a children&#x27;s book &quot;In Fitzroy, The Flowers Grew So High&quot; (1993). and a collection of poems called &quot;A Headache of Happiness&quot; (1995).

Potts is also a writer and photographer.

<doc id="1127291" wikidata="Q61872806" url="?curid=1127291" title="Murder of Junko Furuta">
<text>was a 17-year-old Japanese high school student who was abducted, raped, tortured, and murdered. Her abuse was mainly perpetrated by four male teenagers, Hiroshi Miyano (18), Jō Ogura (17), Shinji Minato (16), and Yasushi Watanabe (17), and took place over a 40-day period starting on 25 November 1988. In Japan, the case is known as the , as her body was discovered inside of a concrete-filled drum. The prison sentences served by the perpetrators ranged from 7 to 20 years. The brutality of the case shocked Japan, and it is said to be the worst case of juvenile crime in the country&#x27;s post-war history.

== Background ==
Furuta was born on 18 January 1971 and grew up in Misato, Saitama Prefecture, where she lived with her parents, older brother, and younger brother. At the time of her murder, she was a 17-year-old senior at Yashio-Minami High School, and worked a part-time job at a plastic molding factory from October 1988 to save up money for a planned graduation trip. Furuta also accepted a job at an electronics retailer, where she planned on working after graduation. Furuta was well-liked by her classmates and teachers, and had high grades and infrequent absences. According to her friends, she dreamed of becoming an idol singer.

The perpetrators of the murder were four male teenagers: , , , and , who in court documents were referred to as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;, respectively. Tetsuo Nakamura and Koichi Ihara (both 16) were referred to as &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;. The four main perpetrators had each dropped out of high school in the summer of 1988, and became involved in organized crime as &quot;chinpira&quot; (low-ranking &quot;yakuza&quot;). They began using Minato&#x27;s family home in Adachi, Tokyo, as a hangout. Beginning in October, they engaged in various crimes including theft (purse snatching and car theft), assault, and rape. On 8 November, the group abducted a 19-year-old woman in Adachi and gang raped her in a hotel there. On 27 December, during Furuta&#x27;s captivity, the group abducted another 19-year-old woman in Adachi and gang-raped her in a motel there.

== Kidnapping and abuse ==
On the evening of 25 November 1988, Miyano and Minato rode around Misato on their motorcycles with the intention of robbing and raping local women, and spotted Furuta, who was on her way home from her part-time job. Acting on Miyano&#x27;s orders, Minato kicked Furuta off her bicycle and fled the scene. Miyano, under the pretense of witnessing the attack by coincidence, approached Furuta and offered to walk her home. After further gaining her trust, Miyano walked Furuta to a nearby warehouse and threatened her, telling her that he was a &quot;yakuza&quot; member and that he would spare her only if she followed his orders.

That night, Miyano took Furuta by taxi to a hotel in Adachi, where he raped her. He later called Minato&#x27;s house and bragged to Ogura about the rape, after which Ogura told him not to let Furuta leave. In the early morning hours of 26 November, Miyano took Furuta to a park near the hotel, where Ogura, Minato, and Watanabe were waiting. They told her they knew where she lived, and that the &quot;yakuza&quot; would kill her family if she attempted to escape. Minato agreed to allow Furuta to be confined in a room on the second floor of his house in Adachi for the purpose of gang raping her. Furuta was held captive a total of 40 days.

On 27 November, Furuta&#x27;s parents contacted the police about her disappearance. To discourage further investigation, the kidnappers forced Furuta to call her mother three times to convince her that she had run away but was safe and staying with friends. When Minato&#x27;s parents were present at the house where she was being confined, Furuta was forced to act as his girlfriend. The group dropped this pretense when it became clear that Minato&#x27;s parents would not report them to the police. The parents later claimed that they did not intervene because they were afraid of their son, who had been increasingly violent toward them.

On the night of 28 November, Miyano and the others, along with Nakamura and Ihara, gang raped Furuta, after which Miyano shaved her pubic hair with a razor and used a match to burn her genital area. In early December, as punishment for an escape attempt, the group repeatedly punched Furuta in the face, and Miyano burned her ankles with a lighter. They forced Furuta to dance to music while naked, masturbate in front of them, and stand on the balcony in the middle of the night with little clothing, and inserted objects into her vagina and anus, including a metal rod and a bottle. They also forced her to drink large amounts of alcohol, milk, and water, smoke two cigarettes at once, and inhale paint thinner fumes. In one attack in the middle of the month, Furuta was beaten by the group on the pretext that Miyano had stepped on a puddle of her urine, after which he burned her thighs and hands several times with lighter fluid. From around this time, Furuta, unable to bear the repeated assaults, would sometimes plead to be killed by her captors.

Throughout the rest of December, the severity of Furuta&#x27;s abuse continued to escalate, and by the end of the month she was severely malnourished after being fed only small amounts of food and eventually only milk. Due to her injuries, she had become unable to walk to the downstairs toilet, and was confined to the room&#x27;s floor in a state of extreme weakness. Her appearance had been altered by the beatings, with her face becoming swollen to the point of unrecognizability, and her wounds had started to emit a foul odor.

== Murder and investigation ==
On 4 January 1989, after losing money in a game of mahjong the night before, Miyano decided to take his anger out on Furuta. He ignited a candle and dripped hot wax on her face, placed two shortened candles on her eyelids, and forced her to drink her own urine. Furuta was lifted and kicked, fell onto a stereo unit, and began a fit of convulsions. To prevent them from being stained with blood, the group covered their hands in plastic bags before beating her with their fists and an iron exercise ball, and dropped the ball on her abdomen several times. Miyano poured lighter fluid on Furuta and set her on fire; she made weak attempts to put herself out, but soon stopped moving. The assault lasted for about two hours, after which Furuta died at 10 a.m.

Less than 24 hours after her death, Minato&#x27;s brother called to tell him that Furuta appeared to be dead. Afraid that their crime would be discovered, the group wrapped Furuta&#x27;s body in a blanket and placed it in a large travel bag, then put the bag in a metal drum and filled it with wet concrete. At around 8:00 p.m. on 5 January, the group drove to a vacant lot near a construction site on the island of Wakasu in Kōtō, Tokyo, and dumped the drum there. 

In early 1989, Miyano and Ogura were arrested for kidnapping and gang raping the 19-year-old woman in December 1988. When police interrogated Miyano, he wrongly believed that Ogura had already confessed to Furuta&#x27;s murder and that the police were aware of this, so he told them where to find her body. The police were initially puzzled by his confession, as they were questioning him about a different murder. The drum containing Furuta&#x27;s body was recovered on 29 March, and she was identified via fingerprints. Minato, Watanabe, Minato&#x27;s brother, Nakamura, and Ihara were also arrested.

== Trial and reaction ==
The identities of the defendants were sealed by the court, as they were all legally juveniles (under age 20). Journalists from the &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; tabloid uncovered their identities and published them, arguing that the accused did not deserve to have their right to anonymity upheld, given the severity of the crime. In July 1990, all were found guilty and sentenced by the Tokyo District Court for abduction for the purpose of sexual assault, confinement, rape, assault, murder, and abandonment of a corpse. All four appealed; in July 1991, three were re-sentenced to longer terms by the Tokyo High Court. 

* Hiroshi Miyano was originally sentenced to 17 years in prison, and re-sentenced to 20 years, the longest sentence typically given in Japan short of life imprisonment, which had been sought by the prosecution. Miyano&#x27;s parents sold their family home and paid Furuta&#x27;s parents ¥50 million (about US$350,000; $ today) in compensation, which their son&#x27;s defense presented as a mitigating circumstance. A court-ordered psychological evaluation at the trial established that Miyano had a learning disability that &quot;did not impair his brain function, but delayed his emotional development&quot;. After his release in 2009, he changed his last name to &quot;Yokoyama&quot;. He reportedly boasted about his &quot;yakuza&quot; connections and involvement in pyramid schemes. In 2013, Yokoyama was arrested on suspicion of bank fraud and placing scam phone calls, but remained silent and was not charged.

* Jō Ogura was sentenced to five to ten years in prison. He was released in 1999, changed his last name to &quot;Kamisaku&quot;, and began working in an IT position. In 2000, Kamisaku married a Chinese woman and moved to Chiba Prefecture, but divorced after a few years and returned to his mother&#x27;s home in Saitama. He lost his job after his past became known to his colleagues, and again became involved in the &quot;yakuza&quot;. In 2004, Kamisaku was arrested for assaulting Takatoshi Isono, a 27-year-old acquaintance whom he thought was involved with a girlfriend. He shoved Isono into the trunk of a car and drove to his mother&#x27;s bar in Misato, where he assaulted him for four hours. Kamisaku was sentenced to four years in prison. After his release in 2009, he relied on welfare and lived alone in an apartment in Saitama, where he died in an accident on 16 July 2022, at age 51.

* Shinji Minato was originally sentenced to five to six years in prison, and re-sentenced to five to nine years. His parents and brother were not charged. After his release in 1998, Minato moved in with his mother. In 2018, Minato (then unemployed) was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after striking a 32-year-old man in the shoulder with a metal baton and slashing his neck with a knife on a street in Kawaguchi, Saitama, during a dispute over a vehicle parking spot. In 2019, Minato was sentenced to one year and six months in prison, suspended with probation for three years.

* Yasushi Watanabe was originally sentenced to three to four years in prison, and re-sentenced to five to seven years. He appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court of Japan, but his appeal was denied in July 1992. He was released in 1996, after which he lived in an apartment with his mother in Tokyo. By 2005, Watanabe had developed a neurodegenerative disease, but did not have money to treat it. He died in May 2021, at age 49.
* Tetsuo Nakamura and Koichi Ihara, who had raped Furuta but did not participate in her murder, were released from juvenile detention by 2000.

From the time the case was first reported in the media, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (the investigating body) received many calls and letters from the general public demanding that the perpetrators be severely punished, including by life imprisonment or with the death penalty. The Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office, which had sought life imprisonment for Miyano during the trial, was criticized for not seeking life sentences for the other perpetrators, nor seeking the death penalty. The Tokyo District Court also received numerous calls and letters which criticized the perceived lightness of its sentencing, though a majority of legal professionals surveyed by the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; newspaper said that the sentences were appropriate based on precedent.

In the of 1988, the Nagoya District Court had sentenced the main defendant, a 19-year-old male, to death, and a second defendant, a 17-year-old male, to life imprisonment in June 1989; this case drew comparisons to the Furuta case. Hiroshi Itakura, a professor of law at Nihon University, commented that the difference in sentencing was explained by the difference in the number of victims (two in the Nagoya case, versus one in the Furuta case). Under the &quot;Nagayama standard&quot;, the death penalty in Japan is rarely applied in cases with one victim. Itakura also stated that the prosecution in the Nagoya murder case had demonstrated clear premeditation, while in the Furuta case the intent to murder was more uncertain.

== Aftermath ==
Furuta&#x27;s funeral was held on 2 April 1989. During the ceremony, one of her friends delivered a eulogy written by her classmates, which stated:
Furuta&#x27;s intended future employer presented her parents with the uniform she would have worn in her position, and it was placed in her casket. At her graduation, the principal presented her parents with her diploma. The location on Wakasu where her body was discovered is now an industrial zone.

<text>Batara Kala is the god of death in traditional Javanese and Balinese mythology, ruling over it in a cave along with Setesuyara. Batara Kala is also named the creator of light and the earth. He is also the god of time, who devours unlucky people.

== Origin myth ==

According to legend, Batara Kala is the son of Batara Guru (the Javanese version of Shiva). Batara Guru has a very beautiful wife named Dewi Uma (Parvati). One day Batara Guru, in a fit of uncontrolled lust, forced himself on Dewi Uma. They had sexual intercourse on top of his vahana Nandi, a divine cow. This behavior ashamed Uma, who cursed both of them so they appeared as fearsome and ugly ogres. This fierce form of Dewi Uma is also known in Hinduism as Durga. From this relationship, Batara Kala was born with the appearance of an ogre.

Another origin story is that he was conceived when a drop of Shiva&#x27;s semen was swallowed by a fish.

Batara Kala is described as having an insatiable appetite and being very rude. He was sent by the devas to Earth to punish humans for their evil habits. However, Batara Kala was interested only in devouring humans to satisfy his appetite. Alarmed, the devas then recalled Batara Kala from the Earth. He later became ruler of the underworld, together with the goddess Setesuyara.

Traditionally, Javanese people try to obtain his favor, as the god of time and destruction, to prevent misfortune, especially to children. Exorcism ceremonies, called &quot;ruwatan&quot;, are held for children born under &quot;unlucky&quot; circumstances, such as being born feet-first. This is to prevent such children from being devoured by Batara Kala. This ceremony usually includes a wayang (Javanese shadow puppets) performance and a selamatan feast.

==Symbolism==
Simon Monbaron notes that Batara Kala symbolizes the negative effects of having sexual relations in a fit of passion. Batara Kala&#x27;s negative aspects are described as a warning against the fate of all children born out of wedlock. Batara Kala&#x27;s function, especially as a Kirtimukha, has been considered similar to Bhoma in Indian and Balinese Hinduism.

<text>A tactical air navigation system, commonly referred to by the acronym TACAN, is a navigation system initially designed for naval aircraft to acquire moving landing platforms (i.e., ships) and later expanded for use by other military aircraft. It provides the user with bearing and distance (slant-range or hypotenuse) to a ground or ship-borne station. It is, from an end-user perspective, a more accurate version of the VOR/DME system that provides bearing and range information for civil aviation. The DME portion of the TACAN system is available for civil use; at VORTAC facilities where a VOR is combined with a TACAN, civil aircraft can receive VOR/DME readings. Aircraft equipped with TACAN avionics can use this system for enroute navigation as well as non-precision approaches to landing fields. However, a TACAN-only equipped aircraft cannot receive bearing information from a VOR-only station.

==History==

The TACAN navigation system is an evolution of radio transponder navigation systems that date back to the British Oboe system of World War II. In the United States, many companies were involved with the development of TACAN for military aircraft. Hoffman Laboratories Div. of the Hoffman Electronics Corp.–Military Products Division (now NavCom Defense Electronics) was a leader in developing the present TACAN system in the US starting in the late 1950s.

==Operation==
TACAN in general can be described as the military version of the VOR/DME system, though despite providing similar information as its civilian counterpart, its method of operation is significantly different. It operates in the UHF frequency band 962-1213 MHz, utilizing a pulse-pair transponder system not dissimilar to that of secondary surveillance RADAR. Interrogating aircraft transmit in the 1024-1150 MHz band, split into 1 MHz channels numbered 1-126; the responding station (ground, ship, or another aircraft) is 63 MHz (63 channels) above or below the originating frequency, depending on the channel and mode of operation selected. Spacing between pulses in an individual pulse-pair is also determined by TACAN operating mode.

===Ranging===
Range information is functionally identical to the method provided by civilian DME: pairs of 3.5 microsecond (μs) pulses (measured edge-to-edge at 50% modulation strength) from an aircraft are repeated by the station being interrogated, using the round-trip time to calculate slant-range distance. Randomized spacing between interrogation pulse-pairs allows the interrogator to separate its own signal from that of other aircraft, enabling multiple users to access the ranging function without mutual interference. A fixed-round trip delay time (dependent on system mode) is added to each pulse-pair when being retransmitted by its station. The interrogator will generate up to 150 pulse-pairs per second when first acquiring a station in range in &quot;search&quot; mode, then drop down to ≈30 per second when acquired in &quot;track&quot; mode. Memory circuits in the ranging function enable a track to be quickly reestablished when ranging pulses are temporarily suppressed by other TACAN functions (see below).

===Bearing===
Bearing information is derived from amplitude modulation (AM) of the responding station&#x27;s pulse-pair signals, the AM signal being generated via physical rotation of a station&#x27;s directional antenna or electronic steering of the same signal using an antenna array. Two AM signals are generated: a fundamental AM signal at 15 Hz, and an auxiliary AM signal (implemented using fixed signal reflectors in rotating-antenna installations) at 135 Hz, the ninth harmonic of the fundamental signal. These correspond to a &quot;coarse&quot; and &quot;fine&quot; bearing signal, the latter improving the accuracy of the former. The time is compared between the point of peak positive signal strength with a reference train or &quot;burst&quot; of pulse-pairs of specific repetition rate and duration, timed to transmit at a specific point in the signal&#x27;s sweep; these replace all other pulse types when transmitted. The civilian VOR system differs from TACAN in utilizing a single continuous-wave 30 Hz modulation signal, using the phase difference between a fixed-phase and variable phase (rotating) component to derive bearing info.

===Squitter function===
TACAN stations transmit pulse-pairs at a composite rate of 3600 pairs/second: 900 of which are bearing reference bursts, and the other 2700 being composed of ranging and identification pulses. When insufficient interrogation pulses from aircraft are present, the station will use a squitter circuit to inject additional randomized pulse-pairs to maintain the desired pulse rate. This ensures that sufficient signal is present to support demodulating bearing signals.

===Identification===
TACAN stations are identified by Morse code. The transmitting station periodically replaces the randomized ranging pulse-pairs with regularly spaced pairs that de-modulate to a 1350 Hz tone, keying a three-letter identification code at approximately 6-7 wpm every 40 seconds. Ranging and squitter pulses are permitted during the gaps between dots and dashes. There is no capability for voice transmission in a TACAN-only system.

===Operating modes===
There are two basic channel configurations available: X (the original implementation) and Y (added in the 1960s to expand available channels and reduce mutual interference between closely-spaced stations). These configurations differ in pulse-pair width, fixed receiver response delay, and polarity of frequency offset from the interrogation channel. TACAN interrogators can operate in four modes: receive (for bearing/identification only), transmit/receive (for bearing, range, and ID), and air-to-air versions of the previous two.

The typical TACAN onboard user panel has control switches for setting the channel (corresponding to the desired station&#x27;s assigned frequency), the operation mode for either transmit/receive (T/R, to get both bearing and range) or receive only (REC, to get bearing but not range). Capability was later upgraded to include an air-to-air mode (A/A), where two airborne users can get relative slant-range information depending on specific installations, though an air-to-air mode allows distance to be established between transmitters/receivers.

==Performance and accuracy==

When initially deployed, TACAN was intended to provide a bearing accuracy of ±0.22°, based on the main bearing signal&#x27;s own accuracy of ±2° and the corrections applied by the ninth-harmonic auxiliary bearing signal. Theoretically a TACAN should provide a 9-fold increase in accuracy compared to a VOR, but operational use has shown only an approximate 3-fold increase.

Operational accuracy of the 135 Hz azimuth component is ±1° or ±63 m at 3.75 km. 

Manufacturers of TACAN sets mention the ability to track stations out to 400NM, though these systems will cap their instrumented range signals at approximately 200NM. Per official FAA service volume information, reliable TACAN/DME reception can be guaranteed out to 130NM below 45,000 feet above the surface for a high-altitude certified unit.

On the first Space Shuttle flight, Capcom Joseph P. Allen reported up to the crew that their TACANs had locked onto the Channel 111X signals at St. Petersburg, FL at a range of 250 miles.

==Benefits==

Because the azimuth and range units are combined in one system it provides for simpler installation. Less space is required than a VOR because a VOR requires a large counterpoise and a fairly complex phased antenna system. A TACAN system theoretically might be placed on a building, a large truck, an airplane or a ship, and be operational in a short period of time. An airborne TACAN receiver can be used in air-to-air mode to provide the approximate distance between two coordinating aircraft by selecting channels with 63 channels of separation (e.g., aircraft #1 sets channel 29 into its TACAN and aircraft #2 sets channel 92 into its TACAN.). It does not provide relative bearing.

==Drawbacks==
For military usage a primary drawback is lack of the ability to control emissions (EMCON) and stealth. Naval TACAN operations are designed so an aircraft can find the ship and land. Since there is no encryption, an enemy can use the range and bearing provided to attack a ship equipped with a TACAN. Some TACANs have the ability to employ a &quot;Demand Only&quot; mode: only transmitting when interrogated by an aircraft on-channel. It is likely that TACAN will be replaced with a differential GPS system similar to the Local Area Augmentation System called JPALS. The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System has a low probability of intercept to prevent enemy detection and an aircraft carrier version can be used for autoland operations.

Some systems used in the United States modulate the transmitted signal by using a 900 RPM rotating antenna. Since this antenna is fairly large and must rotate 24 hours a day, possibly causing reliability issues. Modern systems have antennas that use electronic rotation (instead of mechanical rotation), hence no moving parts.

<text>&quot;Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes&quot; is the ninth episode of the eighth season of the American animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;, and the 120th episode of the series overall. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 3, 2004. In the episode, a &quot;Wall-Mart&quot; supermarket (used as a stand-in for Walmart) is built in South Park, and the people start to get addicted to shopping from it, due to its irresistibly attractive bargains, thus leading many businesses in South Park to close down. The four boys have to fight against Wall-Mart and to find a way to stop it from taking over the entire town.

The plot of this episode is a direct parody of the 1983 Disney movie &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; based on the 1962 novel by Ray Bradbury.

==Plot==
The episode begins with Cartman betting Kyle five dollars that when people die they &quot;crap their pants&quot;, which Kyle rebuffs. Meanwhile, a Wall-Mart opens in South Park to much fanfare, and everyone in town starts shopping there. The popularity of Wall-Mart forces the local businesses to shut down, including Jim&#x27;s Drugs. Local residents soon begin working at Wall-Mart for minimum wage and an extra 10% employee discount.

South Park turns into a ghost town, and the townspeople decide they no longer want to live with the Wall-Mart in their community. However they quickly fail to resist, starting to miss the bargains, so they (as a mob) ask the Wall-Mart manager to have the location closed down. Terrified, he asks them to meet him outside in five minutes. As the people stop outside his office, the manager throws himself through the window in an apparent suicide by hanging and then voids his bowels. Cartman joyfully tells Kyle that he owes him $5.

The townspeople burn the building down, only to later see it being rebuilt. A worker tells Kenny, Kyle, and Stan that Wall-Mart&#x27;s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas ordered the rebuilding. Stan and his friends arrange a bus trip to Bentonville to stop the company but are joined by Cartman, who the Wall-Mart subliminally ordered to stop them. Though none of the boys trust him (and Kyle knows firsthand that Cartman is secretly against them), they are in a hurry to leave. They reach Bentonville, despite Cartman&#x27;s attempts at sabotage, and talk to Harvey Brown, the president of Wall-Mart, who is ashamed of the damage caused by the company. The boys ask him how they can stop it, and he tells them they need to find and destroy its &quot;heart&quot;. As the boys leave, Brown, aware of his creating what he hated most, asks the boys to tell the world &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot; and commits suicide by shooting himself in the head, despite Stan pleading with him not to, and voids his bowels afterwards. Cartman laughs and declares that Kyle now owes him $10.

The kids return home to the still-dilapidated South Park. Dressed in camouflage, they try to re-enter their town&#x27;s Wall-Mart, but Cartman confronts them. Kyle angrily yells that he knew Cartman was against them all along. Kenny is then assigned to hold Cartman off while Stan and Kyle enter the Wall-Mart. In the television department, the boys are confronted by a man who says he is Wall-Mart. He tells the boys that the heart &quot;lies beyond that plasma screen television&quot;. The boys walk over to find a small mirror. Ignoring the metaphor that the true heart of Wall-Mart is individual consumerism, they simply destroy it instead. The building begins to shake, and the Wall-Mart begins to fall apart, while the man says they will see him in his &quot;true form&quot;. However, he does no more than rip off his mustache and jump around. The boys and everybody inside the Wall-Mart evacuate and gather with other townsfolk in the parking lot, and watch the Wall-Mart fold in on itself in a blinding flash of light, and then void its bowels (shown as the imploding building suddenly releasing a large amount of fecal matter before disappearing), causing Cartman to laugh, meaning that Kyle now owes him $15, but not telling him.

Everyone cheers because Kyle tells everyone that all Wall-Marts have a self-destruct sequence if they break a mirror in the back. Randy then explains that the residents of South Park had allowed their consumerism to work against them, nearly destroying their small town&#x27;s charm in the process. Realizing this, the townspeople return to shopping at Jim&#x27;s Drugs, which is shown to gradually grow larger until it becomes as large as Wall-Mart and is later burned down itself. Watching it burn, the townspeople vow against shopping there again, immediately heading to the local True Value, no doubt to repeat their past mistakes.

<text>Antaboga (; ; ; ), or colloquially also known as the Javan Dragon Snake deity is a serpent deity in Javanism and Sundanism (later also adopted in Balinese Hinduism). 

==Nomenclature==
 is a Javanese-origin name, derived or inherited from in Old Javanese. According to the Balinese literatures, the term might possibly rooted from two Sanskrit words, namely (अनन्त, ) and (भोग, ).

==Mythology==

At the beginning of time, only Antaboga existed. Antaboga meditated and created the world turtle named Bedawang from which all other creations sprang. In Javanese and Balinese mythology, Antaboga has two offsprings, a male named Bambang Naga Tatmala and a female one named Dewi Nagagini.

According to Sundanese myth, Antaboga was also responsible for the birth of Dewi Sri, the rice goddess of Java and Bali. According to &quot;Wawacan Sulanjana&quot;, Dewi Sri emerges from the tears that turned into an egg, shed by Antaboga.

These days many of the old myths and legends are celebrated in the wayang performance that became a vehicle to combine the syncretic philosophies from outside with those philosophies and ideas already rooted within the local cultures and traditions.

==Depictions==
In Javanese art, Antaboga is often depicted as a crowned serpent. As a divine serpent symbolism, it is applied into ornaments and decorative carvings. Generally it will appear on gong decorations as a symbol of the Javanese dragon. Artefacts of ancient objects are also generally decorated with Javanese dragon figures, such as keris, temple doors, stairs railings and other Javanese ornaments.

Antaboga is possibly derived from the actual native Javan dragon snake (&quot;Xenodermus javanicus&quot;), originally and traditionally venerated in Javanism folk religious belief, widely practiced by the local Javanese since pre-Islamic era (before the Islamization of Demak Kingdom, which later transformed as Demak Sultanate).

<text>Gemma Frisius (; born Jemme Reinerszoon; December 9, 1508 – May 25, 1555) was a Dutch physician, mathematician, cartographer, philosopher, and instrument maker. He created important globes, improved the mathematical instruments of his day and applied mathematics in new ways to surveying and navigation. Gemma&#x27;s rings, an astronomical instrument, are named after him. Along with Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, Frisius is often considered one of the founders of the Netherlandish school of cartography, and significantly helped lay the foundations for the school&#x27;s golden age (approximately 1570s–1670s).

==Biography==
Frisius was born in Dokkum, Friesland (present-day Netherlands), of poor parents who died when he was young. He moved to Groningen and later studied at the University of Leuven (Louvain), Belgium, beginning in 1525. He received the degree of MD in 1536 and remained on the faculty of medicine of Leuven for the rest of his life where, in addition to teaching medicine, he also taught mathematics, astronomy and geography. His oldest son, Cornelius Gemma, edited a posthumous volume of his work and continued to work with Ptolemaic astronomical models.
One of his most influential teachers at Leuven was Franciscus Monachus who, circa 1527, had constructed a famous globe in collaboration with the Leuven goldsmith Gaspar van der Heyden Under the guidance of Monachus and the technical assistance of Van der Heyden, Frisius set up a workshop to produce globes and mathematical instruments which were praised for their quality and accuracy by contemporary astronomers such as Tycho Brahe. Of particular fame were the terrestrial globe of 1536 and the celestial globe of 1537. On the first of these Frisius is described as the author with technical assistance from Van der Heyden and engraving by Gerardus Mercator who was a pupil of Frisius at the time. On the second globe Mercator is promoted to co-author.
In 1533, he described for the first time the method of triangulation still used today in surveying (see diagram). Having established a baseline, e.g., in this case, the cities of Brussels and Antwerp, the location of other cities, e.g. Middelburg, Ghent etc., can be found by taking a compass direction from each end of the baseline, and plotting where the two directions cross. This was only a theoretical presentation of the concept — due to topographical restrictions, it is impossible to see Middelburg from either Brussels or Antwerp. Nevertheless, the figure soon became well known all across Europe.

Twenty years later, in about 1553, he was the first to describe how an accurate clock could be used to determine longitude. Jean-Baptiste Morin (1583–1656) did not believe that Frisius&#x27; method for calculating longitude would work, remarking, &quot;I do not know if the Devil will succeed in making a longitude timekeeper but it is folly for man to try.&quot; It took two centuries before John Harrison produced a sufficiently accurate clock.
Frisius created or improved many instruments, including the cross-staff, the astrolabe, and the astronomical rings (also known as &quot;Gemma&#x27;s rings&quot;). His students included Gerardus Mercator (who became his collaborator), Johannes Stadius, John Dee, Andreas Vesalius and Rembert Dodoens.

Frisius died in Leuven at the age of 46. According to an account by his son, Cornelius, Gemma died from kidney stones, which he had suffered from for a minimum of 7 years.

A lunar crater has been named after him. Gualterus Arsenius, the 16th-century scientific instrument maker, was his nephew.

<text>Balinese mythology is the traditional mythology of the people of the Indonesian island of Bali, before the majority adoption of Hinduism.

Balinese mythology is mainly a kind of animism with some widely known characters and deities. Many themes of Balinese mythology have been adapted and worked into current Balinese Hinduism.

==Aspects of Balinese mythology==
*Antaboga
*Bedawang Nala
*Barong
*Bhoma - known as the Son of the Earth
*Rangda - a wicked witch and practitioner of black magic
*Setesuyara
*Batara Kala
*Semara
*Tjak
*Takshaka
*The Awan
*Perfumed Heaven
*Galungan
*Calon Arang
*Leyak (or Leák)
*Vasuki - the serpent king that accompanies Shiva

==Creation myth==
At the beginning of time, only Antaboga the world snake existed. Antaboga meditated and created the world turtle Bedawang. Two snakes lie on top of the world turtle, as does the Black Stone, which forms the lid of the underworld. The underworld is ruled by the goddess Setesuyara and the god Batara Kala, who created light and the earth. Above the earth lies a series of skies. Semara, god of love, lives in the floating sky, and above the sky lies the dark blue sky (space), home to the sun and moon. Next is the perfumed sky, which has many beautiful flowers and is inhabited by Tjak, a bird with a human face; the serpent Taksaka; and a group of snakes collectively known as the Awan, who appear as falling stars. The ancestors live in a flame-filled heaven above the perfumed heaven, and finally beyond that is the abode of the gods.

<doc id="1127334" wikidata="Q7886570" url="?curid=1127334" title="Union of Democratic Mineworkers">
<text>The Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM) was a British trade union for coal miners based in Nottinghamshire, England, established in 1985, following the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike, when the Nottinghamshire Area of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) was involved in a number of disputes with the National Executive Committee that led to a split from the NUM. In ballots on joining with Nottinghamshire in a new union, the South Derbyshire Area of the NUM voted in favour by 51% and the Colliery Workers and Allied Trades Association by almost 100%.

The Nottinghamshire Miners&#x27; Association initially remained within the National Union of Mineworkers with elected officers including Roy Lynk and Neil Greatrex, later the General Secretary of the UDM. Officials from the UDM advised ministers on how to cut miners&#x27; power – including by weakening the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS).

For many NUM supporters and Arthur Scargill loyalists, the UDM was and remains considered a &quot;scab&quot; union due their split for the NUM, return to work and cooperation with the Thatcher government.

The UDM was widely criticised in 2004 after it was revealed that its top two officials received pay and benefits of over £150,000 each, despite membership having fallen to 1,431. In 2012, former president Neil Greatrex was found guilty of fraud from a miners&#x27; welfare fund.

<doc id="1127338" wikidata="Q5471628" url="?curid=1127338" title="Fort McIntosh, Texas">
<text>Fort McIntosh was a U.S. Army base in Laredo, Webb County, Texas, from 1849 to 1946.

Fort McIntosh was established on 3 March 1849 by the 1st US Infantry, under the command of Lt. E.L. Viele, to guard the Texas frontier at the site of a strategic river crossing. Originally named Camp Crawford, the fort was renamed Fort McIntosh in 1850 in honor of Lieutenant Colonel James Simmons McIntosh, a hero in the Battle of Molino del Rey during the Mexican–American War.

The fort was abandoned by Federal troops at the outbreak of the American Civil War. The Battle of Laredo took place near the fort on March 19, 1864, when 72 men repelled three attacks from a force of 200 federal soldiers sent from Brownsville, Texas. On October 23, 1865, the post was reoccupied by federal troops of the 2nd Texas Cavalry.

In the late 19th century, several African-American units among them the 10th Cavalry, the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;, were stationed at Fort McIntosh. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Davis, Bliss, McKavett, Clark, Richardson, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma. Thesystem had &quot;subposts or intermediate stations&quot; including Bothwick&#x27;s Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.

During World War I, the fort was used as a training base, and had over 15,000 recruits pass
through the gates. During World War II, the 8th Service Command, the 56th Cavalry Brigade, the Southern Land Frontier, the Civil Air Patrol, and battalion of military police all were stationed at the facility at one time or another.

The fort was deactivated in 1946, and the land is now part of the campus of Laredo Community College main campus.

The Laredo United States Army Reserve 340th Quarter Master Company is located within the fort.

==National Register of Historic Places==
The National Register of Historic Places added Fort McIntosh (#75002011) to its registered historic districts in 1975. Its areas of historic significance are its 1850-1924 Late Victorian Architecture and Military background. All of Fort McIntosh buildings have been preserved and remodeled, and today they serve as educational buildings for Laredo Community College. The former officers barracks has been renovated into Arechiga Hall, named for the third LCC president, Domingo Arechiga.

<doc id="1127349" wikidata="Q3078112" url="?curid=1127349" title="Hot and high">
<text>In aviation, hot and high is a condition of low air density due to high ambient temperature and high airport elevation. Air density decreases with increasing temperature and altitude. The lower air density reduces the power output from an aircraft&#x27;s engine and also requires a higher true airspeed before the aircraft can become airborne. Aviators gauge air density by calculating the density altitude.

An airport may be especially hot &quot;or&quot; high, without the other condition being present. Temperature and pressure altitude can change from one hour to the next. The fact that temperature generally decreases as altitude increases mitigates the &quot;hot and high&quot; effect to a small extent.

==Negative effects of reduced engine power due to hot and high conditions==
* Airplanes require a longer takeoff run, potentially exceeding the amount of available runway.
* Reduced take-off power hampers an aircraft&#x27;s ability to climb. In some cases, an aircraft may be unable to climb rapidly enough to clear terrain surrounding a mountain airport.
* Helicopters may be forced to operate in the shaded portion of the height-velocity diagram in order to become airborne at all. This creates the potential for an uncontrollable descent in the event of an engine failure.
* In some cases, aircraft have landed at high-altitude airports by taking advantage of cold temperatures only to become stranded as temperatures warmed and air density decreased.
* While unsafe at any altitude, an overloaded aircraft is much more dangerous under hot and high conditions.

==Improving hot and high performance==
Some ways to increase aircraft performance in hot and high conditions include:
* Reduce aircraft weight. Weight can be reduced by carrying only enough fuel to reach the (lower-altitude) destination rather than filling the tanks completely. In some cases, unnecessary equipment can be removed from the aircraft. In many cases, however, the only practical way to adequately reduce aircraft weight is to depart with a smaller passenger, cargo, or weapons load. Consequently, hot and high conditions at the originating airport may prevent a commercial aircraft from operating with a load large enough to be profitable, or may constrain the firepower that a combat aircraft can bring to bear when conducting a long-range airstrike.
* Increase engine power. More powerful engines can improve an airplane&#x27;s acceleration and reduce its takeoff run. More powerful engines are generally larger and heavier and use more fuel during cruise, however, increasing the fuel load needed to reach the same destination. The added weight of the fuel and engines may negate the potential performance gain, and the added cost of the extra fuel may constrain the profitability of a commercial aircraft. On the other hand, replacing an older, less efficient engine with a newer engine of more advanced design can increase both power output and efficiency while sometimes even decreasing weight. In this situation, the only real disadvantage is the cost of the upgrade.
* Utilize assisted take off devices, such as rockets, to increase acceleration and rate of climb.
* Inject distilled water into the engine compressor or combustor. The primary purpose of water injection into jet engines is to increase the mass being accelerated, thereby increasing the force created by the engine. A secondary purpose is to lower the combustion temperature so that higher power settings may be used without causing engine temperatures to exceed limits.

==Jet- or rocket-assisted take off==

Auxiliary rockets and/or jet engines can help a fully loaded aircraft to take off within the length of the runway. The rockets are usually one-time units that are jettisoned after takeoff. This practice was common in the 1950s and 60s, when the lower levels of thrust from military turbojets was inadequate for takeoff from shorter runways or with very heavy payloads. It is now seldom used.

Auxiliary jets and rockets have rarely been used on civil aircraft due to the risk of aircraft damage and loss of control if something were to go wrong during their use. Boeing did, however, produce a version of its popular Boeing 727 with JATO primarily for &quot;hot and high&quot; operations out of Mexico City Airport (MMMX) and La Paz, Bolivia. The boosters were located adjacent to the main landing gear at the wing root on each side of the aircraft and only intended to operate as an emergency fallback in the case of an engine failure during takeoff.

==Specialized aircraft==
Several manufacturers of early jet airliners offered variants optimized for hot and high operations. Such aircraft generally offered the largest wings and/or the most powerful engines in the model lineup coupled with a small fuselage to reduce weight. Some such aircraft include:

* The BAC One-Eleven 475 combined the short body of the series 400 with the more powerful engines and improved wings of the series 500. This aircraft also featured stronger landing gear for rough field operations.
* The Boeing 707-220, which was a 707-120 airframe fitted with more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A engines, civilian versions of the military J75. The 707-220 had extremely high fuel consumption, and only 5 were built, all for Braniff International Airways. The 707-220 was rendered redundant by the release of the turbofan-powered 707-120B, which had even greater power along with much lower fuel consumption.
*The Convair 880. Although Convair offered only one configuration of this aircraft, it had more power and a smaller fuselage than its competitors from Boeing and Douglas. Convair essentially wagered the success of the entire 880 model line on the appeal of an aircraft optimized for hot and high operations. The wager failed; only sixty-five 880s were sold and Convair&#x27;s nascent airliner business soon collapsed.
*The De Havilland Canada Dash 8-200, which is a -100 airframe fitted with larger engines of the -300 for hot and high operations. They proved successful and eventually replaced the -100 production line. 
* The Lockheed L-1011-200, which was otherwise an L-1011-100 with more powerful RB.211-524B engines.
* The McDonnell Douglas DC-9-20, which combined the smaller fuselage of the DC-9-10 with the larger wings and more powerful engines of the DC-9-30, and was significantly outsold by both.
* The McDonnell Douglas DC-10-15, which combined the fuselage of the DC-10-10 with the larger engines of the DC-10-30. These were specifically designed for and sold to Aeromexico and Mexicana. Only seven were built.
* The Vickers VC10, which was designed to meet BOAC requirements for a large airliner that could operate medium-range flights from short runways in southern Asia and Africa. The rear-mounted engines gave a more efficient wing and made them less vulnerable to runway debris. The resulting high fuel consumption compared to the contemporary Boeing 707 prompted all other major airlines to dismiss the VC10.
* The McDonnell Douglas MD-82 was a hot and high version of the MD-80, and sold well, which generally is extremely rare for a type of performance-specialised aircraft

The marketing failure of most of these airplanes demonstrated that airlines were generally unwilling to accept reduced efficiency at cruise and smaller ultimate load-carrying capacity in return for a slight performance gain at particular airports. Rather than accepting these drawbacks, it was easier for airlines to demand the construction of longer runways, operate with smaller loads as conditions dictated, or simply drop the unprofitable destinations.

Furthermore, as the second generation of jet airliners began to appear in the 1970s, some aircraft were designed to eliminate the need for a special &quot;hot and high&quot; variant – for instance, the Airbus A300 can perform a 15/0 takeoff, where the leading edge slats are adjusted to 15 degrees and the flaps kept retracted. This takeoff technique is only used at hot and high airports, for it enables a higher climb limit weight and improves second segment climb performance.

Most jetliner manufacturers have dropped the &quot;hot and high&quot; variants from their model lineups.

<text>Fort McIntosh is an American military fortification from the American Revolution located near the Satilla River in Brantley County, Georgia, near the present site of the intersection of U.S. Route 82 and Georgia State Route 110 near the town of Atkinson, Georgia.

The log fortress was constructed by William McIntosh, brother of Colonel Lachlan McIntosh, to guard the Georgia frontier against attacks by Tory sympathizing Floridians and hostile Native American tribes.

The fort was a square log and earth structure about 100 feet on each side with a bastion
at each corner. The fort was garrisoned by 40 men from the 3rd South Carolina Regiment and
20 Continentals from the 1st Brigade Georgia Militia, under command of Captain Richard Winn.

On February 17, 1777, the base was attacked by Tories and Indians and forced to surrender the next day. All of the prisoners were released with the exception of two officers who were taken as hostages to St. Augustine, Florida. One of the officers taken to St. Augustine was Lieutenant Daniel McDuff of the 3rd Spartan Regiment.

<text>Chamaecyparis pisifera (Sawara cypress or Sawara ) is a species of false cypress, native to central and southern Japan, on the islands of Honshū and Kyūshū.

==Description==
It is a slow-growing coniferous tree growing to 35–50 m tall with a trunk up to 2 m in diameter. The bark is red-brown, vertically fissured and with a stringy texture. The foliage is arranged in flat sprays; adult leaves are scale-like, 1.5–2 mm long, with pointed tips (unlike the blunt tips of the leaves of the related &quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot; (hinoki cypress), green above, green below with a white stomatal band at the base of each scale-leaf; they are arranged in opposite decussate pairs on the shoots. The juvenile leaves, found on young seedlings, are needle-like, 4–8 mm long, soft and glaucous bluish-green. The cones are globose, 4–8 mm diameter, with 6–10 scales arranged in opposite pairs, maturing in autumn about 7–8 months after pollination.

===Related species===
A related cypress found on Taiwan, &quot;Chamaecyparis formosensis&quot; (Formosan cypress), differs in longer ovoid cones 6–10 mm long with 10–16 scales. The extinct Eocene species &quot;Chamaecyparis eureka&quot;, known from fossils found on Axel Heiberg Island in Canada, is noted to be very similar to &quot;C. pisifera&quot;.

==Name==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;pisifera&quot;, &quot;pea-bearing&quot;, refers to the small round green cones.

==Uses==
===Timber===
It is grown for its timber in Japan, where it is used as a material for building palaces, temples, shrines and baths, and making coffins, though less valued than the timber of &quot;C. obtusa&quot;. The wood is lemon-scented and light-colored with a rich, straight grain, and is rot resistant.

===Ornamental===
It is also a popular ornamental tree in parks and gardens, both in Japan and elsewhere in temperate climates including western and central Europe and parts of North America. A large number of cultivars have been selected for garden planting, including dwarf forms, forms with yellow or blue-green leaves, and forms retaining the juvenile needle-like foliage; particularly popular juvenile foliage cultivars include &#x27;Plumosa&#x27;, &#x27;Squarrosa&#x27; and &#x27;Boulevard&#x27;.

In cultivation in the UK the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017): 
* &#x27;Boulevard&#x27;: , blue-green foliage
* &#x27;Filifera Aurea&#x27;: rounded, needle-like golden foliage, to 
* &#x27;Plumosa Compressa&#x27;: dwarf to , soft mossy foliage on young plants
* &#x27;Sungold&#x27;: rounded shrub to tall and wide, with needle-like lime green foliage

<text>The Vitim (; , ; , ; Buryat and , &quot;Vitim&quot;) is a major tributary of the Lena. Its source is east of Lake Baikal, at the confluence of rivers Vitimkan from the west and China from the east. The Vitim flows first south, bends eastwards and then northward in the Vitim Plateau. Then it flows north through the Stanovoy Highlands and the town of Bodaybo.
Including river Vitimkan, its western source, it is long, and has a drainage basin of . 

It is navigable from the Lena to Bodaybo. Upstream, tugs can haul barges as far as the Baikal Amur Mainline (BAM), but this is becoming rare. 

The Vitim is an excellent place for adventure rafting, but is rarely visited because of its isolation. Baissa, one of the famous localities of fossil insects is situated on the left bank of the Vitim River.

==History==
The first Russian to explore the river was probably Maksim Perfilyev in 1639–40, who brought back reports of the upper Amur River.
Formerly, because of its swift current, goods were hauled overland from Chita to Romanovka. There boats were built, floated down the river, and broken up at their destination. This lasted until the late 1940s.
===Vitim impact event===
The Vitim event occurred in the Vitim River basin near Bodaybo on 25 September 2002. The event was probably caused by a bolide. The event was similar to Tagish Lake.

==Course==

Going upstream: Vitim town where the Vitim joins the Lena. Mama and Mama Airport, about south of Vitim. A muscovite mica mine from 1705 until the late 1930s. Now a small settlement. Mamakan, on a west-flowing stretch south-southeast of Vitim. In 1963 a 86MW dam on the Mamakan River was completed, one of the first dams built on permafrost. Bodaybo, just upstream, a gold mining center founded in 1864. Upstream, the port of Luzhki was the start of a road to the Lena gold fields. From here upstream the river goes crookedly east and then south. About upstream from Bodaybo are the Delyun-Uran Rapids and after more, the Parama Rapids. About or so upstream, the Vitim is crossed by the Baikal Amur Mainline between Taksimo and Kuanda. Upriver there are more rapids and goldfields. South through the Stanovoy Mountains toward Chita, then west into the Vitim Plateau east of Lake Baikal. The river peaks in June and freezes from November to May.

===Tributaries===

The main tributaries of the Vitim are, from source to mouth:

<text>Vitória Sport Clube, popularly known as Vitória de Guimarães, is a Portuguese professional football club based in Guimarães that competes in the Primeira Liga, the top flight of Portuguese football at the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques. The club also stands out on the national and international scene in sports such as athletics, volleyball, basketball, handball, water polo, swimming, jiu-jitsu, taekwondo and kickboxing, among others.

It is currently the 4th club with the most appearances, totalling 80, in the top level of the sport in Portugal. It is also the 4th club with the most members, with over 36,000 members. 

Vitória de Guimarães have finished third in the Primeira Liga on four occasions, most recently in 2007–08. They have won one Taça de Portugal in 2012–13 and one Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira in 1988, while also being runners-up of the former on six occasions.

The club have competed regularly in European competitions, where their best finish was the quarter-finals of the 1986–87 UEFA Cup.

Vitória SC have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club SC Braga, with whom they contest the Minho derby. In addition to this age-old rivalry, Vitória has another major dispute with Boavista FC from the city of Porto.

==History==

=== The origins of Vitória Sport Clube (1913–1922) ===
Vitória Sport Clube owes its origins to a group of young students who set up a football team, made up of two teams, the 1st team being Sport Club Vimaranense and the 2nd team being Foot-ball Grupo Vimaranense, in 1913, a date that some researchers point to as the true founding date of the club, which in 1918 was given its current name.

The club was founded on 22 September 1922, the official date of its foundation, the club set up its first board of directors after one of the Victorian gatherings that took place at the Chapelaria Macedo and was affiliated to the Braga Football Association in its first year of operation.

=== 20th century (1922–2000) ===
Vitória&#x27;s first emblem was created by Capitão Mário Cardoso in the late 1920s and depicts Afonso Henriques, the first King of Portugal, a symbol that inspires a club of conquerors, of fearless men who courageously fight for their goals.

After seasons of hard work, which culminated in winning several titles in Braga&#x27;s AF league, the Conquistadores were promoted to the Primeira Liga in 1941, and two seasons later battled the &quot;Sadinos&quot; from Setúbal for the first time in the League. Against the odds, he reached his first Portuguese Cup final in their debut season, but lost to Belenenses 2–0.

Throughout the 20th century, Vitória Sport Clube was a possible contender to win the Portuguese Cup, reaching the final in 1942, 1963, 1976 and 1988. However, they were always defeated and avoided winning their first national trophy.

In 1980, Pimenta Machado took over the leadership of the club and since then, Vitória has been one of the leading clubs in Portuguese football, participating several times in European competitions.

Vitória&#x27;s furthest progress in a European tournament was in the 1986–87 UEFA Cup, in which they were defeated 5–2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals by West German club Borussia Mönchengladbach.

Finally, in 1988, Vitória won its first national trophy, winning the Super Cup as finalists in the Portuguese Cup against FC Porto 2–0 (aggregate result).

=== New millennium (2001–present) ===
In the early 2000s, Vitória struggled in some years to retain its status in the top Portuguese division, then named the Superliga. Those years were marked by the decline of the leadership of Pimenta Machado, former club president, who was accused on charges of embezzlement. In February 2008 he was sentenced to four years and three months of prison on a suspended sentence, though a year later he was cleared of this charge and instead ordered to pay a €4,000 fine for falsifying a document.

Despite this, in 2004–05, the club secured a fifth-place finish in the league and qualified for European competition via the UEFA Cup. The next season (2005–06), however, they were relegated to the Segunda Liga (where they last played in 1958) after finishing 17th in the Superliga, despite reaching the Taça de Portugal semi-final, having beaten Benfica in the quarter-finals. The club also failed to progress from their UEFA Cup group, as eventual winners Sevilla, Premier League outfit Bolton Wanderers and Russian team Zenit Saint Petersburg progressed.

Vitória bounced back immediately to the top-flight as runners-up to Leixões S.C. under the management of Manuel Cajuda. A joint-best third-place finish in 2007–08, guaranteeing them a place in the third qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, their first such campaign. There they fell to Swiss side FC Basel 2–1 on aggregate, with a potential away goal winner by Roberto Calmon Félix being ruled out late on for offside, despite being a bad call from the referee. Vitória dropped into the 2008–09 UEFA Cup first round as a result of their elimination, and lost 4–2 on aggregate after extra time to England&#x27;s Portsmouth.

Led by Rui Vitória in 2012–13, Vitória found themselves in financial problems, which caused them to lose many experienced players and bet on young players. However, they would go on to win their first Taça de Portugal title after previously losing five finals. Vitória beat rivals Braga en route to the final, where they recovered from 1–0 down against Benfica to win 2–1.

In 2017, Vitória made the cup final again, losing 2–1 to double winners S.L. Benfica. That September, the team left their mark in UEFA competitions, being the first team to start a game without a European player on the field. In 2020–21, the club went through four managers – Tiago, João Henriques, Bino and Moreno – before finishing seventh, missing Europe by one place.

=== Centenary of Vitória SC (2022) ===
In the run-up to the club&#x27;s centenary, the «Vitória Sport Clube 1922-2022» exhibition was held, retracing 100 years of the popular emblem from the city of Guimarães. This way, we can photographically remember many of the club&#x27;s most emblematic players, as well as images of the oldest pitches.

Third time&#x27;s the charm! After two consecutive seasons of being eliminated in the qualifying round, Vitória finally managed, in the 2024–25 season, to successfully pass the qualifying rounds and enter the new regular phase of the Conference League called the league phase, becoming the first Portuguese club to achieve this feat. At the helm of Rui Borges side, the Conquistadores had 6 wins and a goal aggregate of 17–0. In addition to this feat, the Vimaranense club achieved the unprecedented record of 9 consecutive wins by a Portuguese club in UEFA competitions. This record was set after a 2–1 home win against FK Mladá Boleslav.

== Sociedad anónima deportiva (SAD) ==
In February 2023, Vitória announced an agreement to sell 46% of the club&#x27;s shares in a deal worth €5m to football club holding company V Sports, led by billionaires Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens: owners of Premier League club Aston Villa. V Sports would additionally offer a credit line of up to €20m, and invest an additional €2m into sporting infrastructure. The agreement was approved at a vote of Vitória&#x27;s members on 4 March 2023: approximately 88% voted in favour of the deal. However, due to UEFA rules, VSports participation had to be reduced to 29%.

President of the Board of Directors

== Sports venues ==
=== D. Afonso Henriques Stadium ===

They play in the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques, which has a capacity of just over 30,029. After &quot;The Big Three&quot;, Vitória is the club which attracts most supporters to the stadium, with average attendances close to 20,000 per game. Vitória usually has a higher average than all the other clubs, even when the club played in the Second League in 2006/07.

=== Other Infrastructures ===

==== Vitória SC Sports Complex ====
It was opened in 1997 under the name &quot;Complexo Desportivo Dr. Alberto Pimenta Machado&quot;, when the club had Dr. Alberto Pimenta Machado himself as president. The idea came up when, at the time, the president visited Milanello, AC Milan&#x27;s sports complex.

The Sports Complex hosts the club&#x27;s administrative services, the training of the senior football team and the training and games of the club&#x27;s youth teams. It includes 3 natural grass fields, 3 synthetic fields (one of them for Football 7), a gym, two dozen changing rooms, a mini stadium and a sports hall, where the club&#x27;s teams train and play.

==== Vitória SC Mini Stadium ====
Occupying Field 5 of the Victorian Academy and with capacity for 2,500 spectators, the home of the B team and the under-19s will appear. It will also have a presidential tribune, three bars, six changing rooms and a technical support area.

==== Vimaranense Unit Sports Pavilion ====
Inserted in the Sports Complex, the Pavilion, opened in 1997 with capacity for 2,500 spectators, is the home of Vitória SC sports, where it hosts around 600 athletes weekly between training and competitions. From the 2022/23 season to 2023/24, there was a 40 per cent increase in the average number of spectators per game. This infrastructure was therefore remodelled in the summer of 2024 in order to provide even better working and entertainment conditions for all members.

==== Guimarães Sports City ====
The Sports City is made up of a set of equipment existing in the municipality of Guimarães intended for sports and allows the reception of major events of national and international dimensions. These facilities, such as the swimming pool complex and the athletics track, are frequently used by athletes and teams from Vitória SC&#x27;s training and modalities.

== Rivalries ==

=== Rivalry with SC Braga ===
The Minho derby is the football rivalry between Sporting Clube de Braga and Vitória Sport Clube, two of the biggest clubs in the Minho region of northern Portugal. This derby is marked by great tension and passion, reflecting not only sporting competition, but also a historical and cultural rivalry between the cities of Braga and Guimarães that began even before the formation of the Kingdom of Portugal. Since then it has been a struggle in all aspects of society, sport, culture, the economy... Football has only become a means used to transpose the rivalry. Considered to be one of the most exciting and fiercely contested matches in Portuguese football, the Dérbi Minhoto is eagerly awaited by the fans, who live intensely for the clash between these two cities traditionally known for their history and identity.

=== Rivalry with Boavista FC ===
The Conquistadores versus Panteras match against Boavista Futebol Clube is a regional contest involving the city of Guimarães and the city of Porto. Although it&#x27;s not as famous as other rivalries, it&#x27;s marked by tension between Vitorianos and Axadrezados fans, with each club representing the pride of its city and region. The clash is always eagerly awaited, given the great competitive history and geographical proximity between the two teams.

=== Other rivalries ===
There is also a certain rivalry between Braga, Boavista, Belenenses and Vitória SC, due to the closeness in the number of titles and because they are some of the clubs with the largest number of fans in Portugal, with many people creating arguments to determine which would be the &quot;4th big&quot;. However, the distance between these clubs and the Big Three is considerable enough in any sport to be given such a designation.

==Honours==
==League and Cup history==
Updated: November 2023.
The club&#x27;s 79 seasons (as in 2023) in the top level of Portuguese football make them the club with the joint-fourth longest time there, after Benfica, Porto, and Sporting CP (all with 90).

<text>The Olenyok (, sometimes spelled &quot;Оленек&quot;, &quot;Olenek&quot;; , Ölöön) is a major river in northern Siberian Russia, west of the lower Lena and east of the Anabar. It is long, of which around is navigable. Average water discharge is .

The Olenyok is known for its abundance in fish. It is frozen for over eight months every year and the climate in its area is harsh because of the direct influence of the Arctic.

==History==
In 1633 Ivan Rebrov reached the Olenyok from the Lena delta and built a fort. In 1642–44 Rebrov and Fedot Alekseyev Popov reached the river but were driven out by the natives.

Pioneering Russian Arctic explorer Vasili Pronchishchev and his wife Tatiana (Maria) died of scurvy in the area of the river in September 1736, while mapping the coasts of the Laptev Sea. After their deaths, husband and wife were interred at Ust-Olenyok, near the mouth of the Olenyok. Their tomb was moved after the bodies were exhumed in 1999.

In 1956 the Olenekian Age of the Triassic Period of geological time was named for rock strata in the Olenyok area.

==Course==
The river&#x27;s source is in Krasnoyarsk Krai, on the Vilyuy Plateau, part of the Central Siberian Plateau. The river flows east and then north descending into the North Siberian Lowland. In its lower course it bends northwestwards skirting the western slopes of the Kystyk Plateau and the Chekanovsky Ridge before emptying into the Olenyok Gulf of the Laptev Sea. Its mouth is at Ust-Olenyok just west of the Lena River delta. Olenyok is a village located on the river bank.

===Tributaries===
The major tributaries of the Olenyok are the Arga-Sala (with its tributaries Kengeede, Kukusunda and Kyuyonelekeen), Bur, Ukukit, Birekte, Kuoika, Beyenchime and Buolkalakh on the left, and the Alakit, Siligir, Merchimden, Kyuyutingde (Кюютингдэ), Khorbusuonka and Kelimyar on the right.

===Islands===
Dyangylakh or Dzhyangylakh (Ostrov Dyangylakh) is a large flat delta island at the mouth of the Olenek River. There are many smaller islands in its immediate vicinity, such as Eppet Island off its eastern side, but none comes close to its size. Dyangylakh is long and wide.

<doc id="1127393" wikidata="Q317188" url="?curid=1127393" title="Theo van Gogh (art dealer)">
<text>Theodorus van Gogh (; 1 May 1857 – 25 January 1891) was a Dutch art dealer and the younger brother of Vincent van Gogh. Known as Theo, his support of his older brother&#x27;s artistic ambitions and well-being allowed Vincent to devote himself entirely to painting. As an art dealer, Theo van Gogh played a crucial role in introducing contemporary French art to the public. 

Theo died at the age of 33, six months after his brother&#x27;s death at age 37. Theo owned almost all of his brother&#x27;s artwork. Theo&#x27;s widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger worked to promote the work of Vincent and keep the memory of her husband alive. In 1914, Theo van Gogh&#x27;s remains were buried next to those of his brother Vincent. 

==Early life==
Theodorus &quot;Theo&quot; van Gogh was born on 1 May 1857 in the village of Groot-Zundert in the province of North Brabant, Netherlands.

He was the son of Theodorus van Gogh and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. His elder brother was artist Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890).

==Business career==

Theo worked for some years at the Dutch office of the Parisian art dealers Goupil &amp; Cie in The Hague. Theo joined the Brussels office on 1 January 1873 as their youngest employee. After Theo was transferred to the London office, he moved to the office in The Hague, where he became a successful art dealer. By 1884, he was transferred to the Paris main office, which in 1884 took the name of Boussod, Valadon &amp; Cie. Beginning in the winter of 1880–1881, he sent painting materials as well as monthly financial support to his brother Vincent, who was living in Belgium and soon moved to the Netherlands.

==Personal life==
In Paris, Theo met Andries Bonger and his sister Johanna, known as Jo. He was quite taken with her and hoped to marry her. At the time, she was in a relationship she hoped would lead to marriage. When it did not, she reconsidered Theo&#x27;s proposal. They married in Amsterdam on 17 April 1889. During their short engagement, they had an extensive correspondence, later published as &quot;Brief Happiness&quot;, in which they discussed practical matters of setting up married life together, but Theo also conveyed strength and the importance of his bond with Vincent. The couple moved to Paris, where their apartment became a venue for socializing with artists and members of the artistic community. Their son Vincent Willem was born in Paris on 31 January 1890. On 8 June, the family visited Vincent, who was living near Paris in Auvers-sur-Oise.

Vincent died in July 1890 at age 37. Theo suffered from dementia paralytica, now understood as late-stage neurosyphilis, and his health declined rapidly after Vincent&#x27;s death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent&#x27;s absence, he died six months later (25 January 1891) at age 33 in Den Dolder.

Theo&#x27;s great-grandson, also named Theo van Gogh, was a controversial film director, who was murdered on the streets of Amsterdam in 2004 by an Islamic extremist after making a short film critical of the treatment of women in Islamic culture.

==Relationship with Vincent==
Theo admired his elder brother Vincent for his whole life, but communicating with him proved to be difficult, even before Vincent became an artist. The communication between both brothers suffered from diverging definitions of standards, and it was evidently Theo who kept on writing letters. Vincent did not keep all the letters Theo sent, but Theo kept every scrap of correspondence from his brother (651 letters addressed to Theo in total). Most of Vincent&#x27;s replies survived but only 32 of Theo&#x27;s remain . Theo was often concerned about Vincent&#x27;s mental condition and he was amongst the few who understood his brother. It is known that Theo helped Vincent maintain his artist lifestyle by giving him money. He also helped Vincent pursue his life as an artist through his unwavering emotional support and love. The majority of Theo&#x27;s letters and communications with Vincent are filled with praise and encouragement. Vincent would send Theo sketches and ideas for paintings, along with accounts of his day-to-day experiences, to the delight and eager attention of Theo.

===Dealer and artist===
While Theo is best known for being the brother of Vincent van Gogh and one of his major roles in art was his influence on Vincent&#x27;s career, Theo himself made many important contributions. Theo played a vital role in the introduction of contemporary Dutch and French art to the public: Theo was instrumental in the popularity of Impressionist artists such as Claude Monet and Edgar Degas by persuading his employers, Goupil &amp; Cie, to exhibit and buy their works.
In 1886, Theo invited Vincent to live with him in Paris, and from March they shared an apartment in Montmartre. Theo introduced Vincent to Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri Rousseau, Camille Pissarro and Georges Seurat, and in 1888 he persuaded Gauguin to join Vincent, who had moved to Arles. Theo not only conspired with Vincent as the liaison between Vincent and Gauguin, but was the deciding factor in his move to Arles, seeing as it was Theo van Gogh who planned and eventually committed to supporting them both financially. Theo paid for their living and professional expenses, as well as for the travel expenses Gauguin accumulated to get from Pont-Aven, Brittany, to Arles. Theo was equally the one with whom Gauguin communicated when his relationship with Vincent turned volatile and unmanageable, notably the severing of the ear fiasco. Theo was the source of stability and the intermediate between the two artists and allowed them to create prolifically for a couple of months (63 days); paintings that would otherwise not have survived.

Competing with Paul Durand-Ruel and Georges Petit, the young dealer was to take over an important stake in this market. In 1888, he exhibited ten paintings by Claude Monet from Antibes. Theo also had close relations with Camille Pissarro, and in the autumn of 1888, he presented a few of the painter&#x27;s latest works, eventually devoting an exhibit to him in 1890. Edgar Degas allowed him to set up a small exhibition of his nudes in January 1888, and an exhibition of a selection of his works in 1889. Theo was also interested in Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and other &quot;moderns&quot; such as Paul-Albert Besnard, Eugène Carrière, and Jean-François Raffaëlli.

===Correspondence===

The two brothers maintained an intensive correspondence, with Theo often encouraging his depressed brother. Theo was one of the few people Vincent could talk to and confide in. These letters are one of the few sources of information about Vincent&#x27;s life, providing detailed accounts of not only the occurrences, but also the thoughts and feelings in his life. Over three-quarters of the more than 800 letters Vincent wrote were to Theo, including his first and his last.

It is largely thanks to Theo and his wife Johanna, who in 1914 decided to publish the letters between Theo and Vincent that the letters are available. Hardly any of Theo&#x27;s letters survive because Vincent failed to keep them. The two-year period in which Vincent and Theo lived together in the neighbourhood of Montmartre in Paris is also the least documented period of Vincent&#x27;s artistic career because of the lack of letters. These letters witness both the emotional and professional state of Vincent throughout his life as early as 1874 and serve as a diary for his everyday encounters. The letters have been collected and published in the book &quot;The Letters of Vincent van Gogh&quot;.

===Film legacy===
The Van Gogh brothers&#x27; relationship figured in the Vincente Minnelli 1956 movie adaptation of Irving Stone&#x27;s 1934 biographical novel &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. In it, Hollywood star Kirk Douglas played Vincent, and British actor James Donald appeared as Theo.

The family relationship was the more central subject in Robert Altman&#x27;s movie &quot;Vincent &amp; Theo&quot; (1990), starring British actors Tim Roth as Vincent and Paul Rhys as Theo.

The brothers&#x27; relationship is also featured in Maurice Pialat&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Van Gogh&quot;, with Jacques Dutronc playing Vincent and Bernard Le Coq as Theo.

The delivery of Vincent&#x27;s final letter to Theo after Vincent&#x27;s death, and the circumstances surrounding his death, was the subject of the 2017 film &quot;Loving Vincent&quot;, which was animated by oil paintings made with Van Gogh&#x27;s techniques.

Julian Schnabel&#x27;s meditation on Vincent&#x27;s artistic life, &quot;At Eternity&#x27;s Gate&quot; (2018), featured Willem Dafoe as Vincent and Rupert Friend as Theo.

==Death==

Theo&#x27;s health was not robust when he married. In fact, he had been denied a life insurance policy because of it. It deteriorated significantly in the months after the death of his brother. He was admitted to the Willem Arntz Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, in Den Dolder on 18 November 1890. He had been diagnosed in Paris as suffering from a progressive and general paralysis. Initial examination confirmed this diagnosis. By 1 December his medical notes confirmed he presented all the symptoms of &quot;dementia paralytica&quot;, a disease of the brain caused by syphilis. He died on 25 January 1891. The cause of death was listed as &quot;dementia paralytica&quot; caused by &quot;heredity, chronic disease, overwork, sadness&quot;. 

In 1914, Theo&#x27;s body was exhumed from his resting place in Utrecht, Netherlands, and reburied with his brother at Auvers-sur-Oise at the wish of his widow, Jo, so the brothers could &quot;lie together eternally&quot;. By doing that, she also guaranteed that those visiting the grave of the by now well known artist would be aware of Theo&#x27;s closeness to his older brother in life.

<text>Francisco Alejandro Pérez Martínez (11 May 1932 – 28 August 2007), better known as Francisco Umbral, was a Spanish journalist, novelist, biographer and essayist.

==Style==
Although he was born in Madrid, a city that has inspired most of his work, his early years were spent in Valladolid. His mother travelled to Madrid for his birth, because he was an illegitimate child. His mother&#x27;s indifference and distance from him left him with an enduring sadness, as did the death of his only son at the age of six, which caused him to write his saddest and most personal book, &quot;Mortal y rosa&quot; (&quot;A Mortal Spring&quot;). This fostered a characteristic bitter and stiff outlook in the author, devoid of hopefulness, absolutely submerged in literature, which has provoked many controversies and hostilities.

In Valladolid, he began his journalistic career at &quot;El Norte de Castilla&quot;, under the tutorship of Miguel Delibes. In 1961, he went to Madrid as a correspondent for said newspaper and quickly became a prestigious reporter and columnist in magazines such as &quot;La Estafeta Literaria&quot;, &quot;Mundo Hispánico&quot; and &quot;Interviú&quot;, and in influential newspapers such as &quot;Ya&quot; and &quot;ABC&quot;, although he is best known for his writings for the daily newspapers &quot;El País&quot; (founded in 1976 just after the death of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco and the restoration of constitutionalism and democracy) and &quot;El Mundo&quot; (founded 1990). 
At &quot;El País&quot;, he was one of the reporters who was best able to describe the countercultural movement known as &quot;La Movida&quot;, but his literary quality undoubtedly came from his creative fecundity, his linguistic sensibility and the extreme originality of his style: very careful and complex, creative in its syntax, very metaphorically developed and flexible, abundant in neologisms and intertextual allusions; in sum, of a demanding lyric and aesthetic quality. He exercised a type of anti-bourgeois criticism of customs and manners, without renouncing the most intensely romantic ego, and, in the words of Novalis, having the intent of giving the dignity of the unknown to everyday life, impregnating it with a desolate tenderness. As a political reporter, Umbral was a highly trenchant writer. Having become a successful journalist and writer, he worked with Spain&#x27;s most varied and influential magazines and newspapers. Among the many published volumes of his articles, the following stand out:
*&quot;Diario de un snob&quot; (&quot;Diary of a snob&quot;, 1973)
*&quot;Spleen de Madrid&quot; (&quot;Madrid Spleen&quot;, 1973, the title being a reference to Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Paris Spleen&quot;)
*&quot;España cañí&quot; (1975)
*&quot;Iba yo a comprar el pan&quot; (&quot;I went out to buy bread&quot;, 1976)
*&quot;Los políticos&quot; (&quot;Politicians&quot;, 1976)
*&quot;Crónicas postfranquistas&quot; (&quot;Post-Francoist Chronicles&quot;, 1976)
*&quot;Las Jais&quot; (&quot;Birds&quot;, &quot;Chicks&quot; [slang, i.e. &quot;Girls&quot;] 1977)
*&quot;Spleen de Madrid–2&quot; (&quot;Madrid Spleen–2&quot;, 1982)
*&quot;España como invento&quot; (&quot;Spain as an invention&quot;, 1984)
*&quot;La belleza convulsa&quot; (&quot;Convulsive Beauty&quot;, 1985)
*&quot;Memorias de un hijo del siglo&quot; (&quot;Memories of a child of the century&quot;, 1986)
*&quot;Mis placeres y mis días&quot; (&quot;My pleasures and my days&quot;, 1994).

Among non-readers, he is remembered by an appearance in Mercedes Milá&#x27;s TV program &quot;Queremos saber&quot; in Antena 3 TV (1993). After some conversation, Umbral interrupted the conversation claiming that he had come to talk about his then latest book, &quot;La década roja&quot;, not to entertain the presenter.

*&quot;Las señoritas de Aviñón&quot; (&quot;The Young Ladies of Avignon&quot;, 1995; the title is a reference to a painting by Pablo Picasso generally known in the English-speaking world by its French-language name, &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;)

*&quot;Historias de amor y Viagra&quot; (&quot;Stories of Love and Viagra&quot;, 1998)

In 1985, Umbral began a series of novels about the most important events in the history of twentieth-century Spain, after the fashion of the &quot;Episodios nacionales&quot; of Benito Pérez Galdós for the nineteenth century.

===Essays===
He also wrote a set of very personal essays, under such titles as:
*&quot;La escritura perpetua (De Rubén Darío a Cela)&quot; (&quot;Perpetual Writing (From Rubén Darío to Cela)&quot;, 1989)*
*&quot;Las palabras de la tribu&quot; (&quot;The Words of the Tribe&quot;, 1994)
*&quot;Diccionario de literatura&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of Literature&quot;, 1995)

*&quot;Los alucinados&quot; (&quot;Hallucinations&quot;, 2001)
*&quot;Cela: un cadáver exquisito&quot; (&quot;Cela, an Exquisite Corpse&quot;, 2002)
*&quot;¿Y cómo eran las ligas de Madame Bovary?&quot; (&quot;And What Were Madame Bovary&#x27;s Garters Like?&quot;, 2003).

His preoccupation with slang is shown by:
*&quot;Diccionario para pobres&quot; (&quot;Dictionary for the Poor&quot;, 1977)
*&quot;Diccionario cheli&quot; (&quot;&quot;Cheli&quot; Dictionary&quot;, 1983, &quot;Cheli&quot; being to Madrid what Cockney is to London)
*&quot;Las palabras de la tribu&quot; (&quot;The Words of the Tribe&quot;, 1994).

===Biographies and autobiographies===
He also published biographical and literary essays presenting original views about classical authors of the 19th and 20th centuries, such as:
*&quot;Larra, anatomía de un dandy&quot; (&quot;Larra, anatomy of a dandy&quot;, 1965)
*&quot;Lorca, poeta maldito&quot; (1968, about Federico García Lorca; the title is ambiguous, and could be interpreted as calling Lorca a &quot;wicked&quot;, or &quot;indecent&quot; poet or one who is &quot;cursed&quot; either in the sense of being &quot;spoken against&quot; or &quot;unlucky&quot;)
*&quot;Ramón y las vanguardias&quot; (&quot;Ramón and the vanguards&quot;, 1978) 
*&quot;Valle-Inclán: los botines blancos de piqué&quot; (&quot;Valle-Inclán: &quot;White &quot;Piqué&quot; Boots&quot;, 1997)

Other biographies are more revealing:
*&quot;Valle-Inclán&quot; (1968)
*&quot;Lord Byron&quot; (1969)
*&quot;Miguel Delibes&quot; (1970)
*&quot;Lola Flores, sociología de la petenera&quot; (&quot;Lola Flores, sociology of the &quot;petenera&quot;&quot;, 1971).

Although autobiography is also present throughout his journalistic work, several of his works are explicitly autobiographical:
*&quot;La noche que llegué al café Gijón&quot; (&quot;The night I arrived at the Café Gijón&quot; 1977)
*&quot;Memorias eróticas (Los cuerpos gloriosos)&quot; (&quot;Erotic memories: the glorious bodies&quot;, 1992)
*&quot;El hijo de Greta Garbo&quot; (&quot;Son of Greta Garbo&quot;, 1977).

<doc id="1127397" wikidata="Q1626665" url="?curid=1127397" title="Honda Ridgeline">
<text>The Honda Ridgeline is a mid-size pickup truck manufactured by Honda. Currently the company&#x27;s only pickup, it is built using a unibody frame and a transverse-mounted engine. It is offered only in a crew–cab short-box configuration with one powertrain.

== First generation (YK1; 2005) ==
The first-generation Ridgeline went on sale in March 2005 as a 2006 model year vehicle. &quot;The Car Design Yearbook&quot; called it &quot;Honda&#x27;s first foray into the true heartland of the American automotive way of life—the pickup truck.&quot; An engineering team from Honda R&amp;D Americas, led by Gary Flint, designed the vehicle. According to the author of &quot;Driving Honda&quot;, the automaker wanted to target buyers who were looking to move to a pickup from sedans, minivans, and sport utility vehicles (SUV).

The development started in 2001 with a development mule using an extended version of a first-generation Acura MDX with a competitor&#x27;s pickup bed integrated into the rear structure. After four years of development, a Sport Utility Truck Concept was shown at the 2004 North American International Auto Show. Later that same year, Honda unveiled a revised version at the Specialty Equipment Market Association show and announced the official name of the vehicle, the Ridgeline. The production version of the Ridgeline was unveiled the following year at the 2005 North American International Auto Show.

Honda&#x27;s publications claim that the first generation Ridgeline shared only 7% of its components with other Honda vehicles. Its powertrain resembled the one used in the first-generation Acura MDX but was &quot;extensively calibrated and strengthened&quot; for heavier hauling and towing duties.

Production of the first generation Ridgeline ended in early 2015.

== Second generation (YK2/3; 2016) ==

After a one-year hiatus in Ridgeline production, the second-generation went on sale in June 2016 as a 2017 model year vehicle. The second-generation Ridgeline took a different approach in design from the first generation Ridgeline by sharing Honda&#x27;s new &quot;global light truck platform,&quot; used for the third-generation Honda Pilot as well as other large Honda vehicles. Honda modified the Pilot platform, including extending the wheelbase and various parts to support hauling, towing, and off-road use. Honda reported that 73% of the second-generation Ridgeline&#x27;s components remain common with the third-generation Pilot. Major changes included a 17% stronger front structure, a 31% sturdier rear, and 50% of the chassis&#x27; components changed or were strengthened for the second generation Ridgeline. The second generation Ridgeline&#x27;s new structure gives it an average reduction in weight from the first generation pickup. The C-pillar and rear subframe were strengthened giving the second generation 28% more torsional rigidity over the first generation Ridgeline.

== Marketing ==
The design of the unibody pickup with a transverse-mounted engine and a crew-cab short-box configuration makes the Ridgeline unique. Some in the automotive press that have studied the first generation Ridgeline, such as PickupTrucks.com, consider it &quot;one of those odd vehicles.&quot; They wrote, &quot;The Ridgeline can&#x27;t really do what most people who like trucks need it to do.&quot; Others in the automotive press, such as The Driver&#x27;s Seat TV, had differing views and call the Ridgeline, &quot;the Swiss Army knife of trucks.&quot; They also described the Ridgeline &quot;the anti-truck&quot; and summarized their view by stating &quot;the Ridgeline scores high on practicality but very low on image.&quot;

Compared to the first-generation Ridgeline, Honda&#x27;s second-generation Ridgeline has the automotive press changing its tune, yet it still has an image problem. Gearheads.org wrote the &quot;2017 Honda Ridgeline still won’t get respect but should&quot; stating, its &quot;downside is going to be looks.&quot; &quot;Car and Driver&quot; wrote, &quot;The company [Honda] readily admits that the problem with the first generation pickup was that the styling was off-putting, but then it went ahead and made the next iteration of the truck just as unconventional as before.&quot; &quot;The Ridgeline’s roomy cabin, ample storage, smooth ride, and innovative touches make its rivals seem outdated. ...it not only has cargo space, but also the makings of a great tailgate party...&quot;

Karl Forster, an SAE trailer towing group member who was vehicle dynamics project leader on Honda&#x27;s unibody Ridgeline pickup and Pilot SUV described studies of pickup usage and &quot;found out that 84 percent of truck buyers tow 5000 pounds or less.&quot;

==Production and sales==
According to Honda, the Ridgeline was not designed to take sales from the traditional trucks marketed in North America, but was developed to &quot;give the 18% of Honda owners who also own pickups a chance to make their garages a Honda-only parking area.&quot; Despite the first generation Ridgeline&#x27;s poor sales, according to the author of &quot;Driving Honda&quot;, this mid-size pickup was one of the more profitable vehicles for Honda with reported sales in over 20 countries.

The second generation Ridgeline sales appeared to start strong but comparing sales in the US between 2017 and 2018 shows a 12% decline overall. A 2018 Autoline Daily report stated the Ridgeline is the only mid-size truck in North America whose sales are down in a market that &quot;suggests there’s room for more players.&quot;

<doc id="1127402" wikidata="Q8168" url="?curid=1127402" title="Pechora (river)">
<text>The Pechora (; Komi: Печӧра; Nenets: Санэроˮ яха) is the sixth-longest river in Europe. Flowing from Northwest Russia and into the Arctic Ocean, it lies mostly in the Komi Republic but the northernmost part crosses the Nenets Autonomous Okrug.

==Geography==

The Pechora is long (a little shorter than the Columbia River) and its basin is , or about the same size as Finland. By mean annual discharge it ranks third in Europe, after the Volga and Danube. Its discharge is about three quarters that of the Danube and a little more than its sister, the Northern Dvina, and is the largest of any river with no dams in its basin outside of New Guinea. 

West of its lower course is the Timan Ridge. East of the basin along the west flank of the Urals is the Yugyd Va National Park. Also in the basin is the Virgin Komi Forests, the largest virgin forest in Europe. In the far northeast of the basin on the Usa River is the large coal center of Vorkuta. The river was once an important transportation route, especially for those travelling to northwest Siberia. Today a railroad runs southwest from Vorkuta to Moscow.

===Along the Pechora===
The river rises in the Ural Mountains in the south-eastern corner of the Komi Republic. This area is part of the Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve. On the other side of the Urals are the headwaters of the Northern Sosva. The river flows south, then west and turns north near Yaksha which is the head of navigation for small boats. A portage led south to the Kama basin. To the east is the upper Vychegda, a tributary of the Northern Dvina. The river flows past Komsomolsk-na-Pechore to Ust-Ilych where the Ilych joins from the east, then Northwest to Troitsko-Pechorsk ( from the mouth), north to Vuktyl and Ust-Shchuger where the Shchugor joins from the east. The river then flows north to Pechora town, where the railway from Vorkuta crosses, then north to Ust-Usa where the Usa joins from the east (the Usa was once an important river route into Siberia). The Pechora then curves northwest, west, and west southwest. The Izhma joins from the south. It then flows further west to Ust-Tsilma ( from the mouth) where the Pizhma joins from the southwest and the Tsilma joins from the west. Before modern times people traveled up the Tsilma and portaged to the Pyoza to reach the White Sea. Then the Pechora turns north and crosses the arctic Arctic Circle and the border of the Nenets Okrug; Pustozyorsk; Naryan-Mar, the Nenets capital and a port at the head of the Pechora delta; Pechora Bay; Pechora Sea; and finally the Barents Sea.

==Hydrology==
The monthly average discharge of the river was recorded between 1981 and 1993 in the village of Oksino, located upstream from the mouth. The values are presented in the diagram below (metric units, m3/s).


==Canal projects to the Kama River==
Before the arrival of the railroad to the Pechora, an important way of travel to the region was via a portage road, from Cherdyn in the Kama basin to Yaksha on the Pechora.

A project for a Pechora–Kama Canal along the same general route was widely discussed in the 1960s through 1980s, this time not as much for transportation, but for the diversion of some of the water of the Pechora to the Kama, as part of a grand Northern river reversal scheme. However, no construction work was carried out on the route of the proposed canal, other than a triple nuclear explosion in 1971, which excavated a crater over long.

==Literary reference==
The Pechora was the source of the name of Pechorin – protagonist of the 1839 novel &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot; by Mikhail Lermontov, a well-known work of Russian literature.

<text>Richard Austin Quest (born 9 March 1962) is a British journalist and non-practising barrister working as a news anchor for CNN International. He is also an editor-at-large of CNN Business.

He anchors &quot;Quest Means Business&quot;, the five-times-weekly business programme and fronts the CNN shows &quot;Business Traveller&quot;, &quot;The Express&quot; and &quot;Quest&#x27;s World of Wonder&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Quest is a native of Liverpool in Lancashire (now Merseyside), England, having been born and partly brought up there. He is Jewish.

He was educated at the state comprehensive Roundhay School in Leeds, followed by Airedale and Wharfedale College and the University of Leeds, where he earned a Bachelor of Laws in 1983, and was called to the Bar. He spent the 1983–1984 academic year in the United States at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was the news director of WRVU.

==Career==
Quest became a trainee journalist at the BBC in 1985, joining its financial section in 1987, and moving to New York City in 1989 to become the BBC&#x27;s North American business correspondent.

Quest later worked for the BBC from the United States as part of its then-fledgling BBC News 24 channel. He was the business correspondent reporting on, and discussing the world stock market in a regular segment entitled &quot;World Business Report&quot; usually aired between 2:00 am and 3:00 am (GMT), a programme that he presented alongside Paddy O&#x27;Connell. He was also an occasional presenter on the BBC&#x27;s early-morning &quot;Business Breakfast&quot; programme.

Quest joined CNN in 2001, initially as co-presenter of newly-launched programme &quot;Business International&quot;. A year later, he moved to the European breakfast show BizNews, which he presented until 2005. Since this time Quest has covered a variety of different events for CNN, among others an analysis of the US elections as &quot;American Quest&quot; and the start of the circulation of Euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002 and the last official commercial flight of Concorde. He has also headed up CNN&#x27;s coverage of several events involving the British Royal Family.

In 2006, Quest turned down an opportunity to join Al Jazeera English news channel, the English language version of al-Jazeera, &quot;on the grounds that being gay and Jewish might not be suitable&quot;.

On 9 April 2015, Quest was announced as the host of the ABC game show &quot;500 Questions&quot;. He was replaced by Dan Harris for the show&#x27;s second season.

On 8 June 2015, Quest appeared as a contestant on &quot;The CNN Quiz Show: The Seventies Edition&quot; special produced by Eimear Crombie, along with his partner Brooke Baldwin playing for StandUp for Kids.

Quest is also an Aviation Correspondent for CNN, and extensively covered the story of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on 8 March 2014. Quest later wrote the book, &quot;The Vanishing of Flight MH370: The True Story of the Hunt for the Missing Malaysian Plane&quot;, published by Penguin Random House on 8 March 2016.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Quest was arrested in New York City&#x27;s Central Park &quot;with some drugs in his pocket, a rope around his neck that was tied to his genitals, and a sex toy in his boot.&quot; Quest admitted being in possession of crystal methamphetamine, a controlled substance.

On 26 June 2014, Quest described his past experience as a closeted gay man on his CNN television programme &quot;Quest Means Business&quot;.

<doc id="1127407" wikidata="Q7416215" url="?curid=1127407" title="Sandford principle">
<text>The Sandford principle is a concept in the management of protected landscapes in the United Kingdom. It is called the Sandford principle after Lord Sandford who chaired the National Parks Policy
Review Committee which reviewed national parks of England and Wales in between 1971 and 1974.

The two purposes of national parks are, in short,
#conservation of the natural environment and
#access for the public.

(Considering the economic and social well-being of the community is also a duty which was subsequently introduced and applies to more recently created parks).

The purposes were amended by the Environment Act 1995. They are now, firstly, to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area and, secondly, to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the area by the public.

Most of the time it is possible to achieve both the original two purposes by good management. Occasionally a situation arises where access for the public is in direct conflict with conservation. Following the ethos of the Sandford principle, the Environment Act 1995 sets down how a priority may be established between conservation and recreational use. Similar provision has been made for Scottish national parks.

The Sandford principle is often misquoted as &quot;conservation has priority over recreation&quot;; however, importantly, it is better summarised as, &quot;where those two purposes cannot be reconciled by skilful management, conservation should come first&quot;.

The Sandford principle was first used in UK national park management, and is still most commonly encountered in that context. However, where this dilemma has occurred in the management of other sites where public pressure and wildlife conservation might be in conflict, the principle is sometimes cited.

==The impact of the Environment Act 1995==

Key words in the 1974 National Parks Policy Review Committee report are &#x27;priority must be given to the conservation of natural beauty.&#x27; Although these words have been used in policy-making and decisions for many years, they were not a legal statement. When the principle was eventually translated into law in 1995, its interpretation and impact were subtly changed. 

The Environment Act 1995 s62 (1)(2) states:

This wording enshrines in law the issue at the heart of the Sandford principle, and hence, since 1995, consideration of the Sandford Principle has only been possible through the Environment Act. This is an important distinction because the Environment Act expresses the issue in more equitable terms by saying that the national park authority shall attach ‘greater weight to the purpose of conserving...’ rather than the phrase ‘priority must be given’ as used by Sandford and which was more absolute and directly in favour of conservation.

Use of the term ‘greater weight’ indicates clearly that evidence must be collected and weighed when deciding where public enjoyment might be considered a less desirable purpose than conservation. The word ‘purpose’ is significant in that it places a legal requirement on the national park authority to consider and demonstrate why it is conserving and enhancing the natural beauty, rather than doing so for no particular reason or simply suggesting an arbitrary priority.

<text>Mike Duhaney (born April 5, 1974) is an American retired professional soccer player who played in Major League Soccer (MLS) and the 2. Bundesliga. He was the 1997 Major League Soccer Rookie of the Year.

==Career==
Duhaney played college soccer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas from 1992 to 1994, where he was named first-team All-Conference in 1994. Upon graduating in 1994, he spent all of 1995 training full-time with the U.S. U-23 Olympic team. He also played four games for the U.S. team at the 1995 Pan American Games.

Duhaney was selected eighty-seventh overall in the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft by the Tampa Bay Mutiny. He lost the entire 1996 season due to a knee injury. In 1997, he seized the Mutiny&#x27;s left back position and started twenty-five games, earning MLS Rookie of the Year.

In June 1998, Duhaney was traded midway into the next season to the MetroStars in exchange for Paul Dougherty after the MetroStars backline was decimated by injuries. Although he saw a good deal of playing time with the Metros, he never settled in.

On January 28, 2000, was traded to the Columbus Crew in exchange for Thomas Dooley. Duhaney stayed in Columbus for two years, starting thirty-nine games for the team, but decided not to return after the 2001 season.

In 2002, Duhaney signed with 2. Bundesliga team 1. FSV Mainz 05.

<doc id="1127415" wikidata="Q51720" url="?curid=1127415" title="Tancred, Prince of Galilee">
<text>Tancred ( 1075 – December 5 or December 12, 1112) was an Italo-Norman leader of the First Crusade who later became Prince of Galilee and regent of the Principality of Antioch. Tancred came from the house of Hauteville and was the great-grandson of Norman lord Tancred of Hauteville.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Tancred was a son of Odo the Good Marquis and Emma of Hauteville. His maternal grandparents were Robert Guiscard and Guiscard&#x27;s first wife Alberada of Buonalbergo. Emma was also a sister of Bohemond I of Antioch.

===First Crusade===
In 1096, Tancred joined his maternal uncle Bohemond on the First Crusade, and the two made their way to Constantinople. There, he was pressured to swear an oath to Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, promising to give back any conquered land to the Byzantine Empire. Although the other leaders did not intend to keep their oaths, Tancred refused to swear the oath altogether. He participated in the siege of Nicaea in 1097, but the city was taken by Alexius&#x27; army after secret negotiations with the Seljuk Turks. Because of this, Tancred was very distrustful of the Byzantines.
In 1097, the Crusaders divided their forces at Heraclea Cybistra and Tancred entered the Levant by passing south through the Cilician Gates. He displayed the skills of a brilliant strategist by seizing five of the most important sites in Cilicia Pedias, which included the ancient cities of Tarsus and Adana, the great emporium at Mopsuestia, and the strategic castles at Sarvandikar and Anazarbus. The last three settlements were annexed to the Principality of Antioch. During their fourteen-year occupation of Anazarbus the Crusaders built the magnificent donjon atop the center of the fortified outcrop. At Sarvandikar, which controlled the strategic Amanus Pass, Tancred imprisoned Raymond of Saint-Gilles in 1101/02.

He assisted in the siege of Antioch in 1098. One year later, during the assault on Jerusalem, Tancred, along with Gaston IV of Béarn, claimed to have been the first Crusader to enter the city on July 15. &quot;(Alternative claim)&quot; When the city fell, Tancred along with other crusading armies participated in the sacking of the city. His biographer Ralph of Caen is cited to have said that &quot;Tancred was one of the most active participants in the decimation of the conquered Saracens.&quot; During the final stages of the battle Tancred gave his banner to a group of the citizens who had fled to the roof of the Temple of Solomon. This should have assured their safety, but in the confusion of the moment, they were massacred by other Crusaders who were sacking the city. The author of the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; (Deeds of the Franks) records that, when Tancred realized this, he was &quot;greatly angered&quot;. However, his fury was calmed by the argument that the possibility of a counter-attack meant it was too dangerous for the defenders of Jerusalem to be left alive. When the Kingdom of Jerusalem was established, Tancred became Prince of Galilee.

===Regent of Antioch===
In 1100, Tancred became regent of Antioch when Bohemond was taken prisoner by the Danishmends at the Battle of Melitene. He expanded the territory of the Latin principality by capturing land from the Byzantines, although, over the next decade, Alexius attempted, unsuccessfully, to bring him under Byzantine control. In 1104, he also took control of the County of Edessa when Baldwin II was taken captive after the Battle of Harran. After Baldwin&#x27;s release in late 1108, he had to fight Tancred (probably early 1109) to regain control of the county; Tancred was eventually defeated and returned to Antioch. After Harran, Bohemond returned to Europe to recruit more Crusaders, again leaving his nephew as regent in Antioch. Tancred&#x27;s victory over Radwan of Aleppo at the Battle of Artah in 1105 allowed the Latin principality to recover some its territories east of the Orontes River.

In 1108, Tancred refused to honour the Treaty of Devol, in which Bohemond swore an oath of fealty to Alexius, and for decades afterwards Antioch remained independent of the Byzantine Empire. In late September 1108, near Turbessel, Tancred, with 1,500 Frankish knights and infantry, and 600 Turkish horsemen sent by Fakhr al-Mulk Ridwan confronted Baldwin II and the 2,000 men of Jawali Saqawa, atabeg of Mosul. Tancred and Ridwan routed Jawali&#x27;s men, who took refuge in Turbessel. Later on, Tancred who had initially refused to abandon Turbessel to Baldwin II, decided at the assembly in Château Pèlerin in April 1109, to give up Turbessel in return for his restoration to his old domains in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

In 1110, he brought Krak des Chevaliers under his control, which would later become an important castle in the County of Tripoli. Tancred remained the regent of Antioch for Bohemond II until his death in 1112 during a typhoid epidemic. He had married Cecile of France, but died childless. Tancred was buried in the porch of St. Peter, the cathedral of Antioch.

The &quot;Gesta Tancredi&quot; is a biography of Tancred written in Latin by Ralph of Caen, a Norman who joined the First Crusade and served under Tancred and Bohemond. An English translation was co-published in 2005 by Bernard S. Bachrach and David S. Bachrach.

== Character ==

Ralph of Caen details Tancred&#x27;s personality in his chronicle and biography of him in the Gesta Tancredi. Ralph notes how Tancred was well aware of the innate sinfulness of the knightly profession and the violence it entailed, and how this led him to give up his life in Norman-dominated southern Italy to take part in Pope Urban II&#x27;s call for an armed pilgrimage. Tancred is described by Ralph as a very pious, violent hawk of a man. He was a shrewd, opportunistic warrior bred for conquest with a combative nature, but it also showcases a very pragmatic side of him concerning the even distribution among his men of the plunder gained following the despoliation of the mosques of Jerusalem after the city&#x27;s conquest by the Crusaders in 1099.

==In fiction==

Tancred appears as a character in Torquato Tasso&#x27;s 16th-century poem &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;, in which he is portrayed as an epic hero and given a fictional love interest, the pagan warrior-maiden Clorinda. This poem was the inspiration of the film, The Mighty Crusaders, about the Siege of Jerusalem in June–July 1099. He is also loved by the Princess Erminia of Antioch. Portions of Tasso&#x27;s verses were set by Claudio Monteverdi in his 1624 dramatic work &quot;Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot;. He also appears in one of the scenes in Imre Madách&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot;. In Tom Harper&#x27;s &quot;Siege of Heaven&quot; he is depicted as a violent psychopath. His portrayal is similar although slightly more humorous in Alfred Duggan&#x27;s novel &quot;Count Bohemond&quot;.

Tancred also appears as one of the Crusade leaders in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Count Robert of Paris&quot; who returned to Constantinople from Scutari to ensure a fair contest between Count Robert and his challenger. The novel &quot;Tancred, or the New Crusade&quot; by Benjamin Disraeli centres around the adventures of an imagined modern descendant and namesake of the Prince of Galilee. Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;Tancredi&quot; is based on Tasso, via Voltaire&#x27;s play &quot;Tancrède&quot; of 1759.

<text>The Arctic Winter Games are a biennial multi-sport and indigenous cultural event involving circumpolar peoples residing in communities or countries bordering the Arctic Ocean.

==History==
The Arctic Winter Games were founded in 1969 under the leadership of Alaska Governor Walter J. Hickel, Stuart (Stu) M. Hodgson, Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, and James Smith, Commissioner of Yukon. The idea to &quot;provide a forum where athletes from the &quot;circumpolar North&quot; could compete on their own terms, on their own turf&quot; came from Cal Miller, an advisor with the Yukon team at the 1967 Canada Winter Games. 

In 1970 in Yellowknife, Canada, 500 athletes, trainers and officials came together for the first Arctic Winter Games. The participants came from the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Alaska. Participants now come from Alaska, Northern Alberta, Yukon, Nunavut, Nunavik, Northwest Territories, Greenland, Finland and Norway. The games in 2002 were the first jointly hosted Arctic Winter Games, by Nuuk, Greenland, and Iqaluit, Nunavut. During the 2023 games, Prince William held a video conference with nine participants.

Designed to celebrate the unique sports and cultural heritage of the Arctic, the Games showcases a diverse range of competitions, traditional sports, and cultural events. With a strong emphasis on fostering friendship, cultural exchange, and athletic excellence, the Arctic Winter Games has become a platform for showcasing the talents and traditions of northern communities.

The next Arctic Winter Games are scheduled to take place in Whitehorse, Yukon from 8–15 March 2026.

==Nations==
# Canada - five regions (Alberta North, Northwest Territories, Nunavik, Nunavut, Yukon)
# United States - one region (Alaska)
# Greenland
# Sápmi - the region stretches over four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia

==Contingents==
Since 2004 the same nine contingents have participated in the Arctic Winter Games. Another four contingents have taken part in the games throughout the games&#x27; history: Russia, Magadan, Tyumen and Chukotka. In the table below is an overview of each contingent&#x27;s appearances throughout the games. Prior to the 2000 Arctic Winter Games Nunavut was part of the Northwest Territories. After division in 1999, Nunavut competed as separate contingent.

==Editions==

Host cities have been in Canada, the United States, and Greenland.


==Hodgson Trophy==
The Hodgson trophy for fair play and team spirit is awarded at the end of every games. The trophy is named for Stuart (Stu) Milton Hodgson, former Commissioner of the Northwest Territories.

The past winners of the trophy are:
==Arctic Winter Games International Committee==
The Arctic Winter Games International Committee consists of the following people
*John Rodda - Alaska, president
*Leigh Goldie - Alberta, vice president
*John Flynn - Yukon, past president
*Ian Laegraee - Northwest Territories, secretary
*Kyle Seely - Nunavut, director

<doc id="1127427" wikidata="Q4351325" url="?curid=1127427" title="Pisano period">
<text>In number theory, the &quot;n&quot;th Pisano period, written as &quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo &quot;n&quot; repeats. Pisano periods are named after Leonardo Pisano, better known as Fibonacci. The existence of periodic functions in Fibonacci numbers was noted by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1774.

== Definition ==

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the integer sequence:
:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, ... 
defined by the recurrence relation
:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3
For any integer &quot;n&quot;, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers &quot;Fi&quot; taken modulo &quot;n&quot; is periodic.
The Pisano period, denoted &quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), is the length of the period of this sequence. For example, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo 3 begins: 
:0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, ... 
This sequence has period 8, so &quot;&quot;(3) = 8.

==Properties==

=== Parity ===
With the exception of &#x27;(2) = 3, the Pisano period &#x27;(&quot;n&quot;) is always even. 
A proof of this can be given by observing that &quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is equal to the order of the Fibonacci matrix
:formula_4
in the general linear group formula_5of invertible 2 by 2 matrices in the finite ring formula_6of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;. Since Q has determinant −1, the determinant of Q&#x27;(&quot;n&quot;) is (−1)&#x27;(&quot;n&quot;), and since this must equal 1 in formula_6, either &quot;n&quot; ≤ 2 or &quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is even.

Since formula_1 and formula_2 we have that formula_10 divides formula_11 and formula_12.

=== Reducing the study to prime numbers ===
If &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime, then &#x27;(&quot;mn&quot;) is the least common multiple of &#x27;(&quot;m&quot;) and &#x27;(&quot;n&quot;), by the Chinese remainder theorem. For example, &#x27;(3) = 8 and &#x27;(4) = 6 imply &#x27;(12) = 24. Thus the study of Pisano periods may be reduced to that of Pisano periods of prime powers &quot;q&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;, for &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1.

If &quot;p&quot; is prime, &#x27;(&quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;) divides &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;–1 &#x27;(&quot;p&quot;). It is unknown if
formula_13
for every prime &quot;p&quot; and integer &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1. Any prime &quot;p&quot; providing a counterexample would necessarily be a Wall–Sun–Sun prime, and conversely every Wall–Sun–Sun prime &quot;p&quot; gives a counterexample (set &quot;k&quot; = 2).

=== Study of prime numbers ===
So the study of Pisano periods may be further reduced to that of Pisano periods of primes. In this regard, two primes are anomalous. The prime 2 has an odd Pisano period, and the prime 5 has period that is relatively much larger than the Pisano period of any other prime. The periods of powers of these primes are as follows:
* If &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;k&quot;, then &quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 3·2&quot;k&quot;–1 = = .
* if &quot;n&quot; = 5&quot;k&quot;, then &quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 20·5&quot;k&quot;–1 = = 4&quot;n&quot;.

From these it follows that if &quot;n&quot; = 2·5&quot;k&quot; then &quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 6&quot;n&quot;.

The remaining primes all lie in the residue classes formula_14 or formula_15. If &quot;p&quot; is a prime different from 2 and 5, then the modulo &quot;p&quot; analogue of Binet&#x27;s formula implies that &quot;&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is the multiplicative order of a root of modulo &quot;p&quot;. 

If formula_14, these roots belong to formula_17 (by quadratic reciprocity). Thus their order, &#x27;(&quot;p&quot;) is a divisor of &quot;p&quot; − 1. For example, &#x27;(11) = 11 − 1 = 10 and &quot;&quot;(29) = (29 − 1)/2 = 14.

If formula_18 the roots modulo &quot;p&quot; of do not belong to formula_19 (by quadratic reciprocity again), and belong to the finite field
:formula_20

As the Frobenius automorphism formula_21 exchanges these roots, it follows that, denoting them by &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, we have &quot;r&quot; &quot;p&quot; = &quot;s&quot;, and thus &quot;r&quot; &quot;p&quot;+1 = –1. That is &quot;r&quot; 2(&quot;p&quot;+1) = 1, and the Pisano period, which is the order of &quot;r&quot;, is the quotient of 2(&quot;p&quot;+1) by an odd divisor. This quotient is always a multiple of 4. The first examples of such a &quot;p&quot;, for which &#x27;(&quot;p&quot;) is smaller than 2(&quot;p&quot;+1), are &#x27;(47) = 2(47 + 1)/3 = 32, &#x27;(107) = 2(107 + 1)/3 = 72 and &#x27;(113) = 2(113 + 1)/3 = 76. (See the table below)

It follows from above results, that if &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; is an odd prime power such that &#x27;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; &quot;n&quot;, then &#x27;(&quot;n&quot;)/4 is an integer that is not greater than &quot;n&quot;. The multiplicative property of Pisano periods imply thus that
:&quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ≤ 6&quot;n&quot;, with equality if and only if &quot;n&quot; = 2 · 5&quot;r&quot;, for &quot;r&quot; ≥ 1.

The first examples are &#x27;(10) = 60 and &#x27;(50) = 300. If &quot;n&quot; is not of the form 2 · 5&quot;r&quot;, then &quot;&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ≤ 4&quot;n&quot;.

== Tables ==
The first twelve Pisano periods and their cycles (with spaces before the zeros for readability) are (using X and E for ten and eleven, respectively):

The first 144 Pisano periods are shown in the following table:

==Pisano periods of Fibonacci numbers==

If &quot;n&quot; = &quot;F&quot;(2&quot;k&quot;) (&quot;k&quot; ≥ 2), then π(&quot;n&quot;) = 4&quot;k&quot;; if &quot;n&quot; = &quot;F&quot;(2&quot;k&quot; + 1) (&quot;k&quot; ≥ 2), then π(&quot;n&quot;) = 8&quot;k&quot; + 4. That is, if the modulo base is a Fibonacci number (≥ 3) with an even index, the period is twice the index and the cycle has two zeros. If the base is a Fibonacci number (≥ 5) with an odd index, the period is four times the index and the cycle has four zeros.

==Pisano periods of Lucas numbers==
If &quot;n&quot; = &quot;L&quot;(2&quot;k&quot;) (&quot;k&quot; ≥ 1), then π(&quot;n&quot;) = 8&quot;k&quot;; if &quot;n&quot; = &quot;L&quot;(2&quot;k&quot; + 1) (&quot;k&quot; ≥ 1), then π(&quot;n&quot;) = 4&quot;k&quot; + 2. That is, if the modulo base is a Lucas number (≥ 3) with an even index, the period is four times the index. If the base is a Lucas number (≥ 4) with an odd index, the period is twice the index.

For even &quot;k&quot;, the cycle has two zeros. For odd &quot;k&quot;, the cycle has only one zero, and the second half of the cycle, which is of course equal to the part on the left of 0, consists of alternatingly numbers &quot;F&quot;(2&quot;m&quot; + 1) and &quot;n&quot; − &quot;F&quot;(2&quot;m&quot;), with &quot;m&quot; decreasing.

==Number of zeros in the cycle==
The number of occurrences of 0 per cycle is 1, 2, or 4. Let &quot;p&quot; be the number after the first 0 after the combination 0, 1. Let the distance between the 0s be &quot;q&quot;.
*There is one 0 in a cycle, obviously, if &quot;p&quot; = 1. This is only possible if &quot;q&quot; is even or &quot;n&quot; is 1 or 2.
*Otherwise there are two 0s in a cycle if &quot;p&quot;2 ≡ 1. This is only possible if &quot;q&quot; is even.
*Otherwise there are four 0s in a cycle. This is the case if &quot;q&quot; is odd and &quot;n&quot; is not 1 or 2.

For generalized Fibonacci sequences (satisfying the same recurrence relation, but with other initial values, e.g. the Lucas numbers) the number of occurrences of 0 per cycle is 0, 1, 2, or 4.

The ratio of the Pisano period of &quot;n&quot; and the number of zeros modulo &quot;n&quot; in the cycle gives the &quot;rank of apparition&quot; or &quot;Fibonacci entry point&quot; of &quot;n&quot;. That is, smallest index &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;n&quot; divides &quot;F&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). They are:

:1, 3, 4, 6, 5, 12, 8, 6, 12, 15, 10, 12, 7, 24, 20, 12, 9, 12, 18, 30, 8, 30, 24, 12, 25, 21, 36, 24, 14, 60, 30, 24, 20, 9, 40, 12, 19, 18, 28, 30, 20, 24, 44, 30, 60, 24, 16, 12, ... 

In Renault&#x27;s paper the number of zeros is called the &quot;order&quot; of &quot;F&quot; mod &quot;m&quot;, denoted formula_22, and the &quot;rank of apparition&quot; is called the &quot;rank&quot; and denoted formula_23.

According to Wall&#x27;s conjecture, formula_24. If formula_25 has prime factorization formula_26 then formula_27.

== Number theory ==
Pisano periods can be analyzed using algebraic number theory.

Let formula_28 be the &quot;n&quot;-th Pisano period of the &quot;k&quot;-Fibonacci sequence &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) (&quot;k&quot; can be any natural number, these sequences are defined as &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;(0) = 0, &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;(1) = 1, and for any natural number &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;kF&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−1) + &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−2)). If &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime, then formula_29, by the Chinese remainder theorem: two numbers are congruent modulo &quot;mn&quot; if and only if they are congruent modulo &quot;m&quot; and modulo &quot;n&quot;, assuming these latter are coprime. For example, formula_30 and formula_31 so formula_32 Thus it suffices to compute Pisano periods for prime powers formula_33 (Usually, formula_34, unless &quot;p&quot; is &quot;k&quot;-Wall–Sun–Sun prime, or &quot;k&quot;-Fibonacci–Wieferich prime, that is, &quot;p&quot;2 divides &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;p&quot; − 1) or &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;p&quot; + 1), where &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the &quot;k&quot;-Fibonacci sequence, for example, 241 is a 3-Wall–Sun–Sun prime, since 2412 divides &quot;F&quot;3(242).)

For prime numbers &quot;p&quot;, these can be analyzed by using Binet&#x27;s formula:
:formula_35 where formula_36 is the &quot;k&quot;th metallic mean
:formula_37

If &quot;k&quot;2 + 4 is a quadratic residue modulo &quot;p&quot; (where &quot;p&quot; &gt; 2 and &quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;k&quot;2 + 4), then formula_38 and formula_39 can be expressed as integers modulo &quot;p&quot;, and thus Binet&#x27;s formula can be expressed over integers modulo &quot;p&quot;, and thus the Pisano period divides the totient formula_40, since any power (such as formula_41) has period dividing formula_42 as this is the order of the group of units modulo &quot;p&quot;.

For &quot;k&quot; = 1, this first occurs for &quot;p&quot; = 11, where 42 = 16 ≡ 5 (mod 11) and 2 · 6 = 12 ≡ 1 (mod 11) and 4 · 3 = 12 ≡ 1 (mod 11) so 4 = , 6 = 1/2 and 1/ = 3, yielding &quot;φ&quot; = (1 + 4) · 6 = 30 ≡ 8 (mod 11) and the congruence

:formula_43

Another example, which shows that the period can properly divide &quot;p&quot; − 1, is &quot;π&quot;1(29) = 14.

If &quot;k&quot;2 + 4 is not a quadratic residue modulo &quot;p&quot;, then Binet&#x27;s formula is instead defined over the quadratic extension field formula_44, which has &quot;p&quot;2 elements and whose group of units thus has order &quot;p&quot;2 − 1, and thus the Pisano period divides &quot;p&quot;2 − 1. For example, for &quot;p&quot; = 3 one has &quot;π&quot;1(3) = 8 which equals 32 − 1 = 8; for &quot;p&quot; = 7, one has &quot;π&quot;1(7) = 16, which properly divides 72 − 1 = 48.

This analysis fails for &quot;p&quot; = 2 and &quot;p&quot; is a divisor of the squarefree part of &quot;k&quot;2 + 4, since in these cases are zero divisors, so one must be careful in interpreting 1/2 or formula_45. For &quot;p&quot; = 2, is congruent to 1 mod 2 (for &quot;k&quot; odd), but the Pisano period is not &quot;p&quot; − 1 = 1, but rather 3 (in fact, this is also 3 for even &quot;k&quot;). For &quot;p&quot; divides the squarefree part of &quot;k&quot;2 + 4, the Pisano period is &quot;π&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;k&quot;2 + 4) = &quot;p&quot;2 − &quot;p&quot; = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;p&quot; − 1), which does not divide &quot;p&quot; − 1 or &quot;p&quot;2 − 1.

==Fibonacci integer sequences modulo &quot;n&quot;==
One can consider Fibonacci integer sequences and take them modulo &quot;n&quot;, or put differently, consider Fibonacci sequences in the ring Z/&quot;n&quot;Z. The period is a divisor of π(&quot;n&quot;). The number of occurrences of 0 per cycle is 0, 1, 2, or 4. If &quot;n&quot; is not a prime the cycles include those that are multiples of the cycles for the divisors. For example, for &quot;n&quot; = 10 the extra cycles include those for &quot;n&quot; = 2 multiplied by 5, and for &quot;n&quot; = 5 multiplied by 2.

Table of the extra cycles: (the original Fibonacci cycles are excluded) (using X and E for ten and eleven, respectively)

Number of Fibonacci integer cycles mod &quot;n&quot; are:
:1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4, 8, 5, 6, 14, 10, 7, 8, 12, 16, 9, 16, 22, 16, 29, 28, 12, 30, 13, 14, 14, 22, 63, 24, 34, 32, 39, 34, 30, 58, 19, 86, 32, 52, 43, 58, 22, 78, 39, 46, 70, 102, ...

<text>Gilberto Martínez Vidal (born October 1, 1979) is a Costa Rican former professional footballer who played as a defender.

==Club career==

===Deportivo Saprissa===
Born in the Pacific Coast town of in Golfito, Costa Rica, Martínez made his professional debut for Deportivo Saprissa on 19 January 2000 in a 4–0 win over Cartaginés. His performances in the domestic league and Nigeria&#x27;s Football World Youth Championship soon earned him a place on the Costa Rica national football team. Martínez quickly established himself there as well, becoming one of the most wanted and loved from the fans. He started all three of the team&#x27;s games in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and his performances were well regarded.

===Brescia Calcio===
Due to his World Cup performances, Brescia purchased him from Deportivo Saprissa on September 15 of the same year. In his initial seasons with Brescia, Martínez established himself as a mainstay in the &quot;rondinelle&quot; defense line. However, an ankle injury he suffered during the 2006 FIFA World Cup limited him in the following seasons; he spent the whole 2006–07 season on loan to Roma, but failed to make an impact as he failed to recover from his injury. He returned to Brescia at the start of the 2007–08 season without having made a single appearance for the Rome-based club. He ultimately made his playing comeback in the 2008–09 season, confirming himself once again as a key player for his club, then in Serie B.

In February 2011 he was loaned to Sampdoria.

In January 2013, Martínez joined Lecce.

==International career==
He was part of Costa Rica&#x27;s national team in the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship held in Nigeria.

Nicknamed &quot;Tuma&quot;, Martínez made his debut for Costa Rica in a January 2001 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Guatemala and earned a total of 61 caps, scoring no goals. He represented his country in 26 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at both the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. He also played at the 2001 UNCAF Nations Cup as well as at the 2002 and 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cups.

He also played at the 2001 Copa América.

His final international was a March 2011 friendly match against Argentina.

<doc id="1127442" wikidata="Q6893044" url="?curid=1127442" title="Mohammed Burhanuddin">
<text>Mohammed Burhanuddin (6 March 1915 – 17 January 2014) was the 52nd Dā&#x27;ī al-Mutlaq of Dawoodi Bohras. He led the community for 49 years in a period of social, economic, and educational prosperity; strengthened and re-institutionalized the fundamental core of the community&#x27;s faith; revived its culture, tradition, and heritage. In successfully achieving coexistence of traditional Islamic values and modern Western practices within the community, Burhanuddin completed the work his predecessor Taher Saifuddin had started. Burhanuddin was presented the highest national civilian honors of the states of Egypt and Jordan recognising his revivalism and restoration efforts. He was known in Arab countries as &quot;Azamat us-Sultan&quot; (). Owing to extensive travels for community reach-out, he was the first &quot;Dā&#x27;ī al-Mutlaq&quot; to visit Europe, Australia, and America.

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Burhanuddin was born to Taher Saifuddin and Husaina Aaisaheba in Surat in the Indian state of Gujarat.

Burhanuddin, taught by his father, completed his religious education at the age of 13. Following Burhanuddin&#x27;s &quot;mīthāq&quot; (oath) in Surat, aged 15, he was appointed &quot;Amir al-Hajj&quot; (), was conferred the title of &quot;Shaykh&quot; (), and bestowed the laqab of &quot;Burhan al-Din&quot; () by his father, Taher Saifuddin.

On his 17th birthday, Burhanuddin was promoted to the rank of &quot;Haddiyah&quot; () and made in charge of &quot;Alvazaratus Saifiyah&quot;, the central administrative body of the community. At age 19, Taher Saifuddin designated him as his successor to the office of the &quot;Dai al-Mutlaq&quot; (), and subsequently elevated him to the station of &quot;Mazoon al-Da&#x27;wat&quot; (), making him his second-in-command. By age 20, Burhanuddin had committed the entire Quran to memory.

=== Marriage and family ===
Burhanuddin married Amatullah Aaisaheba in 1937 in Surat. She was the daughter of Abdul Husain, a descendant of the 46th Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq Abdul Qadir Najmuddin. The city and the &quot;Iwan&quot; () of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, the main venue of the celebrations, were decorated heavily. Taher Saifuddin extended an open invitation to all community members to attend the ceremonies, and had also invited distinguished dignitaries and government officials.

Burhanuddin and Amatullah had 10 children, seven sons and three daughters.

=== Al-Dai al-Mutlaq ===
After the demise of his father, Taher Saifuddin on 12 November 1965, Mohammed Burhanuddin presided over a 40-day mourning period and assumed the office of his predecessor. He chose the burial place of his father to be Qasre Husaini (Raudat Tahera), the site where the shrines of Imam Ali and Imam Husain were fabricated.

=== Centenary ===
In 2011, Burhanuddin, celebrated his centenary in accordance with the Islamic calendar. A mega procession was organised in Mumbai that started from MG Road to Azam Campus Grounds (the route is popularly known as Marine Drive) involving 8000 participants. Followers were dressed in golden robes traversing on horses or upon chariots. Various floats were a part of the parade displaying a variety of accomplishments during Burhanuddin&#x27;s tenure. Similar processions took place at community centers across the world. During the ceremonies held over the period of a week, Burhanuddin laid the foundation stone for the SBUT project in Bhendi Bazar and announced the opening of a branch of the Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah university in Nairobi, Kenya.

=== Succession ===

Burhanuddin spent a few days every year in London, where he had a home. During one such visit in 2011, he suffered a stroke and was admitted to Cromwell Hospital. Some days after being admitted to the hospital, he appointed his 2nd son, Mufaddal Saifuddin, as his successor holding a few members of his immediate family to bear witness, as per the religious traditions. He asked for the news to be communicated to all community members.

Upon his return to Mumbai, Burhanuddin visited the mausoleum of his father. There, he reiterated his proclamation upon Mufaddal Saifuddin as his successor-designate amongst thousands of onlookers, the event also being broadcast to a number of other locations in Mumbai.

== Activities ==
=== Libas al-Anwar ===
Burhanuddin issued a dress code, calling for male Bohras to grow a beard and wear a white topi and kurta, and for women to wear a colorful two piece abaya, known formally as a Rida. This Islamization countered a trend toward assimilation into the larger culture of their ancestors that was also prevalent under his predecessor, Taher Saifuddin and the previous Du&#x27;at before them. The history of this culture can be traced back to the medieval Fatimid dynasty in Egypt.

=== Al-Jame al-Anwar ===

In 1980 CE/1401 AH, the Al-Hakim mosque was extensively refurbished in white marble and gold trim by Mohammed Burhanuddin. Remnants of the original decorations, including stucco carvings, timber tie-beams, and Quranic inscriptions were restored as part of the renovations. His intent to restore the ancient Al-Hakim Mosque as a place of worship in contemporary times necessitated a lighting solution that provided this important functionality to the mosque and did so in a manner that paid tribute to the Fatimid tradition of illumination and its aesthetics. The miraculous emergence of the mishkat or small lantern from the niche of the richly decorated façade of Al Jami al Aqmar provided that solution. The niche in which the lantern motif was found has also been compared to the mihrab niche of Al Azhar mosque, the same also now found in Al-Hakim mosque, which has a central motif that resembles a large lamp or lantern.

=== Educational contributions ===
In October 1999, Burhanuddin was elected Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University, a position that his father also held. He is credited with expanding the two century old Arabic university Al Jamea tus Saifiyah. In 1983, a new campus of &quot;Al Jamea tus Saifiyah&quot; was built by him in Karachi. He built the &quot;Burhaniyah Business Counseling Center&quot; in Mumbai to provide modern business solutions. He also built the &quot;Raudat Tahera&quot;, a mausoleum of his father Taher Saifuddin in Mumbai, India. It is one of a kind, having the entire Quran inscribed on its inner white walls in letters decorated with of gold leaves and with precious stones. It was inaugurated in 1975 by the erstwhile President of India Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed.

In 1976, he established a facility exclusively dedicated to the study of arts and sciences of the Quran.

==== MSB Schools ====

MSB (also known as Al Madrasa Tus Saifiya Tul Burhaniyah) was founded by Burhanuddin in 1984, with its first two branches in Mumbai, India and Nairobi, Kenya. It is accredited with the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education and is operated under the purview of the office of the Dai al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohras. The institute has branches in 25 cities across India, Pakistan, East Africa, and the Middle East.

==== Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah ====
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, Mohammed Burhanuddin established a third campus of the institute of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah in Nairobi, Kenya.
Two years later, his son Mufaddal Saifuddin, announced the dedication of yet another campus of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah in Marol (Mumbai) on his behalf. 
The construction of each campus is centered around a masjid, with all buildings oriented towards the Kaaba in Mecca.
All four campuses have integrated green building techniques and observe environmental friendly operations. The buildings have been designed to utilize sunlight and facilitate natural ventilation as much as possible, and avoid dependency on artificial methods that consume great amounts of electricity, for e.g. solar water heating systems have been used in the dormitories of the Surat campus. A layout of coconut trees planted along the perimeter of the Karachi campus’ sports field mitigates waterlogging not only in Jamea but also in the surrounding homes. Recycling, compost facilities, motion sensor lighting and paper reduction policies are also applied in all four campuses.

=== Al-Multaqa al-Fatemi al-Ilmi ===
In the year 1978, Burhanuddin held a historic Islamic conference in Surat where he called upon delegates of the community centers to adhere to the time-tested traditions of their faith while also embracing the beneficial ‘new’ with the advent of scientific advancements. Amongst his important messages to the community was to renounce the practice of riba (). The congregation initially started in Surat and was thereafter held in Mumbai, Karachi, Nairobi and Dar es salaam between 1978 - 1988.

The first gathering at Surat in 1978 was held in Iwaan al-Barakat () of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah. Burhanuddin laid down seven principles in this meet to develop social, educational and economic fervor amongst his followers.

In 1984, on the twin occasions of the 100th birth anniversary of his father, Taher Saifuddin and the 1400th birth anniversary of Husayn ibn Ali, Muhammed&#x27;s grandson; Burhanuddin laid down another set of principles similar in spirit to the ones established before with the added emphasis of &quot;Qardan Hasana&quot; (), which are interest-free loans. The abolition of &quot;riba&quot; from an institutional level and to certain extents on an individual level is considered to be the highlight of these meetings.

=== Community kitchens ===
Burhanuddin established community kitchens (viz. &quot;Faiz al-Mawaid al-Burhaniyah&quot;) to provide meals everyday to the Dawoodi Bohra families, thus providing free time for women to pursue economic, educational or religious activities. The community kitchens don&#x27;t discriminate between the privileged and the underprivileged sections, both getting the same &quot;good quality and hygienically-prepared&quot; food, while the community members have the provision of paying for their own family, and for sponsoring those who cannot afford it.

=== Medical aid ===
==== Saifee Hospital ====

Burhanuddin conceptualized and established Saifee Hospital in Mumbai, a state-of-the-art, multi-specialty, 250-bed hospital. It was inaugurated in 2005 by Dr. Manmohan Singh, the erstwhile prime minister of India. During the inauguration, Dr Singh said: &quot;The Bohra community has made a noble and significant contribution to society at large in constructing the Saifee Hospital and I too pray and hope that it benefits all sections of our society&quot; 

The main vision of the hospital is to provide preventive, curative and holistic care to individuals from every strata. The hospital consists of 2574 beds and is a multi-speciality healthcare destination. It has 44 ICU beds, 9 Operational Theatres and conducts approximately 10,000 surgeries in a year. It has been certified by ‘The International Standards Organisation’ (ISO) and National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL).

The hospital specializes in Robotic Surgeries, Bariatric Surgeries, Cardiology, Critical Care Medicine and Dentistry among other services.

==== Burhani Medical Idara ====
Mohammed Burhanuddin set up the Burhani Medical Idara (Department). The aim of this department is to provide medical aid to the members of the Dawoodi Bohra community.

The official website of the department has an online Doctor&#x27;s directory which enlists the name of all doctors of the community who are providing their services free of charge. As of 15 December 2019, a total of 2549 doctors have been registered with the department. The ratio of doctors with respect to the total members of the community is 1:300.

Apart from this, hospitals have been established all across the globe in places such as Tanzania and Pakistan, where medical aid is provided at a subsidised rate.

Saifee Ambulance in Mumbai provides subsidised medical services to the local neighbourhood.  It extends  help in hospitalisation, immunisation and blood donation. It also sets up regular medical camps.

=== Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust ===

One of Burhanuddin&#x27;s major undertakings was the establishment of the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust. This redevelopment project comprising 16.5 acres of landform has approximately 250 existing buildings, 1250 shops and 3200 families under its radar in South Mumbai. The idea is to incorporate the locality&#x27;s dilapidated structures into a more sustainable development project, with new buildings, modern infrastructure, wider roads, more open spaces and commercial establishments.

Using the ‘best principles of urban planning’ the project aims to meet the present and future socio-economic needs of the people. The neighborhood, famously known as &quot;Bhendi Bazaar&quot; has been divided into 7 sub-clusters. The majority of the flats in these buildings will relocate the existing tenants/occupants to better accommodation. 
The area will have its own environment-friendly decorum along with an efficient sewage treatment plant, solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and garbage disposal units. The project aims to be resource neutral. It has already been pre-certified &#x27;Gold&#x27; by the Indian Green Buildings Council.

=== Memorisation of the Quran ===
Burhanuddin emphasized ‘memorising the entire Quran’. There are several examples where Burhanuddin has announced this idea on an international level, for example on the occasion of completion of 1400 years of Quranic revelation on Mohammed (1387 H), and in the International Islamic Conference on Aspects of Islamic Studies at Albert Hall, London (Meherjaan al-Alami al Islami 1976 CE) he addressed this desire in his speech. Subsequently, in that same year, a Quranic  institute by the name of Mahad al-Zahra was established by him. The main objectives of this institution is to facilitate learning of the art of recitation, memorization and understanding of the Quran and its sciences.

Mohammed Burhanuddin had inaugurated Mahad al-Zahra, Karachi in the year 1404H, during his birthday celebrations there. In 1415 H, he delivered a sermon where he stressed upon the memorisation of the Quran and directed the students of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah to commit the entire Quran to memory. In the following year 1416 H, Husain Burhanuddin, the grandson of Mohammed Burhanuddin memorised the  entire Quran and since then this initiative has taken traction tenfold.

In the year 1418 H/ 1998, Burhanuddin laid down the foundation for a new branch of Mahad al-Zahra in Surat (India). The new facility provides the ideal environment of comfort and peace for the students engrossed in the demanding memorisation process. This institute also houses an audio studio where various recordings have been taped. The entire Quran has also been recorded and distributed via CDs and lately, through the internet. Students of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah memorise the Quran under this institution and render teaching services to community members residing in different parts of the world. In H 1433 / C.E. 2013, a kindergarten named Rawdat al-Quran al-Kareem (RQK) was established in Mumbai with the aim of nurturing young pupils in the light of the Quran.

==== E-learning ====
In the year 2005, a distance-learning memorization program was launched to reach out to members of the community who live in distant cities such as Sydney, Australia, Los Angeles.

=== Marriage ceremonies ===
Burhanuddin continued his father&#x27;s tradition of organising mass marriages, known as &quot;Rasm-e Saifee&quot;, during his visits to various Dawoodi Bohra communities. &quot;Taiseer un Nikah&quot;, an international committee, plays principal role in match-making, counseling, and facilitating the solemnization of these marriages.

==Ashara Mubaraka==
&lt;section begin=&quot;asharasmb&quot; /&gt;The &quot;Ashara Mubaraka&quot; () is an annual mourning of Husayn ibn Ali&#x27;s martyrdom at the Battle of Karbala. In the tradition of the Fatimids, the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq delivers ten &quot;wa&#x27;az&quot; () on Islamic philosophy, , liturgy, expository, horatory over 9 days: One &quot;wa&#x27;az&quot; each day for 8 days starting 2nd Muharram and two on the final day of Ashura (), the 10th of Muharram. Every year the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq selects a city to host the &quot;Ashara&quot; at which, at times, attract 100,000 to 200,000 &quot;azadar-e Husayn&quot; (). The &quot;ashara wa&#x27;az&quot; from the host city is, on occasion, broadcast to various venues around the world. Pilgrims are often provided with free accommodation, transportation, and meals. The faculty of &quot;Funun al-Quran&quot;, a department of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, oversees elaborate &quot;Tazyeen&quot; () of the host venue.&lt;section end=&quot;asharasmb&quot; /&gt;

== Teaching ==

=== Patriotism ===
Mohammed Burhaunndin always instructed his followers to be patriotic to the state they resided in. In Islam, loyalty to the land of abode is an integral part of one&#x27;s faith. Mohammed Burhanuddin urged his followers to follow the laws of the country they live in and strive to be good citizens. Dawoodi Bohras have therefore become well integrated into the various societies that they have become part of, in the countries in which they reside. They are active in community help efforts and also partake in social drives and campaigns.

=== Islamic Identity ===
Throughout his 50 years in the office, Mohammed Burhaunndin strove to imbibe a particular Islamic identity to his followers. The most prominent distinction of the Dawoodi Bohra community is their religious attire, known as the Libas-al-Anwar (lit. Radiant Clothes.) For men, it usually consists of a trouser-like pant called an izar, coupled with a loose elongated shirt-like draping over the upper body --- called a kurta along with an overcoat called a saya, which is topped off by a skull cap called - Topi. The women&#x27;s attire is called a ‘Rida’ which is an all-covering dress worn by Bohra women. Furthermore, the men in the community adorn a full-grown beard which adds to their distinctive identity.

In addition to the distinctive clothes, he also urged his followers to speak a unique language, known as the Lisan-al-Da’wah (the language of Da’wah). The language is predominantly rooted in Arabic and Gujarati with a mix of words from other languages such as Urdu and Persian.

Burhanuddin has also supported the movement towards Islamic English where the expression of Islamic norms and Quranic concepts are better articulated in the English language without compromising the meaning. For example ‘Mosque’ though derived from the Arabic word ‘Masjid’ fails to convey the original meaning of the word, ‘a place for prostration or sajda.

=== Upliftment ===
During his life, Mohammed Burhanuddin regularly urged his followers to extend help to the less fortunate in society. In the year H 1424 H/ C.E. 2002, during his visit to the island nation of Madagascar, Burhanuddin instituted the idea of ‘upliftment’ and called upon all the members of the community to help their fellow community members. Along with the community members, he expanded his efforts to help the society at large. This can be understood by the aids provided by him in the aftermath of the Bombay Riots and the Bhuj earthquake.
During the month of Ramadan, the less fortunate members of the community would be provided essentials such as clothes, food, shelter and medical services.

To carry out these functions, Mohammed Burhanuddin set up institutions such as His Holiness Doctor Syedna Taher Saifuddin Memorial Foundation (STSMF).

=== Trade and business ===
The new Trust was aimed to provide modern solutions for today&#x27;s modern business. Throughout his life, Mohammed Burhanuddin urged his community to enter the world of trade, business and industrialization. The word ‘Bohra’ itself denotes the meaning of ‘a trader’. Mohammed Burhanuddin encouraged his followers to move forward and expand their businesses. He stressed to his followers to keep the tradition of business and entrepreneurship intact in the community. To help his followers to that extent, Mohammed Burhanuddin institutionalized the concept of Islamic Loans which are interest free, known as Qardan Hasanah (Good Loans). In 1991, Mohammed Burhanuddin established the Burhani Qardan Hasana Trust. The main goal of this trust is to provide interest free loans to community members to fulfill their economic goals and help expand their businesses. Furthermore, to help enhance his community members&#x27; business skills, Mohammed Burhanuddin set up the Burhaniyah Business Counseling Centre (BBCC) in Mumbai. The center organized numerous expos named Burhani Expo to help connect community members with each other to expand their businesses and create a global network of traders within the community.

In 2014, Mohammed Burhanuddin again re-institutionalized this concept by renaming the Qardan Hasnah trust by the name of Hasanaat al Qardan Hasan al Burhaniyah. The BBCC was also absorbed by this new trust and a new department was formed to help community members prosper in their business endeavors. This department was named ‘Tijarat Rabeha’ which translates into Profitable Business. The main aim of this department is to facilitate the needs of new and upcoming entrepreneurs within the community by providing modern day solutions and ideas to them. It also organizes numerous seminars, workshops and webinars to help existing businessmen within the community expand their businesses and evolve their business acumen in course with the ever changing times.

=== Welfare of women ===
Burhanuddin formed the Amatullah Aaisaheba Memorial Trust in 1996 in memory of his late wife, Amatullah Aai who had played a leading role in the welfare of the Dawoodi Bohra women. The trust lays particular emphasis on the support of home industries run by women.

=== Housing complexes ===
The community facilitates schemes to provide flats and houses at cheaper rates. Several housing complexes have been established all over India, for example in Kalyan, Marol and even in foreign countries such as in Nairobi, Kenya.

In H 1426 / C.E. 2004, a department known as Faiz Enayat Amakene Anwar was established in Mumbai. The main aim of this department is to provide better living conditions for those living in poor conditions.

==Awards and honors==

=== Religious titles ===

Over the course of Burhanuddin&#x27;s tenure as &quot;Mazoon al-Dawat&quot;, he was bestowed numerous &quot;khitabaat&quot; () by his predecessor, Taher Saifuddin, owing to his accomplishments in the service of the Dawoodi Bohra community and the society at large. These titles were topic of all ten &quot;waaz&quot; of his son Mufaddal Saifuddin&#x27;s first &quot;Ashara Mubaraka&quot; as the 53rd Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, in 2014.

== Death ==
Burhanuddin died of cardiac arrest at his home Saifee Mahal in Mumbai on 17 January 2014. The Bohra community announced a 40-day mourning period in respect of the departed leader. His second son and successor, Mufaddal Saifuddin led the Salat al-Janazah () of his father at &quot;Ghurrat al-Masajid&quot;, after which he was buried at Raudat Tahera besides his father Taher Saifuddin. The Indian flag was flown at half-mast as a mark of state mourning.

The day after his demise, a crowd of supporters peacefully assembled outside his residence to pay their respects; Unfortunately, when the gates were opened to let them in, a human stampede ensued, killing eighteen people.
A commemoration service held one year after Burhanuddin&#x27;s death drew an estimated three hundred thousand bohras to Mumbai; two dedicated townships were built specially to accommodate them.

==Succession==

Mohammed Burhanuddin died in January 2014. As per the tenets of the sect each predecessor is required to nominate his successor during his lifetime. His death sparked a succession crisis where two rival claimants emerged for the title of 53rd Dā&#x27;ī al-Mutlaq: his son, Mufaddal Saifuddin, and his half-brother, Khuzaima Qutbuddin, who was previously &quot;Mazoon&quot; of the Dawoodi Bohra.

The challenge created a divide in the community with the vast majority aligning with Mufaddal Saifuddin whilst a small number aligned with Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Mufaddal Saifuddin assumed control of the Dawoodi Bohra administration and infrastructure. He is largely accepted as the Bohras&#x27; leader by governments and other public bodies. The UK Charity Commission has stated in writing, that &quot;our view is that His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin is the current incumbent of the office of Dai al-Mutlaq.&quot;

== Genealogy ==
Burhanuddin is a descendant of leaders of the early Fatimid mission in India, Fakhr al-Din Shaheed, Abd al-Qadir Hakim al-din, Khanji Pheer, and Syedi Lukman.The family tree shown below illustrate the clear link.

== Notable works ==
=== Rasāʾil Ramaḍāniyya (Epistles) ===

<doc id="1127447" wikidata="Q1252472" url="?curid=1127447" title="Strategic group">
<text>A strategic group is a concept used in strategic management that groups companies within an industry that have similar business models or similar combinations of strategies. For example, the restaurant industry can be divided into several strategic groups including fast-food and fine-dining based on variables such as preparation time, pricing, and presentation. The number of groups within an industry and their composition depends on the dimensions used to define the groups. Strategic management professors and consultants often make use of a two dimensional grid to position firms along an industry&#x27;s two most important dimensions in order to distinguish direct rivals (those with similar strategies or business models) from indirect rivals. Strategy is the direction and scope of an organization over the long term which achieves advantages for the organization while business model refers to how the firm will generate revenues or make money.

Hunt (1972) coined the term strategic group while conducting an analysis of the appliance industry after he discovered a higher degree of competitive rivalry than suggested by industry concentration ratios. He attributed this to the existence of subgroups within the industry that competed along different dimensions making tacit collusion more difficult. These asymmetrical strategic groups caused the industry to have more rapid innovation, lower prices, higher quality and lower profitability than traditional economic models would predict.

Michael Porter (1980) developed the concept and applied it within his overall system of strategic analysis. He explained strategic groups in terms of what he called &quot;mobility barriers&quot;. These are similar to the entry barriers that exist in industries, except they apply to groups within an industry. Because of these mobility barriers a company can get drawn into one strategic group or another. Strategic groups are not to be confused with Porter&#x27;s generic strategies which are internal strategies and do not reflect the diversity of strategic styles within an industry.

Originally, the analysis of intra-industry variations in the competitive behaviour and performance of firms was based primarily on the use of secondary financial and accounting data. The study of strategic groups from a cognitive perspective, however, has gained prominence during the past years (Hodgkinson 1997).

== Strategic Group Analysis ==

Strategic Group Analysis (SGA) aims to identify organizations with similar strategic characteristics, following similar strategies or competing on similar bases.

Such groups can usually be identified using two or perhaps three sets of characteristics as the bases of competition.

Examples of the SGA: 
* Extent of product (or service) diversity.
* Extent of geographic coverage.
* Number of market segments served.
* Distribution channels used.
* Extent of branding.
* Marketing effort.
* Degree of vertical integration.
* Product (or service) quality.
* Pricing policy.

Use of Strategic Group Analysis
This analysis is useful in several ways:
* Helps identify who the most direct competitors are and on what basis they compete.
* Raises the question of how likely or possible it is for another organization to move from one strategic group to another.
* Strategic Group mapping might also be used to identify opportunities.
* Can also help identify strategic problems.

Jeannet and Schreuder (2015, pp. 95–99) provide an example how Strategic Group Analysis is used in practice for determining business strategies in a successful multinational firm.

She was the wife of Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski and a member of the influential &quot;Familia&quot; political party. She is also known for having founded Poland&#x27;s first museum, the Czartoryski Museum, now located in Kraków.

==Life==

She was the daughter of Count Georg Detlev von Flemming () and Princess Antonina Czartoryska.

On 18 November 1761, in Wołczyn, she married Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, thus becoming a princess. Her son Adam Jerzy Czartoryski wrote in his memoirs that prior to the marriage, Izabela fell ill with smallpox and that his aunt, Elżbieta Izabela Lubomirska, in horror at the bride&#x27;s pockmarked face, tried in vain to prevent the marriage to her brother. 

She was rumored to have had an affair with the Russian ambassador to Poland, Nikolai Vasilyevich Repnin, who was alleged to have fathered her son Adam George Czartoryski.

She had also an affair with the Duke de Lauzun, who says himself in his &quot;Mémoires&quot; he fathered her second son 
Konstanty Adam.

In Paris in 1772, she met Benjamin Franklin, subsequently a leader of the American Revolution, and the French philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire, who were bringing new ideas to the old order.

In 1775, together with her husband, Czartoryska completely transformed the Czartoryski Palace at Puławy into an intellectual and political meeting place. Her court was one of the most liberal and progressive in the Commonwealth, although some aspects of her behavior also caused scandals.

Izabela discovered the talent of the young painter Aleksander Orłowski and financed him.

While in Prussia with her daughter Maria Wirtemberska for the latter&#x27;s marriage, she told Frederick II of her fears that her husband would be poisoned, which was what had caused a split between him and Stanisław August Poniatowski politically. Frederick laughed and told her that only monarchs were poisoned, and spread the conversation around his court to Izabela&#x27;s detriment, according to Wirydianna Fiszerowa.

In 1784, she joined the Patriotic Party.

After the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising, her sons Adam George and Konstanty Adam were taken as political hostages by Russia&#x27;s Empress Catherine II.

In 1796, Izabela ordered the rebuilding of the ruined palace at Puławy and began a museum. Among the first objects to be included were Turkish trophies that had been seized by Polish King John III Sobieski&#x27;s forces at the 1683 Battle of Vienna. Also included were Polish royal treasures and historic Polish family heirlooms. In 1801 Izabela opened the Temple of the Sibyl, also called &quot;The Temple of Memory&quot;. It contained objects of sentimental importance pertaining to the glories and miseries of human life. During the November Uprising in 1830, the museum was closed. Izabela&#x27;s son Adam George Czartoryski, going into exile in Paris, evacuated the museum&#x27;s surviving objects to the Hôtel Lambert. His son Władysław Czartoryski would reopen the museum in 1878 in Kraków, where it exists today.

<doc id="1127452" wikidata="Q507697" url="?curid=1127452" title="Flowing Tears">
<text>Flowing Tears was a German gothic metal band founded in 2003 in Wadgassen. Their original name was Flowing Tears &amp; Withered Flowers, which they used for their first several releases. The band&#x27;s final lineup consisted of vocalist Helen Vogt, guitarist/keyboardist Benjamin Buss, bassist David Vogt and drummer Stefan Gemballa.

== History ==
=== 1994–1999: Formation and first albums ===
The band formed in 1994 under the moniker Flowing Tears &amp; Withered Flowers. Under the first name, they released a demo called Bijou in 1995, two full-length albums: &quot;Swansongs&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Joy Parade&quot; in 1998, and an EP named Swallow in 1999. On &quot;Swansongs&quot;, Manfred Bersin contributed the male vocals. After the EP&#x27;s release, the band abridged their name to &quot;Flowing Tears&quot;.

=== 2002–2004: &quot;Serpentine&quot; and vocalist change ===

With the release of &quot;Serpentine&quot; in 2002, the band would build on the work they did with &quot;Jade&quot;, adding a slightly more up tempo and a less melancholy sound. After the release of &quot;Serpentine&quot;, Stefanie Duchêne left the band for personal reasons. The replacement vocalist became Helen Vogt. With a sound similar to that of &quot;Serpentine&quot;, and Vogt&#x27;s vocal similarities with Stefanie Duchêne&#x27;s vocals, the band released their fifth studio album, &quot;Razorbliss&quot;.

The band toured with After Forever in April and May 2004. On 20 October 2004, just seven months after the release of &quot;Razorbliss&quot;, two founding members of Flowing Tears, Björn Lorson and Cristian Zimmer (the first of whom was still in the band&#x27;s lineup at the time), died in a car accident.

=== 2008–2014: &quot;Thy Kingdom Gone&quot; and a hiatus ===
October 2008 saw the release of Flowing Tears&#x27; sixth full-length album, &quot;Thy Kingdom Gone&quot;. It is a concept album containing 12 songs, along with artwork made by Seth Siro Anton, an artist who has done work for Moonspell, Soilwork, and Paradise Lost.

The band is on hiatus according to a Facebook status update in January 2013 by Helen Vogt, she expressed that she does wish to record a new album someday. However, she announced in March 2014 that &quot;Thy Kingdom Gone&quot; would be the band&#x27;s final album.

<doc id="1127456" wikidata="Q3318" url="?curid=1127456" title="Churchill River (Hudson Bay)">
<text>The Churchill River () is a major river in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. From the head of the Churchill Lake it is long. It was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company from 1685 to 1691. The Cree name for the river is &quot;Missinipi&quot;, meaning &quot;big waters&quot;. The Denesuline name for the river is &quot;des nëdhë́&quot;, meaning &quot;Great River&quot;.

The river is located entirely within the Canadian Shield. The drainage basin includes a number of lakes in Central-East Alberta which flow into a series of lakes in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The main tributary, Beaver River, joins at Lac Île-à-la-Crosse.

Nistowiak Falls — the tallest falls in Saskatchewan — are on the Rapid River, which flows north out of Lac la Ronge into Nistowiak Lake on the Churchill just north of La Ronge.

A large amount of flow of the Churchill River after the Manitoba — Saskatchewan border comes from the Reindeer River, which flows from Wollaston and Reindeer Lakes. Flow from Reindeer Lake is regulated by the Whitesand Dam. From there, the Churchill River flows east through a series of lakes (Highrock, Granville, Southern Indian and Gauer), then flows via a diversion for hydro-electric generation into the Nelson River (60% of flow), and the rest flows as the Churchill River into Hudson Bay at Churchill, Manitoba (see also Nelson River Hydroelectric Project).

== History ==
The Churchill formed a major part of the &quot;voyageur highway&quot; in the 18th to 20th centuries after Dene people showed Peter Pond the Methye Portage which connects the Hudson Bay watershed with the Clearwater — Athabasca — Mackenzie rivers which flow to the Arctic Ocean. See Canadian Canoe Routes (early).

== Fish species ==
The Churchill is also home of several fish species including: walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike, lake trout, lake whitefish, cisco, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, longnose sucker, lake sturgeon, and burbot.

== Hydroelectric developments ==

=== Island Falls ===
The only operating hydroelectric generating station on the Churchill River is Island Falls, with a capacity of 111 megawatts (MW). The purpose of the Whitesand Dam mentioned above is to control the amount of water flowing through Island Falls, since the generating station is downstream of the Reindeer River fork.

=== Wintego Hydroelectric Project ===
In the 1970s, SaskPower was considering building another hydroelectric station on the Churchill River called Wintego. This station would have been located about downstream of the Reindeer River forks, and upstream of Island Falls. The project was expected to cost $338 million (equivalent to $1.3 billion in 2020), including transmission and roads, and the capacity of the station would have been 300 MW.

The cost estimate assumes a 50-year lifespan, but the lifespans of SaskPower&#x27;s other hydroelectric stations have been proven to be much longer (such as 90 years for Island Falls). Construction of Wintego would also enable the output of Island Falls to increase by 70 MW, and this benefit is not included in the cost estimate above.

=== Other Saskatchewan ===
Two other potential hydroelectric developments between the Reindeer River Fork and Island Falls are the Iskwatam Generating Station and the Pita Generating Station, with unknown MW capacities.

=== Manitoba ===
In Manitoba, the Bonald and Granville Falls generating stations could produce 110 MW and 120 MW, respectively.

<doc id="1127460" wikidata="Q1752621" url="?curid=1127460" title="Sylvester's law of inertia">
<text>Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia is a theorem in matrix algebra about certain properties of the coefficient matrix of a real quadratic form that remain invariant under a change of basis. Namely, if formula_1 is a symmetric matrix, then for any invertible matrix formula_2, the number of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues (called the inertia of the matrix) of formula_3 is constant. This result is particularly useful when formula_4 is diagonal, as the inertia of a diagonal matrix can easily be obtained by looking at the sign of its diagonal elements.

This property is named after James Joseph Sylvester who published its proof in 1852.

== Statement ==
Let formula_1 be a symmetric square matrix of order formula_6 with real entries. Any non-singular matrix formula_2 of the same size is said to transform formula_1 into another symmetric matrix , also of order , where formula_9 is the transpose of . It is also said that matrices formula_1 and formula_11 are congruent. If formula_1 is the coefficient matrix of some quadratic form of , then formula_11 is the matrix for the same form after the change of basis defined by .

A symmetric matrix formula_1 can always be transformed in this way into a diagonal matrix 
formula_4 which has only entries , , along the diagonal. Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia states that the number of diagonal entries of each kind is an invariant of , i.e. it does not depend on the matrix formula_2 used.

The number of s, denoted , is called the positive index of inertia of , and the number of s, denoted , is called the negative index of inertia. The number of s, denoted , is the dimension of the null space of , known as the nullity of . These numbers satisfy an obvious relation
: formula_17

The difference, , is usually called the signature of . (However, some authors use that term for the triple 
formula_18 consisting of the nullity and the positive and negative indices of inertia of ; for a non-degenerate form of a given dimension these are equivalent data, but in general the triple yields more data.)

If the matrix formula_1 has the property that every principal upper left formula_20 minor formula_21 is non-zero then the negative index of inertia is equal to the number of sign changes in the sequence
: formula_22

== Statement in terms of eigenvalues ==
The law can also be stated as follows: two symmetric square matrices of the same size have the same number of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues if and only if they are congruent (, for some non-singular ).

The positive and negative indices of a symmetric matrix formula_1 are also the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of . Any symmetric real matrix formula_1 has an eigendecomposition of the form formula_25 where formula_26 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of , and formula_27 is an orthonormal square matrix containing the eigenvectors. The matrix formula_26 can be written formula_29 where formula_4 is diagonal with entries , and formula_31 is diagonal with . The matrix formula_32 transforms formula_4 to .

== Law of inertia for quadratic forms ==
In the context of quadratic forms, a real quadratic form formula_27 in formula_6 variables (or on an formula_6-dimensional real vector space) can by a suitable change of basis (by non-singular linear transformation from formula_37 to ) be brought to the diagonal form
: formula_38
with each formula_39. Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia states that the number of coefficients of a given sign is an invariant of , i.e., does not depend on a particular choice of diagonalizing basis. Expressed geometrically, the law of inertia says that all maximal subspaces on which the restriction of the quadratic form is positive definite (respectively, negative definite) have the same dimension. These dimensions are the positive and negative indices of inertia.

== Generalizations ==
Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia is also valid if formula_1 and formula_11 have complex entries. In this case, it is said that formula_1 and formula_11 are formula_44-congruent if and only if there exists a non-singular complex matrix formula_2 such that , where formula_44 denotes the conjugate transpose. In the complex scenario, a way to state Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia is that if formula_1 and formula_11 are Hermitian matrices, then formula_1 and formula_11 are formula_44-congruent if and only if they have the same inertia, the definition of which is still valid as the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices are always real numbers. 

Ostrowski proved a quantitative generalization of Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia: if formula_1 and formula_11 are formula_44-congruent with , then their eigenvalues formula_55 are related by 
formula_56 
where formula_57 are such that . 

A theorem due to Ikramov generalizes the law of inertia to any normal matrices formula_1 and : If formula_1 and formula_11 are normal matrices, then formula_1 and formula_11 are congruent if and only if they have the same number of eigenvalues on each open ray from the origin in the complex plane.

<text>Angus Eve (born 23 February 1972) is a Trinidadian former professional footballer who was most recently the head coach of the Trinidad and Tobago national team. With 117 caps he is his country&#x27;s most capped player of all time.

==Playing career==
Eve played with Joe Public of Trinidad, on loan from Chester City of England. Eve is Chester&#x27;s most capped player, although many of his caps were won while out on loan and he only made 14 Football League appearances for Chester in the 1999–2000 season. They were relegated at the end of the season, with Eve missing several games because of international duty.

Eve made his debut for the Trinidad and Tobago national team in a 4 April 1994 Copa Caribe game against Barbados. He went on to become a monumental figure for the national team. He earned 117 caps in those years, scoring 34 goals, and helped lead the team in three different rounds of World Cup qualifiers. He retired from international football after not being considered for the Trinidad and Tobago squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Eve joined San Juan Jabloteh prior to the 2001 Trinidad season as a defender.

==Managerial career==
Eve was an assistant coach at San Juan Jabloteh, working with former England international Terry Fenwick. In April 2009 he joined Ma Pau Stars as the assistant coach.

On 26 May 2011, he was appointed manager for the Trinidad and Tobago U23 for the Olympic Qualifiers that were played in July 2011.

On 15 June 2021, Eve was appointed interim head coach of the Trinidad and Tobago national team following the dismissal of Fenwick who failed to guide the team past the first round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification. He was officially named head coach of the national team as well as the Trinidad and Tobago U20 on 2 September 2021. Eve left the job on 31 July 2024.

<text>General elections were held in Guam on November 2, 2004 in order to elect all 15 members of the legislature, the federal delegate, mayors of 14 cities, vice mayors of three cities, the public auditor, the Consolidated Commission on Utilities, two judges of the Superior Court, running for retention and the Guam Public Education Policy Board. Voters also voted on the President of the United States although the territory sent no representatives to the electoral college. There was also a referendum on allowing gambling, which was rejected by voters.

==Background==
In the United States territory of Guam, elections to the Legislature and multi-member boards are run via open primary (This following the outlawing of the previous blanket primary similar to Louisiana).

Both the Public Auditor and Consolidated Commission on Utilities are required to be nonpartisan and as such candidates are not allowed to state affiliations or list them on the ballot.

In the case of the Auditor, affiliating with a party is grounds for disqualification.

==Campaign==
A total of 30 candidates ran for 15 seats in the Legislature, with both the Democratic and Republican parties nominating a full slate.

The Guam Bar Association conducted an internal survey to determine feelings towards the two judges running for retention. Both were given strong marks of approval by the less than 100 members.

During the run-up, &quot;Proposition A&quot;, the gaming/gambling legalization measure received significant coverage. A group called &quot;Citizens for Economic Diversity&quot; proposed it.

==Legislative candidates==
===Democratic candidates===
* Frank B. Aguon Jr. (I)

* Ray Tenorio
* Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; R. Unpingco

===Declined===
* Dr. Carmen Fernandez (D)

==Results==

===President of the United States===
Despite not having any electoral votes, Guam approved of George W. Bush by 64% over John Kerry. Ralph Nader and Michael Badnarik both received less than one percent.




===Delegate===


===Legislature===
In the election to the legislature, the top fifteen vote-getters are elected, and the remaining candidates aren&#x27;t. A recount was held due to the closeness of the vote counts of the critical 15th/16th candidates. As a result, Joanne Brown (Republican), an incumbent, pushed then Speaker Ben Pangelinan into 16th place with a two-vote lead.













===Auditor===


===Utilities Commission===



===Judicial retention===
Both judges standing for retention kept their seats by large majorities.

===Education board===
Elections for the Guam Education Policy Board suffered for a shortage of candidates: Only in the district of Luchan were there more running then returned (4, including write-in, for two seats). In the other two 2 seat districts, the second had to be filled by write-in, and in the 3 seat Lagu district, NO candidates were on the ballot, resulting in a 100% write-in return.

===Mayors===
Ten Republican mayors were elected against four Democratic mayors and all three vice mayors. The vice mayor of Barrigada, June Blas was elected without opposition.

===Referendum===

<doc id="1127485" wikidata="Q360524" url="?curid=1127485" title="Bert Patenaude">
<text>Bertrand &quot;Bert&quot; Arthur Patenaude (; November 4, 1909November 4, 1974) was an American soccer player who played as a forward. Although it was formerly disputed, he is officially credited by FIFA as the scorer of the first hat-trick in World Cup history. He is a member of the United States Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Club career==
Born in Massachusetts in 1909, Patenaude began playing in the competitive local leagues in his hometown of Fall River, Massachusetts. In 1928, he signed his first professional contract with Philadelphia Field Club of the American Soccer League. In his eight games with Philadelphia, he scored six goals. Despite this productivity, he moved to J&amp;P Coats for one league game, then moved again to his hometown Fall River F.C. While playing with the &#x27;Marksmen&#x27;, Patenaude formed a lethal striking partnership with another local Massachusetts player, Billy Gonsalves (scoring 112 goals in 114 appearances with the Massachusetts club). He remained in Fall River until the summer of 1930, winning the 1930 National Challenge Cup before moving to the Newark Americans. He scored seven goals in five games at the start of the 1930–1931 season, but found himself back with the &#x27;Marksmen&#x27; for the end of the season. In 1931, Fall River merged with the New York Soccer Club to form the New York Yankees. However, Fall River had already begun playing National Cup games. Therefore, while the Yankees won the National Cup, the records show the winner as Fall River. In the cup championship, Patenaude scored five goals in the Yankees&#x27; 6–2 first game victory over Chicago&#x27;s Bricklayers and Masons F.C. Patenaude remained with the Yankees through the spring of 1931. That same year, the Yankees moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where the team took up the name of the defunct New Bedford Whalers.

The ASL was collapsing by the fall of 1931 and records are incomplete, but it appears that in 1933, Patenaude signed with the Philadelphia German-Americans of the second American Soccer League. In 1934, Patenaude moved west to sign with St. Louis Central Breweries of the St. Louis Soccer League, at that point the only professional league in the country. Central Breweries, stocked with future Hall of Famers, won the league and 1935 National Challenge Cup titles. In 1935, Central Breweries left the league, became an independent team and lost the sponsorship of the brewery. Patenaude remained with the team, now called the St. Louis Shamrocks. In 1936, the Shamrocks went to the National Cup final before falling to the Philadelphia German-Americans.

In 1936, Patenaude returned east where he played one season with Philadelphia Passon of the ASL before he disappeared from the professional scene. Patenaude returned to Fall River and worked in painting and carpentry until his death in 1974.

==International career==
In 1930, Patenaude was called into the U.S. national team for the 1930 FIFA World Cup. In that cup, he scored a goal in the U.S. opener against Belgium, then a hat trick in the 3–0 victory over Paraguay. Following the U.S. elimination by Argentina in the semifinals, the U.S. went on an exhibition tour of South America, ending with a 4–3 loss to Brazil in which Patenaude scored his sixth and final U.S. goal and never again appeared with the national setup.

Patenaude&#x27;s record of four goals in one World Cup remains the standard for an American player. Additionally, his total stood as the all-time career mark for an American player until Landon Donovan notched his third, fourth, and fifth career World Cup goals at the 2010 edition.

===World Cup hat-trick===
Patenaude&#x27;s historic day came on July 17, 1930, as the United States played Paraguay in the inaugural World Cup. Patenaude scored the opening goal in the tenth minute. A second goal in the fifteenth minute had been credited several different ways: as an own goal by Aurelio González (according to the RSSSF), a regular goal by the U.S.&#x27;s Tom Florie (according to the official FIFA match record), or as Patenaude&#x27;s second goal (according to the United States Soccer Federation). A fiftieth-minute goal by Patenaude gave the U.S. a 3–0 win over the South Americans.

The dispute and discrepancies over the second goal had led to confusion over the first-ever World Cup hat-trick, as Argentina&#x27;s Guillermo Stábile scored one against Mexico just two days after the U.S.-Paraguay game. FIFA announced on November 10, 2006, that Patenaude was the first person to score a hat-trick in World Cup play, confirming that he scored all three goals.

Patenaude was inducted into the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame in 1971. He died in Fall River on his sixty-fifth birthday.

<doc id="1127490" wikidata="Q1067743" url="?curid=1127490" title="Sporopollenin">
<text>Sporopollenin is a biological polymer found as a major component of the tough outer (exine) walls of plant spores and pollen grains. It is chemically very stable (one of the most inert among biopolymers) and is usually well preserved in soils and sediments. The exine layer is often intricately sculptured in species-specific patterns, allowing material recovered from (for example) lake sediments to provide useful information to palynologists about plant and fungal populations in the past. Sporopollenin has found uses in the field of paleoclimatology as well. Sporopollenin is also found in the cell walls of several taxa of green alga, including &quot;Phycopeltis&quot; (an ulvophycean) and &quot;Chlorella&quot;.

Spores are dispersed by many different environmental factors, such as wind, water or animals. In suitable conditions, the sporopollenin-rich walls of pollen grains and spores can persist in the fossil record for hundreds of millions of years, since sporopollenin is resistant to chemical degradation by organic and inorganic chemicals.

== Chemical composition ==
The chemical composition of sporopollenin has long been elusive due to its unusual chemical stability, insolubility and resistance to degradation by enzymes and strong chemical reagents. It was once thought to consist of polymerised carotenoids but the application of more detailed analytical methods since the 1980s has shown that this is not correct. Analyses have revealed a complex biopolymer, containing mainly long-chain fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics and traces of carotenoids in a random co-polymer. It is likely that sporopollenin derives from several precursors that are chemically cross-linked to form a rigid structure. There is also good evidence that the chemical composition of sporopollenin is not the same in all plants, indicating it is a class of compounds rather than having one constant structure.

In 2019, thioacidolysis degradation and solid-state NMR was used to determine the molecular structure of pitch pine sporopollenin, finding it primarily composed of polyvinyl alcohol units alongside other aliphatic monomers, all crosslinked through a series of acetal linkages. Its complex and heterogeneous chemical structure give some protection from the biodegradative enzymes of bacteria, fungi and animals. Some aromatic structures based on &quot;p&quot;-coumarate and naringenin were also identified within the sporopollenin polymer. These can absorb ultraviolet light and thus prevent it penetrating further into the spore. This has relevance to the role of pollen and spores in transporting and dispersing the gametes of plants. The DNA of the gametes is readily damaged by the ultraviolet component of daylight. Sporopollenin thus provides some protection from this damage as well as a physically robust container.

Analysis of sporopollenin from the clubmoss &quot;Lycopodium&quot; in the late 1980s have shown distinct structural differences from that of flowering plants. In 2020, more detailed analysis of sporopollenin from &quot;Lycopodium clavatum&quot; provided more structural information. It showed a complete lack of aromatic structures and the presence of a macrocyclic backbone of polyhydroxylated tetraketide-like monomers with pseudo-aromatic 2-pyrone rings. These were crosslinked to a poly(hydroxy acid) chain by ether linkages to form the polymer.

==Biosynthesis==
Electron microscopy shows that the tapetal cells that surround the developing pollen grain in the anther have a highly active secretory system containing lipophilic globules. These globules are believed to contain sporopollenin precursors. Tracer experiments have shown that phenylalanine is a major precursor, but other carbon sources also contribute. The biosynthetic pathway for phenylpropanoid is very active in tapetal cells, supporting the idea that its products are needed for sporopollenin synthesis. Chemical inhibitors of pollen development and many male sterile mutants have effects on the secretion of these globules by the tapetal cells.

<text>Frank Zane (born June 28, 1942) is a retired American professional bodybuilder and author. Known as &quot;The Chemist&quot;, Zane is a three-time Mr. Olympia winner, having won the competition every year from 1977 to 1979. He previously reigned as Mr. Universe in 1965, 1968, 1970, 1971 and 1972, and Mr. America in 1966, 1967 and 1968. Typically competing at a bodyweight of less than 200lbs, he regularly placed higher than people much bigger than him. His physique is considered one of the greatest in the history of bodybuilding due to his meticulous focus on symmetry and proportion. With one of the smallest, tightest waists in bodybuilding, he was renowned for his vacuum pose. 

Since his retirement from competitive bodybuilding in 1983, Zane has written several books on bodybuilding, operates a fitness mail order business, and teaches the &quot;Zane Experience&quot; program to clients. He was inducted in the IFBB Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Biography==
Zane was born in Kingston, Pennsylvania on June 28, 1942. He started bodybuilding as a teenager after reading &quot;Muscle Magazine&quot;. He went from at 14 to at 17 through weightlifting. In 1964, he received a Bachelor of Science from Wilkes University. For 13 years, he taught mathematics and chemistry while living in Florida and California. He also taught mathematics and chemistry at Watchung Hills Regional High School (in New Jersey) for the 1965–1966 school year. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from California State University, Los Angeles in 1977. Zane was awarded a master&#x27;s degree in experimental psychology from California State University, San Bernardino in 1992.

=== Bodybuilding career ===
Zane is a three-time Mr. Olympia (1977 to 1979). His reign represented a shift in emphasis from mass to aesthetics. Zane&#x27;s physique featured the second-thinnest waistline of all the Mr. Olympias (after Sergio Oliva), with his wide shoulders making for a distinctive V-taper. He stood at and had a competition weight of less than 190 pounds when he won all three of his Mr. Olympias. He was given the nickname &quot;The Chemist&quot; due to his Bachelor of Science degree and, as he puts it: &quot;Back in the day I took a lot of supplements and tons of amino acids. Still do. But back then it was pretty unusual. That&#x27;s how I got the nickname The Chemist.&quot;

He famously trained with light weights which saw him to many victories, but Joe Weider urged him to train with heavier weights. Zane then found the size necessary for success at the Olympia. After his three consecutive Mr. Olympia titles came the 1980 Mr. Olympia. Shortly before the competition he suffered a poolside accident in his home and lost of muscle mass. This ended his reign. Arnold Schwarzenegger came out of retirement and won, with Zane in third; the outcome was highly controversial.

Zane is one of only three men to have defeated Schwarzenegger (with Chester Yorton and Sergio Oliva) in a bodybuilding contest and one of the very few Mr. Olympia winners under . Overall, he competed for over 20 years (retiring after the 1983 Mr. Olympia) and won Mr. America, Mr. Universe, Mr. World, and Mr. Olympia during his career.

In 1985, Frank and his wife Christine owned and operated &quot;Zane Haven&quot; in Palm Springs, California where they conducted one-on-one sessions with clients who wished to possess a symmetrical physique. Today, the Zanes live in San Diego, California, and his learning center is now called &quot;Zane Experience&quot;. He is the founder of Zane Gallery in Laguna Beach, CA which features bodybuilding art and photography and is dedicated to bringing Golden Era Bodybuilding back into the mainstream. In addition to this, he operates a commerce site selling books, supplements and training equipment.

In 1994, Zane was inducted into the Joe Weider Hall of Fame. Since 1998, Zane has written a newsletter entitled &quot;Frank Zane Newsletter&quot;, that provides the latest information in all aspects of bodybuilding. He received the Arnold Schwarzenegger Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2003 Arnold Classic for his dedication and longtime support of the sport.

In 2005, Zane played the IFBB Announcer and worked as the consulting producer in the movie &quot;See Arnold Run&quot;. , Zane runs his own website, and appears at seminars and book signings. In 2011, Frank Zane appeared in the documentary &quot;Challenging Impossibility&quot; describing the weightlifting odyssey of spiritual teacher and peace advocate Sri Chinmoy. The film was an official selection of the 2011 Tribeca Festival.

In June 2020, Frank Zane began filming a feature documentary on his life directed and produced by filmmaker Alex Ardenti.

<text>Beaumont-le-Roger () is a commune in the department of Eure in Normandy region in northern France.

==Geography==
The commune is located in the valley of the Risle on the edge of the forest with which it shares its name. It is crossed by the Paris-Cherbourg railway line, on which it has a station. The Beaumont forest covers four communes; it is the largest private forest in Normandy.

The commune along with another 69 communes shares part of a 4,747 hectare, Natura 2000 conservation area, called Risle, Guiel, Charentonne.

==History==
Humphrey (or Honfroy, Onfroi or Umfrid) de Vieilles (died c. 1044) was the first holder of the &quot;grand honneur&quot; of Beaumont-le-Roger, one of the most important groups of domains in eastern Normandy and the founder of the House of Beaumont. He was married to Albreda or Alberée de la Haye Auberie. His son, Roger de Beaumont, a powerful 11th century lord and adviser to William the Conqueror, derived his family name from Beaumont, of which his family were lords.

<doc id="1127509" wikidata="Q17120610" url="?curid=1127509" title="Tuple-versioning">
<text>Tuple-versioning (also called point-in-time) is a mechanism used in a relational database management system to store past states of a relation. Normally, only the current state is captured.

Using tuple-versioning techniques, typically two values for time are stored along with each tuple: a start time and an end time. These two values indicate the validity of the rest of the values in the tuple.

Typically when tuple-versioning techniques are used, the current tuple has a valid start time, but a null value for end time. Therefore, it is easy and efficient to obtain the current values for all tuples by querying for the null end time.

A single query that searches for tuples with start time less than, and end time greater than, a given time (where null end time is treated as a value greater than the given time) will give as a result the valid tuples at the given time.

For example, if a person&#x27;s job changes from Engineer to Manager, there would be two tuples in an Employee table, one with the value Engineer for job and the other with the value Manager for job. The end time for the Engineer tuple would be equal to the start time for the Manager tuple.

The pattern known as log trigger uses this technique to automatically store historical information of a table in a database.

<text>Defence Force Football Club is a football club based in Chaguaramas, Trinidad and Tobago that currently plays in the country&#x27;s TT Premier Football League. The team plays its home games in Hasely Crawford Stadium in Mucurapo, Trinidad.

==History==

Founded in 1974, Defence Force F.C. is the nation&#x27;s most successful football club, winning 20 national championships. They won 15 titles in twenty-two seasons in the National League from 1974 to 1995, two titles in the Semi-Professional League between 1996 and 1998, and three championships since the Trinidad and Tobago league became professional in 1999 with the Pro League. They are also the only team from Trinidad and Tobago to have ever won the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, having won titles in 1978 and 1985. In 1985, Defense Force achieved the treble, winning the National League, FA Trophy, and CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. They are one of only three teams in the CONCACAF Federation to have achieved this feat, along with Cruz Azul and Monterrey and the only CONCACAF club outside of Mexico.

Since the club is composed of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s protective forces, they are named Defence Force F.C. Usually included are officers, soldiers, and sailors from the Trinidad and Tobago Army and Coast Guard.

A four-time winner of the Ronde van Nederland, he also rode the Tour de France 11 times between 1974 and 1987, winning 10 stages, a Dutch record equalled only by Jan Raas and Joop Zoetemelk. Knetemann won 127 races as a professional.

Knetemann maintained an Amsterdam accent and a sharp sense of humour that made him a favourite with reporters and earned him television and radio appearances. His best year in the Tour de France was 1978, when he led from the sixth stage. Although he lost the leader&#x27;s yellow jersey two days later, he won the stage into Lausanne and then the final stage on the Champs Elysées in Paris.

Together with Raas and his TI-Raleigh teammates Knetemann played a pivotal role in the victory of Zoetemelk in the 1980 Tour de France, one of the most dominating team performances in Tour de France history in which the team won twelve stages.

His career dwindled after a crash in Dwars door België in Belgium in March 1983. 

Recovery took months and, although he did again ride the Tour de France, there was not much left of the once sparkling star. Knetemann did however win the Amstel Gold Race in 1985. He retired from racing in 1991 and became Dutch team selector.

Knetemann died while riding his bike. He collapsed from a heart attack with friends in De Schoorlse Duinen in Schoorl (gem. Bergen)

His wife, Gre Donker, was also a racing cyclist. They had a son and two daughters. Their daughter Roxane, born in 1987, was a professional cyclist as well.

== Teams ==

Knetemann raced for several different sponsored teams in his career, one of the most famous was the team, managed by Peter Post, with which he won the 1978 UCI Road World Championships.

<doc id="1127521" wikidata="Q15274532" url="?curid=1127521" title="1982 Salang Tunnel fire">
<text>The 1982 Salang Tunnel fire occurred on 3 November 1982 in Afghanistan&#x27;s Salang Tunnel during the Soviet–Afghan War. Details are uncertain and officially the number of casualties was recorded as between 168–176 Soviet and Afghan soldiers and civilians. Despite this, contemporary Western media said the incident may have been the deadliest known road accident, and one of the deadliest fires of modern times, with the death toll estimated at 2,700 people, including 700 Soviet soldiers.

== Background ==
The Salang Tunnel, which allows motor traffic to bypass the infamous Salang Pass (or Kotal-e Salang), was completed by Soviet engineers in 1964 and is of major strategic importance.

Prior to the 1982 fire, on 23 February 1980, carbon monoxide buildup killed 16 Soviet soldiers in the Salang Tunnel.

== Fire ==
Very few facts are known about the fire. All information available constitutes little more than hearsay, in part because the Soviet Army was not inclined to reveal massive losses during wartime. Neither the Soviet nor Afghan governments confirmed any incident occurred. Most sources agree that it involved a Soviet Army convoy traveling southward through the tunnel.

According to Soviet Army records, on 3 November 1982, two military convoys (2211 and 2212) collided in the Salang tunnel causing a traffic jam, but no fire or explosion.

== Victims ==
Initial reports described fuel and ordnance explosions, and estimates of the death toll were as high as 2,700. Shortly after the event, Western diplomats indicated that a collision with a fuel truck initiated the fire in the tunnel that led to the catastrophe, resulting in the death of as many as 700 Soviet soldiers and 400 to 2,000 Afghan civilians. People died either from fire or smoke inhalation. The death toll was subsequently revised downwards by the Soviet government many times. Fifty-six to 64 Soviet soldiers and 112 Afghans were killed by carbon monoxide emitted by idling engines.

== Response ==
Afghan insurgents said they did not have any role in the explosion in the tunnel.

<doc id="1127523" wikidata="Q700779" url="?curid=1127523" title="Michał Fryderyk Czartoryski">
<text>Prince Michał Fryderyk Czartoryski (1696–1775) was a Polish nobleman, the Duke of Klewań and , magnate, and Knight of the Order of the White Eagle (from 1726). He headed Poland&#x27;s Czartoryski &quot;Familia&quot;.

He served as Steward of Lithuania from 1720, Castellan of Vilnius from 1722, Grand Chancellor of Lithuania from 1752, and Starost of Grod, Luck, Uświat, Jurbol, Homel, Kupsk and Pienian.

==Biography==
Czartoryski was born in 1696 in Klewań, Poland. After an education on the French model, which he completed at Paris, Florence and Rome, he attached himself to the court of Dresden, and through the influence of Count Fleming, the leading minister there, obtained the vice-chancellorship of Lithuania and many other dignities. Czartoryski was one of the many Polish nobles who, when Augustus II was seriously ill at Białystok in 1727, signed the secret declaration guaranteeing the Polish succession to his son; but this did not prevent him from repudiating his obligations when Stanisław Leszczyński was placed upon the throne by the influence of France in 1733. When Stanislaus abdicated in 1735, Czartoryski voted for Augustus III of Saxony, who gladly employed him and his family to counteract the influence of competing factions.

For the next forty years Czartoryski was the leading Polish statesman. In foreign affairs he was the first to favour an alliance with Russia, Austria and England, as opposed to France and Prussia—a system difficult to sustain and not always beneficial to Poland or Saxony. In Poland Czartoryski was at the head of the party of reform. His palace was the place where the most promising young gentlemen of the day were educated and sent abroad that they might return as his coadjutors in his work. His plan aimed at the restoration of the royal prerogative and the abolition of the &quot;liberum veto&quot;, which made any durable improvement impossible. These patriotic endeavours made the Czartoryskis very unpopular with the &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility), but for many years they had the firm and constant support of the Saxon court, especially after Brühl succeeded Fleming.

Czartoryski reached the height of his power in 1752 when he was entrusted with the Great Seal of Lithuania, but after that date the influence of his rival Mniszek began to prevail at Dresden, whereupon Czartoryski sought a reconciliation with his political opponents at home and foreign support both in England and Russia. In 1755 he sent his nephew Stanisław Poniatowski to Saint Petersburg as Saxon minister, a mission which failed completely. Czartoryski&#x27;s pro-Russian policy had by this time estranged Brühl, but he frustrated all the plans of the Saxon court by dissolving the diets of 1760, 1761 and 1762. In 1763 he went a step further and proposed the dethronement of Augustus III, who however died the same year.

During the ensuing interregnum, the prince chancellor worked at the convocation diet of 1764 to reform the constitution, and it was with displeasure that he saw his nephew Stanisław finally elected king Stanisław II August in 1765. But though disgusted with the weakness of the king and obliged to abandon at last all hope of the amelioration of his country, Czartoryski continued to hold office till the last, and as chancellor of Lithuania he sealed all the partition treaties.

Czartoryski died in the full possession of his faculties and was considered by the Russian minister Repnin &quot;the soundest head in the kingdom.&quot; He was not the sole reforming statesman of his day, and despite his services there were occasions when the partisan in him got the better of the statesman. His foreign policy, moreover, was vacillating, and he changed his &quot;system&quot; frequently.

==Family==
Prince Michał Czartoryski married Countess Elenora Monika Waldstein on 30 October 1726 in Prague. They had four children (three daughters, one son):
* Antonina (1728 - 26 February 1746, Warsaw), who married Jerzy Detloff Flemming on 13 February 1744 in Warsaw.
* Konstancja (1729-1749), second wife of Jerzy Flemming.
* Aleksandra (1730-1798)
* Antoni (1732-1753)

<text>Drayton Plains is an unincorporated community in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Waterford Township. As an unincorporated community, Drayton Plains has no legally defined area or population statistics of its own. It once had its own post office with the 48020 ZIP Code but now uses the 48329 Waterford ZIP Code. It is located on Dixie Highway near the west end of Loon Lake.

==First Settlers==
In 1818, the United States General Land Office opened in Detroit offering land for $2.00 an acre. Horatio Foster, Jonathan Perry, and brothers Harvey and Austin Durfee were among the first to take advantage of the opportunity to become land owners in the wilderness north of Detroit.

In 1822, Horatio Foster and his wife were the first to settle in what would become Drayton Plains, although just temporarily as they moved northward a few years later where they permanently settled. In 1823, the first to establish permanent homes in Drayton Plains were Jonathan Perry, Harvey Durfee and Austin Durfee.

In 1825, the Erie Canal opened, linking the waters of Lake Erie in the west to the Hudson River in the east. The canal made travelling from the east easier, which resulted in an influx of settlers moving into the Michigan Territory.

In 1829, construction began on a road north from Detroit along the Saginaw Trail, allowing for easier passage into the wilderness north of the city.

In 1835, Daniel Windiate emigrated from Berkshire, England to what soon would be called Drayton Plains. There, he built a dam and mill and named the mill Drayton after his England home, Drayton. He died in Drayton Plains in 1843.

Drayton Plains was informally referred to as a village and maintained its own identity and post office beginning on February 4, 1835. The first post office was on Mill Street (later Hatchery Road).

In 1837, Michigan became the 26th State, thus attracting settlers by the score.

In 1838, the first burial took place at Drayton Plains Cemetery (located on Walton Blvd. and Williams Lake Road). The six-week-old infant son of Daniel and Martha Windiate was laid to rest there.

In 1839, the Drayton Plains Hotel was built by Daniel Windiate along the Saginaw Trail (later Dixie Highway), across from Sashabaw Road.

==Early development==
In 1850, the railroad was completed through Drayton Plains and a train depot was built in 1908 at Mill Street (now Hatchery Rd.) and Saginaw Trail. The Drayton Plains depot was built by the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway. The railroad was responsible for the population of Waterford Township reaching 1,085 the year it opened.

Drayton Plains was platted in 1860. In that year the town was laid out by Lewis L. Dunlap.

By 1860, the population of Waterford Township had climbed to 1,289. As Drayton Plains continued to grow, more retail establishments began to open. 
In 1865, John Linabury built the first stable in Drayton Plains and the first cider mill was built in the 1860s by John Kirodot.

Other business owners in Drayton Plains in 1872 included:
*C.B. Albertson, the first railroad station agent
*John Ebner, farmer and stock raiser 
*H.D. Judd, grist mill proprietor
*A.A. Southard, general farmer
*Paul Shwesinger, merchant &amp; manufacturer of boots and shoes and dealer in general merchandise.
*Moses Southard, blacksmith 
*James Swartz, manufacturer of boots and shoes and sold general merchandise in his store.

William Besley (or Beasley), son-in-law of Daniel Windiate, owned a general store, which also later served as a post office, election hall, Sunday school and Saturday night dance hall. It even housed Meinrad Hangee&#x27;s tin shop, and block ice was cut from Loon Lake by Pittman and Dean Ice House and sold throughout the area.

Early pioneers owning land tracts in Drayton Plains in 1872 include:

*C. B. Albertson
*Henry L. Birge (b.1816-d.1912)
*Andrew Cutchler (b.1803-d.1879)
*G. Deming
*Solomon G. Eagle (b.1817-d.1890)
*John M. Fair (b.1803-d.1884)
*Daniel M. Judd (b.1818-d.1877)
*John Linabury
*Oliver H.P. Osmun (b.1826-d.1907)
*Moses Southard
*H. E. Stowell 
*Matilda Van Campen (b.1817-d.1879)
*William Van Ostrand
*William K. Van Sykle (b.1818-d.1880?)
*Beeckman Van Zandt (b.1808-d.1881)
*Peter Wager (b.1810-d.1876)

Many of Drayton Plains&#x27; streets were named after local pioneers such as Denby, Covert, Frembes, Linabury, Meinrad, Van Syckle and Van Zandt.

==Schools==
The first school in Drayton Plains was built around 1865. The one-room wooden school was located at Monroe Street and Sashabaw Road in Drayton Plains, and was in use until 1920, when a new Drayton Plains School was built at the same Monroe Street and Sashabaw Road site. The first teacher at the school was Lewis M. Covert. The school was moved to The Pine Grove Historical Museum in Pontiac, Michigan and is open for tours.

High school students in Drayton Plains would ride the train from the depot to Pontiac High School, as Drayton Plains students were assigned to Pontiac High School in the early years.
In 1961, Kettering High School was opened on Bender Street in Drayton Plains (now Waterford Township).

In 1957, John D. Pierce Junior High School opened on Hatchery Road in Drayton Plains, and Stevens T. Mason Junior High School was opened in 1965 on Walton Blvd. in Drayton Plains.

Drayton Plains feeder elementary schools for the junior high schools included Drayton Plains Elementary School, George C. McVittie Elementary School on Midland Avenue, David Grayson Elementary School on Walton Blvd., Thomas M. Cooley Elementary School on Highfield Road, John Monteith Elementary School on Crescent Lake Road and Frank Manley Elementary School on Van Zandt Road

==Fish Hatchery and Nature Center==
A fish hatchery was opened by the state in Drayton Plains in 1903 along the Clinton River on Mill Street (later Hatchery Road). The hatchery was originally known as the Drayton Plains Station. Its purpose was to raise bass fingerlings. Starting around 1913, the Drayton Plains Station began to be informally called the Drayton Plains Hatchery. By 1934, the name was officially changed to Drayton Plains State Fish Hatchery and remained thus until its closing in 1962.

The Drayton Plains State Fish Hatchery was listed as a Michigan Historic Site on August 24, 1984.

Today, the former fish hatchery is the site of the Drayton Plains Nature Center, located at 2125 Denby. Situated on 138 acres, with an expanse of nearly one mile in length, it exhibits nature in various forms. The grounds include woods, ponds, streams and a prairie. Along with expansive trails, it offers an interpretive center that houses displays of specimens in their natural habitat.

==20th-century development==
As the 20th century began, the Drayton Plains train depot was opened. Built in 1908 by the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway, a subsidiary of the Grand Trunk Railroad, the depot stood on the northeast corner of Mill Street and Saginaw Trail (situated on the south side of the tracks).

The depot was closed in 1957 and was demolished in 1965. A replica of the depot was built in 1995 and it stands at the Waterford Historical Society.
In 1929, the Community Presbyterian church was opened at 4301 Monroe Avenue near Sashabaw Road.

The Drayton Theater, built in the 1940s, was the only movie theater in Drayton Plains. It was located on Dixie Highway between Sashabaw Road and Monroe Street.

In 1942, the Drayton Men&#x27;s Club developed Drayton Ball Park at Dixie Highway and Sashabaw Road. The ballpark is still in operation today as Shell Park.

When zip codes were introduced in 1963, Drayton Plains&#x27; zip code became 48020.

By the end of the 20th Century, the population of Waterford Township, Michigan was 73,150.

==Dissolution==
The Drayton Plains post office was permanently closed on January 31, 2004. At the same time, all of its functions were transferred to the Waterford Post Office. The zip code for the community became 48329 and its identity has been largely subsumed within that of Waterford Charter Township.

<doc id="1127526" wikidata="Q378334" url="?curid=1127526" title="Roger De Vlaeminck">
<text>Roger De Vlaeminck (; born 24 August 1947) is a Belgian former professional racing cyclist. He was described by Rik Van Looy as &quot;The most talented and the only real classics rider of his generation&quot;. Nicknamed &quot;The Gypsy&quot; because he was born into a family of traveling clothiers, he is known for exploits in the cobbled classic Paris–Roubaix race, but his performances in other &quot;Monument&quot; races gave him a record that few can match. His record in Paris–Roubaix earned him another nickname, &quot;Monsieur Paris–Roubaix&quot;.

==Early life and amateur career==
De Vlaeminck was born on 24 August 1947 in the East Flanders town of Eeklo, His first love was football. At the age of 16 he debuted for F.C. Eeklo. He could have made a career in the sport, however his elder brother Erik was having success as a pro cyclist and this persuaded Roger to try cycling. He raced as a junior in 1965, gaining one win, but 1966 saw 25 victories. Roger and Erik spent their winters riding cyclo-cross. In Luxembourg in 1968, Erik became world professional champion and Roger the amateur champion on the same day. Roger eventually took the professional title in 1975.

In 1968 De Vlaeminck rode the road race at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico and finished 18th.

==Professional career==

De Vlaeminck turned professional at the start of the 1969 season with Flandria-Declerck and won the Omloop &quot;Het Volk&quot; in his first race. De Vlaeminck&#x27;s career ran parallel with Eddy Merckx and he battled for ascendancy with Merckx throughout his career. De Vlaeminck rode Paris–Roubaix on 14 occasions, winning four times (1972, 1974, 1975, 1977), finished second four times, third once, fifth once, sixth once, seventh twice and abandoned only in 1980. His skills as a cyclo-cross rider made him an expert on the cobbles of northern France which the race crosses. De Vlaeminck used the early season Italian stage race Tirreno–Adriatico as training for the spring classics. He dominated the race between 1972 and 1977, winning every edition and taking 15 stages. His six victories are the most of all time and no other rider has won the race more than twice.

De Vlaeminck is one of only three riders to have won all five &#x27;Monuments of Cycling&#x27; (i.e., Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and the Giro di Lombardia). The other two are fellow Belgians Rik van Looy and Eddy Merckx. In total De Vlaeminck won 11 Monument races, and finished in the top ten on an additional 25 occasions. The only major one-day race he did not win was the world road race championship, his best performance was second to Dutchman Hennie Kuiper in 1975.

He rode three Tours de France, winning stage 6 in 1970 between Amiens and Valenciennes. De Vlaeminck took the points jersey in the Giro d&#x27;Italia on three occasions as well as 22 stages overall including seven stages in 1975. He took a stage win in the Vuelta a España in his final season in 1984. His career lasted 15 years and he eventually had 259 road race victories. He always kept active in cyclo-cross, resulting in 70 cyclo-cross victories and a world title in 1975. De Vlaeminck also had a few successes on track, with several podium finishes in Six-Day races and a national Madison title in 1972 alongside Patrick Sercu. This makes him the only cyclist who won a Belgian national championship in road cycling, cyclo-cross and track cycling.
=== Rivalry with Merckx ===
In 1970, Rik Van Looy ended his career and many fans then focused on Roger De Vlaeminck as his successor. Another young rider who could succeed Van Looy was Eddy Merckx. When the professional careers of both riders had just started, De Vlaeminck always wanted to beat Merckx. He was even disappointed if someone else came in second, because then people could say he had no opposition. After racing against each other for a number of years, the two started to think differently about each other. De Vlaeminck gained respect for Merckx&#x27;s performance and Merckx appreciated that his competitor always fought him with an open mind.

De Vlaeminck also believes that there were others who benefited from the competition between him and Merckx. He often restricted his competitor, but this cost so much strength that someone else took advantage of it. De Vlaeminck also says that he could have won some races if Merckx had not participated, but in other races he drove better because he never wanted to be inferior to his competitor.

Ultimately, De Vlaeminck named his son Eddy De Vlaeminck, after his competitor.

==Post-career==

De Vlaeminck, who lives on a farm in Kaprijke, is still in cycling. He has been coaching cyclo-cross riders. In April 2004 he quit his job as coach to the John Saey-Deschacht team in Belgium to spend more time with his family, However he was tempted back to the sport in November 2004 as advisor to the Zimbabwe team as it prepared for the world championship in St. Wendel, Germany, at the end of January 2005.

De Vlaeminck is known for firm opinions about cycling and is often consulted by journalists. In particular, he criticizes the trend to have multiple leaders in a team. That, he says, means the best racers share important races between them. De Vlaeminck is also known for his harsh opinion of Tom Boonen, calling him unworthy of equaling his Paris–Roubaix record of 4 wins, claiming cycling is not as hard as it used to be. This led to the meme &quot;In den tijd van Roger De Vlaeminck ...&quot; (&quot;in the days of Roger De Vlaeminck&quot;) where De Vlaeminck was attributed to doing all kinds of unrealistic stuff.

<text>An absentee ballot is a vote cast by someone who is unable or unwilling to attend the official polling station to which the voter is normally allocated. Methods include voting at a different location, postal voting, proxy voting and online voting. Increasing the ease of access to absentee ballots is seen by many as one way to improve voter turnout through convenience voting, though some countries require that a valid reason, such as infirmity or travel, be given before a voter can participate in an absentee ballot. Early voting overlaps with absentee voting. Early voting includes votes cast before the official election day(s), by mail, online or in-person at voting centers which are open for the purpose. Some places call early in-person voting a form of &quot;absentee&quot; voting, since voters are absent from the polling place on election day.

In the electoral terminology of some countries, such as Australia, &quot;absentee voting&quot; means specifically a vote cast at a different polling station to one to which the voter has been allocated. &quot;Early voting&quot;, &quot;proxy voting&quot; or &quot;postal voting&quot; are separate concepts in these countries. The history of absentee voting dates back to the 19th century, and modern-day procedures and availability vary by jurisdiction. Absentee voting may be available on demand, or limited to individuals meeting certain criteria, such as a proven inability to travel to a designated polling place. Many electors are required to apply for absentee voting, although some may receive a postal ballot by default. In some elections postal voting is the only voting method allowed and is referred to as all-postal voting. Typically, postal votes must be mailed back on or before the scheduled election day. However, in some jurisdictions return methods may allow for dropping off the ballot in person via secure drop boxes or at voting centers.

Electoral laws typically allow for the integrity and secrecy of the submitted ballot to be maintained, and stipulate a series of checks to protect against voter fraud. Voting at a distant polling place is subject to the same controls as voting locally, though distant staff are less likely to recognize an impersonator than local staff. Voting by mail is sometimes controlled by using security printing, such as special paper, or by requiring signatures of voters and sometimes witnesses, though signature comparisons have 10-14% error rates. Thousands of ballots fail these checks and are rejected. Evidence of fraud is uncommon, but Russia has been reported to use absentee voting for vote monitoring enabling voter intimidation. While postal voting has a greater risk of fraud than in-person voting, on an absolute level cases of known fraud are extremely rare.

==Methods==
===Voting at a different polling station===
Among countries where voters are allocated to one or several specific polling station(s) (such as the polling station closest to the voter&#x27;s residential address, or polling stations within a particular district, province or state), some countries provide a mechanism by which voters can nevertheless cast their ballots on election day at a different polling station.

The reasons for allocating voters to specific polling stations are generally logistical. Absentee voting at a different polling station might be catered for by, for example, designating some larger polling stations as available for absentee voting, and equipping such polling stations with the ballot papers (or the means to produce ballot papers) applicable to an absentee voter.

===Postal voting===
In a postal vote, the ballot papers are posted out to the voter – usually only on request – who must then fill them out and return them, often with the voter&#x27;s signature and sometimes a witness signature to prove the voter&#x27;s identity. Signature verification is an imperfect endeavor; the best academic researchers have 10-14% error rates. Some jurisdictions use special paper, ballot tracking, or printing to minimize forged ballots.

===All-postal voting===
&quot;All-postal&quot; voting is the form of postal voting where all electors receive their ballot papers through the post, not just those who requested an absentee ballot. Depending on the system applied, electors may have to return their ballot papers by post, or there may be an opportunity to deliver them by hand to a specified location.

There is some evidence that this method of voting leads to higher turnout than one where people vote in person or have to apply for a postal vote. Critics suggest that this is only a temporary impact, and that there are dangers in people using ballot papers intended for other electors.

It has been tested by a large number of local authorities in the United Kingdom for their elections, and in 2004 it was used for elections to the European Parliament and local authorities in four of the English regions (see below for more details). In 2016, the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey was conducted via all-postal voting with a turnout of 79.5 percent.

===Proxy voting===
To cast a proxy vote, the user appoints someone as their &quot;proxy&quot;, by authorizing them to cast or secure their vote in their stead. The proxy must be trusted by the voter, as in a secret ballot there is no way of verifying that they voted for the correct candidate. In an attempt to solve this, it is not uncommon for people to nominate an official of their chosen party as their proxy.

===Internet voting===
Security experts have found security problems in every attempt at online voting,

including systems in Australia,
Estonia
Switzerland,
Russia,
and the United States. More information is in the sections for each country below.

Online voting is widely used privately for shareholder votes. The election management companies do not promise accuracy or privacy. In fact one company uses an individual&#x27;s past votes for research, and to target ads.

==By country==
===Australia===
In Australia the term &quot;absentee ballot&quot; refers specifically to the procedure used when a voter attends a voting place which is not in the electoral district in which they are registered to vote. Instead of marking the ballot paper and putting it in the ballot box, the voter&#x27;s ballot paper is placed in an envelope and then it is sent by the voting official to the voter&#x27;s home district to be counted there.

Postal voting and early voting are separate procedures also available to voters who would not be in their registered electoral districts on a voting day.
At the 2016 Australian federal election, there were 1.2 million postal votes cast, amounting to 8.5 percent of total votes.

Postal voting in Australia was introduced for federal elections in 1902, and first used at the 1903 election. It was abolished by the Fisher government in 1910, following claims that it was open to abuse and biased towards rural voters. The Cook government&#x27;s bill to restore postal voting was one of the &quot;triggers&quot; for the double dissolution prior to the 1914 election. Postal voting was eventually restored by the Hughes government in 1918 and has not been challenged since, although the provisions and requirements have been amended on a number of occasions.

Prior to Federation in 1901, Western Australia introduced a form of postal voting in 1877 with strict eligibility criteria. South Australia introduced postal voting for seamen in 1890, and a further act in 1896 gave postal votes to any elector who would be more than from home on election day, as well as for any woman unable to travel &quot;by reason of her health&quot;. Victoria passed a similar law in 1899, and the first federal postal voting legislation was also modelled on the 1896 South Australian act.

====Procedure in Australia====
Postal voting at a federal level is governed by the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot; and administered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Postal votes are available to those who will be absent from their electoral division through travel, or who those are unable to attend a polling booth due to illness, infirmity, &quot;approaching childbirth&quot;, caring responsibilities, reasonable fears for their safety, religious beliefs, imprisonment, status as a silent elector, or employment reasons.

Eligible voters may make a postal vote application (PVA) prior to each election, or apply for status as a &quot;general postal voter&quot; and receive a postal ballot automatically. Postal voters receive their ballot(s) and a prepaid envelope containing their name and address, as well as a predetermined security question from the PVA. Voters are required to sign the envelope and provide the correct answer to the security question. They are also required to have a witness sign and date the envelope. As of 2016, postal votes were able to be received and entered into the count up to 13 days after election day. Following the 2016 election, it was observed that the strict scrutiny process afforded to postal votes was a &quot;significant contributor&quot; to delays in declaring the results of close elections.

===Austria===

Austria enabled postal voting in 2007 by amending Article 26 of the Constitution of Austria. Electors request an electoral card that can be completed in person or in private and sent via post. In the 2017 election, roughly 780,000 postal ballots were cast representing 15% of all ballots.

===Canada===
The ability to vote when in-person voting is not possible was first introduced with the federal &quot;Military Voters Act&quot; in 1917, giving all Canadian soldiers and their spouses the right to vote. Public servants became eligible in 1970. The right was further extended to civilian support personnel on Canadian Forces bases in the 1977. In 1993, Bill C-114 extended the special ballot vote (Special Voting Rules) by mail to all Canadian citizens.

Use of special voting rules including vote by mail has grown with each election. In the 42nd general election (2015), the number of voters increased by 117 percent over the previous election to roughly 619,000. This number grew to roughly 660,000 in the 43rd election (2019) representing 3.6 percent of electors.

===Estonia===

Since 2005, Estonia has allowed voters to cast votes via the Internet (encrypted to protect voter anonymity); 2% of Estonians cast ballots via the Internet initially, and 44% did so in 2019. The Estonian Internet-voting system uses the Estonian national identity card, which is associated with a PINs unique to each voter: &quot;all Estonians are issued a government ID with a scannable chip and a PIN number that gives them a unique online identity — they can use this identity to file their taxes or pay library fines or buy bus passes.&quot;

The security of the Estonian I-voting system remains a matter of debate.

===Finland===

Finland introduced vote by post in 2019, but only for the eligible voters living permanently abroad or staying abroad at the time of the elections. Vote by post is not available for voters residing in Finland.

===France===

France allows voting by &quot;procuration&quot;, which is literally proxy voting. It has been said access to it has been eased in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.

In the 2012 French legislative election, French citizens living abroad were permitted to cast votes electronically in the parliamentary elections (but not in the presidential election). In 2017, however, the system was dropped after the French National Cybersecurity Agency assessed an &quot;extremely high risk&quot; of cyberattacks in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

===Germany===

Absentee voting has existed in Germany since 1957, originally in order to ensure that all German citizens, especially the old, sick, and disabled, and citizens living abroad, have the opportunity to participate in elections. At first, postal voters had to state why they could not cast their vote in person on Election Day; but this requirement has been dropped in 2008, allowing everyone to use postal voting. Like in many other countries, in more recent years, voting by mail has become increasingly popular among younger and non-disabled citizens residing within the country; as such, various tools are being developed to help citizens, both domestic and abroad, more easily apply for postal voting.

===Hungary===
Hungarian citizens living abroad who do not have an official address in Hungary are allowed to vote by mail. They are only allowed to vote for party lists, but not for local representatives. In the last parliamentary election in 2018, 267,233 votes (4.6% of all votes) were submitted via mail. 48% of all valid postal votes were submitted from Romania.

===India===

Only certain categories of people are eligible to register as postal voters. The Representation of the People Act-1950 (RPA) section 20(8) allows postal ballots for people on polling duty; members of the armed forces and state police as well as their spouses; employees of the Government of India who are officially posted abroad; and the President;, these are also called &quot;service voters&quot;. Additionally, people in preventive detention, disabled and those above the age of 65 years old can use postal vote. Prisoners can not vote at all.

Postal voting in India is done only through the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot Papers (ETPB) system of the Election Commission of India, where ballot papers are distributed to the registered eligible voters and they return the votes by post. When the counting of votes commences, these postal votes are counted first before the counting of votes from the electronic voting machines of all other voters.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has alleged that postal ballots &quot;will adversely effect the verifiability of a large number of voters, thus, transparency and integrity of the process&quot;, and expressed concerns with &quot;instances of manipulation and malpractice&quot; with postal ballots.

Section 20 of the RPA-1950 disqualified non-resident Indians (NRI) from getting their names registered in the electoral rolls. Consequently, it also prevented non-residents from voting. In August 2010, Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill-2010 which allows voting rights to NRI&#x27;s was passed in both Lok Sabha with subsequent gazette notifications on Nov 24, 2010. With this NRI&#x27;s could vote in Indian elections if &quot;physically present&quot; at the time of voting. Civic society organizations have urged the government to amend the RPA act to allow NRI&#x27;s and people on the move to cast their vote through absentee ballot system.

===Indonesia===

Eligible Indonesians living abroad are able to vote by mail in national elections by registering at the Indonesian overseas election commission in their country of residence. Besides presidential elections, they are also able to vote in DPR elections. All overseas Indonesian voters are included in the Jakarta 2nd constituency, which also contains Central and South Jakarta.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, postal votes are used in Seanad Éireann elections for the university constituencies and the vocational panels, both of which have restricted franchises. Otherwise, postal voting is only available in a restricted set of circumstances. The Irish constitution requires a secret ballot and the courts have interpreted this quite narrowly. Postal votes are available to people who by reason of their occupation cannot vote normally. They are also available to students living away from home, to people with disabilities, to prisoners (since January 2007), and to long-term residents of hospitals, nursing homes and other similar institutions.

===Israel===
Israel does not have an absentee ballot system for all citizens. Absentee ballots are restricted to soldiers, prisoners, sailors, overseas diplomats, disabled persons and hospitalized people. The votes are not cast directly but placed in a double envelope with identifying information and counted directly by the elections committee only after verifying that the voter has not voted at his or her official polling station. Most absentee ballots are cast the day of the elections in alternate polling stations. Early voting is limited to civil servants overseas. There is no postal voting.

===Italy===

Since 2001 Italian citizens living abroad have the right to vote by mail in all national elections and referendums being held in Italy (provided they had registered their residence abroad with their relevant consulate).

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, opposition leader and former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim alleged that postal votes have been used by the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition in securing seats in certain constituencies. He also said that in one particular constituency (Setiawangsa), he claimed that his Parti Keadilan Rakyat had actually won during the 2008 elections, before 14,000 postal votes came in awarding the incumbent BN parliamentarian the seat with a majority of 8,000 votes. In Malaysia, only teachers, military personnel, and policemen based away from their constituencies are eligible to submit postal votes.

===Mexico===

In Mexico, since the 2006 federal elections, postal voting for people living abroad has been permitted. A request can be made to the National Electoral Institute which then sends the ballots outside the country.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, liberalised proxy voting is available. Voters can authorise someone else to cast their ballot without having to go through a registration procedure. Voters can cast a maximum of 2 proxy votes along with their own ballot. Postal ballots and Internet voting are only available to Dutch citizens living abroad, or having occupational duties abroad on election day.

Electronic voting was banned in the Netherlands in 2007, and in 2017 Dutch authorities also abandoned electronic vote counting, conducting an all-paper, all-manual vote count in an effort to block foreign interference in its elections.

===Philippines===
As provided by the Overseas Absentee Voting Act, absentee voting in Philippine elections is only available in certain circumstances, such as for Overseas Filipino Workers or other migrants. Votes must be cast in person at select polling places, such as a consulate office; mail-in ballots are an option for Filipinos in select countries. Local absentee voting as pursuant to Republic Act No. 7166 and Executive Order No. 157 is only available for members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Philippine National Police, and government personnel on duty on election day. The absentee voting in both overseas and local is still manual vote counting system.

Recently, absentee voting in Hong Kong and Singapore was done through the optical scan voting due to COMELEC Resolution No. 8806 in the 2010 general elections.

Absentee voters can only vote for candidates elected by the entire electorate: the President, Vice President, senators, and party-list representatives.

===Poland===
In Poland, each citizen registered in the local voters&#x27; register, can get an &quot;absentee voter&#x27;s certificate&quot; (AVC), which is a piece of paper with the person&#x27;s details and the local government&#x27;s stamp. The person can vote with AVC at every polling station countrywide and worldwide (in Polish embassies and consulates; the polling stations abroad are created by the Minister of Foreign Affairs before every elections). An AVC is issued only for President of Poland elections, parliamentary elections and elections to the European Parliament (in that case, the AVC can be got by Polish or EU citizen, so the EU citizen can vote for Polish deputies at polling station in Poland and Polish embassies or consulates, or for deputies from the country of origin. Although, if the EU citizen registers himself in the Polish voters&#x27; register, the local officials informs appropriate office in the country of origin). In case of Senate by-elections, AVC may be issued only for voters living and registered in given single-member constituency.

Postal voting and proxy voting are also possible. Postal voting is possible both in country and abroad, but proxy voting is possible only in Poland. The proxy must be registered at the same local voters&#x27; register as a voter. The mail with the voter&#x27;s ballot in postal voting is free of charge in Poland, but voter resides abroad must pay to send his ballot to the appropriate consulate.

===Spain===
In Spain, for European, regional and municipal elections, voters who will be absent from their town on election day or are ill or disabled, may request a postal vote at a post office. The application must be submitted personally or through a representative in case of illness or disability certified by a medical certificate.

===Switzerland===

Swiss federal law allows postal voting in all federal elections and referendums, and all cantons also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail and may either cast it at a polling station or mail it back. As of 2019, approximately 90% of Swiss voters cast ballots using Remote Postal Voting.

In Switzerland, starting in 2004, 15 cantons conducted electronic voting pilot programs. In three cantons, Swiss voters resident abroad voted electronically; Geneva Canton, Canton of Neuchâtel, and Basel-Stadt. The programs were closed in June and July 2019, and the plan is for new designs to be available by 2023.

In 2019 the Swiss government invited researchers to test the security of online voting, and in early March 2019 researchers found back doors which let insiders, and hackers who accessed management systems, change results without detection.

===Thailand===
Absentee balloting started in Thailand first time in the 2000 general election. It is promulgated according to a provision in the 1997 constitution. The absentee ballot can be cast within Thailand and in foreign countries, where Thailand has diplomatic missions. Voters can cast the absentee ballot in 2 cases: (1) those who have their household registration in their constituency but will not be at their constituency on the election day, and wish to cast their vote in advance; and (2) those who physically reside in other locations out of their constituency at least 90 days prior to the election day, and will not be able to travel back to their constituency on the election day.

In both cases, voters wishing to cast their absentee ballot must register with the election committee 30 days in advance prior to the general election date. Voters within Thailand can cast their vote either at the designated district offices for absentee voting in their provinces or through mail. Likewise, voters overseas can register to vote with the Thai missions in their country of residence or send the ballot to them by mail. The absentee voting date is normally designated a week ahead of the general election date.

===United Kingdom===
Absentee voting in the United Kingdom is allowed by proxy or post (known as &quot;postal voting on demand&quot;) for any elector. Postal voting does not require a reason, apart from in Northern Ireland, where postal voting is available only if it would be unreasonable to expect a voter to go to a polling station on polling day as a result of employment, disability or education restrictions.

Proxy voting is allowed for people who will be away, working, or medically disabled. Anyone eligible to vote in the election may be a proxy for close relatives and two unrelated people.

In May 2003, 35 local authorities trialled all-postal voting. The outcome of those pilots was a recommendation from the UK Electoral Commission that all-postal voting should be adopted as the normal method of voting at local elections in the UK. This reflected the positive impact on voter turnout at these elections (in some places, turnout doubled) and the fact that there was no evidence of an increase in electoral fraud.

A 2016 government review said about postal voting, that &quot;Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders... the possibilities of undue influence, theft of postal votes and tampering with them after completion were all still risks.&quot;

===United States===

Voters may vote early or get a mailed ballot to mail back or take to a secure box or office. Most areas do not require a reason.
Five states and some counties have all-postal elections. Vote-by-mail has been implemented in both Republican and Democratic states, but it became a political controversy in 2020. Availability of postal voting increases turnout.

Americans living outside the United States and members of the military and merchant marine even inside the country, and their families, may register and vote under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). Almost half the states require these ballots to be returned by mail. Other states allow mail along with some combination of fax, or email; four states allow a web portal.

Security of mailed ballots is controlled by using special paper in some areas, and, more often, by requiring signatures of voters and sometimes witnesses. Signature comparisons are imperfect; the best academic researchers have 10-14% error rates. Thousands of ballots fail the signature checks and are rejected. Evidence of fraud is uncommon, though postal voting has a greater risk of fraud than in-person voting. Not all states have standards for signature review.
There have been concerns that signatures are improperly rejected from young and minority voters at higher rates than others, with no or limited ability of voters to appeal the rejection.

Processing large numbers of ballots and signature verifications accurately has numerous challenges other than fraud.

In the 2016 US presidential election, approximately 33 million ballots were cast via mailed out ballots (about a quarter of all ballots cast).

The number of people who voted early or with mail-in ballots set records in the 2020 election. This is because of the coronavirus pandemic and people choosing the option of absentee ballots.

===Uruguay===
In Uruguay there is no mail in voting, online voting, or proxy voting. Every citizen is required by law to register as voter at 18 years old, and is assigned a voter ID that contains a photo (&quot;Credencial Cívica&quot;). Each citizen is assigned a specific voting circuit that is close to his/her registered address. You cannot vote anywhere else, except you are an election worker assigned to a different circuit than yours. To vote you need to go in person to the circuit and show election workers your physical voter ID. Else you need to remember the ID number. On both cases your data is compared with a copy of that ID in the circuit. If you do not even remember your ID, you can vote by fingerprint plus showing a national ID card. Every absentee ballot is manually controlled after election day to avoid the same voter casting more than one vote. The system is regarded as extremely difficult to tamper with, and accepted by all involved parties as safe and anonymous.

==Russia==
Absentee ballots have been reportedly used for vote monitoring in Russia.

<doc id="1127540" wikidata="Q5104880" url="?curid=1127540" title="Chopsocky">
<text>Chopsocky (or chop-socky) is a colloquial term for martial arts films and kung fu films made primarily by Hong Kong action cinema between the late 1960s and early 1980s. The term was coined by the American motion picture trade magazine &quot;Variety&quot; following the explosion of films in the genre released in 1973 in the U.S. after the success of &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot;. The word is a play on chop suey, combining &quot;chop&quot; (as in karate chop referring to a strike with the edge of the hand) and &quot;sock&quot; (as in a punch).

Chopsocky movies are usually characterized by overblown storylines, over-the-top special effects (particularly exaggerated and sometimes bizarre sound effects during the actual fight scenes), and excessive violence. The genre is also known for its clumsy dubbing. Although the term &quot;chopsocky&quot; is commonly used as a name of martial arts cinema by the general media, the word can be disparaging as well. Another common meaning is a generalization for martial arts movies from Asia or Hong Kong in particular, without necessarily having the negative connotation. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, the originator of the term, defined &quot;chopsocky&quot; simply as a martial arts film with no negative connotations.

==Kung fu craze (1970s–1980s)==
Hong Kong action cinema&#x27;s international impact initially came in the form of martial arts films, especially 1970s kung fu films and most notably those of Bruce Lee. His earliest attempts at introducing his brand of Hong Kong martial arts cinema to the West came in the form of American television shows, such as &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (1966 debut) and &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (1972 debut). The &quot;kung fu craze&quot; began in early 1973, with the unprecedented overseas box office success of Hong Kong martial arts films. It spread across Asia and then Europe, with Bruce Lee becoming established as the biggest box office movie star of the genre, before the craze reached North America by early 1973. The films were initially called &quot;martial science&quot; or &quot;Chinese boxer&quot; pictures, while the martial artist protagonists were referred to as &quot;chow mein spies&quot; or &quot;superhero Chinese&quot; agents, drawing comparisons to the earlier Spaghetti Western craze.

&quot;King Boxer&quot; (&quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot;) starring Indonesian-born actor Lo Lieh was the first Hong Kong film to top the US box office, paving the way for Bruce Lee&#x27;s breakthrough with &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (&quot;Fists of Fury&quot;) topping the US box office. In May 1973, Hong Kong action cinema made US box office history, with three foreign films holding the top three spots for the first time: &quot;Fists of Fury&quot;, &quot;Lady Whirlwind&quot; (&quot;Deep Thrust&quot;), and &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot;. Lee continued his success with &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (&quot;The Chinese Connection&quot;), which also topped the US box office the following month.

Kung fu film releases in the United States initially targeted Asian American audiences, before becoming a breakout success among larger African-American and Hispanic audiences, and then among white working-class Americans. Kung fu films also became a global success, across Asia, Europe and the third world. This eventually paved the way for Lee&#x27;s posthumous Hollywood film breakthrough with the Hong Kong and US co-production &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973). Hong Kong martial arts cinema subsequently inspired a wave of Western martial arts films and television shows throughout the 1970s–1990s (launching the careers of Western martial arts stars such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris), as well as the more general integration of Asian martial arts into Western action films and television shows by the 1990s, such as the Yuen Woo-Ping choreographed &quot;Matrix trilogy&quot;.

Sascha Matuszak of &quot;Vice&quot; said &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; &quot;is referenced in all manner of media, the plot line and characters continue to influence storytellers today, and the impact was particularly felt in the revolutionizing way the film portrayed African-Americans, Asians and traditional martial arts.&quot; Kuan-Hsing Chen and Beng Huat Chua cited fight scenes in Hong Kong films such as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; as being influential for the way they pitched &quot;an elemental story of good against evil in such a spectacle-saturated way&quot;.

In Japan, the manga and anime franchises &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; (1983–1988) and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; (1984–1995) were influenced by Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly 1970s kung fu films such as Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; and Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (1978). In turn, &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; and especially &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; are credited with setting the trends for popular shōnen manga and anime from the 1980s onwards.

Similarly in India, Hong Kong martial arts films had an influence on Hindi masala films. After the success of Bruce Lee films (such as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;) in India, &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975) and later Hindi films incorporated fight scenes inspired by 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films up until the 1990s. Hindi cinema action scenes emulated Hong Kong rather than Hollywood, emphasising acrobatics and stunts and combining kung fu (as perceived by Indians) with Indian martial arts such as pehlwani.

Hong Kong martial arts films such as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; were the foundation for fighting games. The &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game franchise (1987 debut) was inspired by &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, with the gameplay centered around an international fighting tournament, and each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality and fighting style. &quot;Street Fighter&quot; went on to set the template for all fighting games that followed. The early beat &#x27;em up game &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984) was also based on Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1972) and Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1984).

The success of Bruce Lee&#x27;s films helped popularize the concept of mixed martial arts (MMA) in the West via his Jeet Kune Do system. In 2004, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) founder Dana White called Lee the &quot;father of mixed martial arts&quot;. Parkour was also influenced by the acrobatic antics of Jackie Chan in his Hong Kong action films, as well as the philosophy of Bruce Lee.

<doc id="1127541" wikidata="Q2914681" url="?curid=1127541" title="Originality">
<text>Originality is the aspect of created or invented works that distinguish them from reproductions, clones, forgeries, or substantially derivative works. The modern idea of originality is according to some scholars tied to Romanticism, by a notion that is often called romantic originality. The validity of &quot;originality&quot; as an operational concept has been questioned. For example, there is no clear boundary between &quot;derivative&quot; and &quot;inspired by&quot; or &quot;in the tradition of.&quot; 

The concept of originality is both culturally and historically contingent. For example, unattributed reiteration of a published text in one culture might be considered plagiarism but in another culture might be regarded as a convention of veneration. At the time of Shakespeare, it was more common to appreciate the similarity with an admired classical work, and Shakespeare himself avoided &quot;unnecessary invention&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until the start of the 18th century that the concept of originality became an ideal in Western culture.

==Originality in law==
In law, originality has become an important legal concept with respect to intellectual property, where creativity and invention have manifest as protectable or copyrightable works.
In the &quot;Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works&quot; (1886) that has been adapted by 181 countries and city-states, &quot;original work&quot; gives a creator exclusive rights; protection for creative works are automatically in force upon their creation without being asserted or declared.

In the patent law of the United States, only original inventions can be subject to protection. In addition to being original, inventions submitted for a patent must also be useful and nonobvious.

In United States copyright law copyrights protect only &quot;original&quot; works of authorship, a property which has been historically and legally linked to a concept of &quot;creativity&quot;. A work must pass a threshold of originality in order to be copyrightable. In other countries protection of a work often is connected to similar conditions. 

In United Kingdom intellectual property law, a derived work can demonstrate originality, and must do so if it is to respect copyright.

== Originality under United States copyright law ==
In the copyright law of the United States, more specifically under 17 U.S.C 102, the work that is sought to be protected must satisfy the threshold for originality. Though most of the countries require certain degree of originality in the work sought to be protected, such requirement does not stem from either the Berne Convention or the TRIPS Agreement. Therefore, there is no uniformity in the standard for originality. In the United States, originality necessitates bare minimum degree of creativity and independent creation. The Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co. held that the work must be independently created and must possess minimum degree of creativity. This interpretation requires an extremely low level of creativity and in the words of the court, &quot;must possess some creative spark no matter how crude, humble or obvious it might be.&quot; The court also took the opportunity to reject the previously judicially-established and followed the &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; doctrine. According to the said doctrine, labour and hard-work alone could suffice to establish originality. After the doctrine was rejected by the Supreme Court in 1991, in the Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp &quot;case&quot;, the court held that the copies of public domain photographs could not be copyrighted since they lacked originality and while such reproductions may have involved skill and labour, no protection could be granted to them, on account of lack of originality.

While the current legal requirements of originality viz. minimum level of creativity and independent labour can be easily assessed and applied in case of literary works, the courts are required to undertake a deeper legal and factual inquiry in photographic works. The United States District Court for Southern District of New York in Mannion v. Coors Brewing Company considered originality in terms of timing, subject and rendition, and held that the nature and extent of the copyright would be independent in the three aspects. The requirement for originality was incorporated in the statute only in the Copyright Act, 1976 and over the course of time, the courts have evolved various metrics to apply the test. Unlike, Patents, novelty is not required for a work to be considered as original. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Sheldon (1936) had clarified that sometimes it is relevant for other purposes. Therefore, if the work created by you is identical to a pre-existing work but you are unaware of the latter&#x27;s existence, you may still enjoy copyright protection for your work.

Apart from novelty, the work is not required to be made with an intent to be original. What is considered is only that it is actually an independent creation in effect. In 1951, the court in Alfred Bell Co. v. Catalda Arts held that the question as to whether there was intent to be original was not to be considered. The Supreme Court of the United States has also clarified that it is not necessary for the work to be artistic to qualify as original. Furthermore, in the landmark ruling, the court observed that it would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme, some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke. It may be more than doubted, for instance, whether the etchings of Goya or the paintings of Monet would have been sure of protection when seen for the first time. At the other end, copyright would be denied to pictures which appealed to a public less educated than the judge. This observation was an embodiment of the principle of artistic or aesthetic neutrality which seeks to eliminate the inherent subjectivity involved in the judges deciding whether the work is artistic, and hence, the question as to whether it warrants protection. The principle finds four broad justifications- (i) lack of expertise in the judges (ii) fear of elitism (iii) fear of paternalism (also called parentalism) (iv) lack of consensus on what constitutes art. However, scholars note that the principle of aesthetic neutrality is often violated as the adjudicators end up favouring creators of what they believe is deserving of copyright grant.

In the United States, the work is not required to be non-commercial in nature for copyright protection and unlike the US trademark law, the work need to be necessarily lawful. Therefore, works created for commercial purposes, such as advertisements can also be granted a copyright.

== Originality under Indian copyright law ==
Section 13(1)(a) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 mentions &#x27;originality&#x27; as a requirement for copyright protection to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Courts have interpreted this requirement of &#x27;originality&#x27; in different ways. This has given rise to various doctrines/tests that can be helpful in determining whether a work meets the threshold of originality. The most prominent case with respect to &#x27;originality&#x27; under the Indian Copyright Law is the &quot;Eastern Book Company v DCB Modak&quot;. This judgment gave rise to two doctrines i.e. &quot;modicum of creativity&quot; and the &quot;skill and judgment test&quot;. This remains the accepted and current position of law in India as of now. However, prior to this, the Indian Courts used to follow the Sweat of the Brow approach.

=== &quot;Sweat of the brow&quot; doctrine ===

This theory bases the grant of copyright protection on the effort and labour that an author puts into their work as opposed to the creativity involved. Locke&#x27;s theory of labour as property has often been extended to give jurisprudential basis to this theory of copyright law. In the case of &quot;V. Govindan v E.M. Gopalakrishna Kone,&quot; it was held that compilations of information would meet the threshold of &#x27;originality&#x27; under the Indian Copyright Act since it involves some level of &#x27;skill, labour and brain&#x27;. A similar line of reasoning was adopted in the case of &quot;Burlington Home Shipping Pvt Ltd v Rajnish Chibber&quot; where a database was held to be original enough to be protected by copyright under Indian law. However, like in other jurisdictions, this theory was discarded by the Indian Courts also and the focus was shifted to the creativity involved in any work.

=== EBC Modak case (modicum of creativity and skill and judgment test) ===
The EBC Modak case is the Indian counterpart of the Feist Publications case in terms of the test it laid down. It concerned the copyrightability of Supreme Court judgments that were copy-edited and published by Eastern Book Company. These judgments were published along with &#x27;headnotes&#x27; that were written by the Company itself. While explicitly discarding the Sweat of the Brow theory, the Court held that simply copy editing would not meet the threshold of originality under copyright law since it would only demonstrate an &quot;amount of skill, labour and capital put in the inputs of the copy-edited judgments and the original or innovative thoughts for the creativity would be completely excluded.&quot;. Thus, it introduced the requirement of &#x27;creativity&#x27; under originality. With respect to the level of creativity involved, the court adopted the &#x27;minimal degree of creativity&#x27; approach. Following this standard, the headnotes that did not copy from the judgment verbatim were held to be copyrightable.

Finally, the Court also gave way to the &#x27;Skill and Judgment Test&#x27; which is more or less a compromise between the sweat of the brow theory and the modicum of creativity test. While relying on the CCH Canadian Case, the Court essentially held that a work would meet the originality standard as long as there is labour or effort involved but not &quot;only&quot; labour. It must involve some level of skill and judgment as well. However, this approach mirrors the Sweat of the Brow theory more closely and is therefore a difficult theory to defend. Further, the Court held the division of a judgment into paragraphs and numbering them was enough to meet this standard of &#x27;Skill and Judgment&#x27;. Whether this is the correct interpretation of the test as given in the CCH Canadian Case remains debatable.

== Originality in science ==
Scientific literature considered as primary must contain original research, and even review articles contain original analysis or interpretation.

==Originality of ideas and creative works==
An original idea is one not thought up by another person beforehand. Sometimes, two or more people can come up with the same idea independently. Originality is usually associated with characteristics such as being imaginative and creative.

The evaluation of originality depends not only on the creative work itself, but also on the temporal context, the zeitgeist. In a study of the musical originality of 15,618 classical music themes, the importance of objective characteristics and the zeitgeist for popularity was examined. Both the musical originality of a theme relative to its contemporary works (the zeitgeist), as well as its &quot;absolute&quot; originality influenced in similar magnitude the popularity of a theme. Similarly, objective features and temporal context both influenced the evaluation of linguistic originality.

==Original recording==
An original painting, photographic negative, analog audio, or video recording, will contain qualities that can be difficult, or under current technology may be impossible to copy in its full integrity. That can also apply for any other artifact.

That is why it is often necessary to preserve the original, in order to preserve its original integrity. The copy is made to preserve the original recording by saving the original from degenerating as it is being played, rather than to replace the original.

<doc id="1127545" wikidata="Q6430995" url="?curid=1127545" title="Multi-valve">
<text>A multi-valve or multivalve engine is one where each cylinder has more than two valves (an intake, and an exhaust). A multi-valve engine has better breathing, and with more smaller valves (having less mass in motion) may be able to operate at higher revolutions per minute (RPM) than a two-valve engine, delivering more power.

== Multi-valve rationale ==

=== Multi-valve engine design ===

A multi-valve engine design has three, four, or five valves per cylinder to achieve improved performance. In automotive engineering, any four-stroke internal combustion engine needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for &quot;intake&quot; of air (and often fuel), and another for &quot;exhaust&quot; of combustion gases. Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing combustion, volumetric efficiency, and power output. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower reciprocating mass, which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher RPM without the danger of valve float. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of multi-valve engines are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve stem seals. Some single overhead camshaft (SOHC) multi-valve engines (such as the Mazda B8-ME) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be needed in order to reduce manufacturing costs.
* Three-valve cylinder head
This has a single large exhaust valve and two smaller intake valves. A three-valve layout allows better breathing than a two-valve head, but the large exhaust valve results in an RPM limit no higher than a two-valve head. The manufacturing cost for this design can be lower than for a four-valve design. The three-valve design was common in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and from 2004 the main valve arrangement used in Ford F-Series trucks, and Ford SUVs. The Ducati ST3 V-twin had 3-valve heads.
* Four-valve cylinder head
This is the most common type of multi-valve head, with two exhaust valves and two similar (or slightly larger) inlet valves. This design allows similar breathing as compared to a three-valve head, and as the small exhaust valves allow high RPM, this design is very suitable for high power outputs.
* Five-valve cylinder head
Less common is the five-valve head, with two exhaust valves and three inlet valves. All five valves are similar in size. This design allows excellent breathing, and, as every valve is small, high RPM and very high power outputs are theoretically available. Although, compared to a four-valve engine, a five-valve design should have a higher maximum RPM, and the three inlet ports should give efficient cylinder-filling and high gas turbulence (both desirable traits), it has been questioned whether a five-valve configuration gives a cost-effective benefit over four-valve designs. The rise of direct injection may also make five-valve heads more difficult to engineer, as the injector must take up some space on the head. After making five-valve Genesis engines for several years, Yamaha has since reverted to the cheaper four-valve design.

Examples of the five-valve engines are the various 1.8 L 20vT engines manufactured by AUDI AG, the later versions of the Ferrari Dino V8, and the 1.6 L 20-valve 4A-GE engine made by Toyota in collaboration with Yamaha.
* Beyond five valves
For a cylindrical bore and equal-area sized valves, increasing the number of valves beyond five &quot;decreases&quot; the total valve area. The following table shows the effective areas of differing valve quantities as proportion of cylinder bore. These percentages are based on simple geometry and do not take into account orifices for spark plugs or injectors, but these voids will usually be sited in the &quot;dead space&quot; unavailable for valves. Also, in practice, intake valves are often larger than exhaust valves in heads with an even number of valves-per-cylinder:
* 2 = 50%
* 3 = 64%
* 4 = 68%
* 5 = 68%
* 6 = 66%
* 7 = 64%
* 8 = 61%

=== Alternative technologies ===
Turbocharging and supercharging are technologies that also improve engine breathing, and can be used instead of, or in conjunction with, multi-valve engines. The same applies to variable valve timing and variable-length intake manifolds. Rotary valves also offer improved engine breathing and high rev performance but these were never very successful. Cylinder head porting, as part of engine tuning, is also used to improve engine performance.

== Cars and trucks ==

=== Before 1914 ===
The 1908 Ariès VT race cars had 1.4 litre supercharged single cylinder engines with four valve per cylinder desmodromic systems. (Source: [1])

The 1910 Isotta-Fraschini Tipo KM had a 10.6 litre inline 4 with single overhead camshaft and four valves per cylinder and it had one of the first engines with fully enclosed overhead valve gear (source: Isotta Fraschini Tipo KM and )

The first motorcar in the world to have an engine with two overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder was the 1912 Peugeot L76 Grand Prix race car designed by Ernest Henry. Its 7.6-litre monobloc straight-4 with modern hemispherical combustion chambers produced (19.5 HP/Liter(0.32 bhp per cubic inch)). In April 1913, on the Brooklands racetrack in England, a specially built L76 called &quot;la Torpille&quot; (torpedo) beat the world speed record of 170 km/h. Robert Peugeot also commissioned the young Ettore Bugatti to develop a GP racing car for the 1912 Grand Prix. This chain-driven Bugatti Type 18 had a 5-litre straight-4 with SOHC and three valves per cylinder (two inlet, one exhaust). It produced appr. at 2800 rpm (0.30 bhp per cubic inch) and could reach . The three-valve head would later be used for some of Bugatti&#x27;s most famous cars, including the 1922 Type 29 Grand Prix racer and the legendary Type 35 of 1924. Both Type 29 and Type 35 had a 2-liter SOHC 24-valve NA straight-8 that produced per cubic inch.

=== Between 1914 and 1945 ===

A.L.F.A. 40/60 GP was a fully working early racing car prototype made by the company now called Alfa Romeo. Only one example was built in 1914, which was later modified in 1921. This design of Giuseppe Merosi was the first Alfa Romeo DOHC engine. It had four valves per cylinder, 90-degree valve angle and twin-spark ignition. The GP engine had a displacement of 4.5-liter (4490 cc) and produced at 2950 rpm (14.7 kW/liter), and after modifications in 1921 at 3000 rpm. The top speed of this car was 88-93 mph (140–149 km/h). It wasn&#x27;t until the 1920s when these DOHC engines came to Alfa road cars like the Alfa Romeo 6C.

In 1916 US automotive magazine &quot;Automobile Topics&quot; described a four-cylinder, four-valve-per-cylinder car engine made by Linthwaite-Hussey Motor Co. of Los Angeles, CA, USA: &quot;Firm offers two models of high-speed motor with twin intakes and exhausts.&quot;.

Early multi-valve engines in T-head configuration were the 1917 &quot;Stutz&quot; straight-4, White Motor Car Model GL 327 CID Dual Valve Mononblock four, and 1919 &quot;Pierce-Arrow&quot; straight-6 engines. The standard flathead engines of that day were not very efficient and designers tried to improve engine performance by using multiple valves. The Stutz Motor Company used a modified T-head with 16 valves, twin-spark ignition and aluminium pistons to produce 80 bhp (59 kW) at 2400 rpm from a 360.8 cid (5.8-liter) straight-4 (0.22 bhp per cubic inch). Over 2300 of these powerful early multi-valve engines were built. Stutz not only used them in their famous Bearcat sportscar but in their standard touring cars as well. The mono block White Motor Car engine developed 72 horsepower and less than 150 were built, only three are known to exist today. In 1919 Pierce-Arrow introduced its 524.8 cid (8.6-liter) straight-6 with 24 valves. The engine produced 48.6 bhp (0.09 bhp per cubic inch) and ran very quietly, which was an asset to the bootleggers of that era.

Multi-valve engines continued to be popular in racing and sports engines. Robert M. Roof, the chief engineer for Laurel Motors, designed his multi-valve &quot;Roof Racing Overheads&quot; early in the 20th century. Type A 16-valve heads were successful in the teens, Type B was offered in 1918 and Type C 16-valve in 1923. Frank Lockhart drove a Type C overhead cam car to victory in Indiana in 1926.

Bugatti also had developed a 1.5-liter OHV straight-4 with four valves per cylinder as far back as 1914 but did not use this engine until after World War I. It produced appr. 30 bhp (22.4 kW) at 2700 rpm (15.4 kW/liter or 0.34 bhp/cid). In the 1920 Voiturettes Grand Prix at Le Mans driver Ernest Friderich finished first in a Bugatti Type 13 with the 16-valve engine, averaging 91.96 km/h. Even more successful was Bugattis clean sweep of the first four places at Brescia in 1921. In honour of this memorable victory all 16-valve-engined Bugattis were dubbed &quot;Brescia&quot;. From 1920 through 1926 about 2000 were built.

Peugeot had a triple overhead cam 5-valve Grand Prix car in 1921.

Bentley used multi-valve engines from the beginning. The Bentley 3 Litre, introduced in 1921, used a monobloc straight-4 with aluminium pistons, pent-roof combustion chambers, twin spark ignition, SOHC, and four valves per cylinder. It produced appr. 70 bhp (0.38 bhp per cubic inch). The 1927 Bentley 4½ Litre was of similar engine design. The NA racing model offered 130 bhp (0.48 bhp per cubic inch) and the 1929 supercharged 4½ Litre (Blower Bentley) reached 240 bhp (0.89 bhp per cubic inch). The 1926 Bentley 6½ Litre added two cylinders to the monobloc straight-4. This multi-valve straight-6 offered 180-200 bhp (0.45-0.50 bhp per cubic inch). The 1930 Bentley 8 Litre multi-valve straight-6 produced appr. 220 bhp (0.45 bhp per cubic inch).

In 1931 the Stutz Motor Company introduced a 322 cid (5.3-liter) dual camshaft 32-valve straight-8 with 156 bhp (116 kW) at 3900 rpm, called DV-32. The engine offered 0.48 bhp per cubic inch. About 100 of these multi-valve engines were built. Stutz also used them in their top-of-the-line sportscar, the DV-32 Super Bearcat that could reach 100 mph (160 km/h).

The 1935 Duesenberg SJ Mormon Meteor&#x27;s engine was a 419.6 cid (6.9-liter) straight-8 with DOHC, 4 valves per cylinder and a supercharger. It achieved 400 bhp (298.3 kW) at 5,000 rpm and 0.95 bhp per cubic inch.

The 1937 Mercedes-Benz W125 racing car used a supercharged 5.7-liter straight-8 with DOHC and four valves per cylinder. The engine produced 592-646 bhp (441.5-475 kW) at 5800 rpm and achieved 1.71-1.87 bhp per cubic inch (77.8-85.1 kW/liter). The W125 top speed was appr. 200 mph (322 km/h).

=== After 1945 ===
The 1967 Cosworth DFV F1 engine, a NA 3.0-liter V8 producing appr. at 9,000 rpm (101.9 kW/liter), featured four valves per cylinder. For many years it was the dominant engine in Formula One, and it was also used in other categories, including CART, Formula 3000 and Sportscar racing.

Debuting at the 1968 Japanese Grand Prix in the original 3.0-liter version the Toyota 7 engine participated in endurance races as a 5.0-liter (4,968 cc) non-turbo V8 with DOHC and 32-valves. It produced at 8,000 rpm (88.8 kW/liter) and at 6,400 rpm.

There is much discussion about which was the first &#x27;mass-produced&#x27; car to use an engine with four valves per cylinder. For six cylinder engines, and considering special versions of mass-produced cars, the first appears to have been the 1969 Nissan Skyline, using the Nissan S20 six cylinder DOHC four-valve engine. This engine was also fitted to Nissan Fairlady Z432 racing edition.

For a four-cylinder engine, the first mass-produced car using a four valves per cylinder engine was the British Ford Escort RS1600, this car used the Cosworth BDA engine which was a Ford &#x27;Kent&#x27; block with a Cosworth 16 valve twin cam cylinder head. The car went on to become a rallying legend in the 1970s winning many domestic and World Championship events. Other cars claiming to be first are the Jensen Healey, launched in 1972 which used a Lotus 907 belt-driven DOHC 16-valve 2-liter straight-4 producing 140 bhp (54.6 kW/liter, 1.20 bhp/cid). All of these, although mass-produced, are also of relatively limited production, so it is argued that the first widely available and popularly priced mass-production car with a four valve per cylinder engine was the 1973 Triumph Dolomite Sprint. This Triumph used an in-house developed SOHC 16-valve 1,998 cc (122 ci) straight-4 engine that produced 127 bhp (47.6 kW/liter, 1.10 bhp/cid) at introduction.

The 1975 Chevrolet Cosworth Vega featured a DOHC multi-valve head designed by Cosworth Engineering in the UK. This 122-cubic-inch straight-4 produced at 5600 rpm (0.90 bhp/cid; 41.0 kW/liter) and at 4800 rpm.

The 1976 Fiat 131 Abarth (51.6 kW/liter), 1976 Lotus Esprit with Lotus 907 engine (54.6 kW/liter, 1.20 bhp/cid), and 1978 BMW M1 with BMW M88 engine (58.7 kW/liter, 1.29 bhp/cid) all used four valves per cylinder. The BMW M88/3 engine was used in the 1983 BMW M635CSi and in the 1985 BMW M5.

The 1978 Porsche 935/78 racer used a twin turbo 3.2-liter flat-6 (845 bhp/630 kW@8,200 rpm; 784 Nm/578 ft.lbs@6,600 rpm). The water-cooled engine featured four valves per cylinder and output a massive 196.2 kW/liter. Porsche had to abandon its traditional aircooling because the multi-valve DOHC hampered aircooling of the spark plugs. Only two cars were built.

Ferrari developed their &quot;Quattrovalvole&quot; (or QV) engines in the 80s. Four valves per cylinder were added for the 1982 308 and Mondial &quot;Quattrovalvole&quot;, bringing power back up to the pre-FI high of . A very unusual Dino Quattrovalvole was used in the 1986 Lancia Thema 8.32. It was based on the 308 QV&#x27;s engine, but used a split-plane crankshaft rather than the Ferrari-type flat-plane. The engine was constructed by Ducati rather than Ferrari, and was produced from 1986 through 1991. The Quattrovalvole was also used by Lancia for their attempt at the World Sportscar Championship with the LC2. The engine was twin-turbocharged and destroked to 2.65 litres, but produced in qualifying trim. The engine was later increased to 3.0 litres and increased power output to . The 1984 Ferrari Testarossa had a 4.9-liter flat-12 with four valves per cylinder. Almost 7,200 Testarossa were produced between 1984 and 1991.

In 1985 Lamborghini released a Countach &quot;Quattrovalvole&quot;, producing from a 5.2-liter (5167 cc) Lamborghini V12 engine (64.8 kW/liter).

The Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.3-16 with 16-valve engine debuted at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 1983 after it set a world record at Nardo, Italy, recording a combined average speed of over the endurance test. The engine was based on the 2.3-liter 8-valve 136 hp (101 kW) unit already fitted to the 190- and E-Class series. Cosworth developed the DOHC light alloy cast cylinder head with four large valves per cylinder. In roadgoing trim, the 190 E 2.3-16 produced 49 hp (36 kW) and 41 ft•lbf (55 N•m) of torque more than the basic single overhead cam 2.3 straight-4 engine on which it was based offering at 6,200 rpm (59.2 kW/liter) and at 4,500 rpm. In 1988 an enlarged 2.5-liter engine replaced the 2.3-liter. It offered double valve timing chains to fix the easily snapping single chains on early 2.3 engines, and increased peak output by 17 bhp (12.5 kW) with a slight increase in torque. For homologation Evolution I (1989) and Evolution II (1990) models were produced that had a redesigned engine to allow for a higher rev limit and improved top-end power capabilities. The Evo II engine offered from 2463 cc (70.2 kW/liter).

Saab introduced a 16-valve head to their 2.0-liter (1985 cc) straight-4 in 1984 and offered the engine with and without turbocharger (65.5 kW/liter and 47.9 kW/liter respectively) in the Saab 900 and Saab 9000.

The 2.0-liter Nissan FJ20 was one of the earliest straight-4 mass-produced Japanese engines to have both a DOHC 16-valve configuration (four valves per cylinder, two intake, two exhaust) and electronic fuel injection (EFI) when released in October 1981 in the sixth generation Nissan Skyline. Peak output was at 6,000 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. The FJ20 was also offered with a turbocharger, producing at 6,400 rpm and at 4,800 rpm.

Following Nissan&#x27;s lead, Toyota released the 1.6-liter (1,587 cc) 4A-GE engine in 1983. The cylinder head was developed by Yamaha Motor Corporation and was built at Toyota&#x27;s Shimayama plant. While originally conceived of as a two-valve design, Toyota and Yamaha changed the 4A-GE to a four-valve after a year of evaluation. It produced 115-140 bhp (86-104 kW) at 6,600 rpm (54.2-65.5 kW/liter) and at 5,800 rpm. To compensate for the reduced air speed of a multi-valve engine at low rpms, the first-to-second generation engines included the T-VIS intake system.

In 1986 Volkswagen introduced a multi-valved Golf GTI 16V. The 16-valve 1.8-liter straight-4 produced 139 PS (102 kW; 137 bhp) or 56.7 kW/liter, almost 25% up from the 45.6 kW/liter for the previous 8-valve Golf GTI engine.

The GM Quad 4 multi-valve engine family debuted early 1987. The Quad 4 was the first mainstream multi-valve engine to be produced by GM after the Chevrolet Cosworth Vega. The NA Quad 4 achieved per cubic inch (49.1 kW/liter). Such engines soon became common as Japanese manufacturers adopted the multi-valve concept.

==== Three valves ====
The 1975 Honda Civic introduced Honda&#x27;s 1.5-liter SOHC 12-valve straight-4 engines. Nissan&#x27;s 1988–1992 SOHC KA24E engine had three valves per cylinder (two intakes, one exhaust) as well. Nissan upgraded to DOHC after 1992 for some of their sports cars, including the 240SX.

In 1988, Renault released a 12 valve version of its Douvrin 4 cylinder 2.0l SOHC.

Mercedes and Ford produced three-valve V6 and V8 engines, Ford claiming an 80% improvement in high RPM breathing without the added cost of a DOHC valve train. The Ford design uses one spark plug per cylinder located in the centre, but the Mercedes design uses two spark plugs per cylinder located on opposite sides, leaving the centre free to add a direct-to-cylinder fuel injector at a later date.

The 1989 Citroën XM was the first 3-valve diesel-engined car.

==== Four valves ====

Examples of SOHC four-valve engines include the Honda F-series engines, D-series engines, all J-series engines, the R-series engines, the Mazda B8-ME, and the Chrysler 3.5 L V6 engine.

The V12 engines of many World War II fighter aircraft also used a SOHC configuration with four valves for each cylinder.

The 1993 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (OM604 engine) was the first 4-valve diesel-engined car.

==== Five valves ====

Peugeot had a triple overhead cam five-valve Grand Prix car in 1921.

In April 1988 an Audi 200 Turbo Quattro powered by an experimental 2.2-liter turbocharged 25-valve straight-5 rated at 478 kW/650 PS@6,200 rpm (217.3 kW/liter) set two world speed records at Nardo, Italy: 326.403 km/h (202.8 mph) for 1,000 km (625 miles) and 324.509 km/h (201.6 mph) for 500 miles.

Mitsubishi were the first to market a car engine with five valves per cylinder, with the 548 cc &quot;3G81&quot; engine in their Minica Dangan ZZ kei car in 1989.

Yamaha designed the five-valve cylinder head for the 20-valve 4A-GE engines made by Toyota for use in some Toyota Corolla models in Japan and South Africa, in 1991. Yamaha also developed five-valve Formula One engines, the 1989 OX88 V8, 1991 OX99 V12, 1993 OX10 V10 and 1996 OX11 V10, but none of these were very successful.
For their YZ250F and YZ450F motocross bikes, Yamaha developed five-valve engines.

Bugatti (EB 110), Ferrari (F355, 360 and F50), Volkswagen - Audi (Audi Quattro) - Skoda (Octavia vRS) and Toyota (4A-GE 20V) have all produced five-valve-engined vehicles.

==== Six valves ====

In 1985, Maserati made an experimental 2.0-liter turbo V6 engine with six valves per cylinder (three intakes, three exhaust). It achieved at 7,200 rpm (97.5 kW/liter).

==== Pushrod ====

Although most multi-valve engines have overhead camshafts, either SOHC or DOHC, a multivalve engine may be a pushrod overhead valve engine (OHV) design. GM has revealed a three-valve version of its Generation IV V8 which uses pushrods to actuate forked rockers, and all Duramax V8 engines have four valves per cylinder with pushrods. Moreover, Cummins makes a four-valve OHV straight six diesel, the Cummins B Series (now known as ISB). Ford also uses pushrods in its 6.7L Power Stroke 
engine using four pushrods, four rockers and four valves per cylinder. The 6.0 and 6.4 Powerstroke engine built by Navistar also used pushrods with four-valve heads. Pushrod multi-valve systems are common on diesels because they need to be able to meet emissions standards, but also produce more low-end torque. The Harley-Davidson &quot;Milwaukee Eight&quot; engine, introduced in 2016, uses four-valves per cylinder driven by pushrods and a single in-block camshaft.

==== Turbocharged ====

The 1980 Lotus Essex Turbo Esprit (with type 910 2.2-liter inline four engine) was the first production car to use a multi-valve turbocharged engine.

== Motorcycles ==

Examples of motorcycles with multivalve-engines include:
* 1914 Peugeot Grand Prix racer, 500 cc DOHC 8-valve parallel twin (top speed over 122 km/h).
* 1915 Indian board track racer, 61-cid (1.0-liter) OHV 8-valve V-twin.
* 1921 Triumph Ricardo 499 cc OHV 4-valve single-cylinder machine, copied by Rudge-Whitworth with their 1924 Rudge Four 350 cc OHV 4-valve single-cylinder machine, and 1929 Rudge Ulster 500 cc OHV 4-valve single-cylinder machine.
* 1923 British Anzani 1098cc OHV 8-Valve V-twin, used in Morgan three-wheelers and McEvoy motorcycles

* 1979 -1992: Honda NR series, racing &amp; production motorcycles with 8-valve-per-cylinder &quot;oval-piston&quot; V4 engines (actually 32-valve V8s with adjoining cylinders merged).
* 1985 Yamaha FZ750 motorcycle with DOHC 20-valve straight-4 Yamaha &quot;Genesis&quot; engine.
* 1991-2010 Yamaha TDM and TRX parallel twin motorcycles with 5 valves per cylinder
* 1998–2006 Yamaha YZF-R1 superbike with redesigned (more compact) &quot;Genesis&quot; engine. 2006 model delivered at 12,500 rpm (130.3 kW/liter).

The Yamaha XT660 single once had five valves per cylinder, but a subsequent redesign reduced the valve-count to four. The Aprilia Pegaso 650 single also started out with five valves, but current models only have four. The jointly developed BMW F650 single always had four valves.

== Aircraft ==

Ettore Bugatti designed several multi-valve aircraft engines. The 1916 Bugatti U-16 1484.3 cid (24.32 L) SOHC 16-cylinder, consisting of two parallel 8-cylinder banks, offered 410 bhp (305 kW) at 2,000 rpm (12.5 kW/liter or 0.28 bhp/cid). Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by rocking levers from the camshaft. Other advanced World War I aircraft engines, such as the 1916 Maybach Mb.IVa that produced at altitude and the 1916 Benz Bz.IV with aluminium pistons and the 1918 Napier Lion (a 450 bhp 24-liter DOHC 12-cylinder), used two intake valves and two exhaust valves.

Long after the King-Bugatti &quot;U-16&quot; aviation engine used them, shortly before World War II, the Junkers aviation firm began production of the Third Reich&#x27;s most-produced military aviation engine (68,000+ produced), the 1936-designed, 35-litre displacement, inverted-V12, liquid-cooled Junkers Jumo 211, which used a three-valve cylinder head design inherited from Junkers&#x27; first inverted V12 design, the 1932-origin Junkers Jumo 210 — this was carried through into the later, more powerful 1940-origin Junkers Jumo 213, produced through 1945, the production versions of which (the Jumo 213A and -E subtypes) retained the Jumo 211&#x27;s three-valve cylinder head design.

The V12 engines of many World War II fighter aircraft used a SOHC configuration with four valves for each cylinder.

An example of a modern multi-valve piston-engine for small aircraft is the Austro Engine AE300. This liquid-cooled turbocharged 2.0-liter (1,991 cc) DOHC 16-valve straight-4 diesel engine uses common rail direct fuel injection and delivers at 3,880 rpm (62.0 kW/liter). The propeller is driven by an integrated gearbox (ratio 1.69:1) with torsional vibration damper. Total power unit weight is .

== Boats ==
In 1905 car builder Delahaye had experimented with a DOHC marine racing engine with 6 valves per cylinder. This Delahaye &quot;Titan&quot; engine was a massive four-cylinder that produced 300 bhp (0.07 bhp/cid). It allowed the motor boat &quot;Le Dubonnet&quot; piloted by Emile Dubonnet to set a new world&#x27;s speed record on water, reaching on the lake at Juvisy, near Paris, France.

An example of modern multi-valve engines for small boats is the Volvo Penta IPS Series. These joystick-operated seawater-cooled inboard diesel engines use combined charging (turbo and supercharger, except IPS450) with aftercooler, common rail fuel injection and DOHCs with hydraulic 4-valve technology. Propshaft power ranges from (highest efficiency 59.7 kW/liter for IPS400 3.7-liter straight-4 diesel). Multiple units can be combined.

<doc id="1127548" wikidata="Q1153809" url="?curid=1127548" title="Passive-aggressive behavior">
<text>Passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a pattern of passive hostility and an avoidance of direct communication. Inaction where some action is socially customary is a typical passive-aggressive strategy (showing up late for functions, staying silent when a response is expected). It is typically used to avoid confrontation, rejection, or criticism. Passive-aggressive behavior is sometimes protested by associates, evoking exasperation or confusion. People who are recipients of passive-aggressive behavior may experience anxiety due to the discordance between what they perceive and what the perpetrator is saying.

==Application==
===Psychology===

In psychology, &quot;passive-aggression&quot; is one of the most misused psychological terms. After some debate, the American Psychiatric Association dropped it from the list of personality disorders in the DSM IV as too narrow to be a full-blown diagnosis and not well enough supported by scientific evidence to meet increasingly rigorous standards of definition. Culturally, the ambiguous &quot;passive-aggressive&quot; label is misused by laymen and professionals alike. The removal of the passive-aggressive personality definition from the official diagnostic manual was in large measure because of the frequent misapplication and because of the often contradictory and unclear descriptions clinicians in the field provided. Most of the definitions which follow (which had previously been classified as passive-aggressive) are often more correctly described as overt aggression or covert aggression.

The outdated definition rejected by the American Psychiatric Association is as follows: Passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a habitual pattern of non-active resistance to expected work requirements, opposition, sullenness, stubbornness, and negative attitudes in response to requirements for normal performance levels expected by others. Most frequently it occurs in the workplace, where resistance is exhibited by indirect behaviors such as procrastination, forgetfulness, and purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by authority figures, but it can also occur in interpersonal contexts.

Another source characterizes passive-aggressive behavior as: A personality trait marked by a pervasive pattern of negative attitudes and characterized by passive, sometimes obstructionist resistance to complying with expectations in interpersonal or occupational situations. This includes behaviors such as condescension, belittling, snubbing, subtly insulting insinuations, contrarianism, procrastination, stubbornness, sabotage, the silent treatment, victim playing, sarcasm, resentment, sullenness, or deliberate/repeated failure to accomplish requested tasks for which one is often explicitly responsible.

===Conflict theory===
In conflict theory, passive-aggressive behavior can resemble a behavior better described as , as it consists of deliberate, active, but carefully veiled hostile acts which are distinctively different in character from the non-assertive style of passive resistance.

=== Work ===

Passive-aggressive behavior from workers and managers is damaging to team unity and productivity. If this behavior is ignored, it could result in decreased office efficiency and frustration among workers. If managers are passive-aggressive in their behavior, it can end up stifling team creativity. Paula De Angelis says, &quot;It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes.&quot;

== History ==
Passive-aggressive behavior was first defined clinically by Colonel William C. Menninger during World War II in the context of men&#x27;s reaction to military compliance. Menninger described soldiers who were not openly defiant but expressed their civil disobedience (what he called &quot;aggressiveness&quot;) by &quot;passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism&quot; due to what Menninger saw as an &quot;immaturity&quot; and a reaction to &quot;routine military stress&quot;.

According to some psychoanalytic views, noncompliance is not indicative of true passive-aggressive behavior, which may instead be defined as the manifestation of emotions that have been repressed based on a self-imposed need for acceptance.

<text>Jackie Todd Brambles (born 1 March 1967) is a British journalist, radio DJ and television presenter. In the earlier part of her broadcasting career she was known as Jakki Brambles.

==Early life and early career==
Brambles was born in Harlow, Essex, England and grew up in Ayrshire, Scotland, where she went to secondary school at Ayr Academy in Fort Street, Ayr. She also began her radio career on local radio station West Sound in Ayr when she was 19.

==Career==
She joined Capital London in 1987 as its youngest DJ, and after a year on the evening show joined the BBC in 1988 and had her own prime time show on the national pop network BBC Radio 1. She took on the Radio 1&#x27;s early morning show, first at weekends, before moving to weekdays. She also joined her colleagues on the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; presentation roster. When Sybil Ruscoe left her role as Simon Mayo&#x27;s weather and travel reporter on the breakfast show, Brambles took over that slot, thereby keeping her on air every day over two separate programmes. 

In 1993 she married a Scotsman named Jim Sherry and left BBC Radio 1 in 1994 to move to the United States, where she lived for 11 years. The marriage ended in 1998. There was a plan to make her an American showbiz reporter for the BBC but this never transpired. Instead, she re-branded herself as the more maturely-spelt Jackie Brambles, and entered American broadcasting in San Francisco as a news radio morning anchor and occasional television news anchor for the CBS network. She also worked as a media consultant to several high-profile companies in Silicon Valley, including Intel, Oracle and Sony. Following a move to Los Angeles in 1999, she took on the role of foreign correspondent for GMTV, interviewing almost every major star in Hollywood as well as covering major news events including two presidential elections and the events of 9/11. 

Six months after returning to the UK in 2005, Brambles married David Todd, who works in financial services, and had her first child. After leaving GMTV, she made several guest appearances on &quot;Loose Women&quot; in 2005. During Kaye Adams&#x27;s maternity leave in 2006, Brambles hosted the show in Adams&#x27; place, which led to her becoming the new leading host of the show. On 7 August 2009, she closed her final show, after presenting 316 episodes between 2005 and 2009.

Brambles owns her own digital media business called Broadstance Digital Media Production.

In June 2009 to 2010, Brambles was a commentator on the political show &quot;This Week&quot;, where her topic was girl power. Brambles was a presenter of various shows on BBC Radio Scotland. From 2010 until 2012, she guest presented 16 episodes of the ITV Breakfast programme &quot;Lorraine&quot;.

Since 2015 she has hosted the STV series &quot;Stopping Scotland&#x27;s Scammers&quot;.

In December 2021, she was hired by Bauer Radio to replace Darren Proctor on Greatest Hits Radio. On 16 December 2021, Brambles was interviewed by Simon Mayo on &quot;Simon Mayo Drivetime.&quot; as Jackie herself returns to radio broadcasting after 27 years away. Her show, which started on 4 January 2022, follows Mayo&#x27;s in the schedules from 19:00 to 22:00 every Monday–Thursday.

==Personal life==
Brambles married David Todd (born 23 March 1975) on 4 August 2005. The couple have two children, a son Stanley (born 2006) and a daughter Florence (born 2007), as a result of which Brambles left GMTV to concentrate on motherhood. In December 2008, &quot;Nuts&quot; magazine held their annual &#x27;Woman I Secretly Adore&#x27; poll, in which Brambles came second with 18% of the vote. She was beaten by GMTV presenter Kate Garraway, who received 21%.

<text>The Roumois () is a region in the northwestern part of the Eure &quot;département&quot; in Normandy, France. It is a plateau situated southwest of Rouen. Its northern boundary is the Seine downstream of Elbeuf, its western boundary is the Risle valley. The plain of Le Neubourg lies to the south. The main towns of the Roumois are Bourg-Achard and Bourgtheroulde-Infreville. The landscape is similar to that of the Pays de Caux on the north side of the Seine.

The economy is mainly based on agriculture, but it is also influenced by the nearby Rouen agglomeration.

<text>Album-oriented rock (AOR, originally called album-oriented radio) is an FM radio format created in the United States in the late 1960s that focuses on the full repertoire of rock albums and is currently associated with classic rock.

US radio stations dedicated to playing album tracks by rock artists from the hard rock and progressive rock genres initially established album-oriented radio. In the mid-1970s, AOR was characterized by a layered, mellifluous sound and sophisticated production with considerable dependence on melodic hooks. The AOR format achieved tremendous popularity in the late 1960s to the early 1980s through research and formal programming to create an album rock format with great commercial appeal.

From the early 1980s onward, the abbreviation AOR transitioned from &quot;album-oriented radio&quot; to &quot;album-oriented rock&quot;, meaning radio stations specialized in classic rock recorded during the late 1960s and 1970s.

The term is also commonly conflated with &quot;adult-oriented rock&quot;, a radio format that also uses the initialism &quot;AOR&quot; and covers not only album-oriented rock but also album tracks and &quot;&quot; from a range of other rock genres, such as soft rock and pop rock.

==History==

===Freeform and progressive===
The album-oriented rock radio format started with programming concepts in the 1960s. The freeform and progressive formats developed the tone for AOR playlists for much of its heyday.

In July 1964, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a non-duplication rule prohibiting FM radio stations from running a simulcast of the programming from their AM counterparts. AM/FM affiliate station owners fought these new regulations, delaying enactment until January 1, 1967.

The freeform format in commercial radio was created to program the FM airwaves inexpensively. Programmers like Tom Donahue at KMPX in San Francisco developed stations where DJs had the freedom to play long sets of music, often covering a variety of genres. Not limited to hits or singles, DJs often played obscure or longer tracks by newer or more adventurous artists rather than those heard on Top 40 stations of the day. This new format caused albums, instead of singles, to be rock&#x27;s main artistic vehicle in the 1960s and 1970s.

With a few exceptions, commercial freeform had a relatively brief life. With more listeners acquiring FM radios, it became more important for stations to attract larger market share to sell more advertising. By 1970, many of the stations were instituting programming rules with a &quot;clock&quot; and system of &quot;rotation.&quot; With this shift, stations&#x27; formats in the early 1970s were now billed as progressive. However, DJs still had input over the music they played. The selection was deep and eclectic, with a range of genres. 

===1970s===
In October 1971, WPLJ in New York began to shift its freeform progressive rock format into a tighter, hit-oriented rock format similar to what would later become known as AOR. WPLJ&#x27;s parent company, ABC, installed similar formats on all of its FM stations, including KLOS in Los Angeles and WRIF in Detroit. Gordon McLendon followed suit on his stations, most infamously at WPHD in Buffalo, New York, where McLendon cut over 90% of the station&#x27;s album library and pushed popular evening jock Jim Santella—whom McLendon did not like—to publicly resign. In 1973, Lee Abrams, formerly at WRIF, successfully installed a similar format, later known as SuperStars, at WQDR in Raleigh, North Carolina.

In 1972, Ron Jacobs, program director at KGB-FM in San Diego, began using detailed listener research and expanded playlists in shifting the Top 40 station toward a progressive rock format. Meanwhile, at competing station KPRI, program director Mike Harrison was similarly applying Top 40 concepts to the progressive format, which he dubbed &quot;album-oriented rock.&quot;

In the mid-1970s, as program directors began to exert more control over what songs played on air, progressive stations evolved into the album-oriented rock format. Stations still played longer songs and deep album tracks (rather than just singles). However, program directors and consultants took on a more significant role in song selection, generally limiting airplay to just a few &quot;focus tracks&quot; from a particular album and concentrating on artists with a more &quot;commercial&quot; sound than those featured a few years earlier. Noted DJ &quot;Kid Leo&quot; Travagliante of the station WMMS in Cleveland observed the changes in a 1975 interview: &quot;I think the &#x27;60s are ending about now. Now we are really starting the &#x27;70s. The emphasis is shifting back to entertainment instead of being &#x27;relevant.&#x27; In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t call our station progressive radio. That&#x27;s outdated. I call it radio. But I heard a good word in the trades, AOR. That&#x27;s Album-Oriented Rock. That&#x27;s a name for the &#x27;70s.&quot;

Radio consultants Kent Burkhart and Lee Abrams significantly affected AOR programming. The two consultants created Kent Burkhart/Lee Abrams &amp; Associates, which became one of the most prominent AOR consulting firms during the mid to late 1970s. Abrams&#x27; SuperStars format, previously developed at WQDR, was based on extensive research, focused on the most popular artists, such as Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles, and included older material from those artists. While his format was not quite as constricted as Top 40 radio, it was considerably more restricted than freeform or progressive radio. Their firm advised program directors for a substantial segment of AOR stations all over the U.S.

By the late 1970s, AOR radio stations began to focus on a more narrowly defined rock sound. Stations began reducing the number of folk, jazz, and blues artists played and effectively eliminated most black artists from airplay. While AOR had once championed soul, funk, and R&amp;B artists like Stevie Wonder, War, and Sly Stone, the format no longer represented these styles and took a stance against disco. In 1979, Steve Dahl of WLUP in Chicago destroyed disco records on his radio show, culminating in the notorious Disco Demolition Night at Comiskey Park.

The continuity of rock artists and songs carried through each phase links the freeform, progressive, and AOR formats. Programmers and DJs of the freeform and progressive phases continued to cultivate a repertoire of rock music and style of delivery that became the foundations of AOR and classic rock radio. Those AOR stations, which decided to stay demographically rooted, became classic rock stations by eschewing newer bands and styles for which their older listeners might have tuned out.

==Programming==
Most radio formats are based on a select, tight rotation of hit singles. The best example is Top 40, though other formats, like country, smooth jazz, and urban, all utilize the same basic principles, with the most popular songs repeating every two to six hours, depending on their rank in the rotation. Generally, there is a strict order or list to follow, and the DJ does not decide playlist selections.

While still based on the rotation concept, AOR focused on the album as a whole rather than singles. In the early 1970s, many DJs were free to choose which track(s) to play off a given album and the latitude to decide the playlist order. Consequently, AOR radio gave mainstream exposure to album tracks that never became hits on the record charts limited to singles; &quot;Billboard&quot;, for instance, did not establish an airplay chart for album tracks until 1981.

Later in the 1970s, AOR stations shifted song selection to a program director or music director rather than the DJ. Still, when an AOR station added an album to rotation, they often focused on numerous tracks simultaneously rather than playing the singles as they were individually released.

==Criticism==
In the early 1980s, Black Music Association, a trade association, and other industry observers criticized AOR radio for lacking black artists in their programming. AOR programmers responded that the lack of diversity was the result of increased specialization of radio formats driven by ratings and audience demographics. In 1983, the success of Michael Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Thriller&quot; led to the album&#x27;s track &quot;Beat It,&quot; which featured Eddie Van Halen, being added to the playlists of many AOR stations. At the same time, other black artists also made inroads into AOR radio: Prince (&quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;), and Eddy Grant (&quot;Electric Avenue&quot;) debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Tracks chart during the same week in April 1983. Through the remainder of the 1980s, Jon Butcher, Tracy Chapman, Living Colour, and Lenny Kravitz also received AOR airplay.

<text>The Welsh Language Board () was a statutory body set up by HM Government under the Welsh Language Act 1993. It was an Assembly Sponsored Public Body. It began its life under John Walter Jones, and its last chief executive was Meirion Prys Jones, with Meri Huws acting as chair.

It received an annual government grant of £13m which was used to &quot;promote and facilitate&quot; the use of the Welsh language.

The board was responsible for administering the Welsh Language Act and for seeing that public bodies in Wales kept to its terms. Over 500 Welsh language schemes were agreed with a range of bodies named under the provisions of the act.

In cases where there were concerns that public bodies were not complying with their Welsh language schemes, the board could hold a statutory investigation. If the board&#x27;s investigations indicated that an organisation has broken its own Welsh language scheme, it could produce recommendations to the organisation and, ultimately, refer the matter to the minister for heritage at the Welsh Assembly Government.

The board&#x27;s private sector and business team worked with a wide variety of large and small companies. Since launching the private sector Welsh language policy in November 2008, over 100 businesses produced a policy, and 150 companies signed up to the Board&#x27;s &quot;Investing in Welsh scheme&quot;, indicating support for the language.

The Welsh Language Board was at the forefront of promoting bilingual design, in part by making annual bilingual awards. In 2006, winners included FBA, Glass Hammer, Synergy Creative Design &amp; Marketing, Hoffi, 6721, Elfen, Zodshop and Departures.

In winter 2004 Rhodri Morgan, previous First Minister of Wales, announced his decision to abolish the Welsh Language Board. This decision evoked a mixed reaction throughout Wales: welcomed by &quot;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&quot; but met with scepticism by others. It was abolished on 31 March 2012 and replaced by the Welsh Language Commissioner: Meri Huws was the first commissioner. The board&#x27;s powers were transferred to the Welsh Government and the commissioner.

<doc id="1127564" wikidata="Q5247445" url="?curid=1127564" title="Shooting of Harry Stanley">
<text>Henry Bruce Stanley (2 May 195322 September 1999) was a Scottish painter and decorator who was shot dead by the Metropolitan Police in London in contentious circumstances. Initially his death was recorded with an open verdict, before being ruled as unlawful killing by a jury on appeal and finally returned to an open verdict by the High Court.

==Background==
Stanley was born in Bellshill, near Glasgow, Scotland, where he lived for the first 19 years of his life. He moved to London in the early 1970s in search of work, and married his childhood sweetheart, Irene. They had three children, and grandchildren, and lived in Hackney, east London. He had a previous criminal record, being convicted of armed robbery in 1974, and had served 4 years in prison for grievous bodily harm. This was unknown to the police officers who responded to the call about &quot;an Irishman with a gun wrapped in a bag&quot;. The 46-year-old painter and decorator had recently been released from hospital after an operation for colon cancer at the time of his death.

==Shooting==
On 22 September 1999, Stanley was returning home from the Alexandra Pub in South Hackney carrying, in a plastic bag, a table leg that had been repaired by his brother earlier that day. Someone had phoned the police to report &quot;an Irishman with a gun wrapped in a bag&quot;.

At the junction of Fremont Street and Victoria Park Road in South Hackney, close to his home, Inspector Neil Sharman and PC Kevin Fagan, the crew of a Metropolitan Police Armed Response Vehicle challenged Stanley from behind. As he turned to face them, they shot him dead at a distance of 15 feet (5 m).

==Hearings==
===First inquest===
The first inquest jury in 2002 returned an open verdict. Stanley&#x27;s family were unhappy with this outcome, particularly as the coroner, Dr. Stephen Chan, had only allowed the jury to return either a verdict of lawful killing or an open verdict.

===Judicial review===
Stanley&#x27;s widow, Irene, petitioned the High Court and succeeded in obtaining a judicial review of the first inquest. On 7 April 2003 Mr. Justice Sieber ordered a fresh inquest after ruling that there had been an &quot;insufficient inquiry&quot;.

During the new hearing, coroner Dr. Andrew Reid heard that the two officers fired the shots after being given wrong information in a tipoff; they had been told that Stanley was carrying a weapon and had an Irish accent. The new jury returned a verdict, in November 2004, of unlawful killing, which resulted in the suspension of the officers involved.

In protest at the suspensions, over 120 out of the 400 Metropolitan Police officers authorised to use firearms handed in their firearms authorisation cards, with Glen Smyth, a Police Federation spokesman saying, &quot;The officers are very concerned that the tactics they are trained in, as a consequence of the verdict, are now in doubt.&quot; The officers&#x27; suspensions were lifted shortly afterwards.

===High Court===
In May 2005 the High Court decided that there was &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; for the verdict of unlawful killing, overturning it and reinstating the open verdict of the first inquest. Mr. Justice Leveson also decided a third inquest should not be held, but added his weight to calls for reform of the inquest system. Glen Smyth described the ruling as &quot;common sense&quot;, but the campaign group Inquest was disappointed, saying the verdict sent &quot;a message that families cannot have any confidence in the system. They feel they cannot get justice when a death in custody occurs.&quot;

==Police action==
On 2 June 2005 the two officers involved in the shooting were arrested and interviewed, following an investigation by Surrey Police involving new forensic evidence. The Crown Prosecution Service decided in October 2005 not to press charges, saying that they &quot;concluded that the prosecution evidence is insufficient to rebut the officers&#x27; assertion that they were acting in self defence&quot;.

On 9 February 2006 the Independent Police Complaints Commission published their report into the incident, recommending that no further disciplinary action be taken against the officers. Representatives of the Stanley family expressed their &quot;bitter disappointment&quot; and stated the case was a failure of the criminal justice system. The Metropolitan Police Federation stated, &quot;We are, of course, delighted by the vindication of the officers. But we remain deeply disturbed at the way the whole matter has been handled.&quot; The report did make notable recommendations to the police in the post-incident procedure to be followed after a shooting.

<doc id="1127569" wikidata="Q7913683" url="?curid=1127569" title="Van Sweringen brothers">
<text>Oris Paxton Van Sweringen (April 24, 1879 – November 22, 1936) and Mantis James Van Sweringen (July 8, 1881 – December 12, 1935) were American brothers who became railroad barons in order to develop Shaker Heights, Ohio. They are better known as O. P. Van Sweringen and M. J. Van Sweringen, or by their collective nickname, the Vans. The brothers came from a farming area near Wooster, Ohio. Their father was for a time an engineer in the oil fields of Pennsylvania, fought in the Civil War and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. The family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in about 1890.

Neither brother married. The two shared a common bedroom in their 54-room mansion, Roundwood Manor, on the grounds of their estate, Daisy Hill, in Hunting Valley, Ohio. During their lifetimes, they seldom gave interviews or made appearances in public. When they did, it was always together.

==Career==
===Real estate and Shaker Heights===
Before the establishment of Shaker Heights, Ohio, the brothers were land and building speculators in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1909, the Van Sweringen brothers began exercising options on 1,399 acres (5.7 km2) of land formerly owned by the North Union Community of the Society of Believers, better known as the Shakers. Conceived and planned as a garden community similar to Baltimore&#x27;s Roland Park, Shaker Village soon became Cleveland&#x27;s most sought-after address. This was achieved through a combination of planning, design review, and convenience – all of which fell under the strict supervision of the Van Sweringens.

Street planning for the new community used curved roads, instead of the more usual grid pattern of streets found in many American communities. Three tree-lined boulevards extended eastward into the country. Moreland and Shaker boulevards&#x27; center isles were used for trackbed for a planned interurban streetcar line. Both lines shared a common route from Cleveland through Shaker Square, recognized as the second modern planned shopping center in the United States, where they divided onto their own routes. The Van Sweringens designated Shaker Boulevard as a grand boulevard of mansions, fronted by generous setbacks from the interurban tracks. Higher-density luxury apartments were planned for Moreland Boulevard, which was renamed Van Aken Boulevard in honor of the city&#x27;s first mayor.

Building in Shaker was controlled by a set of restrictive covenants and building guidelines established by the Van Sweringens and known as Shaker Standards. Shaker Standards prevented the community from being developed in any way contrary to how the Van Sweringens intended, including barring African Americans. Standards limited commercial development, rental property development, and residence style and size. Standards set roof slope angles, materials, finishes, and garage placement.

All residences were required to be unique and designed by an architect. Duplex residences in the community were restricted to designated areas and were required to follow guidelines designed to give the impression that a structure was a single-family home. By 1920, the Van Sweringens controlled more than 4,000 acres (16 km2) in the community, which reached city status in 1931. Since lots sold slowly, the brothers concluded that Shaker Heights needed a transportation system between the suburb and downtown.

===Railroad projects===

In 1913, the Van Sweringens established the Cleveland Interurban Railroad, which managed the operation of their streetcar lines in what is now Cleveland Heights, Ohio. In order to provide convenience to residents of Shaker Heights, the Van Sweringens planned a high-speed interurban styled electric rail line, which was christened Shaker Heights Rapid Transit and commonly known as the Rapid. This prompted the Van Sweringens to purchase land in the vicinity of Public Square in downtown Cleveland as early as 1909 to provide a terminus for their rapid transit line. Their Rapids could travel at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 km/h), but the line could not be moved farther west than 34th Street.

In order to meet the Van Sweringens&#x27; guidelines that the Rapid would not travel in street traffic, the brothers bought a 51% interest in the 523-mile (842-km) New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road) in 1915 from the New York Central Railroad. The route gave the Van Sweringens an unobstructed path to downtown Cleveland. From this acquisition, the Van Sweringens formed the Nickel Plate Securities Corporation, from which they used investor money to buy a controlling interest in other major United States rail companies.

At their zenith in 1928, the Van Sweringens controlled 30,000 miles (50,000 km) of rail worth $3 billion, nearly all of it purchased through credit. Lines under their control included the Erie Railroad, Pere Marquette Railway, Hocking Valley Railway, and Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. They managed to control this huge (for the time) system by a maze of holding companies (including the Alleghany Corporation) and interlocking directorships.

To solve the problem of the passenger station, the Van Sweringens purchased more rights-of-way that gave them access to the area below the southwest corner of Cleveland&#x27;s Public Square. Again, the Van Sweringens planned another city within a city to solve their rail dilemma. The result was the Union Terminal Complex, a mix of high-rise offices, shopping, and hotel aboveground, with a train depot and rapid station below grade. The centerpiece of this massive complex was named Terminal Tower, which was the second tallest skyscraper in the United States at the time of its completion.

===The Terminal Tower===

The Van Sweringens realized that if their plans for a Public Square station were to succeed, they would have to include all the electric railways, including streetcars, rapid transit, interurban lines, and local freight and warehousing facilities. Following the suggestion of an official of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, they added plans to include steam railways.

On March 1, 1917, the engineers of the Erie Railroad, the Nickel Plate, and the Cleveland Terminal Company reported that a new freight-and-passenger terminal located on Public Square in downtown Cleveland would be economical. The plan provided twelve stub-end tracks for the steam passenger trains, with loops for local and interurban cars above. The space above the tracks was to be developed for stores and office buildings.

In 1918, A.H. Smith, the Eastern Director of the United States Railroad Administration and the president of the New York Central Railroad, asked whether or not the proposed facility could be sufficiently enlarged to include the railroads using the lakefront station. Thus, it was Smith who initiated the idea for a &quot;Union Station&quot; on Public Square. In 1919, the Pennsylvania Railroad withdrew from the project. Smith, in his capacity as the president of the NYCRR, allied with the Van Sweringens, was fiercely opposed Pennsylvania Railroad.

In 1923, the Van Sweringens announced their plans to build The Terminal Tower, a tall building to increase office space, over the Union Station to compare to the Woolworth Building in New York City. It was necessary to design the buildings to avoid vibrations from the trains below. In 1926, construction began. 16 caissons each went down 200 to 250 feet (60 to 75 m) to support the weight of the building. Construction was completed in 1930.

In 1973, Amtrak chose to move out of the station, instead serving a small station along the lake route, ending intercity service to the station, though Cleveland Rapid Transit continued its local services. In 1975, the Rapid and other municipal rail and bus routes were combined under the auspices of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. The station area was converted into a shopping mall known as Tower City Center, which opened in 1990.

==Decline and death==
The fortunes of the Van Sweringens rose in the 1920s. By 1929, their holdings were valued at $3 billion, mostly as a result of the high valuation of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Following the Great Depression, the brothers&#x27; rail empire suffered financial difficulties. Loans were foreclosed upon and assets were sold to meet interest payments for their debts.

In 1933, O.P. Van Sweringen testified before the United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, in Washington, D.C., and during testimony, described their complex business dealings as it related to railroads.

In 1934, M.J. Van Sweringen&#x27;s health began to decline. He died on December 12, 1935.

O.P. died on board a train near Hoboken of coronary thrombosis on November 22, 1936. At the time of his death, O.P.&#x27;s net worth was less than $3,000.

The brothers are buried together in Cleveland&#x27;s Lakeview Cemetery under a tombstone that reads: &quot;Brothers&quot;.

<text>Bokerley Dyke, Bokerly Dyke, Bokerley Ditch, is a linear earthwork long in Hampshire, between Woodyates and Martin. It is a Scheduled Monument. 

Bokerley Dyke was excavated by Augustus Pitt Rivers between 1888 and 1891 and by Philip Rahtz in advance of road widening in 1958. Bokerley Dyke may have originated in the Bronze Age or Early Iron Age and formed a political and cultural boundary. It was cut through by a Roman Road (Ackling Dyke running between Old Sarum and Badbury Rings) in the 1st century.

In the 4th century it was remodelled and brought back into use, and excavations show that the Roman road was blocked. A coin of Valens dates this activity to shortly after 364 AD. It may have been built in 367-8 AD when Roman sources report that Britain was attacked by Picts, Scots and Saxons in a supposed Great Conspiracy. The Roman road was later reopened, but the dyke may have continued in use after the cessation of the Roman rule and still forms part of a boundary between the counties of Dorset and Hampshire.

Bokerley Dyke runs through Martin and Tidpit Downs, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and it is continuous with Grim&#x27;s Ditch.
