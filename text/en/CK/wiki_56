<text>Jonathan Henry Sacks, Baron Sacks (8 March 19487 November 2020) was an English Orthodox rabbi, philosopher, theologian, and author. Sacks served as the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth from 1991 to 2013. As the spiritual head of the United Synagogue, the largest synagogue body in the United Kingdom, he was the Chief Rabbi of those Orthodox synagogues but was not recognized as the religious authority for the Haredi Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations or for the progressive movements such as Conservative, Reform, and Liberal Judaism. As Chief Rabbi, he formally carried the title of Av Beit Din (head) of the London Beth Din. At the time of his death, he was the Emeritus Chief Rabbi.

After stepping down as Chief Rabbi, in addition to his international travelling and speaking engagements and prolific writing, Sacks served as the Ingeborg and Ira Rennert Global Distinguished Professor of Judaic Thought at New York University and as the Kressel and Ephrat Family University Professor of Jewish Thought at Yeshiva University. He was also appointed Professor of Law, Ethics, and the Bible at King&#x27;s College London. He won the Templeton Prize (awarded for work affirming life&#x27;s spiritual dimension) in 2016. He was also a Senior Fellow to the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.

==Early life==
Jonathan Henry Sacks was born in the Lambeth district of London on 8 March 1948, the son of Jewish (of Ashkenazi Diaspora) textile seller Louis David Sacks (died 1996) and his Jewish wife Louisa (née Frumkin; 1919–2010), who came from a family of leading Jewish wine merchants. He had three brothers named Brian, Alan, and Eliot, all of whom eventually made aliyah. He said that his father did not have &quot;much Jewish education&quot;.

Sacks commenced his formal education at St Mary&#x27;s Primary School and at Christ&#x27;s College, Finchley. He completed his higher education at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he gained a first-class honours degree (MA) in Philosophy. 

While a student at Cambridge, he travelled to New York City, where he met with rabbis Joseph Soloveitchik and Menachem Mendel Schneerson to discuss a variety of issues relating to religion, faith, and philosophy. He later wrote, &quot;Rabbi Soloveitchik had challenged me to think, Rabbi Schneerson had challenged me to lead.&quot; Schneerson urged Sacks to seek rabbinic ordination and enter the rabbinate. 

Sacks subsequently continued his postgraduate studies at New College, Oxford, and King&#x27;s College London, completing a PhD which the University of London awarded him in 1982. 
He received his rabbinic ordination from the London School of Jewish Studies and London&#x27;s Etz Chaim Yeshiva,
with &quot;semikhah&quot; respectively from Rabbis Nahum Rabinovitch and Noson Ordman.

==Career==
Sacks&#x27;s first rabbinic appointment (1978–1982) was as the Rabbi for the Golders Green synagogue in London. In 1983, he became Rabbi of the Western Marble Arch Synagogue in Central London, a position he held until 1990. Between 1984 and 1990, Sacks also served as Principal of Jews&#x27; College, the United Synagogue&#x27;s rabbinical seminary. Dr. Sacks was inducted to serve as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth on 1 September 1991, a position he held until 1 September 2013.

Sacks became a Knight Bachelor in the 2005 Birthday Honours &quot;for services to the Community and to Inter-faith Relations&quot;. He was made an Honorary Freeman of the London Borough of Barnet in September 2006. On 13 July 2009 the House of Lords Appointments Commission announced that Sacks was recommended for a life peerage with a seat in the House of Lords. He took the title &quot;Baron Sacks of Aldgate in the City of London&quot; and sat as a crossbencher.

A visiting professor at several universities in Britain, the United States, and Israel, Sacks held 16 honorary degrees, including a doctorate of divinity conferred on him in September 2001 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, to mark his first ten years in office as Chief Rabbi. In recognition of his work, Sacks won several international awards, including the Jerusalem Prize in 1995 for his contribution to diaspora Jewish life and The Ladislaus Laszt Ecumenical and Social Concern Award from Ben Gurion University in Israel in 2011.

The author of 25 books, Sacks published commentaries on the daily Jewish prayer book (siddur) and completed commentaries to the Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Pesach festival prayer-books (machzorim) . His other books include, &quot;Not in God&#x27;s Name: Confronting Religious Violence&quot;, and &quot;The Great Partnership: God, Science and the Search for Meaning&quot;. His books won literary awards, including the Grawemeyer Prize for Religion in 2004 for &quot;The Dignity of Difference&quot;, and a National Jewish Book Award in 2000 for &quot;A Letter in the Scroll&quot;. &quot;Covenant &amp; Conversation: Genesis&quot; was also awarded a National Jewish Book Award in 2009, and his commentary to the Pesach festival prayer book won the Modern Jewish Thought and Experience Dorot Foundation Award in the 2013 National Jewish Book Awards in the United States. His &quot;Covenant &amp; Conversation&quot; commentaries on the weekly Torah portion are read by thousands of people in Jewish communities around the world.

Sacks&#x27; contributions to wider British society have also been recognized. A regular contributor to national media, frequently appearing on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; or writing the Credo column or opinion pieces in &quot;The Times&quot;, Sacks was awarded The Sanford St Martin&#x27;s Trust Personal Award for 2013 for &quot;his advocacy of Judaism and religion in general&quot;. He was invited to the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton as a representative of the Jewish community.

At a Gala Dinner held in Central London in May 2013 to mark the completion of the Chief Rabbi&#x27;s time in office, the Prince of Wales called Sacks a &quot;light unto this nation&quot;, &quot;a steadfast friend&quot; and &quot;a valued adviser&quot; whose &quot;guidance on any given issue has never failed to be of practical value and deeply grounded in the kind of wisdom that is increasingly hard to come by&quot;.

===Chief Rabbi===
In his installation address upon succeeding Immanuel Jakobovits as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth in September 1991, Sacks called for a Decade of Renewal which would &quot;revitalize British Jewry&#x27;s great powers of creativity&quot;. He said this renewal should be based on five central values: &quot;love of every Jew, love of learning, love of God, a profound contribution to British society and an unequivocal attachment to Israel.&quot; Sacks said he wanted to be &quot;a catalyst for creativity, to encourage leadership in others, and to let in the fresh air of initiative and imagination&quot;. This led to a series of innovative communal projects including Jewish Continuity, a national foundation for Jewish educational programmes and outreach; the Association of Jewish Business Ethics; the Chief Rabbinate Awards for Excellence; the Chief Rabbinate Bursaries, and Community Development, a national scheme to enhance Jewish community life. The Chief Rabbi began his second decade of office with a call to &#x27;Jewish Responsibility&#x27; and a renewed commitment to the ethical dimension of Judaism. He was succeeded as chief rabbi by Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis on 1 September 2013.

==Philosophy and views==
Much has been written about Sacks&#x27; philosophical contribution to Judaism and beyond. These include: (1) a volume on his work entitled &quot;Universalizing Particularity&quot; that forms part of The Library of Contemporary Jewish Philosophers series, edited by Hava Tirosh-Samuelson and Aaron W. Hughes; (2) a book entitled &quot;Radical Responsibility&quot; edited by Michael J. Harris, Daniel Rynhold and Tamra Wright; and (3) a book entitled &quot;Morasha Kehillat Yaakov&quot; edited by Rabbi Michael Pollak and Dayan Shmuel Simons.

===Early influences===
In a pamphlet written to mark the completion of his time as Chief Rabbi entitled &quot;A Judaism Engaged with the World&quot;, Sacks cites three individuals who have had a profound impact on his own philosophical thinking.

The first figure was the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson who &quot;was fully aware of the problem of the missing Jews... inventing the idea, revolutionary in its time, of Jewish outreach... [He] challenged me to lead.&quot; Indeed, Sacks called him &quot;one of the greatest Jewish leaders, not just of our time, but of all time&quot;.

The second was Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik whom Sacks described as &quot;the greatest Orthodox thinker of the time [who] challenged me to think.&quot; Sacks argued that for Rav Soloveichik &quot;Jewish philosophy, he said, had to emerge from halakhah, Jewish law. Jewish thought and Jewish practice were not two different things but the same thing seen from different perspectives. Halakhah was a way of living a way of thinking about the world – taking abstract ideas and making them real in everyday life.&quot;

The third figure was Rabbi Nahum Rabinovitch, a former principal of the London School of Jewish Studies. Sacks called Rabinovitch &quot;One of the great Maimonidean scholars of our time, [who] taught us, his students, that Torah leadership demands the highest intellectual and moral courage. He did this in the best way possible: by personal example. The following thoughts, which are his, are a small indication of what I learned from him – not least that Torah is, among other things, a refusal to give easy answers to difficult questions.&quot;

===Universalism vs particularism===
Writing of Sacks as a rabbi, social philosopher, proponent of interfaith dialogue and a public intellectual, Tirosh-Samuelson and Hughes note that &quot;[Sacks&#x27;s] vision—informed as it is by the concerns of modern Orthodoxy—is paradoxically one of the most universalizing voices within contemporary Judaism. Sacks possesses a rare ability to hold in delicate balance the universal demands of the modern, multicultural world with the particularism associated with Judaism.&quot; This is a view supported by Rabbi Nathan Lopez Cardozo, who wrote in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; that Sacks&#x27;s &quot;confidence in the power of Judaism and its infinite wisdom enabled him to enter the lion&#x27;s den, taking on famous philosophers, scientists, religious thinkers and sociologists and showing them that Judaism had something to teach that they couldn&#x27;t afford to miss if they wanted to be at the forefront of philosophy and science.&quot; Harris and Rynhold, in their introduction to &quot;Radical Responsibility&quot;, argued: &quot;The special contribution made by the thought of Chief Rabbi Sacks is that it not only continues the venerable Jewish philosophical tradition of maintaining traditional faith in the face of external intellectual challenges, but also moves beyond this tradition by showing how core Jewish teachings can address the dilemmas of the secular world itself. What make Lord Sacks&#x27; approach so effective is that he is able to do so without any exception of the wider world taking on Judaism&#x27;s theological beliefs.&quot;

===Torah v&#x27;Chokhma===
The framework for Sacks&#x27; philosophical approach and his interaction between the universal and the particular is not too dissimilar from those positions adopted by other leading Orthodox thinkers of recent times. The favoured phrase of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch was &quot;Torah im derekh eretz&quot;, &#x27;Torah with general culture&#x27;; for Rabbi Norman Lamm it was &quot;Torah u-mada&quot;, &#x27;Torah and Science&#x27;. For Sacks, his favoured phrase was &quot;Torah vehokhmah&quot;, &#x27;Torah and Wisdom&#x27;. As noted in the introduction to &quot;Radical Responsibility&quot;: &quot;&quot;Torah&quot;, for Jonathan Sacks represents the particularistic, inherited teachings of Judaism, while &quot;hokhmah&quot; (wisdom) refers to the universal realm of the sciences and humanities.&quot; Framed in religious terms, as Sacks sets out in his book &quot;Future Tense&quot;: 
:&quot;Chokhmah is the truth we discover; Torah is the truth we inherit. Chokhmah is the universal language of humankind; Torah is the specific heritage of Israel. Chokhmah is what we attain by being in the image of God; Torah is what guides Jews as the people of God. Chokhmah is acquired by seeing and reasoning; Torah is received by listening and responding. Chokhmah tells us what is; Torah tells us what ought to be.&quot;

Tirosh-Samuelson and Hughes are of the opinion that whilst &quot;Torah v&#x27;Chokhmah&quot; is certainly a valid overarching framework, they note that Sacks&#x27; perspective is one rooted in modern orthodoxy: &quot;Although he will try to understand various denominations of Judaism, he is always quick to point out that Orthodoxy cannot recognize the legitimacy of interpretations of Judaism that abandon fundamental beliefs of halakhic (Jewish law) authority. Judaism that departs from the truth and acceptance of the halakha is a departure from authentic Judaism and, he reasons, is tantamount to the accommodation of secularism. So, while Sacks will develop a highly inclusive account of the world&#x27;s religions, there were times when he was critical of the denominations &quot;within&quot; Judaism.&quot;

===&quot;No one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth&quot;===
After the publication of his book &quot;The Dignity of Difference&quot;, a group of Haredi rabbis, most notably Rabbis Yosef Shalom Elyashiv and Bezalel Rakow, accused Sacks of heresy against what they consider the traditional Orthodox viewpoint. According to them, some words seemed to imply an endorsement of pure relativism between religions, and that Judaism is not the sole true religion, e.g. &quot;No one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth.&quot; This led him to rephrase more clearly some sentences in the book for its second edition, though he refused to recall books already in the stores.

In his &quot;Preface to the Second Edition&quot; of the book, Sacks wrote that certain passages in the book had been misconstrued: He had already explicitly criticised cultural and religious relativism in his book, and he did not deny Judaism&#x27;s uniqueness. He also stressed, however, that mainstream rabbinic teachings teach that wisdom, righteousness, and the possibility of a true relationship with God are all available in non-Jewish cultures and religions as an ongoing heritage from the covenant that God made with Noah and all his descendants, so the tradition teaches that one does not need to be Jewish to know God or truth, or to attain salvation. As this diversity of covenantal bonds implies, however, traditional Jewish sources do clearly deny that any one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth. Monopolistic and simplistic claims of universal truth he has characterized as imperialistic, pagan and Platonic, and not Jewish at all. The book received international acclaim, winning the Grawemeyer Award for Religion in 2004.

===Efforts to accommodate Haredi Jews===
A book by the British historian and journalist Meir Persoff, &quot;Another Way, Another Time&quot;, has argued that &quot;Sacks&#x27;s top priority has been staying in the good graces of the Haredi, or strictly Orthodox, faction, whose high birthrate has made it the fastest-growing component of British Jewry.&quot;

===Relationship with the non-Orthodox denominations===
In 1990, when he was Chief Rabbi-elect, he wrote to Sidney Brichto, a Liberal rabbi, about Brichto&#x27;s 1987 proposals. Brichto had advocated for a historical compromise between the Orthodox rabbinate and the non-Orthodox denominations. Among the proposals were radical changes to the conversion process for prospective converts in the non-Orthodox streams. These streams would stop processing their own conversions to Judaism. Instead, their prospective converts would have their status conferred on them by an Orthodox Beit Din. The Beit Din would be expected to show more leniency than usual, only expecting that those before them demonstrate knowledge of Orthodox practice rather than observance.

The proposal had been rejected by the incumbent Chief Rabbi, Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits. However, in his letter to Brichto, Sacks wrote: &quot;As soon as I read your article. ... I called it publicly &#x27;the most courageous statement by a non-Orthodox Jew this century&#x27;. I felt it was a genuine way forward. Others turned out not to share my view.&quot; He continued: &quot;It will be a while—18 months—before I take up office. But I believe we can still explore that way forward together. For if we do not move forward, I fear greatly for our community and for Am Yisrael.&quot;

Sacks provoked considerable controversy in the Anglo-Jewish community in 1996 when he refused to attend the funeral service of the late Reform Rabbi Hugo Gryn and for a private letter he had written in Hebrew, which (in translation) asserted that Auschwitz survivor Gryn was &quot;among those who destroy the faith&quot;, was leaked and published. He wrote further that he was an &quot;enemy&quot; of the Reform, Liberal and Masorti movements, leading some to reject the notion that he was &quot;Chief Rabbi&quot; for all Jews in Britain. He attended a memorial meeting for Gryn, a move that brought the wrath of some in the ultra-Orthodox community. Rabbi Dow Marmur, a Canada-based progressive Rabbi, argued that after attending the memorial service, Sacks then attempted to placate the ultra-Orthodox community, an attempt which Marmur has described as &quot;neurotic and cowardly.&quot;

Later, in a letter to &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in May 2013, Jackie Gryn, the widow of Rabbi Hugo Gryn, wrote: &quot;I feel the time has come for me to lay to rest, once and for all , the idea … that there ever was a &#x27;Hugo Gryn Affair&#x27;, as far as I am concerned, regarding the absence of the Chief Rabbi at the funeral of my late husband, Hugo… From the beginning, relations were cordial and sympathetic and have remained so&quot;, she wrote. &quot;There has never been any personal grievance between us concerning his non-attendance at the funeral, which promoted such venomous and divisive comments and regrettably continues to do so.&quot;

Sacks responded to the incident by rethinking his relationship with the non-Orthodox movements, eventually developing what he called the &quot;two principles&quot;. Responding to an interview shortly before his retirement, he wrote that &quot;You try and make things better in the future. As a result of the turbulence at that time, I was forced to think this whole issue through and I came up with these two principles; on all matters that affect us as Jews regardless of our religious differences we work together regardless of our religious differences, and on all things that touch our religious differences we agree to differ, but with respect. As a result of those two principles, relations between Reform and Orthodox have got much better and are actually a model for the rest of the Jewish world. Progressive rabbis sit with me on the top table of the Council of Christians and Jews, we stand together for Israel. All of this flowed from those two principles. Until then there had been a view never to do anything with the non-Orthodox movements but once you thought it through you saw that there were all sorts of opportunities.&quot;

Sacks years earlier (2004) drew some criticism when he and his beit din prevented the retired Rabbi Louis Jacobs, who had helped establish the British branch of the Masorti movement, from being called up for the reading of the Torah on the Saturday before his granddaughter&#x27;s wedding.

===Secularism and Europe&#x27;s changing demographics===
Sacks expressed concern at what he regarded as the negative effects of materialism and secularism in European society, arguing that they undermined the basic values of family life and lead to selfishness. In 2009, Sacks gave an address claiming that Europeans have chosen consumerism over the self-sacrifice of parenting children, and that &quot;the major assault on religion today comes from the neo-Darwinians&quot;. He argued that Europe is in population decline &quot;because non-believers lack shared values of family and community that religion has&quot;.

===Consumerism and Steve Jobs===
Sacks made remarks at an inter-faith reception attended by the Queen, in November 2011, in which he criticised what he believed to be the selfish consumer culture that has only brought unhappiness. &quot;The consumer society was laid down by the late Steve Jobs coming down the mountain with two tablets, iPad one and iPad two, and the result is that we now have a culture of iPod, iPhone, iTune, i, i, i. When you&#x27;re an individualist, egocentric culture and you only care about &#x27;I&#x27;, you don’t do terribly well.&quot; In a later statement, the Chief Rabbi&#x27;s office said &quot;The Chief Rabbi meant no criticism of either Steve Jobs personally or the contribution Apple has made to the development of technology in the 21st century.&quot;

===Position on gay marriage===
In July 2012 a group of prominent British Jews criticised Sacks for opposing plans to allow civil marriage for gays and lesbians. He said that he understood &quot;the fear that gays have of prejudice and persecution&quot; and went on to say, in a lecture on the institution of marriage, that a world that persecutes homosexuals is one &quot;to which we should never return.&quot;

===Interfaith dialogue===

Sacks was an advocate of interfaith dialogue and sat on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute.

===Politics in the United States===
In October 2017, Jonathan Sacks inveighed against a &quot;politics of anger&quot; he said was corroding the fabric of U.S. society. &quot;The politics of anger that&#x27;s emerged in our time is full of danger,&quot; Sacks said. He decried the breakdown of American society into narrower and narrower identities that nurtured a &quot;culture of grievances.&quot; Sacks warned that &quot;The social contract is still there, but the social covenant is being lost.&quot;

===On antisemitism===
In a June 2019 debate on anti-Semitism in the House of Lords, Sacks stated that &quot;there is hardly a country in the world, certainly not a single country in Europe, where Jews feel safe&quot; and that societies tolerating anti-Semitism had &quot;forfeited all moral credibility&quot;. Additionally, Sacks equated anti-Semitism to a &quot;mutating virus&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sacks married Elaine Taylor in 1970, and together they had three children: Joshua, Dina and Gila. He was a vegetarian.

==Death==
Sacks died in London on 7 November 2020, at the age of 72. He had been diagnosed with cancer a month earlier, having been twice previously treated for the disease.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Sacks&#x27; leadership had a &quot;profound impact on our whole country and across the world&quot;. Rabbi Meir Soloveichik wrote a tribute piece in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; entitled &quot;What Gentiles can Learn from Lord Sacks&quot;. Awarding the Genesis Prize Lifetime Achievement Award to Rabbi Sacks posthumously in late 2021, Israeli President Isaac Herzog paid tribute to him and praised him as “a master articulator of the Jewish foundation of universal values&quot; who &quot;unapologetically verbalized a proud, dignified Jewish identity.&quot;

<doc id="1135092" wikidata="Q610923" url="?curid=1135092" title="Sonic Battle">
<text>is a 2003 beat &#x27;em up video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Game Boy Advance. It is the second fighting game in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, the first game being &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot;. It was released in Japan in December 2003 and in North America and Europe in early 2004. The game received an indifferent response from critics.

==Gameplay==

Battles are fought in 3D arenas with up to four players. Each character has a set of attacks and abilities. Most attacks are used with B, including the combo (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Attack), Air Attack, Upper Attack (used to knock opponents straight up), Heavy Attack (used to knock opponents away), and Aim Attack (used to pursue an opponent after the Heavy Attack). The A button is used to jump, and the L button lets the player block attacks, or heal damage if the button is held. The playable characters also have unique special moves, the three types being Shot, Power, and Set. Shot moves center around using a projectile to damage the opponent from a distance. Power moves focus on dealing damage quickly in a single move. Trap moves generally involve using a type of bomb to surprise-attack the enemy. However, only a limited number of special moves can be selected. Shot, Power, and Trap must be allocated to three slots: Ground, Air, and Defend. The special move the player sets to Ground will be used when pressing R on the ground. The move the player sets to Air will be used when pressing R in mid-air. The last slot, Defend, has a different function; when a player sets a certain type of special move to Defend, then every time an enemy uses the same type of special moveset, it will automatically be blocked.

Each player has two vital stats, a health bar and an Ichikoro Gauge. When health is completely depleted, the player is KO&#x27;d and loses one life (in a survival match) or the one who KO&#x27;d them gets a point (in a KO match). The Ground, Air, and Defend settings are chosen at the beginning of the match, and every time the player respawns. As a player takes damage, blocks attacks, or heals, the Ichikoro Gauge fills up. When it is full, the next special move the player does will instantly KO anyone it hits. However, if they chose to defend against that type of special, or successfully block, their Ichikoro Gauge will be filled instantly. Players healing damage will also slowly fill up their Ichikoro Gauge, but are still vulnerable to attacks.

===Characters===
The game features ten playable characters. Eight are playable in the game&#x27;s Story Mode: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, Cream the Rabbit, and the original character Emerl. By defeating opponents in the Story Mode, the player will gain &quot;skill cards&quot;, which Emerl can equip to customize his moveset and utilize other characters&#x27; abilities. Two additional characters, E-102 Gamma and Chaos, can be unlocked for use in Battle Mode and Challenge Mode after they are defeated in Story Mode.

===Minigames===
The game includes five mini-games. The only mini-game available at the beginning of the game is &quot;Soniclash&quot;, in which players try to knock their opponents off the fighting arena to gather points. In &quot;Tails&#x27; Fly and Get&quot;, players fly around and try to collect more rings than their opponents. &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Mine Hunt&quot; is a single-player game based on the computer game &quot;Minesweeper&quot;. In &quot;Amy&#x27;s Treasure Island&quot;, players move around and search for emeralds. In &quot;Shadow&#x27;s Speed Demon&quot;, the players race against each other.

==Plot==
While studying the diary of his grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman learns of an artifact Gerald had unearthed: a 4000-year-old sentient weapon called the Gizoid created by an ancient civilization. Eggman attempts to get the dormant Gizoid to work properly, but is unsuccessful and abandons it at Emerald Beach. Sonic the Hedgehog finds the Gizoid, which activates and develops a link with him after Sonic demonstrates his abilities.

The Gizoid, which Sonic names Emerl due to its ability to use the Chaos Emeralds, demonstrates the power to perfectly replicate any moves it sees and quickly gets wrapped up in the affairs of Sonic&#x27;s friends, allies and rivals. Through his encounters with Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, Rouge The Bat, Knuckles The Echidna, Amy Rose, Cream The Rabbit, and Shadow The Hedgehog, Emerl learns of the world and of concepts like friendship. As they train together, the group discovers that Emerl becomes stronger and develops more sentience with each Chaos Emerald which he obtains, and begin searching for the remaining Emeralds to help the robot develop. While searching, they are repeatedly attacked by the forces of Eggman, who now wants to retrieve the weapon, including a rebuilt E-102 Gamma and a series of imperfect Emerl duplicates under the name &quot;E-121 Phi&quot;.

Eventually, all the Chaos Emeralds are obtained and Emerl achieves full sapience. In a last attempt, Eggman decides to lure Emerl onto his new Death Egg to capture him. The two battle, and Emerl emerges victorious, but Eggman uses his new Final Egg Blaster to force Emerl to override his link to Sonic with Eggman&#x27;s own. However, this overloads Emerl, deleting his personality and making him go haywire. The rogue Gizoid then turns the blaster towards the planet Earth, and Sonic is sent to stop him before the world is destroyed. Sonic defeats Emerl, who briefly reverts to his previous personality and bids his friends farewell before overloading with energy and exploding, leaving the shards of the Chaos Emeralds he acquired behind. Sonic returns home to his friends, who are saddened by the loss of Emerl. When asked if he believes Emerl is truly gone, Sonic reassures everyone that they will see him again someday.

==Development and release==
The game was officially announced at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and Tokyo Game Show, both of which featured playable demos. The game was released in late-2003 in Japan as part of the &quot;Year of Sonic&quot;, and early-2004 by THQ in the United States following a deal between both companies. Internationally, the game was co-published by Sega Europe and THQ.

==Reception==
The game received generally mixed reviews from critics, according to review aggregator site Metacritic. While some critics praised the game&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly deep arena-fighting gameplay&quot;, graphics, and multiplayer mode, others dismissed it for its &quot;limited moveset&quot; and use of 2D sprites on a 3D fighting arena.

IGN gave the game a positive review, saying &quot;It does try hard to be what &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; is, and even though the game doesn&#x27;t quite reach the same status Nintendo and HAL created for the Nintendo consoles, &quot;Sonic Battle&quot; has enough stuff to make it one of the top original fighters on the Game Boy Advance system.&quot; GameSpy also gave a positive review, saying &quot;A solid and pleasantly deep arena beat-&#x27;em-up with lots of longevity, and though the presence of the Hedgehog and his posse adds absolutely nothing to the game, it&#x27;s nice to see them getting work in these tough economic times.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave a more mixed review, saying, &quot;Moves are limited, but the overall experience is tons of fun.&quot; GamePro also gave a mixed review, criticizing the game&#x27;s story mode, saying &quot;The biggest problem with &quot;Sonic Battle&quot; is the poor game design in Story mode. Earning Skill Points, and thereby new abilities for Emerl the Robot, is a grueling ordeal.&quot;

<text>Sir John Bertrand Gurdon (born 2 October 1933) is a British developmental biologist, best known for his pioneering research in nuclear transplantation and cloning. 

Awarded the Lasker Award in 2009, in 2012, he and Shinya Yamanaka were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that mature cells can be converted to stem cells.

==Career==
Gurdon attended Edgeborough prep school before Eton College, where he ranked last out of the 250 boys in his year group at biology, and was in the bottom set in every other science subject. A schoolmaster wrote a report stating, &quot;I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.&quot; Gurdon explains it is the only document he ever framed; he also told a reporter: &quot;When you have problems like an experiment doesn&#x27;t work, which often happens, it&#x27;s nice to remind yourself that perhaps after all you are not so good at this job and the schoolmaster may have been right!&quot;

Gurdon went up to Christ Church, Oxford, to read classics then switched to zoology, graduating as MA. For his DPhil degree he studied nuclear transplantation in a frog species of the genus &quot;Xenopus&quot;, supervised by Dr Michail Fischberg at Oxford University. After pursuing further postdoctoral work at Caltech, he returned to England where his early posts were in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford (1962–71).

Gurdon spent much of his research career at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (1971–83) and then in the Department of Zoology (1983–present). In 1989, he became a founding member of the Wellcome/CRC Institute for Cell Biology and Cancer (later Wellcome/CR UK) at Cambridge, becoming its chairman until 2001. He served as a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 1991–1995, then Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, from 1995 to 2002.

Gurdon married Jean Elizabeth Margaret Curtis, by whom he has a son and a daughter.

==Research==
===Nuclear transfer===
In 1958, Gurdon, then at the University of Oxford, successfully cloned a frog using intact nuclei from the somatic cells of a &quot;Xenopus&quot; tadpole. This work was an important extension of work of Briggs and King in 1952 on transplanting nuclei from embryonic blastula cells and the successful induction of polyploidy in the stickleback, &quot;Gasterosteus aculatus&quot;, in 1956 by Har Swarup reported in &quot;Nature&quot;. At that time he could not conclusively show that the transplanted nuclei derived from a fully differentiated cell. This was finally shown in 1975 by a group working at the Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland. They transplanted a nucleus from an antibody-producing lymphocyte (proof that it was fully differentiated) into an enucleated egg and obtained living tadpoles.

Gurdon&#x27;s experiments captured the attention of the scientific community as it altered the notion of development and the tools and techniques he developed for nuclear transfer are still used today. The term clone (from the ancient Greek word &quot;&quot; (klōn, &quot;twig&quot;)) had already been in use since the beginning of the 20th century in reference to plants. In 1963 the British biologist J. B. S. Haldane, in describing Gurdon&#x27;s results, became one of the first to use the word &quot;clone&quot; in reference to animals.

===Messenger RNA expression===
Gurdon and colleagues also pioneered the use of &quot;Xenopus&quot; (genus of highly aquatic frog) eggs and oocytes to translate microinjected messenger RNA molecules, a technique which has been widely used to identify the proteins encoded and to study their function.

===Recent research===
Gurdon&#x27;s recent research has focused on analysing intercellular signalling factors involved in cell differentiation, and on elucidating the mechanisms involved in reprogramming the nucleus in transplantation experiments, including the role of histone variants, and demethylation of the transplanted DNA.

==Politics and religion==
Gurdon has stated that he is politically &quot;middle of the road&quot;, and religiously agnostic because &quot;there is no scientific proof either way&quot;. During his time as Master of Magdalene, Gurdon caused some controversy by suggesting that Fellows might occasionally be allowed to deliver &quot;an address on anything they would like to talk about&quot; in college chapel services. In an interview with EWTN.com, Gurdon declared &quot;I&#x27;m what you might call liberal-minded. I&#x27;m not a Roman Catholic. I&#x27;m a Christian, of the Church of England.&quot;

==Honours and awards==
Gurdon was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1971, before appointment as Knight Bachelor in 1995.

Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1980, and the American Philosophical Society in 1983, since 2005 he has been an Honorary Member of the American Association of Anatomists. 

In 2004, the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Institute for Cell Biology and Cancer was renamed the Gurdon Institute in his honour. He was awarded the 2009 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award and in 2014 delivered the Harveian Oration at the Royal College of Physicians. In 2017, Gurdon received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. A Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) and Fellow of the Zoological Society (FZS), he has received honorary doctorates including Hon DSc (Oxon) and Hon ScD (Cantab) as well as many other awards and medals. 

In 1989 he was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine “for his introduction of the xenopus oocyte into molecular biology and his demonstration that the nucleus of a differentiated cell and of the egg differ in expression but not in the content of genetic material”.

===Nobel Prize===
In 2012, Gurdon was awarded, jointly with Shinya Yamanaka, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine &quot;for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent&quot;. His Nobel Lecture was called &quot;The Egg and the Nucleus: A Battle for Supremacy&quot;.

<doc id="1135105" wikidata="Q21118" url="?curid=1135105" title="Acanthophippium">
<text>Acanthophippium is a genus of orchid with thirteen species (family Orchidaceae). The name of this genus is derived from the Greek words &quot;acanthos&quot; (&quot;spiny&quot;) and &quot;ephippion&quot; (&quot;saddle&quot;), referring to the saddle-like labellum of the plants.

This terrestrial and sometimes myco-heterotrophic genus of sympodial orchids is distributed from the Indian subcontinent to Taiwan, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the southwest Pacific.

The terrestrial species are up to 80 cm tall. They have short rhizomes. The oblong and fleshy pseudobulbs are up to 25 cm tall. They produce at their apex 2 to 3 large , , parallel-veined leaves, which can be up to 65 cm long.

The erect inflorescence arises laterally from the pseudobulbs, with 3 to 6 flowers, by large, bracts. The flowers are prominent, large, cup- or urn-shaped, fleshy, waxy, and about 4 cm long. They resemble a tulip, a most unusual shape for an orchid. The flowers have a wide range of colors, from dull yellow to red to shades of orange and pink, marked with stripes or spots. The blossoms are usually odiferous with a very strong fragrance.

This genus is allied to genera &quot;Calanthe&quot;, &quot;Cephalantheropsis&quot;, &quot;Phaius&quot;, and &quot;Spathoglottis&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Acanthophippium&quot; was first described by Carl Ludwig Blume in 1825. He used the spelling with an &quot;o&quot;. Many sources have since spelt the name &quot;Acanthephippium&quot; (i.e. with an &quot;e&quot;). This is regarded as an orthographic variant by the International Plant Names Index. The original spelling is used by sources such as the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.

<text>Krieger is a lunar impact crater on the eastern part of the Oceanus Procellarum. It is located to the north-northwest of the flooded crater Prinz, and north-northeast of the prominent ray crater Aristarchus. To the northwest lies the small Wollaston. The crater was formally named in 1935.

In the past the floor of Krieger has been flooded by basaltic lava, leaving only a low, circular, somewhat polygonal ridge formed by the rim. The southern rim is broken across by the small Van Biesbroeck, and there is a small gap in the western rim. A meandering rille leads away from this break toward the northwest.

Krieger is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Nearby craters==
Two tiny craters next to the eastern rim have been designated Rocco and Ruth. Rocco was previously designated as Krieger D before being named by the IAU.

The nearby surface to the southwest contains a number of rilles belonging to the Rimae Aristarchus and Rimae Prinz rille systems. Further to the east-southeast are the Montes Harbinger mountains.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Krieger.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Krieger B — &quot;See&quot; Van Biesbroeck (crater).

<text>Rainy River is a town in north-western Ontario, Canada, southeast of Lake of the Woods. Rainy River is situated on the eponymous Rainy River, which forms part of the Ontario–Minnesota segment of the Canada–US border. Across the river is the town of Baudette, Minnesota. The two towns are connected by the Baudette – Rainy River International Bridge. Rainy River is at the northwestern terminus of Highway 11.

Rainy River was frequently thought to have been the northwestern terminus of Yonge Street (which runs north from Toronto) due to it being incorrectly thought as being synonymous with the entire length of Highway 11. Because of this incorrect conflation, Yonge Street was considered the longest street in the world and was listed as such in the Guinness Book of World Records until 1999. Highway 11 is named Atwood Avenue through Rainy River, although the town and the City of Toronto both maintain commemorative markers at each end.

==History==
From Rainy Lake, derived from the French . Appears as Rain Lake in 1813 Gazetteer. A post office named Rainy River was established in 1886. Incorporated as the town of Rainy River in 1904, the community was first formed around 1895 as part of mill development by a group of lumbermen along the northeast shore of the Rainy River. Their mill and related developments were located about 2 km from the current town center. In 1898 their mill was purchased by the Beaver Mills Lumber Company. The small village took the name Beaver Mills until it was incorporated as a town. In 1901 the Ontario and Rainy River Railway completed a bridge connecting Minnesota, United States to Ontario, but the Beaver Mills town site was in the way of the eastern end. The company developed a new town further upriver, between the two large lumber mills. The only method of transport at the time was by steamship so parts of the bridge were shipped and arrived addressed to &quot;Rainy River&quot;. The town eventually accepted this as their name.

The lumber industry and associated mills stimulated growth of the town, as did the Railway. In 1910, a forest fire known as the Great Fire of 1910, originating in northern Minnesota, swept north and destroyed the mills. On the southern, US side of the river, the villages of Baudette and Spooner were destroyed in the fire. Most survivors from the US-side survived because residents from Rainy River backed a train of box cars across the bridge and pulled the people north to safety. After the fire, the mill industry relocated. The population of Rainy River quickly declined from more than 2000 people to less than 800. No alternative economy was developed to support a larger population.

The town of Rainy River pivoted industry to railway and hunting/fishing tourism. But the railroad and the growing hunting/fishing tourism industry have helped the town to survive. At one time it was the site of a rail round house and associated jobs. In the 1960s the Rainy River Boat company operated here, and in the 1970s Arctic Cat Apparel manufactured related clothing. The decline of these industries has greatly affected the remote town.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Rainy River had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
== Government ==
=== Federal representation ===
The town is in the Canadian electoral district of Thunder Bay—Rainy River, which elects one Member of Parliament (MP) to represent it in Parliament.

=== City Mayor and Council ===
The city is headed by Rainy River Mayor and six elected city councillors.

<text>Knebworth House is an English country house in the parish of Knebworth in Hertfordshire, England. It is a Grade II* listed building. Its gardens are also listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In its surrounding park are the medieval St. Mary&#x27;s Church and the Lytton family mausoleum. It was the seat of the Earl of Lytton (also Viscount Knebworth), and now the house of the family of the Baron Cobbold of Knebworth.

The grounds are home to the Knebworth Festival, a recurring open-air rock and pop concert held since 1974.

==History==

The home of the Lytton family since 1490, when Thomas Bourchier sold the reversion of the manor to Sir Robert Lytton, Knebworth House was originally a red-brick Late Gothic manor house, built round a central court as an open square. In 1813–16 the house was reduced to its west wing, which was remodelled in a Tudor Gothic style by John Biagio Rebecca for Mrs Bulwer-Lytton, and then was transformed in 1843-45 by Henry Edward Kendall Jr. into the present Tudor Gothic structure.

Knebworth&#x27;s most famous resident was Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803–1873), the Victorian author, dramatist and statesman, who embellished the gardens in a formal Italianate fashion. The 1st Baron&#x27;s great-grandson Neville (1879–1951) married Judith Blunt, a well known horse breeder who inherited Crabbet Arabian Stud in 1917 and devoted her life to it. In 1913–1914 the house was leased for £3,000 per year by Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia and his morganatic wife Natalia Brasova.

Much of the interior of Knebworth House was redesigned by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who married Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton (1874–1964) – he simplified the main parterre. Lady Emily was the daughter of the 1st Earl of Lytton, who served as Viceroy of India between 1876 and 1880. A herb garden, with an interlaced quincunx design, was drawn by Gertrude Jekyll in 1907, although not planted until 1982. The grounds are also open to the public.

The 3rd Baron Cobbold lives at the house with his family. After a career in the film industry in Los Angeles, he lets production companies film on location in the house and gardens. The grounds include tourist attractions such as an adventure playground and dinosaur park and host various events including classic car rallies.

==Music festival==
Beginning in 1974, a recurring open-air rock and pop concert known as the Knebworth Festival has been held in the grounds. The festival first occurred in July 1974 when The Allman Brothers Band, The Doobie Brothers and other artists played to an audience of 60,000 people. Over the years the festival has featured major artists such as Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Queen (their 1986 concert at the venue their last with Freddie Mercury), Paul McCartney, Genesis, Mike Oldfield, The Beach Boys, Deep Purple, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Dire Straits, Robbie Williams, Oasis and Liam Gallagher.

<doc id="1135138" wikidata="Q465610" url="?curid=1135138" title="Marcella Detroit">
<text>Marcella Levy (born June 21, 1952), known professionally as Marcy Levy and (later in her career) Marcella Detroit, is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. She co-wrote the 1977 Eric Clapton hit &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot; and released her debut studio album &quot;Marcella&quot; in 1982. She joined Shakespears Sister in 1988 with ex-Bananarama member Siobhan Fahey. Their first two studio albums, &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; (1989), and &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot; (1992), both reached the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart. Detroit sang the lead vocals on their biggest hit, &quot;Stay&quot;, which spent eight consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart in 1992. Detroit left the band in 1993 and had a UK top 20 hit with &quot;I Believe&quot; in 1994. She formed the Marcy Levy Band in 2002, and finished third in the 2010 ITV series &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot;.

==Career==
===1970–1987: Early career and &quot;Marcella&quot;===
Detroit-born Marcy Levy began playing for different bands in her home city during the early 1970s. The first major act she worked with was Bob Seger who signed her band &quot;Julia&quot; up to tour with him. She sang backing vocals on his studio album &quot;Back in &#x27;72&quot; (1973), which was recorded at Leon Russell&#x27;s Grand Lake studio. Detroit was then asked by Russell to join him on tour, which she later did. After moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma to further pursue her musical career, she and her then-current band were hired by Eric Clapton for touring. She sang backing and group vocals on Clapton&#x27;s studio album &quot;There&#x27;s One in Every Crowd&quot; (1975), and toured and recorded with him for the next four years. While working with Clapton, she sang backing vocals on some of his most enduring songs, including &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot; (which she co-wrote), &quot;Promises&quot;, and &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;. She co-wrote and sang lead vocals on &quot;Roll It&quot; on Clapton&#x27;s studio album &quot;Backless&quot; (1978) and dueted with Clapton on &quot;The Core&quot;, which she also co-wrote with Clapton. During this period, she began working on her debut solo studio album with producer David Foster in the mid-late 1970s signed to RSO Records. For unknown reasons however, the album was shelved and remained unfinished. Marcy later stopped working with Clapton to focus more on her own solo career, but rejoined him when they performed at Live Aid where she added backing vocals. Whilst working on her debut studio album, she was singing and songwriting for numerous artists including Aretha Franklin, Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager, Stanley Clarke, Chaka Khan, Belinda Carlisle, and Al Jarreau.

Marcy duetted with Alice Cooper on his 1978 studio album &quot;From the Inside&quot; (producer David Foster) on the song &quot;Millie and Billie&quot;. She provided backing vocals on the 1980 hit &quot;Lookin&#x27; for Love&quot; (#5 Pop and #1 Country) by Johnny Lee.
Also in 1980, she sang a duet with Robin Gibb, &quot;Help Me!&quot;, which was featured on the official soundtrack of the film &quot;Times Square&quot;. The song was released as a single, and reached number 50 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. She also sang a duet on Jimmy Ruffin&#x27;s studio album &quot;Sunrise&quot;; &quot;Where Do I Go&quot;, and in 1981 was featured on the official soundtrack of &quot;American Pop&quot; on &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;. During this period, Detroit was signed to Epic Records and released her debut studio album, &quot;Marcella&quot; in 1982. The album failed to appear on any major charts, and after the commercial failure of the album, Epic Records refused Detroit tour allowance with John Mellencamp, and she was later dropped by the label. She wrote and provided backing vocals for &quot;Tangled in Love&quot; with Richard Feldman, which appeared on Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1985 studio album &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;. Following this, she was asked by Clapton to start to work with him again, and after another year of touring with him, she once more left to pursue her own solo career. Detroit (credited as Marcy Levy) released an LP together with Diane Reeves in 1985, titled &quot;Ballerina&quot;, where she performs three songs, &quot;Ballerina&quot;, &quot;Pretty Polly&quot; and &quot;Always a Woman in Love&quot;. Also credited as Marcy Levy, she sang a duet with Max Carl, &quot;Come and Follow Me&quot; for the movie &quot;Short Circuit 1&quot; in 1986; however no movie soundtrack album was ever released. Detroit was featured in 1988 on the official soundtrack of &quot;Mac and Me&quot;, on the song &quot;You Knew What You Were Doing&quot;.

===1988–1993: Shakespears Sister===
Detroit met Bananarama member Siobhan Fahey through a friend in common and songwriting partner Richard Feldman. At the time, Fahey had been contemplating leaving the band for her solo brainchild project Shakespears Sister. Feldman had invited Detroit as a songwriting aid. During this period, Fahey suggested to Detroit that she change her name to &quot;give me a sort of new lease of life and to get me disassociated with my background vocal past/entity&quot;. Detroit continued to work as a &quot;hired hand&quot; until Fahey&#x27;s husband Dave Stewart of Eurythmics suggest the two form a band, which was backed by Feldman, Fahey&#x27;s management and her record company, London Records. Detroit officially became a member of the band after the release of the first Shakespears Sister single, &quot;Break My Heart (You Really) / Heroine&quot;. Their second single &quot;You&#x27;re History&quot; reached the top 10 in the UK, as did their debut studio album &quot;Sacred Heart&quot;, which was certified Gold by the BPI. Two further singles were released from &quot;Sacred Heart&quot;, &quot;Run Silent&quot; and &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, both of which failed to peak within the UK top 50.

In late 1991, Shakespears Sister released the first single from their second studio album &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;, which was also a commercial failure, failing to peak within the UK top 50. The second single however, &quot;Stay&quot;, marked Shakespears Sister&#x27;s first and only number one, staying at the top of the UK charts for eight consecutive weeks, and also found similar success in international charts. &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot; was released the following month, and was certified 2× Platinum by the BPI. The duo continued to enjoy success with further singles from &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot;; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; peaked at number seven, &quot;Hello (Turn Your Radio On)&quot; at number 14, and a re-release of &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot; at number 32.

During this period, however, tensions began to arise between the two. A concert at the Royal Albert Hall was cancelled due to Fahey&#x27;s own personal issues at the time, and the two decided to put Shakespears Sister on hiatus for Detroit to release her new solo studio album, which she had been working on at the time, and also for Fahey to &quot;take that time off to be with her family.&quot; During this period, the fifth and final single from &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot; was released; &quot;My 16th Apology&quot;, and due to both members being unable to promote it, it was a commercial failure, reaching number 63 on the UK charts. Detroit found out that Fahey had ended her partnership with her at the 1993 Ivor Novello Awards ceremony through Fahey&#x27;s publisher when &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot; won &quot;Best Contemporary Collection of Songs&quot;. Detroit and Fahey did not speak to or see each other for 25 years, before eventually meeting up and talking again in 2018.

===1994–2001: &quot;Jewel&quot;, &quot;Feeler&quot;, and &quot;Dancing Madly Sideways&quot;===
After leaving Shakespears Sister in 1993, Detroit began her own solo career also with London Records. Her second studio album, and her first since leaving the duo, &quot;Jewel&quot; was released in March 1994 preceded by &quot;I Believe&quot;, which reached number 11 in the UK. The album itself reached number 15 and was certified silver by the BPI. &quot;Jewel&quot; received mixed reviews from critics – Aaron Badgley from AllMusic commented &quot;[Chris Thomas] seems to steer Marcella into mid-&#x27;90s dance grooves, which does not always fit her own distinctive sound&quot;. Three more singles followed; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot; (a duet with Elton John), &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot;, and &quot;Perfect World&quot;, which peaked at number 24, 33, and 134 respectively.

Detroit left London Records sometime in 1995. She released her third studio album &quot;Feeler&quot; in September 1996 under various labels; in the UK it was released under AAA Records, in some European territories under Mega Records, in others Silvertone Records. The album did not chart in the UK, or any other territories except Japan, where under Sony Records it peaked at number 82. Four singles were released, &quot;I Hate You Now...&quot;, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Mother&quot;, &quot;Boy&quot;, and &quot;Flower&quot;. &quot;I Hate You Now...&quot; and &quot;Boy&quot; peaked at number 107, and 102 respectively. A live album, &quot;Without Medication Plus MTV &quot;Buzz Live&quot;&quot;, was released promotionally in Japan in 1996. In the same year, she guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; as an angel. Over the course of the two episodes, five original songs by Detroit feature in numerous scenes, which were later released in 1999 on &quot;Abfab Songs&quot;. The same year, Detroit released &quot;Demoz&quot;, a double-CD collection of demos. Her fourth solo album, &quot;Dancing Madly Sideways&quot; was released in July 2001 under Detroit&#x27;s own independent label Banned Records, which would later be retitled Lofi Records. The album was preceded by one single, &quot;Lust for Like&quot;, and a three-track sampler EP, &quot;Limited Edition&quot;. None of these releases charted internationally. In 2002, she featured on Aurora&#x27;s single &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;.

===2002–2008: Marcy Levy Band===
After &quot;Dancing Madly Sideways&quot;, Detroit formed her self-titled blues band (named after her birth name and original stage name); the Marcy Levy Band, with Michael Fell on harmonica, Job Striles on guitar, Rick Reed on bass, and Max Bangwell on drums. Detroit described the project as &quot;getting back to my roots, the stuff that inspired me in the first place. So I decided to contact all my blues friends and do a record.&quot; Their debut EP &quot;Button Fly Blues&quot; received a limited release under Handmade Records, Detroit and the band&#x27;s only release with the label. During this era, she toured with Carlos Guitarlos, and began songwriting for artists including Charlotte Church and Alex Parks, among others. The Marcy Levy Band released their debut studio album &quot;The Upside of Being Down&quot; in July 2006 under Detroit&#x27;s independent label Lofi Records. In April 2007, she featured on Loverush U.K.&#x27;s single &quot;Mystery to Me&quot;. In 2008, she also featured on &quot;My Friend Misery&quot; by Vacuum.

===2009–2018: Popstar to Operastar, &quot;The Vehicle&quot;, and &quot;Gray Matterz&quot;===

In 2009, the Marcy Levy Band split. The same year, Detroit featured on Alex Dixon&#x27;s – grandson of Willie Dixon – album &quot;Rising from the Bushes&quot; on two tracks: &quot;Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Paint You a Picture&quot;. , Detroit had been working on two separate solo studio albums; &quot;Skin I&#x27;m In&quot;, produced by Larry Klein, and &quot;The Vehicle&quot;, a more personal project, and is to coincide with the release of her autobiography of the same name. In January 2010 Detroit participated in Series 1 of the British ITV1 celebrity reality television show &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot;. She finished as a joint semi-finalist alongside Kym Marsh in week 5 of the competition. When the voting statistics were released it was revealed that she had more votes than Marsh; therefore she came third overall. She was also only three percent behind Darius Campbell Danesh, who went on to become the winner of the season. In 2010, she released a single titled &quot;All is Forgiven&quot;, based on the Irish Prayer, which has since been removed from the iTunes Store. In November 2011, Detroit released her first Christmas EP &quot;Happy Holiday&quot;, consisting of classic covers and an original song of the same name.

In May 2012, Detroit released her first single in two years; &quot;Madison&#x27;s Light&quot; as a tribute to her niece, who died at the age of five months. Five months after the release of the single, Detroit officially set up the not-for-profit charity organization &quot;The Madison Morr Foundation&quot; for children in need. Detroit was featured on the song &quot;Yell Cut&quot; among numerous artists including Anthony Costa, originally written by aspiring singer Natasha Anastasi, who was killed in a car accident in 2005. The song was recorded for and included on Anastasi&#x27;s tribute album &quot;Natasha&quot;, released in June 2012 consisting of songs performed by Anastasi and other artists. In August 2012, Detroit announced James Gadson would be featuring on her &quot;new album&quot; (which one hasn&#x27;t been specified) and would be performing on her tour with her, which opened on September 20, 2012 in Largo, Florida. In September 2012, she released a new single &quot;Love, Faith, and Hope&quot;, which was intended to be the official anthem of the Belgrade Pride festival, which was cancelled by the Serbian government due to security reasons. In November 2012, Detroit released her second Christmas EP, entitled &quot;Holiday 2012&quot;, and confirmed on her official Facebook page that both studio albums (&quot;Skin I&#x27;m In&quot; and &quot;The Vehicle&quot;) were completed, and awaiting release for early 2013.

It was announced in December 2012 that Detroit was expecting to release both albums internationally on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 2013. She was developing an official app, to be released free, containing exclusive information &quot;you won&#x27;t be able to find anywhere else&quot;. A supporting tour backed by London session organisation The AllStars Collective, the Vehicle Jump Start Tour, opened on April 28, 2013 in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom. Detroit announced in February 2013 that she had signed with Right Recordings, a UK-based label with &quot;major distribution through Universal&quot;.

=== 2019–present: Shakespears Sister reunion===
In May 2019, it was announced that Detroit would reunite with Fahey as Shakespears Sister on stage later in the year. A UK tour, titled Shakespears Sister Ride Again, was announced during the same month, and was launched in Nottingham on 31 October 2019, before playing 13 other gigs across the UK during the following month. A new single by the band, &quot;All the Queen&#x27;s Horses&quot;, was released on 15 May, with an accompanying music video. This was followed by the compilation album, &quot;Singles Party&quot;, in July 2019.

The duo performed &quot;Stay&quot; on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; on 10 May 2019; their first TV performance together since 1993. They also announced that they were recording an EP of new material. which turned out to be the &quot;Ride Again&quot; mini-album, which charted at number 69 in the UK Albums chart in November 2019.

In 2021, Detroit appeared on a cover version of Robbie Williams&#x27; &quot;Angels&quot;, recorded for charity with Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet, Jools Holland, Clem Burke of Blondie and Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols. In June 2021, she talked about her time working with Eric Clapton and Alice Cooper on an episode of &quot;Sounds of the 70s&quot; with Johnnie Walker on BBC Radio 2.

<doc id="1135148" wikidata="Q1342936" url="?curid=1135148" title="Mo Johnston">
<text>Maurice John Giblin Johnston (born 13 April 1963) is a Scottish football player and coach. Johnston, who played as a forward, started his senior football career with Partick Thistle in 1981. He moved to Watford in 1983, where he scored 23 league goals and helped them reach the 1984 FA Cup Final. In 1984 he joined Celtic and scored 72 goals in 128 matches, won the Scottish Cup in 1985 and the Scottish league championship in 1986. Johnston signed for Nantes in 1987. He returned to Glasgow with Rangers in 1989, becoming the second player to cross the Old Firm divide since World War II (Alfie Conn was first) and the first open Catholic to play for Rangers since World War I.

Johnston won two Scottish league titles with Rangers, scoring 46 goals in 100 games. He later played for Everton, Hearts, Falkirk and American Major League Soccer (MLS) side Kansas City Wizards. Johnston received his first international cap for Scotland in 1984, when he was at Watford. He scored 14 goals in 38 appearances for Scotland, including one at the 1990 World Cup.

After retiring as a football player in 2001, Johnston went on to coach in MLS. He was most recently the manager and later Director of Soccer at MLS club Toronto FC before he parted company with them on 14 September 2010.

==Club career==

===Partick Thistle===

Johnston started his career in 1981 with Partick Thistle and scored 41 goals in two and a half seasons there.

===Watford===
Johnston then moved on to English club Watford for a fee of £210,000 in November 1983, when they were struggling against relegation from the First Division a season after finishing second. His arrival revived their season as they recovered well to finish mid table, as he scored 20 goals in just 29 league games. He also helped them reach their first ever FA Cup final, which they lost 2–0 to Everton. He began the 1984–85 season still at Vicarage Road and got three goals in nine First Division games before returning to Scotland.

===Celtic===
Johnston scored 14 league goals in 27 games during his first season at the club. In 1985–86 he scored 15 goals from 32 Premier Division games as Celtic won the league title. During the 1986–87 season Johnston scored 23 goals from 40 games.

===Nantes===
Johnston moved on to French club Nantes in 1987 and scored 22 goals in two seasons there. After initially claiming he would never return to Scotland, Johnston reconsidered and appeared at a press conference to announce that he would sign for Celtic at the end of his contract with Nantes.

===Rangers===
In July 1989, Johnston opted not to return to Celtic (who had recently sold his replacement Frank McAvennie back to West Ham United) and instead joined Graeme Souness&#x27;s Rangers. From the early 20th century onwards, Catholics had not been knowingly signed by Rangers, nor employed in other prominent roles as an &#x27;unwritten rule&#x27;. Johnston was &quot;their first major Roman Catholic signing&quot;. He was the highest-profile Catholic to sign for the club since the World War I era, though other Catholics had signed for Rangers before. The move angered both Celtic and Rangers supporters. A handful of Rangers fans burned scarves and threatened to hand in season tickets over the signing but attendances held firm while Celtic fans referred to Johnston as &quot;Judas&quot;. Rangers&#x27; kitman Jimmy Bell protested by making Johnston arrange his own kit and withholding from him the chocolate bars dispensed to other players until he scored against Celtic. He won over a lot of Rangers fans in November 1989, when he scored a late winning goal in an Old Firm derby match.

===Everton===
On 18 November 1991, Johnston signed to Everton for £1.5M, forming a three-man strikeforce alongside Tony Cottee and Peter Beardsley. He scored seven goals in 21 league games as Everton finished mid table in the 1991–92 campaign of the First Division. Johnston scored three goals in 13 games as Everton finished 13th in the first season of the new Premier League, losing his place in the first team to new signing Paul Rideout. One of his goals in the 1992–93 season came in a 3–0 away win over Manchester United in the second game of the Premier League season.

Despite the departure of Peter Beardsley to Newcastle United in the close season, Johnston remained out of the team during the 1993–94 campaign as manager Howard Kendall reverted to the traditional 4–4–2 formation and partnered Tony Cottee with Paul Rideout in attack.

In October 1993, Johnston was given a free transfer when attempts to sell him failed.

===Return to Scottish football===
Johnston returned to Scotland with Edinburgh club Hearts, making 31 appearances in his first season and scoring four goals. He found himself out of the team the following season and was given another free transfer in February 1995 after a long dispute over the settlement of his contract. Joining Falkirk, he scored one goal in the remainder of that season and five in the next season as Falkirk were relegated from the Scottish Premier Division.

===MLS===
In 1996 Johnston moved to the United States and Major League Soccer, signing with the Kansas City Wiz (later renamed the Wizards). He scored 31 goals in 149 games for the club, adding a goal in 15 playoff games. He was part of the Wizards team that won the MLS Cup in 2000.

==International career==
Mo Johnston made his debut with the Scotland national team in 1984 and played regularly under manager Andy Roxburgh following his appointment in July 1986.

He had been expected to make the squad for Mexico 86 but was dropped by Alex Ferguson (caretaker manager until the end of the World Cup after the death of Jock Stein in September 1985) after a late night incident during Scotland&#x27;s preparations for their play-off against Australia in November 1985, in which Johnston had disturbed a member of the coaching staff in his hotel room. In Ferguson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Managing My Life&quot;, which was published 14 years later, Ferguson stated that he had already warned Johnston about his conduct after he and teammate Frank McAvennie had bought drinks for themselves, fellow Scotland teammates and a group of young women in the hotel bar.

He played a part in getting Scotland to Italia 90 but retired from international competition after their early elimination. He briefly returned to the national side team for several Euro qualifiers in late 1991 but got injured against Switzerland and finally, in 1992 after scoring 14 goals in 38 caps, permanently retired from the national team. He was in the starting lineup for all three of Scotland&#x27;s matches in the 1990 World Cup, scoring a penalty kick against Sweden.

==Managerial career==
Johnston retired after the 2001 season, and from 2003 to 2005 was an assistant coach to Bob Bradley for the MetroStars. After Bradley was fired with three games left in the 2005 season, Johnston was named interim head coach. With a record to end the season of two wins and a tie, he led the team to the playoffs and was promoted to the full-time position with re-branded New York Red Bulls after the season. On 27 June 2006, after a 2-3-7 start to the 2006 season, Johnston was fired.

On 22 August 2006, Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE); owners of MLS club Toronto FC, announced Johnston as Head Coach beginning their inaugural 2007 season. Before the start of the 2008 season, it was announced that Johnston was moving upstairs to fill the role of Director of Football, though he retained the title of manager, while John Carver took over coaching duties at the time. Johnston earned himself the name &quot;Trader Mo&quot; because in the first half of the first season alone he had traded 9 players. Johnston&#x27;s tenure as Director of Soccer ended when he was fired, along with head coach Preki, on 14 September 2010. Johnston&#x27;s regular season record as Director of Soccer Operations was 32-51-31.

<doc id="1135151" wikidata="Q1180075" url="?curid=1135151" title="De La Rue (crater)">
<text>De La Rue is the remnant of a lunar impact crater, or possibly several merged craters, creating a formation sometimes called a walled plain. It lies in the northeastern part of the Moon on the near side, and so appears foreshortened due to its location. This formation lies to the north-northwest of the prominent crater Endymion, just beyond the eastern extreme of Mare Frigoris. The crater Strabo intrudes into the northern part of De La Rue&#x27;s northern rim, and the smaller Thales is attached to the northwestern part of the wall.

The crater was named after Warren De la Rue, who took some of the first photos of the moon.

The perimeter of De La Rue is a disintegrated mass of hills, irregular ground, and notches from old craters. The rim is generally rounded along the northwest half, while a formation to the southeast intrudes into the crater resulting in a somewhat straightened wall along that flank. The overall result is a somewhat pear-shaped perimeter. There are remnants of small craters along the south-southeast rim, and several ghost-crater rims lie along the interior floor beside the northern inner wall.

Near the midpoint of the relatively flat interior floor is the bowl-shaped satellite crater De La Rue J. There is rough ground attached to the southern rim of this crater, and low hills just to the west. The inner floor is rougher along the southeast side. The remaining floor is marked by many tiny craterlets, with a notable pair in the northeast part of the interior.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to De La Rue.

She is the author of several acclaimed novels, including &quot;The Foreign Student&quot; (1998), &quot;American Woman&quot; (2003), and &quot;Trust Exercise&quot; (2019), which won the National Book Award for Fiction.

==Early life and education==
Choi was born in South Bend, Indiana to a Korean father and a Jewish mother. She attended public schools. When she was nine years old, her parents divorced. She and her mother moved to Houston, Texas, where she attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. Choi earned a B.A. in Literature from Yale University (1990) and an M.F.A. from Cornell University.

==Career==

After receiving her graduate degree, she worked for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as a fact checker. At this job she met her husband, Pete Wells; they separated in 2016 but continue to share a house in Brooklyn and co-parent their two sons.

Choi published her first novel, &quot;The Foreign Student&quot; (1998). It won the Asian American Literary Award for Fiction and was a finalist of the Discover Great New Writers Award at Barnes &amp; Noble. Her second novel, &quot;American Woman&quot; (2003), was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in literature. In 2010, she won the PEN/W.G. Sebald Award for &quot;A Person of Interest&quot;, which was also a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 2009. In 2014, her fourth novel, &quot;My Education&quot;, won the Lambda Literary Award for Bisexual Fiction.

With David Remnick, Choi edited an anthology of short fiction entitled &quot;Wonderful Town: New York Stories from The New Yorker&quot;. Her latest novel is &quot;Trust Exercise&quot; (2019), which won the National Book Award for Fiction.

As of May 2018, Choi is working on a novel employing conventions of memoir and reportage that &quot;takes up the question of national identity, and the extent to which it coincides or does not coincide with ethnic and with cultural identity.&quot;

She teaches creative writing at Yale University.

<doc id="1135156" wikidata="Q2273722" url="?curid=1135156" title="Tulsa Roughnecks (1978–1984)">
<text>The Tulsa Roughnecks (1978–1984) were a North American Soccer League (NASL) team from Tulsa, Oklahoma. It played its home games at Skelly Stadium on the campus of the University of Tulsa. The team, previously Team Hawaii, moved to Tulsa after the 1977 season. In 1983, Alex Skotarek became general manager and led one of the lowest-budgeted teams in the NASL to a championship, defeating Toronto, 2–0, at Soccer Bowl &#x27;83.

Shortly after the Tulsa Roughnecks victory of the 1983 Soccer Bowl, President Ronald Reagan sent congratulatory remarks to the team as they carried the trophy in a celebration parade through downtown Tulsa. The Roughnecks still stands (as of 2024) as the only major professional team from Oklahoma to win a championship.

==Highlights==
The Roughnecks first match was a 6–5 indoor loss on February 11, 1978, at the Bayfront Center versus the Tampa Bay Rowdies. Three nights later in their home debut, the same two teams faced off in front of the first 3,250 Roughnecks fans at the Tulsa Assembly Center. A few weeks later they would capture the Skelly Indoor Invitational which they hosted. Over the years Tulsa regularly appeared in the NASL playoffs. They won the NASL title in Soccer Bowl &#x27;83, defeating the Toronto Blizzard at BC Place Stadium (Vancouver) by a score of 2–0 before a paid attendance of 60,051. The team&#x27;s all-time win–loss record was 104–106. The Roughnecks&#x27; home games consistently drew better-than-league-average attendance with the annual record occurring during the 1980 season when the team averaged 19,787 spectators over 16 games for a total attendance that year of 316,593 (placing the Roughnecks at No. 5 between the Seattle Sounders and the Washington Diplomats). The largest home game attendance for Tulsa occurred on April 26, 1980, when 30,822 fans watched the Roughnecks&#x27; 2–1 victory over the New York Cosmos at Skelly Stadium. The highest attendance for any Roughneck game occurred on August 26, 1979, when Tulsa met the Cosmos in New York for a NASL playoff game before a crowd of 76,031.

===Post-NASL===
When, in August 1984, the Major Indoor Soccer League rejected the Roughnecks&#x27; application to join several other NASL teams in participating in the MISL&#x27;s 1984-85 season (citing the town&#x27;s small market status and subpar arena), team owners decided to fold the financially struggling franchise as of the end of the NASL season in September. Former general manager Noel Lemon and a handful of local investors were not ready to give up on soccer in Tulsa, and they were granted permission in January of 1985 to revive the name and put together a team to play outdoors that summer. Before this club could take the field, though, the NASL completed its long, slow collapse and cancelled the upcoming 1985 season in March. Lemon&#x27;s new Roughnecks, which featured several holdover players from the previous iteration of the team, carried on as an independent club and pieced together a 20-game exhibition schedule against teams from the MISL, WACS, Europe and South America, as well as former NASL and USL sides that had not folded. Excluding several cancelations along the way, the team compiled a record of 8–2–1, before suspending operations on July 17, 1985.

Famous Roughnecks players include Iraj Danaeifard, Alex Skotarek, Charlie Mitchell, Billy Caskey, Victor Moreland, Barry Wallace, Alan Woodward, Zeljko Bilecki, Carmelo D&#x27;Anzi, Winston DuBose, Njego Pesa, Laurie Abrahams, Chance Fry, Terry Moore and David McCreery.

<doc id="1135158" wikidata="Q17125574" url="?curid=1135158" title="Debt moratorium">
<text>A debt moratorium is a delay in the payment of debts or obligations. The term is generally used to refer to acts by national governments. Moratory laws are usually passed at times of special political or commercial stress: for instance, on several occasions during the Franco-Prussian War, the French government passed moratory laws. Their international validity was discussed at length, and was upheld in the English law case &quot;Rouquette &quot;v&quot; Overman&quot; (1875) LR 10 QB. Debt moratoriums are generally opposed by creditors.

Proponents of debt moratoriums argue that it is a sovereign decision by the government of a nation to suspend repayment of debt to its creditors, if to do otherwise would do irreparable harm to the welfare of its citizenry. A debt moratorium may take the form of a complete cessation of debt repayments, or a partial cessation: for example, the government of President Alan García of Peru implemented the so-called &quot;Ten Per Cent Solution&quot;, when it was announced that only 10% of export earnings would go to debt payment.

Nations which have, at one time or another, declared a debt moratorium include Peru, Pakistan, Brazil, Ukraine, Mexico, Russia, and Argentina. In 2008, President Correa of Ecuador declared a moratorium on foreign debt repayments, describing the obligations as &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;illegitimate&quot;. Ultimately, the moratorium targeted two bonds in particular, and other obligations were paid.

Several European countries introduced various debt moratoria in connection with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 4 April 2021, Supreme Court of India also asked the PSU banks in India for Interest waiver on loans for the moratorium of loans taken by citizens of India during pandemic lockdown, which is going to cause a loss of 2000 crores to Banks in India.

<doc id="1135161" wikidata="Q1435875" url="?curid=1135161" title="Fontenelle (crater)">
<text>Fontenelle is a lunar impact crater that is located along the northern edge of Mare Frigoris, in the northern part of the Moon. To the northeast is the remnant of the crater Birmingham. Due to its location, this crater appears oval in shape when observed from the Earth because of foreshortening.

The rim of this crater is generally circular, but the edge is irregular and in some locations has a notched appearance. This is particularly true along the southwest and the eastern edges. The rim projects above the surface of the Mare Frigoris, and a wrinkle ridge trends for over 100 km to the southeast from the edge.

The interior of Fontenelle has a fractured floor. There is a low, wide central hill at the midpoint, and some rough ground to the west of this rise.

To the south of Fontenelle on the lunar mare is a small, unnamed crater (about 4.5 km diameter) that is surrounded by a ray system of high albedo material. This crater displays a resemblance to Linné on Mare Serenitatis. This feature lies about 15 kilometers north-northwest of Fontenelle G.

To the east of this crater is an unusual geometric configuration in the surface with an angular shape. This came to be known as &quot;Mädler&#x27;s Square&quot;, after the lunar selenographer Johann Mädler. It is roughly square in shape, but appears lozenge-shaped due to foreshortening. This feature was noted in many early books concerning the Moon.

The crater was named in 1935 by the IAU after French astronomer Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Fontenelle.

<text>A taggant is any chemical or physical marker added to materials to allow various forms of testing or detection. Physical taggants can take many different forms but are typically microscopic in size, included at low levels, and simple to detect. They can be utilized to differentiate authentic product from counterfeits, provide identifying information for traceability purposes (e.g. lot number, company name), determine mixing homogeneity and cross-contamination, and to detect dilution of proprietary products. Taggants are known to be widely used in the animal feed industry, plastics, inks, sheet and flexible explosives, and pharmaceuticals.

An RF taggant is a radio frequency microchip used in automated identification and data capture (see RFID). In such cases, electronic devices use radio waves to track and identify items, such as pharmaceutical products, by assigning individual serial numbers to the containers holding each product. This technology may prevent the diversion or counterfeiting of drugs by allowing wholesalers and pharmacists to determine the identity and dosage of individual products.

A software taggant is a cryptographic signature added to software that enables positive origin identification and integrity of programs. Software taggants use standard PKI techniques (see public key infrastructure) and were introduced by the Industry Connections Security Group of IEEE in an attempt to control proliferation of malware obfuscation via executable compression.

==History of taggants==
The word &#x27;taggant&#x27; originates from the trademarked name &quot;Microtaggant Identification Particles&quot;. Microtaggants were originally developed by 3M for the post-detonation identification of explosives. In 1985, Microtrace, LLC acquired the technology and began to utilize Microtaggants for anti-counterfeiting and brand protection. Since 1985, the word &#x27;taggant&#x27; has become widely utilized and refers to multiple variations.

==Explosive taggants==

There are two types of taggant which have been considered for use with explosives. One is to help detect the presence of a bomb in, for example, airport screening of luggage; and the other to assist the police in identifying the explosive after the detonation of such a bomb.

===Detection taggants===

These are volatile chemicals which will slowly evaporate from the explosive and can be detected in the atmosphere by either detection dogs or specialised machines. They are intended to enhance the detectability of the explosive by instruments or animals thus revealing the presence of a bomb containing the explosive to be detected. Although various technologies exist to detect untagged explosives, detection taggants help to increase their reliability. The inclusion of detection taggants in explosives is mandatory in some countries. Following the bombing of PanAm 103 over Scotland, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was instrumental in effecting a worldwide requirement for placing a detection taggant in plastic bonded explosives.

There is a choice between four possible detection taggant chemicals which must be added to plastic explosives under the 1991 International Civil Aviation Organization&#x27;s Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection. In the United States the marker is always 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane, usually called DMDNB or DMNB. Dogs are very sensitive to it and can detect as little as 0.5 parts per billion in the air, as can specialised ion mobility spectrometers. Other taggants in use are ethylene glycol dinitrate, known as EGDN and used to mark Semtex, ortho-mononitrotoluene (o-MNT), and para-mononitrotoluene (p-MNT).

===Identification (or post detonation) taggants===

These have been considered for introduction in industrial explosives so that the manufacturer and batch number can be determined if they are used illegally. The taggant must survive the detonation of the product and not be contaminated by the environment afterwards. Several different technologies have been considered, but the most common are microscopic polymer/metallic particles. Taggant evidence was crucial in the 1980 conviction of James L. McFillin in Maryland for the 1979 truck bombing murder of Nathan A. Allen, Sr.

A contention claimed for opposing mandated taggants is that most terrorist attacks use homemade explosives (HME) which would allegedly not be tagged. Examples given included, for instance, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the Oklahoma City and the Omagh bombings. Contamination of the site is also cited as a problem, since different taggants might be present at a crime scene from, for example, explosives used to obtain the building materials.

Switzerland passed a law in 1980 requiring taggants in explosives manufactured there, and that the code must be changed every six months. So far it is the only country which requires identification taggants. Imported explosives must be tagged only if competing products are also manufactured in Switzerland.

In the United States, the NRA opposed the mandated use of taggants in firearm propellants after tests revealed a dangerous increase in burn rates. It was claimed that a chemical incompatibility with the propellent powders would cause such an increase in pressures that many firearms would burst after using a taggant-laced powder that had been stored for as little as several months. However, these tests were performed on gunpowder with a taggant concentration of 500,000 parts per million (in other words, one-half), which is 2,000 times greater than the official recommended taggant concentration of 250 parts per million.

==Taggants for brand protection==
When used as a chemical marker, taggants can be used for authentication of products and documents.
Taggants are sometimes used by brand owners and governments to authenticate commonly counterfeited items. Taggants are integrated into the material of the item itself or into the packaging. Once integrated, the taggants can only be verified with specially engineered readers.

===Common taggant anticounterfeiting features===
* Taggants are uniquely encoded materials or chemistries that act as virtual &quot;fingerprints&quot;
* Taggants can be invisible to the naked eye or visible (covert or overt)
* Taggants can be detectable with specially-engineered equipment or detected with low cost detectors for field testing
* Taggant technology should be extremely difficult to reverse engineer 
* Once integrated into an item, taggants should mark the item permanently and should not be removable

===Common taggant anticounterfeiting applications===
* Tax Stamp authentication
* Banknote authentication
* Cigarette anticounterfeiting
* Alcohol anticounterfeiting
* Pharmaceutical anticounterfeiting
* Fast-moving consumer goods anticounterfeiting
* Building materials
* Consumer products

<text>Daniel Hiester (June 25, 1747 – March 7, 1804) was an American political and military leader from the Revolutionary War period to the early 19th Century. Born in Berks County in the Province of Pennsylvania, he was a member of the Hiester Family political dynasty. He was the brother of John Hiester and Gabriel Hiester, cousin of Joseph Hiester, and the uncle of William Hiester and U.S. Rep. Daniel Hiester (1774–1834).

==Biography==
Hiester&#x27;s father, also named Daniel Hiester, emigrated from Silesia in 1737 and settled in Goshenhoppen (now Bally), Pennsylvania, afterward purchasing a tract of several thousand acres in Berks County. After completing his education, the young Hiester engaged in the mercantile business in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He owned slaves as well.

During the American Revolution, Hiester served as a colonel and later a brigadier general of the Pennsylvania Militia. He was a member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from 1778 to 1781. In 1784 he was elected to the supreme executive council of Pennsylvania, and later in 1787 he was appointed as a commissioner to negotiate the Connecticut land claims dispute.

Hiester was elected to the United States House of Representatives representing Pennsylvania, serving from March 4, 1789, until his resignation on July 1, 1796. He then moved to Hagerstown, Maryland, and was again elected to the House representing Maryland, serving from March 4, 1801, until his death in Washington, D.C., on March 7, 1804. He was among the number that voted to move the U.S. capital from Philadelphia to a place on the Potomac later named Washington, D.C.

He was buried in Zion Reformed Graveyard in Hagerstown, Maryland and has a cenotaph at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington.

<doc id="1135176" wikidata="Q2972178" url="?curid=1135176" title="Revolutionary Communist League, National Committee">
<text>is a Japanese far-left revolutionary group, often referred to as Chūkaku-ha (, &quot;Central Core Faction&quot;) in Japanese. Their main goal is to have Japan, and the entire world, adopt communist policies. Chūkaku-ha rejects imperialism and Stalinism.

The group is led by , who became the chairman in 1997.

The Japanese National Police Agency reports that as of 2020, 4,700 members are active in Chukaku-ha.

== History ==

===Prehistory of Chūkaku-ha===
In 1957 a number of dissidents dissatisfied with the direction of the Japan Communist Party (JCP), along with a number of student activists from the Nationwide Zengakuren student federation, formed the Revolutionary Communist League (RCL), usually abbreviated as Kakukyōdō in Japanese. This group was fervently anti-Stalinist, and soon fell under the sway of the charismatic half-blind Trotskyist philosopher Kan&#x27;ichi Kuroda. The RCL believed the Stalinist form of communism, which they saw as predominant in Eastern Europe, China, the USSR, and North Korea, did not elevate the working class as true as Marxist communism intended. Their goals at this time were to overthrow the Japanese government, end U.S. occupation of Okinawa, and abolish the U.S.-Japan Alliance.

The group evolved into its current form (Chūkaku-ha) after a series of schisms. In 1959, Kuroda Kan&#x27;ichi was expelled from the RCL in the wake of a scandal in which he tried to sell compromising information about the JCP to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Therefore, Kuroda, along with his right-hand man Nobuyoshi Honda, founded their own version of the RCL, with the appellation &quot;National Committee&quot; added to the name, and took many of their followers with them to create the RCL-NC. In 1960, a youth branch of the RCL-NC was established for Zengakuren student activists as the Marxist Student League (MSL), abbreviated Marugakudō in Japanese. This was followed in 1961 by the creation of another youth branch for young labor unionists, the Marxist Workers&#x27; Youth League (MWYL).

Finally in 1963, the parent organization RCL-NC split in two as the result of a disagreement between Kuroda and Honda over whether to pursue socialist revolution in alliance with others, or to focus on strengthening and expanding a single revolutionary organization, with the resultant split of Marugakudō into the &quot;Central Core Faction&quot; (&quot;Chūkaku-ha&quot;), which was led by Honda and favored allying with others, and the &quot;Revolutionary Marxist Faction&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Kakumaru-ha&quot;) Zengakuren, which staunchly adhered to Kuroda’s insistence on going it alone.

===Chūkaku-ha era===

Starting in the mid-1960s, Chūkaku-ha, became active in organizing protest activities. In 1966, Chūkaku-ha joined in alliance with two other radical student groups, the &quot;Second Bund&quot; (&quot;Daini Bunto&quot;) and the Liberation Faction of the Socialist Youth League (&quot;Kaihō-ha&quot;) to form the &quot;Three-Faction&quot; (&quot;Sanpa&quot;) Zengakuren. As part of the Sanpa Zengakuren, Chūkaku-ha participated in the October 8, 1967 protest at Haneda Airport which attempted to block Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Satō from visiting South Vietnam. In 1968, they protested the visit of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, , to Sasebo. Later that same year Chūkaku-ha participated in another protest of the Shinjuku Rail Station&#x27;s transportation of US forces fuel tanks, remembered as the &quot;Shinjuku Riot.&quot;

Beginning in 1968, Chūkaku-ha became involved in the Sanrizuka Struggle assisting farmers in violently opposing the construction of Narita Airport outside of Tokyo. Some members of Chūkaku-ha remained deeply involved in this struggle well into the 1980s.

In 1968 and 1969, the organization promoted several protests at campuses across Japan. Throughout this period and into the 1970s, Chūkaku-ha was engaged in violent conflict with their archrivals in Kakumaru-ha. During the conflict, Kakumaru-ha assassinated several members of Chūkaku-ha, including its leader Nobuyoshi Honda in 1975. According to Chūkaku-ha, Kakumaru-ha was aided and protected by the police.

Starting in the late 1970s, the group began committing armed assaults, bombings, and destruction of infrastructure in Japan. There were a fair number of casualties and injuries as a result of the dozens of attacks they conducted. Casualties included the chairperson of Chiba prefecture&#x27;s Expropriation Committee, whose death delayed the area&#x27;s development.

In 1986, their covert weapons factory was raided by police after two suspects were arrested for carrying an explosive in their truck. Chūkaku-ha&#x27;s attacks continued into the later part of the 20th century, with the last one occurring in 2001.
In 2017, the MPD announced the arrest of Masaaki Osaka, a known Chūkaku-ha leader accused of killing a police officer during a riot on November 14, 1971. On that day, a protest against the occupation of Okinawa by the United States turned violent, with students throwing Molotov cocktails at officers.

Today, Chūkaku-ha still stages protests and operates a YouTube channel to document and publicize its activities. Takeo Shimizu, one of Chukaku-ha&#x27;s surviving leaders, appeared in public after going underground since 1971 on September 6, 2020 at Arakawa, Tokyo. During a news conference on January 27, 2021, he criticized Tokyo for its COVID-19 response and asserted that the crisis was an opportunity for a revolution.

As of 2021, the organization has experienced a resurgence in interest among some young Japanese dissatisfied with the trajectory of the Japanese Communist Party. In May 2023, Chūkaku-ha organized an anti-G7 protest in Hiroshima, denouncing the G7 summit as &quot;imperialism for nuclear war&quot;.

<doc id="1135180" wikidata="Q2827921" url="?curid=1135180" title="Aiki-ken">
<text>Aiki-ken (Kanji: 合気剣 Hiragana: あいきけん) is the name given specifically to the set of Japanese sword techniques practiced according to the principles of aikido, taught first by Morihei Ueshiba (aikido&#x27;s founder), then further developed by Morihiro Saito, one of Ueshiba&#x27;s most prominent students. Currently, Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-kai is the main proponent organization.

==Development==

Much of the aiki-ken syllabus was developed by Morihei Ueshiba (植芝 盛平 &quot;Ueshiba Morihei&quot;, 1883–1969) at his dojo in Iwama, Japan, at the same time he developed aikido&#x27;s staff training (called &quot;aiki-jō&quot;). It is well documented that Ueshiba studied several different styles of &quot;kenjutsu&quot; (Japanese swordsmanship), but the aiki-ken techniques are predominantly based upon the teachings of the Kashima Shintō-ryu.

The practice of aiki-ken is not pervasive. Some schools of aikido incorporate weapons training that is unrelated to aiki-ken, and others forego weapons training entirely.

==Practice==

Much of aiki-ken bears little similarity to other modern sword arts. Rather than learning to &quot;fight&quot; with swords, the primary purpose of aiki-ken is to magnify errors in one&#x27;s aikido technique, and to give the student an opportunity to apply the principles of aikido in different situations. Aiki-ken is practiced using &quot;bokken&quot; (a wooden katana) and has a wide variety of techniques. Saito codified two sets of techniques, the first being seven &quot;suburi&quot; (solo cutting exercises), and the second being five partnered forms. Some dojo also practice &quot;jiyu-waza&quot; armed with &quot;bokken&quot; (freestyle technique, without a predetermined form of attack and response).

===Suburi===

, meaning &quot;practice-swinging&quot;, is used to refer to the basic solo movements of aiki-ken, developed as a distillation of the partnered practice.

There are seven aiki-ken &quot;suburi&quot; in Saito&#x27;s tradition, and are very simply named as follows:
#&quot;Ichi-no&quot;: A simple downward vertical cut.
#&quot;Ni-no&quot;: Step back into &quot;jōdan-no-kamae&quot;, then a downward vertical cut.
#&quot;San-no&quot;: Step back into &quot;waki-gamae&quot;, then a downward vertical cut.
#&quot;Yon-no&quot;: Step forward with a downward vertical cut; repeat.
#&quot;Go-no&quot;: Step forward while guarding, then a 70-degree downward cut; repeat.
#&quot;Roku-no&quot;: Step forward with a downward vertical cut, then shuffle forward and thrust.
#&quot;Shichi-no&quot;: Step forward while guarding, then a 70-degree downward cut, then step forward and thrust.

===Kumitachi===

The partnered forms practice of aiki-ken is called , meaning sword practice with a partner. There are five &quot;kumitachi&quot; in Saito&#x27;s aiki-ken curriculum. The &quot;kumitachi&quot; teach students how to alternately control the center line and move off it to avoid attacks and how to blend with an opponent&#x27;s attacks, among other skills.

#Ichi-no-tachi (一の太刀): first of sword
#Ni-no-tachi (二の太刀): second of sword
#San-no-tachi (三の太刀): third of sword
#Yon-no-tachi (四の太刀): fourth of sword
#Go-no-tachi (五の太刀): fifth of sword
#Kimusubi-no-tachi (気結びの太刀): blending one&#x27;s energy with partner of sword

Improvisational variations on the &quot;kumitachi&quot; (called &quot;henka&quot;), which generally cause the &quot;kumitachi&quot; form to end early with one person taking advantage of an opening to strike or throw the other, are also taught.

<doc id="1135183" wikidata="Q233104" url="?curid=1135183" title="Bicorne">
<text>The bicorne or bicorn (two-cornered) is a historical form of hat widely adopted in the 1790s as an item of uniform by European and American army and naval officers. Most generals and staff officers of the Napoleonic period wore bicornes, which survived as widely-worn full-dress headdress until the 20th century.

==Historic use==
Descended from the tricorne, the black-coloured bicorne originally had a rather broad brim, with the front and the rear halves turned up and pinned together forming a semi-circular fan shape; there was usually a cockade in the national colours at the front. Later, the hat became more triangular in shape, with its two ends becoming more pointed, and it was worn with the cockade at the right side. That kind of bicorne eventually became known in English as the &quot;cocked hat&quot;, but it is still known in French as the &quot;bicorne&quot;.

Worn in the side-to-side athwart style during the 1790s, the bicorne became normally seen fore-and-aft in most armies and navies from 1800. The change in style coincided with the flattening out of the pronounced front peak of the original headdress. The French gendarmerie continued to wear their bicornes in the classic side-to-side fashion until about 1904, and the Italian Carabinieri still do so in their modern full dress.

Some forms of bicorne were designed to be folded flat so that they could be conveniently tucked under the arm when they were not being worn. A bicorne of such a style is also known as a &quot;chapeau-bras&quot; or &quot;chapeau-de-bras&quot;.

The bicorne was widely worn until World War I as part of the full dress of officers of most of the world&#x27;s navies. It survived to a more limited extent between the wars for wear by senior officers in the British, French, US, Japanese and other navies until World War II but has now almost disappeared in that context.

It was also worn during the 19th and the early 20th centuries by civilian officials in European monarchies and Japan when required to wear uniforms on formal occasions. The practice generally ceased after World War I except in the context of diplomatic uniform. British colonial governors in temperate climates and governors general in some countries of the Commonwealth (notably Australia, Canada and New Zealand) continued to wear bicornes with ceremonial dress until the second half of the 20th century.

== Cocked hat ==

By the 20th century, the term &quot;cocked hat&quot; had come to be used more often than not in official British usage (uniform regulations etc.) with reference to that shape of hat (particularly when worn as part of a uniform), but in the rare instances that hats were directed to be worn side-to-side (&#x27;athwarts&#x27;) rather than front-to-back, such as by footmen in full state livery, the term &quot;bicorn&quot; tended to be preferred.

In its most commonly-seen form at the time, the cocked hat was pinned up at two sides to form a hump-back bridge shape and was worn perpendicular to the shoulders, with the front end above the face and the back end over the nape. A cockade in the national colours might be worn at the right side (French tradition), and a plume might be attached to the top (British military c. 1800). Cocked hats were often trimmed with gold or silver bullion lace and tassels. Naval officers wore them without further decorations, but those worn by military and civilian officials might be lavishly decorated with coloured ostrich or swan feathers.

The cocked hat still remains the &quot;Full Dress headdress of General and Staff Officers and certain others&quot; and is worn in public by certain office-holders such as the Major-General commanding the Household Division, Gold Stick and Silver Stick and the Constable of the Tower.

== Current use ==


Members of the Académie française wear the &quot;habit vert&quot; (green habit) at the Académie&#x27;s ceremonies. The habit includes a black jacket and a &quot;bicorne&quot; in the cocked-hat style, each embroidered in green.

Students at the École Polytechnique wear a bicorne as part of their &quot;Grand Uniforme&quot; (GU). Female students used to wear a tricorne hat but now also wear a bicorne. The bicorne also formed part of the historic black and red full dress of cadets at the French Military Medical School (&quot;École de Santé des Armées&quot;) until this uniform was withdrawn in 1971, except for limited use on special occasions. The bicorne is still worn by the members of the Cadre Noir in full dress uniform.

The uniform of the horsemen of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna includes a bicorne.

Diplomatic uniforms, worn on such occasions as the presentation of credentials by ambassadors, normally included bicornes worn with feathers and gold or silver braiding. Until World War II such uniforms were worn by even junior embassy staff but now survive only for ambassadors in a few long-established diplomatic services such as those of Britain, France, Sweden, Belgium and Spain.

In the United Kingdom cocked hats continue to be worn by certain office-holders on special occasions:
*On occasions in Parliament when the King is represented by Lords Commissioners (e.g. at Prorogation) the Lords Commissioners wear plain black bicorne hats with their parliamentary robes (except the Lord Chancellor who, if present, wears his tricorne).
*At the annual Trooping the Colour in London, the Major-General commanding the Household Division wears full dress uniform (as does his chief of staff) consisting of a scarlet tunic and a cocked hat with swan-feather plume. Similar hats with distinctive upright plumes are worn by the Equerries on this and other State occasions.
*Senior officers holding certain royal or special appointments also wear cocked hats (e.g. officers of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, officers of the Yeomen of the Guard, etc.).
*In most British regiments prior to 1914, certain Regimental Staff officers in full-dress uniform wore cocked hats in place of the usual regimental headdress. Since then, the use of full dress has been largely restricted to the Household Division, which maintains the tradition: quartermasters wear cocked hats with a feather of regimental colour, whilst Veterinary Officers and Medical Officers wear cocked hats with a red feather plume and black feather plume respectively.
*Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police Service and City of London Police in full dress uniform.
*Governors of United Kingdom overseas territories may wear a cocked hat with white swan-feather plume, or in tropical territories, a plumed pith helmet. Usage has declined since a 2001 decision by HM Treasury that the overseas territorial government concerned would be responsible for meeting the cost of their governor&#x27;s optional ceremonial uniforms.
*A cocked hat is still sometimes seen as part of Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom.

In the Knights of Columbus, Fourth Degree Knights of the Color Corps wore regalia which included a chivalric chapeau. The color of the plume denoted the office held by the wearer. A new uniform with a beret replacing the cocked hat was announced in 2017 and the old uniform gradually phased out over the following several years.

The Italian Carabinieri wear a bicorn with points sideways with their full dress uniform. The large tricolor cockade in front has given it the popular name of la &quot;lucerna&quot;, the &quot;lamp&quot;.

In Java, cocked hat is still used as a part of Dhaeng and Ketanggung brigades&#x27; parade uniform from the Yogyakarta Sultanate. Since the end of the Java War, and as a result of some drastic reductions in the period before and after the war, they no longer have combat capability as a fighting troops in general. Known in Javanese as &#x27; hat, because of its shape like a pointed nose, &#x27;, the &quot;mancungan&quot; only appears on special occasions, such as Grebeg and other cultural or ceremonial events held by the kraton (palace). The headgear came as a part of Western influence in Yogyakarta during the reign of Sultan Hamengkubuwana IV.

The uniform of a Field marshal of the Imperial Ethiopian Army, which was used during the early 20th century by Emperor Haile Selassie, had a Bicorne which was specially adorned with a golden lion&#x27;s mane.

<text>:&quot;see also Otto Lang (film producer) and Otto Lang (actor)&quot;
Otto Emil Lang (born 14 May 1932) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician.

==Life and career==
Lang was born in Handel, Saskatchewan. In 1961, he was appointed Dean of Law at the University of Saskatchewan, the youngest person to be appointed to that position, and served until 1969.

Lang was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1968 election, and was re-elected in the 1972 and 1974 elections as the Member of Parliament for Saskatoon—Humboldt. He served as Minister without Portfolio (1968–70), Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board (1969–79), Acting Minister of Mines, Energy and Resources (1969), Minister of Manpower and Immigration (1970–72), Minister of Justice and Attorney General (1972–75), Minister of Transport (1975–79), Acting Minister of Communications (1975), Acting Minister of Justice and Attorney General (1978), and Minister of Justice and Attorney General (1978). His riding was abolished ahead of the 1979 federal election, and when he ran in the successor constituency of Saskatoon East, he lost to Robert Ogle of the New Democratic Party.

Following his career in politics, Lang served as the Executive Vice-president of Pioneer Grain Co. Ltd., Chairman of the Transport Institute at the University of Manitoba and as president, CEO of Centra Gas Manitoba Inc. He is currently retired, but serves as a director of several companies, including Investor&#x27;s Group and the Winnipeg Airport Authority. In 2005-06 Lang served as the co-chair of the federal Liberal election campaign for Manitoba. He also took part in international activities as the Honorary Consul-General of Japan.

A Rhodes Scholar, Lang holds a B.A. and an LL.B. from the University of Saskatchewan, a B.C.L from Oxford University (Exeter College) and an LL.D. from the University of Manitoba. He played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club, winning two Blues.

In 1999, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

==Family==
Lang is married to Madam Justice Deborah McCawley of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba. They currently reside in Manitoba. He was previously married to Adrian Merchant, the daughter of Sally Merchant.

<text>Heymans is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northern part of the Moon on the far side from the Earth. It lies between the craters Poinsot to the north and Hippocrates slightly farther to the south. To the southeast of Heymans is the larger Mezentsev.

This crater has been worn by subsequent impacts, but retains the general appearance of its original form. At the north end a small crater overlies the rim, and there are smaller impacts across the rim to the east and south. But the rim is generally round and symmetrical, with a slightly narrower inner wall to the northeast. Within the rim, the interior floor is level and nearly featureless.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Heymans.

<text>Anna Maria College is a private Catholic college in Paxton, Massachusetts, United States. It was founded in 1946 as a women&#x27;s college, but has been coeducational since 1973. The school offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.

==History==
Anna Maria College was founded in 1946 as a women&#x27;s college by the Sisters of Saint Anne, after receiving formal approval from Richard Cushing, the Archbishop of Boston. The original campus was in Marlborough, Massachusetts. In 1951, the college moved to its present location in Paxton. Four years later, accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges was issued.

In 1973, Anna Maria College became coeducational, and a year later, began graduate degree programs. On April 3, 1980, the Sisters of Saint Anne ceased involvement in running the school, and a Board of Trustees was established.

In 2004, the college established the Molly Bish Center for the Protection of Children and the Elderly.

==Academics==
Anna Maria College has an average annual enrollment of around 1,500 students, which consist of mostly undergraduate and graduate students, as well as some continuing education learners. Rooted in the traditions of Catholic education, the college combines liberal arts and sciences education with career preparation.

The college is divided among six academic schools: the School of Business; the School of Education; the School of Justice and Social Sciences; the School of Fire and Health Sciences; the School of Visual and Performing Arts; and the School of Humanities.

==Athletics==
Anna Maria College has thirteen Division III athletic teams, known as the AMCATS (Anna Maria College Athletic Team Sports), in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), including men&#x27;s baseball, basketball, cross country, football, ice hockey, lacrosse, and soccer; and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, field hockey, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball. The school is a member of the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC). Football is played in the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference (ECFC). Anna Maria was also a charter member of the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC), which it competed in from 1984 to 2011 before joining the GNAC.

<text>Peter Thomas Scolari (September 12, 1955 – October 22, 2021) was an American actor. He was best known for his roles as Henry Desmond in the ABC sitcom &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (1980–1982) and Michael Harris on the CBS sitcom &quot;Newhart&quot; (1984–1990), the latter of which earned him three consecutive nominations for Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series from 1987 to 1989.

Scolari had roles as Wayne Szalinski in the Disney sitcom &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show&quot; (1997–2000) and as Tad Horvath in the HBO series &quot;Girls&quot; (2012–2017), the latter of which earned him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. He had recurring roles as Gillian B. Loeb in the superhero crime series &quot;Gotham&quot; (2015) and Bishop Thomas Marx in the supernatural series &quot;Evil&quot; (2019–2021).

He acted in the films &quot;The Rosebud Beach Hotel&quot; (1984), &quot;Corporate Affairs&quot; (1990), &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (2004). On stage, he portrayed Yogi Berra in the play &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot; (2014) and acted in the Larry Gelbart&#x27;s &quot;Sly Fox&quot; (2004), Eric Simonson&#x27;s &quot;Magic/Bird&quot; (2012), and Nora Ephron&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Guy&quot; (2013). He also acted in replacement roles in the musicals &quot;Hairspray&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Wicked&quot; in 2016.

== Early life and education ==
Scolari was born in New Rochelle, New York, to Arthur and Barbara (née Fay) Scolari, and was raised in Scarsdale along with an older sister and two younger brothers. His father was of Italian descent and played semi-professional baseball before becoming a lawyer. His mother was a singer prior to meeting Scolari&#x27;s father and later worked with the Alcohol Rehabilitation arm of the Tidewater Psychiatric Institute in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In an interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; Scolari said that his father was a psychologically abusive, &quot;rageful man&quot;, and that his mother struggled with alcoholism. Scolari added that his parents &quot;stayed together for the kids and also because they were hopelessly in love with each other, but they were totally incompatible.&quot;

At the age of 13 Scolari did some animation voice acting work and performed in plays while attending Edgemont High School in Scarsdale, where he also participated in football, baseball and track. At 16 years of age he starred as Finch in a high school production of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; and came to the realization that he wanted to be an actor professionally.

In 1972, he enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles as a theater arts major, but left a year later and returned to New York after his father died. He joined the Colonnades Theatre Lab, a repertory theatre in Manhattan, working with actors such as Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Jeff Goldblum and Michael O&#x27;Keefe. Scolari was also working on a degree in comparative literature at City College of New York. During this time, Scolari appeared in multiple off-Broadway plays and met Finnish actor Paavo Tammim, who taught him to juggle. He also studied mime and learned to ride a unicycle. His performance in a 1974 production of &quot;Reflections&quot; received a rave review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 1979 he returned to Los Angeles.

==Career==
=== 1978–1990: &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; and &quot;Newhart&quot; ===
Credited under pseudonym Barney Tramble, Scolari&#x27;s first film role was in the 1978 X rated film &quot;Take Off&quot;. He played a teenager named Kookie and his performance did not involve nudity. Scolari was signed to do an NBC pilot in 1979 titled &quot;The Further Adventures Of Wally Brown&quot;, a show that did not get picked up. He starred in the short-lived 1980 sitcom &quot;Goodtime Girls&quot; as Benny, the juggling neighbor of the title characters. His big break came when he was cast with Tom Hanks in the 1980 sitcom, &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;. Scolari and Hanks play a couple of advertising copywriters who disguise themselves as women in order to live in an affordable New York apartment — a women&#x27;s-only residence called the Susan B. Anthony Hotel. A different actor had initially been cast alongside Hanks, but things didn&#x27;t work out. Scolari happened to be playing a guest role on an adjacent sound stage and was auditioned for the role. The show&#x27;s pilot was shot a few days later. Scolari played Henry Desmond, whose female pseudonym was Hildegard, and Hanks played Kip Wilson, who went by the name Buffy. &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; started out with good ratings, but failed to hold the public&#x27;s interest and was canceled after two seasons and 37 episodes. His next starring role was in the 1983 sitcom &quot;Baby Makes Five&quot;, which was cancelled after only five episodes.

He starred in the 1984 comedy film &quot;The Rosebud Beach Hotel&quot;, about a couple — played by Scolari and Colleen Camp — who turn their hotel into a brothel, by hiring sex workers to work as bellhops. That same year Scolari joined the cast of &quot;Newhart&quot; as Michael Harris, a preppily-dressed, wannabe yuppie, and local TV producer of the fictional talk show &quot;Vermont Today&quot;. Harris was a recurring character in the show&#x27;s second season and the character was so popular with audiences that executive producer Barry Kemp signed Scolari to be a regular cast member in the show&#x27;s following season, before it was even confirmed that there would be a third season. His role earned Scolari three Emmy nominations for best supporting actor in a comedy and remained with the show until its conclusion in 1990. During this time, Scolari also got to showcase his vaudevillian talents during three episodes of the annual television special, &quot;Circus of the Stars&quot;, including juggling with knives and fire, as well as juggling on a tightrope. Scolari once again worked with Hanks on his directorial debut, &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; about a fictional 1960s rock band called the Wonders. Scolari plays the role of Troy Chesterfield, the host of a variety show on which the Wonders appear.

=== 1991–2011: Established roles ===
In 1993, Scolari starred in the series &quot;Family Album&quot; about a couple who move with their children back to their hometown of Philadelphia to be closer to their aging parents. Actress Gina Hecht was initially selected to play the wife of Scolari&#x27;s character, but was replaced by Pamela Reed just two days before the show&#x27;s pilot was shot. Scolari told the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; in 1993 that he and Reed had &quot;instant rapport&quot;, however the show lasted one season. Two years later he starred in the series &quot;Dweebs&quot;, which centers around the employees of a software firm. Scolari plays Warren Mosbey, the company&#x27;s eccentric, socially-inept, tech-genius owner. The show was cancelled after one season. In 1996, Scolari also starred as Littlechap in a version of the stage musical &quot;Stop the World – I Want to Get Off&quot;, produced for the A&amp;E television network.

Scolari appeared in such off-Broadway productions as &quot;Old Man Joseph and His Family&quot;, &quot;The Exonerated&quot;, &quot;In the Wings&quot;, &quot;It Must Be Him&quot; and &quot;White&#x27;s Lies&quot;. Scolari starred in &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show&quot; over the show&#x27;s three seasons. Scolari plays inventor Wayne Szalinski, the role originally played by Rick Moranis in the &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; series of films. During the show&#x27;s run, he also played astronaut Pete Conrad in the 1998 miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, co-produced by Hanks, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. Scolari appeared on Broadway in the musical &quot;Hairspray&quot;, as Wilbur Turnblad. Scolari and Hanks also provided voices in the 2004 animated film &quot;The Polar Express&quot;.

=== 2012–2021: Resurgence with &quot;Girls&quot; ===
In 2012 he acted playing various roles including Pat Riley, Red Auerbach, Jerry Buss, Bob Woolf in the play &quot;Magic/Bird&quot; on Broadway. He later had a recurring role as Tad Horvath, the father of Lena Dunham&#x27;s character on the HBO coming-of-age comedy-drama &quot;Girls&quot; from 2012 to 2017. He won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 2016. In 2013, he returned to Broadway in the Nora Ephron&#x27;s newspaper play &quot;Lucky Guy&quot;, which reunited him with his &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; co-star Tom Hanks. He played Gotham City&#x27;s corrupt police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb in Fox&#x27;s superhero crime drama &quot;Gotham&quot; from 2014 to 2019. In 2014, he portrayed Yogi Berra in the Eric Simonson sports play &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot; on Broadway. His wife, Tracy Shayne, played Berra&#x27;s wife Carmen.
Scolari returned to Broadway in the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, as a replacement playing the Wizard of Oz from 2016 to 2017. He played the role of a show business manager in the 2019 biographical FX miniseries &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot;, and played Bishop Marx on the series &quot;Evil&quot;, from 2019 until his death.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and family ===
Scolari was married four times. His first marriage was to Brooklyn attorney Lisa Kretzchmar. They divorced in 1983. He married Debra Steagal, a costume designer he met while filming &quot;The Rosebud Beach Hotel&quot; in 1986, and they had two children. He later wed actress Cathy Trien, with whom he also had two children. In 2013 he married his longtime girlfriend, actress Tracy Shayne. The couple remained together until Scolari&#x27;s death.

=== Illness and death ===
Scolari&#x27;s struggles with substance abuse and bipolar disorder were featured on a 2014 episode of &quot;&quot;. Scolari died from leukemia in Manhattan on October 22, 2021, at age 66. He had been diagnosed with the disease two years earlier.

<doc id="1135199" wikidata="Q5849717" url="?curid=1135199" title="Stroboscopic effect">
<text>The stroboscopic effect is a visual phenomenon caused by aliasing that occurs when continuous rotational or other cyclic motion is represented by a series of short or instantaneous samples (as opposed to a continuous view) at a sampling rate close to the period of the motion. It accounts for the &quot;wagon-wheel effect&quot;, so-called because in video, spoked wheels (such as on horse-drawn wagons) sometimes appear to be turning backwards.

A strobe fountain, a stream of water droplets falling at regular intervals lit with a strobe light, is an example of the stroboscopic effect being applied to a cyclic motion that is not rotational. When viewed under normal light, this is a normal water fountain. When viewed under a strobe light with its frequency tuned to the rate at which the droplets fall, the droplets appear to be suspended in mid-air. Adjusting the strobe frequency can make the droplets seemingly move slowly up or down.

Depending upon the frequency of illumination there are different names for the visual effect. Up to about 80 Hertz or the flicker fusion threshold it is called visible flicker. From about 80 Hertz to 2000 Hertz it is called the stroboscopic effect (this article). Overlapping in frequency, but from 80 Hertz up to about 6500 Hertz a third effect exists called the phantom array effect or the ghosting effect, an optical phenomenon caused by rapid eye movements (saccades) of the observer. 

Simon Stampfer, who coined the term in his 1833 patent application for his &quot;stroboscopische Scheiben&quot; (better known as the &quot;phenakistiscope&quot;), explained how the illusion of motion occurs when during unnoticed regular and very short interruptions of light, one figure gets replaced by a similar figure in a slightly different position. Any series of figures can thus be manipulated to show movements in any desired direction.

==Explanation==
Consider the stroboscope as used in mechanical analysis. This may be a &quot;strobe light&quot; that is fired at an adjustable rate. For example, an object is rotating at 60 revolutions per second: if it is viewed with a series of short flashes at 60 times per second, each flash illuminates the object at the same position in its rotational cycle, so it appears that the object is stationary. Furthermore, at a frequency of 60 flashes per second, persistence of vision smooths out the sequence of flashes so that the perceived image is continuous.

If the same rotating object is viewed at 61 flashes per second, each flash will illuminate it at a slightly earlier part of its rotational cycle. Sixty-one flashes will occur before the object is seen in the same position again, and the series of images will be perceived as if it is rotating backwards once per second.

The same effect occurs if the object is viewed at 59 flashes per second, except that each flash illuminates it a little later in its rotational cycle and so, the object will seem to be rotating forwards.

The same could be applied at other frequencies like the 50 Hz characteristic of electric distribution grids of most of countries in the world.

In the case of motion pictures, action is captured as a rapid series of still images and the same stroboscopic effect can occur.

===Audio conversion from light patterns===
The stroboscopic effect also plays a role in audio playback. Compact discs rely on strobing reflections of the laser from the surface of the disc in order to be processed (it is also used for computer data). DVDs and Blu-ray Discs have similar functions.

The stroboscopic effect also plays a role for laser microphones.

==Wagon-wheel effect==
Motion-picture cameras conventionally film at 24 frames per second. Although the wheels of a vehicle are not likely to be turning at 24 revolutions per second (as that would be extremely fast), suppose each wheel has 12 spokes and rotates at only two revolutions per second. Filmed at 24 frames per second, the spokes in each frame will appear in exactly the same position. Hence, the wheel will be perceived to be stationary. In fact, each photographically captured spoke in any one position will be a different actual spoke in each successive frame, but since the spokes are close to identical in shape and color, no difference will be perceived. Thus, as long as the number of times the wheel rotates per second is a factor of 24 and 12, the wheel will appear to be stationary.

If the wheel rotates a little more slowly than two revolutions per second, the position of the spokes is seen to fall a little further behind in each successive frame and therefore, the wheel will seem to be turning backwards.

== Beneficial effects ==
Stroboscopic principles, and their ability to create an illusion of motion, underlie the theory behind animation, film, and other moving pictures.

In some special applications, stroboscopic pulsations have benefits. For instance, a stroboscope is tool that produces short repetitive flashes of light that can be used for measurement of movement frequencies or for analysis or timing of moving objects. An automotive timing light is a specialized stroboscope used to manually set the ignition timing of an internal combustion engine.

Stroboscopic visual training (SVT) is a recent tool aimed at improving visual and perceptual performance of sporters by executing activities under conditions of modulated lighting or intermittent vision.

== Unwanted effects in common lighting ==
Stroboscopic effect is one of the particular temporal light artefacts. In common lighting applications, the stroboscopic effect is an unwanted effect which may become visible if a person is looking at a moving or rotating object which is illuminated by a time-modulated light source. The temporal light modulation may come from fluctuations of the light source itself or may be due to the application of certain dimming or light level regulation technologies. Another cause of light modulations may be lamps with unfiltered pulse-width modulation type external dimmers. Whether this is so may be tested with any quickly-rotating object.

=== Effects ===
Various scientific committees have assessed the potential health, performance and safety-related aspects resulting from temporal light modulations (TLMs) including stroboscopic effect. Adverse effects in common lighting application areas include annoyance, reduced task performance, visual fatigue and headache. The visibility aspects of stroboscopic effect are given in a technical note of CIE, see CIE TN 006:2016 and in the thesis of Perz.

Stroboscopic effects may also lead to unsafe situations in workplaces with fast moving or rotating machinery. If the frequency of fast rotating machinery or moving parts coincides with the frequency, or multiples of the frequency, of the light modulation, the machinery can appear to be stationary, or to move with another speed, potentially leading to hazardous situations. Stroboscopic effects that become visible in rotating objects are also referred to as the wagon-wheel effect.

In general, undesired effects in the visual perception of a human observer induced by light intensity fluctuations are called Temporal Light Artefacts (TLAs). Further background and explanations on the different TLA phenomena including stroboscopic effect is given in a recorded webinar “&quot;Is it all just flicker?&quot;”.

Possible stroboscopic induced medical issues in some people include migraines &amp; headaches, autistic repetitive behaviors, eye strain &amp; fatigue, reduced visual task performance, anxiety and (rarer) epileptic seizures.

=== Root causes ===
Light emitted from lighting equipment such as luminaires and lamps may vary in strength as function of time, either intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional light variations are applied for warning, signalling (e.g. traffic-light signalling, flashing aviation light signals), entertainment (like stage lighting) with the purpose that flicker is perceived by people. Generally, the light output of lighting equipment may also have residual unintentional light level modulations due to the lighting equipment technology in connection with the type of electrical mains connection. For example, lighting equipment connected to a single-phase mains supply will typically have residual TLMs of twice the mains frequency, either at 100 or 120 Hz (depending on country).

The magnitude, shape, periodicity and frequency of the TLMs will depend on many factors such as the type of light source, the electrical mains-supply frequency, the driver or ballast technology and type of light regulation technology applied (e.g. pulse-width modulation). If the modulation frequency is below the flicker fusion threshold and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain level, then such TLMs are perceived as flicker. Light modulations with modulation frequencies beyond the flicker fusion threshold are not directly perceived, but illusions in the form of stroboscopic effect may become visible (example see Figure 1).

LEDs do not intrinsically produce temporal modulations; they just reproduce the input current waveform very well, and any ripple in the current waveform is reproduced by a light ripple because LEDs have a fast response; therefore, compared to conventional lighting technologies (incandescent, fluorescent), for LED lighting more variety in the TLA properties is seen. Many types and topologies of LED driver circuits are applied; simpler electronics and limited or no buffer capacitors often result in larger residual current ripple and thus larger temporal light modulation.

Dimming technologies of either externally applied dimmers (incompatible dimmers) or internal light-level regulators may have additional impact on the level of stroboscopic effect; the level of temporal light modulation generally increases at lower light levels.

&quot;NOTE – The root cause temporal light modulation is often referred to as flicker. Also, stroboscopic effect is often referred to as flicker. Flicker is however a directly visible effect resulting from light modulations at relatively low modulation frequencies, typically below 80 Hz, whereas stroboscopic effect in common (residential) applications may become visible if light modulations are present with modulation frequencies, typically above 80 Hz.&quot;

=== Mitigation ===
Generally, undesirable stroboscopic effect can be avoided by reducing the level of TLMs.

Design of lighting equipment to reduce the TLMs of the light sources is typically a tradeoff for other product properties and generally increases cost and size, shortens lifetime or lowers energy efficiency.

For instance, to reduce the modulation in the current to drive LEDs, which also reduces the visibility of TLAs, a large storage capacitor, such as electrolytic capacitor, is required. However, use of such capacitors significantly shortens the lifetime of the LED, as they are found to have the highest failure rate among all components. Another solution to lower the visibility of TLAs is to increase the frequency of the driving current, however this decreases the efficiency of the system and it increases its overall size.

=== Visibility ===
Stroboscopic effect becomes visible if the modulation frequency of the TLM is in the range of 80 Hz to 2000 Hz and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain level. Other important factors that determine the visibility of TLMs as stroboscopic effect are:

* The shape of the temporary modulated light waveform (e.g. sinusoidal, rectangular pulse and its duty cycle);
* The illumination level of the light source;
* The speed of movement of the moving objects observed;
* Physiological factors such as age and fatigue.
All observer-related influence quantities are stochastic parameters, because not all humans perceive the effect of same light ripple in the same way. That is why perception of stroboscopic effect is always expressed with a certain probability. For light levels encountered in common applications and for moderate speeds of movement of objects (connected to speeds that can be made by humans), an average sensitivity curve has been derived based on perception studies. The average sensitivity curve for sinusoidal modulated light waveforms, also called the stroboscopic effect contrast threshold function, as a function of frequency &quot;f&quot; is as follows:

:formula_1

The contrast threshold function is depicted in Figure 2. Stroboscopic effect becomes visible if the modulation frequency of the TLM is in the region between approximately 10 Hz to 2000 Hz and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain level. The contrast threshold function shows that at modulation frequencies near 100 Hz, stroboscopic effect will be visible at relatively low magnitudes of modulation. Although stroboscopic effect in theory is also visible in the frequency range below 100 Hz, in practice visibility of flicker will dominate over stroboscopic effect in the frequency range up to 60 Hz. Moreover, large magnitudes of intentional repetitive TLMs with frequencies below 100 Hz are unlikely to occur in practice because residual TLMs generally occur at modulation frequencies that are twice the mains frequency (100 Hz or 120 Hz).

Detailed explanations on the visibility of stroboscopic effect and other temporal light artefacts are also given in CIE TN 006:2016 and in a recorded webinar “&quot;Is it all just flicker?&quot;”.

=== Objective assessment of stroboscopic effect ===

==== Stroboscopic effect visibility meter ====
For objective assessment of stroboscopic effect the &quot;stroboscopic effect visibility measure&quot; (SVM) has been developed.  The specification of the stroboscopic effect visibility meter and the test method for objective assessment of lighting equipment is published in IEC technical report IEC TR 63158. &quot;SVM&quot; is calculated using the following summation formula:

: formula_2

where &quot;C&quot;m is the relative amplitude of the m-th Fourier component (trigonometric Fourier series representation) of the relative illuminance (relative to the DC-level);

&quot;T&quot;m is the stroboscopic effect contrast threshold function for visibility of stroboscopic effect of a sine wave at the frequency of the m-th Fourier component (see ). &quot;SVM&quot; can be used for objective assessment by a human observer of visible stroboscopic effects of temporal light modulation of lighting equipment in general indoor applications, with typical indoor light levels (&gt; 100 lx) and with moderate movements of an observer or a nearby handled object (&lt; 4 m/s). For assessing unwanted stroboscopic effects in other applications, such as the misperception of rapidly rotating or moving machinery in a workshop for example, other metrics and methods can be required or the assessment can be done by subjective testing (observation).

&quot;NOTE – Several alternative metrics such as modulation depth, flicker percentage or flicker index are being applied for specifying the stroboscopic effect performance of lighting equipment. None of these metrics are suitable to predict actual human perception because human perception is impacted by modulation depth, modulation frequency, wave shape and if applicable the duty cycle of the TLM.&quot;

==== Matlab toolbox ====
A Matlab stroboscopic effect visibility measure toolbox including a function for calculating &quot;SVM&quot; and some application examples are available on the Matlab Central via the Mathworks Community.

==== Acceptance criterion ====
If the value of SVM equals one, the input modulation of the light waveform produces a stroboscopic effect that is just visible, i.e. at the visibility threshold. This means that an average observer will be able to detect the artefact with a probability of 50%. If the value of the visibility measure is above unity, the effect has a probability of detection of more than 50%. If the value of the visibility measure is smaller than unity, the probability of detection is less than 50%. These visibility thresholds show the average detection of an average human observer in a population. This does not, however, guarantee acceptability. For some less critical applications, the acceptability level of an artefact might be well above the visibility threshold. For other applications, the acceptable levels might be below the visibility threshold. NEMA 77-2017 amongst others gives guidance for acceptance criteria in different applications.
==== Test and measurement applications ====
A typical test setup for stroboscopic effect testing is shown in Figure 3. The stroboscopic effect visibility meter can be applied for different purposes (see IEC TR 63158):

* Measurement of the intrinsic stroboscopic-effect performance of lighting equipment when supplied with a stable mains voltage;
* Testing the effect of light regulation of lighting equipment or the effect of an external dimmer (dimmer compatibility).

=== Publication of standards development organisations ===

# IEC TR 63158:2018: includes the stroboscopic effect visibility meter specification and verification method, and test procedures a.o. for dimmer compatibility.
# NEMA 77-2017: amongst others, flicker test Methods and guidance for acceptance criteria.

==Dangers in workplaces==
Stroboscopic effect may lead to unsafe situations in workplaces with fast moving or rotating machinery. If the frequency of fast rotating machinery or moving parts coincides with the frequency, or multiples of the frequency, of the light modulation, the machinery can appear to be stationary, or to move with another speed, potentially leading to hazardous situations.

Because of the illusion that the stroboscopic effect can give to moving machinery, it is advised that single-phase lighting is avoided. For example, a factory that is lit from a single-phase supply with basic lighting will have a flicker of 100 or 120 Hz (depending on country, 50 Hz x 2 in Europe, 60 Hz x 2 in US, double the nominal frequency), thus any machinery rotating at multiples of 50 or 60 Hz (3000–3600rpm) may appear to not be turning, increasing the risk of injury to an operator. Solutions include deploying the lighting over a full 3-phase supply, or by using high-frequency controllers that drive the lights at safer frequencies or direct current lighting.

The 100/120 Hertz stroboscopic effect in commercial lighting may lead to disruptive issues and non-productive results in workspaces such as hospitals &amp; medical facilities, industrial facilities, offices, schools or video conferencing rooms.

<text>Karpinskiy is a lunar impact crater that lies in the northern part of the Moon on the far side from the Earth. This crater is concentric with a larger and older formation lying along the southern rim. This combined rim gives Karpinskiy a larger and wider interior wall along its south face. Just to the north is the double-crater formation of Milankovic and Ricco, which lies across the northern part of the large crater containing Karpinskiy. To the southeast of Karpinskiy is the smaller crater Schjellerup.

The inner wall of Karpinskiy is d, particularly along the northern half. The southern half is irregular and wide, but lacks a well-defined terrace system. A small crater lies along the southern inner wall. The interior floor is flatter in the northern half and somewhat rough and hilly in the south, particularly near the crater midpoint. There is a rille system in the northern part of the floor, with the most prominent rille following an arc that nearly parallels the inner wall, coming closest to the edge in the northeast where is joins the rim of a small, bowl-shaped crater.

The crater is sometimes spelled &quot;Karpinsky&quot;. It is named after Alexander Karpinsky (1846–1936), Russian geologist.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Karpinskiy.

<doc id="1135208" wikidata="Q370904" url="?curid=1135208" title="Liebherr T 282 series">
<text>The Liebherr T 282 series are off-highway, ultra class, rigid frame, two axle, diesel-electric, AC powertrain haul trucks designed and manufactured in the United States by Liebherr Mining Equipment Co.

The Liebherr T 282 series is no longer in production, however, due to the extended service life of this equipment, many are still in operation on mines around the world. The T 282 series is succeeded by the Liebherr T 284.

== T 282 ==
The 1998 T 282 offers a payload of up to and was built specifically for high-production mining applications worldwide. The T 282 was succeeded by the T 282 B, designed in Newport News, Virginia with a payload capacity.

=== Development and testing ===
Liebherr developed a payload capacity haul truck for large-scale mining operations.

Engineers at Liebherr Mining Equipment Newport News Co. designed the T 282 to have the lightest Empty Vehicle Weight (EVW) respective to its payload capacity. The T 282 was the first mining haul truck designed by Liebherr following the company&#x27;s acquisition of existing haul truck manufacturing company, WISEDA, LTD.

The first T 282s were tested extensively at Liebherr&#x27;s proving grounds.

=== Features ===
The T 282 standard features included air suspension seats, double shell concept for safety, thermal and acoustical isolation, emergency engine shutdown, environmentally controlled cab, safety glass with tinted windshield, cast steel components in stress areas, double a-frame front suspension system with inclined king pin, back up warning alarm, and more.

Optional features included L&amp;M radiator, monitoring systems, special paint, cold climate kit, AM/FM radio with cassette player, electric starter, engine heater, canopy spill guards, body liner, and more. 

==== Engine ====
The T 282 is powered by an electric drive system.

===Manufacturing and assembly===
No longer in production, the T 282 B was assembled at the Liebherr Mining Equipment Co. production facility in Newport News, Virginia.

The chassis (frame, axle box, engine, radiator, fan, and alternator) are assembled for shipment alongside the superstructure (operators&#x27; cabin, grid box, and drive system). All other components are implemented on-site with the customer.

== T 282 B ==
The 2004 Liebherr T 282 B offers a payload of up to and was built specifically for high-production mining applications worldwide. The T 282 B succeeds the T 282.

=== Development and testing ===
In October 2003, Liebherr introduced the T 282 B haul truck for large-scale mining operations to reduce cost and increase productivity. The large dump body allowed for each T 282 B operating to carry more material per haul, with fewer trips from loading tool to fill pile.

Engineers at Liebherr Mining Equipment Newport News Co. designed the truck to have the largest haul truck payload capacity in the world at the time of release; with one of the lightest Empty Vehicle Weight (EVW) at , making for a highly productive truck with a relatively low operating cost. The T 282 B requires fewer operating hours to achieve the same level of production as trucks produced by other companies. The low EVW was achievable due to the lightweight AC drive system, use of less heavy components, and &quot;stress flow&quot; design, which allowed for lighter steel structures and casings, which in turn yield a lighter and stronger frame.

The first T 282 Bs were tested extensively at Liebherr&#x27;s proving grounds.

=== Public debut ===
Liebherr introduced the T 282 B at the Bauma trade fair in Munich, Germany, on March 29, 2004. The T 282 B is the successor to the T 282, designed in Newport News, a payload capacity, diesel/AC electric drive haul truck introduced in 1998. At the time of its launch in 2004, the T 282 B offered the largest haul truck payload capacity in the world, and remained unmatched in payload capacity for over four years.

=== Features ===
The T 282 B standard features include an in-cab display screen displaying truck status, fuel consumption, and payload monitoring and downloads. All Liebherr mining trucks include HVAC for operator comfort. The T 282 B is fully compatible with the Liebherr Trolley Assist System, built to save on fuel consumption without sacrificing productivity. Trolley assist is only available for trucks with electric drive systems.

====Powertrain and engine====
The T 282 B is powered by a diesel/electric powertrain. The diesel engine is coupled to a Siemens-Liebherr AC electric drive system. Fully loaded, the T 282 B can achieve a top speed of .

Two diesel engines are available:

* a DDC/MTU 20V4000, V20
* Cummins QSK 78 V18.

==== Braking systems ====
The T 282 B features an electric dynamic retard with continuously rated, fan-forced air over stainless steel resistor grid, with a dry disc secondary braking system. Additional features include extended speed range, cruise control, two speed over speed, slip slide traction control, front/rear service brakes, hydraulic accumulators, park brakes, and filtration.

===Manufacturing and assembly===
No longer in production, the T 282 B was assembled at the Liebherr Mining Equipment Co. production facility in Newport News.

The chassis (frame, axle box, engine, radiator, fan, and alternator) are assembled for shipment alongside the superstructure (operators&#x27; cabin, grid box, and drive system). All other components are implemented on-site with the customer.

===Specifications===
== T 282 C ==
The 2010 Liebherr T 282 C offers a payload of up to with an Empty Vehicle Weight (EVW) of and was built specifically for high-production mining applications worldwide. The T 282 C succeeds the T 282 B, introduced in 2004. The T 282 series is succeeded by the Liebherr T 284.

=== Development and testing ===
In 2010, Liebherr Mining Equipment Newport News Co. designed the T 282 C for reduced cycle time and to have the highest payload-to-EVW in its class, at . The combination of its high power diesel engine with the efficient Litronic Plus drive system maximizes productivity while reducing fuel consumption.

Engineers incorporated the Litronic Plus drive system and improvements to the electrical systems, including machine health and monitoring systems to offer real-time diagnostics for instantaneous improved reliability and maintainability.

The first T 282 Cs were tested extensively at Liebherr&#x27;s proving grounds.

=== Public debut ===
The T 282 C was unveiled at the Bauma trade fair in Munich, Germany, in April 2010.

=== Features ===
The T 282 C standard features include the Litronic Plus drive system with real-time fault warning and detection system, CAN Bus technology for flexible monitoring, truck diagnostics, air ride seats with 3 point seatbelts, improved HVAC, greater visibility, and an integrated colour touch screen in operator cab (displays truck status, fuel consumption, payload monitoring, and downloads).

==== Litronic Plus IGBT AC drive system ====
Designed for mining environments, the control cabinet with integrated rectifier is liquid-cooled, and includes a ground fault warning and detection system. The pressurized cabinet for dust control requires fewer components than GTO drive systems.

==== Tier 2 engine ====
The T 282 C engine is a Tier 2, EPA-compliant diesel MTU/DD 20V4000 engine, configurable up to . Water-cooled turbo chargers and exhaust manifold keep the engine cool, while the ADEC engine control module monitors fuel consumption and exhaust temperatures at multiple points.

==== Improved electrical systems ====
The T 282 C electrical system has a number of improvements over the T 282 B, including moving the rectifier to the control box, reducing the wiring with Harnessflex conduit, protection against dirt and water ingress via heat shrink connectors, and reducing voltage drip for the starting circuit.

=== Manufacturing and assembly ===
No longer in production, the T 282 C was manufactured and assembled at the Liebherr Mining Equipment Co. production facility in Newport News. 

The chassis (frame, axle box, engine, radiator, fan, and alternator) are assembled for shipment alongside the superstructure (operators&#x27; cabin, grid box, and drive system). All other components are implemented on-site with the customer.

===Specifications===
==Transportation of the T 282 series==
Due to its exceptional size and weight, the T 282 series cannot be driven on public roads. The T 282 series was shipped in component form to the customer site before undergoing final assembly.

== Cost of the T 282 series ==
No longer in production, the price of each T 282 model varied based upon customer specification and quantity ordered. Each T 282 truck cost US$4–5 million and Liebherr previously sold dozens of the T 282 series each year, primarily to coal, copper, iron ore and gold mine operators in the U.S., Chile, Indonesia, South Africa and Australia.

== Service life of the T 282 series ==
Liebherr offers a flexible component exchange program for replacement of all major components, and maintains affiliates around the world for speedy parts deliveries. The design life of the truck is dependent upon the chassis and frame, which typically last for an average of 72,000 hours.

==Competition==
The T 282 B competed directly with other payload capacity haul trucks, such as are made by Caterpillar Inc..

<text>Keldysh is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon, at the eastern rim of the Mare Frigoris. It lies due north of the prominent crater Atlas, and to the northeast of the notable Hercules.

The crater rim is generally circular, although it gives the appearance of a slight eastward bulge. The rim edge is sharp and displays little appearance of wear, with only a tiny craterlet along the eastern edge. The inner wall slopes down without s to the ejecta along the base. The interior floor is relatively featureless and is free of notable impacts or ridges.

This crater was previously designated Hercules A, a satellite crater of Hercules, before being renamed by the IAU in 1982.

<doc id="1135226" wikidata="Q5121817" url="?curid=1135226" title="Circus Juventas">
<text>Circus Juventas (formerly Circus of the Star) is a youth performing arts circus school located in Saint Paul, Minnesota, serving youth throughout the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. The organization was founded in 1994 by Dan and Betty Butler, and offers circus arts training to young people ranging from 3 to 21 years old.

Emulating the style of Cirque du Soleil, Circus Juventas&#x27;s first show was at Saint Paul&#x27;s Highland Fest in 1995. From there, the school&#x27;s enrollment quickly expanded and the organization initiated a campaign to fund a $2.1 million permanent big top facility, which opened in 2001 on Saint Paul parkland in the Highland Park neighborhood. That year, it began to produce annual summer performances showcasing the work of its most advanced students, each with a distinct theme. Yearly themed December holiday shows were added starting in 2020 after that year&#x27;s summer show was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

These shows have proven popular with local audiences and have been well received critically, with reviewers praising the professionalism and fearlessness exhibited in the productions, while noting students&#x27; occasional missteps during performances. Circus Juventas students have performed and competed both around the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area and abroad. As of 2014, Juventas was the largest youth performing arts circus in North America. The school had tentative plans to add a second facility elsewhere in the region.

==History==
The founders of Circus Juventas, Dan and Betty Butler, met as teenagers at the Sailor Circus of Sarasota during the mid-1970s. Dan was a catcher on the flying trapeze, and Betty was an aerialist on the cloud swing. They began dating at age sixteen, went on to perform at Florida State University&#x27;s Flying High Circus, and married in 1980. Dan became a successful real estate broker in Atlanta, but faced bankruptcy and chemical dependency. The couple came to reside in Minnesota because Dan Butler was receiving alcohol and drug abuse rehabilitation at Hazelden. The Butlers attended Sailor Circus reunions together and after one, in April 1994, Betty Butler wondered, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we could do something in ?&quot;
The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as a nonprofit corporation in October 1994, citing a desire to give back to the community as one of the reasons for its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota&#x27;s nickname, The North Star State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved the program, and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed with the program and performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in the program increased. By 1996, 30 more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined the program. The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center&#x27;s gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students.

With the school&#x27;s growing popularity, the Butlers saw the need for a larger space so they developed plans to build a 1,500-seat facility. In an article published in the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; in 1997, the estimated cost of the project was quoted at $700,000, with a groundbreaking planned for April 1998. The Butlers initiated their capital campaign on February 18, 1998, with the goal of raising $1.1 million for their new building. By August 1999, they had raised $1 million of their expanded $1.6 million goal for the circus expansion, with plans to break ground on the new facility that November. Part of the funding came from Saint Paul&#x27;s Sales Tax Revitalization (STAR) program, through which surplus funds were distributed by councilmembers to worthy organizations. A total of $627,183 was disbursed for the circus through the program, split between three STAR components: $450,000 as part of Neighborhood STAR which sought to fund local initiatives, $122,183 as part of Cultural STAR which funded arts and culture programs, and $55,000 from 3rd Ward City Councilmember Pat Harris&#x27;s discretionary Neighborhood Investment Initiative budget. Another $60,000 came from an anonymous recently retired Saint Paul businessperson.
The $1.6 million were raised in full by the end of April 2000, just in time to ensure the circus received its STAR funding which would have been nullified if the Butlers had not made their fundraising goal by May 5 of that year. The Butlers had found the space for the school through coincidence; after driving along Montreal Avenue in Saint Paul one night, they turned into a parking lot, noticed an area beneath some trees, and realized it was an ideal location for their school&#x27;s expanded facility. On August 25, 2000, ground was broken on the new structure. The big top took about a year to complete, during which time the school also changed its name to Circus Juventas, named for Juventas, an ancient Roman goddess of youth and rejuvenation. Ultimately, the project totaled $2.1 million and by 2006, the school was $700,000 in debt. It was working with various city agencies to resolve the shortfall and faced &quot;no looming threat.&quot; The school relies heavily on parent volunteers to help with various operational aspects, from rigging to administrative work to set construction and decoration, and concessions sales. Betty Butler estimated that 90 percent of work on the school&#x27;s shows is done by parent volunteers. The circus operates with the equivalent of 40 full-time employees.

In 2010, the circus school enrolled students from ages 6 to 21, with an additional enrollment of about 150 toddlers and other younger participants as young as three years old. By 2013, the enrollment had reached over 800 and the school&#x27;s annual operating budget exceeded $2 million. Circus Juventas has also held circus arts fitness classes for adults, taught by the school&#x27;s regular instructors. The school is a member of the Outdoor Amusement Business Association and the Fédération Mondiale du Cirque. A listing on the latter organization&#x27;s website notes that as of 2014, Juventas is the largest performing arts circus school for youth in the United States; other sources indicate that it is the largest in all of North America.

==Facilities==
Circus Juventas&#x27;s big top is located in the Highland Park neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota. It stands tall and encompasses of floor space built on concrete slab. The structure is supported by an aluminum frame and covered with flame-resistant vinyl-coated cloth. The building&#x27;s lobby space was designed by Locus Architecture, Ltd., of Minneapolis. The firm connected texteline fabric (often used for awnings) to the system of catwalks and supports to help &quot;the lobby act...as an immersion tank, rather than a threshold, to introduce spectators to the illusion of the world of circus.&quot; Although Locus was still installing the fabric within hours of the circus&#x27;s gala opening, the company won one of the 10 honor awards distributed in 2002 by the Minnesota branch of the American Institute of Architects for their design. The circus school&#x27;s original bleachers could seat 1,200 audience members.

===Bleacher collapse===

On August 16, 2009, at the closing performance of the show &quot;Yulong&quot;, a set of bleachers with a carrying capacity of 450 people and holding 420 at the time collapsed, sending seven people to the hospital. In the ensuing investigation, it came to light that Juventas had not had the bleachers inspected each time they were set up, as required by their lease with the city. They had been issued a permit in 2006 for the bleachers, and had not had them inspected since. The school was fined $500 and shut down until the legal and safety issues could be fully investigated. It reopened about a month later and installed new bleachers with molded plastic seats the next March.

===Future===
In early 2014, the Butlers announced plans to expand their big top facility by an additional . The additional space would house a dance and theater studio, a costume shop, offices, and a gym. Naming rights for the new structure would provide a component of the $4 million the school hoped to raise for the $2 million expansion, a $1 million addition to the circus&#x27;s endowment, and eventual repairs to the building&#x27;s exterior, estimated at $1 million. Betty Butler stated that the project stemmed from the desire to create &quot;a true professional program, a separate program&quot; for students looking to study and perform circus arts post-Juventas, even though she and her husband originally shied away from pre-professional training as a core aspect of their circus school.

According to Saint Paul&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department, the cliffside space which the expansion would occupy was deemed unsuitable for building a structure of the expansion&#x27;s proposed size. In response, the Butlers were considering building a new facility of up to in the western suburbs of Minneapolis–Saint Paul. Construction of a new building would likely cost $10 million, require a capital campaign to fund, and probably not begin for five to 10 years. In the meantime, the school is performing a small expansion to its Highland Park space, on which the Circus has a lease for at least 17 more years, as of 2014.

==Performances==
The school typically puts on three shows each year: a spring performance featuring less advanced students studying circus arts at beginning and intermediate levels, a late-summer show to display the talents of more advanced students, and a December holiday show. While the earliest shows were focused primarily on technique and the individual acts, by 1997 or 1998 the school began to emphasize the artistic side of performances, including integrating those acts into Cirque du Soleil-style narratives. Holiday shows were introduced beginning in 2020 after the planned summer show that year was cancelled on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. The school also hosts an annual gala in late autumn that includes portions of the year&#x27;s earlier summer performance. Circus Juventas does not utilize animal acts in its shows.

===Other engagements===
In addition to shows at their Saint Paul big top, Juventas students have performed across the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metro area and at domestic and international shows and competitions. Performers have appeared at local events including the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, Minneapolis mayor R. T. Rybak&#x27;s 2002 inauguration at the Minneapolis City Hall, and at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts as part of the Flint Hills International Children&#x27;s Festival. Students have presented their work at a variety of local public, retail, and theater spaces. Students have also participated non-Juventas shows, including a 2004 Minnesota Fringe Festival production, the 2005 world premiere of &quot;Tin Forest&quot; with the Minnesota Orchestra at Orchestra Hall, the Children&#x27;s Theatre Company&#x27;s 2008 stage adaptation of &quot;Madeline and the Gypsies&quot;, and the 2012 adaptation of Jack Prelutsky&#x27;s &quot;The Dragons Are Singing Tonight&quot; at The Southern Theater. In 2010, a cohort of Juventas students traveled to perform in Chattanooga, Tennessee, at the RiverRocks Festival. Outside the United States, performers have traveled to compete, including at the International Circus Festival in Latina, Italy, and at the Circus Ring of Friendship Festival in Norrköping, Sweden, in which the troupe&#x27;s triple trapeze team garnered the gold medal. In April 2015, a Circus Juventas spinning cube team performed at the Circus Waldoni Festival in Darmstadt, Germany, where they tied for first place. Students from the school will perform at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., in June and July 2017.

==Music==

Much of the accompaniment for the big top summer shows came from Peter Ostroushko, a local mandolin player. Ostroushko, known for his work on the radio show &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, became involved in the youth circus after his daughter saw a show and decided to join. In 2005, the Butlers discovered Ostroushko&#x27;s affinity for the mandolin and fiddle, and asked if he would play a Celtic song at the premiere of their upcoming summer big top show, &quot;Dyrnwych&quot;. He happily agreed, having expressed a lifelong dream of joining a circus, and played the track, &quot;See It There/Con Cassidy&#x27;s&quot;, not only at &quot;Dyrnwych&quot; opening but also at each of its subsequent 18 performances. The following year, he composed original music for the 2006 Juventas show, &quot;Pazzanni&quot;, and expanded his band to five members, including himself on mandolin, fiddle, and mandocello, Marc Anderson on percussion, Dan Chouinard on piano, accordion, and keyboard, Dirk Freymuth on electric and acoustic guitars, and Joel Sayles on electric and acoustic bass guitars. Ostroushko again provided a score for &quot;Atlanticus&quot; and &quot;RavensManor&quot;, continued in 2010 with &quot;Sawdust&quot;, then &quot;Grimm&quot;, and finally &quot;Showdown&quot;. Tracks from the first four shows for which he played, from &quot;Dyrnwych&quot; to &quot;RavensManor&quot;, are anthologized on the album &quot;Peter Joins the Circus&quot;, published by Borderland Productions in 2008.

==Reception==
Jando Dominique, reporting for &quot;Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts&quot;, summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas&#x27;s shows by describing them as &quot;always sold out and enthusiastically reviewed by the press.&quot; Renee Valois cited the age of the performers and the proximity between them and the audience when she asked in a &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; review of &quot;Oz&quot; comparing the circus school with Cirque du Soleil, &quot;Dare I say Circus Juventas is more exciting than the troupe that inspired it?&quot; Writing for &quot;Minnesota Monthly&quot;, Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012&#x27;s &quot;Showdown&quot;: &quot;There is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through the air like pros.&quot; In &quot;Spectacle&quot;, Dominique noted that Juventas&#x27;s productions consistently have &quot;a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter.&quot;

Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, &quot;at two hours and 45 minutes, plus a 20-minute intermission, [&quot;Grimm&quot;] run time is an awfully long haul for the smallest circus-goers.&quot; Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of &quot;Grimm&quot; that &quot;there are moments – just a few stand out – when you realize that these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always.&quot; Similarly, writing for &quot;BroadwayWorld&quot;, Elaina Lenertz stated, &quot;Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive.&quot;

<text>FC Lokomotiv Moscow (&quot;FC Lokomotiv Moskva&quot;, , ) is a Russian professional football club based in Moscow. Lokomotiv have won the Russian Premier League on three occasions; the Soviet Cup twice; and the Russian Cup a record nine times. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Club Association suspended all Russian teams from participation in international competition.

==History==

===Early years===
Lokomotiv was founded as Kazanka (Moskovsko-Kazanskaya Zh.D) in 1922. In 1924, the club brought together the strongest football players of several lines of the Moscow railway system as KOR (&quot;Club of the October Revolution&quot;). In 1931, the club was again renamed to Kazanka (Moskovskaya-Kazanskaya Zh.D) and in 1936, it was eventually renamed to as it is known today, Lokomotiv (the name means &quot;Locomotive&quot;). During the Communist rule, Lokomotiv Moscow club was a part of the Lokomotiv Voluntary Sports Society and was owned by the Soviet Ministry of Transportation through the Russian Railways.

===Soviet era===

When the Lokomotiv Voluntary Sports Society was created in 1936, its football team featured the best players of &quot;Kazanka&quot;, and a number of strong Soviet footballers of that time such as Valentin Granatkin, Nikolay llyin, Alexey Sokolov, Pyotr Terenkov, Mikhail Zhukov, llya Gvozdkov and Ivan Andreev. Lokomotiv debuted in the first-ever Soviet football club championship with a game against Dynamo Leningrad on 22 May 1936. In the first two seasonal championships (spring and autumn), Lokomotiv finished fifth and fourth respectively. The first Lokomotiv success arrived shortly as in 1936, the railwaymen rose up to the occasion to beat Dynamo Tbilisi 2–0 in the Soviet Cup Final, thus winning the first Soviet Cup.

The following years were rather successful as Lokomotiv were consistent in the national championships. However, performances after World War II suffered and in a five-year span, Lokomotiv were relegated to the Soviet First League twice. In 1951, Lokomotiv came second and eventually won the promotion to the Soviet Top League. This kicked off the second Lokomotiv&#x27;s resurgence and until the beginning of the 1960s, Lokomotiv competed for the USSR&#x27;s top trophies. In 1957, Lokomotiv won the cup for the second time, and two years later, Lokomotiv won the silver medals of the Soviet League. Second place was the highest position ever obtained by Lokomotiv during the Soviet era.

Another important trademark for Lokomotiv was the authorization of playing friendly matches against foreign opposition. Typically, up to the late 1950s, international sports contacts with Soviet teams were extremely rare. However, since in 1955, Lokomotiv became a quasi-&quot;football ambassador&quot; for the Soviet Union abroad, participating in friendly matches in various parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, Africa and even North America. This policy of openness ushered in a great era for Lokomotiv, with the squad including some of the finest Soviet footballers of the era, such as Vladimir Maslachenko, Valentin Bubukin, Victor Voroshilov, Zaur Kaloyev, and Yuri Kovalyov. When Lokomotiv&#x27;s strongest players abandoned the club, however, Lokomotiv fell again from grace and a swing between the first and second divisions followed, instability lasting until the end of the 1980s.

===Post-Soviet era===
In the beginning of the 1990s, Lokomotiv was considered the &quot;weakest link&quot; amongst the top Moscow clubs. It lacked both results on the pitch and fans&#x27; support in the stands. In 2002, a new stadium—Lokomotiv Stadium—resembling a traditional, compact English one was built.

In 2002, a &quot;golden match&quot; was needed to decide who will be the champion, as Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow both finished with the same number of points after Gameweek 30. The game was played at Dynamo Stadium in front of a sold-out crowd. Lokomotiv took an early lead thanks a low drive from captain Dmitry Loskov, and eventually the goal turned out to be enough for Lokomotiv to claim the first title in the club&#x27;s history.

Two years later, Lokomotiv again won the Russian Premier League, edging city rivals CSKA by a single point; Lokomotiv defeated Shinnik Yaroslavl 0–2 in Yaroslavl, a week after CSKA fell to city rivals Dynamo at home.

In 2005, long-time head coach Yuri Semin left the team to coach the Russian national team, where he was replaced at Lokomotiv by Vladimir Eshtrekov. During the same year, although leading the league for most of the year, Lokomotiv stumbled in the last games of the campaign, allowing CSKA overtake them and claim the title, with Lokomotiv ultimately falling to third. Estrekhov was later sacked and replaced by Slavoljub Muslin, the first foreign manager in the club&#x27;s history. After a poor start to the new season, Lokomotiv recovered and finished third, but despite the respectable performance, Muslin was sacked; Anatoly Byshovets took the helm as his replacement, with Yury Semin returning to serve as team president. This brought little success to Lokomotiv, who finished the season in seventh, with the only bright spot being the victory of the Russian Cup. These poor performances prompted the board of directors to sack both coach Anatoly Byshovets and President Semin. Rinat Bilyaletdinov was subsequently named caretaker coach. This lasted until 6 December 2006, when Lokomotiv brought in Rashid Rakhimov from Amkar Perm on a three-year contract. Again, however, this resulted to be yet another poor decision from the board, as Lokomotiv only finished seventh in 2008, also beginning the 2009 season poorly. Unsurprisingly, on 28 April 2009, Lokomotiv fired Rakhimov; long-serving player Vladimir Maminov was installed as a caretaker manager. A month later, Semin was brought back to the club to take charge. After a really poor start, Lokomotiv recovered and finished the season on a high, claiming fourth place in the process.

In 2010 shortly after the signing of former Lokomotiv player Peter Odemwingie to West Bromwich Albion, photographs showed Lokomotiv Moscow fans celebrating the sale of Odemwingie through the use of racist banners targeted at the player. One banner included the image of a banana and read &quot;Thanks West Brom&quot;. Before West Brom&#x27;s game against Tottenham Hotspur in September 2010, it was announced that West Brom fans would unfurl a banner to counter the racist one, the banner read &#x27;Thanks Lokomotiv&#x27; and is accompanied by a picture of Odemwingie celebrating his win on his debut against Sunderland.

Before the 2011–12 league season, Semin left the club and was replaced by former Spartak Nalchuk manager Yuri Krasnozhan. On 4 June 2011, rumours spread that Lokomotiv chairman Olga Smorodskaya suspected Krasnozhan of throwing away the 27 May, 1–2 home league defeat to Anzhi Makhachkala, deciding to sack him on the grounds of the suspicion. Lokomotiv was fifth in the table at the time, just one point away from first-placed CSKA. On 6 July, after a Lokomotiv Committee of Directors meeting, Krasnozhan&#x27;s contract was officially terminated on the basis of &quot;negligence in his job.&quot; The Russian Football Union subsequently refused to investigate the case. Assistant manager Maminov again took over as caretaker for three weeks until a replacement was found in the form of José Couceiro, who had himself just finished a caretaking stint as manager of Sporting Clube de Portugal.

Couceiro, however, lasted just one year in the role, as the club opted not to renew his contract at the end of the 2011–12 season. After Croatia national team head coach Slaven Bilić announced he would step down after his nation&#x27;s participation at Euro 2012, Loko acted quickly to sign him to a three-year contract. However, Bilić&#x27;s first season at the helm brought another disappointment, as Loko finished ninth, its lowest-ever finish in the post-Soviet era of Russian domestic football. Just prior to the 2013–14 season, Bilić was sacked and replaced with new head coach Leonid Kuchuk. Eventually, however, Lokomotiv ran out of steam and after only managing to win a single points from the last three matches of the season, Lokomotiv had to settle for the third place.

=== Recent history ===

In the following season, Kuchuk failed to build up on the improved performances of the previous season and with Lokomotiv languished at the ninth place, Kuchuk was given the sack prematurely. Miodrag Božović was called to steady the ship but despite the early promise, a disastrous run of one win in a stretch of nine matches resulted in Božović being sacked with three league matches to go and with Igor Cherevchenko re-appointed as caretaker manager for the second time during the season. Despite the poor league performance, wherein Lokomotiv placed in the 7th place again, Lokomotiv did end the season on a positive tone as Cherevchenko managed to rally his troops and win the Russian Cup with a 3–1 win over Kuban Krasnodar. This success, which brought the first piece of silverware to Lokomotiv in 8 years, was enough to convince Olga Smorodskaya to appoint Cherevchenko on a permanent basis. Lokomotiv&#x27;s performances under Cherechenko did improve in the beginning but it was a false promise once again as in the end Lokomotiv faltered and did not manage to qualify for European football. Notwithstanding this, Cherevchenko was confirmed for the 2016–17 season.

After months of speculation, and with only two games in the new season, the board pulled the plug on Smorodskaya&#x27;s disastrous tenure and relieved Smorodskaya hand Cherechenko from their positions. Ilya Herkus was brought in for Smorodskaya and with the goal of resolving the previous board&#x27;s fractious relationship with the fans and bring them back to the stadium, Lokomotiv appointed Yury Semin as their manager for the fourth time. In also came crowd favourite Dmitri Loskov, who was assigned to assist Semin with his duties. Despite the good feelings brought by the change in management, Lokomotiv&#x27;s performances seldom improved and a tumultuous season ended up in Lokomotiv placing in a disappointing eighth position. In what was the only highlight of the season, Lokomotiv managed to snatch the Russian Cup for a joint record seventh time by crushing Ural Yekaterinburg&#x27;s dreams of their first ever piece of silverware with a two-nil victory.

Despite the average league performance, Semin was confirmed for the next season. Herkus&#x27; decision to retain Semin resulted to be a shrewd decision as Semin managed to do the unthinkable and rallied Lokomotiv to win the Russian Premier League for only the third time in their history. In Europe, Lokomotiv also performed admirably, as they managed to advance to Round of 16 for the first time in their history and got eliminated by Atlético Madrid, who eventually went on to win the Cup.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Club Association suspended the team.
==Performances in Europe==

Lokomotiv reached the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-final twice, in 1997–98 and 1998–99. The club also played in the UEFA Champions League for the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, progressing past the group stage in the latter only to fall to eventual finalists AS Monaco in the round of 16. They qualified to the group stages again for the 2019–20 season.

<text>Manchester Central Library is the headquarters of the city&#x27;s library and information service in Manchester, England. Facing St Peter&#x27;s Square, it was designed by E. Vincent Harris and constructed between 1930 and 1934. The form of the building, a columned portico attached to a rotunda domed structure, is loosely derived from the Pantheon, Rome. At its opening, one critic wrote, &quot;This is the sort of thing which persuades one to believe in the perennial applicability of the Classical canon&quot;.
The library building is grade II* listed. A four-year project to renovate and refurbish the library commenced in 2010. Central Library re-opened on 22 March 2014.

==History==
===Background===
Manchester was the first local authority to provide a public lending and reference library after the passing of the Public Libraries Act 1850. The Manchester Free Library opened at Campfield in September 1852 at a ceremony attended by Charles Dickens.
When the Campfield premises were declared to be unsafe in 1877, the library was moved to the old Town Hall in King Street. The library moved again to what is now Piccadilly Gardens, to the former outpatients wing of Manchester Royal Infirmary and an old YMCA hut in 1912.

In 1926, the city council held a competition to design an extension to the town hall and a central library. E. Vincent Harris was selected to design both buildings. His circular design for the library, reminiscent of the Pantheon in Rome, was based on libraries in America. The library&#x27;s foundation stone was laid on 6 May 1930 by the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The Manchester City Architect G. Noel Hill was involved with the scheme. The library was officially opened by King George V on 17 July 1934 after he had laid the foundation stone for the Town Hall Extension.

In 1934, the Blind Collection from Deansgate and the Commercial Library from the Royal Exchange were moved to the library. The Chinese Library Service was set up in 1968.

===Opening===
The Central Library opened in 1934 to much fanfare. Singer-songwriter Ewan MacColl reminisced on the opening: &quot;The new Central Library which replaced the chicken house was an imposing circular structure with an enormous reading room, a small theatre and carrels where serious students could carry on their research without interruption. The portico of the magnificent edifice quickly became a popular rendezvous and &quot;Meet you at the Ref&quot; became a familiar phrase on the lips of students, lovers and unemployed youths. I was there on the opening day and on many days thereafter; the Ref played an important part in my life for I made many friends there.&quot;

The library was declared open by King George V on 17 July 1934. George V declared to the crowd: &quot;In the splendid building which I am about to open, the largest library in this country provided by a local authority, the Corporation have ensured for the inhabitants of the city magnificent opportunities for further education and for the pleasant use of leisure.&quot;

An employee at the library who was present on opening day said: &quot;When it was being built the public were very intrigued about its final appearance – they were used to rectangular buildings and the shape of the girders used seemed to make little sense. I remember families coming in first to &quot;gawp&quot;... Under the portico became a favourite trysting place. In all, the shape of the building was its best advertisement and it was never necessary to put a notice &#x27;Public Library&#x27; on the outside.&quot;

===Renovation===
Reports emerged in 2008 that the Central Library needed essential renovation to repair and modernise its facilities. The library faced asbestos problems and needed work to maintain its &#x27;structural integrity&#x27;. The Central Library closed from 2010 to 2014 for refurbishment and expansion. During the closure its collections were stored in the Winsford Rock Salt Mine; some of the books in the stack joined collections at Greater Manchester County Record Office. A number of its services were available at a temporary location nearby. During renovation, a temporary community library for the city centre was established on Deansgate. Central Library re-opened on 22 March 2014 after a £40 million re-design. The project delivered by Laing O&#x27;Rourke won the &quot;Construction News&quot; Judges Supreme Award in June 2015. It was described as an almost impossibly complex project completed on schedule and within budget.

The indoor plan is now very different. What was the theatre in the basement is now part of the library. A wall was knocked through, making an indoor connection between the library and Manchester Town Hall. The Library Theatre Company moved to their new theatre at the HOME complex in May 2015.

==Architecture==


Designed by architect Vincent Harris, the striking rotunda form of the library was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. Like its 2nd-century model, the library is a round building fronted by a large two-storey portico which forms the main entrance on St Peter&#x27;s Square, and is surrounded by five bays of Corinthian columns. Around the second and third floors is a Tuscan colonnade, topped by a band of unrelieved Portland stone.

The pitched leaded roof appears from street level to be a dome, but this is only a surrounding roof. The dome that can be seen from within the Great Hall lies within this roof, and cannot be seen from the ground.

On the first floor is the Great Hall, a large reading room topped by a dome. Much of the original furniture designed by the architect can be seen on this floor. Around the rim of the dome is an inscription from the Book of Proverbs in the Old Testament:

In former years, the dome&#x27;s acoustics caused an echo problem, which repeated several times any short noise made in the room. Adding sound-absorbing material reduced this effect.

The Shakespeare Hall is an ornate chamber displaying local heraldry and with large stained glass windows. The central window was designed by Robert Anning Bell and depicts William Shakespeare and scenes from his plays. Two side windows designed by George Kruger Gray depict the coats of arms of the City of Manchester, the University of Manchester, and the County and Duchy of Lancaster. The windows were a memorial bequest to the library by Rosa E. Grindon (1848–1923), the widow of Manchester botanist Leo Grindon.

The ceiling decorations include the arms and crests of the Duchy of Lancaster, the See of York, the See of Manchester, the City of Manchester, and Lancashire County Council. The walls of Shakespeare Hall are covered with Hopton Wood stone quarried in Derbyshire. On the walls are the arms of The Manchester Grammar School, Manchester University, the Manchester Regiment, Humphrey Chetham, the Overseers of the Township, England, St. George, St. Mary (patron saint of Manchester), and over the memorial window, Shakespeare.

On the left landing is a white marble statue, &quot;the Reading Girl&quot; by the Italian sculptor Giovanni Ciniselli. It was bought by the industrialist and promoter of the Manchester Ship Canal, Daniel Adamson. The statue was presented to the library by his grandchildren, the Parkyn family, in 1938.

==Collections==

It is the second largest public lending library in Britain, after the Library of Birmingham.

Beneath the Great Hall were four floors of steel book stacks providing of shelving which accommodated one million books: video. Those floors were only accessible to employees and were environmentally controlled to protect the books, many of which are old and fragile. The upper two stack floors occupied all the area under the dome. The fourth level, the archive unit, was in the basement of the building. The lower two stack floors were smaller because the basement theatre took some of that area. In 2011 when the library closed for the alterations, there were 3,600 stack columns supporting approximately 45,000 shelves; those columns were rooted in the sandstone rock underneath and supported the Great Hall&#x27;s reinforced concrete floor. Placed end to end, those shelves would have covered over . The total floor area was about . After the 2010–2014 alterations, many of the former stack books (except rare or valuable or fragile books) are on public shelves.

The library collections include over 30 incunabula (books published before 1500) and many first and early editions of major works. The special collections include:
* The Gaskell Collection – works by Elizabeth Gaskell, one of the most important writers to have lived and worked in the city
* The Theatre Collection – a record of the history of theatre in Manchester
*The Henry Watson Music library – one of the largest public library collections of sheet music, named after the Mancunian musician and composer Dr Henry Watson (1846–1911) who bequeathed his collection to the library. It was officially opened in 1947 by Sir John Barbirolli.
* The Newman Flower Collection of Handel Manuscripts – acquired from the estate of Sir Newman Flower by the Henry Watson Music library in 1965. This library of rare manuscripts had originally been collected by Charles Jennens, a close friend of George Frederic Handel, and was later held in the collection of the Earl of Aylesford. It contains works by Handel, as well as items of Italian music from the early 18th century, including concerto partbooks of &quot;the Four Seasons&quot; by Antonio Vivaldi. Notably, the collection also includes a number of previously unknown violin sonatas by Vivaldi, autographed by the composer, which are now known as &quot;The Manchester Sonatas&quot;.

==Library Theatre==
The Library Theatre occupied much of the basement of Manchester Central Library and was the home of the Library Theatre Company, a Manchester City Council service. It was built in 1934 as a lecture theatre, and since 1952 had been used by the Library Theatre Company. After the 2011–2014 alterations, its area is now part of the library. A new theatre opened on First Street in partnership with Cornerhouse, Manchester in 2015.

==Memorials==

There is a memorial to those from Greater Manchester who fought in the Spanish Civil War as part of the International Brigades. The inscription reads Voluntarios Internacionales de la Libertad dedicated to the men &amp; women from the Greater Manchester area who fought against fascism in Spain. The memorial was designed by Sol Garson, and unveiled by Cllr. H.T. Lee on 12 February 1983.

==Famous users==
Anthony Burgess, the author who wrote the novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, was a regular visitor to the library during his school days. In a volume of his autobiography, &quot;Little Wilson and Big God&quot; (1987) he recounted his visit to the index system, then in temporary accommodation in Piccadilly, Manchester, where he met an older woman who took him to her flat in Ardwick where she seduced him.

==Statistics==
In 1968 it was recorded that the adult lending stock was 895,000, the adult reference stock 638,200, the junior stock 114,600, a total of nearly 1.65 million volumes. There were about 2,000 reading places and an estimated 10,000 people visited the library each day. There were subscriptions to 3,000 periodicals.

<doc id="1135253" wikidata="Q2118386" url="?curid=1135253" title="Punk Planet">
<text>Punk Planet was a 16,000 print run punk zine, based in Chicago, Illinois, that focused most of its energy on looking at punk subculture rather than punk as simply another genre of music to which teenagers listen. In addition to covering music, &quot;Punk Planet&quot; also covered visual arts and a wide variety of progressive issues — including media criticism, feminism, and labor issues.

The most notable features in &quot;Punk Planet&quot; were the interviews and album reviews. The interviews generally ran two or three pages, and tended to focus on the motivations of the artist (or organizer, activist, or whoever) being interviewed. &quot;Punk Planet&quot; aimed to be more inclusive than the well-known zine &quot;Maximum Rock and Roll&quot;, and tried to review nearly all the records it received, so long as the record label wasn&#x27;t owned or partially owned by a major label. This led to a review section typically longer than thirty pages, covering a variety of musical styles. Although much of the music thus reviewed was, expectedly, aggressive rock, the reviews also covered country, folk, hip-hop, indie rock, and other genres. The Punk Planet reviews section also encompassed independently released comics, zines, and DVDs.

A number of poor distribution deals and the collapse of the Independent Press Association resulted in mounting debts for the editors. As a result, issue 80 was shipped with a cover reading: &quot;This is the final issue of Punk Planet, after this the fight is yours.&quot; Subsidiary business Punk Planet books remains in business.

== History and other projects ==
The first issue of the zine was published in May 1994, in part as a response to the perception that &quot;Maximum Rock and Roll&quot; was becoming too elitist. In September 2006, &quot;Punk Planet&quot; had printed 75 issues of their bi-monthly publication, and in the fall of 2004 launched a book publishing arm, Punk Planet Books, in conjunction with the New York-based small press Akashic Books. Punk Planet Books has published four titles as of May 2006: &quot;Hairstyles of the Damned&quot; by Joe Meno (August 2004, ), “All the Power: Revolution Without Illusion” by Mark Andersen (September 2004, ), “Lessons in Taxidermy” by Bee Lavender (March 2005, ), and &quot;100 Posters, 134 Squirrels&quot; by Jay Ryan (November 2005, ).

In September 2006, Punk Planet partnered with the website, ZineWiki, to publish, online, exclusive articles from past print issues.

On June 18, 2007, a post at www.punkplanet.com informed the public that after 13 years and 80 issues, Punk Planet&#x27;s final issue was being sent out. The reasoning pointed to &quot;bad distribution deals, disappearing advertisers, and a decreasing audience of subscribers.&quot;

As a result, editor Dan Sinker decided to place his focus on the online website, but it has since gone offline. In its place is a statement, &quot;This is it, folks. The Punk Planet website is closed. Two years after the closure of the magazine, it just seemed time.&quot; 

In January 2021, all 80 issues of &quot;Punk Planet&quot; were uploaded to the Internet Archive.

<text>Kramers is an old lunar impact crater that is located on the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies some distance to the west of the larger crater Coulomb, and to the northwest of the smaller Weber, and it was named after Hendrik Anthony Kramers, a Dutch physicist.

The outer rim of Kramers is heavily eroded and worn, although the perimeter of the original crater can be readily discerned. The younger, but comparably sized formation Kramers C intrudes into the northeast rim, and the two form a crater pair. The later crater has a d inner wall and a central peak at the midpoint.

Kramers lies within the Coulomb-Sarton Basin, a 530 km wide impact crater of Pre-Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kramers.

<doc id="1135262" wikidata="Q7542227" url="?curid=1135262" title="Slug and Lettuce (fanzine)">
<text>Slug and Lettuce is a free newsprint punk zine started in State College, Pennsylvania by Christine Boarts in 1987. In 1989 CBL and S&amp;L relocated to New York City where the zine&#x27;s print run steadily grew and increased to 10,000 with free worldwide distribution. In 1997, CBL and S&amp;L relocated to Richmond, Virginia. Its byline reads &quot;A zine supporting the Do-It-Yourself ethics of the punk community&quot;. The print version ended in 2007 with edition #90, and the PO Box was closed in 2016.

==History and profile==
&quot;Slug and Lettuce&quot; was started in 1987. It is published quarterly and is edited by Christine Boarts, who also writes a column for &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot; and runs a book distribution business. She describes her zine as &quot;providing space for communication and networking within underground music and political scenes&quot; and states that &quot;it was through her zine that she forged connections to the larger underground scene which gave her the &#x27;inspiration and dedication&#x27; to chart a course for herself outside the mainstream&quot; (quoted in &quot;Notes from Underground: Zines and the Politics of Alternative Culture&quot;).

==Contents==
Each issue contains columns with DIY/anarcho-punk themes pertaining to anti-authoritarian politics, vegetarian/vegan action, radical parenting, DIY culture, gardening and activism generally. &quot;Slug and Lettuce&quot; also features zine, book, and record reviews and Christine Boarts&#x27; band photography.

&quot;Slug and Lettuce&quot; has featured the comic Zero Content by Fly, the Folk Punk art of Jeremy Clark and the Medieval Punk art of Sean Aaberg.

In issue number 89 in autumn 2006, Christine Boarts announces that issue 90 will be the twentieth anniversary issue. It is postponed to May 2007 owing to her pregnancy. The 20th anniversary issue - #90 came out in the fall of 2007.

==Archive &amp; Website==
In a 2014 Interview, Boarts stated that much of the zine&#x27;s photography and articles had been archived to the zine&#x27;s website.

<text>Nicolai is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere of the Moon, in a region that is less disturbed by significant impacts than most of the highlands. The nearest craters of note are Spallanzani to the south, and the much larger Maurolycus and Barocius to the east. The crater is named after the 19th-century German astronomer Friedrich Bernhard Gottfried Nicolai. It is 42 kilometers in diameter and reaches a depth of 1.8 kilometers.

The outer wall of this crater is worn, with a number of tiny craterlets lying along the rim. The most notable of these is a tiny crater located across the northern rim. The satellite crater Nicolai B is attached to the exterior of the southwest rim. The inner walls slope down relatively smoothly to the flat interior floor filled with lava. The only marking on the inner surface is a tiny craterlet in the northern part of the crater. Nicolai is from the Nectarian period, which lasted from 3.92 billion to 3.85 billion years ago.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Nicolai.

<text>Football Club de Nantes, commonly referred to as FC Nantes or simply Nantes (; ; Gallo: &quot;Naunnt&quot;), is a French professional football club based in Nantes in Pays de la Loire. The club was founded on 21 April 1943, during World War II, as a result of local clubs based in the city coming together to form one large club. From 1992 to 2007, the club was referred to as FC Nantes Atlantique before reverting to its current name at the start of the 2007–08 season. Nantes play in Ligue 1, the first division of Football in France.
Nantes is one of the most successful clubs in French football, having won eight Ligue 1 titles, four Coupe de France wins and attained one Coupe de la Ligue victory.

The club is famous for its &quot;jeu à la nantaise&quot; (), its collective spirit, mainly advocated under coaches José Arribas, Jean-Claude Suaudeau and Raynald Denoueix and for its youth system, which has produced players such as Marcel Desailly, Didier Deschamps, Mickaël Landreau, Claude Makélélé, Christian Karembeu and Jérémy Toulalan. As well as &quot;Les Canaris&quot; (&#x27;The Canaries&#x27;), Nantes is also nicknamed &quot;Les jaunes et verts&quot; (&#x27;The Green and Yellows&#x27;) and &quot;La Maison Jaune&quot; (&#x27;The Yellow House&#x27;).

==History==

===Foundation===
The club was founded in 1943. The first match played by Nantes as a professional team took place at the Stade Olympique de Colombes against CA Paris, where Nantes triumphed 2–0. The first home match was a defeat of the same score against Troyes. The club finished fifth at the end of this first season following which the club&#x27;s manager Aimé Nuic left the club following a dispute, and was succeeded by Antoine Raab, who took over in a player-coach role. After winning 16 consecutive matches, Nantes lost 9–0 to Sochaux.

The club became a professional football club in 1945 after winning the Western Region championship, and started that season in the second division. Under historic president , it spent a few years as a mid-table club in that division, with even threat of relegation in 1950, avoided on the last game only.

===The 1950s===
Results improved from 1951 onwards, and the club just missed out on promotion in 1952, finishing 4th, under respected coach Émile Veinante. His successor Anton Raab was able to recruit more prestigious players, including Dutch stars Gerrit Vreken and Jan van Geen, but despite this, the club stagnated again. A number of coaches followed, but the club did not progress, and promising early starts to seasons often petered out by their ends.

In 1960, president Marcel Saupin selected the young and promising amateur coach José Arribas. He was credited with revolutionising the team&#x27;s game, insisting on team-based, less individual play, and an attack-oriented game. He set up a 4-2-4 instead of the then traditional 4 banks of players. His system showed promise but results were not forthcoming right away: placings read 11th, 6th in his first 2 seasons, and finally 2nd in 1962, having led the second division for the first half of the season. In that time, the club took part in the short-lived Anglo-French-Scottish cup, losing 71 to Liverpool FC.

===Life in the top division - the José Arribas years (1963 to 1976)===
José Arribas and Nantes found their place in the top division right away and finished 8th in their first season. The following season was even better: the club becomes French champions, and their star striker Jacky Simon was the league&#x27;s top goalscorer and became the first Nantes player to earn an international cap. The club also won the French League Cup.

In 1965, the club confirmed its place at the top and won the league again. Best defence (36 goals conceded), best attack (84 goals scored), Philippe Gondet ended the season as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer with 36 goals in 37 games. French success did not lead to European success however, and Nantes lost their first-round European Cup game to Partizan Belgrade, who went on to reach the final. At the end of that season, three Nantes players (De Michèle, Gondet and Budzynski) were part of the French team playing the World Cup in England.

The late 60s and early 70s were not stellar years for the club, typically ending between the 10th and 7th place in the league. They made the French Cup final in 1970 but were routed by Saint-Etienne 5–0. Coach José Arribas&#x27;s place was not under threat however, being very popular with players and fans alike. In parallel, the club worked hard behind the scene to modernise its structures and to develop its recruitment and player academy. Ex-players Jean-Claude Suaudeau and Robert Budzynski joined the coaching and recruitment team, and were tasked with deploying the club&#x27;s playing philosophy at all levels of the club&#x27;s teams. Young players such as Patrice Rio, allied with experienced Argentinians Ángel Marcos and Hugo Bargas, as well as Bayern Munich star Erich Maas enabled the club to turn its fortunes around and win the league in 1973. They also made the French Cup final but lost to Lyon.

The club was unable to break its European jinx: Danish amateur club Vejle eliminated Nantes in the first round of the European Cup. French league results were good, except the recurring disappointing European results of high-flying club Saint-Etienne. By 1976, the club and José Arribas finally parted ways after 13 years.

===Jean Vincent and Jean-Claude Suaudeau (1976 to 1988)===

New coach Jean Vincent was tasked with bringing more success in both domestic and European cups. He started by shuffling the players, putting aside a few stars and starting young academy players such as Loic Amisse, Eric Pécout and Bruno Baronchelli. Still using a very watchable system of play, the team won the league in 1977, for the fourth successive time in its history. In 1978, the team finished followed Monaco but European disappointments continued. That year, the club opened its state-of-the-art training complex (since renamed José Arribas Sporting Centre), the most advanced in France at the time.

In 1979, when Jean-Claude Suaudeau was made assistant manager, this promotion saw the club thrive, winning the French Cup, its first although finishing 2nd in the league. And finally in Europe, the club enjoyed some success, reaching the semi-finals of the Cup Winners Cup competition where they lost to Spanish club Valencia. With Argentinian star player Enzo Trossero, and young up-and-coming academy players José Touré and William Ayache, the club maintained 92 games unbeaten at home.

Jean Vincent left the club in 1981, struggling to fit his new star striker, Yugoslav Vahid Halilhodzic, into the Nantes system of play. Suaudeau took the reins by himself. He benefited from a star-studded defense, with French international goalkeeper Jean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes, centre-backs Patrice Rio and Maxime Bossis, and full backs Michel Bibard, Thierry Tusseau and William Ayache; Bruno Baronchelli still pulls the strings in midfield, helped by academy youngster Seth Adonkor protecting the defence; winger Loic Amisse enjoyed a purple patch in his twilight years; strikers José Touré (nicknamed &#x27;the Brazilian&#x27;) and particularly Vahid Halilhodzic enjoyed a great partnership. In their new La Beaujoire stadium, built for the 1984 Euro competition, Nantes won the title in 1983, and missed out on the double when they lost the French Cup final to Paris Saint-Germain.

Several other French clubs then increased their budgets significantly, and Nantes could not compete. The club lost Thierry Tusseau to Bordeaux, William Ayache to PSG and Maxime Bossis to Matra Racing. Nantes were still among the premier clubs in France, attracting players such as Jorge Burruchaga (World Cup winner with Argentina in 1986), and managed to finish sixth in 1984, second in 1985 and second again in 1986. Other expensive recruits such as Maurice Johnston and Eddie Vercauteren did not gel and the results gradually declined. The constant influx of talented academy players such as Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly was not quite enough to compensate the departures and progress made by other clubs. The club finished 12th in 1987 and tenth in 1988.

===Crisis and renaissance (1988 to 2004)===
Suaudeau was then let go and Miroslav Blažević took his place. The club however experienced financial difficulties (and was even nearly demoted in 1992), and had to rely almost exclusively on its young academy players to survive in the top division. Eventually, Nantes became a &quot;feeder club&quot;, selling its best young players to richer clubs: Deschamps and Yvon Le Roux to Marseille, Michel Der Zakarian to Montpellier, Antoine Kombouaré to Toulon and Vincent Bracigliano to Nîmes.

In July 1991, the club re-appointed Suaudeau, and in July 1992, after spending a fortnight in the second division due to an administrative decision by the &quot;DNCG&quot; (French Football&#x27;s financial regulator), FC Nantes was renamed FC Nantes Atlantique, and was able to take its place in the first division back. Working closely with youth coach Raynald Denoueix, Suaudeau reinstated the &quot;Nantes way of play&quot; and, despite Marcel Desailly&#x27;s departure to Marseille, stabilised the team. Soon the club could again show its trademark quick game with instant passing. The academy provided players who could mix the physical with the technical, particularly those such as Christian Karembeu, Patrice Loko, Japhet N&#x27;Doram and Nicolas Ouédec. Midfield maestros Claude Makélélé and Reynald Pedros delighted crowds all over France. The team reached the French Cup final in 1993 (losing to PSG) before winning the French league in 1995. Nantes registered ten 3–0 wins at home that season. In 1995–96 Nantes reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, coming close to eliminating Juventus after a superb performance in the return leg at home.

However, Nantes continued to sell its best players, with Karembeu and Loko sold in 1995 and Ouédec, N&#x27;Doram, Makélélé, Benoît Cauet and goalkeeper David Marraud sold in the following two years. In 1997, frustrated by this, Suaudeau left the club and Denoueix took charge. The academy came to the rescue once again, and nimble, technical, players such as Stéphane Ziani, Olivier Monterrubio, Eric Carrière, Mickaël Landreau and Frédéric Da Rocha enabled the club to win two French Cups in a row (1999 and 2000) before winning the league in 2001. Denoueix&#x27;s departure for Real Sociedad impacted the club somewhat, but Nantes still managed a French Cup semi-final, a League Cup final and 6th place in the league in 2004 under Ángel Marcos.

===Down and out (2005 to 2013)===
Nantes finished last in the league in 2007 and were relegated, triggering a pitch invasion and protests by fans. 44 consecutive seasons in the top division came to an end.

In the summer of 2007 summer the club was sold to businessman Waldemar Kita. While the club had only five managers between 1960 and 2000, in the decade 2000 to 2010, ten were employed and sacked. The club was promoted back to the top division in 2008, only to be relegated again the next season. Nantes then finished in 15th place in Ligue 2 under the management of three different coaches.

===Back to the top (2013 to present)===

Ex-player Michel Der Zakarian took the helm in 2012, leading the club to promotion from the 2012–13 Ligue 2, with 20 goals from Filip Đorđević. The team made it to the semi-finals of the 2013–14 Coupe de la Ligue, losing 2–1 at home to PSG. In April 2016, after a tense relationship, club president Waldemar Kita announced that Der Zakarian would leave at the end of the season.

René Girard was sacked after 15 games with Nantes second from bottom in December 2016, and was replaced by Sérgio Conceição. He took the team to seventh place, but left in June 2017 for Porto to be closer to his family.

Following brief spells by Claudio Ranieri and Miguel Cardoso, former Nantes player Vahid Halilhodžić was hired in October 2018. The following January, the club transferred Argentine striker Emiliano Sala to Premier League club Cardiff City for £15 million; he died in a light aircraft crash in the English Channel. The club reached the semi-finals of the 2018–19 Coupe de France, losing 3–0 to PSG.

After a year with Christian Gourcuff in charge and seven games under former France national team manager Raymond Domenech, 18th-placed Nantes hired Antoine Kombouaré on 10 February 2021. He finished the season in that position, before winning the play-off against Toulouse to stay up. On 7 May 2022, Nantes won their fourth Coupe de France with a 1–0 win over Nice, their first honour since 2001; Ludovic Blas scored the only goal from the penalty spot.
In the 2022–23 Ligue 1 season, Nantes avoided relegation on the final day of the campaign defeating Angers 1–0 to leapfrog Auxerre who went down instead.
In the 2023–24 Ligue 1 season, Nantes finished 14th on the table, just four points above the relegation zone.

==Stadiums==

FC Nantes played at Stade Marcel Saupin from 1937 to 1984. They moved to their current home ground Stade de la Beaujoire in 1984; the stadium has a capacity of 35,322.
A new stadium dubbed &#x27;YelloPark&#x27; was expected to be built as Nantes&#x27; home ground in 2022, but the project was abandoned on 26 February 2019 following refusal by the Nantes Metropolitan Council to sell lands needed for development of the site.

<text>Oenopides is a lunar impact crater that is located near the northwestern limb of the Moon, and so appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. This formation lies due south of the prominent crater Pythagoras, and is attached to the southwest rim of Babbage E. The southwest rim of Oenopides is part of the northern edge of Oceanus Procellarum. To the south is Markov.

This formation is an old crater that has been heavily eroded by subsequent impacts, leaving a low outer rim that is generally hilly and contains a few clefts. There is a gap in the southeastern rim, and the level interior is attached to the lunar mare to the south. There are several small craters lying near the eastern rim, and the remainder of the floor is marked by tiny craterlets.

To the southwest is the remnant of Oenopides R, of which only parts of the rim are still protruding above the surface and the southern rim is completely missing.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Oenopides.

<text>Football Club des Girondins de Bordeaux (), commonly referred to as Girondins de Bordeaux () or simply Bordeaux, is a French football club based in the city of Bordeaux in Gironde, Nouvelle-Aquitaine. It competes in the Championnat National 2, the fourth tier of football in France, after an administrative double relegation in 2024.

Bordeaux was founded on 1 October 1881 as a multi-sports club and it is one of the most successful football clubs in France. The club has won six Division 1/Ligue 1 titles, the last in 2009. Bordeaux have also won four Coupe de France titles, three Coupe de la Ligue titles, and three Trophée des champions titles as well. In international competitions Bordeaux has reached the UEFA Cup final in 1996 and the Latin Cup final in 1950. From a year to its inception, the club&#x27;s stadium was the Stade Chaban-Delmas, from 2015, Bordeaux&#x27;s home ground is the Matmut Atlantique.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
The club took its name &quot;Girondins&quot; from the demonym for people from the region, and was founded on 1 October 1881 as a gymnastics and shooting club. The club, chaired by André Chavois, later added sports such as rowing, equestrian, and swimming, among others. It was not until 1910 when football was officially introduced to the club following strong urging from several members within the club, most notably club president Raymond Brard, though it was only available on a basis. The experiment with football lasted only a year before returning almost a decade later in 1919. The club contested its first official match in 1920 defeating Section Burdigalienne 12–0.

Bordeaux achieved professional status in football on 2 July 1936, partly due to the club&#x27;s merger with fellow &quot;Bordelais&quot; outfit Girondins Guyenne Sport, which resulted in the club that exists today. Bordeaux&#x27;s rise to professionalism came about alongside the French Football Federation&#x27;s plea to increase professionalism in French football, which prior to 1932, had been non-existent. The club was inserted into the second division of French football and made its debut appearance during the 1937–38 season. The club&#x27;s first manager was Spaniard Benito Díaz. Diaz brought fellow Spanish players Santiago Urtizberea and Jaime Mancisidor to the team with the latter serving as captain. The club&#x27;s most prominent Frenchmen on the team were homegrown attacker Henri Arnaudeau and goalkeeper André Gérard. Bordeaux played its first official match on 23 May 1937 defeating Rhône-Alpes-based FC Scionzier 2–1 at the Stade de Colombes. The club&#x27;s first ever league match was contested on 22 August losing away to Toulouse 3–2. Bordeaux recorded its first league win against Nîmes. Unfortunately for the club, the team finished 6th in the Southern region of the division. Bordeaux&#x27;s disappointing finish inserted the club into the relegation playoff portion of the league where the team finished a respectable 3rd. A year later, Bordeaux moved into a new home, the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which had previously been known as, simply Parc Lescure. The facility was built specifically for the 1938 FIFA World Cup and, following the competition&#x27;s completion, was designated to Bordeaux. The club had formerly played its home matches at the Stade Galin, which today is used as a training ground.

=== Success and stability ===

On 15 October 1940, Bordeaux merged with local club AS Port and took on one of the club&#x27;s most prestigious traditions, the scapular. Bordeaux ASP, which the club was now known, adorned the scapular during its run to the 1941 edition of the Coupe de France final. The match, played in occupied France at the Stade Municipal in Saint-Ouen, saw Bordeaux defeat SC Fives 2–0 with Urtizberea netting both goals. The Coupe de France triumph was the club&#x27;s first major honour. Following the liberation of France, Bordeaux returned to league play and earned promotion to the first division following its 2nd-place finish during the 1948–49 season. After the season, André Gérard, now manager of the club, signed Dutchman Bertus de Harder. Led by the three-headed monster of De Harder, Édouard Kargu, and Camille Libar, Bordeaux captured its first-ever league championship, in just the club&#x27;s first season in the first division, winning by six points over second place Lille. The league success led to Bordeaux being selected to participate in the second edition of the Latin Cup. In the competition, Bordeaux reached the final drawing 3–3 with Portuguese outfit Benfica. The draw forced a second match with Benfica claiming victory following an extra time goal after over two hours and 25 minutes of play.

Bordeaux maintained its title-winning aspirations finishing runners-up to Nice two seasons after winning its first title. The club also performed well in cup competitions reaching the Coupe de France final in 1952 and 1955. In 1952, Bordeaux suffered defeat to the team it finished runner-up to the same year, Nice, following a thrilling match in which eight goals were scored with five of them coming in the first 40 minutes. Bordeaux drew the match at 3–3 following a 55th-minute goal from Henri Baillot, but Nice countered minutes later with two goals in a span of four minutes to go up 5–3, which was the final result. In 1955, Bordeaux were trounced 5–2 by Lille who went up 4–0 within 35 minutes. The resulting struggles in the cup competitions led to struggles domestically with the club suffering relegation in the 1955–56 season. The club returned to the first division for the 1959–60 season, but failed to make an impact falling back to Division 2 after finishing last in the standings with 21 points.

Bordeaux returned to its former selves in the 1960s under new manager and former player Salvador Artigas. Under the helm of Artigas, Bordeaux returned to the first division and finished in a respectable fourth place for the 1962–63 season. The following season, Bordeaux returned to the Coupe de France final where the club faced off against Lyon. Bordeaux, once again, were defeated 2–0 courtesy of two goals from the Argentine Nestor Combin. The club&#x27;s runner-up finish resulted in the team qualifying for the 1964–65 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The appearance was brief with the club losing 4–3 on aggregate to German club Borussia Dortmund. Four seasons later, Bordeaux again reached the final of the Coupe de France, the club&#x27;s seventh appearance overall. The team faced Saint-Étienne and, again failed to match the achievement reached in 1941 losing 2–1. The following season, Bordeaux earned another appearance in the final, but again, failed to win the trophy losing 2–0 to Marseille. The team suffered an extreme decline during the 1970s, despite the arrival of Alain Giresse. The club played under seven different managers during the decade and consistently finished at the bottom half of the table. In 1979, the club was sold to the influential and ambitious real estate mogul Claude Bez, who positioned himself as president of the club. In the summer of 1983, Girondins de Bordeaux organised a centenary tournament; Bordeaux won a 2–0 victory over Barcelona in the semi-finals of this tournament, and in the final, the club was defeated by VfB Stuttgart.

=== Return to prominence in the 1980s ===
Under the helm of Claude Bez, who injected millions into the club, Bordeaux flourished winning three league championships, two Coupe de France titles, and also performed well in European competitions, most notably reaching the European Cup semi-final in 1985. During Bez&#x27;s run presiding over the team, he recruited several French internationals such as Bernard Lacombe, Jean Tigana, René Girard, Jean-Christophe Thouvenel, and Thierry Tusseau. Bez also brought in established manager Aimé Jacquet. Led by 1970s mainstays Giresse and Gernot Rohr, Bordeaux captured its first league championship since 1950 in the 1983–84 season finishing equal on points with Monaco, however, due to having a better goal difference, Bordeaux were declared champions. The next season, Bordeaux again won the league claiming the title by four points over second place Nantes. In Europe, Bordeaux played in the 1984–85 European Cup and reached the semi-finals, defeating Spanish club Athletic Bilbao, Romanian club Dinamo București, and Soviet outfit Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk before losing to Italian club Juventus. In the Coupe de France, Bordeaux finally achieved cup glory defeating Marseille 2–1 in the 1986 edition of the final with Tigana and Giresse recording both goals. The Coupe de France trophy was the club&#x27;s first since 1941 after eight agonising attempts in finals. The following year the club responded by winning the trophy again; in a re-match with Marseille, Bordeaux won its second consecutive cup courtesy of goals from Philippe Fargeon and Zlatko Vujović. Bordeaux then capped off the 1986–87 Division 1 season by winning its fourth league title and achieving the double as well.

Bordeaux ended the decade with a 13th place finish in their 1989 league campaign.

===Rising from the ashes in the 1990s===
Due to administrative problems, the club was relegated just two years thereafter. In 1992, however, &quot;Les Girondins&quot; won that year&#x27;s Division 2 title, thus being elevated to the top tier of French football. In the emergence of young and exciting players such as playmaker Zinedine Zidane, striker Christophe Dugarry and left back Bixente Lizarazu, the club ascended even higher to win the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1995. With this talented trio, the club defeated FC Rotor Volgograd (the 1995 King&#x27;s Cup Winner), Real Betis, Milan and Slavia Prague in the second, third, quarter- and semi-finals respectively to reach the 1996 UEFA Cup final where they were beaten by Bayern Munich 5–1 on aggregate. Bordeaux witnessed further glory only three years later, winning their fifth French league title in the 1998–99 season with winger Sylvain Wiltord winning the Golden Boot of that season with 22 goals.

===Into the 2000s===
During the 1999–2000 season, the club played in the new UEFA Champions League for the first time. In two seasons time Bordeaux won another piece of silverware, beating Lorient 3–0 in the 2002 Coupe de la Ligue final. &quot;Le club au scapulaire&quot; then two seasons later defeated Club Brugge 4–1 on aggregate in the fourth round to reach the 2004 UEFA Cup quarter-finals, where the club fell to eventual winners Valencia. Bordeaux got to another final in 2007 where there were eventually victorious in winning the Coupe de la Ligue of that year. Bordeaux then achieved further honours in winning the Ligue 1 and Coupe de la Ligue titles of the 2008–09 French footballing season thus achieving the first ever double in the club&#x27;s history. In 2013, Bordeaux won the Coupe de France defeating Evian 3–2 in the final. In the 2013–14 Ligue 1 season, Bordeaux finished 7th in the table. In 2015, Bordeaux appointed Willy Sagnol but in 2016 Sagnol was terminated after only winning one match in the first eight games of the season and was replaced by Ulrich Rame. On 27 May 2016, Rame was replaced by Jocelyn Gourvennec. On 20 January 2018, Gourvennec was fired and was replaced by Gus Poyet. Poyet guided Bordeaux to a 6th-placed finish at the end of the season.

In July 2018, General American Capital Partners&#x27;s CEO Joseph DaGrosa pursued the purchase of the French professional football team for €70 million after 19 years of M6&#x27;s ownership. 

On 18 August 2018, Poyet was suspended by Bordeaux after labelling the situation as &quot;embarrassing&quot; when Gaëtan Laborde was sold to Montpellier without his knowledge or consent. On 5 September 2018, Ricardo Gomes was appointed as &quot;General Manager&quot; — he did not possess the necessary coaching badges to be officially appointed the first-team coach.

The purchase of the club by General American Capital Partners would be completed in November 2018, before they sold their stake to majority shareholder King Street Capital in December 2019.

===COVID-19 financial crisis===
On 23 April 2021, the club cited a decreased revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, there was the loss of income of Mediapro, the TV rights holder who went bankrupt after missed payments the year prior. The club was placed in administration when the American owners, King Street stated they would no longer support the club financially. On 22 June 2021, Girondins de Bordeaux announced that Gérard López acquired the club. 

For the first time since the 1990–91 season, Bordeaux finished last in the 2021–22 Ligue 1 season and were relegated to the Ligue 2. That was when the club were administratively relegated as a consequence of financial difficulties. On 14 June 2022, the DNCG administratively relegated Bordeaux to the Championnat National due to financial issues. The club confirmed it would appeal the decision, citing it as &#x27;brutal&#x27;. On 27 July 2022, Bordeaux won its appeal and was officially reinstated in Ligue 2 for the 2022–23 season.

===Financial administration ===
At the end of the 2023–24 season, Bordeaux was administratively relegated to the Championnat National. Although the club had initially appealed the decision, it later withdrew the appeal.

On 25 July 2024, it was announced that the club informed the French Football Federation that they would officially give up their status as a professional football club, with current player contracts being terminated and the team&#x27;s training centre closing indefinitely. In a press release, the club stated that they would still be promoting their youth academies, and hoping they could play in the Championnat National next season and get back to Ligue 1 with &quot;sound finances and a renewed ambition&quot;. Then, on 1 August 2024, due to bankruptcy, Bordeaux was forcibly relegated to the Championnat National 2 and put into financial administration by the French football controlling body, the National Directorate of Management Control/DNCG ().

==Rivalries==
Bordeaux has two main rivalries, firstly the Derby de la Garonne with Toulouse FC, so named because Bordeaux and Toulouse are the two major clubs that play in cities in south-western France, both of which are on the river Garonne. The consistency and competitiveness of the rivalry developed following Toulouse&#x27;s return to Ligue 1 after being administratively relegated to the Championnat National in 2001. Les Girondins also contest the with their other main rival FC Nantes, with the name stemming from the two cities&#x27; proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The history of this rivalry transcends to over 50 years and 90 derby games have been played between the two clubs altogether. Bordeaux also held a 44-year-old record against another big rival, Marseille. From October 1977 to January 2022, Marseille did not win away at Bordeaux&#x27;s home ground.

==Sponsors==
Since July 2020, the equipment manufacturer of the Girondins de Bordeaux was Adidas. The club&#x27;s main sponsors are the restaurant chain Bistro Régent, the online betting company Betclic and the car dealership SEAT Cupra.

<text>Paneth is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the northwestern limb. It lies just to the north-northeast of the crater Smoluchowski, and to the east-southeast of Boole on the near side.

The rim of Paneth is worn, but only moderately; the edge remains well-defined and marked only by small craters along the northwest and southeast. This formation partly overlies a shallower crater Paneth K along the southeast of the rim. Only a narrow strip of terrain separates Paneth from Smoluchowski, and this ground is marked by an elongated crater and a short rille.

The interior floor has a central peak formation near the midpoint and a pair of small craters along the eastern rim. The inner surface is otherwise relatively flat and marked only by tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Paneth.

<text>Thirteen Ghosts (also known as 13 Ghosts and stylized as THIR13EN Ghosts) is a 2001 supernatural horror film directed by Steve Beck in his directorial debut. A remake of the 1960 film &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; by William Castle, the film stars Tony Shalhoub, Embeth Davidtz, Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts, Rah Digga, and F. Murray Abraham.

Released theatrically on October 26, 2001, the film grossed $68 million at the box office on a budget of $42 million and received generally negative reviews upon release.

== Plot ==
Ghost hunter Cyrus Kriticos and his psychic assistant Dennis Rafkin lead a team on a mission to capture a spirit called the Juggernaut. Several men, including Cyrus, are killed while the team can catch the ghost. Cyrus&#x27;s nephew Arthur, a widower, is informed by Cyrus&#x27;s estate lawyer, Ben Moss, that he has inherited Cyrus&#x27; mansion. Financially insecure, Arthur decides to move there with his two children, Kathy and Bobby, and their nanny, Maggie.

Dennis meets the family as they tour the mansion. The residence is made entirely of glass sheets inscribed with Latin phrases, which Dennis recognizes as barrier spells. He discovers that the 12 angry ghosts he and Cyrus captured are imprisoned in the house, held captive by the spells. As he warns Arthur, Moss unwittingly triggers a mechanism that seals the house and releases the ghosts. Moss dies when a set of sliding doors cut him in half. Bobby sees several of the ghosts, including the Withered Lover – his mother, Jean, who had died of injuries sustained in a house fire. He is knocked unconscious and dragged away.

Dennis uses a pair of spectral glasses that allow the wearer to see the supernatural realm to avoid the ghosts. The Jackal, one of the most dangerous ghosts, attacks Kathy and Arthur, but they are saved by Kalina Oretzia, a spirit liberator attempting to free the ghosts. Kathy disappears. The four adults gather in the library, where Arthur learns that Jean&#x27;s ghost is also in the house. Kalina explains that the house is a machine powered by captive ghosts, allowing its users to see the past, present, and future. The only way to shut it down is by creating a 13th ghost from a sacrifice of love. Arthur realizes that he must become that ghost to save his children.

Armed with the spectral glasses, Arthur and Dennis enter the basement to find the children. Dennis barricades Arthur behind a glass sheet for his protection. Dennis is beaten to death by the Hammer and the Juggernaut, two other dangerous ghosts. It is revealed that Cyrus faked his death to lure Arthur to the house; Kalina is his partner and lover, revealed when she knocks Maggie unconscious with a large book and promptly kisses Cyrus upon his arrival. Cyrus has orchestrated the abduction of Kathy and Bobby so that Arthur will become the 13th ghost, which will not stop the machine as Kalina had claimed but trigger its activation. Cyrus kills Kalina, who objected to Cyrus putting the children in danger and summons the ghosts to activate the machine.

Arthur witnesses all 12 ghosts in the main hall orbiting a clockwork device of rotating metal rings, with his children at the center. He fights Cyrus while Maggie disrupts the machine&#x27;s controls, releasing the ghosts from its power and causing the machine to go haywire. The ghosts hurl Cyrus into the moving rings, slicing him to pieces. With the encouragement of Dennis&#x27; ghost, Arthur jumps through the machine safely to protect his children. The house&#x27;s walls shatter as the malfunctioning machine rips itself apart, freeing the ghosts. Jean&#x27;s ghost tells them she loves them before she disappears.

As the family departs, Maggie angrily declares she is quitting as their nanny.

The film was released on VHS and DVD on April 2, 2002. The film initially debuted on the Blu-ray format on October 19, 2010 in a double feature with &quot;House of Wax&quot; (2005).

A special collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray was released by Shout Factory under their Scream Factory label on July 28, 2020. This new release features brand new interviews with the cast and crew, plus a brand new audio commentary with director Steve Beck.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
In the US, the film opened ranking 2nd behind &quot;K-PAX&quot;, making $15,165,355. It spent 10 weeks in the US box office, eventually making $41,867,960 domestically, and $68,467,960 worldwide.

=== Critical reception ===
Reviews for &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot; were mostly negative. Praise was directed toward the production design but the film was criticized for its lack of scares and a number of strobe effects throughout that could induce seizures. It holds an approval rating of 19% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 96 reviews with an average rating of 3.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The production design is first rate, but &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; is distinctly lacking in scares.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100, based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; rated the film two out of four stars, panning the film&#x27;s lack of scares, and predictable plot twists. However, Gonzalez commended the art direction, while also stating it was underutilized. 
Roger Ebert praised the production values saying, &quot;The production is first-rate...The physical look of the picture is splendid.&quot; However, he criticized the story, lack of interesting characters, loud soundtrack, and poor editing. In 2005 Ebert included it on his list of &quot;Most Hated&quot; films.
In the years since its release and disappointing box office performance, the film has gathered a prominent cult following, finding further success and more positive reception. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the film &quot;what we&#x27;re left with after the scares is just plain dumb.&quot;

==Future==
In August 2023, Dark Castle Entertainment announced that they were planning to make a &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot; series.

<doc id="1135297" wikidata="Q541412" url="?curid=1135297" title="13 Ghosts">
<text>13 Ghosts is a 1960 American supernatural horror film produced and directed by William Castle, written by Robb White and starring Rosemary DeCamp, Margaret Hamilton, Charles Herbert, Martin Milner, Jo Morrow, John van Dreelen, and Donald Woods.

&quot;13 Ghosts&quot; was released in 1960 as a double bill with &quot;12 to the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Electronic Monster&quot; or &quot;Battle in Outer Space&quot;, depending on the film market.

==Plot==
The occultist Dr. Plato Zorba bequeaths a large house to his impoverished nephew Cyrus. Along with his wife Hilda, teen daughter Medea and adolescent son, Buck, Cyrus is informed by lawyer Ben Rush that the house comes with ghosts that Dr. Zorba has collected from around the world. The will stipulates that the family must stay in the house and cannot sell it, or it will be turned over to the state. The family is shocked to find that the house is really haunted by 12 ghosts. The furnished mansion also comes with a creepy housekeeper, Elaine, who conducts seances, and a hidden fortune concealed somewhere on the property. The spirits include a wailing lady, clutching hands, a fiery skeleton, an Italian chef continuously murdering his wife and her lover in the kitchen, a hanging lady, an executioner holding a severed head, a fully grown lion with its headless tamer, a floating head and a ghost of Zorba himself, all held captive in the eerie house and looking for an unlucky 13th ghost to free them. Dr. Zorba also leaves a set of special goggles, the only way of seeing the ghosts. A Ouija board warns the family that a death will occur in the house.

Rush, the estate executor, knows Zorba&#x27;s fortune is hidden somewhere in the house, having unsuccessfully searched for it previously. When two $100 bills fall loose after Buck slides down the stairs, Rush tricks Buck into secretly searching for the money. After Buck finds the cash under the stairs, Rush carries the sleeping boy out of his room and attempts to murder him in the same way that he killed Zorba: using a four-poster bed equipped with a descending canopy that fatally suffocates people.

Zorba&#x27;s ghost appears, killing Rush by driving the terrified Rush under the canopy as Buck awakens and escapes. Rush has become the 13th ghost. The next morning, Cyrus and his family count the recovered money and decide to stay. Elaine says the ghosts have left but predicts they will return, much to Buck&#x27;s delight. Unseen by the family, an unseen force blows the special glasses into smithereens. Elaine gets a broom and permits herself a small enigmatic smile.

==Release and reception==

As with several of his more famous productions, producer William Castle used a gimmick to promote &quot;13 Ghosts&quot;, as audience members were given the choice to see the ghosts. In theaters, most scenes were in black-and-white, but scenes involving ghosts were shown in a process dubbed &quot;Illusion-O&quot;. The filmed elements of the actors and the sets – everything except the ghosts – had a blue filter applied to the footage, while the ghost elements had a red filter and were superimposed over the frame. Audiences received viewing glasses with red and blue cellophane filters. Unlike with early 3D glasses having one eye red and the other cyan or blue, the Illusion-O device required viewers to look through a single color with both eyes. Looking through the red filter intensified the images of the ghosts, while the blue filter &quot;removed&quot; them.

Television and home video releases are edited to simulate the effect without the need for special glasses.

Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a simple, old-fashioned haunted house yarn&quot; that &quot;would be a lot better off without this gimmick.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;The idea is sound and exploitable, but the execution doesn&#x27;t fully come off,&quot; explaining the ghosts &quot;lack personality and aren&#x27;t frightening, so that there isn&#x27;t sufficient tension in the sequences during which the &#x27;ghost viewer&#x27; comes into play.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;a workmanlike but not very frightening horror film ... the ghosts, which are a dull red colour, are far less effective when witnessed than when their presence is merely suggested, especially when their viewability depends on a process as unremarkable as Illusion-O.&quot;

==Remake==
The film was remade in 2001 as &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot;, directed by Steve Beck. As with the original, the film was distributed by Columbia Pictures, except in the United States and Canada, where it was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.

<text>Protagoras is a lunar impact crater that is located on the Mare Frigoris in the northern part of the Moon. To the north-northwest is the slightly larger crater Archytas, and to the southeast is the prominent Aristoteles.

The rim of Protagoras is circular and rises above the surrounding flat terrain, although the rim dips down along the southwestern edge. The interior floor contains a few light markings but no formations of interest. There is an area of rough terrain just to the east of this crater, but the surroundings are otherwise level with only a few small craters in the vicinity.

The crater is named for the Greek sophist Protagoras of Abdera.

Protagoras is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint closest to Protagoras.

<text>Spa Road railway station in Bermondsey, south-east London, was the original terminus of the capital&#x27;s first railway, the London and Greenwich Railway (L&amp;GR). It was located on and takes its name from Spa Road.

It was also the first railway terminus in what is now Greater London. First opened in 1836, the station went through several changes of ownership, was rebuilt several times, changed its name and was relocated a couple of hundred yards away from its original site before it closed in 1915 due to cost-saving measures during the First World War. The disused station building is today part of a light industrial estate. A number of elements of the original station – including the ticket office and remnants of the platforms – are still visible.

== History ==

=== First station (1836–1838) ===

In 1833 an Act of Parliament granted the L&amp;GR the rights to build a viaduct from the south end of London Bridge to Greenwich and to run trains along it. However, the line was partially opened to the public well before its full length had been completed in order to maximise revenue income as soon as possible. Other companies were in the process of building their own railway lines and the L&amp;GR wished to gain the commercial advantage of being the first to open for business. Another consideration was the company&#x27;s stock price, which stood high at the end of 1835 but was at risk of falling if the line was not soon opened.

The board decided to open a stretch from Spa Road to , which served the district of Deptford. The first train left Deptford railway station for Spa Road at 8 am on 8 February 1836. Trains ran hourly on the half-hour from Spa Road, from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm, with a fare to Deptford costing 6&quot;d&quot;. There were no services after dark, as there were no signals on the line and it was not illuminated.
Spa Road station was within the parish of Bermondsey, which was then an industrial and working class area. From there the line crossed over marshes and market gardens to reach Deptford and Greenwich. The station itself was very basic. It was squeezed into a narrow space on a two-track viaduct with no room for buildings of any sort. The company did not even refer to it as a station but as a &quot;stopping place.&quot; The platforms were accessed via wooden staircases on the outside of the viaduct, the one on the south side having a small wooden hut at the bottom for issuing tickets. If the platform was full, passengers were supposed to queue on the steps to wait for the trains. In practice, though, they often queued on the track itself. The company had not originally intended to provide platforms at all and had fitted its carriages with steps to allow passengers to board from track level, but found that low platforms were more convenient. The Commissioner of Pavements required the L&amp;GR to maintain the staircases and to provide at least two services a day from the station.
Perhaps not surprisingly given the station&#x27;s physical limitations, only a month after it was opened there was a fatal accident when passenger Daniel Holmes was run over by a train. The other passengers had been waiting with others on the track when the Deptford train arrived. They climbed up on to the platform but Holmes remained on the track. The engine driver, Thomas Millender, was distracted by Holmes and collided with the waiting southbound train. A number of passengers who had already boarded the southbound train were injured and Holmes was killed instantly when Millender&#x27;s runaway engine struck him. The duty policeman only just escaped also being struck and was dismissed for failing to warn the passengers in time. The accident was witnessed by George Walker, the L&amp;GR&#x27;s Resident Director, who subsequently wrote of the difficulties that his staff experienced in keeping people off the tracks.

The L&amp;GR opened the line between London Bridge and Spa Road on 14 December 1836. Usage of Spa Road station dropped significantly after the opening of London Bridge railway station, and drivers began to go straight through without stopping if they had no passenger requests. This changed in March 1838 when the company&#x27;s directors ordered trains to stop at Spa Road hourly throughout the day and reserved half a carriage for passengers to and from the station on Sundays and holidays. They also took steps to improve access to the station. Despite this, it was little used and in late 1838 the L&amp;GR&#x27;s directors decided to close the station. It was boarded up at the end of 1838 and remained out of use until 1842.

=== Second station (1842–1867) ===

In 1840, the L&amp;GR applied to Parliament for powers to widen the viaduct, which was so narrow that the carriages only had a clearance of about between their sides and the parapet wall, and about clearance in the centre. There was no room for buildings of any description anywhere on the line. The company came under pressure to reopen Spa Road station, as competition from the railway had caused the demise of a horse-drawn coach service from Bermondsey to Deptford. It agreed to construct an improved station when the line was widened. This involved moving the access staircase to the north side of the viaduct, building a waiting and booking office room in the arches and constructing a shed over the line. A local contractor, Thomas Jackson, began work on the new station in June 1842 and it opened in September, with the work costing £450 (£33,000 at 2010 prices). The following February another life was lost at Spa Road when a man named Birmingham suffered a fatal injury in the station.

The station was upgraded in August 1843 when signals were erected there, and in May 1844 the platforms were extended. The South Eastern Railway took over the L&amp;GR the following year and rebuilt the whole station again. The reconstruction work, which took place in March 1845, saw the demolition of the stairway and the building of a new internal stair approach from an arch in West Street (now Marine Street) next to the arch occupied by the booking office. The tracks were relaid to make them diverge slightly, providing room for an island platform about wide. A small shelter was constructed there with a roof above track level and projecting about outwards, level with the sides of the carriages. A third-class passenger was killed on 1 April 1850 when he climbed part-way out of his open carriage and hit his head on the shelter&#x27;s projecting roof as his Greenwich-bound train passed through the station. A subsequent Board of Trade enquiry recommended that steps should be taken to ensure that the &quot;unruly class of passengers&quot; found in third class should not have the &quot;power to injure themselves&quot; in future. In the same year, a small shelter for ticket collectors was erected on the Spa Road platform and trains to London Bridge were stopped there to carry out ticket collections before arriving at their destination. This arrangement continued until Charing Cross railway station was opened in 1864.

For some years local children exploited the ticket stops at Spa Road. The ticket collections meant that up trains had to stand there for some considerable time, close to the parapet wall and perfectly visible from street level. One regular traveller, Alfred Rosling Bennett, later recalled,

=== Third station (1867–1915) ===

In 1867 the station was resited further along the viaduct about to the east, with an entrance accessed via what is now Priter Road. It was renamed as Spa Road &amp; Bermondsey in October 1877 (though a photograph of about 1900 shows that it was still advertised as &quot;Spa Road Station&quot;). When the South Eastern and Chatham Railway was formed in 1899 from the South Eastern Railway and its bitter competitor, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, the station was given another makeover. The current appearance of the station frontage dates from 1900.

On 15 March 1915, the station was closed, along with Southwark Park and Deptford stations, as a wartime economy measure. Only Deptford was subsequently reopened. Spa Road continued to be used by railwaymen until September 1925, when it ceased to be used by the railway.

== Closure ==

By the mid-1980s the old station had fallen into dereliction. It was left empty for many years, and the vacant land around it became a site for fly tipping of waste and rubbish. In 1986, British Rail, the Southwark Environment Trust and the London Borough of Southwark contributed £50,000 to the restoration the station frontage and installing two commemorative plaques. The station arches and the land in front of them were redeveloped into a light industrial estate behind a block of flats, accessed via Priter Road.

Parts of the station still exist; platform remnants are visible from trains travelling between Deptford or New Cross and London Bridge, and can easily be seen in satellite imagery. The frontage of the station is extant and displays the signage of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. The site of the ticket windows is also visible. The disused platforms can still be reached via the old ticket office and have occasionally been used for emergency access. On 8 January 1999, when two commuter trains collided and derailed in the Spa Road Junction rail crash, some passengers had to be evacuated through the old station.

== Spa Terminus ==
Monmouth Coffee Company, Neal&#x27;s Yard Dairy and the property company Matching Green formed Spa Terminus Limited to take a lease on a stretch of railway arches around Spa Road station in Bermondsey to provide accommodation for food manufacturers and wholesalers. Monmouth Coffee Company and Neal&#x27;s Yard Dairy moved their headquarters into arches at Spa Terminus in 2018.

<doc id="1135310" wikidata="Q221525" url="?curid=1135310" title="FC Metz">
<text>Football Club de Metz () is a French association football club based in Metz, Lorraine. The club was formed in 1932 and plays in Ligue 2, the second division in the French football league system, for the 2024–25 season following their relegation from the top flight in the 2023–2024 season. They play their home matches at Stade Saint-Symphorien located within the city. The team is currently managed by Stéphane Le Mignan. Despite never winning the top flight, they have won the Coupe de France twice and the Coupe de la Ligue twice.

==History==
FC Metz was founded in 23 March 1932 by the amalgamation of two amateur athletic clubs, and shortly thereafter became a professional team; it is one of the oldest professional football teams in France. Its roots trace back further, to the &quot;SpVgg Metz&quot; club, formed in 1905 when the city of Metz was part of the German Empire. &quot;SpVgg&quot; played in the tier-one &quot;Westkreis-Liga&quot; for a season in 1913–14, before the outbreak of the First World War stopped all play. Some players of this club were part of the &quot;Cercle Athlétique Messin&quot; in 1919, which went on to become FC Metz in 1932. &quot;Messin&quot; was a leading club in the &quot;Division d&#x27;Honneur – Lorraine&quot;, taking out league titles in 1920, 1921, 1922, 1924, 1926, 1927, 1929 and 1931.

The club played in the French second division north from 1933, winning the league in 1935 and earning promotion to Ligue 1 for the first time. The team became a mid-table side in the first division until the outbreak of the war interfered with play once more. &quot;FCM&quot; did not take part in the top-tier regional competitions in 1939–40.

During World War II, due to the Moselle département being annexed by Germany, the club had to play under the Germanised name of &quot;FV Metz&quot; in the &quot;Gauliga Westmark&quot;. In the three completed seasons of this league from 1941 to 1944, the club finished runners-up each year.

Despite the city of Metz being retaken by allied forces in autumn 1944, the club did not take part in French league football in 1944–45 but returned to Ligue 1 in 1945–46, to come 17th out of 18 clubs. An expansion of the league to 20 clubs meant, the team was not relegated and stayed at the highest level until 1950, when a last place finish ended its Ligue 1 membership. Metz was allowed to stay within Ligue 1 as a special privilege due to its catastrophic situation in the year following the war: the stadium had been damaged, almost beyond repair. The team had to start from scratch once again.

The club rebounded immediately, finishing second in Ligue 2, behind Lyon and returned to the first division. FC Metz made a strong return to this league, finishing fifth in its first season back. After this, the club once more had to battle against relegation season-by-season, finishing second-last in 1958 and having to return to Ligue 2. It took three seasons in this league before it could manage to return to Ligue 1 in 1961, but lasted for only one year in the top flight. FC Metz spent the next five seasons at second division level.

FC Metz ascended to the top level of French football once more in 1967; the team remained in the highest division until they were relegated in 2001, although they bounced back immediately and returned to the Ligue 1 the following year.

After losing the first leg of their 1984–85 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup tie 4–2 to Barcelona at Stade Saint-Symphorien, FC Metz were widely expected to be thrashed at Camp Nou. However, a hat-trick from Yugoslav striker Tony Kurbos gave Les Grenats a shock 4–1 win in the second leg to send the French side through 6–5 on aggregate.

In 1998, the team competed in the qualifications to the UEFA Champions League, but lost in the third round to Finnish team HJK Helsinki. In 2006, FC Metz were relegated from Ligue 1, finishing at the bottom of the table, despite the regular presence of an extremely promising prospect, Miralem Pjanić, who would later be transferred to giants Lyon, for an astonishing fee of €7.5 million. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Metz finished 18th in Ligue 2 and were relegated to the Championnat National, the third tier of French football after a 1–1 draw with Tours at home on 20 May 2012, in very tense circumstances. Metz spent only one season at this level, rebuilding a team with iconic former player Albert Cartier as coach, winning promotion to Ligue 2, and then immediately finishing first and winning promotion to Ligue 1. The team was relegated again to Ligue 2, but won promotion the next season. This time, Metz managed to secure a 14th place finish, ensuring another season in Ligue 1. For the 2017–18 Ligue 1 season, Metz endured a horrid campaign, losing eleven out of their first twelve matches. The club recovered later in the season but finished bottom of the table and were relegated back to Ligue 2.

On 26 April 2019, Metz were promoted back to Ligue 1 at the first time of asking by finishing first in Ligue 2. The promotion was confirmed with a 2–1 victory over Red Star.
In the clubs first season back in the top flight, Metz finished 15th on the table followed by an improved 10th place finish the following season. In the 2021–22 Ligue 1 season, Metz finished 19th and were relegated back to Ligue 2. The club were promoted back to Ligue 1 as Ligue 2 runners-up for the 2022-23 season.

On Pentecost Sunday, May 29, 2023, there was a dispute at a youth football tournament on the field of SV Viktoria Preußen e.V. in the Eckenheim district of Frankfurt am Main between young players from FC Metz and JFC Berlin, in which a 16-year-old Moroccan player from FC Metz killed a 15-year-old German player from JFC Berlin.
On 12 June 2023, LFP Decision that FC Metz secure promotion to Ligue 1 from 2023–24 season after Bordeaux against Rodez has been suspended and return to top flight after one year absence. In the 2023–24 Ligue 1 season, Metz finished in the relegation/promotion playoff spot and faced off against AS Saint-Étienne from Ligue 2. Metz would lose the playoff 4-3 on aggregate and were relegated back to Ligue 2.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Metz&#x27;s biggest rivals are AS Nancy with whom they contest the Lorraine derby. The other major rivals are Racing Strasbourg.

There are currently two ultras groups: &quot;Gradins Populaires Ouest&quot; and &quot;Horda Frénétik&quot; (founded 1997).

FC Metz has fan friendships with Toulouse FC, the German clubs Kaiserslautern and Eintracht Trier and the Italian club Vicenza.

==Stadium==
FC Metz plays its home matches at Stade Saint-Symphorien, which has a capacity of 25,636. Thus, it is the largest venue dedicated to football in Lorraine.

==Crest==
Its official colours are grenat (maroon) and white, from which the team derives its nickname Les Grenats. The team&#x27;s crest features the Lorraine cross, symbolic of the team&#x27;s regional affiliation, and the dragon called the &quot;Graoully&quot;, which in local legend was tamed by Saint Clement of Metz.

==Youth academy==
FC Metz also gained recognition in France and Europe for its successful youth academy, which produced star players including: Rigobert Song, Robert Pires, Louis Saha, Emmanuel Adebayor, Papiss Cissé, Miralem Pjanić, Kalidou Koulibaly, and Sadio Mané. The city&#x27;s proximity to Luxembourg (about 55 km) plays a significant role in the importation of young prospects. The club&#x27;s board has close ties with the Luxembourgish Football Federation. Nicolas &quot;Nico&quot; Braun, the team&#x27;s top all-time goalscorer, as well as Pjanić or more recently Chris Philipps, have played in the G-D&#x27;s amateur leagues before joining &quot;les Grenats&quot;. Despite this, not all Luxembourgers enjoy success with Metz, with Robert &quot;Robby&quot; Langers as the best example.

==FC Metz in European football==

==Honours==
Metz has never won the French championship; its best result was a second-place finish in 1998, behind Lens. The title race lasted until the ultimate fixture, however Metz never recovered from a 0–2 loss against Lens on their home turf. Metz won the Coupe de France twice, in 1984 and 1988, the first of these victories enabled it to qualify for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup where it achieved arguably the team&#x27;s greatest moment, an upset of Barcelona in the first round of the competition in October 1984. It lost 4–2 at home in the first leg but won 4–1 away in the return leg, thus qualifying 6–5 on aggregate, making Metz unique among the French teams who have beaten Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Metz also won the Coupe de la Ligue twice, in 1986 and 1996, and has made a total of ten appearances in European tournaments.

<doc id="1135311" wikidata="Q1759577" url="?curid=1135311" title="Matched filter">
<text>In signal processing, the output of the matched filter is given by correlating a known delayed signal, or &quot;template&quot;, with an unknown signal to detect the presence of the template in the unknown signal. This is equivalent to convolving the unknown signal with a conjugated time-reversed version of the template. The matched filter is the optimal linear filter for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of additive stochastic noise.

Matched filters are commonly used in radar, in which a known signal is sent out, and the reflected signal is examined for common elements of the out-going signal. Pulse compression is an example of matched filtering. It is so called because the impulse response is matched to input pulse signals. Two-dimensional matched filters are commonly used in image processing, e.g., to improve the SNR of X-ray observations. Additional applications of note are in seismology and gravitational-wave astronomy.

Matched filtering is a demodulation technique with LTI (linear time invariant) filters to maximize SNR.
It was originally also known as a &quot;North filter&quot;.

== Derivation ==
=== Derivation via matrix algebra ===

The following section derives the matched filter for a discrete-time system. The derivation for a continuous-time system is similar, with summations replaced with integrals.

The matched filter is the linear filter, formula_1, that maximizes the output signal-to-noise ratio.

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the input as a function of the independent variable formula_4, and formula_5 is the filtered output. Though we most often express filters as the impulse response of convolution systems, as above (see LTI system theory), it is easiest to think of the matched filter in the context of the inner product, which we will see shortly.

We can derive the linear filter that maximizes output signal-to-noise ratio by invoking a geometric argument. The intuition behind the matched filter relies on correlating the received signal (a vector) with a filter (another vector) that is parallel with the signal, maximizing the inner product. This enhances the signal. When we consider the additive stochastic noise, we have the additional challenge of minimizing the output due to noise by choosing a filter that is orthogonal to the noise.

Let us formally define the problem. We seek a filter, formula_1, such that we maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio, where the output is the inner product of the filter and the observed signal formula_7.

Our observed signal consists of the desirable signal formula_8 and additive noise formula_9:

:formula_10

Let us define the auto-correlation matrix of the noise, reminding ourselves that this matrix has Hermitian symmetry, a property that will become useful in the derivation:

:formula_11

where formula_12 denotes the conjugate transpose of formula_9, and formula_14 denotes expectation (note that in case the noise formula_9 has zero-mean, its auto-correlation matrix formula_16 is equal to its covariance matrix).

Let us call our output, formula_17, the inner product of our filter and the observed signal such that

:formula_18

We now define the signal-to-noise ratio, which is our objective function, to be the ratio of the power of the output due to the desired signal to the power of the output due to the noise:

:formula_19

We rewrite the above:

:formula_20

We wish to maximize this quantity by choosing formula_1. Expanding the denominator of our objective function, we have

:formula_22

Now, our formula_23 becomes

:formula_24

We will rewrite this expression with some matrix manipulation. The reason for this seemingly counterproductive measure will become evident shortly. Exploiting the Hermitian symmetry of the auto-correlation matrix formula_16, we can write

:formula_26

We would like to find an upper bound on this expression. To do so, we first recognize a form of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:

:formula_27

which is to say that the square of the inner product of two vectors can only be as large as the product of the individual inner products of the vectors. This concept returns to the intuition behind the matched filter: this upper bound is achieved when the two vectors formula_28 and formula_29 are parallel. We resume our derivation by expressing the upper bound on our formula_23 in light of the geometric inequality above:

:formula_31

Our valiant matrix manipulation has now paid off. We see that the expression for our upper bound can be greatly simplified:

:formula_32

We can achieve this upper bound if we choose,

:formula_33

where formula_34 is an arbitrary real number. To verify this, we plug into our expression for the output formula_23:

:formula_36

Thus, our optimal matched filter is

:formula_37

We often choose to normalize the expected value of the power of the filter output due to the noise to unity. That is, we constrain

:formula_38

This constraint implies a value of formula_34, for which we can solve:

:formula_40

yielding

:formula_41

giving us our normalized filter,

:formula_42

If we care to write the impulse response formula_1 of the filter for the convolution system, it is simply the complex conjugate time reversal of the input formula_8.

Though we have derived the matched filter in discrete time, we can extend the concept to continuous-time systems if we replace formula_16 with the continuous-time autocorrelation function of the noise, assuming a continuous signal formula_46, continuous noise formula_47, and a continuous filter formula_48.

=== Derivation via Lagrangian ===

Alternatively, we may solve for the matched filter by solving our maximization problem with a Lagrangian. Again, the matched filter endeavors to maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio (formula_23) of a filtered deterministic signal in stochastic additive noise. The observed sequence, again, is

:formula_50

with the noise auto-correlation matrix,

:formula_51

The signal-to-noise ratio is

:formula_52

where formula_53 and formula_54.

Evaluating the expression in the numerator, we have

:formula_55

and in the denominator,

:formula_56

The signal-to-noise ratio becomes

:formula_57

If we now constrain the denominator to be 1, the problem of maximizing formula_23 is reduced to maximizing the numerator. We can then formulate the problem using a Lagrange multiplier:

:formula_59
:formula_60
:formula_61
:formula_62

which we recognize as a &quot;generalized eigenvalue problem&quot;

:formula_63

Since formula_64 is of unit rank, it has only one nonzero eigenvalue. It can be shown that this eigenvalue equals

:formula_65

yielding the following optimal matched filter

:formula_66

This is the same result found in the previous subsection.

== Interpretation as a least-squares estimator ==
=== Derivation ===

Matched filtering can also be interpreted as a least-squares estimator for the optimal location and scaling of a given model or template. Once again, let the observed sequence be defined as

:formula_67

where formula_68 is uncorrelated zero mean noise. The signal formula_69 is assumed to be a scaled and shifted version of a known model sequence formula_70:

:formula_71

We want to find optimal estimates formula_72 and formula_73 for the unknown shift formula_74 and scaling formula_75 by minimizing the least-squares residual between the observed sequence formula_76 and a &quot;probing sequence&quot; formula_77:

:formula_78

The appropriate formula_77 will later turn out to be the matched filter, but is as yet unspecified. Expanding formula_76 and the square within the sum yields

:formula_81

The first term in brackets is a constant (since the observed signal is given) and has no influence on the optimal solution. The last term has constant expected value because the noise is uncorrelated and has zero mean. We can therefore drop both terms from the optimization. After reversing the sign, we obtain the equivalent optimization problem

:formula_82

Setting the derivative w.r.t. formula_83 to zero gives an analytic solution for formula_73:

:formula_85

Inserting this into our objective function yields a reduced maximization problem for just formula_72:

:formula_87

The numerator can be upper-bounded by means of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:

:formula_88

The optimization problem assumes its maximum when equality holds in this expression. According to the properties of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, this is only possible when

:formula_89

for arbitrary non-zero constants formula_90 or formula_91, and the optimal solution is obtained at formula_92 as desired. Thus, our &quot;probing sequence&quot; formula_77 must be proportional to the signal model formula_94, and the convenient choice formula_95 yields the matched filter

:formula_96

Note that the filter is the mirrored signal model. This ensures that the operation formula_97 to be applied in order to find the optimum is indeed the convolution between the observed sequence formula_76 and the matched filter formula_99. The filtered sequence assumes its maximum at the position where the observed sequence formula_76 best matches (in a least-squares sense) the signal model formula_70.

=== Implications ===

The matched filter may be derived in a variety of ways, but as a special case of a least-squares procedure it may also be interpreted as a maximum likelihood method in the context of a (coloured) Gaussian noise model and the associated Whittle likelihood.
If the transmitted signal possessed &quot;no&quot; unknown parameters (like time-of-arrival, amplitude...), then the matched filter would, according to the Neyman–Pearson lemma, minimize the error probability. However, since the exact signal generally is determined by unknown parameters that effectively are estimated (or &quot;fitted&quot;) in the filtering process, the matched filter constitutes a &quot;generalized maximum likelihood&quot; (test-) statistic. The filtered time series may then be interpreted as (proportional to) the profile likelihood, the maximized conditional likelihood as a function of the (&quot;arrival&quot;) time parameter.
This implies in particular that the error probability (in the sense of Neyman and Pearson, i.e., concerning maximization of the detection probability for a given false-alarm probability) is not necessarily optimal.
What is commonly referred to as the &quot;Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)&quot;, which is supposed to be maximized by a matched filter, in this context corresponds to formula_102, where formula_103 is the (conditionally) maximized likelihood ratio. 

The construction of the matched filter is based on a &quot;known&quot; noise spectrum. In practice, however, the noise spectrum is usually estimated from data and hence only known up to a limited precision. For the case of an uncertain spectrum, the matched filter may be generalized to a more robust iterative procedure with favourable properties also in non-Gaussian noise.

== Frequency-domain interpretation ==

When viewed in the frequency domain, it is evident that the matched filter applies the greatest weighting to spectral components exhibiting the greatest signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., large weight where noise is relatively low, and vice versa). In general this requires a non-flat frequency response, but the associated &quot;distortion&quot; is no cause for concern in situations such as radar and digital communications, where the original waveform is known and the objective is the detection of this signal against the background noise. On the technical side, the matched filter is a &quot;weighted least-squares&quot; method based on the (heteroscedastic) frequency-domain data (where the &quot;weights&quot; are determined via the noise spectrum, see also previous section), or equivalently, a &quot;least-squares&quot; method applied to the whitened data.

== Examples ==

=== Radar and sonar ===

Matched filters are often used in signal detection. As an example, suppose that we wish to judge the distance of an object by reflecting a signal off it. We may choose to transmit a pure-tone sinusoid at 1 Hz. We assume that our received signal is an attenuated and phase-shifted form of the transmitted signal with added noise.

To judge the distance of the object, we correlate the received signal with a matched filter, which, in the case of white (uncorrelated) noise, is another pure-tone 1-Hz sinusoid. When the output of the matched filter system exceeds a certain threshold, we conclude with high probability that the received signal has been reflected off the object. Using the speed of propagation and the time that we first observe the reflected signal, we can estimate the distance of the object. If we change the shape of the pulse in a specially-designed way, the signal-to-noise ratio and the distance resolution can be even improved after matched filtering: this is a technique known as pulse compression.

Additionally, matched filters can be used in parameter estimation problems (see estimation theory). To return to our previous example, we may desire to estimate the speed of the object, in addition to its position. To exploit the Doppler effect, we would like to estimate the frequency of the received signal. To do so, we may correlate the received signal with several matched filters of sinusoids at varying frequencies. The matched filter with the highest output will reveal, with high probability, the frequency of the reflected signal and help us determine the radial velocity of the object, i.e. the relative speed either directly towards or away from the observer. This method is, in fact, a simple version of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT takes an formula_104-valued complex input and correlates it with formula_104 matched filters, corresponding to complex exponentials at formula_104 different frequencies, to yield formula_104 complex-valued numbers corresponding to the relative amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal components (see Moving target indication).

=== Digital communications ===

The matched filter is also used in communications. In the context of a communication system that sends binary messages from the transmitter to the receiver across a noisy channel, a matched filter can be used to detect the transmitted pulses in the noisy received signal.

Imagine we want to send the sequence &quot;0101100100&quot; coded in non polar non-return-to-zero (NRZ) through a certain channel.

Mathematically, a sequence in NRZ code can be described as a sequence of unit pulses or shifted rect functions, each pulse being weighted by +1 if the bit is &quot;1&quot; and by -1 if the bit is &quot;0&quot;. Formally, the scaling factor for the formula_108 bit is,

:formula_109

We can represent our message, formula_110, as the sum of shifted unit pulses:

:formula_111

where formula_112 is the time length of one bit and formula_113 is the rectangular function.

Thus, the signal to be sent by the transmitter is

If we model our noisy channel as an AWGN channel, white Gaussian noise is added to the signal. At the receiver end, for a Signal-to-noise ratio of 3 dB, this may look like:

A first glance will not reveal the original transmitted sequence. There is a high power of noise relative to the power of the desired signal (i.e., there is a low signal-to-noise ratio). If the receiver were to sample this signal at the correct moments, the resulting binary message could be incorrect.

To increase our signal-to-noise ratio, we pass the received signal through a matched filter. In this case, the filter should be matched to an NRZ pulse (equivalent to a &quot;1&quot; coded in NRZ code). Precisely, the impulse response of the ideal matched filter, assuming white (uncorrelated) noise should be a time-reversed complex-conjugated scaled version of the signal that we are seeking. We choose

:formula_114

In this case, due to symmetry, the time-reversed complex conjugate of formula_48 is in fact formula_48, allowing us to call formula_48 the impulse response of our matched filter convolution system.

After convolving with the correct matched filter, the resulting signal, formula_118 is,

:formula_119

where formula_120 denotes convolution.

Which can now be safely sampled by the receiver at the correct sampling instants, and compared to an appropriate threshold, resulting in a correct interpretation of the binary message.

=== Gravitational-wave astronomy ===

Matched filters play a central role in gravitational-wave astronomy. The first observation of gravitational waves was based on large-scale filtering of each detector&#x27;s output for signals resembling the expected shape, followed by subsequent screening for coincident and coherent triggers between both instruments. False-alarm rates, and with that, the statistical significance of the detection were then assessed using resampling methods. Inference on the astrophysical source parameters was completed using Bayesian methods based on parameterized theoretical models for the signal waveform and (again) on the Whittle likelihood.

=== Seismology ===
Matched filters find use in seismology to detect similar earthquake or other seismic signals, often using multicomponent and/or multichannel empirically determined templates. Matched filtering applications in seismology include the generation of large event catalogues to study earthquake seismicity and volcanic activity, and in the global detection of nuclear explosions.

=== Biology ===
Animals living in relatively static environments would have relatively fixed features of the environment to perceive. This allows the evolution of filters that match the expected signal with the highest signal-to-noise ratio, the matched filter. Sensors that perceive the world &quot;through such a &#x27;matched filter&#x27; severely limits the amount of information the brain can pick up from the outside world, but it frees the brain from the need to perform more intricate computations to extract the information finally needed for fulfilling a particular task.&quot;

<text>George Balcan, (June 29, 1932 – May 4, 2004), born George Adelard Alfred Balcaen, was a Canadian radio broadcaster and artist.

Balcan was one of the most recognizable voices on the airwaves of Montreal for 30 years. Born in Saint Boniface, Manitoba in 1931, Balcan first worked as a sketch artist in the engineering department of the Canadian Pacific Railway in his native province.

Balcan began his broadcast career in 1951, when he was the first announcer to sign on with CKDM, a radio station in his hometown of Dauphin, Manitoba. He was later discovered working at CKOC in Hamilton by H.T. &quot;Mac&quot; McCurdy, who brought Balcan to Montreal in 1963 to serve as the afternoon host at CJAD. He then became the station&#x27;s morning man in 1967. Balcan moved to crosstown competitor CFCF in 1973, where he also served as an on-air host for the television service. He then returned to CJAD as the morning man in 1975, where he remained until his retirement in 1998, the longest ever to hold the position in any Montreal radio station.

He became an accomplished pastel artist and was a member of the Pastel Society of Canada. His works have graced the walls of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. In 1991, he and his family established the George Balcan Bursary at Concordia University and awards given to Fine Arts students pursuing a major in painting and drawing. Balcan worked tirelessly in his community in support of many causes, including the fight against breast cancer and for juvenile diabetes research.

Balcan was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1996. In 2005, he was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. He died on May 4, 2004.

<text>Nathan Phillips Square is an urban plaza in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It forms the forecourt to Toronto City Hall, or &quot;New City Hall&quot;, at the intersection of Queen Street West and Bay Street, and is named after Nathan Phillips, mayor of Toronto from 1955 to 1962. The square was designed by the City Hall&#x27;s architect Viljo Revell and landscape architect Richard Strong. It opened in 1965. The square is the site of concerts, art displays, a weekly farmers&#x27; market, the winter festival of lights, and other public events, including demonstrations. During the winter months, the reflecting pool is converted into an ice rink for ice skating. The square attracts an estimated 1.5 million visitors yearly. With an area of , it is Canada&#x27;s largest city square.

Nathan Phillips Square is used regularly for art exhibits, concerts, rallies and other ceremonies. Annual events include a New Year&#x27;s Eve Party and the Cavalcade of Lights Festival lighting of the official Christmas tree. The annual Nuit Blanche art festival sets up art exhibits in the square, and has also utilized the parking garage located underneath the square.

==Features==
The square is rectangular in shape, with the edge of the city hall meeting the square on an angle on the north side. The main portion of the square is paved with two sizes of reinforced concrete slabs. The square has a reflecting pool, a peace garden, a permanent stage and several sculptures, including &quot;Three Way Piece No.2: Archer&quot; by Henry Moore. Around the remaining perimeter of the square runs an elevated concrete walkway. Outside the walkway are treed lawns dotted with various other memorials and monuments, such as Oscar Nemon&#x27;s statue of Sir Winston Churchill (c. 1977), and a Roman column. Beneath the square is one of the world&#x27;s largest underground parking garages. In 2012, illuminated &quot;disappearing&quot; fountains were installed among the slabs, used for decoration and cooling. The square is property of the City of Toronto. Smoking is prohibited in the entire square.

===Elevated walkway===

The elevated concrete walkway connects to the podium of the City Hall at the height of its roof and extends around the perimeter of the square. Staircases connect the walkway to the floor of the square in several locations. On the south side, the walkway extends across Queen Street to the Sheraton Hotel. On the west side, the walkway is connected to the back of the permanent stage, which also serves as a grand staircase. The walkway is closed during winter months.

===Peace Garden===
The Peace Garden was created as a memorial to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the &quot;commitment of Torontonians to the principle of world peace.&quot; The sundial at the south end of the garden pre-dates the peace memorial; inscribed with the words &quot;In appreciation of the opportunity to serve,&quot; it was originally installed in 1969, designed by G.R. Johnson (in consultation with H.H. Rogers and John C. Parkin), and presented by Nathan Phillips to the residents of Toronto. Fifteen years later, during the city&#x27;s sesquicentennial, then Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau turned the first sod for the Peace Garden, which was to sit immediately north of, but also incorporate, the pre-existing sundial. 

The garden consists of a pavilion, a fountain, and surrounding plantings. The gazebo is a stone-clad cube with arched openings on all sides, capped with a pitched roof, and with one corner of the structure deconstructed, to signify conflict and the fragility of civilization. The fountain&#x27;s pool encroaches into this removed corner, with an eternal flame placed in the water so as to appear as though it supports the pavilion structure, to symbolize hope and regeneration. Pope John Paul II lit this flame with an ember from the Peace Flame in Hiroshima, and poured into the pool water from the rivers that flow through Nagasaki. The entire monument was formally dedicated by Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, in October 1984. As part of the redesign of the square, the Peace Garden was moved from the centre of the square to its western edge.

===Reflecting pool and skating rink===

The reflecting pool is situated in the south-east corner of the square. Spanning the reflecting pool are three concrete arches; originally just an architectural feature and support for rink lighting, these were dedicated as the &quot;Freedom Arches&quot; in 1989, to commemorate those who fought to obtain or defend freedom. At the same time, a piece of the Berlin Wall was placed at the southern base of the central arch. To the west of the reflecting pool is a pavilion where food is available; and ice skates are available for rental during the winter months when the pool is used for ice skating.

=== Spirit Garden ===
A spirit garden was created in the square as part of the city&#x27;s Truth and Reconciliation efforts. It contains a monument listing the 18 residential schools that existed in Ontario. There is a turtle sculpture that was created by Anishinaabe artist Solomon King. There is also artwork depicting the Three Sisters. Other installed features include a teaching lodge, inukshuk, spirit canoe, and wampum path.

==History==
The area currently occupied by the square was part of the Ward and was a major immigrant reception area during the first half of the twentieth century characterized by poverty during the late 1800s and early 1900s, with Black families settling on the site followed by the large wave of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe during this period. From 1910s leading up to World War II, the immigrant neighbourhood was gradually settled and developed by the Chinese immigrants into Toronto&#x27;s first Chinatown.

===Development of the square and opening===
Following World War II, the City of Toronto government prepared to construct a civic square in Chinatown, through a by-law which prohibited further development except for public purposes or parking lots. With voter approval in 1947, the city began acquisition of sites inside Chinatown from 1948 to 1958, with expropriation and demolition of various shops and restaurants in 1955 for the development of the square. With the procurement of the land completed and the design of City Hall finalized in 1958, construction commenced in 1961.

The south side of Queen Street opposite City Hall was considered a &#x27;commercial slum&#x27; and in August 1964, Toronto City Council voted to expropriate the south side for development appropriate to the new civic square. The businesses on that side of the street included two burlesque theatres, pawn shops and a cinema. The south side was vacant at the time of the City Hall opening but was eventually occupied by a new hotel, connected by a pedestrian bridge over Queen Street to the square.

The rink was completed before other features in the square, and was officially opened by Mayor Philip Givens on Sunday, 29 November 1964. This was also the first operational part of the new City Hall. It was rushed to completion before the December 1964 municipal election. Other dignitaries present that afternoon were former mayors Nathan Phillips and Allan Lamport. The rest of the square and City Hall was formally completed in September 1965.

To add decoration to the square, City Hall architect Viljo Revell wanted a sculpture by British sculptor Henry Moore. He selected the &quot;Three-Way Piece No. 2&quot; (&quot;The Archer&quot;) at a cost of over . Its purchase was controversial. Toronto Mayor Philip Givens was in favour of the purchase, but some objected to the cost and to the abstract design. The City Council rejected the purchase of the sculpture, but its purchase was funded by a public subscription fund, and the sculpture was installed in 1966.

After the 1972 Summit Series, the Canadian men&#x27;s ice hockey win was feted with a public ceremony hosted by the mayor and the Ontario Premier.

Since the 1980s, the square has been used as the set for a number of films, such as &quot;The Kidnapping of the President&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, and &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. Khalsa Day is celebrated annually at the square with a day of music and food.

===21st century===
A design competition was launched in the start of October 2006, soliciting proposals from forty-eight local and international firms for a revitalization of the square, and, on March 8, 2007, it was announced that the team led by PLANT Architect Inc. and Shore Tilbe Irwin + Partners (both of Toronto) had won the competition. The project was first estimated to cost CAD$45 million, but its final cost is expected to tally $60 million. Originally intended to be completed in 2012, the project is expected to be completed in 2014.

The design is based on the idea that Nathan Phillips Square has always acted as an agora, the ancient Athenian place of public and political exchange, with the design defining the concept of the open space of theatre and that of the public squarea theatre for the city, and a square surrounded by a forested perimeter.

The plans included demolishing and replacing the food and skate rental kiosk, along with the addition of an upper level roof terrace overlooking the square; a two-level restaurant at the southwest corner of the square, with outdoor patio and terrace dining; a glass tourist information pavilion at the Queen and Bay Streets corner; a versatile stage structure under a glazed roof canopy; redesigned landscaping along the edges of the square that increases the number of trees, planting, mixed tree species; expansion and enhancement of the Peace Garden, with a flowering tree grove, eternal flame, and reflecting pool; landscaping and a café on the podium roof of City Hall; a restaurant and bar at the Observation Deck level of the east tower of City Hall; upgrading the overhead walkways with wood decking, seating, glass balustrades, light wells and improved access; and a seasonal disappearing water fountain in the centre of the square.

Sustainable design elements were also included so as to conform to Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Green Standard&quot;, including a soil regeneration strategy, improved tree planting conditions, and increased biomass and number of trees; facilities for cyclists and the promotion of cycling; an improved pedestrian environment; the control of light pollution; energy efficient design; renewable energy features; opportunities for public education; attention to the on-site microclimate; and local sourcing of materials. The square redesign includes a CAD$1.2 million cycle station with storage for 380 bicycles and shower facilities. The cycle station was the cause of some minor controversy at Toronto City Council.

On May 29, 2010, Mayor David Miller officially opened the first phase of the Revitalization project: the Podium Green Roof Garden. The roof garden includes diverse plantings of sedums, perennials, and trees; a Central Courtyard beneath the Council Chamber; a Public Terrace at the southeast corner of the roof, shaded by a tree planter; benches and shade structures designed to reveal the movement of the sun; and a perimeter path which acts as a walking and running circuit around the roof. New lighting has been installed, including new high-efficiency LED floodlights and a perimeter light band, to allow evening events to take place.

====2010s====
In 2011, after the death of federal New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton, citizens flocked to the square and covered the walls, pillars and statues with messages written in chalk for Layton and his family.

During the 2015 Pan American Games, Nathan Phillips Square was one of the sites of &quot;Panamania&quot;, a cultural festival held in conjunction with the Games. Two temporary stages were installed and a platform for performances was installed over part of the reflecting pool. Each evening during the Games, the square was the site of musical concerts, a medal celebration and fireworks. The square also held a count-down clock for the Games, and a &quot;pop-up&quot; store for Pan-Am and Para-PanAm souvenirs.

A large, multi-colored-illuminated 3-D Toronto sign was also installed in the square for the Games; the sign quickly proved to be popular with locals and tourists alike. The sign was to be relocated elsewhere at the end of 2015, however on September 13, 2015, it was announced that the sign will remain in the square permanently.

The square was the host venue for the closing ceremonies of the 2015 Parapan American Games. Nathan Phillips Square was also a venue for Wheelchair tennis for the 2017 Invictus Games.

After the Toronto Raptors won the 2019 NBA Finals, the subsequent parade on June 17, 2019, in Toronto culminated at Nathan Phillips Square, with two million people in total attendance, the largest public gathering in one place for one event in Canadian history; a shooting broke out in a portion of the square where four people were shot and injured.

<doc id="1135324" wikidata="Q3054654" url="?curid=1135324" title="Conjugate variables">
<text>Conjugate variables are pairs of variables mathematically defined in such a way that they become Fourier transform duals, or more generally are related through Pontryagin duality. The duality relations lead naturally to an uncertainty relation—in physics called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle—between them. In mathematical terms, conjugate variables are part of a symplectic basis, and the uncertainty relation corresponds to the symplectic form. Also, conjugate variables are related by Noether&#x27;s theorem, which states that if the laws of physics are invariant with respect to a change in one of the conjugate variables, then the other conjugate variable will not change with time (i.e. it will be conserved).
Conjugate variables in thermodynamics are widely used.

==Examples==
There are many types of conjugate variables, depending on the type of work a certain system is doing (or is being subjected to). Examples of canonically conjugate variables include the following:

* Time and frequency: the longer a musical note is sustained, the more precisely we know its frequency, but it spans a longer duration and is thus a more-distributed event or &#x27;instant&#x27; in time. Conversely, a very short musical note becomes just a click, and so is more temporally-localized, but one can&#x27;t determine its frequency very accurately.
* Doppler and range: the more we know about how far away a radar target is, the less we can know about the exact velocity of approach or retreat, and vice versa. In this case, the two dimensional function of doppler and range is known as a radar ambiguity function or radar ambiguity diagram.
* Surface energy: &quot;γ&quot; d&quot;A&quot; (&quot;γ&quot; = surface tension; &quot;A&quot; = surface area).
* Elastic stretching: &quot;F&quot; d&quot;L&quot; (&quot;F&quot; = elastic force; &quot;L&quot; length stretched).
* Energy and time: Units formula_1 being kg m2 s−1.

===Derivatives of action===
In classical physics, the derivatives of action are conjugate variables to the quantity with respect to which one is differentiating. In quantum mechanics, these same pairs of variables are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
* The &quot;energy&quot; of a particle at a certain event is the negative of the derivative of the action along a trajectory of that particle ending at that event with respect to the &quot;time&quot; of the event.
* The &quot;linear momentum&quot; of a particle is the derivative of its action with respect to its &quot;position&quot;.
* The &quot;angular momentum&quot; of a particle is the derivative of its action with respect to its &quot;orientation&quot; (angular position).
* The &quot;mass-moment&quot; (formula_2) of a particle is the negative of the derivative of its action with respect to its &quot;rapidity&quot;.
* The &quot;electric potential&quot; (φ, voltage) and &quot;electric charge&quot; in a quantum LC circuit.
* The &quot;magnetic potential&quot; (A) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the density of (free) &quot;electric current&quot; at that event. 
* The &quot;electric field&quot; (E) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the &quot;electric polarization density&quot; at that event. 
* The &quot;magnetic induction&quot; (B) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the &quot;magnetization&quot; at that event. 
* The Newtonian &quot;gravitational potential&quot; at an event is the negative of the derivative of the action of the Newtonian gravitation field with respect to the &quot;mass density&quot; at that event. 

===Quantum theory===
In quantum mechanics, conjugate variables are realized as pairs of observables whose operators do not commute. In conventional terminology, they are said to be &quot;incompatible observables&quot;. Consider, as an example, the measurable quantities given by position formula_3 and momentum formula_4. In the quantum-mechanical formalism, the two observables formula_5 and formula_6 correspond to operators formula_7 and formula_8, which necessarily satisfy the canonical commutation relation:
formula_9

For every non-zero commutator of two operators, there exists an &quot;uncertainty principle&quot;, which in our present example may be expressed in the form:
formula_10

In this ill-defined notation, formula_11 and formula_12 denote &quot;uncertainty&quot; in the simultaneous specification of formula_5 and formula_6. A more precise, and statistically complete, statement involving the standard deviation formula_15 reads:
formula_16

More generally, for any two observables formula_17 and formula_18 corresponding to operators formula_19 and formula_20, the generalized uncertainty principle is given by:
formula_21

Now suppose we were to explicitly define two particular operators, assigning each a &quot;specific&quot; mathematical form, such that the pair satisfies the aforementioned commutation relation. It&#x27;s important to remember that our particular &quot;choice&quot; of operators would merely reflect one of many equivalent, or isomorphic, representations of the general algebraic structure that fundamentally characterizes quantum mechanics. The generalization is provided formally by the Heisenberg Lie algebra formula_22, with a corresponding group called the Heisenberg group formula_23.

===Fluid mechanics===
In Hamiltonian fluid mechanics and quantum hydrodynamics, the &quot;action&quot; itself (or &quot;velocity potential&quot;) is the conjugate variable of the &quot;density&quot; (or &quot;probability density).

<text>Collingwood Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, in England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Vauxhall, and is connected to Stanley Dock to the east and Salisbury Dock to the west.

==History==
The dock was designed by Jesse Hartley, and opened in 1848 along with four other Liverpool docks. The dock was named after Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood and was intended to handle relatively small vessels only. The Liverpool Corporation had a berth for its refuse boats in Collingwood Dock for many years. A bascule road bridge spans the passage between Collingwood and Stanley Docks.

==Present==
Collingwood Dock has been little altered since construction. The dock is part of the Stanley Dock Conservation Area 
and is on the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal extension to the Pier Head.

Collingwood dock is home to the Glaciere Maritime Academy.

<doc id="1135333" wikidata="Q3206297" url="?curid=1135333" title="Ambiguity function">
<text>In pulsed radar and sonar signal processing, an ambiguity function is a two-dimensional function of propagation delay formula_1 and Doppler frequency formula_2, formula_3. It represents the distortion of a returned pulse due to the receiver matched filter (commonly, but not exclusively, used in pulse compression radar) of the return from a moving target. The ambiguity function is defined by the properties of the pulse and of the filter, and not any particular target scenario.

Many definitions of the ambiguity function exist; some are restricted to narrowband signals and others are suitable to describe the delay and Doppler relationship of wideband signals. Often the definition of the ambiguity function is given as the magnitude squared of other definitions (Weiss). 
For a given complex baseband pulse formula_4, the narrowband ambiguity function is given by

:formula_5

where formula_6 denotes the complex conjugate and formula_7 is the imaginary unit. Note that for zero Doppler shift (formula_8), this reduces to the autocorrelation of formula_4. A more concise way of representing the
ambiguity function consists of examining the one-dimensional
zero-delay and zero-Doppler &quot;cuts&quot;; that is, formula_10 and
formula_11, respectively. The matched filter output as a function of time (the signal one would observe in a radar system) is a Doppler cut, with the constant frequency given by the target&#x27;s Doppler shift: formula_12.

==Background and motivation==

Pulse-Doppler radar equipment sends out a series of radio frequency pulses. Each pulse has a certain shape (waveform)—how long the pulse is, what its frequency is, whether the frequency changes during the pulse, and so on. If the waves reflect off a single object, the detector will see a signal which, in the simplest case, is a copy of the original pulse but delayed by a certain time formula_1—related to the object&#x27;s distance—and shifted by a certain frequency formula_2—related to the object&#x27;s velocity (Doppler shift). If the original emitted pulse waveform is formula_4, then the detected signal (neglecting noise, attenuation, and distortion, and wideband corrections) will be:

:formula_16

The detected signal will never be &quot;exactly&quot; equal to any formula_17 because of noise. Nevertheless, if the detected signal has a high correlation with formula_17, for a certain delay and Doppler shift formula_19, then that suggests that there is an object with formula_19. Unfortunately, this procedure may yield false positives, i.e. wrong values formula_21 which are nevertheless highly correlated with the detected signal. In this sense, the detected signal may be &quot;ambiguous&quot;.

The ambiguity occurs specifically when there is a high correlation between formula_17 and formula_23 for formula_24. This motivates the &quot;ambiguity function&quot; formula_25. The defining property of formula_25 is that the correlation between formula_17 and formula_23 is equal to formula_29.

Different pulse shapes (waveforms) formula_4 have different ambiguity functions, and the ambiguity function is relevant when choosing what pulse to use.

The function formula_25 is complex-valued; the degree of &quot;ambiguity&quot; is related to its magnitude formula_32.

==Relationship to time–frequency distributions==

The ambiguity function plays a key role in the field of time–frequency signal processing, as it is related to the Wigner–Ville distribution by a 2-dimensional Fourier transform. This relationship is fundamental to the formulation of other time–frequency distributions: the bilinear time–frequency distributions are obtained by a 2-dimensional filtering in the ambiguity domain (that is, the ambiguity function of the signal). This class of distribution may be better adapted to the signals considered.

Moreover, the ambiguity distribution can be seen as the short-time Fourier transform of a signal using the signal itself as the window function. This remark has been used to define an ambiguity distribution over the time-scale domain instead of the time-frequency domain.

==Wideband ambiguity function==

The wideband ambiguity function of formula_33 is:

:formula_34

where &quot;formula_35&quot; is a time scale factor of the received signal relative to the transmitted signal given by:

:formula_36

for a target moving with constant radial velocity &quot;v&quot;. The reflection of the signal is represented with compression (or expansion) in time by the factor &quot;formula_37&quot;, which is equivalent to a compression by the factor &quot;formula_38&quot; in the frequency domain (with an amplitude scaling). When the wave speed in the medium is sufficiently faster than the target speed, as is common with radar, this compression in frequency is closely approximated by a shift in frequency Δf = fc*v/c (known as the doppler shift). For a narrow band signal, this approximation results in the narrowband ambiguity function given above, which can be computed efficiently by making use of the FFT algorithm.

==Ideal ambiguity function==
An ambiguity function of interest is a 2-dimensional Dirac delta function or &quot;thumbtack&quot; function; that is, a function which is infinite at (0,0) and zero elsewhere.

:formula_39

An ambiguity function of this kind would be somewhat of a misnomer; it would have no ambiguities at all, and both the zero-delay and zero-Doppler cuts would be an impulse. This is not usually desirable (if a target has any Doppler shift from an unknown velocity it will disappear from the radar picture), but if Doppler processing is independently performed, knowledge of the precise Doppler frequency allows ranging without interference from any other targets which are not also moving at exactly the same velocity.

This type of ambiguity function is produced by ideal white noise (infinite in duration and infinite in bandwidth). However, this would require infinite power and is not physically realizable. There is no pulse formula_4 that will produce formula_41 from the definition of the ambiguity function. Approximations exist, however, and noise-like signals such as binary phase-shift keyed waveforms using maximal-length sequences are the best known performers in this regard.

== Properties ==

(1) Maximum value

:formula_42

(2) Symmetry about the origin

:formula_43

(3) Volume invariance

:formula_44

(4) Modulation by a linear FM signal

: formula_45

(5) Frequency energy spectrum

:formula_46

(6) Upper bounds for formula_47 and lower bounds for formula_48 exist for the formula_49 power integrals

:formula_50.

These bounds are sharp and are achieved if and only if formula_51 is a Gaussian function.

== Square pulse ==

Consider a simple square pulse of duration formula_1 and
amplitude formula_53:

:formula_54

where formula_55 is the Heaviside step function. The
matched filter output is given by the autocorrelation of the pulse, which is a triangular pulse of height formula_56 and
duration formula_57 (the zero-Doppler cut). However, if the
measured pulse has a frequency offset due to Doppler shift, the
matched filter output is distorted into a sinc function. The
greater the Doppler shift, the smaller the peak of the resulting sinc,
and the more difficult it is to detect the target. 

In general, the square pulse is not a desirable waveform from a pulse compression standpoint, because the autocorrelation function is too short in amplitude, making it difficult to detect targets in noise, and too wide in time, making it difficult to discern multiple overlapping targets.

== LFM pulse ==

A commonly used radar or sonar pulse is the linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulse (or &quot;chirp&quot;). It has the advantage of greater bandwidth while keeping the pulse duration short and envelope constant. A constant envelope LFM pulse has an ambiguity function similar to that of the square pulse, except that it is skewed in the delay-Doppler plane. Slight Doppler mismatches for the LFM pulse do not change the general shape of the pulse and reduce the amplitude very little, but they do appear to shift the pulse
in time. Thus, an uncompensated Doppler shift changes the target&#x27;s apparent range; this phenomenon is called range-Doppler coupling.

==Multistatic ambiguity functions==

The ambiguity function can be extended to multistatic radars, which comprise multiple non-colocated transmitters and/or receivers (and can include bistatic radar as a special case).

For these types of radar, the simple linear relationship between time and range that exists in the monostatic case no longer applies, and is instead dependent on the specific geometry – i.e. the relative location of transmitter(s), receiver(s) and target. Therefore, the multistatic ambiguity function is mostly usefully defined as a function of two- or three-dimensional position and velocity vectors for a given multistatic geometry and transmitted waveform.

Just as the monostatic ambiguity function is naturally derived from the matched filter, the multistatic ambiguity function is derived from the corresponding optimal &quot;multistatic&quot; detector – i.e. that which maximizes the probability of detection given a fixed probability of false alarm through joint processing of the signals at all receivers. The nature of this detection algorithm depends on whether or not the target fluctuations observed by each bistatic pair within the multistatic system are mutually correlated. If so, the optimal detector performs phase coherent summation of received signals which can result in very high target location accuracy. If not, the optimal detector performs incoherent summation of received signals which gives diversity gain. Such systems are sometimes described as &quot;MIMO radars&quot; due to the information theoretic similarities to MIMO communication systems.

==Ambiguity function plane==
An ambiguity function plane can be viewed as a combination of an infinite
number of radial lines.

Each radial line can be viewed as the fractional Fourier transform of a
stationary random process.

<doc id="1135334" wikidata="Q6494418" url="?curid=1135334" title="Last Hours">
<text>Last Hours (known as Rancid News prior to 2005) is an anti-authoritarian publishing collective. From 2003 to 2008 it produced a fanzine, initially called &quot;Rancid News&quot; until issue 9, changing its name to &quot;Last Hours&quot; from issue 10 till the final issue, 17, in May 2008. All 17 issues were edited by Edd Baldry before he stood down as editor. Since 2008 &quot;Last Hours&quot; has become a publishing collective, launching a website, and releasing two books in the autumn of 2009, Excessive Force and Diary of a miscreant.

==Rancid News==
At its inception Rancid News was a punk zine, which began circulation in April 2003 with interviews from AFI, One Minute Silence, and Johnny Truant, alongside articles, columns and reviews. &quot;Rancid News&quot; was initially launched at a time when the &quot;Fracture&quot; and &quot;Reason To Believe&quot; zines were still in existence. After those publications ceased, &quot;Rancid News&quot; assumed their mantel documenting the UK punk . A key difference between &quot;Rancid News&quot; and the aforementioned zines is that &quot;Rancid News&quot; was sold outside gigs, and in record and comic stores rather than being available free. It was compared to San Francisco-based &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot;, due largely to similar political beliefs and style of music covered.

&quot;Rancid News&quot; was often connected with the Household Name records scene, featuring most of the label&#x27;s bands between 2003 and 2005. &quot;Rancid News&quot; was also distributed by many of the Household Name Records bands, including Five Knuckle, Captain Everything!, Adequate Seven, Howards Alias, and Antimaniax amongst others. At its height &quot;Rancid News&quot; distributed around 4,000 copies around the UK and Europe. The zine was printed on newsprint and most issues were 116 pages long, with a colour cover, and saddle stitch binding.

In early 2005 the name &quot;Rancid News&quot; was considered a hindrance. People mistakenly assumed the fanzine had something to do with the punk rock band Rancid and it was felt that it forced contributors to focus too heavily on music. The final issue of &quot;Rancid News&quot;, published in February 2005, gave an indication of the changing direction, with a greater emphasis on radical culture in general and with particular focus on political articles, vegan recipes and longer columns.

The name &quot;Last Hours&quot; was agreed on in a meeting in March 2005, with the first issue - issue 10 - of the fanzine being released in June 2005, with subsequent issues to be released every six months. It maintained a balance between interviews with punk bands and political articles. It was published under the strapline &#x27;Radical culture and punk rock&#x27;.

The print production remained the same as &quot;Rancid News&quot; until issue 13, when the fanzine again changed direction with the first perfect bound edition, and an issue dedication to &#x27;Punk rock and comics&#x27;. It marked the first time that interviews, articles or reviews relating to punk rock took up less than 50% of the fanzine.

After issue 13 each issue of Last Hours was themed in one way or another, most often around the principle article of the zine. So, issue 14 focussed on acoustic punk rock, issue 15 on anarcho-punk compilations, issue 16 on DIY punk rock houseshows, and issue 17 on radical illustration. In all of the issues of &quot;Last Hours&quot; anarchist politics and radical culture took prominence over the music.

==Last Hours live==
&quot;Last Hours&quot; regularly put on gigs in London under the monicker &quot;Last Hours live&quot;. During 2006 these were most often at &quot;The Square&quot;, a squatted social centre in Russel Square, where Last Hours put on, amongst others, The Steal, Ghost Mice, Attack Vipers and The King Blues. During 2007 &quot;Last Hours&quot; continued to put on gigs in squatted social centres around London, including &quot;The Vortex&quot;, in Stoke Newington, and &quot;The New Camberwell Social centre&quot; off Camberwell New Road, Kennington. In late 2007 &quot;Last Hours live&quot; started putting on gigs at the Cross Kings, Kings Cross, to launch Last Hours issue 16, and for the first five months of 2008 had monthly gigs at the venue, including one of Fall of Efrafa&#x27;s few London shows.

In addition to putting on gigs members of the Last Hours/ Rancid News collective have been involved in a number of squatted social centres, for example in 2003 with involvement in the Blackstar collective, 2004 with the In Arms Reach collective, which squatted a building off London&#x27;s Oxford Street for a two-week punk festival, and 2005 at the Institute for Autonomy on Gower Street, London.

==London Zine Symposium==
In 2005 two members of the &quot;Rancid News&quot; collective established the London Zine Symposium, which for the first year was held in the Institute for Autonomy. It has become an annual event, and in 2009 had over 1,000 attendees with talks given by Roger Sabin, Teal Triggs, Barcelona Zine Library, and Alex Wrekk from Portland, United States. Up until 2010 the event had been organised by members of the &quot;Rancid News&quot; or &quot;Last Hours&quot; collective.

==Hiatus==
After issue 17 Last Hours was placed on a brief hiatus as Edd Baldry stepped down as editor of the publication. Other members of the collective pushed for the publication to be migrated to the internet, and a regular resource for the anti-authoritarian and punk communities in the UK. The website was relaunched in early 2009 and long articles written about the protests against the attack on Gaza, photo essays about the G20, and responses to Ian Tomlinson&#x27;s death. It also started publishing a podcast and offering regular vegan recipes.

==&quot;Creative resistance&quot;==
During 2009 Last Hours changed its strapline from &#x27;Radical culture and punk rock&#x27; to &#x27;Creative resistance&#x27;, indicating a greater focus on radical politics and a move away from punk culture. In the autumn of 2009 Last Hours released its first two books. &#x27;Excessive Force&#x27; was a 150-page comic&#x27;s anthology against the police, with the subtitle, &#x27;Police everywhere, justice nowhere&#x27;. It featured artwork from 17 international illustrators about abuses of power by the police. It was a benefit for FitWatch and LDMG, two organisations working to curtail police abuses. &quot;Excessive Force&quot; was the first of what will become a regular comix anthology being produced by Last Hours. At the same time the collective was working on &#x27;Diary of a miscreant&#x27;, a book collecting ten years of the comic zine &quot;Morgenmuffel&quot;, by Isy Morgenmuffel. It offered a document on the anti-globalisation movement through the prism of an anarcha-feminist, vegan who was heavily involved in the manifestations during that period.

Last Hours, in 2010, aims to publish books about the London Zine Symposium, the squatting movement in the UK and a series of posters offering alternative perspectives on subjects such as anarchy, prisons and the general election. It will also be creating a film about the UK small-press and fanzine community.

<text>Stanley Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the Vauxhall area of Liverpool and is part of the northern dock system. The dock is connected to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the east and Collingwood Dock to the west.

==History==

Designed by Jesse Hartley, it opened on 4 August 1848. The dock is the only one in Liverpool which was built inland, all the others being built out from the foreshore. The original quay warehouses are of a similar design to those at Albert Dock and are grade II* listed buildings. The warehouses were built to five storeys, covering an area of . Part of the northern quay warehouse was demolished after sustaining damage in an air raid during World War II. The southern quay warehouse remains, however no longer on a quay. Between 1897 and 1901, the southern part of the dock was filled in to build the large Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse by Anthony George Lyster. The tobacco warehouse stands between the new quay between and the older southern quay warehouse.

There are two entrances to the Stanley Dock complex at the south end from Regent Road and two at the north from Great Howard Street, via sets of three granite towers. These towers are similar in design to the towers in other Liverpool docks, and originally had sliding gates set into the thickness of the wall. There is also a link to the canal which opened in 1848, via the bridge under Great Howard Street, also designed by Hartley. The adjoining branch canal is in length and was built with a staircase of four locks, each apart, with a width of . The staircase was built by J. B. Hartley.

==Regeneration==
The dock is the focal point of the Stanley Dock Conservation Area. In 2006, work commenced on a £20 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further 1.4 miles of navigable waterway towards the Pier Head. As of March 2007, plans have been unveiled for the warehouses to be redeveloped into office space and a total of 930 apartments. The plans involve digging out the centre of the tobacco warehouse to create a garden-filled courtyard.

The site featured as part of the &quot;Most Haunted Live!&quot; Liverpool investigation in January 2009 and in the 2011 superhero film &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;.

The remaining parts of the northern warehouse were in a &quot;poor&quot; condition, and on the Heritage at Risk Register 2011, but were approved for redevelopment. The northern warehouse has since been developed in to a hotel devoted to the White Star Line&#x27;s RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; liner, which has strong links to the area&#x27;s history of docks and shipping.

<text>The Roland MT-32 Multi-Timbre Sound Module is a MIDI synthesizer module first released in 1987 by Roland Corporation. It was originally marketed to amateur musicians as a budget external synthesizer with an original list price of $695. However, it became more famous along with its compatible modules as an early &quot;de facto&quot; standard in computer music. Since it was made prior to the release of the General MIDI standard, it uses its own proprietary format for MIDI file playback.

Within Roland&#x27;s family of linear arithmetic (LA) synthesizers, the multitimbral MT-32 series constitutes the budget line for computer music at home, the multitimbral D-5, D-10, D-20 and D-110 models constitute the professional line for general studio use, and the high-end bitimbral D-50 and D-550 models are for sophisticated multi-track studio work. It was the first product in Roland&#x27;s line of Desktop Music System (DTM) packages in Japan.

==Features==
Like the Roland D-50 Linear Synthesizer, it uses linear arithmetic synthesis, a form of sample-based synthesis combined with subtractive synthesis, to produce its sounds. Samples are used for &quot;attacks&quot; and drums, while traditional synthesis assures the &quot;sustain&quot; phase of the sounds.

The original MT-32 comes with a preset library of 128 synth and 30 rhythm sounds, playable on 8 melodic channels and one rhythm channel. It also features a digital reverberation effect. Successors (see below) added a library of 33 sound effects. Because of the absence of a piano attack sample, it cannot play a convincing acoustic piano sound.

Sounds are created from up to 4 &quot;partials&quot; which can be combined in various ways (including ring modulation). With 32 partials available overall, polyphony depends on the tonal complexity of the music, and 8 to 32 notes can be played simultaneously.

The MT-32 by default assigns its parts 1~8 and R(hythm) to respond on input MIDI channels 2~9 and 10 respectively. By consequence, MIDI files using the popular channel 1 or the other channels 11~16 cannot have those parts played on the MT-32. However, the MT-32&#x27;s melodic parts can be shifted down to respond to channels 1~8 using a button combination or through MIDI &quot;system exclusive&quot; messages, enabling improved compatibility with non-MT-32-specific MIDI sequences.

Additionally, in 1993 Roland released the &quot;GM2MT&quot; SysEx pack, which can be used to reprogram the MT-32 and compatibles to match General MIDI specifications as closely as possible. 64 of the 128 patches (the limit of possible variations) are completely new or modified sounds, with additional sounds having been added to drum channel 10. Despite this, compatibility with GM is still limited by the lack of parts (9 on the MT-32, 16 per GM specification) and reversed panpot compared to MMA MIDI specifications. The utility was predated by a pack called &quot;MT32GS&quot;, released by Mike Cornelius in 1992. The CM-Panion, by Gajits Music Software, was an Amiga editor which worked with the MT-32.

==MT-32 models==
Two major revisions of the MT-32 were produced. Roland refers to them as MT-32 (Old / Without headphones) and MT-32 (New / With headphones).


=== MT-32 (old) ===
The LA32 sound generation chip is an 80-pin PGA. The control CPU is an Intel C8095-90 in ceramic DIP-48 package. The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is a Burr-Brown PCM54; the input signal having a resolution of 15 bits (see below). Line-outs are unbalanced 1/4″ TS phone connector (separate left and right channels.) No headphone jack.
*MT-32 with revision 0 PCB, used in units up to serial number 851399.
The PGA LA32 chip is later replaced with a 100-pin QFP type.
*MT-32 with &quot;old-type&quot; revision 1 PCB, used in units with serial numbers 851400–950499.
===MT-32 (new)===
The control CPU is an Intel P8098. Same Digital-to-analog converter (DAC), but with 16 bits of input signal resolution (see below). A stereo 1/4″ TRS headphones jack is added.
*MT-32 with &quot;new-type&quot; revision 1 PCB, used in units with serial numbers 950500 and up.
*Roland MT-100: Combination of MT-32 and Roland PR-100 (Sequencer and 2.8&quot; Quick-Disk). While it uses a MT-32 (New) PCB, the chassis is different.
MT-32 (Old) that have had the mainboard replaced by Roland because of a repair can contain the MT-32 (New) mainboard, with the headphone jack removed.

==MT-32 compatible models==
To target computer users, Roland released a number of CM (Computer Music) modules. They came without an LCD display and had most buttons removed. Most of these CM modules aside from the CM-32P and CM-300 are compatible with the MT-32 but feature 33 additional sound effect samples which many games took advantage of. These sound effects cannot be heard on an MT-32. 
Early models share a similar design to MT-32 (New). Control CPU is an Intel P8098 and DAC is a Burr-Brown PCM54.
*Roland CM-32L: Released in 1989, this Roland CM has only a volume knob, a MIDI message and a power-on indicator as external controls.
*Roland CM-64: A combination of the CM-32L and the CM-32P, a cut-down &quot;computer music&quot; version of the Roland U-110. Like the CM-32P, the CM-64 can be expanded with a Roland SN-U110 sound library card (compared to four on the U-110.) The CM-32P part plays on MIDI channels 11-16 which are not used by the CM-32L part.
*Roland LAPC-I: ISA bus expansion card for IBM PCs and compatibles. Includes the MPU-401 interface.
In later models, the DAC is a Burr-Brown PCM55, and vibrato is noticeably faster.
*Roland CM-32LN: Sound module for the NEC PC-98 series notebook computers, featuring a special connector for direct connection to the computer&#x27;s 110-pin expansion port. Released in Japan only.
*Roland CM-500: A combination of the CM-32LN with the Roland GS-compatible Roland CM-300, the &quot;computer music&quot; version of the Roland SC-55. Released around 1992.
*Roland LAPC-N: C-Bus expansion card for the NEC PC-98 series of computers. Released in Japan only.
*Roland RA-50: LA unit with CM-32L ROM (but not all CM-32L samples): Requires software work around or hardware modification to work 100% as a MT-32.

==Sound quality problems==
Given the MT-32 was intended to be a relatively low-cost prosumer product, many corners were cut in the design of its DAC output. For example, the circuitry needed to properly calibrate the DACs was omitted, resulting in distortion of the analog signal.

Despite having the capabilities of a professional synthesizer module, the noisy output of the MT-32 caused it to be generally considered unsuitable for professional studio use, although it was considered sufficient for use as the sound engine within other Roland prosumer products of the period. For example, the E-20 keyboard internally contains a partially unpopulated MT-32 (New) motherboard, while the RA-50 Realtime Arranger uses a highly modified one. However, an aftermarket modification was available from Real World Interfaces to improve the MT-32&#x27;s sound quality and generally increase its suitability for professional use.

===Digital overflow===
The MT-32 and compatible modules use a parallel 16-bit DAC at a sampling rate of 32,000 Hz. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio without investing in higher-quality components, the volume of the digital signal fed into the DAC is doubled by shifting all 15 non-sign-carrying data bits to the left, which amounts to multiplying the amplitude by two while keeping the noise floor constant at the analogue output.

However, if this doubled amplitude exceeds the amount that can be represented with 16 bits, an arithmetic overflow occurs, audible as a very loud popping or cracking noise that occurs whenever the original signal crosses +16384/-16384 (the value of bit 14 lost in the bit shift).

This bit shift is implemented differently between module generations. In first-generation modules, this bit shift is performed at the connection between the data bus and DAC:
 Original (non-shifted) data bit # Connection
 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 Output of LA32 synthesizer chip
 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 Input to reverberation chip
 15 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00—input to DAC
 | +- most significant data-carrying bit
 +- sign bit
This means that the reverberation chip will not &quot;see&quot; the overflow noise and thus not reverberate it. However, since bit 14 is dropped completely, the effective resolution is reduced to 15 bits, and since the DAC&#x27;s least significant bit is not connected at all and thus not changing with the sign, additional one-bit noise is produced, audible at low signal levels.

In second-generation modules, the bit shift is performed at the connection between the LA32 sound generation chip and the data bus:
 Original (non-shifted) data bit # Connection
 15 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 14 output of LA32 synthesizer chip
 15 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 14 input to reverberation chip
 15 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 14 input to DAC
 | +- most significant data-carrying bit
 +- sign bit
This means that the reverberation chip will &quot;see&quot; the overflow noise and thus reverberate it. However, since the DAC&#x27;s least significant bit is connected and does change with the sign, the sound quality is improved slightly over the earlier implementation.

To prevent digital signal overflow and its audible result, the digital output volume must be kept low enough so that bit 14 will never be used. On the first generation MT-32, this can simply be done by selecting a lower main volume on the unit&#x27;s front panel, which directly controls the software main volume setting, which in turn directly translates into the amplitude of the digital output signal. On later generation units, this does not work, as the main volume knob and the software main volume setting only modify the volume of the analogue output using voltage-controlled amplifiers and have little effect on the amplitude of the digital signal. To prevent signal overflow, each individual part&#x27;s volume (controller #7) must be kept low instead.

===A third-party solution===
In the period of 1989 to 1993, Robin Whittle of Real World Interfaces offered aftermarket modifications to the MT-32 to address its sound quality issues, as well as improve the functionality of the reverberation unit, provide discrete analog outputs for the internal reverb send and reverb return, and provide battery backup of the MT-32&#x27;s settings.

According to documentation written in 1990, these modifications were only available for the first-generation MT-32, and not the later &quot;headphone&quot; model or any of the other MT-32 derivatives.

Note that the RWI modifications were intended for those using the MT-32 professionally, and may cause some minor compatibility issues with video game soundtracks intended for a stock MT-32. In particular the changes to the reverb unit functionality will likely cause an RWI modified MT-32 to render reverberation differently from what was intended, with possibly detrimental effects.
Additionally an article in the Elektor magazine of December 1990 titled &quot;Digitally controlled mute circuit&quot; by A. Ferndown detailed a mute circuit specially designed for use with the Roland MT-32 module. Article abstract mentions &quot;The mute circuit presented here Is specially designed for use with the Roland MT-32 module, although with some small alterations it should be suitable for use with other makes of expander er synthesizer. lt is intended to eliminate the noise that the expander produces after a note-off. This noise, which remains audible, becomes pretty irritating after a while when the expander is used at home. For studio use a noise gate is, of course, used&quot;.

==Compatibility problems==
First generation units, having control ROM versions below 2.00, require a 40 millisecond delay between system exclusive messages. Some computer games which were programmed to work with the compatible modules (see above) or later ROM versions that do not require this delay, fail to work with these units, producing incorrect sounds or causing the firmware to lock up due to a buffer overflow bug, requiring turning the unit off and on. However, some games were designed to exploit errors in earlier units, causing incorrect sound on later revisions.

Also, some games were written to use instruments not found in the MT-32 models, and require a compatible module, such as a CM-32L, for proper sound playback.

==Music for PC games==
Despite its original purpose as a companion to other professional MIDI equipment, the MT-32 became one of several de facto standards for PC computer game publishers. Sierra On-Line, a leading PC game publisher of the time, took an interest in the sound-design of its PC games. Sierra secured a distribution deal to sell the MT-32 in the US, and invested heavily in giving its game titles (at the time) state-of-the-art sound by hiring professional composers to write in-game music. &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV&quot;, released in 1988, was the first Sierra title with a complete musical soundtrack scored on the MT-32.

The MT-32 with a necessary MPU-401 interface cost $550.00 to purchase from Sierra when it first sold the device. Although the MT-32&#x27;s high price prevented it from dominating the end-user market of players, other PC publishers quickly followed Sierra&#x27;s lead, expanding the role of music in their own game titles with Roland supporting the industry by releasing CM modules for computer users. The MT-32 remained popular for musical composition well into the early 1990s, when the game-industry began to shift toward CD Audio. For a time, it was described as providing &quot;the most realistic sound available in computer gaming today&quot;.

The proliferation of the General MIDI standard, along with competition from less expensive &quot;wavetable&quot; sample-based soundcards, led to the decline of musical soundtracks using the MT-32&#x27;s proprietary features. Games that played General MIDI tracks on the MT-32 initialized the MT-32&#x27;s sound bank to approximate the General MIDI Level 1 (GM1) specification, but avoided any of the MT-32&#x27;s hallmark music-synthesis features, adhering to GM1&#x27;s rather limited set of controllers.

==Emulation==
Due to the popularity of the MT-32 as a music playback device for computer games, many modern sound cards provide a simple &quot;MT-32 emulation mode&quot;, usually realized by way of a sound mapping comprised either of General MIDI instruments rearranged to roughly represent the MT-32&#x27;s preset sound bank, or of samples directly recorded from the original unit. Later modules like most of the Roland Sound Canvas series, Yamaha MU-series and the Kawai GMega feature such limited MT-32 backwards compatibility modes. Results are often considered poor, as the sampling technology used can not reflect the pitch- and time-variable characteristics of the original synthesizer technology, and programming of custom sounds (see above) is not being supported at all. One exception is the Orchid SoundWave 32 card released by Orchid Technology in 1994, whose on-board digital signal processor (DSP) allowed for a more faithful reproduction of the original sound characteristics.

More recently, there have been attempts at emulating the LA synthesizer technology in software using images of the original PCM and control ROMs. The most notable of these emulators is the open-source project Munt, which emulates the MT-32 hardware by way of a virtual device driver for Microsoft Windows, or a virtual MIDI device for OS X, BSD and Linux. It is also incorporated into ScummVM, an open-source adventure game interpreter, as of version 0.7.0. Munt is based on an earlier MT-32 Emulation Project, which was the source of a short-lived legal argument over distribution of the original ROM images with Roland Corporation, who manufactured the MT-32 and claims copyright on the ROM&#x27;s data.

The Raspberry Pi Single-board computer has an open-source software emulator called the mt-32 pi. This project allows for hardware emulation of the MT-32 by use of additional hardware. The project originally started as an emulation solution for the Roland MT-32 synth module, using the open-source Munt emulation core.

Roland offers emulation of classic synthesizers via the Roland Cloud subscription service. Support for the D-50 was added in June 2017.

<text>Unione Sportiva Lecce () is a professional Italian football club based in Lecce, Apulia. The club play in Serie A in the 2023–24 season, the top level of the Italian football pyramid. Lecce plays its home games at Stadio Via del Mare, which has a capacity of 31,533 spectators.

The club was formed in 1927 upon an idea of 1908 and has spent a large part of their recent history bouncing between Italy&#x27;s second division and Serie A, where the team debuted in the 1985–86 season. Its best Serie A finish is the ninth place obtained in the 1988–89 season. The club is 27th in the Serie A all-time table and is the second club from Apulia with appearances in the first two tiers of Italian football, with 16 Serie A seasons and 29 Serie B seasons.

Lecce won Serie B titles in 2022 and 2010, a Coppa Italia Serie C in 1975 and an Anglo-Italian Cup Semiprofessionals in 1976.

Lecce players and fans are nicknamed &quot;salentini&quot; or simply &quot;giallorossi&quot; or &quot;lupi&quot;.

==History==

Lecce was founded as Sporting Club Lecce on 15 March 1908, initially including football, track-and-field and cycling sports. The first club president was Francesco Marangi. The first colours worn by Lecce during this time were black and white stripes, known in Italy as &quot;bianconeri&quot;.

In its formative years, Lecce played in mostly regional leagues and competitions. During the 1923–24 season, the club dissolved before returning on 16 September 1927 as Unione Sportiva Lecce. The club was still wearing black and white stripes (similar to Juventus&#x27; kit) at this point, and the first president under the name Unione Sportiva Lecce was Luigi López y Rojo.

===League: Early years 1930s, 40s and 50s===
Taranto Sport played Lecce in a game for promotion to Serie B from the local Southern Italian league; Lecce were victorious winning 3–2 after extra time. They were entered into Serie B for the 1929–30 season. The first game match played in the league was against Novara on 6 October 1929, a 2–1 victory. Lecce would eventually finish 13th. However, for the second time in the club&#x27;s history, it ceased activity at the end of the 1931–32 season.

Four years later, Lecce returned and competed Serie C, finishing 11th in their return season. Around this time, the club was in turmoil: the following season they withdrew from Serie C after four days, and then during the 1938–39 season, they finished in third place but were moved down to 12th after it was revealed the club had violated the league&#x27;s federal regulations.

The club finished in first place during the 1943–44 season, but club football was then suspended due to World War II. Nonetheless, when club football resumed, Lecce finished as champions of Serie C, gaining promotion back into Serie B. Two decent seasons followed (finishing fourth and third in respective seasons), with star player Silvestri scoring 20 goals in one season, before the club was relegated.

Lecce stayed down in Serie C for six seasons during this period, though this was not a particularly successful time for the club. Striker Anselmo Bislenghi scored 83 goals for the club during this period, thus becoming a hero. The club slipped even lower to Serie IV, where they spent three years.

===Seventeen seasons of Serie C: 1960s, 70s and 80s===
From 1959 to 1975, Lecce played 17 seasons in Serie C. They came extremely close to promotion several times during that period, finishing in second place three consecutive seasons (1971–72 to 1973–74) before gaining promotion in the 1975–76 season.

The same year as their promotion, Lecce tasted cup success, winning the Coppa Italia Serie C. In 1976, Lecce took part in the Anglo-Italian Cup, notching up a 4–0 victory against Scarborough.

In 1980, a scandal occurred which rocked Italian football, including Lecce under president Franco Jurlano. However, Jurlano was able to demonstrate his innocence and the scandal only lead to disqualification of player Claudius Merlo. Later, the club was struck by a tragedy in 1983: players Michele Lo Russo and Ciro Pezzella died in an automotive accident. To this day, Lo Russo remains the club record holder for most number of appearances, with 415.

===Promotion to Serie A: mid-1980s and 90s===
Under the management of Eugenio Fascetti, Lecce would achieve promotion to Serie A for the first time in 1985. They finished bottom and were relegated after only one season, but defeated Roma 3–2 away in the penultimate game to deal a fatal blow to Roma&#x27;s title hopes. Losing a promotion play-off 2–1 to Cesena the following season, they would return to Serie A in 1988.

Under Carlo Mazzone, Lecce finished a respectable ninth place in 1989. Stars of the side included striker Pedro Pasculli and midfielders Antonio Conte and Paolo Benedetti. They lasted three seasons before relegation, and returned two years later. The 1993–94 season saw Lecce finish in last place with a pitiful 11 points, the lowest ever of any Serie A team, and a second relegation came the following year.

Giampiero Ventura saw Lecce achieve two successive promotions from Serie C to Serie A before leaving for Cagliari. Once more, it proved a struggle in Serie A despite the best efforts of striker Francesco Palmieri and a famous away win against Milan on 19 October 1997.

In the summer of 1998, Pantaleo Corvino was appointed new sports director, gaining a reputation for scouting new talents in the years to come. The team was good enough to return to Serie A in 1999 and begin another three-year stint in the top-flight, with yet another return to Serie A in 2003.

===Three years in Serie A (2003–2006)===

In 2004, under Delio Rossi, who had been managing the club since 2002, Lecce achieved an impressive result, reaching a high-point of tenth despite a poor first half of the season. Famous performances include two consecutive sensational victories, first against Italian giants Juventus 3–4 in Turin (the first ever win at the Stadio Delle Alpi for Lecce) and then in the Stadio Via del Mare against Internazionale, 2–1.

In 2004–05, coach Zdeněk Zeman oversaw a highly attack-minded team that scored plenty of goals. Lecce ended the year again finishing tenth, putting in the spotlight talents like Valeri Bojinov and Mirko Vučinić. The team had the second-best attack with 66 goals (Juventus came first with 67) and the worst defence, with 73 goals conceded. This is a record, as for the first time the team with the worst defence managed to survive in the history of Serie A.

The 2005–06 season was a continual struggle for Lecce. The club changed its manager two times (Silvio Baldini for Angelo Adamo Gregucci and in January 2006 youth team coach Roberto Rizzo, supported by goalkeeper coach Franco Paleari, for Baldini). The numerous managerial moves could not turn Lecce&#x27;s fortune as they were relegated with a few games to spare and ended the season in 19th place. In June 2006, Giovanni Semeraro returned at the helm of the club after nine months. The club re-appointed Zdeněk Zeman as manager, just one year after he left the club.

Lecce was unable to avoid relegation from Serie A, despite some initial hope due to the Serie A match-fixing scandal.

===Two-year stint in Serie B and promotion===
The club had a mixed start to the 2006–07 season in Serie B, winning three home matches (including a win against early league leaders Genoa), though they suffered poor away form. After a large drop in form, recording 10 losses in 18 matches, Zeman was sacked as manager and replaced by Giuseppe Papadopulo. On 10 March 2007, Lecce clinched a historical victory over Frosinone, beaten 5–0 at Stadio Via del Mare. Having gained 36 points in the second half of the season, Lecce ended the season in the middle of the table, in ninth place. In 2007, Lecce gained more points than any other team in Serie B.

The 2007–08 season saw Lecce fight for a place in Serie A for the next season. Despite earning 83 points (12 more than sixth-placed Pisa) and boasting the best defence in the tournament, the &quot;giallorossi&quot; were forced to face play-offs for promotion in the top flight. In the semi-final, they beat Pisa in both legs (1–0 away and 2–1 at home) to secure a place in the final against AlbinoLeffe. Then they won the first leg 1–0 away, before securing a 1–1 draw in the second leg at the Studio Via del Mare to gain promotion.

===Between Serie A and Serie B===

After persistent rumours, Papadopulo quit due to a difference of opinion with the general manager of the club and was replaced by Mario Beretta, who had a quite satisfactory start in the 2008–09 Serie A season. He remained in charge for twenty-seven games, but, due to four defeats in the last five matches, with the team one point below the survival zone, he was sacked and Luigi De Canio was appointed new manager. Seven points earned in ten matches were not enough to secure Lecce a spot in the next Serie A season. Relegation was official with one match to spare, after a 1–1 home draw against Fiorentina.

Lecce had a mixed start in the 2009–10 Serie B campaign, but clinched first place in November 2009 and kept it for the rest of the season. In May, the team was on the verge of promotion, but wasted opportunities in their last two matches meant they had to wait until the last match to celebrate their eighth elevation to the top flight in the last 25 years. A goalless home draw with Sassuolo proved enough to clinch the Serie B title with 75 points and win the Coppa Ali della Vittoria.

Lecce ended a satisfactory 2010–11 Serie A season successfully avoiding relegation with one match to spare after beating arch-rival and already relegated Bari 2–0 away on 15 May 2011. In the last few matches, the team managed to win a tough battle against other underdogs and some glorious teams such as Sampdoria that ended the season in despair. Manager Luigi De Canio left the team in June.

In the 2011–12 Serie A season, Lecce was relegated to Serie B. The start of the season was bad and new manager Eusebio Di Francesco was sacked in December, after 9 losses in 13 matches. Serse Cosmi was appointed new manager. Lecce refused to crumble as Cosmi&#x27;s arrival instilled battling qualities into the relegation strugglers, who managed to gain a considerable number of points in the following months, but eventually failed to avoid relegation, due to four losses in the last five matches. Lecce managed to struggle until the final game.

===Third division years===
On 10 August 2012, Lecce was provisionally relegated by the Disciplinary Commission set up for the &quot;Scommessopoli&quot; scandal investigations 2012–13 Lega Pro Prima Divisione because of their involvement. Furthermore, the former president of Lecce, Semeraro, was suspended from all football activities for five years. On 22 August 2012, Lecce&#x27;s relegation was confirmed by the Federal Court of Justice. In the first season back into the third tier, Lecce ended in second place behind outsiders Trapani and was surprisingly defeated in the promotion playoffs finals by another outsider club, Carpi. The following season ended in similar fashion, with Lecce failing to win the league once again and then losing the playoffs finals, this time to Frosinone, despite a number of high-level signings such as former Palermo star, and well-known Lecce supporter, Fabrizio Miccoli. In 2014–15 Lecce ended the season in sixth place and did not enter the playoffs.

Following the departure of the Tesoro family, the club was taken over by a consortium of entrepreneurs led by Saverio Sticchi Damiani. The club ended the 2015–16 season in third place, two points behind the second-placed team, and qualified for the playoffs round. After defeating Bassano 3–0 at home, in the semi-finals Lecce lost to Foggia in both the home and the away match. In the following season, Lecce finished in second place. The elimination came in the play-off quarterfinals against Alessandria on penalties after two draws in two matches.

===Back to the top===
In September 2017, Fabio Liverani was named new coach of Lecce, with whom he achieved two direct promotions from Serie C to Serie A, thus bringing the Salento club back to the Italian top-tier league after seven years. Lecce then fought against Genoa for survival and made it to the last day of the 2019–20 season before being relegated with a home loss to Parma. The &quot;salentini&quot; missed out promotion to Serie A in the 2020–21 season, losing to Venezia in the play-off semifinals after a 4th-place finish, but then, with coach Marco Baroni, won the 2021–22 Serie B championship, thus celebrating their tenth elevation to the top flight and being awarded the Coppa Nexus. Lecce striker Massimo Coda was top scorer of the Serie B for two sonsecutive seasons (2020–21 and 2021–22). The &quot;giallorossi&quot; side then gained survival in the next Serie A campaign with a game to spare, with Baroni and Lecce parting ways at the end of the 2022–23 season.

==Colours, badge, nicknames, and symbols==
The team plays in red and yellow stripes, the heraldic colours of city. Lecce players and fans are referred to as &quot;salentini&quot; or &quot;giallorossi&quot;.

== Club rivalries ==
The main rivalry is with the other most successful football team from Apulia, S.S.C. Bari. The match against them is called &quot;Derby di Puglia&quot;. The first &quot;Derby di Puglia&quot; was played on 8 December 1929 in Serie B in Lecce, with the home team winning 1–0. After that occasion, the derby di Puglia was played many times in Serie C and Coppa Italia, and especially in Serie A. The first derby played in Serie A was played on 27 October 1985 in Bari, and was won by the home team. The last one was also played in Bari on 15 May 2011 and saw Lecce prevailing by 2-0 and securing their stay in Serie A (however that match was later object of an investigation for match-fixing). Among the most important wins in the derby for Lecce there is a Serie B match ended 4–0 in Bari on 22 December 2007.

On the other end, Lecce has a famous and long-standing friendship with the fans of Palermo.

<text>Bartholomew Fair is a Jacobean comedy in five acts by Ben Jonson. It was first staged on 31 October 1614 at the Hope Theatre by the Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men company. Written four years after &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, five after &quot;Epicœne, or the Silent Woman&quot;, and nine after &quot;Volpone&quot;, it is in some respects the most experimental of these plays.

The play was first printed in 1631, as part of a planned second volume of the first 1616 folio collection of Jonson&#x27;s works, to be published by the bookseller Robert Allot; however, Jonson abandoned the plan when he became dissatisfied with the quality of the typesetting. Copies of the 1631 typecast were circulated, though whether they were sold publicly or distributed privately by Jonson is unclear. The play was published in the second folio of Jonson&#x27;s works in 1640–41, published by Richard Meighen.

==Background==
The play is set at Bartholomew Fair, which from 1133 to 1855 was one of London&#x27;s preeminent summer fairs. It opened on 24 August each year at Smithfield, in the northwestern part of the city. Smithfield, a site of slaughterhouses and public executions, was a fitting place for a fair that was part commerce and part spectacle. At once a trading event for cloth and other goods and a pleasure fair, the four-day event drew crowds from all classes of English society.

Jonson&#x27;s play uses this fair as the setting for an unusually detailed and diverse panorama of early seventeenth-century London life. The one day of fair life represented in the play allows Jonson ample opportunity to not just conduct his plot, but also to depict the vivid life of the fair, from pickpockets and bullies to justices and slumming gallants. Jonson also uses the characters that he creates as a way to comment on the social, religious and political conflicts of London society in Jacobean England.

==Synopsis==
The play begins with an extended bit of metadrama; the company&#x27;s stage-keeper enters, criticising the play about to be performed because it lacks romantic and fabulous elements. He is then pushed from the stage by the book-keeper, who (serving as prologue) announces a contract between author and audience. The contract appears to itemise Jonson&#x27;s discontentment with his audiences: Members are not to find political satire where none is intended; they are not to take as oaths such innocuous phrases as &quot;God quit you&quot;; they are not to &quot;censure by contagion&quot;, but must exercise their own judgment; moreover, they are allowed to judge only in proportion to the price of their ticket. Perhaps most important, they agree not to expect a throwback to the sword-and-buckler age of Smithfield, for Jonson has given them a picture of the present and unromantic state of the fair.

The play proper begins with a proctor and amateur dramatist Littlewit and his friends, Quarlous and Winwife; they are plotting how to win Dame Purecraft (a widow, and Littlewit&#x27;s mother-in-law) from Zeal-of-the-Land Busy, a canting, hypocritical Puritan.

This colloquy is interrupted by the entrance of Wasp, the irascible servant of Cokes, a country simpleton who is in town to marry Grace Wellborn. Grace is the ward of Adam Overdo, a Justice of the Peace; Overdo&#x27;s wife is Cokes&#x27;s sister. All of these characters are at Littlewit&#x27;s to get a marriage license; having obtained it, they indulge Cokes&#x27;s wish to visit the fair.

Littlewit and his friends also plan to go to the fair to see a puppet-show Littlewit wrote. To overcome Busy&#x27;s likely objections, they pretend that Win (Littlewit&#x27;s wife) has a pregnant craving for roast pork. The Renaissance audience, familiar with stage satire of Puritans, would not have been surprised that Busy, far from abhorring the fair and its debauchery, is ready to rationalise his presence there as allowable and even godly. The first act ends with both groups, the genteel Overdos and the raffish Littlewits, headed for the fair.

The fair propels these characters through experiences that put their social identities under extreme strain. Justice Overdo, well-read in the &quot;disguised prince&quot; tradition, assumes a disguise to ferret out wrongdoing at the fair; he is beaten by Wasp, falsely accused by Edgeworth, a cut-purse, and put in the stocks. Quarlous and Winwife engage Edgeworth to steal the marriage license from Wasp; he does so when Wasp is arrested after starting a fight. Wasp, too, is put in the stocks. Winwife has abandoned his plan to marry Dame Purecraft; instead, he and Quarlous fight for Grace&#x27;s hand. Win Littlewit and Mistress Overdo are enlisted as prostitutes by the pimp Whit; Zeal-of-the-land Busy is arrested for preaching without license and put into the stocks. Cokes is robbed several times by Edgeworth and other denizens of the fair. All the imprisoned characters escape when Trouble-All, a seeming madman for whom Dame Purecraft has conceived a sudden passion, fights with the guards.

The climax of the play occurs at the puppet show. Madame Overdo and Win are brought in, masked, as prostitutes; Madame Overdo is drunk. Overdo is still in disguise, and Quarlous has disguised himself as Trouble-All; in this guise, he stole the marriage license from Winwife and made it into a license for himself and Purecraft. The puppet show, a burlesque of &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; and &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot;, proceeds until Busy interrupts, claiming that the play is an abomination because the actors are cross-dressed. The puppets refute him decisively by raising their clothes, revealing that they have no sex. Busy announces himself converted into a &quot;beholder&quot; of plays.

At this point, Justice Overdo reveals himself, intent on uncovering the &quot;enormities&quot; he has witnessed at the fair. He is in the process of punishing all of the various schemers and malefactors when his wife (still veiled) vomits and begins to call for him. Abashed, Overdo takes the advice of Quarlous and forgives all parties; Winwife marries Grace, Quarlous marries Purecraft, and all the characters are invited to Overdo&#x27;s house for supper.

==Puritans==

Zeal-of-the-land Busy is Jonson&#x27;s second foray, after &quot;The Alchemist&quot;″s Tribulation and Ananais, into a field of satire common in Jacobean drama: satire against Puritans. Various factors combined to make the godly or &quot;precisians&quot; obvious targets of ridicule. Though religious violence was comparatively uncommon in Jacobean England, the memory of such violence was fresh enough to make marginal believers or outsiders potential sources of anxiety or threat. This element of threat was especially notable in the second decade of James&#x27;s reign, when the tenuous Calvinist consensus in the English Church began to disintegrate. In this context, stage attacks on the godly may have served to channel and release broader anxieties about social trends.

Playwrights also had a more immediate reason for this animosity; Puritans had opposed the public theatre almost from its inception. Hostility to drama was not, of course, limited to separatists or Puritans; preachers of all shades of belief denounced the plays as profane and the theatres as sites of theft, drunkenness, and licentiousness. Correctly or not, playwrights treated Puritans as the main source of these attacks. On stage, the Puritan is a hypocritical, judgmental, and long-winded figure, masking his lusts behind a vocal obsession with trivialities; Busy, for example, announces his intention to eat pork at the fair merely to refute the charges of &quot;Judaism&quot; he claims are levelled at Puritans, and he ends up consuming two whole pigs.

==Performance history==
The induction allows for a more specific date of performance than is usual for Renaissance plays; the première took place on 31 October 1614 at the Hope Theatre in Bankside. Entries in the Revels accounts indicate that the performance was repeated at Whitehall for James I the next day. The royal account also lists ten pounds paid to Nathan Field for acting in the play; in the fifth act, Jonson causes Cokes to ask the puppetmaster, &quot;Which is your best actor now...your Burbage...your Field?&quot;

There is no further record of performance until 1661, although it was likely to have remained in repertory to some degree until its anti-Puritan sentiments made it unwise to revive it. (William Oldys reports a traditional view that the inscription on Jonson&#x27;s tomb (&quot;O rare Ben Jonson&quot;) refers to the applause this play received, after the failure of &quot;Catiline&quot;, indicating some degree of popularity. Samuel Pepys records seeing it four times in 1661, twice with the puppet show and twice without (8 June, 27 June, 31 August and 7 September 1661). The play appears to have been revived intermittently through the earlier part of the eighteenth century; after that, in keeping with the waning taste for non-Shakespearean Renaissance drama in general and for Jonson in particular, the play fell into obscurity. It retained a degree of esteem in the study even as it disappeared from the boards; both Isaac Reed and Horace Walpole praised its wealth of invention in their accounts of Renaissance drama. John Brown revised the play and offered it to David Garrick; Garrick refused it, however, and Brown&#x27;s text is lost.

As with many long-ignored plays, &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; returned to the stage in a production by the Phoenix Society—this one, in 1921 at the New Oxford Theatre. Its first professional revival came in 1949, when George Devine directed it at the Edinburgh International Festival; the next year, the same production appeared at The Old Vic. The puppets in this production were performed by George Speaight. The Bristol Old Vic produced the play in 1966. Terry Hands directed the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1969; this production included Ben Kingsley as Winwife and Helen Mirren as Win Littlewit. The production, which cut the long text and freely mixed period and modern properties, received generally negative reviews. The play was also performed (some time in the 1960s) at the University of California, Berkeley, with Stacey Keach playing Overdo.

Richard Eyre produced the play for the National Theatre; his first production as head of the theatre, it was performed on the Olivier Stage in mid-Victorian costume. David Bamber, David Burke, and Stephen Moore were among the cast. Of this production, Eyre himself writes, &quot;What felt as though it might have been a true popular success … shows itself to be dismal and unachieved.

In 1998, Laurence Boswell directed the play for the RSC at the Swan Theatre. Featuring Zubin Varla and Poppy Miller, the production attempted to update Jonson&#x27;s cheerfully downscale milieu with &quot;Newcastle United shirts, garish yellow tweed and plenty of atmospheric sleaze&quot; according to The Times; this review was mildly favourable, as were the others. The production was later revived at the Young Vic.

The Stratford Shakespeare Festival mounted the New World&#x27;s first professional production of the play in 2009, directed by Antoni Cimolino with original music composed by Steven Page. The cast featured Tom McCamus, Lucy Peacock, and Juan Chioran.

The play was performed in 2019 at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse (part of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe) in London.

<text>St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral Basilica is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto, Canada, and one of the oldest churches in Toronto. It is located at 65 Bond Street in Toronto&#x27;s Garden District. St. Michael&#x27;s was designed by William Thomas, designer of eight other churches in the city, and was primarily financed by Irish immigrants who resided in the area. The cathedral has a capacity of 1600. John Cochrane and Brothers undertook the work on the stone and stucco ornamentation of the interior.

St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral is a major building of faith in downtown Toronto. It was originally constructed away from the city&#x27;s centre, but over time the city has grown to encompass it. It was constructed to better serve the growing Roman Catholic population of Toronto. It is a prime example of the English Gothic Revival style of architecture. On September 29, 2016, the feast day of Saint Michael the Archangel, the cathedral was elevated to a minor basilica.

==Archdiocese==
The cathedral is home to Canada&#x27;s largest English-speaking Catholic archdiocese. The current archbishop is Cardinal Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Leo, appointed by Pope Francis on 11 February 2023. In addition to worship services, the church sponsors a number of outreach programs for nearby residents.

==History==

On April 7, 1845, construction began on St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral and the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, a three-story rectory adjacent to the Neo-Gothic cathedral. Both buildings were designed by William Thomas. Townspeople dug out the foundation by hand in return for a barbecue. Shipwrights made the interior columns out of maple and oak. On May 8, 1845, Bishop Power laid the cornerstone for the cathedral in the four-year-old diocese. Some fragments of a stone pillar from the old Norman-style York Minster Cathedral in England and some small pieces of the oak roof of that same cathedral were sealed within St. Michael&#x27;s cornerstone. St. Michael&#x27;s is a 19th-century interpretation of the Minster&#x27;s 14th century English Gothic style. The connection with York Minster is appropriate, since Toronto was known as the town of York from its settlement in 1793 until it was incorporated in 1834 and the name was changed back.

Bishop Power died on October 1, 1847, having contracted typhus while tending to his flock. His funeral was held at St. Paul&#x27;s, and he was buried in the crypt of the unfinished St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral. Also buried in the crypt is a man who fell from the roof during construction.

The cathedral was dedicated on August 29, 1848, to St. Michael the Archangel. On September 29, 1848, the cathedral was consecrated after substantial work by the Honourable John Elmsley and his friend Samuel G. Lynn to reduce the debt. The 79-meter bell tower, which contains two bells, was consecrated in 1866.

The cathedral played an instrumental role in the founding of nearby St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital when the Sisters of Saint Joseph, who came to Toronto at the request of Bishop Charbonnel to operate an orphanage and settlement house, responded to the need for care during a diphtheria epidemic in 1892.

An Ontario Heritage Trust marker at the church notes its importance in the city&#x27;s history. An additional plaque was installed on March 28, 1982, by the Archdiocese of Toronto at the rectory.

Between 1852 and 1856, the rectory was home to St. Michael&#x27;s College until it moved to its present location near the University of Toronto. St. Michael&#x27;s College School, an all-boys school in the Toronto neighbourhood of Forest Hill, was previously the high school section of the original college.

The choir was started in 1926, and the original parish school founded in 1900 evolved into the present-day choir school. The choirboys from the school have presented a Christmas concert at the cathedral every year since 1939. The school continues to operate jointly under authority of the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music and the Toronto Catholic District School Board.

==Architectural style==

St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral is built in the Gothic revival style. Since it was originally constructed by William Thomas from 1845 to 1848, the building has undergone several renovations. These are the Bishop&#x27;s Palace additions by Joseph Sheard in 1852, the completion of the tower and spire by firm Gundry &amp; Langley from 1865 to 1867, and the addition of dormers by Joseph Connolly in 1890. The interior of the church, divided into a large nave and two tall aisles, is lavishly decorated. The tall arcade, supported by graceful colonnettes, gives the interior space a feeling of openness and adds to the grand sense of scale that the building imposes.

St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral is located to the northwest of Church and Shuter streets in Toronto, with the parish office at 200 Church Street. The building is oriented on an off-east–west axis aligned perpendicular to Church Street, with the main entrance on its west side located at 65 Bond Street. In adherence with the tradition of medieval churches, the cathedral&#x27;s high altar is in the east end of the building, facing Jerusalem. The general composition of the building resembles that of a 13th or 14th century Gothic cathedral; however, the design is simplified and does not contain elements such as flying buttresses, transepts, or ribbed vaults. Also, because there are no transepts, the cathedral itself does not assume the typical cruciform shape of most medieval Gothic cathedrals. Conversely, the secondary altars, or side-chapels, divide the cathedral in two down its length, providing a slight outcrop visible from the exterior. The building can be further subdivided down its length by the nine bays framed by the buttresses on the exterior of the building.

The cathedral&#x27;s tower supports a large iron spire located over its west entrance. At its tallest point, the tower reaches or approximately 26 stories above the ground, surpassing the height of many of the surrounding buildings. The scale of the cathedral is quite large within the context of its immediate surroundings; however, when examined in context with the surrounding office towers, the size of the cathedral shrinks considerably. From the exterior, the building maintains a distinctly Gothic appearance characterized by its pointed arches, buttressed walls, stone moulding and sharp iron accents. The building is set back considerably from the street and features a tall iron fence around its perimeter, which further contributes to the building&#x27;s sharp appearance. The fence allows the building to maintain a semi-private front yard, featuring a stone-paved roundabout on its west side and a garden along its south side. Access from the east side of the building is limited due to the connection with the cathedral&#x27;s rectory.

===Exterior===

The exterior façade of the church is a cream-coloured brick with stone accents. The exterior has a neutral colour scheme, which contrasts the beauty of the interior. Teal-coloured shingles contrast gently with the cream exterior walls. In regards to shape, all of the façades vary considerably. The western façade houses the main entrance and pinnacle tower, and is arguably the most impressive side of the church. It faces Bond Street, with the building set back from the property line to create a small forecourt. The spire reaches a height of 260 feet. Much of the northern façade is hidden by the rectory and St. Michael&#x27;s Choir School&#x27;s main building. What little can be seen is spoiled by the protruding fire escape exit. The eastern façade, while not as impressive as the western façade, is, arguably, the most varied. A second school building occupies a site on the west side of Bond Street.

Typical characteristics structures of Gothic Architecture include pointed arches called &#x27;ogivals&#x27;, flying buttresses, transverse arms, clerestory windows, pinnacles, and ribbed vaults, many of which are displayed in St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral.

St. Michael&#x27;s is a good example of a basilica, being a large, rectilinear space with a longitudinal axis. The church runs along an east–west axis, with an extruded portion running north–south, but not nearly as big as the main roof axis. The main axis is represented by the sloped roofs meeting together at the exact middle of the church. All axes are either parallel or perpendicular to each other, so the exterior of church has a very linear and symmetrical feel.

===Interior===

On the inside, the centre aisle along the main axis between the pews used for formal processions dominates. It is also used by parishioners taking their seats and going up for communion. The interior of the cathedral is laid out to create 5 designated spaces: a foyer (the narthex), the balcony, central aisle, left aisle and right aisle. When entering the church, the narthex creates a space that separates the public space from the sacred space. Marble stoups that contain holy water are located to the sides of the doors. Downstairs, there are the Crypt Chapel and Gift Store.

Three sets of double-doors mirroring the front entrances allow guests into the cathedral. When entering the sacred space of the cathedral, its mass is arranged linearly based on a vertical axis, with two main arcades of stone. The two main arcades consists of ivory piers with patterned spandrels of blue and red, however, string courses outline the decorated triforium. The first three piers closest to the altar are topped with red abacuses to define the sacred space. The left and right aisles begin with ribbed vaults and then transition into an exposed beam ceiling. The interior walls are painted grey stone over plaster. The walls are lined with wall arcades. Facing the aisles, an etching of a Gothic window profile is encrusted on each of the wooden benches. At the back of the cathedral are lacquered wooden sculptures. In the back corners of the cathedral there are four wooden confessionals mimicking the arcade arches. The panels of the confessional are decorated with crosses.

Sixteen cast-iron lanterns hang from the tall aisles that light up the cathedral. About midway down the aisles, there are two small chapels; the Blessed Virgin chapel on the north behind the baptismal font, and the Sacred Heart chapel on the south, decorated with small colourful stone tiles. Lit candles flickering in red and blue illuminate the sides of the church. Classic artwork like The Last Supper, as well as other religious paintings of Jesus, priests, and John the Baptist hang above the sanctuary. These paintings, murals and vignettes were done in the 1930s.

Various sculptures of saints sit along the side aisles in front of the stained glass windows. The St. Michael&#x27;s church choir sit on the right side of the altar. Behind the altar is a semi-circular oak reredos with one large episcopal chair of the Archbishop and six smaller chairs on either side for members of the clergy.

===Stained-glass windows===

Unlike many of the cathedrals constructed during the Gothic Revival Period, St. Michael&#x27;s retains a rich and colourful interior characteristic of classic Gothic cathedrals. The stained-glass in the cathedral is of the &quot;antique&quot; variety, which is hand-blown in typical medieval style resulting in deeper colour when compared to typical machine-rolled glass used in other churches at the time. The largest piece of stained glass, located on the east side of the building was imported from France in 1858 and created by Étienne Thévenot, the same artist who created some of the windows for Notre-Dame and various other churches in Paris. The stained-glass windows located on the north and south walls originate from Austria and Bavaria and were installed during the late 1800s and early 1900s replacing the original clear pane. Despite the intentional Gothic style evident in many of the designs of these windows they are actually late-baroque in style.

The eastern stained glass window above the altar, the focus of the church&#x27;s interior is the stained glass window of the crucifixion. The tableau was installed in 1858 by Étienne Thévenot, a French pioneer of the medieval glass revival. Blue, yellow and red are the most prominent colours in the window. The deep blue sky with small blood-red squares of glass leading in the regular grid fall into larger and smaller bands of maroon, plum, and purple enlivened by emerald, viridian and gold. The central panel of the oculus is a depiction of the Blessed Sacrament symbolizing the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Underneath the stained glass window is an intricate wooden reredos with gold and green detailing.

===Restorations===
The exterior of the cathedral has remained relatively unchanged over the last 100 years. In 1864, the Toronto firm Gundry and Langley added an enlarged sacristy to the cathedral. In 1866, the same firm was also responsible for the addition of the tower and spire which adorns the west entrance of the cathedral.

In 1880, the current three-manual pipe organ was installed in the cathedral&#x27;s gallery by Archbishop Joseph Lynch. The dormered windows located on the roof were added some time in the 1890s with the intent to improve the cathedral&#x27;s appearance; it is believed that architect Joseph Connolly was responsible for their design. The interior of the building has remained the same in terms of its plan; however, since the Second Vatican Council, the original high altar was dismantled and used to create a new tabernacle shrine, now located to the south of the sanctuary, while a new table altar was placed in the centre of the sanctuary. Most of the present paintings that adorn the roof and walls of the cathedral date to 1937, with several smaller ones having been added since, the most recent in 1982.

To the right of the altar, there is a wooden monument for the Blessed Sacrament that is the result of a re-design of 1980 directed by Gerald Emmett Cardinal Carter. In 2011, restorations took place that included the west facade being cleaned, bringing the bricks back to their original yellow colour.

In June 2015, it was announced that the 168-year-old cathedral would be closing for the next nine months to deal with safety concerns over a long-running restoration process. St. Paul&#x27;s Basilica planned to add three weekend Masses to accommodate parishioners from St. Michael&#x27;s. The cathedral was slated to open briefly in December 2015 for Christmas masses before closing again until March 2016.

Concrete pillars replaced existing ones after it was discovered that mortar was failing.

The original pipe organ and the balcony which supported it were replaced with a new balcony constructed which supports a new pipe organ and additional seating for 250 more parishioners. In August 2015, emergency crews had to retrieve a woman who had climbed the exterior scaffolding.

On December 8, 2015, the archdiocese hosted an open house to showcase the work done this far on the restoration. It was rededicated on the Feast of St. Michael, Thursday September 29, 2016, by Thomas Cardinal Collins, Archbishop of Toronto.

<text>Pablo Milanés Arias (24 February 1943 – 22 November 2022) was a Cuban guitar player and singer. He was one of the founders of the Cuban nueva trova, along with Silvio Rodríguez and Noel Nicola. His music, originating in the Trova, Son and other traditional styles of early 20th Century Cuban music, set him apart from the style of Silvio Rodríguez.

==Biography==
Pablo Milanés, widely known as Pablito, moved with his family from Bayamo to Havana in 1950. He studied in the Conservatorio Municipal de La Habana, at the time the most prestigious musical school in the country. His first public performance was in 1956. By age 15, he was active in &quot;bohemian&quot; musical circles in Havana, associated with the so-called &quot;filin&quot; musicians.

Although he supported the Cuban Revolution, in 1965 he was sent to the UMAP agricultural forced-labor camp in Camagüey. In 1967, he escaped and fled to Havana to denounce the injustice of the labor camp. This resulted in his imprisonment, first for two months in La Cabaña, an 18th-century fortress in Havana, and then for a time in a prison camp. He was released when the prison camp was closed due to international pressure.

In 1969, he became part of the Grupo de Experimentación Sonora, a seminal group of young musicians, many of whom became founding members of the nueva trova, which started as a movement with a concert given by Pablo, Silvio Rodriguez, and Noel Nicola on 18 February 1968. Until the late 1980s, nueva trova was the unofficial musical style of the Cuban Revolution.

Since his first recording (&quot;Versos sencillos de José Martí&quot; in 1973), he issued more than 40 solo records, and many more in collaboration with other artists from Cuba, elsewhere in Latin America, and Spain. His first record with original songs (the eponymous &quot;Pablo Milanés&quot;) was not issued until 1976. The heyday of his creativity occurred probably in the early 1980s, with his records &quot;Yo me quedo&quot;, &quot;El guerrero&quot;, and &quot;Comienzo y final de una verde mañana&quot;.

Within the context of the nueva trova, Pablo was widely considered one of the closest to the traditional roots of Cuban music, while being open to diverse musical influences from other contemporary traditions, such as Brazilian music and Blues. The range of his compositions extended from starkly political anthems to inspired love songs. He set the poems of Cuban writers such as José Martí and Nicolás Guillén to music. Some of his most important musical influences were María Teresa Vera, Lorenzo Hierrezuelo, Barbarito Diez, Benny Moré, Lucho Gatica, and Johann Sebastian Bach.

He lived in Vigo, Spain, with his Spanish wife and two sons since 2004. In 2014, he received a kidney transplant, receiving an organ donated by his wife.

Since relocating to Spain, Milanés was publicly critical of some aspects of the Cuban government, though he remained dedicated to the Cuban Revolution. In 2011, it was reported that his willingness to speak openly about the failures of the revolution strained his relations with Silvio Rodriguez. At that time, he did not participate in pro-government campaigns.

<doc id="1135408" wikidata="Q1932543" url="?curid=1135408" title="Data migration">
<text>Data migration is the process of selecting, preparing, extracting, and transforming data and permanently transferring it from one computer storage system to another. Additionally, the validation of migrated data for completeness and the decommissioning of legacy data storage are considered part of the entire data migration process. Data migration is a key consideration for any system implementation, upgrade, or consolidation, and it is typically performed in such a way as to be as automated as possible, freeing up human resources from tedious tasks. Data migration occurs for a variety of reasons, including server or storage equipment replacements, maintenance or upgrades, application migration, website consolidation, disaster recovery, and data center relocation.

==The standard phases==
, &quot;nearly 40 percent of data migration projects were over time, over budget, or failed entirely.&quot; Thus, proper planning is critical for an effective data migration. While the specifics of a data migration plan may vary—sometimes significantly—from project to project, IBM suggests there are three main phases to most any data migration project: planning, migration, and post-migration. Each of those phases has its own steps. During planning, dependencies and requirements are analyzed, migration scenarios get developed and tested, and a project plan that incorporates the prior information is created. During the migration phase, the plan is enacted, and during post-migration, the completeness and thoroughness of the migration is validated, documented, and closed out, including any necessary decommissioning of legacy systems. For applications of moderate to high complexity, these data migration phases may be repeated several times before the new system is considered to be fully validated and deployed.

Planning: The data and applications to be migrated are selected based on business, project, and technical requirements and dependencies. Hardware and bandwidth requirements are analyzed. Feasible migration and back-out scenarios are developed, as well as the associated tests, automation scripts, mappings, and procedures. Data cleansing and transformation requirements are also gauged for data formats to improve data quality and to eliminate redundant or obsolete information. Migration architecture is decided on and developed, any necessary software licenses are obtained, and change management processes are started.

Migration: Hardware and software requirements are validated, and migration procedures are customized as needed. Some sort of pre-validation testing may also occur to ensure requirements and customized settings function as expected. If all is deemed well, migration begins, including the primary acts of data extraction, where data is read from the old system, and data loading, where data is written to the new system. Additional verification steps ensure the developed migration plan was enacted in full.

Post-migration: After data migration, results are subjected to data verification to determine whether data was accurately translated, is complete, and supports processes in the new system. During verification, there may be a need for a parallel run of both systems to identify areas of disparity and forestall erroneous data loss. Additional documentation and reporting of the migration project is conducted, and once the migration is validated complete, legacy systems may also be decommissioned. Migration close-out meetings will officially end the migration process.

===Project versus process===
There is a difference between data migration and data integration activities. Data migration is a project through which data will be moved or copied from one environment to another, and removed or decommissioned in the source. During the migration (which can take place over months or even years), data can flow in multiple directions, and there may be multiple simultaneous migrations. The ETL (extract, transform, load) actions will be necessary, although the means of achieving these may not be those traditionally associated with the ETL acronym.

Data integration, by contrast, is a permanent part of the IT architecture, and is responsible for the way data flows between the various applications and data stores—and is a process rather than a project activity. Standard ETL technologies designed to supply data from operational systems to data warehouses would fit within the latter category.

==Categories==
Data is stored on various media in files or databases, and is generated and consumed by software applications, which in turn support business processes. The need to transfer and convert data can be driven by multiple business requirements, and the approach taken to the migration depends on those requirements. Four major migration categories are proposed on this basis.

===Storage migration===
A business may choose to rationalize the physical media to take advantage of more efficient storage technologies. This will result in having to move physical blocks of data from one tape or disk to another, often using virtualization techniques. The data format and content itself will not usually be changed in the process and can normally be achieved with minimal or no impact to the layers above.

===Database migration===

Similarly, it may be necessary to move from one database vendor to another, or to upgrade the database software being used. The latter case is less likely to require a physical data migration, but this can happen with major upgrades. In these cases a physical transformation process may be required since the underlying data format can change significantly. This may or may not affect behavior in the applications layer, depending largely on whether the data manipulation language or protocol has changed. However, some modern applications are written to be almost entirely agnostic to the database technology, so a change from Sybase, MySQL, IBM Db2 or SQL Server to Oracle should only require a testing cycle to be confident that both functional and non-functional performance has not been adversely affected.

===Application migration===
Changing application vendor—for instance a new CRM or ERP platform—will inevitably involve substantial transformation as almost every application or suite operates on its own specific data model and also interacts with other applications and systems within the enterprise application integration environment. Furthermore, to allow the application to be sold to the widest possible market, commercial off-the-shelf packages are generally configured for each customer using metadata. Application programming interfaces (APIs) may be supplied by vendors to protect the integrity of the data they must handle.

===Business process migration===
Business processes operate through a combination of human and application systems actions, often orchestrated by business process management tools. When these change they can require the movement of data from one store, database or application to another to reflect the changes to the organization and information about customers, products and operations. Examples of such migration drivers are mergers and acquisitions, business optimization, and reorganization to attack new markets or respond to competitive threat.

The first two categories of migration are usually routine operational activities that the IT department takes care of without the involvement of the rest of the business. The last two categories directly affect the operational users of processes and applications, are necessarily complex, and delivering them without significant business downtime can be challenging. A highly adaptive approach, concurrent synchronization, a business-oriented audit capability, and clear visibility of the migration for stakeholders—through a project management office or data governance team—are likely to be key requirements in such migrations.

== Migration as a form of digital preservation ==
Migration, which focuses on the digital object itself, is the act of transferring, or rewriting data from an out-of-date medium to a current medium and has for many years been considered the only viable approach to long-term preservation of digital objects. Reproducing brittle newspapers onto microfilm is an example of such migration.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Migration addresses the possible obsolescence of the data carrier, but does not address that certain technologies that use the data may be abandoned altogether, leaving migration useless.
* Time-consuming – migration is a continual process, which must be repeated every time a medium reaches obsolescence, for all data objects stored on a certain media.
* Costly – an institution must purchase additional data storage media at each migration.

<text>The minority leader in U.S. politics (as well as in some other countries utilizing the presidential system) is the floor leader of the second largest caucus in a legislative body. Given the two-party nature of the U.S. system, the minority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat. The position could be considered similar to that of the leader of the opposition in parliamentary systems. In bicameral legislatures, the counterpart to the minority leader in the lower house is the speaker, and the majority leader is hence only the second-most senior member of the majority caucus. Contrastingly, in upper houses, the titular speaker is frequently a separately elected officer such as a lieutenant governor or vice president.

The minority leader is often assisted in their role by one or more whips, whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote against the position of the party leaders. Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures (such as demotion from choice committee assignments) for members who violate the party line; decisions such as these are often made by the minority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders.

In a state where the executive branch and both houses of the state legislature are controlled by the other party, the minority leader of one of the houses (most often the upper one) may be seen as the most senior member of the party in that state with regard to state government (although inferior in rank to a United States senator or United States representative, if there be such in that party from that state). 

At times, particularly during crucial legislation, the minority leader may be consulted by the opposite leader in order to more easily get things passed and ensure that provisions important to the interests the minority party be included. The level of partisanship in state legislative bodies varies greatly from one state to another.

<text>Ellen Karolina Sofia Key (; 11 December 1849 – 25 April 1926) was a Swedish difference feminist writer on many subjects in the fields of family life, ethics and education and was an important figure in the Modern Breakthrough movement. She was an early advocate of a child-centered approach to education and parenting, and was also a suffragist. 

She is best known for her book on education (1900), which was translated into English in 1909 as &quot;The Century of the Child&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ellen Key was born at Sundsholm mansion in Småland, Sweden, on 11 December 1849. Her father was Emil Key, the founder of the Swedish Agrarian Party and a frequent contributor to the Swedish newspaper &quot;Aftonposten&quot;. Her mother was Sophie Posse Key, who was born into an aristocratic family from the southernmost part of Skåne County. Emil bought Sundsholm at the time of his wedding; twenty years later he sold it for financial reasons. 

Key was mostly educated at home, where her mother taught her grammar and arithmetic and her foreign-born governess taught her foreign languages. She cited reading (&quot;The Official&#x27;s Daughters&quot;, 1855) by Camilla Collett and Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s plays (&quot;Love&#x27;s Comedy&quot;, 1862), &quot;Brand&quot; (1865), and &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1867) as her childhood influences. When she was twenty years old, her father was elected to the Riksdag and they moved to Stockholm, where she would capitalize on the access to libraries. Key also studied at the progressive Rossander Course.

===1870s===
After a correspondence with , who wrote (&quot;The Protestant Cult of Mary&quot;, 1874), she had written a review of the book for a periodical, under the pseudonym Robinson. His book gave her thoughts structure, helping to define her beliefs concerning the role of women as mothers and nurturers. Key hoped Feilitzen would leave his wife, as they did not share similar interests, but he refused.

In the summer of 1874, Key traveled to Denmark and studied their folk colleges. Folk colleges were institutions of higher learning for young people from the countryside. One of her early ambitions was to found a Swedish folk high school, but instead she decided, in 1880, to become a teacher at Anna Whitlock&#x27;s school for girls in Stockholm.

Shortly after she moved to Stockholm, she befriended Sophie Adlersparre, who was the editor of &quot;Tidskrift för Hemmet&quot; (&quot;Journal for the Home&quot;), founded in 1859 by Adlersparre and Rosalie Olivecrona. In 1874 published her first article. It was about Camilla Collett, and other articles soon followed. She would also do some biographical studies on George Eliot and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The Fredrika Bremer Association, the liberal women&#x27;s organization, was founded in 1884. Many of the writers for were members.

===1880s===
In 1883, Key began teaching at Anton Nyström new school, the People&#x27;s Institute, which was founded in 1880. She also helped organize &quot;The Twelves&quot;, a group of twelve upper class ladies who sponsored and organized social functions to help improve working class ladies&#x27; manners.

In 1885, she was one of the five founding members of the women&#x27;s society Nya Idun, along with Calla Curman, Hanna Winge, Ellen Fries, and Amelie Wikström. She also spoke at Curman&#x27;s &quot;Curman receptions&quot;, salons held several times a year which featured a number of the intellectuals of the day.

Even though Key did share a lot of similar beliefs with the members of the Fredrika Bremer Association, two main issues made her oppose the group in the mid-1880s: the importance of sexuality and the social significance of the biological differences between women and men. 1886 saw Key publishing (&quot;On the Reaction against the Woman Question&quot;) which was highly critical and argued against the egalitarian tendencies of the Swedish women&#x27;s movement. The piece was published in Gustaf af Geijerstam&#x27;s journal (&quot;Review of Literary and Social Issues&quot;).

Also in 1886, she wrote a review of (&quot;A Summer Story&quot;, 1886) by Anne Charlotte Leffler in the short-lived journal &quot;&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot;). She was critical of the piece for having one woman&#x27;s attempt to combine marriage, motherhood, and a career as an artist. In 1886, she became one of the founders of the Swedish Dress Reform Society.

Key contributed to three journals all with different views on women&#x27;s rights: , , and . The latter was edited by Alma Åkermark from Gothenburg and tended to have taboo information, including publishing texts on syphilis, sexual repression and socialism. Mathilda Malling&#x27;s (&quot;Pyrrhic Victories&quot;), published in 1886 under the pseudonym Stella Kleve, was very controversial among Scandinavian intellectuals. The story dealt with a dying young woman, who laments that if she had done the things she wanted to do, she may not be dying.

Also in (&quot;Natural Lines of Work for Women&quot;) and (&quot;Female Psychology and Logic&quot;, 1896) Key said a &quot;monogamous heterosexual relationship aimed toward procreation formed the crux of a woman&#x27;s happiness and fulfillment.&quot;

In 1889, she published (&quot;Some Thoughts about How Reactions Begin&quot;), which marked her a social radical, which she would never deny.

===Changing views===
Key grew up in an atmosphere of liberalism, and throughout the 1870s her political beliefs were radically liberal. She was republican-minded, with the idea of freedom holding vast importance for her. As the 1880s advanced, her thinking became even more radical, affecting first her religious beliefs and then her views on life in society in general. This was the outcome of extensive reading. During the latter part of the 1880s and particularly in the 1890s, she began to read socialist literature and turned increasingly towards socialism.

Key was raised in a rigid Christian household, but while growing up she started questioning her views. From 1879 she studied Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer and T. H. Huxley. In the autumn of that year she met both Huxley and Haeckel, the German biologist and philosopher, in London. The principle of evolution, in which Key had come to believe, was also to have an influence on her educational views.

She is quoted as having said:

:&quot;Side by side with the class war, the culture war must ceaselessly be waged by the young and among the young upon whom rests the responsibility of making the new society better for all than the old could be.&quot;

===Later life===
In the late 1880s–early 1890s, Key decided to write biographies of women who had prominent roles in Swedish intellectual life; they were: Victoria Benedictsson, Anne Charlotte Leffler, and Sonia Kovalevsky. She would also write about Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Carl Jonas Love Almqvist.

In 1892 Key and Amalia Fahlstedt co-founded , an association which connected working women with educated middle-class women.

The Cambridge Chronicle of Cambridge, Massachusetts on October 19, 1912 noted that in The Atlantic Monthly, &quot;Ellen Key, the Swedish writer, who has had such immense influence over the woman movement throughout Europe, makes her first appearance in an American periodical with her article on &quot;Motherliness&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Woman Movement&quot; by Key was published in Swedish in 1909, and in an English translation in 1912 by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons.

After she retired from teaching, she met and helped the young poet Rainer Maria Rilke. She was later painted by Hanna Pauli. &quot;Die Antifeministen&quot; (&quot;The Antifeminists&quot;, 1902) by Hedwig Dohm cited both Key and Lou Andreas-Salomé as anti-feminists.

She died on 25 April 1926 at the age of 76.

==Selected works==
Key started her career as a writer in the mid-1870s with literary essays. She became known to a large public through the pamphlet &quot;On Freedom of Speech and Publishing&quot; (1889). Her name and her books then became the topic of lively discussions. The following work focuses on her views on education, personal freedom, and the independent development of the individual. These works include:

*&quot;Individualism and Socialism&quot; (1896)
*&quot;Images of Thought&quot; (1898)
*&quot;Human-beings&quot; (1899)
*&quot;Lifelines&quot;, volumes I-III (1903–06)
*&quot;Neutrality of the Souls&quot; (1916).

On education, her earliest article may be &quot;Teachers for Infants at Home and in School&quot; in &quot;Tidskrift för hemmet&quot; (1876). Her first more widely read essay, &quot;Books versus Coursebooks&quot;, was published in the journal &quot;Verdandi&quot; (1884). Later, in the same journal, she published other articles &quot;A Statement on Co-Education&quot; (1888) and &quot;Murdering the Soul in Schools&quot; (1891). Later she published the works &quot;Education&quot; (1897) and &quot;Beauty for All&quot; (1899).

In 1906 came &quot;Popular Education with Special Consideration for the Development of Aesthetic Sense&quot;. In the last books Key views aesthetics, as beauty and art, from the aspect of the elevation of humanity.

Several of Key&#x27;s writings were translated into English by Mamah Borthwick, during the period of her affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Among her best-known works published in English:

*&quot;The Morality of Woman&quot; (1911)
*&quot;Love and Marriage&quot; (1911, repr. with critical and biographical notes by Havelock Ellis, 1931)
*&quot;The Century of the Child&quot; (1909)
*&quot;The Woman Movement&quot; (1912)
*&quot;The Younger Generation&quot; (1914)
*&quot;War, Peace, and the Future&quot; (1916).

==Legacy==
She has inspired writers such as Selma Lagerlöf, Marika Stjernstedt, Waka Yamada and Elin Wägner. Maria Montessori wrote that she predicted the 20th century would be &quot;the century of the child&quot;.

Havelock Ellis wrote positively on her studies of human sexuality.

Key maintained that motherhood is so crucial to society that the government, rather than their husbands, should support mothers and their children. These ideas regarding state child support influenced social legislation in several countries.

A substantial collection of Key&#x27;s papers is at the Royal Library in Stockholm.

In the 1890s, Key commissioned the Strand house designed by architect Yngve Rasmussen. In the 1890s, it was &quot;a centre for the politically radical intellectual and artistic avant-garde of Stockholm&quot;. Key&#x27;s house has become a foundation and tourist spot.

<doc id="1135444" wikidata="Q7707390" url="?curid=1135444" title="Texas's 3rd congressional district">
<text>Texas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district of the United States House of Representatives is in the suburban areas north and northeast of Dallas. It encompasses much of Collin County, including McKinney and Allen, as well as parts of Plano, Frisco, and Prosper. Additionally, the district includes all but the southern portion of Hunt County. The district is also home to a public four-year university, Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce, as well as Collin College.

Texas has had at least three congressional districts since 1869. The current seat dates from a mid-decade redistricting conducted before the 1966 elections after Texas&#x27;s original 1960s map was thrown out by &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot;. In past configurations, it has been one of the most Republican districts in both Texas and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The GOP has held the seat since a 1968 special election. The district&#x27;s current congressman is Keith Self.

As of the 2010 census, the 3rd district represents 765,486 people who are predominantly middle-to-upper-class (median family income is US$80,912). The district is 59.1 percent White (non-Hispanic), 15.06 percent Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 13 percent Asian, and 8.9 percent Black or African American.

From 1967 to 2013, the district included large portions of Dallas County. Eventually, the 3rd covered much of northern Dallas County, including Garland, Rowlett and much of northern Dallas itself. It was pushed into Collin County in 1983. Since then, Collin County&#x27;s rapid growth resulted in the district&#x27;s share of Dallas County being gradually reduced. After redistricting in 2012, the Dallas County portion of the district was removed altogether. However, it still includes the Dallas precincts located in Collin County.

== 2021 redistricting ==
From 2013 to 2021, the district represented suburban areas north and northeast of Dallas. It encompassed much of Collin County, including McKinney, Plano, and the majority of Frisco, as well as a portion of the city of Dallas. The district was also home to the public college Collin College, and the Frisco campus of the University of North Texas.

After redistricting in 2021, the Dallas and Richardson portions of the district were removed, as well as much of Plano and Frisco. The Richardson portion of the district was transferred to District 32, while the Plano, Dallas, and Frisco portions were given to District 4. In return, District 3 was expanded eastward to encompass most of Hunt County.

Adam P. Bell was the first Democrat to run for Texas&#x27;s 3rd since the redistricting effort of 2012.



===2018===

The incumbent representative, Sam Johnson, decided not to run for reelection in 2018, after having represented Texas&#x27;s 3rd since 1991. His stated reason for retiring was that &quot;the Lord has made clear that the season of my life in Congress is coming to an end&quot;.

<text>Ballito is an affluent coastal town located in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Ballito is about north of Durban and 24 kilometres (15 mi) south of KwaDukuza. It forms part of the KwaDukuza Local Municipality, and iLembe District Municipality. Dolphins and Whales are common on this stretch of the North Coast shoreline, hence the nickname Dolphin Coast.

Prior to 1 December 2023, vehicle registration plates in Ballito started with NT - N for Natal, T for Lower [[Ballito|Tugela]], a river that lies about 45 kilometres to the north.

==History==
The town was established in 1954 as a private township, by the Glen Anil Development Corporation/Investments which was headed up by Dr Edward (Eddie) Rubenstein (1903–1972). The town&#x27;s name was borrowed from a glossy advert for Ballito hosiery made by Ballito Hosiery Limited of St. Albans, England. The area was originally portion of a sugar cane farm at Compensation Beach owned by Basil Townsend.

The Sunday Tribune printed in 1954 an advert for Ballito Bay inviting potential investors to the North Coast with prices of land from R790.00 (395 SA Pounds). By 1964 the zonings for Ballitoville&#x27;s residential buildings, hotels and a caravan park had already been incorporated into the town plan known as Compensation Beach and this area stretched out from Willard Beach to Clark Bay, Salmon Bay and Port Zimbali. A brochure with the first marketing pictures of Ballito, was put out to attract the holiday makers to invest in the area with the slogan: &quot;Buy, Build &amp; Play at Ballito Bay, The Caribbean of the North Coast – Natal&quot;. Ballito, Salt Rock and Shaka&#x27;s Rock are favourite holiday destinations for local South Africans and also foreign tourists on their way to Zululand and the historical battlefields.

Jack Nash (1914–2016) gives a personal history from the early beginning of Ballito through to 1986 when he left the area and includes a history of some of the early pioneers and characters of the town. These include his father-in-law, Reg Fripp, who built many of the early houses. Jack Nash, who lived until shortly before his death in Amber Valley, Howick, own history includes being the Estate Agent for Glen Anil in Ballito through to him being the Chairman of the Ballito and the North Coast Publicity Associations. Jack&#x27;s wife Gaye Nash née Fripp, the young ballet dancer holding the &quot;little ball&quot; or ballito above her head in the full page press release to publicise the then new township in the Sunday Tribune of 23 November 1954, still lives in Howick.

== Geography ==
Located at the entrance to the Dolphin Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, Ballito is roughly bordered by Shaka’s Rock to the north and Zimbali to the south. The region of Ballito is sub-divided into various suburbs, namely; Ballito proper, Shaka’s Head, Umhlali Golf and Country Estate, Port Zimbali and Zimbali Estate and it incorporates the neighbouring coastal villages of Shaka’s Rock, Salt Rock, Umhlali, Sheffield Beach and Tinley Manor Beach.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Healthcare ===
Ballito is served by the Netcare Alberlito Hospital, owned by one of South Africa&#x27;s largest private healthcare groups, Netcare. Public healthcare in Ballito is offered at the Ballito Clinic, which falls under the jurisdiction of the General Justice Gizenga Mpanza Regional Hospital (previously Stanger Provincial Hospital) in KwaDukuza. 

=== Transport ===

The N2 national route (North Coast Toll Road) is the main freeway passing Ballito from KwaDukuza in the north to Durban in the south, with off-ramps at Ballito Drive. The R102 runs north/south, bypassing Ballito from Umhlali in the north to oThongathi in the south. The coastal M4 runs north/south from Ballito to uMhlanga (passes through Ballito as Ballito Drive and Leo Boyd Highway). Both the R102 and M4 are the untolled alternative routes to the N2 northbound and southbound. 

==Tourism==
Today Ballito is a thriving community of its own with ties to primary and high schools in and around Ballito, uMhlanga, KwaDukuza (Stanger) and oThongathi (Tongaat). Ballito has grown exponentially in recent times and has three shopping malls, The Lifestyle Centre, Odyssey, and Ballito Junction. 

Ballito has a strong tourism economy, home to a number of family adventure attractions such as the crocodile farm and microlight flights and tours. It is a holiday destination with hotels and self-catering accommodation, swimming (Willard) and surfing beaches (Boulder). A promenade about long along the beach front allows for walking and jogging. The Gunston 500 surfing contest, renamed Ballito Pro sponsored by Billabong, has been shifted from the Bay of Plenty in Durban&#x27;s Golden Mile to Ballito where it is held annually in July.

There are four beaches along the Ballito stretch of beach including the main beach, Willard Beach as well as Salmon Bay Beach (non-swimming), Clarke Bay Beach and Thompson’s Bay Beach. Further north up the coast are the beaches of Salt Rock, Sheffield Beach and Tinley Manor.

==Economy==
===Business sector===
Ballito&#x27;s business sector has also grown significantly with a large commercial business park bordering the N2 freeway. With a full service industry within the commercial business park, Ballito now caters to a growing business community on the North Coast. Enterprise iLembe, the region&#x27;s investment arm, has been formed to develop Ballito and the iLembe area as an investment destination of choice. The development of the King Shaka International Airport and Dube TradePort to the south have also contributed significantly to the growth of Ballito.

===Retail===
The recent investments in Ballito have positioned the town as the main retail hub along the North Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, servicing the coastal region with a wide variety of shopping centres, motor dealerships and other retail amenities.

Ballito is mainly served by the Ballito Junction Regional Mall, the second largest shopping centre north of Durban after the Gateway Theatre of Shopping in uMhlanga. Smaller shopping centres in the vicinity of Ballito include Ballito Lifestyle Centre, New Salt Rock Shopping Centre and Tiffany&#x27;s Shopping Centre.

==Growth==
In recent years, there has been a population boom in Ballito. Various secure or gated estates, the largest being Zimbali Estate followed by Simbithi, have been built in and around the town on land that was previously used as sugar cane farms. Many new hotels and resorts have opened, drawing even more tourists into this picturesque part of the KwaZulu-Natal coast. Plans are currently on the table for new schools to be constructed, a new town centre, a taxi rank, and a larger clinic. The main entrance to Ballito from the N2 highway has been upgraded, with the construction of an multi level interchange to ease traffic, the widening of the road to four lanes in Ballito Drive, and proper pedestrian walkways.

Today Ballito and its neighbours, Shaka’s Rock, Salt Rock and Sheffield Beach have virtually merged into one long strip of seaside towns. The Greater Ballito area also includes the nearby settlements of Umhlali, Shakaskraal and Tinley Manor Beach.

<doc id="1135455" wikidata="Q1960276" url="?curid=1135455" title="Modern Electrics">
<text>Modern Electrics was a technical magazine for the amateur radio experimenter. The magazine existed between 1908 and 1914.

==History and profile==
&quot;Modern Electrics&quot; was created by Hugo Gernsback and began publication in April 1908. The magazine was initially intended to provide mail-order information for radio parts and to promote the amateur radio hobby, but it later became a vehicle for technology-based fiction stories. The first fiction appeared in the April, 1911 issue, and the series of 12 installments by Hugo Gernsback would later be published as the science fiction novel &quot;Ralph 124C 41+&quot;.

The circulation for this magazine increased rapidly, starting at 2,000 and increasing to 52,000 in 1911. In 1908, the magazine announced the &quot;wireless registry&quot;, a listing of radio owners, their call letters, and the type of equipment they owned and how it was operated.

The magazine was sold in 1913, and ceased publication in 1914. It then merged with &quot;Electrician and Mechanic&quot; to become &quot;Modern Electrics and Mechanics.&quot; The experience Gernsback gained with &quot;Modern Electrics&quot; led him to introduce &quot;Electrical Experimenter&quot; magazine in 1913 and pulp science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1926.

<doc id="1135462" wikidata="Q2141681" url="?curid=1135462" title="Secure Electronic Transaction">
<text>Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) is a communications protocol standard for securing credit card transactions over networks, specifically, the Internet. SET was not itself a payment system, but rather a set of security protocols and formats that enabled users to employ the existing credit card payment infrastructure on an open network in a secure fashion. However, it failed to gain attraction in the market. Visa now promotes the 3-D Secure scheme.

Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) is a system for ensuring the security of financial transactions on the Internet. It was supported initially by Mastercard, Visa, Microsoft, Netscape, and others. With SET, a user is given an electronic wallet (digital certificate) and a transaction is conducted and verified using a combination of digital certificates and digital signatures among the purchaser, a merchant, and the purchaser&#x27;s bank in a way that ensures privacy and confidentiality

== History and development ==

SET was developed by the SET Consortium, established in 1996 by Visa and Mastercard in cooperation with GTE, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, SAIC, Terisa Systems, RSA, and VeriSign. The consortium’s goal was to combine the card associations&#x27; similar but incompatible protocols (STT from Visa/Microsoft and SEPP from Mastercard/IBM) into a single standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET/2100-1017-225723&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

SET allowed parties to identify themselves to each other and exchange information securely. Binding of identities was based on X.509 certificates with several extensions. SET used a cryptographic blinding algorithm that, in effect, would have let merchants substitute a certificate for a user&#x27;s credit card number. If SET were used, the merchant itself would never have had to know the credit-card numbers being sent from the buyer, which would have provided verified good payment but protected customers and credit companies from fraud.

SET was intended to become the de facto standard payment method on the Internet between the merchants, the buyers, and the credit-card companies.

Unfortunately, the implementation by each of the primary stakeholders was either expensive or cumbersome. There were also some external factors that may have complicated how the consumer element would be integrated into the browser. There was a rumor circa 1994-1995 that suggested that Microsoft sought an income stream of 0.25% from every transaction secured by Microsoft&#x27;s integrated SET compliant components they would implement in their web browser.

== Key features ==
To meet the business requirements, SET incorporates the following features:
* Confidentiality of information
* Integrity of data
* Cardholder account authentication
* Merchant authentication

== Participants ==
A SET system includes the following participants:
* Cardholder
* Merchant
* Issuer
* Acquirer
* Payment gateway
* Certification authority

===How it works===
Both cardholders and merchants must register with the CA (certificate authority) first, before they can buy or sell on the Internet. Once registration is done, cardholder and merchant can start to do transactions, which involve nine basic steps in this protocol, which is simplified.
# Customer browses the website and decides on what to purchase
# Customer sends order and payment information, which includes two parts in one message:
#:a. Purchase order – this part is for merchant
#:b. Card information – this part is for merchant’s bank only.
# Merchant forwards card information to their bank
# Merchant’s bank checks with the issuer for payment authorization
# Issuer sends authorization to the merchant’s bank
# Merchant’s bank sends authorization to the merchant 
# Merchant completes the order and sends confirmation to the customer
# Merchant captures the transaction from their bank
# Issuer prints credit card bill (invoice) to the customer
== Dual signature ==
As described in :

The message digest (MD) of the OI and the PI are independently calculated by the customer. These are concatenated and another MD is calculated from this. Finally, the dual signature is created by encrypting the MD with the customer&#x27;s secret key. The dual signature is sent to both the merchant and the bank. The protocol arranges for the merchant to see the MD of the PI without seeing the PI itself, and the bank sees the MD of the OI but not the OI itself. The dual signature can be verified using the MD of the OI or PI, without requiring either the OI or PI. Privacy is preserved as the MD can&#x27;t be reversed, which would reveal the contents of the OI or PI.

After 1999 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election, he became the Rural Development Minister of Maharashtra in the Congress-NCP coalition government in October 1999. He became the Home Minister of Maharashtra on 25 December 2003. After taking charge of Home Ministry, he also sought guardianship of naxal activity affected district Gadchiroli. Since then, in spite of many naxal attacks, he encouraged natives to support elected government through some developmental work for them. On 1 November 2004, he was sworn in as the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra. He was also the chief of the Nationalist Congress Party&#x27;s Maharashtra unit and NCP legislative party in Maharashtra.

He was a politician in Maharashtra, also christened as &#x27;Mr Clean&#x27; in political circles due to his clean image in the erstwhile tainted political party and also due to cleanliness awareness initiatives like &quot;Gadage Baba Swachata Abhiyan&quot; and &quot;Tantamukt Gaon&quot;.

==Controversy==
His comments in the aftermath of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks have drawn severe criticism for downplaying the gravity of the situation. He was quoted as saying, &quot;They (the terrorists) came to kill 5,000 people but we ensured minimal damage&quot;. Sources close to him have argued that his comments are being taken out of context and that he did not intend to downplay the grievous attack.

He resigned on 1 December 2008 after further remarks on the attacks. When asked at a press conference whether the terror strike was an intelligence failure Patil said, &quot;It is not like that. In big cities like this, incidents like this do happen. It&#x27;s [sic] is not a total failure.&quot; Patil&#x27;s words drew flak from many quarters. Mumbai residents who saw him say this on television or were told about it by reporters pointed out the irony of politicians making such statements after being provided high security.

==Death==
Patil died at Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre after a long fight with oral cancer. Patil showed signs of improvement after his initial treatment and was taken off life support in January 2015, but he succumbed to the disease on 16 February 2015. The last rites were performed in Anjani village in Tasgaon area of Sangli district, Maharashtra on 17 February 2015. Patil&#x27;s funeral was held with state honours, including a 21-gun salute by the Maharashtra government and was attended by the Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Anna Hazare, Sharad Pawar and other political leaders from various parties.
